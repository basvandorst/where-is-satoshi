I wonder if these amendments came in now because if they can offer an ETF that's preferable to the Winklevoss ETF, the SEC might postpone their decision until they v can weigh up which they'd prefer to see go live, or not.

Do you have a source for this? I'm not being difficult, just curious to see what apps developers would like to build.

But there would no longer be any incentive for the miners to maintain the network.
@_date: 2016-08-31 22:11:17
I think this would encourage *some* adoption, but lets be honest, how many people with cash in the bank in 2008 went and bought up gold to protect themselves? I know the analogy isn't exactly fitting, but the point is most people just accept the cards they're dealt. I imagine real adoption will come in the form of apps that are too convenient and cost effective to pass up.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:40:52
You make it sound like it'll never happen though. This is what the road to adoption looks like.

You hit the nail on the head. It's a shame he has so many useful idiots behind him. 
On the other hand, apart from similarly self-interested businesses and individuals, the greater bitcoin community and industry will not be boarding the Ver train. His project is destined to die, but how long that will take is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:39:06

@_date: 2016-08-24 13:44:25
Thanks for your reply.
I'm a pretty basic user so I don't think I would ever be making use of those kinds of features unless my wallet integrated them (if that's how it works!). It's interesting to learn what's being worked on though.
@_date: 2016-08-05 21:59:54
I can see the forked chain surviving for a while like ETC has, but expect the industry will leave it behind pretty quickly. From what I can see, raising the block size to 2mb is the full extent of their roadmap. It hardly inspires confidence. I guess we'll find out soon enough.
@_date: 2016-08-19 14:44:09
There are 4 days left until they either pass the ETF or take a 90 day extension on the decision making.
@_date: 2016-08-17 05:37:47
It's already quite editable. 
I turned off the coloured tabs, added icons to the bookmarks on the bookmark bar, turned the URL field back to default, and turned off the thing where it previews the page of the tab you're hovering over.
Edit: also the developers listen to constructive criticism - so if you could be more specific with what you would like changed you might just find they implement options for it.

Even though the big block supporters are pretty vocal over on r/btc, I think they overestimate the backing their project will get from the wider community. IMHO the sooner it happens (and fades away) the better.

I don't know how pro-bitcoin hackers are, but it will be interesting to see if projects like this attract any special attention from them. They might be inclined to point out the flawed thinking behind "creating" ledger technology, and labelling it distributed ledger technology, by exploiting vulnerabilities that are a result of their centralized nature.
@_date: 2016-08-24 13:35:23
Good read, and the article poses some interesting questions. I guess as theymos suggested in his answer above - optional fungibility would provide privacy with the choice to be public about spending, but that level of privacy might aggravate regulation or even threats from the state.

There are some videos on the site, but no real tutorials on how to use the software. 
Ironically people use the big centralized exchanges because they trust them more than random strangers online, so I think a few guides on how it works would give news users some peace of mind they're not gonna get screwed.

Ermagherd, what's it all mean?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:43:30
Nah, as the guy below pointed out, the community and infrastructure are much more robust and diverse now, plus a lot less money was lost than when Gox went to shit. 6 months was probably an overestimate.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:55:06
Since writing that I think 6 was an actually an overstatement. 
Think about it; bitcoin price dropped for 12 months when Gox hit - a theft worth 5 times as much as bitfinex and at a time when bitcoin was less advanced, less robust and was suffering from a poorer public image.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:33:12
It could be hidden from them, payment apps using/exchanging bitcoin in the background but displaying everything in fiat to the user. Just a guess.

Not that this isn't good news, but I'm not convinced that just accepting bitcoin will make a big difference to adoption. Bolder projects that make the most of bitcoins strengths are where the the real explosions will be seen - Abra, Yours, Brave being good examples.

IMHO he's up there with the unpredictability of the Chinese gov. on the list of substantial threats to bitcoin. He *must* know BU is destined to fail, and the fork will do more harm than good to the reputation/price/whatever of bitcoin, but he'll do it anyway to spite Core for not heeding his prophetic advice. He needs to get over himself.
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:21:35
None of that can happen until segwit is released. 2016 has already been exciting, so will 2017.
Rootstock and Winklevoss ETF could also push price up.
I wouldn't expect any big price changes for a few months.

The bitcoin to blockchain shift is there for all to see, but yeah, not sure if the pendulum swing has started coming back down yet.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:19:58
If you think about it, it can only come down to cutting corners. As if Gox wasn't enough of a lesson. This will set bitcoin back at least 6months from a price/reputation perspective. Can't see the ETF going through now either.
@_date: 2016-08-24 14:16:06

My guess is we won't get it until next year :(
Edit: the ETF, not the decision obviously!
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:52:40
It doesn't solve any technical problems, but it makes bitcoin appear like a more legitimate investment vehicle in more conservative circles opening up a potential pool of wealth to flood the space. I would imagine it's also more practical for wealth managers who aren't setup to use exchanges and there may be financial advantages to an ETF that exchanges can't provide (tax breaks, wrappers etc.).
@_date: 2016-08-15 10:51:39
I know what you mean, but to use the admittedly tired internet analogy - just because something starts life as incomprehensible to the lay person it doesn't mean it will stay that way forever. 
Even simple internet apps such as email haven't always been as easy to use as they are today. Understandably, the UX side of tech is often overlooked in the early stages of development.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:05:17

@_date: 2016-08-24 13:29:16
Thanks for your reply!


I'm quite a basic user - bought to hodl and have only really used bitcoin on Steam, to buy a Trezor, and make some charity donations. With something like this is it up to wallets to decide to include the feature and run it by default or does it tend to require more proactive use on the users behalf?
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:49:34
No, I see all the BIPs as pushing boundaries. AFAIK these are all new developments in one of the coolest technologies around... it's exciting to me anyway :/
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:33:29
I could have explained myself better, but I have a feeling you knew what I meant anyway.
@_date: 2016-08-30 08:11:36
That's weird. In an interview with the CEO he was saying how they spent months teaching tellers and setting up relationships with exchanges all over the world prior to releasing the app. Hope it lives up to its promise, not least because there'll be an opportunity to earn interest on your bitcoin if you're a hodler.
@_date: 2016-08-24 11:27:51
This. Ignoring a weakness isn't going to make it go away. The first step to making improvements is identifying what needs to be improved.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:34:27
Yeah, 6 months might have been an exaggeration, considering less capital was lost and bitcoin is more robust now than it was then. It's still frustrating af :p
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:25:48
I should have been clearer. I meant, for example, if you had $100,000 worth of bitcoin, whether that is made up of 2,000 bitcoin or 1 bitcoin, and bitcoin isn't accepted at the vendor.
@_date: 2016-04-10 22:17:54

This kind of sensationalist "journalism" is so painful to read. 
The fact it gets upvoted makes me think there are shills in here after all.
@_date: 2016-08-26 17:58:47
True. The vast majority of people just don't have the time or inclination to find out what the advantages of bitcoin are, let alone try to buy and use them.
Big institutions - maybe. But I'm betting the first time your average Joe comes into contact with bitcoin, they won't even realise they're using it (on an app like Abra, for example).
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:07:41
The details are wrong, but it is pretty impressive how robust the perception of bitcoin is becoming... especially considering there are people out there just waiting for things like this to happen so they can trot out the same old story about how bitcoin is doomed to fail.
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:06:57
If you read any of his posts he comes across as someone who is self-entitled, unreasonable, and not used to not getting their own way. 
I don't think he's intentionally trying to do harm to the future of bitcoin, he's just shortsighted and egotistical.

@_date: 2016-08-27 18:55:32
Abra, Yours, Brave... are they not apps integrating bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-09 16:16:59


There is a clear path, it's just that some people disagree with the order it's being implemented in.
@_date: 2016-04-23 16:01:41
I learned that the price goes up and down.
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:06:33
I think this is probably the best thing bitcoin has going for it right now. It might not be that useful for most of us in the developed world, but that doesn't make it any less important.
Until accessing bitcoin becomes more straightforward, and we see more infrastructure and innovation in the space, fiat is still the most convenient and secure way of managing money for the majority of banked people.

The certainty really bugs me, too. A bitcoin could be worth $5 in a few years for all we know.
What is interesting is to reasonably speculate how bitcoin could reach a high value, and what that might look like on a graph.

There's nothing wrong with homeschooling per se, but my point was that schools and everything else paid for largely by income tax are important. Mandatory homeschooling would be a terrible burden on the majority of families where the parents need their full-time jobs.
I agree with you on the rest. The transparency and accountability that goes along with bitcoin is perfect for ensuring public funds get spent accordingly. Income tax is not the problem.

What about the argument that users don't need to know what's going on in the background, they just hit 'pay' and the wallet figures out what to do.
Let's face it, most people have no idea what happens when they use their debit / credit card. All they know, and all they care about, is that they are given what they have just paid for.

Tax is the one thing I hope any regulation of cryptocurrencies deals with early on. Personally I think people who want to avoid paying tax are greedy, unrealistic idiots. I'm convinced a significant percentage of the general public would back regulation of cryptocurrencies when it comes to income tax, because they understand how important it is for maintaining the infrastructure of our societies which we rely so heavily upon. Will be interesting to see how it plays out.
@_date: 2016-04-26 11:16:00
Why is this post not at the top of the front page? Is it not a big concern that so much of bitcoins exchange volume is a result of capital flight out of China?

This. Too many people in the bitcoin community seem either ignorant or dismissive of the reality of how the world works. IMHO bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency for that matter, will have to jump through certain government hoops if it is ever going to be adopted en masse. At least for a while.

I should have been clearer. If you couldn't use bitcoin to buy what you wanted, and had to convert back to USD or whatever.
@_date: 2016-04-24 11:37:33
It really is. 
Ironically, the closer we get to perceiving a "non-thing" as being valuable, such as bitcoin, the closer we get to the root of what it means for something to have worth in a monetary system. 
Since the removal of the gold standard, the *concept* of value is the only thing that attributes value to an object, rather than the inherent properties of the object or whatever it is pegged to... which is counterintuitive because we're so conditioned to trading objects for other objects, rather than concepts for objects - even though that's exactly what we have been doing ever since we lost the gold standard.
I think I just fried my brain.

Bitcoin has so many applications, it depends what you mean by mainstream. It's possible for example that in X years time bitcoin dominates the remittance market and still the average person on the street would never have heard of it.
I can't see the lay person using bitcoin as its own currency for some time. The keys, the wallets, the exchanges, the confirmations, the volatility, the absence of insurance... it's a long way from being an intuitive end-to-end experience, and needs to be considerably dumbed down and made less scary.
I expect it will take an apps/service built on top of bitcoin to go viral, before widespread adoption occurs. People won't give a shit, or even be aware that they're using bitcoin, but if there's a useful service that's cheaper or faster than anything else on the market then people will be drawn to it. I think Abra could be the first such app.
Companies like Yours and Brave using bitcoin for micropayments could also be the beginning of something special. Who knows, banks might even be using bitcoin some day. Whatever it is that's responsible for bitcoin going mainstream, if it ever happens, I don't it'll happen for 8+ years.

I posted this because I'm curious about the nature of a possible price rise to a new high. I can see two different paths to a high bitcoin price, but I would be interested to know what others think.
1. Potential catalysts for an explosive price rise - unforeseen innovation in the technical space or external political/economic pressure.
2. Potential catalyst for a gradual price rise - expanding infrastructure leading to greater accessibility and adoption of btc.
Does anyone else have other ideas?

Think you're being a bit flippant. A bitcoin split calls into question the value proposition of something which is supposed to have a finite supply.

I think BU supporters overestimate the market's desire for a BU bitcoin. It's hard to say what percentage of bitcoin *users* would want BU holding the reins but the support for Core and, more specifically for segwit, is near-unanimous from the industry who is building everything on top of bitcoin. Take that away and introduce code from a tiny group of inexperienced, anonymously financed developers, give mining centralization a bump, and stifle future innovation and the industry will start looking for more technically promising currencies.
A very vocal, well-financed minority want the fork to happen, but they would have made the switch by now if they knew the rest of the bitcoin world was behind them. The fact they haven't done so suggests they know the rest of the bitcoin world is *not* behind them.

@_date: 2017-02-06 22:13:12
My understanding is that bigger blocks make running a full node less feasible for many people (more demanding storage and bandwidth requirements). As full nodes are what keep miners in check, if too many fall behind or get switched off it will create an environment where it's easier for miners to game transactions. 
Might not be the best explanation, but the people in the know seem to feel this is a legit concern.

No, because I'm not trying to compel you to believe me, or him. I was simply relaying his anecdote about how destructive the toxicity in the bitcoin community can be, and did so earnestly because I trust he wouldn't make such a story up. You now have as much info as I do - trust it, distrust it, dismiss it altogether, do what you want with it.


I wrote what I thought was a long and interesting post asking Adam some questions earlier, and he didn't reply either. Never go full paranoid. Maybe he thought it was an unproductive use of his time. I'm certainly starting to feel that way.

I have a problem with the entitled and insulting nature of the replies. 
Most of the people there are literally *demanding* how developers (many of whom are volunteers) spend their time. Don't you see a problem with that type of behaviour? 
As Adam said - it's already pushed much-needed talent out of the developer community. At the very least people should be respectful to the devs, especially if they are asking things of them. There are very few reasonable voices in rbtc, they don't to themselves *any* favours.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:07:46
There are more articulate people who can do a better job of explaining it, but I'll give it a go.
For me the true value of bitcoin lies in its decentralized and a-political nature. 
Bitcoin is currently, and AFAICT has always been, a very inefficient currency - it's slower than most payment methods out there and the user experience is pretty shit, let's be honest. It takes a while to get comfortable with the idea of public/private keys, different types of wallets, and buying it in the first place. It *could* become a remarkable currency too in time, but increasing the blocksize is not a sustainable strategy for achieving this, and is actually quite dangerous IMO.
The decentralized and a-political properties of bitcoin are intrinsically linked. Bigger blocks weaken bitcoin's decentralization, by making it harder for the average user to run a full node. Since nodes are there to keep miners from behaving badly, fewer nodes in play will make gaming bitcoin a viable option for miners. If the pendulum swings too far in the miners favour then we're left with just another privately owned payment option - at which point bitcoin's transaction throughput becomes irrelevant. Hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-02-11 14:02:47
Fair enough. I didn't understand the point you were trying to make the first time round.
Politics and ego have certainly become serious obstructions. Not unsurpassable, but may slow things down to the point where we're stuck with what we've got. An interesting point Andreas made is that we have a small window currently to push through base layer changes to the protocol, and after that window closes, whenever that may be, the protocol will be frozen in time.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:10:43
Scary af. Surely that shows they *know* no one would go along with it otherwise. Makes me wonder what the fuck is actually going on in the minds of the miners.

They also put up with a lot of ridiculous bullshit, ironically often from people who are demanding that they spend their time doing XYZ. That would piss me off too.
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:50:15
It's possible that in the future neither you nor I will be able to afford those fees either - but neither of us will give a shit because we'll be using bitcoin in a different way by then. 
Currently those fees are much cheaper than other remittance services charge, and are insignificant if you are buying bitcoin to preserve your wealth from corrupt governments etc... not everyone thinks about bitcoin's success hanging on whether or not they can buy a coffee with it.
@_date: 2017-02-02 15:14:37
Am I the only one who doesn't like the look of this? 
Unless Antpool are *giving* away free mining power, they are going to great lengths to hide how much mining power they actually control. First ViaBTC and now BTC.TOP - two mining pools that sprung up overnight with huge amounts of hashing power behind them, at the same time as Antpool's market share dropped slightly. Add to that the fact they're the biggest manufacturers of mining hardware and this starts to look really scary to me.

Where did I say that segwit had no negative sides? They're [right here]( for everyone to see. I couldn't find a similar open list of the costs of running BU from their developers BTW...
I didn't say that the blocksize limit shouldn never be changed either, but why would you want to take the riskier path to increasing the blocksize limit (which brings nothing else to the table), when there's a safer, highly-tested, peer reviewed path that also solves some of bitcoin's other faults and opens doors for further innovation? Seems like a no-brainer to me. 
Once BU has gone through a year of testing, thorough peer review, and has earned the kind of support SegWit has from bitcoin businesses - I'll be more interested in what they're offering. Right now it's a reckless proposal and is doing nothing but sow discontent and confusion in the community.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:56:35

Hmm, they're not going to let it through out of sympathy. The steps COIN has taken would have to have merit on their own. It might be possible for them to reapply if it doesn't go through (I don't know if that's the case, but I don't see why not)?
@_date: 2017-02-17 08:44:25
Not to mention we're never going to discover a new use case for dollars. Bitcoin is used largely for speculation and preserving wealth, but 5, 10, 15 years from now who knows how we'll be using it.

@_date: 2017-02-08 07:37:08
Thanks Adam. As a hodler and someone philosophically interested in bitcoin I'm right behind your vision for how bitcoin can reach it's full potential.
My biggest concern at the moment is the creation of what feels like a monopoly in mining. The narrative that miners ultimately control the fate of bitcoin might also be an illusion that's taken hold of a small but disproportionally powerful group of people who control huge amounts of hashing power. To make matters worse the miners are, intentionally or otherwise, poor at communicating their thought process and keep their cards very close to their chests (at least this is how it appears as a Western observer with no access to Chinese forums). I worry that the Fake News of the bitcoin world will prevail, and bitcoin will be lost. 
From the outside looking in, a big part of the problem seems to be communication and education between the devs and the industry on one side, and the miners on the other.
Can you comment on the state of communication between Core and the big Chinese pools? Do you know why they are playing games with BU support (would they *actually* put their trust in a BU bitcoin)? And what needs to happen for them to give segwit the green light?
After all, it's safe to say segwit has the support of the economic and technological majority, now we're just waiting on a handful of miners. Cheers. 
Edit: format
@_date: 2017-02-04 09:56:48
Yes and no. It would set the price of BTC back a good few years. It's supposed to be a platform for trust. A split will fuck that value proposition in the arse.
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:06:12


Because making blocks bigger simultaneously makes running a full node more inaccessible to regular users. The number *and* diversity of full nodes is important for keeping miners from behaving badly. Therefore to keep bitcoin healthy we need to make running a full node as viable as possible, to include the economically and technologically disadvantaged community. AFAIK in the bitcoin ecosystem there is no such thing as users having too much power. The same cannot be said for miners who benefit from a reduction in the number of nodes, as it makes behaving dishonestly easier. 


I can't find the quote, but Jihan Wu has publicly stated that Antpool will exploit bitcoins design flaws to the extent that it's profitable. Moore's Law won't level the playing field quickly enough - the centralization of mining is already a problem that we should do what we can not to make worse, ie. by making blocks too big.
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:21:06


You damage your own argument making points like this. Anyone can pull numbers out of their arse, and seeing as 25% of miners are already signalling for segwit you're not even trying to hide your lie. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:18:37
I was simplifying the point because there are other less obvious truths that people currently treat subjectively. SegWit providing on-chain scaling is, for example, a fact, but you'll see some people going around saying otherwise.
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:15:35
Unfortunately among those lunatic BU supporters seem to be a few miners.
@_date: 2017-02-05 10:38:47
I think you're probably right, and have often wondered what the state of communications is between developers and miners. It would make sense for Core to hire a full-time translator to either translate the weekly developer IRC meetups, or better yet present monthly update reports to the miners directly. I feel if the development process and status was made clear to them, and they are rational actors, they would definitely support Core more strongly.

FWIW anyone using the phrase blockstreamcore is clearly trying to play the conspiracy card.

@_date: 2017-02-06 20:07:49
Surely it's the number of transactions that fit in a block that we ought to care about, right? If you could squeeze a million transactions in 1kb everyone should be demanding smaller blocks, to encourage wider use of full nodes.
It seems unhelpful to think of things in terms of solutions. Other than being a malleability fix, segwit is a short-term scaling *improvement* which enables much more promising scaling improvements in the near future. BU by comparison supposedly offers a scaling improvement, and nothing else, at the expense of bitcoin's security. I can't understand why people aren't more risk averse when it comes to their money, but I'd imagine it's to do with intentionally misleading discussions going on in parts of the community. Anyway, nice to be able to talk about it civilly for once :)
@_date: 2017-02-04 10:42:18
Thing is, prominent Chinese miners like Jihan Wu rarely make public statements about their views on bitcoin development. Also, Antpool's hashrate drops considerably anytime one of these new pro-BU pools emerges out of thin air. Hardly inspires trust, does it?
@_date: 2017-02-01 11:00:50
20% growth sounds good, but there are probably much lower risk investments that could get you close. Considering how risky bitcoin is, if the returns dropped that much I'd considerably reduce my investment.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:39:49
My understanding was that in that scenario - one relatively small miner preventing an upgrade everyone else wants - the rest of the miners could orphan their blocks and pressure them into joining.
Given the kind of decisions they make is it surprising BU gets shit on? Don't they understand the simple fact that unpredictability is a terrible trait for a store of value/currency? It was designed specifically to be predictable. And yet if miners colluded, and in the absence of a grace period, we could all be using BU bitcoin tomorrow. Trust in bitcoin would be destroyed and the price would hit the floor. These aren't difficult concepts to understand.
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:44:43

I would be surprised if they aren't actually grateful to the devs for the work they do on Core, like most of us are (or at least ought to be, IMO).
From the outside it's impossible to tell what they think, however - the miners world feels very closed off to observers. Seems one or two have an ego and sense of entitlement though.

I was actually talking about your quotes.
Anyway, apologies if it came across that way - I didn't claim or suggest I knew who Adam was referring to, I was merely pointing out that he had made this statement himself (in a post he made some time earlier today).
Edit: there are people in this space who take pride in their professionalism, so yes, I'm happy to take those people at their word. It wasn't an especially outrageous claim, so not sure why you're getting hung up on my not investigating it further. As I said, if you don't think Adam is trustworthy feel free to dig deeper yourself.

I got the impression the last thing the Chinese gov wants is to push bitcoin into the OTC counter, where regulations mean fuck all. At least with healthy exchanges they can have some control over the flow of money.

And yet you want bitcoin to scale. On-chain scaling requires consensus, so by definition the community needs to choose a side. Your position only makes sense if you're willing to wait for second-layer scaling solutions. 
Also - bitcoin is bigger than the companies building on it. As much as these companies contribute to the value of bitcoin, if they aren't investing in the development of the tech, they may discover they've built a business model on the bitcoin of the future, not the bitcoin of today.

@_date: 2016-03-14 15:56:45
You're projecting. The only implication I made was that the growth in the altcoin market caps is not *solely* the result of the block size debate.
The example you made explicitly states that I believe bitcoin can't be usurped and we shouldn't be concerned about competition, which is nonsense. Maybe you shouldn't use examples that do a poor job of making your point for you?
I think we have a different idea of what FUD is, and how it gets circulated on forums like reddit, or you wouldn't have bothered replying.
@_date: 2017-02-11 12:59:01
History would suggest there are no silver bullets. I think his point was that SegWit is as clear cut an advantageous upgrade as we can expect to see, so if it doesn't go through then not much else has a chance either.

I'm not assuming anything - mining has a centralization problem right now.
Diminishing returns only kicks in after it is impossible for a single mining pool or hardware distributor to cause significant disruption to the network. It will make bitcoin more resistant to corruption, more secure, and more valuable.
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:33:24
I think 'entitled brat' is the phrase your looking for.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:22:16
A word of caution - I think this chart is deceptive and easily gamed.
Antpool/Bitmain/Jihan likely own or run considerably more than 17.34% of the hashrate, but have diversified through other pools. ViaBTC and BTC.TOP for example came out of nowhere with large amounts of hashing power at the same time that Antpool's dropped. I wish this was spoken about more by the community, but it's understandable why they might not want to.
@_date: 2017-02-18 15:06:30

Well thankfully there are a lot of smart people working on it, but some people here don't seem to understand that quality products don't develop themselves overnight.
Plus, I was careful to point out that it might or might not be bitcoin, which leads the way 10 years from now.
@_date: 2016-03-15 16:17:21
I guess that makes me part of the apparent majority who misunderstood bitcoin and thought it was more anonymous than it is... so basically if you know your friends public key, you can view their entire transaction history? 
Presumably it would still take some detective work for someone to manually go through each payment to find out who the accounts they have been transferring money to belong to.

This is genuinely my biggest fear when it comes to the future of bitcoin (and some of my savings). Predictability is one of bitcoin's strengths, so the waiving of a grace period is really at odds with convention. Supporters can't really be so deluded as to see how this unpredictable behaviour wouldn't spook investors and make the price bottom out.
@_date: 2017-02-04 11:27:32
I don't think there would be any economic interest in doing it though, because whatever they've decide to mine would be worthless - why would anyone want to use ThugCoin?
Otherwise, yes it would make sense.

Just increasing the block size isn't a long-term scaling solution full stop. Unless you actually *want* a bitcoin that is owned by Bitmain.
FWIW, bigger blocks than 1.7mb have been created using SegWit on testnet.

In other words... how BU rolls.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:44:35


I think you're right... that's velocity of money? I don't think that'll be too much of a problem until bitcoin becomes a better currency, which might take a couple more years. Also depends on what use cases for bitcoin start becoming more popular. It's hard to predict what will happen to a 'programmable money', but either way it's exciting!
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:33:02
There's a right and a wrong answer to the question: does segwit increase the blocksize?
*hint: the answer's yes*

It's unfortunate that the misinformation and lies are so rampant, and not many people are clued up enough to refute them accurately. I hope it doesn't present too much of an opportunity cost, and while it seems the most prolific rbtc antagonists are not genuine, I'm sure a lot of people benefit from the efforts of the devs.
Props to and all the others who fight the FUD. Doesn't get said enough!
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:26:39
You're right. I should have specified that by economic majority I meant businesses based on bitcoin.
Economic majority in terms of value of bitcoins held collectively by supporters of camp X or Y... it's pretty much impossible to know either way.
All social media platforms have their problems, but if you don't already I'd suggest looking outside of reddit too. Follow every established name in bitcoin you can find on twitter and see what they're saying about segwit.
Edit: FWIW I think the discussion in r/bitcoin stopped being healthy long before the 'content regulators' started moderating user activity.
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:25:10

I'm not sure how it works mate. I would imagine yes, but I have a feeling there's a minimum order you'd have to buy. Buying bitcoin directly is wiser for us average folk :)
@_date: 2017-02-20 10:55:17
I don't know if it's a problem that we should be worrying about, but as a rule the more decentralized mining is the more secure bitcoin is. That pretty much applies to every level of mining (country, company, individual). I'm more worried about a single company, Bitmain, having a monopoly on mining hardware, and using shady practices to conceal the size of their mining pool.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:25:10
It's kind of a problem if everyone is in love with the idea of not paying income tax. I don't know what state economies would be in if everyone suddenly stopped paying tax. Governments would have to find the money from somewhere, and I don't know how they would plug such a big hole.
@_date: 2016-03-25 19:57:03
That's not what caused the last spike, and IMO won't be what causes the next. Fiat isn't going anywhere soon, and I don't think bitcoin is either.

BTW the mempool was &lt; 10,000 just a few days ago, and will probably be so again in a few days time.

And (I'm making an assumption here), think about where you live, how well serviced you are, and what your financial situation is like.
To have stronger decentralization (better security), we should want a low  income, blue collar worker in SE Asia or Africa to be able to run a full node. Maybe that's unlikely to ever happen, but it's a goal we should be working towards, and BU sets us down a path in the opposite direction.
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:18:05
Given the relatively recent appearance of cryptocurrencies on the world stage and their slightly ethereal nature, at least during this potential transition from fiat to crypto, I would imagine security would be the biggest factor that consumers would be concerned with - and so any currency which could advertise itself as being the 'most secure' would be in a good position to thrive above others. At least until people become more comfortable with the idea of using cryptocurrencies, and can weigh up the tradeoffs between security and convenience more easily.

@_date: 2016-03-21 22:34:54
Is that what I said?
For one thing, there are dozens of Core developers. 
Secondly, I don't even pretend to understand the technical side of development. For the most part, I imagine a large number of the people on here don't either, but most wouldn't admit it. I suspect these include the most strident and vocal members of the bitcoin/reddit community, but everyone likes to have an opinion, right?
That's why I would rather put my faith in them.
@_date: 2016-03-28 11:35:15
Does anyone know a place to read substantial bitcoin news, with good writing and reporting?
A lot of what shows up here and in r/btc is absolute shite. There must be a dozen or so supposed "news" sites dedicated to crypto, but they rehash the same articles and the writing is just awful. Like one redditor commented the other day, I would rather have one website I could visit, which only published solid articles (no FUD, no circlejerk), even if it was just once a week.
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:35:06
I'm not sure which will come first. March 11th is the deadline for the SEC's decision, but they could publish it at any time between now and then.
Also, IMHO no one should invest their entire life savings in bitcoin. I understand the temptation, but it could still go tits up for any number of reasons.

@_date: 2017-02-21 22:37:45
Miners know better though. Either they're just using BU to pressure Core, or /*tin foil hat time*/ - the Chinese government have Bitmain in their pocket.
@_date: 2016-03-11 17:23:04

@_date: 2016-03-21 22:09:25
I don't know, but I trust the dev's judgement more than anyone's on here. There is no perfect solution, development takes time, there'll probably be mistakes, and bitcoin will survive for as long as it is useful.
It's good to take an active interest. It's bad to flog a dead horse.
@_date: 2016-03-22 14:29:20




I agree. Unfortunately I can't see the FUD community in r/btc dropping this bone anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:18:46
It sounded to me like the point was if option A is SegWit, option B is bitcoin remains unchangeable at the base layer. That's the choice. Obviously things can change, but that's where it seems we'll be for the next year or so.
@_date: 2017-03-23 09:54:44


If possible that would be another excellent solution to the current impasse. At the very least it would force miners to put their money where their mouth is.
Edit: has something like this been proposed, or is it possible?
@_date: 2017-02-03 23:15:38

Obviously I'm not sure, everyone is just guessing at this point. 
IMHO however, it would be a coin without a future, as no developers worth their salt would want to work on it - regardless of whether or not it's what the Chinese market wants. The miners and exchanges could call it what they want, but the developer community would recognise it as MinerCoin, centralised and boring.

Some consensus. 
I thought exchanges, wallets, users, and businesses were supposed to be in on the decision? That makes it sound as though we could all be using BU bitcoin tomorrow if the big pools decided on it :/
edit: also kinda scary that they decided on 75%... ie. the minimum required without the miners who are currently signalling for SegWit. Mining is shady as fuck.

I don't know why Microsoft stopped accepting bitcoin. It doesn't necessarily take anything away from the value of bitcoin, nor does it mean it will never be used by Microsoft again in the future.

That would only happen if the majority of industry, users and money followed BU; which there's no sign of happening.
I've had a hard time finding support for BU outside of Roger, Jihan (Bitmain), and a few aggrieved bloggers. Basically a small group of people who want to be CEO of Bitcoin, which on its own should tell you they don't understand what makes bitcoin valuable.

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:25:29
The daft thing is, I don't think there is anyone in rbtc *or* r/bitcoin that feel the fees are too low.
I think Roger just wants to feel important. He could be living on a sunny island enjoying life with his millions, or be setting up a charity to do good things, but instead he wants people in the crypto space to respect him and think he has interesting things to say.
To put it another way - if Roger was poor no one would listen to a word he says.

I think he must know BU doesn't stand a chance of gaining community wide support.

It should be clear by now that SegWit **CAN NOT** be activated while bad actors like Roger and Jihan Wu/Bitmain/Antpool have considerable social influence over the ecosystem.
The only options now are a UASF or a chain split. Which ever we end up with, I hope it happens soon. It will inevitably set back bitcoin some months if not years, but the damage done will only get worse the longer we have to wait for it to happen.

The problem there is that anybody running for parliament who advocated something of the sort would get laughed off the stage.


I didn't mean on a personal level, because as you pointed out - we are innately short-sighted and self-serving when it comes to things like this. At an institutional level however we have a chance to curb our bad habits, but I don't see any retrospective "punishment" flying here, bar the guilt which no doubt many do feel.

I have no idea but it worries me that no one seems to be talking about this, not publicly anyway. 
People *do* express their concerns about the centralization of mining power, but Antpool are the most influential pool with by far the most hashing power and no one seems to be raising the point. Also - the fact they can create pools with considerable hashing power behind them suggests they **own** that mining equipment, unless they are redirecting hash power from miners directed at their pool without asking them (if that's possible). Not that they can have necessarily done anything "wrong" yet, or that they could be held accountable anyway, but the way they operate appears from the outside to be shady af, and hyper-political.
Disappointed this post didn't generate more discussion. Feel free to use the chart if you'd like (which I made using data from Blockchain, and is not to be taken as gospel).

The Winklevoss brothers have been trying to get a bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) approved for coming on 4 years. If it gets passed by the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) it'll be the first instrument allowing traditional investors to buy into bitcoin without having to worry about security. It's expected to boost the price of bitcoin somewhat, and the final ruling is due in just over a month - March 11th I think.

$20b market cap begs to differ.
People are understandably fixated on the blocksize issue, although even this is misguided - people should focus on throughput if anything. However, Core has made a lot of improvements to the protocol over the years. And most importantly - bitcoin hasn't died. It's defended itself from numerous attacks, hasn't had a moments downtime and is more secure than it's ever been. That takes hard work, so it's a shame you think the only way Core could have "succeeded" is to have increased the blocksize. BU and the people pushing for it are the biggest threat to bitcoin IMHO, and unfortunately witnessing the chaos they create may be the only way to convince people like yourself of this.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:46:07
The enemy is what banks and the state stand for, which seems to be the same thing BU stands for. Same enemy, different flag.

I noticed on twitter Roger spread a shamefully dishonest and misleading tweet showing a graph of tx fee history (**exponential** increase) alongside Bitcoins % market cap history (**linear** decrease - go figure), and a picture of Greg. He's attempting to make the case that the increase in tx fees is directly responsible for the recent rise of the alt coins. I just wanted to point out what the much more likely story there is, with a couple of graphs that actually correlate (worth pointing out that the bottom graph is a little truncated - check the dates).
I can't decide whether he is the victim of the worlds most extraordinary case of confirmation bias in a human brain, or just lazily connecting dots at random to push his narrative that Core is evil and BU is here to save us.

If there are other beneficial upgrades that currently have consensus but require a HF and could be included in option 3, I would go with that.
Otherwise I would go with 2. However it makes sense that 4 is also prepared, *only* for use in the event of an attack that Bitcoin can't fend off with its remaining miners.
Communication with the wider community ought to be prioritised in any event.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:40:55

They're delusional.
Besides, it's completely irrelevant *who* exploited the bug. The issue is that the bug existed at all. Bitcoin has to be able to survive an adversarial world, why do supporters of BU expect enemies of bitcoin to give their buggy code a charitable free pass? It was an attack vector which someone could easily use to make money by shorting the price of bitcoin before exploiting it, were we unfortunate enough to have a $BTU floating around in the world.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:40:07
It's not about *just* about what existing holders own, it's about diluting the scarcity of the asset.
In other words, you may hold the same % as you did before the split, but there are still twice as many coins in circulation now - making it much less attractive to prospective first-time buyers or people who want to buy more. It also makes it more confusing for newbies, and the media will have a field day with "bitcoin can be printed on a whim just like fiat money can". Does that make sense to you?

It's not just easier, I think it's crucial for the community around BU to do anything they can to enforce the narrative that Core are responsible for everything that's wrong with bitcoin. It's why we see so much truth-twisting and flat out lying in rbtc - the community couldn't survive without it when there's no bitcoin development of merit for them to gather around.
Edit: grammar
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:23:15
The uncertainty of the future of bitcoin is being factored into the current pricing though. I have bought a few, but if I knew for a fact the price would (more-or-less) only go up, I would invest a lot more - especially before this halving. The more halvings the currency goes through, the less influence each halving will have on the price of bitcoin.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-03-15 00:10:27
One of the most upvoted comments in the thread discussing the bug was by someone saying that Core is to blame for the exploit in BU, because they have made the code so difficult for others to work with... I mean, seriously!? These people have no humility or shame.
It's becoming apparent at this point that many of the BU supporters are clinically deranged. They will twist any event or (mis)quote to fit into their "BlockstreamCore is evil" narrative.
Fortunately the events that cause these kind of paranoid episodes to flare up ought to be enough to convince reasonable people that BU is not a serious player in the bitcoin development world, and is only attractive to conspiracy theorists and trolls.

I wasn't assuming BU would have value, but what with Trump, Brexit, and everything I've seen on twitter from BU &amp; Co. I'll admit I'm not as confident making predictions as I was a year ago.
Now that it's become evident that a disproportionally small and misrepresentative faction of the community can significantly disrupt progress, there's a part of me that thinks a split could be very beneficial for Bitcoin in the long-term, providing it happens relatively soon and the market rejects BTU (or it gets hacked to pieces).
edit: clarification
@_date: 2017-03-24 10:55:33
Not by miners, but if there is any value stored on the BU chain then any bad actor who knows of a critical bug will hack it to death. I imagine BU and it's proponents have made a lot ideological enemies who would do this out of principles, and there are others who would wait until BTU was listed on an exchange so they could short it and make a monetary gain.
@_date: 2017-03-28 19:30:29

Actually, while I'm worried about a fork setting us back a year or so, I have no doubt Core will still be leading Bitcoin development for years to come. Apart from Roger and Wu and a few others pumping it, BTU is dead on arrival.
I just posted this because nothing would give me more pleasure than to see Satoshi categorically give BTU the middle finger.

AFAICT this is purely about ego and saving face for Even if, after all the attempts people, including yourself, have made to help him see reason he understood that BU was a bad idea, he would still go along with it because it's too shameful for an intellectually dishonest person to admit they were wrong. He is not a big voice in the community because he's smart or brilliant, but because he got in early - which says nothing about his understanding of bitcoin.
edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-03-15 16:29:57
Yeah no one knows. However no one knows how far the fees would drop. After all while fees per tx would drop, miners would be fitting more tx into a block so that would also go some way to balancing it out.
The best way to learn what would happen is to run a test - which is what Charlie Lee is trying to do by encouraging SegWit to be adopted on Litecoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:59:27
I seriously hope Bitmain gets burned to fuck after the fork, and everyone boycotts them and discredits them online. Bitcoin was designed to survive the influence of selfish cunts, but that doesn't mean a fork won't hurt, and I'm praying it hurts Jihan and Roger the most.

Presumably the PoW change would be a one-off event to prevent Bitmain attacking the Core chain after a split. It wouldn't make their hardware obsolete if there was a viable way to make money using it to mine BTU, it would just make it obsolete as a weapon to interfere with other currencies.

* 1. The miners side of the deal was to run Core clients while the HF proposal was being written. They broke their commitment shortly after the agreement was made thereby voiding it.

I tend to agree with you. The majority don't even realise they're losing wealth through central bank initiatives like QE, which would probably be more disconcerting to them than issues with privacy, for better or worse.
That's why I think it's unlikely bitcoin will ever reach mass adoption in the way many here seem to think it will. Outside of an easily comprehensible use case like a store of wealth, it will have to make itself so uniquely usable or convenient (in a way that fiat can't be) that it becomes impossible to ignore. Remittance apps like Abra come to mind, and all the as-yet not conceived use cases micropayments will enable come to mind.
That's not to say bitcoin can't be made inherently private. I think most people want that after seeing what happened to the web. Making bitcoin private by default with the option for the user to reveal more information about themselves at their discretion would be ideal.

Looks like talk of a UASF is putting pressure on Bitmain. All this could be avoided if Antpool just signalled for SegWit, demand for which is becoming clearer every day. This not a warning about the potential of a network split resulting from a UASF, but more likely a threat that Antpool will intentionally cause disruption if the decision is taken out of their hands.

I haven't seen much that suggests there is more than one end goal for bitcoin in anyones eyes. What seems to divide people is what they're willing to sacrifice in order to get there. I'm not sure how much being smart or dumb has to do with which side people are drawn towards (I used to think Core should just bump the blocksize too), but think Core's efforts attract people who are generally more open minded and curious than BU's.

I believe it will be good for bitcoin in the long-term because it will act as a cautionary tale as to what happens when a small self-interested group of people attempt to take control of the ecosystem. It will also finally rid us of who won't have a shred of credibility to his name after this, and will also put pressure on Bitmain to shape up.
However, in the short-term we're going to see a lot of price volatility (downwards), a tonne of "bitcoin is dead" articles, and worst case scenario it will call into question bitcoin's value proposition as digital gold. I would rather it didn't come to this, but there's no stopping Ver or Wu if this is how they want to go down in history. Looking back it may be a good test of bitcoin's anti-fragile property.

That statement is incompatible with what many would see as a long-term interest in Bitcoin's future. Truth is, Bitcoin simply isn't great for what you need it for at this moment in time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:05:05
I don't think people are framing it as though it's no big deal for a currency. Volatility is a necessary right of passage bitcoin has to make before it can mature to currency status, but what *was* impressive was how resilient the price (for a store of value) was to the news.
@_date: 2016-03-26 13:35:26
It's exciting to think of the possibilities (we're talking life changing amounts of money for those invested), but there's been a lot of these kinds of posts over the last few months and we're still waiting for them to play out.

How do you quantify what would have community consensus?
Could Core not code this option and deploy it as one option, along with SWSF, which required 95% hashrate and X% node upgrades to activate?
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:09:38
You can lead a horse...
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:08:32


This is bullshit. Core would adopt any code from anyone if it was better than whatever they were working on. It's no coincidence that so few developers *outside* of Core are unimpressed with BU.
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:08:54
Problem is, hard forking is a freedom allowed to anyone with enough money and influence. Seems apparent by this point that Wu and Ver are determined to split bitcoin in two - how can you stop stupid people from doing stupid things?
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:35:49
I agree, I don't think BU would be around for long. It's hard to identify any genuine support for it on its own merits, so AFAICT its lifespan would depend entirely on how much money Roger and Jihan are willing to burn to keep up some semblance of vitality.


Unfortunately it seems that the community is already split, although how big each camp actually is is hard to tell. The trolls are just part of the Bitcoin ecosystem now.
@_date: 2017-02-02 08:56:49
There's also the option of users putting pressure on the pools, either through direct communication or by selling their holdings. For that to happen though it needs to be talked about, and recognised as a serious threat.
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:32:22
Does that mean those running 0.13.1 nodes wouldn't have to do anything in the event of a USAF, or would they be required to make a further upgrade before activation?
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:23:06
Thanks for the info, but do you not see how those tutorials describe methods that feel prohibitive for lots of users? Lots of steps and lots of opportunities to make mistakes.

I'm surprised that a mining unit manufacturer monopoly even exists. I thought things got reverse-engineered all the time in China.
Anyway, is it not possible that the threat of a PoW change would encourage other miners to turn on Antpool and orphan their blocks, if they didn't also concede?
Edit: missing word
@_date: 2017-03-04 09:38:34
I try to do that too, even though it feels futile when you see the kind of threats and misinformation Jihan and Roger post on twitter.
It's unfortunate that running a node with a hardware wallet is so inaccessible. 
Would a UASF not count as a voting opportunity?

I think it's to do with the unfamiliarity of what's being asked. For example...


I know what a .conf file is and how to open one, but this sentence (which is the first step) would be enough to stump half of my friends, who are in their early 30's and have grown up with computers.
I'm not complaining, and I'm glad you posted the links as they may be useful for other people. Was just pointing out that until a full node is as easy to setup as say, Microsoft Word, Bitcoin will be missing out on nodes that many would like to be able to run but can't.

Good to see such careful consideration has gone into making one of the biggest blunders in Bitcoin history. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:08:42
The uncertainty around the future of Bitcoin is the worst part of this botched movement from the BU camp. I would wager that a fork itself would cause less damage than the FUD around it has done.
Are Bitmain going to go ahead with their threat and fork? If so, when?
Are they just bluffing until a UASF makes it no longer possible to deny the community what they want?
Will the idea of a UASF catch on enough to make it live?
So exhausting. However, I agree that a sticky allowing for a more extensive discussion around the UASF would be useful.

I don't have the technical skill to set this up as I use a trezor. However I would like to run a pruned node anyway as a way to "vote" for SegWit - is this a bad idea in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:57:03
Such a damning review of the code put out by the guys at BU. The whole thing is a farce, and would be amusing if there wasn't so much at stake.
@_date: 2017-03-29 10:20:39
I also pointed that out in my comment. Essentially the big increase in BU nodes ought to start somewhere in the middle of the graph if I could have adjusted for it.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:43:44
I shouldn't have spoken for others then. My point was, personally, I don't think it's a big deal considering bitcoin hasn't even had its 10th birthday yet and the same news 3 years ago would have had double the impact on the price. It's progress.
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:01:29
This is what gets me most about BU and their supporters.
They get caught with their pants down, and instead of having the humility to say - "look, we fucked up, we'll do what we can to fix it and review our testing and peer review process" - they lie, and bullshit, and make exaggerated claims about how good they are. In what world does this kind of behaviour garner trust - and they are in the TRUST business!? It beggars belief. Even if you like the idea of what BU are doing, even if you hate Core, the actions of the BU devs should really make you question their personal integrity.
@_date: 2017-03-01 15:17:36


For the thousandth time - CORE ≠ r/bitcoin. **They do not have the ability to censor discussion.**

BU is dead to everyone except Roger Ver and Jihan Wu, but together they still have enough resources and influence to bring about a fork. That alone is enough to highlight the problems of centralization in bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-24 15:49:39
I disagree, after all bitcoin has a growth problem in as much as it's growing faster than the network can keep up with (while keeping the low fees and fast tx people expect). Things change quickly, but 'quickly' in most peoples eyes probably means weeks or months, whereas we should be framing these developments in years.

I know this might be a question you have good reasons not to answer, but how do you see a BU chain split playing out? Hard to tell at this point if Roger and Co are just posturing, but it seems to me at least that they've done too far to back down now.
If that was too contentious... on a more technical note: how will BU actually activate? I haven't seen anything about a grace period or activation date... is it just whenever Jihan decides it's time, without warning?

The first two blocks I looked at about half of all transactions were over $100, but this is just anecdotal. I'm sure there's hard data on this somewhere.
Besides, it doesn't change the fact that linear scaling will not help you and the "billion others" to buy coffee with transaction fees that you'll be comfortable with. BU is a dead end, and supporting it let alone forking it is so short-sighted. Bitcoin gets one shot, and speaking for myself I would rather not squander that on untested code from anonymously paid devs.
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:01:24

@_date: 2017-03-16 11:13:51
I agree with the sentiment of the blog, but thought the final plea was kind of at odds with the reality of the situation we're in.


My understanding is that with two "competing" development camps, bitcoin protocol upgrades have become something of a zero sum game. It has been made to feel like we can have *either* SegWit and LN *or* BU. This isn't the case, but the fact is if one side can't convince the other to support their work, it may as well be. That effectively makes both roadmaps incompatible, which then means the community who likes to feel engaged in development is compelled to take sides, or watch as upgrades grind to a crawl.
Having taken a side, I have a hard time looking in the mirror and telling how biased I've become, especially after reading posts from those who seem to be more forgiving, like Brian, Andreas and Jameson Lopp. I'll read a sentence like...


... and wonder why he is giving them (BU) the benefit of the doubt? I can't tell if it's politeness, good sportsmanship, or if he genuinely believes BU is adding something of value to the ecosystem. If it's the latter then I feel certain I'm biased, but I don't know to what degree, and I like to think that I'll go wherever the truth takes me. So far that has lead me to believe that the work being done by Core is currently the only viable path forwards if we want to see big improvements to bitcoin in the near-term future. The bugs alone in BU's code make it non-viable as is, and they have such a long way to go before they'll produce anything of real substance, if at all.


I would like to see examples of who Brian's talking about here. I haven't interpreted any criticism of BU's recent bug as an attempt at status elevating. Some have however rejoiced in the failure. I can empathise with that, and think it's understandable given that I personally perceive BU and its proponents as a threat to bitcoin. It comes from the thinking that if BU proves itself to be a total write-off that can't even be entertained as an alternative development proposal, we should expect to see upgrades like SegWit activate faster.
Speaking of which - we have a thoroughly tested and highly desirable upgrade in SegWit, which is near unanimously agreed upon by the development and business community around bitcoin as being necessary for other upgrades, and it's just sitting on the shelf. It could be activated a few weeks from now, studied in a live environment, learned from, built upon, (or not if users didn't want to use it!), and it wouldn't change anything for those who genuinely believe BU have something unique to bring to the table.
Oh fuck, I'm just tired of the seeming futility of discussion at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-08 18:14:03

@_date: 2017-03-22 18:58:23
Hashrate is a terrible metric to gauge community sentiment when 50% can be controlled by one company, and that company hangs their ASIC monopoly over the heads of its competition. 
That's the antithesis of consensus.
For a better overview of what the community wants look at what [users]( and [businesses]( are supporting. Not to mention the recent statement from exchanges.

@_date: 2017-03-20 00:35:43
It's possible, although I'd be tempted not to go there.
However, I do wonder how comfortably Bitcoin's ideology sits within Chinese culture. It's *purpose for existing* is to circumvent authoritarian behaviour and politics, which have historically gone hand in hand in China.
It reminds me of a documentary I saw a while ago about the elections in China, where they were interviewing young "modern" citizens to ask what they thought about vote fixing allegations. They weren't bothered about it. They either didn't value their democratic right or thought that the government knew best anyway. It was clear that generally speaking there was something of a subservient mindset still present, understandably a hangover of their recent political past. I might be reading too much into what was just a glimpse into that world, but I am curious as to whether this is relevant to what's going on currently in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:02:27
Compelling arguments, and while I'm not privy to how you determine things such as what is legitimate use of blockchain and what isn't, I follow your reasoning.


Speaking for myself, the reason I don't run a node is because to use it with a Trezor seems to require an above-average level of computer literacy. As I've never run one I don't know how much the bandwidth would be an issue personally, but then I'm fortunate enough to live somewhere where there essentially are no data caps on internet packages. If setting up a node with any hardware/software wallet took two or three clicks I'd expect node count to increase non-trivially.


This is one thing that I struggle to wrap my head around. As the Bitcoin user base continues to grow (in some cases with people using bitcoin without realising it, Abra), how can we know exactly what the community supports? Polls are useful, engaging on social media can be useful, talking to businesses and miners can be useful, but what concrete metrics do we have to decide whether a proposal has enough support to see the light of day or not?
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:09:33


You're aware that segwit includes a blocksize increase?
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:22:29
Although it's hard to tell from the outside *what* the state of communication is like between Core and miners... it seems it could be improved.
They should start a public fund to hire reliable translators to keep a conversation continually open. Greg for example is a really great communicator IMO, and if miners are reasonable enough I don't see why there shouldn't be a much better relationship between them and Core.

I agree with everything you say.
I'm relatively new to bitcoin, and everything I learned in the first couple of months of research came from r/bitcoin and r/btc. It's clear to me now that r/btc actually do a terrible job of representing Gavin. I was fully expecting him to be a massive, unreasonable douchebag based on the sentiment of all the posts made by people who behave as though they speak on his behalf. When I dug up some YouTube videos of him however, I was pleasantly surprised and relieved to see that he's nothing like the antagonist of core he's made out to be.
Obviously he doesn't agree on their roadmap for scaling bitcoin, but he comes across as quite calm and optimistic about the future of bitcoin, even supportive of anyone who is working in the space.
I imagine the redditors who are absolutely convinced that Blockstream is controlling everything core do, are the same types who think that 911 was an inside job, and the moon landing was staged in a TV studio. Conspiracy theories are these people's favorite toy, they aren't interested in rational conversation and probably believe changing one's mind is a sign of weakness.
We can't get rid of them, but hopefully they'll get drowned out as the community continues to grow (InB4 the "not gonna grow with a 1mb block size" comment).

If one of the components of the bitcoin ecosystem is centralised, as mining is, you don't need a majority of malicious actors to really fuck things up. You just need one malicious actor who has a disproportionate amount of influence. AFAICT that's exactly what Jihan Wu is.


Again, it can only do this effectively with a much more decentralised ecosystem than it currently has. I think the next year will see bitcoin either boom or bust.
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:00:38
Sounds exciting to a layman (me), but wonder what other developers make of it.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:06:47
I'm not actually convinced that a hardfork is a bad thing now. Bitcoin today has a serious centralisation in the form of Bitmain's monopoly on mining hardware. It would be undesirable even if they were good actors, but seeing as they evidently are not, it could be argued that Bitcoin needs to make an example of them (no doubt damaging itself and its image somewhat in the process). 
A hardfork could, among other things, act as a cautionary tale to prevent people from abusing their power in the future.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:07:30
If you care about the long term profitability of bitcoin, why do you not welcome an upgrade that increases tx/s as well as the utility of bitcoin through further upgrades that require it?
IMO it doesn't make sense to fear governance being dominated by Blockstream. Their employees make up less than 10% of Core contributors. Do you really think the other 90% would work on Core if it was just a vehicle to make Blockstream money? You should do some research into Blockstream if you're concerned - reach out to Greg or Adam. There's also no reason to be paranoid when the project is open source. You can see exactly what is being built, why it's being built and who wants to use it.
Finally AFAICT, it has never been the role of miners to control the direction of bitcoin anyway. You get rewarded for providing the network with security and that's it. Users and businesses built around bitcoin are the ones who decide what makes bitcoin valuable. The fact that some miners have decided not to signal for segwit even though a large number of users and business want to use it (which is entirely optional even when it's live!) shows this relationship has become confused.
I hope miners come to their senses, but with Antpool behaving badly it doesn't look like this will happen. I'm looking forward to the end of the stalemate, but it seems it will have to get uglier before it gets better.
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:24:07
Thanks for the translation OP. That was an enlightening read, and for me at least is the last nail in the coffin of BU.
Now that Jihan has come clean on his true motivations for blocking SegWit - one question remains...
Why do miners expect the market to be charitable towards them, when they have explicitly rejected Bitcoin innovations in order to boost their own profitability?
Miners should never be able to make profit *at the expense* of Bitcoins progress. I think talk of a PoW change was the reason for this uncharacteristically humble post from Jihan. They know that Bitcoin needs miners, but it doesn't need *institutional miners*, the likes of which they represent. Will be interesting to see how things develop from here.


Uncharacteristic because it wasn't written by him it turns out.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:59:40


Not sure whether or not this falls into Cores remit of work, but I'm prevented in running a node because I have no idea how to link it up to my Trezor and was told there's no point running one if I'm not using it to record my transactions. I've seen a couple of guides and they are way beyond my technical ability (even though they're step-by-step I don't feel confident using them when my savings are involved).

@_date: 2017-03-29 17:33:51
This. I actually think his behaviour, combined with the fact that ASIC production has wound up as a monopolised industry, is enough of a justification to force a PoW change.
There would be a lot of unfortunate collateral damage, but at the moment the precedent is being set that Bitcoin evolution can be hijacked by any well-funded and well-positioned entrepreneur.
Personally I'd rather pull the plaster off, burn the players who have been exploiting the community, and watch Bitcoin take off.

You're welcome. Thanks man!
@_date: 2016-01-20 23:10:03
Thanks for the advice, man. I originally bought £100 worth on coinfloor just to see if it was legit, then transferred it to my mycelium wallet to see if that worked, and everything seemed to go smoothly. So I bought some more and have left them in coinfloor for now, as I'm not sure how to sell via mycelium. There is a sell for cash option but that sounds so dodgy. I'm not sure I'll ever understand the implications of the forks, so I guess I'm happy to leave the majority in coinfloor for now. 
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:51:50
Sounds like a very wise decision to make given your situation.
Might also be very timely, as it seems a chain split this year is looking more and more likely. 
I've been trying to find out about BU's activation strategy in order to weigh up when would be a good time to sell, but no one seems to know anything about it. No grace period, no activation date, no notice... I can't believe industry leaders aren't coming out and actively confronting Antpool over this. Scary shit.

That doesn't mean that bitcoin will never scale. If/when it does, then the comparison will have proven to be good. 
I'm surprised that I've been downvoted so much in this thread. I can only presume it's because I'm coming up with ideas (and that's all they are, ideas) that people don't like the sound of. People can claim it's about ideology as much as they like, but personally I think they begrudge the fact they aren't getting rich as quickly as they thought they would.

Great video, and a lot of views/shares for something that was posted just a few days ago...
Dem comments tho.
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:13:37
You would imagine that has something to do with the price rise over the last year or so, but there are other factors that are influencing price - such as uncertainty about the global economic recovery, the devaluation of currencies such as the Chinese yuan, infighting amongst the bitcoin community and continued uncertainty surrounding the technology itself - if/how it will be regulated by governments.
It's tricky to know exactly what is affecting the value of bitcoin though, especially while much of the demand is coming from speculative investors rather than people who want to buy it for it's utility. In other words, while bitcoin itself is very predictable as you pointed out, human behaviour is not always so :P
I'm not an economist or an investor though, so I'm just picking up what I read on reddit and twitter (taking it all with a fistful of salt). Just thinking out loud.

I'm not that technical so I'll take your at your word, but I've heard Andreas make the comparison before that the protocol the internet runs on ran into many difficulties, but in time they were negotiated around.
I'm reminded of this every time there's a thread like this. Think how much more inconvenient bitcoin was to use a few years ago, and how much better the experience will be a few years from now.

I think there are a lot of people on both sides of the blocksize debate (those who lurk predominantly in r/bitcoin, and those in r/btc) who would be happy to find a new go-to forum for news and discussion which has none of the censorship and toxic character assassinations that exist in *both* subreddits. In other words, a place where adults can talk about one of the coolest innovations of the 21st Century.
Personally I hope that r/bitcoin can become this place, all it needs to do is open the doors again. If not, there's a space just waiting to be filled by anyone with the time and inclination.
@_date: 2016-06-08 23:02:32
Agreed. With all the shit-slinging that goes on in the bitcoin community, how many times have you seen an industry player admit their mistakes and apologise publicly?
I genuinely don't think the opinions Erik expresses are motivated by a desire to drive a wedge in the community. In fact, in the podcast the original post linked to he repeatedly called for everyone to be more reasonable and start building bridges to heal the community. His immediate response to the post going missing was a perfect example of how easy it can be to overreact amidst our own confusion, but his transparency in admitting a mistake and simply apologising sets an example the community would benefit from following.
There will always be vocal douchebags on reddit who feed off drama, and antagonise others to get a reaction and pump their epeen or whatever. But if the rest of us made more of an effort to chill, and not take it personally when others disagree, bitcoin would be stronger than it currently is.

Can't be a coincidence that Antpool's hash power dropped as BTC.TOP comes out of nowhere with 7.2% hash power, as of this post. Similar story with ViaBTC, which currently has 7.9% hash power. Included GBMiners (4.5%) and bitcoin.com (1.3%), although I'm less certain about these two being under Antpool's umbrella.
I see Bitmain/Antpool/Jihan as potentially the biggest threat to bitcoin in the short-medium term - mainly because of the way they play these kinds of games and keep their cards very close to their chest. That's probably normal behaviour for most businesses but where mining is concerned it could be very counterproductive. Just wondered how others weigh up this as a potential threat to bitcoin, and what are their motivations for behaving this way?
@_date: 2016-06-20 13:42:40
edit: not as stable as you make it sound. Also bitcoin has shown that it can be stable, but by definition in the short term it can't be if there is more money coming into it.

@_date: 2016-06-06 10:19:33
No one really knows, but in the short-term (0-6 months) some have speculated it'll cause the price to drop, because mining profitability will take a hit so some miners could go out of business (meaning longer block times and congestion until difficulty readjusts). In the long-term (6months+), if the demand for bitcoin continues to increase steadily it should cause the price to increase also, as new coins are entering the market at a slower pace than before.
That's just my understanding, anyway. I'm by no means an expert.
@_date: 2016-06-30 06:05:08
If there were a bitcoin ETF, would there be any benefit to holding actual bitcoin over owning the same amount in ETF, if you invested purely for speculative reasons?
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:16:05
The thing I don't understand is that if the bitcoin price were to reach some of the more spectacular predictions (let's say $100,000 per coin), how is that ever going to be achieved while remaining stable? And if it doesn't display stability, will it ever be able to hit those highs?
My understanding of economics is rudimentary, but this feels a little chicken/egg to me, and I can't get my head around it. In other words, I'm curious how a price increase of 200x would look over the course of say, 10 years. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:56:11

Whether or not an exchange is good is one thing, but you should never store bitcoin on one. An exchange is a business, and if that business goes bust you could potentially lose all your bitcoin. The safest place to put your bitcoin is in a hardware wallet.

It's human nature really. Imagine listing the average persons daily concerns. While their financial situation is definitely up there, the currency they use is probably not even on the list. 
This is why mainstream bitcoin adoption by consumers may take a while, especially in The West. I think Western consumers who are used to having their financial products protected (not many people misplace their bank account and lose all their savings), wouldn't even consider storing all their money in bitcoin until it's backed by an institution.

I'm not sure how Rootstock, Ethereum and Bitcoin will interact with each other, but the first thing that's worth pointing out is that Ethereum isn't doomed.

Does it matter how long the comparison has been made if it holds true? The reality, however undesirable, might just be that it takes a long time for a technology like bitcoin to become more mainstream. Sure we should provide constructive criticism and push for improvements, but if implementing that takes time we'll just have to suck it up.

You're letting your anger with the establishment get in the way. Yes, bitcoin can be used whether the government says so or not. But not everybody thinks like you do. The majority of the general public need big institutions to say that bitcoin is legit, before they feel comfortable using it. Whether or not you care how governments view bitcoin depends on whether or not you care if bitcoin gets adopted quickly or not.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:11:31


That's fair enough. Fortunately there are X number of people who have however many trillions of dollars invested in gold, and who may syphon some of that into bitcoin.


I've often wondered what it would look like to see bitcoin go from $300 to $30,000 for example, over the space of 10 years. Who knows if that would be slow and steady or continue to be volatile :o
@_date: 2017-01-08 10:25:06
Is the idea that it would be adopted by wallets and used by default e every time a transaction is made, or would you just use it once and your coins' history is sufficiently scrambled, or something else?

@_date: 2016-06-15 09:35:03
Passive aggressive much.
I'm not going to argue, but I did want to add that I agree with your last point. Mass adoption for using bitcoin as a store of wealth will never happen without some kind of insurance or consumer protection either - most people prefer the "security" of their bank, where they're covered for fraud, theft and potentially backed by the government in the case of a banks failure.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:29:52

It's not ideal (easier for a single government to cause significant disruption to mining community), but in a world where miners were acting in the best interests of bitcoin it wouldn't be so big a problem. Personally I don't feel like we live in that world, so it's very unfortunate indeed.

I don't know what the source of OP's content is, but this part makes me think (hope) it did not come from a consortium of miners. 
Why? Because from what I understand only a small number of core developers signed the HK agreement, and were supposedly explicit in stating they did so in their capacity as individual developers. In other words there was no consensus from "Core" to follow the HK agreement. 
I find it hard to believe this got lost in translation, so I doubt miners would react with this kind of behaviour. Will be interesting to see how this pans out, but I hope there's no serious (further) fallout.

I don't think your capital will appreciate by turning bitcoin into Antcoin, but you *will* be able to buy a pizza for 10,000 bitcoin and get your transaction confirmed in the next block with zero fees if that scenario plays out. Just like the good old days.

Not to mention that SegWit provides an *actual* blocksize increase, added as a compromise for those wanting immediate on-chain scaling relief.

But the difference between the conduct of the average redditor in each sub is stark. Some have said it's due to frustration over the moderation policy here, but that narrative is wearing thin as the months roll on.
There is also a lot of alt-coin pushing that goes on over there, not that there's anything wrong with that per se, but it seems to be done to spite bitcoin in it's current state.
While it's true there's propaganda in both subs, anyone can see the difference in the focus of the posts in general - the topics in r/btc are waaay more politicised, and the language used is clearly designed to pull on peoples emotions.

Hard to tell how many of them are anti-bitcoin, and how many of them are just wrong, or misinformed.
I used to split my time between r/btc and r/bitcoin a month or so after discovering bitcoin, and at one point thought a 2mb HF was the best course of action for bitcoin scaling (bought the FUD). 
Regardless of the impact they seem to have on the public discourse around things like scaling, the community there push out anyone who is reasonable and curious given enough time. I ended up getting a post limit put on my account due to all the down votes I received, which was the final nail in the coffin for me. Pre-post limit it was a chore to take part in the discussions there, so after the limit was imposed I just gave up commenting anymore - it wasn't worth it without the opportunity to push back against some of the full-time antagonists. 
There's not much to be done about the sub though, it's their right to do what they do. Doesn't make it productive, commendable or moral. If you want you could always provide counter arguments to the crap that gets peddled there. Take a leaf out of u/nullc's book, who spends a lot of energy calling people out on their bullshit. It seems to fall on (intentionally?) deaf ears most of the time, but I'm sure it gets through to some, myself included.

Have you seen some of the bullshit that gets posted here? Being knowledgeable has nothing to do with it.


Now you're just being dramatic, and lying. I've previously criticised the censorship on this sub and was entirely left alone, so that can't be the only factor.


Solving what problem? Moderation is necessary but it's not always easy to see where to draw the line. For example, many of the accounts which get banned are clearly set up to spread misinformation and encourage infighting. And if you *genuinely* want a moderation free sub to discuss bitcoin, I'd look elsewhere than r/btc. I currently have a post limit imposed on my account there, making it very hard to stay involved in a conversation. Wouldn't surprise me if there are more sinister examples too.

I agree that this halving isn't comparable to the last. However, I read in an interview with one of the big miners (apologies - I can't remember who), that most miners are long on bitcoin. So even if the halving sees the exit of miners who have been badly financially managed, which seems probable, the rest will hold out at least as long as it takes for the difficulty to readjust to see where the price of btc sits.

To be fair, I think that's just reddit. 
IMHO bitcoin is already being used in the real world effectively. It might not have acquired mainstream adoption yet, but mainstream adoption is only a measure of success depending on the use case you're looking at, and it seems there are a few core use cases for bitcoin. Taking the example of the micropayment use case, this could reach mainstream adoption without users even realising they're using bitcoin (as this could work in conjunction with fiat). 
The level of innovation shouldn't be judged by the extremes of circle-jerk and FUD that are visible on here.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:21:11

Firstly, SegWit gives us on-chain scaling.


If there's no consensus on SegWit SF in 2017, there won't be consensus for a blocksize increase by HF (more contentious).


Core has a huge team of multidisciplinary developers with a long history and track record in crypto and open source development. You would rather trade that for a tiny team of anonymously funded devs who politicise development at every turn... and you're worried about monopolies? Ok.
Under BU the blocksize would not be b chosen by "the people". It would be chosen by the miners, who have every incentive to make them as big as possible, to the detriment of "the people" running their own nodes.

Is this due to the difficulty change? With the surge in hashpower going online over the last couple weeks, I'm guessing blocks were being solved &lt;10 mins average. Now that the blocks are being solved more slowly the transactions are stacking up.
If this bothers you, just send a brief polite email to the bigger mining pools asking for them to activate segwit.

Bitcoin events typically get pretty wild, do they? Spill the beans :P
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:14:50
I'm confused about this too. 
My best guess is that with every passing day, the legitimacy of bitcoin in the public eye as a safe storage of value improves, and since the global financial markets are very nervous about the state of the economy at the moment, more money is flooding into btc. If the news broke tomorrow saying everything in the global economy is hunky dory, I think we would see a drop of a couple hundred dollars. Some of the recent price increase is probably also due to the halving, but I don't think this is everyday-usage-adoption-fuelled rocket time just yet.
Would be interesting to know what others are reading into recent events.

Just because you're paying relatively high fees today, doesn't mean it's always going to be that way, or get worse.
Core's roadmap is playing out, despite some resistance from anti-bitcoiners, and if in 2017 we see segwit activate and lightning reach consumers you can expect to see some big changes in fees this year or the next. Rome wasn't built in a day.

Because trust in politicians is at an all time high in 2017...
Edit: couple of points in the article that stood out for me for being misleading:
**On SegWit...**


"[The market]( by which I mean the majority of people building infrastructure on top of bitcoin (adding value), appear to be vastly in favour of SegWit going live. "The market" you seem to be referring to is a small number of disproportionately powerful miners who AFAICT would rather take one marshmallow now than two further down the road.
**On a blocksize increase...**


As a compromise to those very demands of the miners, an on-chain scaling bump was included with SegWit. That ought to explain the frustration felt over why some miners now appear reluctant to activate it.
**On certainty...**


You seem to be asking a lot from your readers to just take you at your word here. Reasonable people don't talk this way.
**On transaction fees and pricing out new adoption...**


There aren't many people who would make a statement like that in a room full of intelligent bitcoiners. The suggestion that microtransactions are only viable as on-chain transactions is ridiculous. I've seen you say before that you think LN is vapourware, so it doesn't surprise me that you would be taken in by this, but to go on and say that bitcoin has lost two billion users as a result of relatively high tx fees is pure short-sighted FUD.

Thanks u/bitfury_group! Can't speak for all users but it means a lot to me :)
Edit: I don't know if it's just due to geographical and language barriers, but miners in China seem to be less open in communicating whether or not they intend to support segwit. Does anyone know if there are any other big pools who have expressed their plans to implement it?
Edit2: Have miners based in China historically been slower to uptake BIPs, than those elsewhere?
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:41:56
+1 for SegWit.
I don't understand the technology that drives bitcoin, so I have to defer judgement on why SegWit is a good idea. But all the voices in the community that I respect, and who appear honest and knowledgable believe SegWit is an important update that will fix malleability, enable more TPS, and open doors for new and exciting developments. Good enough for me.

The Hong Kong agreement has often been used by big-blockers as an example of Core stalling trying to buy time. I don't believe that's true, but I am curious how clear the situation as you've described it was to the miners.
Everyone seems to have a different interpretation of what the agreement meant and who broke it. It's like the ecosystem needs a dedicated communications team to bridge the gap between miners and developers.

If a Zero Hedge article can knock the value of bitcoin down 5% in a few hours then that's worrying.

Interesting idea, and one worth some attention as a contingency plan.
The concerns I can see are:
How much it would damage trust in the currency (would it still be called bitcoin even?). I imagine we would definitely see sub $100 prices.
Who would be willing to invest in and develop mining equipment for a currency that has previously expelled its miners?
Would the best developers feel inclined to work on this, after bitcoin essentially failed? I think so, but who knows.
Would users and businesses move with the currency?
There are probably many other concerns here. Even rumors of developers spending time on this could shake bitcoin's economy. But I do agree that miners seem to be suffering a misconception of their role in the ecosystem, and we should plan for every outcome.
@_date: 2016-11-26 11:28:31

That's worrying to hear. I'm far more concerned about mining than scaling to be honest, at least scaling issues are somewhat predictable.
Do you think mining distribution will find a better balance in the future through competition?
Would having an equivalent of the W3C to set industry standards for mining be a good thing?
Do you think mining will enter an institutional phase, and would this be a good thing or a bad thing?

Looks like you're trying to attribute views to me that I don't actually hold. Why not just speak straight?
Can you point me to where I suggested SegWit was the only option on the table? I believe it's the best option available at this time, but clearly I don't believe it should be rammed down peoples throats if they don't want it - as I asked at the bottom of my post I don't understand *why* some miners seem apprehensive or actively against SW adoption. 
@_date: 2016-11-19 16:18:57
Jihan Wu seems to be sympathetic to Roger's cause, and Bitmain had some guy present at their recent conference saying things like *if the block size were 100x bigger miners would get 100x the rewards*.
I think there are influential players who are against segwit and want to see bigger blocks first, but they are very in number.

I know that in r/btc priority is given to the upvote/downvote button, because the comments by themselves are so vacuous. They're all about the theatrics over there.
Edit: judging by the 30 day account, and your comment history, the feigning ignorance... you're a much more likely candidate for being a troll than @_date: 2016-11-03 09:27:51
FWIW from Bitmains marketing department...


@_date: 2016-11-04 19:10:13


Obviously not. I was talking about the events themselves not their repercussions. Events that cause the price to drop are particularly unpredictable.
To make the most of those situations you need to be:
a) online at all times
b) happy to keep fiat/bitcoin on an exchange
Neither apply to me, so I just hold.
@_date: 2016-11-21 22:52:18


Where is it then?
@_date: 2016-11-17 15:41:16
Seriously hoping SegWit voting doesn't turn into bitcoins Trump event.
I'm convinced for big blockers this is more about pride than it is about progress. If sentiment in rbtc is mirrored by a significant proportion of the mining community, nothing Core ever produces will get adopted, because nothing can be said to convince big-blockers of the validity of their roadmap.
I really hope I'm wrong, but I'm predicting a stalemate.
@_date: 2016-11-17 08:31:52


Not true. I've had my account capped to one comment every 10 minutes in rbtc.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:20:04
Fees aren't the only thing that set bitcoin apart from the alternatives. Relatively speaking they aren't even that important in the short-term, as we know developments are in the pipeline to bring back zero-conf low-fee transactions without sacrificing bitcoin's decentralization.
edit: typo
@_date: 2017-01-23 08:24:39
Am I the only one who doesn't necessarily see this as a good thing? I feel like Bitmain/Antpool and the influence they have over the relatively insular mining community are one of the biggest threats to bitcoin, given their political views. The fact so much mining power is springing up out of nowhere makes me worry they're making moves to extend their power.
@_date: 2016-11-01 14:08:16
Well I'm none the wiser for your reply.

I honestly believe rbtc is more interested in seeing Blockstream and Core die than they are in seeing bitcoin succeed.

As far as Andreas is concerned; bitcoin would be lucky to have 100 more of him.

You might be right, but it seemed strange because I'm certain I've posted more replies in a row than that before.
If I'm wrong I'll apologise.
Edit: and I wasn't blaming Roger directly, I was pointing out the hypocrisy that moderation exists in both subs.
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:37:42
From a business perspective, sure.
However, so does everyone else who thinks bitcoin is stronger the less centralized it is.
To be fair to Bitmain, they have stated that they will only own a minority of the facility, so it's unlikely 75% of bitcoins hashrate will end up existing in a square mile. The rest will be used by other miners mining whatever they want. It's anyones guess how honest they are, though.

@_date: 2016-11-30 13:24:39
For one thing it's irritating to listen to someone shout for any length of time, and more often than not the person who's shouting is less trustworthy. The reason most people lose their cool, or even resort to theatrics when they're trying to argue a point is because they're wrong, and they're appealing to peoples emotions (in a broadcasted conversation, anyway).
Like I said, I actually agreed with the guys yelling, just saying they're not doing themselves any favours being like that.
@_date: 2016-11-02 14:16:33

I get why people don't like those kinds of comments though - there's so much garbage analysis out there... people making financial forecasts with Spirographs and such.
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:12:12
I agree, but I have a feeling bitsko only wants to see this model adopted by the pools currently signalling for segwit.
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:24:51

Pretty good odds in that case.

That's exactly why I go there.

Ironically there is such a thing as an inverted head and shoulders pattern, which Raoul Pal suggested is what we could see play out if bitcoin goes past $800. It's just a prediction, but I like the guy, he has that rare combination of being successful and being modest.

You literally stated this as my opinion, then alluded to the fact I thought this was a bad thing. I was just clarifying my point for you.
@_date: 2016-11-28 12:17:01

You could help yourself by explaining the situation calmly. More likely to get a reasonable response.
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:49:01
Please don't go dark Greg :p
I understand why you would want to. It must be so frustrating to spend the kind of energy you do pushing back against the tidal waves of political bullshit in the community. Energy which could be spent doing real work. It's a huge opportunity cost. 
Speaking for myself though, I don't think that energy is *wasted*. When I first came to bitcoin at the beginning of this year I didn't know what to make of the blocksize debate. I found myself leaning towards the 2mb increase being pushed by classic, because it was easier to understand, and I bought into the FUD that without a capacity increase bitcoin would "die". I kept reading however, and visiting both subs as I still do, and would like to think that reason came through - in large part due to the conversations you were involved in. I'm fully convinced that Core are bitcoins best hope at seeing its potential reached.
How you manage to keep your cool is beyond me, and it's a real shame that there aren't more people willing to take up the task of correcting poor technical understanding or refuting the lies that get spread around. It's a shame that it's necessary in the first place, but that's life.
It doesn't get said enough, but bitcoin needs people like you. Most of the positive effects of the work you and the other Core contributors do probably can't be measured in any real sense. I hope you find some comfort in that fact, and continue to do the good work.

"I HAVE NO IDEA IF GLOBAL WARMING IS BEING CAUSED BY HUMANKIND" - Roger Ver, 2016
This podcast is a goldmine for Roger's detractors, but fuck me. If this sums up his understanding and respect for science, it's no wonder he's making the noises he is.

Seems to be for some! Doesn't hurt to repeat it.
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:44:34
It's not all good. It also means that bitcoin won't reach it's full technological potential, or at least not in the ways we expect, or as quickly.

The answer ought to be you will slightly less bitcoin but they will become more valuable in the future as a result.
@_date: 2016-11-30 09:03:04
Entire movement? It's just one person.
Either way, I really don't understand why this guy is something of a name in the bitcoin community. He admits to having limited technical knowledge of how bitcoin works and his background is in film making, so why he throws his weight around in complicated development topics I don't know. It's commendable to try and learn more, and kudos to him for going into the chat when he must have known he was going to get some flak. However, having such strong conviction on technical matters (that sound like they're beyond him) and then using his platform to spread them seems dishonest to me.
If I had come to this conversation knowing nothing about bitcoin, unfortunately I would be more attracted by Olivier's position after listening, simply because of the way the other guests chat were behaving. I know it's frustrating for people to sit and listen to someone talk confidently about things they don't understand, but it's really nauseating when people start raising their voice.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:19:26


The thing I'm sceptical about here is how this would help signalling for BIPs. Let's say a business starts selling a water heater that pays for itself. Are users really going to think about what mining pool their boiler is running on (if they even give a shit about mining politics, or are aware that signalling is even a thing)?
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:54:25
This. It's impossible to speculate. What we *do* know however, is that bitcoin has been the most successful currency in the world for economic growth this year.
@_date: 2016-11-21 19:25:31
Great post. I've been following this guy on Twitter and he has a lot of sensible things to say.
The point about businesses freeloading is an interesting one, and one that I'd be interested to hear opinion on (as you often back your arguments for bigger blocks with examples of such businesses, Roger).
The fact of the matter is; what's best for bitcoin may well be detrimental to *some* of the businesses currently built on it. In a rational world that's not a reason to impede the development of the protocol itself. 
Edit: I'm not saying what I think is best for bitcoin here, just pointing out the reality of the situation we're in.
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:34:49

FYI they aren't voting to leave the Euro, they're voting on a proposal to overhaul their political system, which is currently very inefficient at passing new laws. Their current PM has said he'll step down if the country votes no to the change, which may open the door for an Italian exit, but the title here is too suggestive that this is what's being voted on.

I've seen a couple of tweets from Brian that seemed to come across as very entitled, as though bitcoin exists to serve OB. I'm not saying he doesn't have legit concerns, but as I've said before - it might be an unpleasant truth that what is best for bitcoin, is bad for some of the businesses currently built on top of it (but will allow for many more in the end).

I like the climate change analogy. The science is clear as day to the scientists and those perceptive enough to pay attention, but there are plenty of people who just want the world to stay as it is, because it requires less effort to understand.

In this case I think yes, because presumably they lost some of their hash rate after some miners redirected their resources to different pools. It depends where these resources were redirected though. Either way it's not too much of a concern.


All the hash rate adds up to 100%, but these guys only lost 30% of their *share*, which at it's height made up about 9% of the total hash rate of the network... so now they're down to around 6%.
You can see all the different pools here

Most people in this sub wouldn't, but there's a whole world of old money that don't feel comfortable buying and holding bitcoin. If an ETF provides a bridge for some of that money, surely that's a good thing for bitcoin? If nothing else it'll improve its reputation (outside of reddit).

Trump is a *catastrophe* waiting to happen. Every other thing that comes out of his mouth would be enough to shame any other presidential candidate in US history into resigning. It's an absolute scandal that he's even in with a chance. He's a poorly informed, lying, scamming, petty, bullying, misogynistic, bigoted imbecile who has no respect for political process and could destabilise the global political scene.

It isn't one person. But Roger is one of the more vocal, influential, and accessible people holding segwit back.
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:37:38
Fair enough, "productive" is a relative term to some extent. But if bitcoin turns out to provide the world with a valuable service (which if you ask Venezualans, Chinese and Indians it already has), then you could argue Stolfi's public deriding of bitcoin is objectively harmful to society. Ironically, Roger Ver ought to believe this hero of rbtc is essentially committing genocide with the comments he's making on the SEC.
I spend a lot of time being unproductive (right now, for example), but I'm not harming anyone in the process.
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:45:06

@_date: 2016-11-03 08:55:50
It's understandable why you would do that, but the whole point of dollar cost averaging is that when you pull your money out, the final value reflects the average trend of the asset. You might lose a small % of profit if you buy just before a dip, but if bitcoin does ever go moon it would cancel those losses out and then some.
@_date: 2016-11-28 10:44:47
I don't think that would be as effective. If you listen to Roger talk he's more like an evangelist preacher - using volume and repetition to get a message across (which can be very effective against an opposition who actually has to think about what they're saying). 
Pretty sure Andreas would be better at stamping out Roger's bullshit.
@_date: 2016-11-24 20:07:40
Frustrating to see so many people confuse centralization with organisation, ie. those who think Core is the weakest point of centralization because they operate under one name. Core have been explicit in stating that all they can do is provide suggestions to improve bitcoin in the form of code. No one is obliged to adopt their work. 
It feels like there's an element of East vs West going on too, as opposed to us all being on the same team. The more decentralized mining becomes the less politically contentious changes to the protocol will be, as people will be forced to scrutinise the code on its technical and economic merits alone.
@_date: 2016-11-28 23:37:59
From what he said it sounds like he's just a normal guy. A film maker, I think he said, he was a bit vague on what his background is. Admitted to not being especially clued up on bitcoin at a technical level.
FWIW I think he was a respectful guest on the chat, especially seeing as some of the guys on there were being particularly rude. I agreed with the points they were making, and TBH am not really sure why Olivier has as much of a voice in the community as he does, but still.

Why do people think it'll take a year, when a not insignificant portion of the ecosystem is already poised to take advantage of SegWit?
Also IIRC there are only 5 or so wallets that would need to upgrade to cover 80% of on chain transactions, some of which have already signalled their interest in upgrading.
@_date: 2016-11-20 14:54:42
I'm aware that with the subs I visit and the people I follow on twitter I've created a bit of an echo chamber for myself, but still got the impression that SegWit is considered by the vast majority of the community as a good thing. A no-brainer, so to speak. [60+ bitcoin businesses and infrastructure companies behind the project]( 1/3 of which are segwit-ready, 1/3 of which are working towards being so.
So why not just implement it now, make the most of the scaling benefits it *does* offer, allow the broader community to continue developing the tech and businesses that rely on it, and continue calling for bigger blocks if they still want them? It seems like a win across the board, so if a mining pool does want to stop it going live, what's they're reasoning?

I liked the bit where a couple of people (20% of the audience) asked questions and Roger goes off on a completely random tangent.
Edit: Just flicked through bits of each of their talks... seriously these guys do not sound all that intelligent or convincing. If they genuinely had something to offer bitcoin they wouldn't spend so much time deriding the work Core has done. I find it hard to believe that even ViaBTC would want to touch Unlimited.
@_date: 2016-12-01 11:27:24

They apparently hold [1m bitcoin]( With the current price of bitcoin at $900, a Coinbase hack would be twice as bad as Gox in USD terms. Regardless of how good their security is it would be better for everyone if there was a smaller bounty for hackers.
Anyone who is storing bitcoin on Coinbase who is not an active trader should move their holdings to a hardware wallet like trezor, or if it's a small amount to a software wallet like mycelium.

How do we even know who's on the fence? Miners seem to keep their cards close to their chest.
On another topic - apart from BTCC, which although based in China is owned by Bobby Lee (American?), it seems Western miners are more readily in favour of SegWit than Chinese miners. If that's the case, do you have an idea as to why this might be, and do you think more resources should be spent on improving communications between the two camps?

Unfortunately it sounds like he's not engaging with the points being made by the others, instead just waiting for his turn to read from his list of objections. He's just doubling down. If he comes out of this conversation with the exact same opinions as he had going into it, I doubt he's even open to the idea he could conceivably be wrong on the scaling issue.
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:46:02


You seem to think you're exposing some awful secret I've been harboring, that I don't think people should be able to trade freely.
Of course I think people should be able to trade freely, and it would be awesome if bitcoin transactions cost next to nothing. But I'm not a child who can't confront reality. Like I said, it **might be** an **unpleasant truth** that bitcoin's growing pains are shared by some businesses. Like the internet, which 5-10 years ago was much more expensive for a much poorer service than it is now, bitcoin may also become prohibitive for some business models in the short-term. I don't doubt, and am very hopeful that, in the long-term transactions will become much cheaper than they are now. 
Why do you feel the need to go around making people sound like an arsehole?
@_date: 2016-12-08 10:15:20
I seriously thought the entire community would be chomping at the bit to get segwit activated. As a user it's disappointing to see all the political posturing getting in the way of progress.
I have some reservations about the mentality of some of the big miners, and am starting to wonder if segwit will ever go live. I know Matt Corallo and Johnson Lau are on a diplomatic errand in China this weekend, but I think more time and money should be invested in opening up dev-miner relations. Does anyone even know *why* Bitmain et all are holding out? What are they waiting for?
@_date: 2016-11-11 16:51:03
I'm of the same opinion preeeeetty much. However, the more decentralized the less we even have to spend time worrying about it.
@_date: 2016-11-29 14:44:21
I agree. As you say, the argument that mining ought to become more decentralised in the future is not only an argument that favours preparing for off-chain scaling, but one that favours optimisations to bitcoins base layer, rather than expansions of it (segwit vs unlimited).
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:37:39

I'm expressing the concern that if any one miner owns too much hash power, it's bad for bitcoin for a number of reasons.
@_date: 2016-11-24 10:51:19
I do think it's time for the community who support SegWit to start putting pressure on those responsible for holding it back. Unfortunately I feel it's necessary to point out there's no need to be inflammatory in the process; just make your voice as a consumer or an advocate of bitcoin heard in a reasoned manner.
So far all the blame for "stalling" bitcoin scaling has been directed towards Core, and now we have an update within reach that includes a scaling improvement and a host of other benefits. Today the same people who were most vocal in airing their scaling concerns in the past are the ones standing in the way of SegWit, and they risk further politicising a debate that should focus squarely on the technical and economic merits of the proposal.
How best to do this, I don't know. A start would be to tweet the miners whose support you want to see, including the  hashtag and your reason for wanting it implemented.
@_date: 2016-11-17 08:11:09

Is segwit necessary for schnorr?
@_date: 2016-11-17 07:36:18
Roger falls back on the censorship argument every time, because he knows that the BU dev team is nowhere near as qualified or diverse as Core.
It's a moot point anyway. When it comes to development the **only** thing that matters is shipping quality code that has been extensively peer reviewed and tested. The personalities and values of the developers is irrelevant. Besides, all the Core contributors I've seen on reddit are incredibly generous with their time, and go beyond their job description when it comes to getting involved with the broader bitcoin community.
I hope the miners see through Roger and his inane tantrum, and recognise that running BU, blocking SegWit, and/or supporting a hard fork will set bitcoin progress back years.
@_date: 2016-11-10 18:40:30

You can only give someone the benefit of the doubt for so long.
purported to be doing what he thought was best for bitcoin, and I used to believe him. But increasingly the amount of disruption and divisiveness he is creating in the community is coming off in bad faith. 
I no longer extend a charitable interpretation to anything he says or does. In fact I'm starting to believe that if Roger woke up tomorrow and realised that BU was a pile of shit, and Core was bitcoin's best hope at success, he would continue to behave in the same way he does now. It's as much about pride for Roger as anything else.
It's also irritating to see that he has this influence at all seeing as his only credential, which he can't go 5 minutes without reminding anyone, is that he was an early adopter. The sooner he gets out of the way of progress the better it will be for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:26:46
Really don't get why they invited Roger to join (I would guess he asked to be included on the panel). AFAICT the only "credential" he has is that he was an early adopter of Bitcoin. Can anyone tell me what interesting contributions he's made in recent years?
Edit: He comes across as an unprofessional panelist too. He is disrespectful to the moderator; when asked to give a 30 sec explanation of what BU are doing he avoids the question, instead talking about Core "hardforking" the "economic code" for about 4 minutes. He sees in black and white and talks in absolutes as a result - about bitcoin being "destroyed" by the fees and the full blocks, and making analogies about hardware as though we're all living in the First World with access to it. He's not at all open to nuanced arguments. He also made a point about economists looking at the "things that are unseen", suggesting that if we had 2mb blocks now one bitcoin would be worth $7,000 dollars, seemingly unaware that the same argument could be used to say one bitcoin would be worth 7 dollars in this alternate universe.
All in all it would have been a much more productive Q&amp;A without him. It's like accommodating a child at the dinner table when the adults are trying to have a serious conversation.
@_date: 2016-11-04 21:35:40

AFAIK he's working *with* Bitmain on that one, although that may just be with hardware/logistics.
I hope you're right. I wonder if Core have any ideas on how to incentivise pools to own smaller percentages of the total hashpower of the network.
@_date: 2016-11-25 18:04:33
You're asking for sources without providing any for your own claims?


I don't see what point you're trying to make. If your national currency is losing value hand over fist, you can use bitcoin effectively as a capital flight tool.
Check local bitcoin volumes, and the market value of bitcoin at exchanges that service those countries over the last 6 months. Then check changes in the monetary policy for the same countries over that time. See if you can put the two together.
@_date: 2016-11-20 12:54:43
At the time of the HK agreement did SegWit include the blocksize increase?
I really do not understand this obsession with 2mb. Why does it matter which form a blocksize increase comes in? 
And wouldn't you rather opt for the upgrade which *along with a blocksize increase* enables new developments and a transaction malleability fix?
@_date: 2016-11-17 08:56:36

@_date: 2016-12-04 18:52:00
Do you acknowledge that what might be good for bitcoin, might not necessarily be good for some businesses built on bitcoin today?
AFIACT, from a technological standpoint it is more difficult to develop a bitcoin that performs well as a currency than it does a store of value. That doesn't mean bitcoin won't be able to fulfil the role of p2p cash in the future, it's just harder to make it work well (fast &amp; cheap) with more and more people using it.

It's likely the percentage of miners supporting SegWit is unchanged, just more hashing power has come online for those who don't.

So we just pass new patches to bitcoin that are detrimental to the health of the network just for the sake of appeasing miners egos? That would change my understanding of bitcoin to being something closer to fiat than I previously thought, and would reduce its value in my eyes.
AFAICT this isn't just about money, which it ought to be for miners, if they are rational actors.

@_date: 2016-11-11 13:31:22
They're both forms of moderation. No one has the *right* to express their opinion on a privately owned online forum like reddit, but Roger seems to believe that's not the case.
If users were limited to creating a single account that they could be held publicly accountable for, I doubt anyone would have ever been banned from r/bitcoin. 


If that were true I would have been banned from r/bitcoin too. I've commented many times in the past that people shouldn't be banned from this sub, and we should let users vote down any content that is socially toxic. I've since changed my opinion somewhat (see above), once it became clear just how rife vote manipulation is in this community.
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:00:35
The majority of the arguments I've seen don't come from the miners themselves but random redditors on rbtc.

Yeah, it's hard to tell what impacts the price most... the lost liquidity or the lost confidence. I think the more hacks of exchanges we see, the less the latter will influence price, but the former presumably always will, relative to the size of the exchange.

I'm sure people have or are at least in the progress of losing credibility as time passes. Roger would be one example.
Even the people who don't know any better (which would have included me 5 or 6 months ago), are capable of judging peoples competence based on how they argue their point. For example, I distrust anyone whose idea of making a compelling argument involves talking louder and louder while repeating the same point and making non-sequiturs. I'm thinking of Roger again.

It's best to assume the worst IMO, given not only the history of crypto exchanges in general, but Bitfinex's in particular.

One thing that would be cool to add to the next video if you had the time would be the transaction fees in USD, and a running total of how much it would cost / how long it would take to do the same thing with fiat. I understand that would take a long time but I imagine it would broaden the audience and demonstrate why lightning is so awesome.

So it seems there are at least two big potential factors that would see the value of bitcoin match its true worth. 
1. If said potential catastrophic failure is deemed to be overblown or averted, whether that's bitcoin overcoming technical issues or attacks from governments and financial institutions.
2. The widespread adoption of bitcoin by the global community.
I wonder what other events would substantially help or hinder bitcoins development.

Everyone knew about ASICboost, and despite the anti-collaborative approach to patenting it, the are many who agree it's Bitmain's prerogative to do so. What is indefensible is blocking important upgrades needed by Bitcoin to make sure the covert use of ASICboost is not disabled.
If Bitmain were/are using ASICboost it would go a long way to explaining their behaviour towards SegWit and alternative scaling proposals. It also would explain their reluctance to welcome Greg's proposal preventing covert ASICboost use. It would also explain how they stay profitable, which until now has confused some miners. It would also explain their favouring extension blocks. It also explains why they've been mining so many empty blocks. The list goes on.
Bitmain's behaviour has been shameful to witness. And now, what? We're just suppose to swallow their press releases and half-baked defences? They've made it impossible for bystanders to trust them.
FWIW I don't think there's any need to launch smear campaigns against Bitmain. The company's approach to the scaling debate, their uncommunicative relationship with the broader ecosystem, and the unprofessionalism displayed by Jihan, is doing enough damage to the company's reputation without the need for outsiders to add to it.
So, I'm sorry. I just don't buy that Bitmain is a force for good in the Bitcoin space. In fact it's my opinion that every piece of evidence points to the opposite.

I'm curious if they're working hard at preparing some completely unpredictable and destructive stunt...
@_date: 2017-04-11 20:42:57
If the accusations are true, it seems impossible to underestimate the damage caused to Bitcoin by Bitmain over the last couple of years. I'm frankly amazed the price hasn't buckled on the news.
Personally I think it should be the community's number one priority to destroy Bitmain, even if it takes a PoW change to do so. Yes it would set Bitcoin back a great deal and cause a great deal of collateral damage to friendly miners, but preserving the core value proposition of Bitcoin is paramount.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:30:06
Agreed, it's a shame because from what I could make of the first few mins it seemed like an interesting talk, but it's just so unpleasant to listen to.
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:34:31
I thought the same thing! Especially for the older women of the group (who are generally less interested in "tech" than men).
It shouldn't be too unexpected, when you consider the ideals a group like this value align with those of bitcoin. Nonetheless it was a pleasant surprise to see people talking comfortably about how bitcoin is becoming part of their daily lives.

The best thing you could do would be to write​ to the big exchanges saying that you want SegWit activated and would like to see them support a UASF.

@_date: 2017-04-01 12:04:14


As pointed out, [this path could take the best part of a year]( There's a good chance a UASF will give us SegWit in this time, which, it's always worth reiterating, includes the 2mb+ bump "big blockers" originally claimed to want. It's not unreasonable to ask big blockers to give some ground now.


Unfortunately I don't think *anything* can end this "civil war". It should be clear by now that the blocksize debate actually has very little to do with the blocksize. It's not even anything to do with tx throughput anymore. The fact that we're in this mess is a testament to the fact Bitcoin's evolution can be disrupted by a disproportionately small number of people. A blocksize increase in todays climate would make this worse, or better if you're one of the said disruptors - which goes a long way to explaining their behaviour.

@_date: 2016-02-18 10:54:05
Isn't that because what we see at the moment isn't a true valuation of bitcoin, but rather a valuation that is based largely on speculative investment?
If it becomes more usable to the average person, it's value should largely shift from speculation to inherent value... at least that's my understanding, I could be wrong.

That's unfortunate, and I hope the positive feedback has helped dampen the effects of the negative.
As frustrating as it must be on a personal level, it seems this is yet another right of passage for Bitcoin. Over the last few months we've learned that the owners of Bitmain have absolutely no sense of shame or honesty, and any reasonable person now knows they simply cannot be trusted behave "decently" in any way if doing so comes at a financial cost.

AFAICT it doesn't force anyone out. If if it does cause problems for Bitmain, that's entirely their own fault for being underhanded with the development of their hardware, and Bitcoin will be safer for it.

He is, you're right, but he's not here now so Bitcoin belongs to, and exists to serve, us - everyone. That's why I asked you.
Also: if you can't tell the difference between a disdain for appealing​ to authority, and a disdain for an individual, that's not my problem. It does, however, mean I can't be bothered with this conversation, because you make it difficult to believe you're not just trolling.

I don't get why so many projects decide to implement their own currency though, it's pretty arrogant. No one cares how many SNGLS it costs to watch a show, they care how many dollars it costs.

I like this guy too, he makes analysis that are actually plausible.
The only thing is with this video is that he fails to mention the bitfinex hack, which seemed like the more likely reason for the fall in price. It was interesting how the drop in price seemed to mimic the drop in miners' profitability though.

So.. here's an annotated graph I just pulled from a [Zerohedge article]( If you follow the price of bitcoin regularly you'll recognise the three recent movements that are highlighted.
The annotations surprised me a little, because I had my own idea of what caused the price movements, which were:
* 1. Brexit ---&gt; Halving being priced in
* 2. Fed ---&gt; Bitfinex hack
* 3. G-20 ---&gt; Confidence recovery from hack and miners being squeezed
I know the correlation between events and the price of bitcoin aren't always easy to identify, but surely there's a general consensus as to what caused these swings?
Edit: personally I'm not convinced external macroeconomic factors such as those cited in the article are all that influential over the price of price of bitcoin (government bitcoin-related policy changes aside). I think world of bitcoin is still very much in its own little bubble, suggesting factors that are closer to home being responsible for price movements. Just my thoughts.

FWIW I own stocks in half a dozen businesses, all funded on platforms like this.

IMHO opinion, apart from bitcoin being its own killer app, the coolest thing that's actually out there and working is Abra.

I wonder why Santander favours Ethereum here.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:42:30
Because all "upgrades" have tradeoffs. Yes, increasing the blocksize means more transactions per second, but it also makes running a node more costly, sacrificing Bitcoin's decentralised nature. Plus SegWit2x was planned without the consent of the community, making it highly controversial - the antithesis of the spirit of bitcoin, a currency defined by its users.

There are large economic factions that want SegWit2x, but from what I can see they're motivated by what's best for their business models, not what's best for bitcoin. Granted I've created a bit of an echo chamber for myself, but it doesn't seem to me that SegWit2x has anything like the consensus or development strength it needs to be a success.
@_date: 2017-09-18 18:31:00


That's several thousand more people than signed the NYA.
How economically significant are they? Who knows... but I would imagine they are a better litmus test for sentiment in the bitcoin community than the handful of NYA signatories. Most of these businesses don't represent users, they just serve them.

Yeah. To be honest I wouldn't have minded that they closed my account as long as they had explained why and reassured me that my withdrawal had not been affected. I still don't know why my account has been terminated.
It depends how much money you have on the line. To me that kind of customer service doesn't instill a lot of trust.

I don't think it's that simple. I'm not even sure how compatible the roadmaps of Core and BU are, and I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few people went to work on something else (especially if SegWit doesn't make it into the game).


That's simply not true. Like I said, you only need to read the comments in a couple of threads in r/btc to see that.
@_date: 2016-10-05 20:31:50

Of course I did, that was the whole point of my post. Likewise when I saw the video of him defending MtGox, I thought he had a creepy disposition.


I can't speak for anyone else but I'm actually not convinced that's true. I think if Core were left to get on with things then in a few years bitcoin would *be* everything we want it to be. Roger obviously doesn't, but I just think he's wrong, so from my perspective he and BU are currently the biggest threat to the success of bitcoin.

Even if the fork doesn't happen they seem to have more than enough hashing power to block SegWit for the time being. I'm hopeful that pro-core miners will be able to up their contributions and collectively push support for the update above the 95% activation threshold for two weeks, but who knows what'll happen.

It's a long-awaited upgrade to the bitcoin protocol. AFAIK it fixes some problematic technical issues, should increase the transaction throughput by 1.7 once the big players have upgraded, and enables upgrades to be made easier in the future.

@_date: 2016-10-12 19:09:50
Depends. 
For example, if BU had enough hash power to push any changes they wanted to onto the protocol (a 2mb blocksize in this case), I think the market would go up briefly because the majority of people would assume bitcoin got an "upgrade" and the community resolved the internal conflict over the blocksize - that's where the short-term gain would come from. In the long-term I think the price would drop, and bitcoin development would stall... I get the impression the BU devs aren't as competent as Core and are more wreckless. That would be enough for me to pull out my savings. I think bitcoin would never live up to its potential as a result.

Because they were nationally and internationally devised projects with the cumulative wealth of whole nations pre-built into them.

I don't, so AFAICT any global non-political currency has to start at grass roots level (and so rely initially on speculation to grow).


I could have been clearer here, bitcoin has the potential to be the best currency. It's a work in progress. Despite being inconvenient, slow, and less stable than other currencies, even as it is it does some things better.

I'm not misinformed, I'm just not informed. Thanks for the explanation though, that all makes sense.
Could you not argue that people who have made a speculative investment in bitcoin, propping up its price and lending it credibility, deserve to be rewarded if the price increases? There is a potential wealth to bitcoin that extends beyond its value in dollar terms, and it relies on speculative investment to deliver on that. I've put some savings into bitcoin because yes, there's a part of me that wants to make easy money, money which I don't think I have the talent or determination to "create" myself. There's also a less selfish reason I invested in it too, because society has a lot to benefit from the nature of trade between individuals returning to its roots. I don't see what's wrong with that scenario - to me if the price of bitcoin takes off it's win-win for anyone holding bitcoin *and* for society at large. Sure it would be better if we were all like Elon Musk creating industries and jobs out of thin air, but that's not reality.
I might have exposed myself for being misinformed again here, but that's the way I see things at this point in time... now can you reneg on your comment to the SEC, please :P

If you're anything like me, all you have is your intuition to tell you who to place your trust (and savings) in. Who comes across as competent and scrupulous, and who doesn't. From what I can tell Roger is either competent with no scruples, or has scruples but is incompetent. I might be wrong, but I'm betting my bitcoin savings I'm not.

I think people downvoted because you didn't describe the full story.
On the face of it, and in the short-term, bigger blocks probably would increase adoption/value of bitcoin. But nothing I've seen from the BU devs suggests they have the talent to take bitcoin anywhere after that, and may in fact damage the ecosystem. Core have made a lot of improvements in the last two years, but peoples attention is fixed on the blocksize debate. We might have to wait a bit longer for the more tangible upgrades from Core, but they actually do have the talent and the roadmap to take bitcoin all the way.

@_date: 2016-10-31 17:43:06
It's good if you want the SegWit upgrade to get merged into bitcoin (ViaBTC do not). Hashrate refers to a measure of the computational power owned by a miner, which they use to mine blocks. It's also what is used to "vote" in favour or against proposed changes to bitcoins code.

I can't see that happening, and even if they did it would do nothing to heal the community. You only need to spend 15 mins in r/btc to realise just how much the big block community love to hate Core.
I think they would continue to work on their implementation and trust the wider industry to put their faith in them. In this case, with two competing currencies, confidence in bitcoin(s) would take a hit and I'd expect to see the price drop. I'll be selling up if it looks like that's what's going to happen.

Besides, why do people have such a hard on for blocksize? An increase in blocksize necessarily means a decrease in security, and the bottom line is - it's throughput that matters. No one would give a shit if we had a 100kb blocksize if Bitcoin could process 100,000 tx/s.

There are more and more businesses offering services that help track a coins history. If a coin you hold has a dirty past the concern is it that it could be confiscated or tracked. Obviously this has a knock on effect in confidence over bitcoin, reducing the value of all coins (even clean ones).
@_date: 2016-10-29 09:40:01

@_date: 2017-05-08 17:09:30
The trend of relying on non-hash power consensus correlates with the trend of hash-power becoming non-representative of users and businesses (centralised).
It's unclear how much hashpower is owned directly by Bitmain, but for the sake of the argument let's say it's 10%. In this scenario two people would hold a 'vote' worth 10%. In what world can this be considered representative of the community? These two people could have motives that are at odds with the community even.
The more mining becomes centralised and prohibitive for everyday users, which is arguably already the case, the more useless hashpower is as a metric to show consensus. It is *part* of what makes up consensus, but to pretend it represents anything other than the desires of a handful of people is naive.

A comment from another of their mods in the same thread...




I wonder if r/btc will just out-hate itself to the point where no one with any credibility will spend time there.
I personally believe there should be no censorship in this community, but am starting to understand why r/bitcoin started banning people. 
The problem starts with being able to create a new account in a matter of seconds. Reddit is an imperfect forum for discussion when you have such a polarized community, and the bad actors in it are willing to go to any lengths to manipulate the dialogue. For some time r/btc has been a good example of this, and it's evident that the political dishonesty that takes priority over all things is beginning to push people who want a reasoned discussion out. Eventually all that will be left are a few conspiracy theorists, roger and some bots.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:45:55
How do we get the signatories of the NY Agreement who are good actors to realise this? The evidence is incontrovertible and widely spread over reddit and twitter from what I've seen.

I would argue it already is a working store of value, depending on your circumstances, but the reality is it that still comes with significant risks.

It's most valuable properties often get overlooked.
It is the first currency that provides users with financial sovereignty - money that they control, that can't be devalued by governments, that can't be confiscated by banks, that can be transferred across borders no questions asked. There are other more technical benefits that I am either unaware of or can't explain, but the social implications alone are incredibly compelling. I'm sure others are able to add to this list.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:57:41

The price also dropped a couple percent the same day Roger posted a bunch of graphs showing how much BU's hashing power has increased. Related? No, but if the price had gone up r/btc would have attributed it to that news.
The confirmation bias displayed by big blockers is remarkable.

And what innovation worth noting has come from said altcoin developers?
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:00:22
Let's hope so. I think the sense of urgency we've seen from businesses over the past couple of days has brought it to the front of the conversation.
Once the "industry leaders" realise that a SegWit softfork, whether activated by users or miners (which are profiting from it's delay), is the only feasible scaling boost we have in the short-term, hopefully they will come around too.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:23:41
Look, if you don't have any qualms advising people on what to do with their money, knowing the risks - fine!
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:36:09
Good on you for writing. These kinds of posts need to remain visible for the next 10 weeks.
The social and financial disruption manufactured by Bitmain in trying to stall SegWit will go down as one of the biggest scandals in Bitcoin's history. BIP148 will go down as one of the biggest victories for the protocol and it's users.
@_date: 2017-05-30 10:14:17
Just as well they can then... once we shake off Bitmain's chokehold.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:54:10
It looks bad, but you shouldn't dismiss the *possibility* that Wright *is* Satoshi, or that Gavin got hacked.

If any currency is ever going to be used by &gt;X people then surely that has to happen. How else do you redistribute billions, if not trillions of dollars of value from fiat to whatever global currency replaces it?


There's no telling whether or not Blockstream would have existed if the price hadn't exploded, and from what I can tell they are putting more effort into re-decentralizing mining power than any other development team.
I doubt there will ever be a perfect form of money, but Bitcoin is by far the best we have at this moment in time IMO. I don't really understand why you'd want to stand in the way of it.
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:59:51
If having two different bitcoin currencies are good, why stop there? Forget unlimited blocksize, let's make unlimited bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:56:58
Sounds like you think code just pops out of thin air. People are working hard on this and making a lot of encouraging process. You're going to make a fool out of yourself if you keep saying "vaporware"... I would be willing to bet you thought SegWit was vaporware at one point too.
@_date: 2016-10-24 13:53:01
It was meant to be a little tongue-in-cheek.
@_date: 2016-10-20 11:03:02
Sorry, I don't really know what that means. 
I like Christopher Hitchens, aside from that I didn't put much thought into my username. I'd like to think we share a lot of the same values, but I don't pretend to have anything like the smarts on that man.
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:41:26


That's kind of the point I was making. Segwit could be activated by Christmas, but if BU wanted to make a case for blocking it (by suggesting it doesn't provide enough of a throughput increase), then spamming the network now would be a good way to do so.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:30:25
The only "agreement" they have the power to make is on a scaling *proposal*, or on a BU fork. Nothing goes any further than that without the consent of the users.
@_date: 2017-05-16 15:03:39
I admit there must be lots of users who don't even know what the "scaling debate" is, but AFAIK there's no way of gauging the numbers. Time will tell.
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:06:59
I imagine once one goes through there would be little opposition to the other. Will be interesting to see if the promise of insurance sways the SEC.
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:39:17
So seeing as the innovation of BU devs is limited to changing the block size, this could turn into a stalemate whereby Core can't push any big code changes?
I wish the tinfoil hat crew could see the irony in that being anti-blockstream also makes them anti-scaling and anti-innovation.
@_date: 2016-10-10 23:04:47

I read the article he wrote but not the paper. There wasn't any reference to time frames, so I don't know how big a problem this is. He did mention that we have a reasonable about of runway left to explore solutions.

It can't be confiscated by banks. That much is true, and the same can't be said of fiat.

I can't help thinking we'll lose the war against apathy.
In the event of a chain split what happens to all the nodes that *aren't* signalling UASF, but *are* signalling for MASF of SegWit?
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:38:22
Who knows how many people running full nodes are even aware of BIP 148?
With hindsight it seems that setting the activation date so early will have been a mistake.
@_date: 2016-10-16 11:43:21
I think Roger is more interested in making money in the short-term than he is in the success of bitcoin in the long-term. I think he's standing in the way of bitcoin to be honest. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2016-05-11 13:16:47
I think I got that. Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:36:22
I understand what they're saying, but it seems a lot of people will regard Bitcoin as a failure if, say, Ethereum gains a higher market cap. Seems odd to me when Bitcoin is more valued today than it has been in its entire history.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:37:12
UASF *is* happening on August 1st, regardless of how many people get behind it. My guess is that over the next couple of months, many will.
@_date: 2016-10-31 09:10:54
Why are so many nodes still running 0.12.1 or earlier?
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:35:43
Your implied point plus unnecessary insult.
It might be a meaningless platitude to you, but it's​ one that seemed to escape the attention of the person I was talking to, before you butted in.
Also FWIW, I would in fact classify Bitmain and ViaBTC as a major players whom, if not out of touch with their users wants and needs, are actively working against them for the sake of additional profit.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:23:51
There's Coinfloor too, worth checking out as an option.
@_date: 2016-05-03 06:23:41
If only for the sake of the community they should restore it.
For one thing it's not as if Gavin could make any commits that would go unnoticed, let alone go live. There's also no way on Earth he would intentionally do something to damage bitcoin. 
A symbolic gesture from Core here would go a long way towards not dividing the community even further (r/btc will be a no-go-zone for months if they don't give it back).
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:36:51
Measuring consensus is a difficult task, but everything we can measure (bar miner signalling) suggests support for SegWit is vast. ViaBTC's own twitter poll showed 83% support for it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:31:00
Cypherpunks are pretty anti-authoritarian.
@_date: 2017-05-08 16:08:32
No need to troll.
Twitter polls aren't a serious metric but they are do reveal something, and over 6,000 people responded when ViaBTC asked if SegWit should be activated.
Like I said; there's not one figure we can point to and say "there - X shows that we have consensus", but we can look at a combination of sources to get an idea of community sentiment.
Nodes - 
Businesses - 
Community -  (not sure how this one is calculated)

If you get "downvoted to oblivion" it will be for talking shit like this.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:50:10
I used to visit there; a year ago I even used to support the 2mb HF. However I got down voted into oblivion for stating simple facts. Now I have a post cap on my account, which was enough for me to give up on it. It's also incredibly toxic and full of conspiracy theorists, altcoin hodlers maximalists and liars. In short, it's a shit hole with very low-grade and misinformed conversation going on.
Time will be able to separate the truths from the untruths, and I'm 99% confident that in 10 years time rbtc, Roger Ver, and Jihan Wu/Bitmain will have gone down in the history books for being some of the most divisive and destructive forces in Bitcoin's early life.
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:01:34
I think probably more likely the opposite, fragmentation is good for the digital economy, including for bitcoin. The more time that passes the more specialized each currency will likely become. I'm not worried about bitcoin anyway really, think it will be fine.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:34:47
I'm no psychologist, but there's something about his body language, vernacular and the way he addresses the interview generally that really give me pause for trusting his claim.
He states that he doesn't want attention or accolade, but despite this apparent reluctance doesn't explain what's driving him to out himself.
He states that he will never issue another interview ever, insulating himself from ever having to defend his claims in a transparent setting.
I'm not saying that he is not Satoshi Nakamoto, but IMO there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about his claim. Especially considering that it ought to be trivial for Satoshi to provide concrete proof, if he wanted to.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:43:37
I hope so. There's nothing I'd like to see more than Bitmain get sued out of existence. 
Funnily enough that's exactly the kind of justice Bitcoin set out to serve.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:24:13
Agreed. 
Gavin's been given a harder time than he deserves over this. At worst he got duped, which can happen to anyone. The important thing to realise is that he's not a bad actor, and you don't have to be a big block supporter to see this.

I don't think I did misunderstand him. I agreed with him. 
They will move to other coins, when other coins offer more (not just transaction throughput, but security, stability, popularity and investment).
Until a coin comes along that can offer all that, the move will be from fiat to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 07:17:30
I think it's more likely that late 2013 to early 2015 will look like an anomaly in Bitcoin's growth in retrospect. If you cut out that noise we have a pretty smooth exponential curve forming. Not saying Bitcoin won't experience bubbles that will burst again, but it's more difficult to manipulate the price now than it was in 2013 and users are more savvy.

If you say so. IMHO anything that can be interpreted as investment advice should include 'don't invest what you can't afford to lose'.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:34:26
Those claims are rbtc conspiracy theories which have been refuted. At this moment in time Bitmain is singlehandedly holding Bitcoin back to make extra cash - a *real* demonstration of a powerful entity whose interests are not aligned with those of users / the protocol.
@_date: 2017-05-17 18:57:48
So if in 5 years time Bitmain owned 100% of the hashpower, you would still be happy with 1 hash 1 vote? In other words a currency whose rules are dictated by one person? Doesn't really sound like Bitcoin to me.

I agree that it feels rushed, but the thing is BIP148 *will* activate on august 1st whatever happens. So it makes sense to support it now.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:16:35
My biggest concern is how foggy estimates of support are. There also seems to be a lot of apathy in the community, due to general weariness over the scaling debate and the misinformation war that's been going on.
The next 10 weeks are going to be interesting to say the least. If BIP148 gets pulled off it will be such an incredible victory for Bitcoin! I urge everyone reading this thread to recognise that they have the power to make it a success.

What's to be jealous of? He's an unethical, selfish liar who has set back protocol development for months if not years, in order to profit from it.

@_date: 2016-05-18 22:02:08
While I agree that this sub has its problems - namely too much circlejerk and censorship, r/btc is a *total* cesspit. IMO it is not an alternative bitcoin subreddit, it is an anti-bitcoin Core subreddit pure and simple.
You cannot post *anything* on there without it turning into a inflammatory shitfest of "Blockscheme Core" this, "the Core Junta" that - the charged language alone should be enough to raise a red flag in the minds of readers.
Then there's the conspiracy theories, the FUD, the unreasonable users who think bitcoin belongs to them, the users who claim to *know* with certainty the future, the alt-coin fanboys, etc. etc. The list of reasons to avoid that sub is endless. The only reason to visit it is to expose yourself to different views and the occasional interesting post that doesn't show up on here.
I would love to see their faces if Core fulfil the promise of bitcoin and the price skyrockets, while they sold at $400... here's hoping :)

That depends how far down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole you like to go. IMHO there's no reason to believe this. Gavin comes across as a genuine guy who has put a lot of time and effort into building bitcoin. 
Just because something is *possible*, it doesn't mean it's worth the same amount of attention as what's most probable.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:20:18

Bitcoin is as fast as its ever been. It's just more expensive.

Core added a blocksize increase to SegWit (the same increase "big blockers had been requesting), and as soon as they did so suddenly 2mb wasn't enough.
TL;DR: Core already compromised. "Big blockers" are dishonest.
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:37:46
If it weren't for BIP148 forcing his hand we wouldn't be seeing segwit any time soon.
@_date: 2016-10-26 13:09:01
I wonder how much of BU's funds Roger allocated to this? 
I highly doubt it's a coincidence that this is happening just as SegWit is ready to go live.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:46:19
Thanks. So would you just send your bitcoin to one of these exchanges post-fork and find deposits of both currencies in your account?
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:08:50
I think whether or not it dumps depends on the reasons for the pump. If this is money leaking out of China and Venezuala then there's good reason to believe the rise is here to stay. No one *really* seems to know what's going on, though.

I've done my research. If a more competent development team than Core come along, I'll support them. Until that day...
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:14:35
Depends which way it goes. If BIP148 is successful and causes minimal disruption it ought to increase confidence in the resilience of Bitcoin to ward off bad actors.

FTFY. It all boils down to users. Security is critical too, but users were able to provide it once, they can do so again. Far more preferable than the situation we're in now IMO, where 2x spells the death of Bitcoin as we know.
Edit: FTFY
 
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:46:31
It's worth being skeptical about all price predictions, but generally speaking if someone says the price "*could*" do X, I'm way more likely to have faith in them than if they say it "*will*" do X.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:21:55
I'm not a computer scientist, nor an economist, I can't parse the code and make my own mind up as to its technical merit, so yes - to some extent I have to appeal to authority.
However, everything I've learned through talking to other people in the space, and seeing the respect given to Core by the people actually writing code and building businesses on Bitcoin (and are subsequently better judges than me) tell me I'm backing the right team. On top of that the BU guys come across as completely trolls, on a social and professional level.
Like I said, when a demonstrably more competent development team come along I'll support them instead. I want what's best for Bitcoin, and at the moment that's what Core is offering.
PS. Ironically, I didn't have to go far back in your comment history to see appeals to authority too. Try harder next time.
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:38:51
The final say lies with the users, always has done and always will. If users think Bitcoin offers nothing worth paying for, the price will drop to zero and all the businesses built on top of it will fold. Regardless of the number of nodes which enforce BIP148, if users value that chain more then exchanges, businesses and miners will be obliged to follow (or go bust).
You've got it the wrong way round.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:55:47


You're welcome to your opinion but that's bullshit, IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-18 11:48:47
You should wait until closer the date. Two months is a lifetime in Bitcoin.

Don't call this a PSA, it's just opinion.
@_date: 2016-07-30 17:58:44
A great read and very reassuring. I hope this gets good coverage in the Chinese community. 
Anyone who follows bitcoin frequently (as in checks reddit and twitter a few times a day for updates) knows, it's easy to get distracted by all the bullshit and noise. This was a refreshing reminder of the bigger picture.
Also nice too see some real praise and respect shown for gmax and the Core team.

Anyone can pull random numbers out of their arse. Do you care to prop them up with some reasoning?
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:59:23
Well they have to pay the bills somehow. Doesn't necessarily mean they're selling all the coins they're holding, just enough to cover the costs of running the business for the next however many weeks.

In that case it's a shame the latest, much lengthier comment lays out why bitcoin is apparently a ponzi scheme :/

@_date: 2017-05-31 09:43:50
As ever - thanks for your insight!
As much as I would like to see enough of the community rally around BIP148 to make it a success in its own right, I think the best outcome currently would be that it pressures miners into signalling for the original BIP.
Never a dull day in Bitcoin land.

Wonder if the folks at the SEC will take this into consideration when deciding whether or not to approve the Winklevoss ETF.

@_date: 2016-07-02 14:17:49
I just use the recommended fee on my mycelium wallet. The longest I had to wait was an hour at its worst for 1 confirmation, but it's usually about 10-15 min. I'm never in a rush when I use my bitcoin though, so it doesn't affect me, although I can see why some people get irritated by it.
@_date: 2016-07-31 23:43:14

@_date: 2016-07-03 21:55:19
Well, we're at $660 per bitcoin now and a $10b market cap. So if the market cap hit $100b then each bitcoin would be worth $6,600. Depending on where the OP lives you would need at least a couple hundred bitcoin to be able to retire.

@_date: 2016-07-11 00:16:00
Most non-bitcoiners think direct involvement with bitcoin should be avoided. This gives those people the opportunity to invest in it, in a manner that's comfortable for them. It'll be big for bitcoin if/when the ETF goes through, not sure why you sound so against it.
@_date: 2016-07-26 00:12:08
Interesting conversation, well worth a listen IMO.
@_date: 2016-07-14 14:36:14
I was expecting a drop immediately after the halving; as short-term investors looking to make a quick buck sold out, but we never saw the price rise to give them a decent exit.
IMO there is currently no reason to believe there will be a drop below 600 (potentially ever again), and I'd be very surprised to see it fall below 500.
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:23:13
Huffpost really is shite. This is just a badly written opinion piece.
@_date: 2016-07-23 11:34:52
Not quite... he said when it broke 700 this year it wouldn't stop until it hit 1,000.
@_date: 2016-07-19 09:14:45
Whatever it is, I'm sure it has nothing to do with self interest. /s
I don't think we'll have to put up with it for much longer. As the community grows and it becomes easier to see past the FUD, bad actors like this will become increasingly marginalised.
@_date: 2016-07-02 13:52:32
I wonder what kind of transactions/uses cause the higher fees. I've still not paid over $0.08 for any of my sends yet. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:18:17
Cheers. That approval means a lot to certain groups of investors though, and the fact it costs $millions to acquire gives it more legitimacy.
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:08:43
Do you know if testing by the wider community has raised any issues with SegWit that need ironing out (or where one can look to find these)?

@_date: 2016-07-19 21:31:16
Pretty sure someone posted this guys video a couple weeks back where he said the same thing (and it was supposed to have happened by now). 
Does he just repeat himself over and over until he gets it right, and everyone forgets all the times he was wrong before then?
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:51:53
It boggles the mind...
@_date: 2016-07-25 09:08:07
It's possible for someone to believe in more than one cryptocurrency without it making them a "pumper". If someone is pumping, it means they're looking for short term gains. I'm fairly certain Andreas is in this for the long haul (already has been).
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:57:42

Is there a date for whenever this is going live?

Owning a gold certificate isn't the same as owning gold, but that doesn't automatically make it a scam. Similarly not every banker is inherently unethical. The world isn't as black and white or as cynical as you make out.

I *despise* the refusal to answer yes/no questions with a straight answer.
I'm all for the supposed goals of the NY Agreement, but things like this, and the initial plan to make Frakensegwit incompatible with the nodes currently supporting it, do not inspire trust. On the contrary; they make everyone suspicious.
@_date: 2016-07-31 13:38:47
It's bullshit. Predicts the same thing every couple of weeks, so obviously it gets it right once in a while and people freak out.

If the process is complicated it could take a while before noobs (myself included) would be able to dump their legacy coins.

@_date: 2016-07-05 09:54:42
Isn't profitability linked to scalability? I thought that as the mining reward continues to drop, transaction fees are expected to fill the gap. Then you have business models like Rootstock which claim to provide extra income for miners for keeping the network secure.
I'm less concerned about energy costs. Thanks to renewables we're moving towards a world where energy will be virtually free.
@_date: 2016-07-04 21:08:15
Not very discreet though, is it :P
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:36:33
You always let anger cloud your perspective. You have a single, close-minded view of what bitcoin should be, and anything outside of that you shout down. It makes me think bitcoin will never end up being what you hope it will.
This is good news for bitcoin. period.

This is worth watching all the way through for the opinions, jokes and camaraderie, but if there's one thing I'll be taking away from this it was Andreas' comment on how the Canadian banks could step up to fill the hole left by Vogogo leaving the Canadian market.

@_date: 2017-06-19 10:06:02
Thanks for the explanation.
So if, after SegWit is activated, the segwit2x blocksize increase looked too contentious, miners would have to switch back to a Core (or other consensus compatible client) in order to prevent forking off the network?
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:24:49
Thanks, I know :) I'm just curious to see what correlation there is with the projection and the price of bitcoin in the days following the halving... if any ;)
@_date: 2016-07-05 09:45:37
Wouldn't it just mean mining would become more profitable? Presumably the cost of running a mining rig would drop, but miners would still have to come up with the capital to buy the equipment in the first place. It ought to lead to more decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-03 08:55:37
Pretty much agree that it's an unfortunate accident of history that China turned out to be the country with perfect infrastructure for mining operation and ASIC production. They just don't share the values that lead to tech innovations like the internet, or, indeed, Bitcoin. Without Chinas involvement I don't think the scaling debate would have become what it is today; we would definitely have SW right now, and the community would be much less polarised.
It is what it is, however. I hope with all my heart that BIP148 at the very least kills off the perception that 1 hash = 1 vote, and that miners have the last say on Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:33:46
If SegWit gets activated via segwit2x, does it mean miners will no longer be running Core clients?
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:00:24
I'm saying if 1% of the value of gold found its way into bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:20:06
I'm confused about the blocksize increase part.
Why, with every new update from the NYA, is there so much ambiguity? It should be obvious that any vague details open to interpretation will spread confusion and mistrust, and delay progress further.
edit: or have I got it wrong and it's just the troll comments that are misleading?
edit2: Would someone tell that Jared guy to STFU? He's 100% a technically retarded redditor like me, he really doesn't belong there.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:16:24
Seeing as consensus around a HF by that date can't be guaranteed, is the idea that activation of SegWit is conditional on *forcing* a HF regardless (ie. splitting chains unless entire community is on board)?
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:24:42
It's definitely a good thing that it's restricted, I was just curious if the only comment on there had any weight.

@_date: 2016-07-06 07:47:50


Just being pedantic, but it's more to do with the % of hashing power which is lost, rather than the number of miners.
I don't know how likely this scenario is anyway. Was just listening to a podcast with Andreas on it, and he was saying that a lot of the miners are on fixed electricity contracts, which means they will be paying for their electricity after the halving even if they switch off all their equipment. Says nothing about how profitable it will be for them to continue mining, but it suggests they're long on bitcoin.

I think HL might be the more noob-friendly option. Thanks!

If there's a split it will be a total clusterfuck which will hurt "average joe" users confidence and trust in Bitcoin (or the entities that govern it in their own way). Household users aren't going to put the time and effort into finding out what caused the split, and the potential loss of their savings, they'll just think it was all one big scam.
Our best hope is that miners understand this, and avoid a split at all costs. They can do this simply by signalling for the BIP148 UASF themselves, or rallying around BIP141 and locking in SegWit before August 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:11:24
Looking at his recent contributions to the NYA WG github, James seems to be a bit of an unsung hero. It's a shame his work isn't getting more attention on here - it could be worth supporting.
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:57:52
This isn't about SegWit anymore. It's about the mining monopoly taking new technology hostage.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:41:06
The whole point in doing it is that's it's easy to conceal. The circumstantial evidence when you look at the hashrate history is quite convincing though - a handful of pools have popped up with huge amounts of hashpower overnight, while Antpool simultaneously lost some.
Bitmain have corroded all trust and do not deserve the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:50:56
Isn't the idea that SegWit activates before UASF can cause a split, giving us up to 6 months of usable SegWit time before the 2mb HF?
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:43:57

@_date: 2017-06-07 14:36:03
:( just don't kick yourself four years from now!
@_date: 2016-07-29 07:10:26
When's the meet up taking place?
@_date: 2016-07-07 21:05:04
You could be right, I don't know much about shorting. Either way it seems like a good opportunity for everyone else to buy too.
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:33:19
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:57:31
Shame. They're totally squandering an opportunity to let Jihan save face, and avoid a chain split it seems.
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:43:45
I agree it's rushed and risky, and personally would rather we keep the status quo, but let's not forget why we're in this situation. Bitmain is at fault here for pushing people into acting out of desperation.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:16:46
I see, thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-15 10:42:11
Slow news day?
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:38:00
Yes, but my point is the 1 CPU = 1 vote days are over, and the fact is mining continues to trend towards monopolisation.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:22:09
I wonder if there are any other examples of Ponzi schemes that grew consistently for 7 years without being exposed...
@_date: 2016-07-07 08:39:06
These sharp dips tend to be around the same size. Presumably this must be quite a large number of coins entering the market... what's the chance I these are miners selling off stockpiled coins to pay the bills?
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:01:28
Are you able to share your stance on BIP148?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:28:31
Awesome, thanks for organising it!
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:24:37
I understand the importance of signatories to feel like they're in control of everything, but this is so convoluted. They could *just* activate SegWit, and see! My God.
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:13:35
Might be because he's been blocking an opt-in feature for the last half a year.
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:23:35
He looks broke.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:27:56
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:37:58
Because it means you don't have to change your behaviour?
Just speaking as someone who feels your pain. I'm especially plugged in at the moment since it feels like the next couple of months could be do or die for Bitcoin.
P.S. fuck Jihan.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:10:31
So this was just coincidence? Lol :P
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:49:00
Thanks, I see. Well I know where my bitcoin are staying.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:18:46
Well that seems like time poorly spent, as you don't have a clue how it works.
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:54:00
Die is an option, although I think it's an unlikely option. Big price drop is a *likely* option if we don't avoid a chain split, and how well the price recovers depends on how long lasting the split is, users response to it and the media FUD. Diversification is never a bad idea (even if it means going back to fiat for a period of uncertainty), but I can't advise you any which way because I don't even know what to do myself. These are unchartered waters :/
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:58:22
1. The white paper is not an infallible doctrine that we need to live and die by.
2. One CPU one vote is only relevant to the degree to which CPUs are decentralised.
3. What difference would there be between Bitcoin and fiat if it can be controlled by half a dozen people? None. It would defeat the purpose of it existing.
@_date: 2016-07-06 05:43:23
Lol. Make enough predictions and you'll be right some of the time.
@_date: 2016-07-30 13:42:52
Do you guys have a roadmap or an ETA for going live?
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:31:06
You should be careful buying big quantities on Kraken - especially using market orders. Their GBP books are extremely thin.
@_date: 2017-06-02 09:00:36
Why do a half-baked job of something, when the option is there to do things properly?
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:39:16
If you think "BSCore" is the problem, run a different client.
@_date: 2016-07-09 15:56:04
Can't believe I am watching somebody else watch at a static website right now... but I am.
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:30:43
Making each bitcoin worth about $5k?
@_date: 2016-07-07 23:25:45
This is the first interesting article I've read regarding the block size debate for as long as I can remember. It goes beyond the same old platitudes your read in these subs, and is written well enough for anyone to understand. Good stuff.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:07:05
New UI looks sweeeeeeeeet!
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:28:03
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:16:59
Bit misleading to post a Twitter link with a title that isn't what the person said.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:04:47
Well said. Simply put - it's nothing personal.
Their ideas are born from a deep understanding of the tech, and gleaned from studying the available data. I have faith that if everyone here had the same level of knowledge and experience as the Core developers have, they'd come to the same conclusions as to how best scale Bitcoin.
