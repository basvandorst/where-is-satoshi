Ebay already announced they are going with [Adyen]( Whoever wrote this article either wrote it weeks ago or didn't do any research. This doesn't necessarily mean you'll be able to use bitcoin directly on ebay through Adyen, though.

For it to continue as it works not it requires a constant influx of new money to keep the price increasing at the rate it is. If it stops increasing all the current "investors" will bail because they're not getting a return anymore, which will tank the market. What we have at the moment is a pyramid scheme.
