I’m gonna act like I didn’t do that... 
I still have $200 but I’m waiting till BTC is under $13,500

Make sure the doctor is legit. Been seeing a lot of Bitcoin scams lately. Best of luck to your family and especially daughter. ����

tried to buy BTC during the dip, my order kept getting canceled,  one week later I’m now checking my bank statements and Coinbase is charging me for what I tried to buy, then also charging me $37 for the “Return of NSF” fee. 
I’m now negative $750 in my bank account and I’m just an 18 year old kid trying to make ends meet. I don’t even have the BTC in my coinbase account that they charged me for.
I’m going to the bank tomorrow to see if there’s anything to do but I doubt the bank will do anything. Has this happened to anyone before? What can I say to the bank? Is there any way of getting out of this?

Just to clarify I tried to buy the BTC during the dip when the exchange rate was at $10,500.

I kept getting the email from coinbase that my transaction was getting canceled. I assumed it was due to all the traffic from the dip that my purchase wasn’t going thru.

You’d be stupid not to shoot your shot ����‍♂️ all I need is like $600 lol

I have the overdraft protection on my account which states everyday uses with my debit card will be canceled if I don’t have the funds in my checking account. Also I have the emails from coinbase saying every time I tried to purchase bitcoin my transaction was canceled

I’ve just been hearing about a “fork”. I’m a noob so I have no idea what that means but when by the context it doesn’t seem good.

Don’t worry I put $500 into bitcoin at an exchange rate of $19,000 today. Just know you aren’t alone in the shitty HODL’ing right now

You could just pay for gas and groceries for a year or two. But buying a new car with that money or put a down payment on a house and the IRS will be on your ass.
