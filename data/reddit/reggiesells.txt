Wouldn't it be neat if you could have it modded to hash as low as possible to help continue its life. Put it in the most clean vaccum (do computers work in vaccums?) and have the parts restored if possible. Then years from now we can tell our grand kids "I remember when bitcoin started, See that... Thats the first asic ever; it's still hashing"

thats because they want it to look scammy. get ppl to sell when they should be buying
