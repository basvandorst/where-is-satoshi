I didn't say it was political, I said he is being shady like a politician. With lines like this:


Characterizing privacy and anonymity as amounting to people wanting to get a cheap high.
We have plenty of politicians trying to paint bitcoin as being a haven for drug trade, and attacking things like encryption, and ultimately attacking privacy. We don't need that from someone talking on behalf of OpenBazaar.
If they are too busy to work on it, they should just say that, trying to smear privacy concerns in that way is shady.
If you don't think privacy is a big deal, why don't you share with everyone here and your neighbors your IP address, how many bitcoins you have, where you live, all the items you have in your OpenBazaar store?

No one said miners are changing the rules, A 'guardian's role isn't to make rules but they can prevent changes!
And yes miners ultimately want bitcoins to be valuable, but they can only stop changes and not make changes. They also choose who they trust, which is currently core.
But how much value of bitcoin was lost when the blocks became full? There is no easy way to tell but you can see bitcoin rallying and then a drop from that period and then followed by over a month of stagnation, you also should be looking at several altcoins following the same period and you see those rising while bitcoin became stagnate. Consumers were not content with bitcoin!
So consumers are speaking, you are simply not looking at the damage that was caused by not responding before blocks became full.
Equally so when shapeshift went down altcoins, conversely, started losing value and bitcoin stopped stagnating and we start seeing growth again. This is also why we see verbal attacks made against shapeshift by some Bitcoin Maximalists (some odd professor and a 'Wall St Vet') because they don't like the fact that consumers demonstrate they don't like blocks being full!
Multi-currency exchanges that are easy to use like ShapeShift are ultimately what's going to keep Core in check by providing alternatives for those not happy with bitcoin core.
* Consumers/users decide by their feet.
* Miners decide by accepting/rejecting protocol changes.
* Core speculates on what is best (where are they doing user surveys and polls?).

fungiblity isn't a technical feature of bitcoin, its just that people (and governments) don't yet care about tainted coins and addresses, but maybe after a few more mtgox, cryptsys, and shapeshift hacks they will start caring.
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:59:45


Coins are only indistinguishable when they are at the same address, but **not all coins are at the same address**, so not all coins are indistinguishable. They need to have some distinguishable characteristic for you to know you have coins at your address at all!


Doesn't matter the coins don't belong to what ever address they end up at. People will (and have in past) want to get their stolen coins back where ever they end up.


Most people/businesses have empty receiving addresses, where they could if they wanted look at the history of the received coins before mixing them with clean coins or decide to put them with equally tainted coins or returning them to the sender or reporting them to the authorities, etc.
You could have hackers randomly disbursing their stolen goods on clean addresses but not only would they take a loss, but they would be doing this because **bitcoin is not fungible**, if bitcoin were fungible there would be no point in them doing this, would there be?
Also a person who sees this activity on their address may also decide to turn the coins to the authorities untainting their address.

Tor/I2P are not just about illicit goods.
Consider services like Uber and AirBNB where something wasn't explicitly illegal but entrenched incumbents seeing those services, use the state to limit competition and the state cartelizes the market as a result.
In some places where there are so many laws it's impossible to know what is illegal to sell until the point your store is raided.
Other places where there is no explicit laws but law enforcement needs to be bribed.
It's also useful in protecting yourself against bad people who are not with the state that want to know where you keep your expensive items, or a neighbor from being able to know what goods you sell.

It's still a matter of risk and reversability and ultimately trust.

It doesn't even work the way they think it works. Miners can simply choose to run a fork, they can choose to not run what Core is selling everyone on.

Look at it this way as well, bitcoins sitting at a hackers address will be worth less then bitcoins sitting in a clean address. Why? Because even if you didn't do the hack yourself using those coins could flag you with authorities and raise questions in an investigation of the source of those coins. There are invisible costs in getting coins from a tainted address. It doesn't happen today because people and governments don't care yet, but bitcoin allows for this, and its something that can **allow for grades of coin based upon history of the associated addresses.**
@_date: 2016-04-25 19:27:55
Because you keep pretending coins are not tied to an address, the address allows you to grade a coin, be able to compare that coin to other coins (in another address) and from that be able to **discriminate against it. AKA not fungible!**
Fungibility ultimately isn't black and white (while you can compare pennies for scratches people don't care to) but its about how easy it is to discriminate one coin from another in a meaningful way, which you can do with bitcoin, its fungibility is simply sitting on the fact that people currently choose to not do it. Which again goes back to my original point that you haven't responded to which is that **fungibility isn't a feature of bitcoin.**
Comparatively there are other cryptocurrencies where fungibility is an intended feature because their history is made meaningless except to make sure new coins are not minted or double spent. And there are changes people are pushing for in Bitcoin to make it more fungible.
@_date: 2016-04-07 16:33:53
I see your point of view, I guess my hopes are still in finding a trustless exchange, which technically bitcoin isn't 'trustless' but rather trust in a blockchain and the nodes and the software they use to secure it.
@_date: 2016-04-26 22:41:57
Bitcoin Core can always fork the current blockchain with different proof of work algo, and use bootstrapping to force new wallets/nodes to connect with their nodes running their version of the blockchain. But I would expect a lot of DOS attacks like what was happening to classic. I would imagine such a move would also result in a lot of people dumping bitcoin as networking issues occur as a result, and not knowing which blockchain their transactions would end up on. It would be easier and less costly if they just created a new blockchain, an altcoin rather than trying to strong arm miners. So getting miners to cooperate is important to keep things running smoothly and that also means compromising.

What I find most inflammatory is what Allaire said himself which he quoted. Allaire should care about all potential customers, or at least pretend to, what he said doesnt come off as a good business man, not someone I would invest in, and certainly not if he also suggests lack of concern or frustration of bitcoin regulation by not caring about those who do. I would hope that businesses would concern themselves with regulation of their product, that those regulations are not destroying the product in the hands of their customers.

The way I understand it, instead of thinking of it as disbursing funds, they are disbursing vouchers (or service tokens). The more valuable of a service the DAC provides, the more valuable its vouchers will be. It also works like real shares, even if the service itself isn't fully realized (not every one is using bitcoins yet) the value can still rise as people demand the shares in anticipation of its full potential. So anyone holding vouchers is technically also a share holder. In the case of Bitcoin, miners are the workers that provide the service of that DAC.
Most of the DACs I've seen planned do not involve physical ends, most of them involve Internet services, like domain name allocation, messaging, search engines, etc.
Also note that it seems there are attempts to rename DAC, to Distributed Appplication, or Distributed Autonomous Community.
Anyway for the physical world, you might need a trusted third party. You can think of a DAC that hires independent agents to watch other people to make sure they are not cheating the system. It's very cyber punk to think about it this way, that a collection of computers, hires people to do tasks. But the question is, how does someone determine what is an independent agent or if that agent is part of a conspiracy.

I'm trying to organize my data to create an 8949, and I have a ton of small transactions.
Do I need to list every single bitcoin transaction? If yes, I notice that the on the 8949 the dates don't include hours:minutes:seconds, does it make sense to lump acquisitions together if they occurred on the same date? If yes would that include the case where they came from different sources (like from Coinbase, mining, faucets, etc)?
Another problem with this small transactions, many were for less than half a penny, so they become zero for proceeds and cost, which just looks funny to report.
Someone else told me that you used to be able to lump acquisitions together and say 'various' for the dates, but they don't know if that's true today.

I think one way to solve this, if nodes Alice and Bob have a contract and Alice is not connected when the contract expires, then Bob, who is connected, will generate and sign a transaction of the balance, and the network will store it and when Alice reconnects they can check if there are any pending transactions and sign them, this way Alice and Bob don't have to be connected at the same time. We can also say there is a transaction fee with the storage of these floating transactions.

My post is to get people to think about it, but I guess to contrast this with Bitcoins, credit cards and debit cards (checks) are not anonymous, which also makes them subject to identity theft/fraud. But by default you have no privacy for online purchases using those, with bitcoin at least you have a choice, a way to leave that system, at least as far as digital goods go and in store purchases.
I do have to wonder though, what is our privacy worth, what is the bounty they have on our privacy and where does this bounty come from. I can't imagine it being solely advertisement, advertisement already knows our purchasing behaviour with out knowing who we are. But not only do they have to contend with competing with those who are willing to not charge us for anonymity, but that tracking/securing identities itself is not free. Anonymity should be cheaper and free, and yet they somehow have made it into a cost. I would not be surprised if there was not some sort of government subsidy that has resulted in an increase in the bounty on our privacy.
Anyway, bitcoin is a way to escape this in the online world, provided our networks afford us privacy as well, or something like tor is used.

There is cyclical activity in a fully functional currency (instead of a inflationary currency), if people exchange too much, the value of Bitcoin goes down and people stop exchanging with it, reduction in exchanges increases the value of Bitcoin and attracts more vendors (vendors see a lot of value held by Bitcoin users and want a piece of it).
If we want more people to use Bitcoin it needs to be easier to acquire, saving and spending are not bottlenecks in growing the user base at this point in time.

Value is subjective. If someone wants to charge $1 million for a ball of poop, it doesn't matter if people would pay that much for it, the person who owns it values it the most and they choose what it's worth to them.

It was a good book, but he over uses inductive reasoning. If you bother doing a study why not ask the participants why they behaved the way they did, why try to work backwards from the results. It's likely because in those studies they expect people to not know why they behaved the way they did, in other words they expect people to be irrational, so of course they get what they are looking for. It's also ironic that they try to say presentation affects people's attitudes and yet in their studies they don't mention in detail how they presented things to their participants, or how they work these things out of the study, and its easy to see that for example, some one could think its a test/contest and behave differently then if they think its paid, under paid, or unpaid labor.

Well obviously you wouldn't want it by default to return to anyone, it will require both Alice and Bob to put money in escrow, and both to sign a transaction to release the funds. They would have to agree on a balance based on who gave the most bandwidth to the other. If they can't agree at the end of the contract, both will have lost the money.

I wouldn't say they have a leftist disregard for property rights, they just have a different idea on what property rights are. Saying 'property rights' is not the same as saying 'private property ownership'.
I think all libertarians would agree with homesteading of unowned land. And I think in principle they would all agree that its wrong if a king or government would declare a title to the land to an individual who was not involved in homesteading it and did not negotate with those who did before receiving title. Where they would differ is on what it means when someone has a title to land and hires others to work on that land.

Wow, such language, no reason to get angry.
Researchers make mistakes, and others who misinterpret the results make the mistake even more significant. I was drinking soda in an elevator one time, and some dude said "you know that stuff dissolves your bones right?", and he went on to tell me why and I believed him but I forgot the reason he told me and I wanted to look it up and I found out it was an urban myth caused by two studies. The first study showed that soda can prevent absorption of calcium and the other study showed that people who drink soda regularly had lower bone density than those who didn't. The first study was done in a controlled environment and was never proven to have occurred at any significant level in the intestine, and the second study was flawed because it didn't take into account that people who drink soda were offsetting calcium in their diet, drinking soda instead of coffee or milk. There has also been some research on the bias of research:


Sure, but where does the book point this out, for that matter where do you point this out? It seems you, just like him, were just picking parts that suited your world view. I mean this is what you pointed out from the book:


Obviously that's not universal or generally true, especially if you then have to back pedal when presented with a scenario where it isn't true.
There are places to eat that you are not served but people come by to clean up, those places generally don't require tipping, but I doubt they would get insulted if someone left something.
That chapter in the book itself has the appearance of contradictory things in it. I mean in one case when he says parents are fined for being tardy picking up their kids, the parents did it more often as a result, where as in his imaginary scenario the guy who bounces a check gets angry at the bank for fining him. It's contradictory in the way he presents it in the book but you could easily argue that the difference is in how much the fine is, and I'd agree but no where does he explicitly say this.
Value is subjective and it changes quickly depending on the context. Even with bitcoin, everyone has a different idea in their head how much they are worth, that is why in exchanges everyone has different bid and ask prices. So even if you imagine that a gift is the cash equivalent using market value, that may not represent their immediate subjective value of something. If you ask friends to help you move and they work up an appetite, they are more likely to value food and water more than money at that moment, so they would probably be fine if you just bought them lunch. So yes, if someone needs money they are going to appreciate a cash tip more than a cash equivalent gift.

Technically its not the debt implosion, its malinvestment and market correction. If someone takes out a loan to invest in a business or buy a house, if they fail to pay and default, you end up with resources that get put up back in the market, the house, labor (employees), factories, equipment, etc. those resources were allocated incorrectly and the market corrects by moving them to a better place, the deflation is that you suddenly have an increase in supply and decrease in demand.
Under normal market conditions these occur but they are irregular, its when you homogenize the market, through government intervention, does the risk increase of simultaneous collapse.

Bitcoin (currency) may today represent some of the things you describe, but ultimately it belongs to the mining pool operators and what they decide to do with it. Their decisions will be to their favor, which will only remain a mutual favor for everyone in an environment where people have alternative choices. If Bitcoins were made legal while alt coins are made illegal, you create an environment where mining pool operators and any organization that represents them could make decisions that are not favorable to everyone else, that are favorable to existing operators and governments but unfavorable to everyone else. That is a pattern that happens time and again, from farming to taxi cabs.
The best thing that could happen for everyone is creation of infrastructure that is currency neutral, and easy to exchange, allowing for a wider variety of crypto currencies and alternative proof of work algorithms. In fact, it makes sense to me that most businesses provide service crypto tokens and people may use those as currency (like Mpesa), retention of value, or as stocks in a business.

And while many countries have democracies, they fail to capture what the public would really like, people end up making lots of compromises.

If someone says something is a link to anime but its actually childporn is fraud, but if other users can flag things as misleading or tag them as what they actually are, then other users have a choice to avoid them. There are ways to avoid or reduce abuse of censorship, and that is for more users to look at unfiltered content and rate them for others, validate ratings/tags.

I feel like this would only apply to solo mining and mining pool operators (and maybe p2p mining) since there is no real middlemen between you and the first created bitcoins.

They are not gift cards and they don't give you credits for buying things, so you are not forced to spend money in their store, they literally just give you access to certain discounts listed on their store shelves. You have to sign up for them which usually means giving them your name and phone number and email address, and usually if you forget your card you can give them your phone number and they can find you in their database so you can get the discount.

There are no incentives to running nodes is one problem, other cryptocurrencies have alternative solutions to that problem. The only ones incentivized to run nodes are miners (which is being consolidated by ASICs) and websites that are funded by various means (advertisement, promotion of products/services, etc).
As far as alt coins go, Dash pay for example attracts a lot of people to get paid to run master nodes and even being allowed to vote on issues.
And if you look at something like storj.io (not a currency but a service) you can also see that people are flocking towards an idea that running a server in their homes can make them extra money:  so there interest in people doing that.
I'm not saying Bitcoin should do that, but structurally there are other reasons why nodes drop off as costs running a node increase.

It was to prevent DOS attacks not spam. "Spam" is a relative term, you can declare buying 'a latte with bitcoin' as "spam", but intentionally flooding the network to take it down is an attack which is what they wanted to prevent.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:00:34


Yes but those are not useful nodes in terms of decentralization. And following what you say here strictly, and what you said earlier, it would mean that 'nodes dropping off' translates to 'users dropping off' which we know is not the case.


Yes but then there is no easy way for a user to know or measure trustlessness of the system to know if more nodes are needed. Or how much a difference their node makes, its not tangible, as you say.
But anyway, what you are describing is structurally produces a public goods problem which most government/centralization proponents use as to why we need government intervention. That is the benefits of doing a thing are not as high as the cost of doing it on an individual basis, and you end up with free riders who use the system but don't contribute (SPV nodes). Government proponents say you need government to do those kinds of things and to do them by taxing.


You could easily argue that everyone else's transactions are a disincentive to running a node, while your transactions are the only incentive to run a node (which you actually did say above). And I think this greatly fits in with the 'bitcoin is not about coffee' meme, that we should only use it for very special transactions (my transactions and not yours).


You shouldn't need to have that many connections to that many other nodes, especially if there were already many other full nodes running that could reduce the load on your network. And for those who do run a node being paid would mean subsidizing a faster and higher limit internet connection, maybe even a static IP.
The same problems exist for those who use BitTorrent and other unincentivized file sharing systems, its why 'seeders' drop off and disappear once they all have downloaded the file. It's also why I think incentivized systems like storj will eventually replace them
There is another solution to this problem, and that is using other cryptocurrencies, and to borrow from Keonne, all the other cryptocurrencies are about doing what Bitcoin says you can't do.
@_date: 2016-03-08 00:05:14
We can look at it this way. If for some reason we can't buy a latte with our mobile phones with Bitcoin, well Keonne Rodriguez says its not about that, so accordingly we shouldn't care. But being able to buy stuff that they say you can't, like illegal drugs from Silk Road, that fits in perfect with what Keonne Rodriguez said. Clarity is in the details of what he meant and not in some meaningless twitter catch phrase.

It's also economically inefficient to have to distribute a blockchain, and to not have a strongly trusted centralized authority, but theoretical economic efficiency can't quantify the cost of security and stability when things go wrong (and they do go wrong from time to time!) and of trust harvesting (building a reputation and destroying that reputation to profit).

It seems to me there is a lot of arbitrary magic numbers in bitcoins implementation, block size and fees for example.
There is a public goods / free rider problem, that is, there are lots of people benefiting at the expense of others, because costs don't directly connect with network use, node operators are not paid for distributing the ever growing blockchain for example.

Yes but that is theory. You can say the same thing about Proof of Work in regard to attack vectors (like 51% attack etc), the question isn't if they can be gamed at all but how difficult and risky would it be to do it. Most Proof of Stake coins for example focus on making it difficult and risky rather then impossible to game their systems.
But both Sia and storj have to deal with these kinds of scenarios of cheating nodes, you can read a debate regarding how they both are trying to solve this:

Technically he was asked if he had proof **Satoshi** ran 50 nodes, and his response was there was no proof of that but only that the data suggests it. Which to me means there is evidence of &gt;= 51% control but not necessarily that Satoshi was responsible. And asking why Satoshi would have 50 nodes is to say he would have the most motive for doing it in those times.
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:52:31


It depends on what you mean by 'work with bitcoin nodes'.


Like I said there are other cryptocurrencies that are doing it now and as far as I know they don't have that problem. But most of them are using staking, it limits faking nodes because a node need to process transaction blocks to stake. Dash pay is one of the few that does both Proof of Work for census and staking in nodes to receiving income from running a node. Then you have Peercoin which is pure Proof of Stake, followed by Nova coin and all its forked coins (Clam coin, Black coin, etc). Ethereum is planning to move to Proof of Stake, and they plan to a new and interesting (Game Theory based) Proof of Stake algorithm but I am not sure of their incentive structures for running nodes.
But in terms of 'working with bitcoin nodes', I would say, if you are referring to getting Bitcoin Core/Classic to adopt something new, I would wholeheartedly agree that there are no viable solutions in that regard. That is if we desired for example to change the the mining algorithm it would be impossible and maybe unfair to change  that given how much miners are invested in bitcoin, and so the idea of splitting fees between miners and node operators would be just as remotely impossible as that.

No one is forcing anyone to do anything, you're free to bet all your money on one race horse if you like taking big risks.
You're also free to eat nothing but cheetos, wear the same clothes everyday.
You might also ask, why do we need so many nodes, why not just have a single trusted node that serves all transactions.
Also consider this, if we colonize mars, how will we sync bitcoin across the sun at a speed where miners on Mars and Earth can compete fairly and you don't run into 51% attacks when Mars and Earth are close enough, and double spends when they are far apart?
Cryptocurrencies have scalability issues beyond just what we see today, scalability issues that can be solved by just having many of them rather than a single one.

They don't have to, again, what is "spam" is relative, even more so with Bitcoin because of the definition of spam:


A transaction that gets sent to a large number of node operators by that definition, being irrelevant to a node operator is "spam", but even if you don't think that is the case in the general sense of the Bitcoin community, then consider that some do feel [Bitcoin isn't about buying lattes]( meaning using Bitcoin to buy a latte should be **irrelevant** which again fits in the above definition of being considered "spam". I've seen others here also say that Bitcoin should not try to compete with Visa, so any non-essential/inappropriate transactions can be considered spam.

Not forgetting that governments assassinate far more people on earth than any market could possible achieve.
And it should be noted, in the beginning, there were Libertarians against Bitcoin, some even calling it a scam, most of them saying Gold is safer, and some interpreting Menger-Mises Regression Theorem as saying Bitcoin was unsafe as not having intrinsic value.

Yes but many people trust them regardless. For online banking, accessing exchanges, shopping, email and accessing their medical records. They have browsers memorize their passwords and credit card numbers and home addresses. The standards are intentionally make it hard for hackers but also make it hard for developers in many cases.


I have not heard of Rein, it sounds like a cool project.
I've also considered having a master key to reduce the possibility of weakening a key to brute force hacking by signing a key multiple times. And of course you could then have one delegate key per device, one for your mobile phone, one for your desktop computer, etc. The problem was if you lose that master key then you lose your online identity.
The idea of having your identity in escrow is that a private key isn't your identity, your identity is like a satoshi it can be transferred from key to key. So I'd imagine it working like bitcoin multisig transactions, but maybe with slightly different rules. The control key, the private key you control and can use for different things associated with your identity, it can transfer your identity to another control key but when in an escrow it can't change the other keys by itself, for the other keys to be changed they would require 2 or more signatures (depending on how much security is wanted). So for example, Bob could put his identity in escrow with his parents keys, if his key is later compromised he could create an identity transaction to transfer his identity to his new key and then contact his parents so they can use their keys to sign/validate the transaction. If later Bob wants to add his girlfriend Alice to the escrow, he would create a transaction adding her to the escrow and get one of his parents to sign it. He could also add friends, his boss, his future children, or others he trusts to the escrow, and he can also remove them. There could also be firms that specialize in identity protection services that could be used, for like celebrities or others who need the extra protection.

What about just having ways of digitally signing content from a web browser using cryptography like what is used by bitcoin. This way a website could generate a bitcoin transaction and send it to the browser the user reviews it and then tells the browser to sign it.
This would allow also for other things besides payment/transactions, stuff like using a private key for messaging/chatting/social media, etc. The public key is basically your identity in the bitcoin network, and your private key is how you identify your actions. In this way bitcoin creates accountless banking (you don't have to sign up for anything), why not use the same tech to create an accountless web?!

To be clear, no power is spent confirming a block after it has been confirmed once. The number of confirmations just means how many other confirmed blocks are stacked on top of the block your looking at. The deeper that block is (the more confirmed blocks stacked on top), the harder it would be to replace that block, which means if someone tried to do a double spend attack with a forked blockchain they would need to beat the other confirmed blocks as well.

LOL, you are talking about the govt here. The whole thing is pointless anyway, how many other non-US based mining hardware businesses behave like Butterfly labs except no FTC. Like KnCMiner for example, people complained about dust being in their miners (as if they had been mining for some time). Some businesses actually also sell you hardware that was used for mining, and make you wait until they upgrade their miners before they send it to you as a 'pre-order'.
Anyway mining is not profitable for the average joe today, it's profitability is completely based on the rise in value of bitcoin, you are better off buying bitcoin and holding, you will end up with more bitcoins than you would buying hardware and mining.
Mine because you want bitcoins that are not traceable back to your bank... mine because you don't want the network to be centralized... but mining for profit is only possible if your power is cheap and you have the latest hardware.

A plugin will not be as adopted as a web standard, plus the one I am thinking of had a centralized component, that is you needed to have an account with some website to make use of their plugin.
And while there is a [web standard for cryptography]( it lacks a protected way for users to store and use private keys independent of a website and it does not support the same cryptography used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
I am hoping that something like the Brave browser will integrate something like this, but they also seem to be only targeting payments.
With bitcoin today you don't need a newegg account you don't need a credit card account to buy from newegg, it would be a different world if you didn't need a reddit account, a twitter account, a facebook account, a google account, etc, rather you had an identity in a block chain that can be used to make sure you are not a spammer, and being to interact with people on different websites without needing to have an account with the website.

They can't deviate that much, the closer you get to the final image the deviations should be minor. For example you can imagine needing to do 100 iterations of redrawing a frame, one node does 50 and the other does the other 50, blending the results of their work you should not see as much deviation. That is strictly for high quality settings for lower quality settings can expect greater deviations. And even so there are ways of predicting how much deviation to expect in different areas of the image, for example areas where you get specular reflections you can expect larger deviations. Photon mapping for example has been used backwards from the camera in determining how to distribute photons to focus on areas more likely to be visible from the camera. It doesn't make sense then to focus on redrawing areas that are already smooth and to focus on areas that have the most noise, so knowing where there will be the most deviation has several benefits which would include validating if an image is in range. You could have it as well that the more deviation between two images, the images get rejected and the nodes have to continue working on them until that deviation is minimized, this would improve the quality of the image as well as make sure that a node isn't cheating.

Your assuming interest rates are not artificial and there are not other policies affecting lending. And just because interest rates are low it doesn't mean you can actually borrow money, other policies affect lending. But negative interest rates means no one will want to have money in the bank, and if they can't pull the money out in cash they will spend it on other things, that will drive up demand for those things and create inflation.
@_date: 2016-02-10 23:57:13
That is true, but it also doesn't mean banks are lending money either as other policies can reduce lending.
@_date: 2016-02-11 03:36:46
By artificial I mean the prices are not driven by the market but rather by manipulation.


Money can only *breed* money if a loan is paid back, if a loan is defaulted then money is lost. Interest is simply the rent of money.
In a normal functioning market if a lot of people are saving rather than spending, interest rates go down, just as it would be if there are more people competing to rent bicycles, there is more money to lend. It also means people are not interested in buying things today, which means lending the money to businesses to develop products they would be interested in spending their savings on. When people are spending rather than saving, interest rates go up, people are not thinking about the future so there is less reason to invest in businesses to develop future products or build factories, etc, but general prices go up (more deman) so businesses don't need loans anyway.
This is not what we have today. Today the fed creates and dumps new money on the market affecting interest rates and the value of the currency, sending the wrong signal to businesses, investors, and consumers. This makes some businesses seem successful when they are really failing. And that new money is more likely to end up in the hands of the wealthy, expanding their wealth when really in this economy they should be losing wealth, and actually they are but they are merely unrealized losses that will be realized when everyone panics and tries spending their fiat wealth, competing to escape their losses.

You can only have that if every node is identical/homogeneous, otherwise you need to understand the quality of the node, even for something as simple as how long it will take to do the work. You can for example also have several slow nodes making a nasty bottleneck in the service, not just the case of malicious nodes. You might have network performance issues to consider, sending lots of textures and large datasets might be slow if you are sending to lots of nodes instead of fewer faster nodes, some nodes may be fast at rendering but their network speed is slow, some might have faster network speeds but slow render times.


I agree, as I said in my comment if there is a lot of trust harvesting it will make it harder on newcomers.


Yes but in their own FAQ they state:




How can there be a *trusted group* if they are anonymous.
Also from the FAQ:




So you have an identity, and that means the BitWrk service can keep a track of the reputation of that identity if it so chose to at a future date and this is how they can identify their *trusted group*.

It needs a reputation system, which would work because it's centralized. Your workers market value will be based on its reputation.
Even the Brave browser is going to deal with this problem by having you certify your bitcoin address with BitGo. Reduce the likelyhood of bot farming ad revenue.
Of course you could end up with a scenario where people merely have bots that do trust harvesting, build trust and then destroy it for a profit. In such scenarios it becomes harder on newcomers, the cost of doing free work in the beginning will pay for verification/certification, and overtime those costs go down as less verification is used. This would make the value of a reputation worth more than harvesting it.

That deflation article is kind of misleading. It is not a prediction to say QE is *monetary* inflation, QE **is** *monetary* inflation. It would of course be a prediction to say QE will cause *price* inflations. Many economist who talk about *monetary* policy, when they say inflation they mean *monetary* inflation not *price* inflation. So when the article talks about 'inflation hawks' who the hell are they talking about? How about names and their articles? By not saying who these 'inflation hawks' are, the writer made themselves a **strawman** to knock down, so that anyone who uses the word *inflation* must be one of those crazy 'inflation hawks'.
Monetary inflation is dangerous irregardless of its short term effects. You can think of it as stock piling missiles, arming banks and the elite with the ability to dump lots of capital in the market and destroy value for those holding money. And as I recall it is a policy (I don't recall if it is from the Fed or some regulation) that has made banks tighten lending (reduce velocity), so banks are in essence now being told to stock pile money, all it takes is a change in policy to essentially nuke the economy / open Pandora's box and destroy the value of the dollar in various ways. It is yet another weapon in their arsenal.
Of course it will not necessarily play out that way, it could be that the policy is to prepare for lend to businesses that will be impacted by the coming minimum wage hike, businesses that in order to stay competitive will take out loans to reduce the impact of a price hikes on their customers. To spread the inflation over years instead of immediately destroying the economy. Of course it is still a dangerous game to play, with changing politicians and bureaucrats who may decide to change policies, or find reason to make the stock pile even bigger and more dangerous.

That is defensive language, to which they may or may not mean it, but in either case it works out to their defense when they end up using their craft in injuring another. And in either case, if someone is willing to say such a thing you dont want to f with them, it means they are willing to defend their actions.


A collective/group does have its own violence, and what stirs that violence more than inequality? Inequality definitely brings violence, not just in terms of jealousy, but also in the general disparity of a powerful person using that power to attack a weaker person, when a mob of people is more powerful than the attacker. Its almost a machismo thing, where a mob must express its power over the individual, when the individual tries to express its power over another.

Great so security is a zero issue, but you're arguing against yourself here.

When people talk about dividing up the pie (like socialist, egalitarians, etc), they are arguing that it is a zero sum game, that resources are finite, and they ignore that the pie is constantly expanding, not necessarily in quantity but also in what can be done with it (which could be argued that is infinite but that is beyond this discussion). They are letting current limits make policies that don't grow the pie and instead enforce the limits and even retard growth. In your case you are arguing for things that could make bitcoin less valuable, and not in the sense you are talking about in the video, you make good arguments about oracles but you assume that censorship would only be used for that purpose!

Okay if that were true, what would happen if blocksize were unlimited and all coins mined and really low tx fees? Obviously hashing power would be directed towards other things, including attacking bitcoin via 51% attack. So obviously fees need to be high enough to attract hashing power toward enforcing a single blockchain. You might argue that block size is not unlimited but for sidechains it might as well be since they will likely not likely be filling blocks. Also even with bitcoin, blocks being full is rare, and has bad consequences long term.


Yes, but now sidechains are limited to bitcoin style mining. You can't experiment with litecoin or dashpay type algorithms, or proof of stake, etc. I mean, you can, but like I said transaction fees are not subsidized, so the main blockchain has an advantage.

@_date: 2016-05-18 02:24:48
That thread isn't arguing against what I said in the beginning, but I do see its relevance to what we are talking about now in regards to no blocksize limit.
That thread though in essence is discussing how bitcoin security would be paid for via transaction fees, and the solution the OP thought was most realistic was that a tx limit would 'artificially' raise the transaction fees to attract enough hashing power to secure the network.
But our original discussion was whether the subsidy gives the main blockchain an advantage over sidechains, and that seems to me to still be the case. In the case of the sidechain they would need to raise their transaction fees enough to secure their networks because they don't have the subsidy, and based upon that thread, a strategy to do that would be to have an even smaller tx limit than the main blockchain to force users to compete for space in a block.
That is actually a really good thread, it is really enlightening. Thanks for sharing it!

That assumes miners income will only be from mining bitcoins, and will not come from this new power of censorship (income which doesn't itself have to be in bitcoins).

That is true! Bitcoin was born centralized. And sure things could have been done differently, and Satoshi made decisions to what he thought would make Bitcoin more valuable (such as denying double spends, setting a 21 million coin limit). Again, I'm not arguing if Bitcoin should work a particluar way, I'm saying there are downsides to having power to arbitrarily censor, and preventing invalid transactions isn't arbitrary and not equivalent. Miners wil censor to what is best for them and not necessarily what is best for Bitcoin as a whole, especially if what would be best for bitcoin is to diminish the power and dependence of miners. It definitely doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin, but will just limit its growth and perpetuate currency wars, which are bad for everyone since it creates an environment of booms and busts since coins can't travel across blockchains and require exchanges. Allows room for the Androids of the world (install any app you want) to compete with the iPhones/iPads (walled app garden).

Well it essential says it doesn't matter if miners think they would be better with higher purchasing power, they can still make poor decisions focusing on short term gains and ruining the, often harder to see, long term. You can have prisoner dilemma style "market failure" where an individual cheats the group thinking it won't hurt but then everyone has a similar plans and they are all worse off as a result.

Honestly now that I have multiple cryptocurrencies, it doesn't matter to me either. Marketshare only really matters to those centralizing their portfolio on one cryptcurrency.

Just as if we were talking about fumble with Apple in their iPhone we would also look at how that plays out in their marketshare of smartphones, how end users respond.


That's the hope at least. LN helps match features of sharding on Ethereum and the way Safe network divides things across nodes. Don't get me wrong I like SegWit and LN, as well as other features being worked on for privacy. I'm just a little on the skeptical side with Core and their timing.

Bitcoin users can't themselves decide what transactions are accepted in a block, that is decided by hashing power of the miner, but a user can decide to move their coins to a sidechain, which you are arguing should be censored.
Also Bitcoin decisions about transactions are random! That is like if one bitcoin miner is chosen to decide if a sidechain is accepted or not, but then the next miner gets to make the same choice! That is why censorship is hard in bitcoin, and it is not really democracy since a minority can still get their way, it will just take time.

Yes **right now** since the **cost of mining** isn't paid for via tx fee. But what is going to pay for mining when mining returns nothing? Miners are not going to do it for free.


Yes but even before all bitcoins are mined, mining will produce almost nothing in bitcoins. After all there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins mined.
So what you are saying then is that bitcoin would just become insecure, that they would not try to raise the tx fee to cover mining costs to improve network security? Is that really what you think would happen?
Again, a transaction fee is not necessarily just used to pay to get your transaction into the blockchain. Especially in a case where you can't mine/mint new coins.
@_date: 2016-05-18 05:28:45


Yes, and I was definitely using the word 'fees' more loosely than I should have.
So I'm not trying to say security costs directly increase tx fees (as causation), but that, minus a subsidy, things must be done to artificially increase tx fees to attract enough mining power to reduce risk of attacks/centralization.
And with that said, sidechains (ones that don't use merged mining), will be at a disadvantage not having a subsidy to cover costs of preventing centralization/attacks, and will need to artificially increase their tx fees or be less secure then the main blockchain.

I just realized another flaw in sidechains with Bitcoin that I will mention, and that is, the core blockchain is the only one that has the right to mine/mint the remaining coins, creating an incentive for its own security and making securing sidechains with different consensus algorithms more expensive and needing higher transaction fees. That is why altcoins make more sense then sidechains, they can also use inflation to create an incentive for node operators to secure their networks.

The finite resource argument (zero sum game) is used a lot and it is never correct. Take oil for example, we have kept hearing about peak oil forever, but it has not happened, and the reason is because we keep finding new efficient ways of extracting oil, processing oil, and using oil, that creates a virtual expansion of oil as a resource. And that is just looking at a single resource, looking at the bigger picture across several sources of energy you see the same thing.
Another popular argument is that of thermal dynamics, but the problem with that is again we will find more efficient ways of using existing energy. For example if we figure out a way to digitize humans, those humans would be made more efficient, require less resources, and they may even exist in a different time frame, where time might travel faster for them, but also as the universe loses its energy and becomes cold, as the super computer that has a bunch of humans in it loses power, it will simply slow down, but the human beings inside would not know, since the the speed at which their neurons fire in their brain and the speed the clock they are staring at moves, are moving at the same rate, so they will never perceive the universe slowing down, they will never perceive that thermal dynamics end of universe.

Not necessarily, not when money is printed because there is more wealth in the world it can redeem. One of the main reasons they say they print money is to counter deflation. That is the wealth in the world is growing but the money supply isn't. Of course if they print more money when the wealth is in decline then they are causing inflation and can lead to hyper inflation. The other problem with money printing is that it distorts the market by giving the newly created money to people who did not earn it, like using it to prop up a failing business model which in turn hurts those that use a better business model, **or in the case you describe prop up a failing government that should be replaced by a better one.**
Anyway, the book ["The Bubble that broke the world"]( written in 1931, basically characterize the stock market crash and the great depression that followed as being that too many people trusted Germany and bought bonds, creating a debt bubble that broke the world.

Interesting, I didn't know this. So land value tax is not the same as property tax, in that it removes any economic incentives of the state to intentionally create housing bubbles in order to gain more tax revenue. And also relative to income tax which creates incentives in a city to try and pack as many people in its jurisdiction to increase income tax revenue (favoring apartments, condos, over houses).

I would say you are right, it is in bitcoin cores interest to work that way but it is not necessarily the interest of bitcoin users, but in the end that is okay because bitcoin users can just, jump ship to an altcoin. The problem with that is, ultimately it hurts the value of bitcoin, creates booms and busts as people move from altcoin to altcoin. It would then be better if bitcoin were decentralized with regard to sidechains!

I would say not. Bitcoin lost value and altcoins went up in value.

Double spends are invalid transactions, they are algorithmically verifiable and transparent, you might as well be asking if I think malformed transactions should be censored, or random garbage in a block should be allowed. If a sidechain is in someway invalid and can be verified automatically with an algorithm that is publicly visible, then there is no problem, the algorithm itself can be criticized by engineers, bugs can be found, exploits can be fixed, etc. But a whitelist is entirely different because what does and does not end up in a whitelist need not be transparent as to why. You might consider it as having a whitelist of accepted bitcoin addresses, needing to register your address for miners to add it to the whitelist.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:31:08

You need wealth accumulation to stabilize an economy. Think about it as an electronic circuit, imagine you have an unstable energy source (like a solar panel) that will give you more energy than you need at times, and less energy than you need at other times, the only way to prevent damage to your circuit or prevent it from shutting down and to produce a stable/consistent amount of energy for it is to put a capacitor or battery between your energy source and the circuit. In the same way wealth accumulation allows you to smooth out natural instability in an economy.
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:39:10


That doesn't answer the question of what you mean by "so not allowing bad actors to seriously limit Bitcoin's value"


Stability is when most of those on the market are mostly trying to sip away growth. Litecoin is a good [example]( there are those who are slowly reducing their massive holdings by eating any growth that comes along, while trying not to destroy the value of their holdings.


Sorry, that is SJCX, storj.io.


How do you know any of this? It would increase costs of their attacks, much like fees, and yet the attacks have stopped!


No, I am talking percentage wise across [all cryptocurrencies]( There were zero other cryptocurrencies when it started so even a cap of zero would be 100% of total cryptocurrency market cap.


That could be the case, but that is not why I started moving on. I started moving on when my own transactions were being held up, when I saw some online stores stop accepting bitcoins because of "network issues".


I don't disagree except for the disruptive nature of the method of making this happen.

Markets don't lie. It dropped in relative market cap [amongst all crytocurrencies]( in fact it hit the lowest point it has ever been just after blocks became full!

It isn't just costs of mining, to repeat what I said earlier, your economics neglects that the payment has to be high enough to attract hashing power to enforce a single (unforked) blockchain. And there are other uses of such hashing power, one of which is also to attack the network. So yeah, hashing power is diverted, difficulty adjusts but then that means it takes less power to attack the network. This is the cost of security, enough hashing power to prevent a 51% attack. Basically bitcoin mining has to pay enough to attract at least 50% of the *effective* hashing power of the entire world. You might also assume new asics no longer need to be developed, but that is also wrong, because a new asic concentrates more power into fewer hands (just as it is doing today!), and if bitcoin doesn't pay enough to cover the cost of proliferating power of new asics then it could also be used against bitcoin.
You can also consider a case of having an altcoin that uses the same hashing algorithm but subsidizes mining better. In such a scenario miners could switch to the new coin, which if both coins don't split hashing power, who ever has less power is less secure. If one coin pays less than the other (regardless of subsidy) they will effectively lose hashing power to the other.
Also in simpler terms its an arms race that must be paid for!

Some games also don't have the limitation in their TOS, or they provide other mechanisms which allow indirect conversion of currencies. But some of these game companies are not based in the US either.
Also some games you can buy and sell virtual goods with both real and virtual currency, both currencies are used for the same purpose in this respect. Diablo 3 is one such game:

The main benefit to these prints is that it's easier to hide than something like gold. Like hiding them in books, DVDs, Video Game cases, etc. it's also created offline in a self contained system so there isn't the possibility of malware or thieves stealing information from your computer or printer by restoring data you deleted.
It also comes with a version of electrum that can print wallets and can print the seed (encrypted or unencrypted). That is extremely useful in my opinion. If my paper wallets go bad, then I can always use the seed to restore them, and if the seed is encrypted I'm not as concerned with where I store them. I can also take the printed encrypted seed and transfer to another medium that will last longer, the main benefit being that it was generated by an offline computer. Only downside is that I had to manually set up a ram drive so that electrum didn't store the seed to the SD card, I wish it automatically did that.

I think it's interesting that everyone is focusing on encryption as the weak point when there is another possible way that quantum computers could kill/hurt bitcoin using a 51% attack. A 51% attack would in theory be easier to do than trying to decrypt individual keys.
Encryption could be made harder and even if the asymmetry of encrypting and breaking a key are made narrower, that just makes it into more of a cat and mouse game and involves moving bitcoins around more often and paying even more to miners in transactions, these transactions fees from all the motion will entice quantum computers to be used for mining and could eventually result in an attempt at a 51% attack.
Even today, looking at ASICMiner, they are hovering around 25% of hashing power!

No matter how I look at it in a spreadsheet over the long haul of 5 blocks, honest miners have better odds that approach 55%.
Try creating a probability diagram of the different possible results and then look at the odds of having more honest blocks than selfish blocks.
One difficulty I am having is that the last block can be in limbo since no blockchain has won yet, but if I exclude it for potentially being in limbo and look at the results of the previous blocks there is no advantage of the selfish mining strategy.

The rather downside to it would be that the prints have a minimum life expectancy of 7 years before they fade, provided they are kept in cool storage conditions.

Steve Horwitz explains this better than I do:
But we did see inflation, that inflation became trapped in the housing market and is also now accumulating in student loans. It takes time before employees start asking for raises because the house they purchase is more expensive than it should be.
Part of this is that general inflation usually occurs from interest rates, but they made interest rates lower than inflation! That means wealth is being taken from savings accounts to be used to create mortgages that get used as securities on the market. That means you either put your money in the stock market or you use your money to leverage a big loan, your debt will shrink due to inflation being higher than the interest on it!
Eventually this will hit the general market, it's only a matter of time, they are only delaying market correction, by distorting it even more.

They're competing with their own hardware through total hashing power (ASICMiner the mining company versus ASICMiner the seller of mining hardware) not through the price of the hardware, but I suppose there may be other reasons they sell hardware as opposed to just mine, like maybe they are maximized on their local resources (electricity, etc) and so selling hardware allows them to expand past these limitations.

Not if you include the cost of the hardware and the fact that difficulty is always increasing (more than doubled in the last month and a half).
I myself am getting less BTC mined because difficulty has increased which is a result of the rise of ASICs in the network, which means less BTC for everyone mining. We all are probably getting half the BTC that we were getting a few months back.
I have bought mining hardware recently but the prices are ridiculous now, the ROIs are not worth it, even with the price cuts of the ASICMiner Erupter with the current trend of difficulty, ROI is heading toward 2 years especial when you consider the drop in USD/BTC. Butterfly Labs preorders were cheaper earlier this year and now are doubled in price. Avalon had a huge jump in price for their second batch preorders also.
Of course this doesn't take into account the fact that ASICMiner builds its own hardware and provides about 25% of the hashing power, they probably get the hardware a lot cheaper. But they will still struggle with competing with their own hardware they sell for hashing power but that is why their hardware ROI is so ridiculous, you are basically paying them more than what they would have mined with that hardware. They also have share holders that they pay and it's really a matter if that group of people will spend their BTC or hoard it, they don't have hardware or electricity costs.
@_date: 2013-07-22 02:44:52
I agree with questioning claims that it won't reach ROI. For me to stop mining (due to the cost of electricity), difficulty will have to increase over 34 times with an average price per BTC of $75, if the price of BTC doubles then the difficulty can go up 68 times higher and I can still mine.
People can argue that buying BTC would have been a better investment, but that overlooks the point that you can reach ROI, and a person can and should do both! I have way more invested in BTC then I do in the hardware to mine it. But by mining I reduce the profits of other miners who would dump their BTC on the market and kill the price.

There is a 45% chance of the 'selfish' pool creating the first block, but they must win the second block to also win the first, and while they have an 85% chance of winning the second block, they also have a 15% of losing both blocks, that gives them a total chance of winning the first block a 0.45*0.85=0.3825 or 38.25% chance, that looks to me to be a disadvantage.

There were completely delusional people, not greedy people, telling people the housing market was strong and going to continue to grow. Do a search on YouTube for Peter Schiff was right, there are a collection of videos where he was warning about the housing bubble and many of them didn't believe him and made their own claims based upon research.


Research isn't useful, research isn't the same as insider information. Most of the research I have ever read is to go for the long haul and ignore the short term, and only put your money in things that you would buy or need (human needs, etc). But that is generic.
For bitcoin, its a technology, investment in it, is to build software that uses it. Research is to get some and buy stuff with it and see how it works.


Yeah but how did Joe Schmoe get the money to buy something who couldn't really afford? Banks! Not individuals holding bitcoin or gold.


That is why I said 'usually' there isn't always pure centralized planning, some governments that understand the benefits of a free market, use them to an advantage but even then they may give some market actors advantages over others handicapping it.
There are also some that don't fail because they use propaganda and they create labor camps/prisons, they are very brutal and violent to their people and will let them die then to allow trade.

The main reason people should look at growth of BTC value is whether mining hardware will ever reach ROI.
The only way you would stop mining is if mined BTCs value is less then the value of the electricity to mine it.

There is no such thing as group rationality. You're still talking about individual rationality, which is made more obvious when you said this:


Really what you're talking about is morality of those with the most power. If the largest amount of Ghz is used immorally than bitcoin can lose its utility and lose its value.
It can be an example of tragedy of commons. But also some nefarious organization with the intention of destroying bitcoin could use the same mechanisms, it doesn't have to necessarily happen as a result of individual actors being immoral and accidentally destroying bitcoin but by the most powerful ones with the intention of doing it.

This also expands upon the idea presented by others to have block chains dedicated to property ownership/title. So you could have a block chains dedicated to iphone5s or vehicles, and if some one puts it up to auction they could digitally sign the auction so you can verify they are the owner of that vehicle.

I think it's a mistake to suggest there is an 'actual price'. The price everyone uses simply reflects the current supply and demand through MtGox. It's worth noting that the price in other exchanges have usually been lower than MtGox, except when MtGox has had technical (or legal) difficulties.
The demand we saw a few months earlier was unsustainable, and what we are seeing is what is more sustainable demand.
Supply itself is not really fixed, as mining difficulty is constantly having to catch up to increase in total hashing power, so for certain periods supply is outpacing demand. In the last month and a half, difficulty has had to double to catch up to the hashing power produced by all the new ASICMiner hardware. These gains are typically temporary (as difficulty catches up) and it looks like the last difficulty jump was reduced, so it will be interesting to see if BTC prices rise in the coming month as supply stabilizes again.

It looks like they are using coinbase. When I plugged in the bitcoin address to send my payment, coinbase replaced the address with the name and email of Mises Institute, which makes me believe the address was a coinbase address.
They are not what I would consider a fully integrated coinbase merchant. They didn't tell me how many bitcoins to send or the exchange rate, only the price in USD, or maybe I missed it on the order fill out page. You also have to copy the bitcoin payment address from the order fill out page because the order page doesn't give you that address.

You're looking at the ends and not the means. Breaking windows is a means to creating jobs, although by breaking someone's window you have stolen their wealth, just as creating new money is theft. The point is that it's not creating wealth, its just deferring it from one sector in the economy to another (from the public sector to the government sector). Breaking a window doesn't create anything new, it just replaces what was broken and in the process people end up spending money on fixing windows that the money would have been used for other purposes. Now in the short run it can create jobs to replace the broken windows but in the long run you will have a lot of unemployed window repairers, as the market would have malinvested in window repair businesses and in the skilled labor to do it, instead of pursuing a more diverse set of ends.

While I think giving/trading money is an expression of free speech. A private key is more like a special pen that you can use to sign a document than it is free speech. It's your ability to speak, it's your mouth, but it is not the speech itself.
If I disagree with some, I can express that as words from my mouth or as written on a piece of paper, I can also express it by funding those who also disagree with them such as journalists or politicians or political movements. When people see how much money support there is, it is a "thank you" and an "I agree with you" or even "I like your product".
You can even look at the bitcoin blockchain as a document. I write down that I want to transfer units of value from one address to another and I sign it with my private key. Thus the bitcoin block chain is public document, it is free speech.

Where is the weakness in this? Centralized planning usually fails big time, especially when you have market manipulation, which causes shortages or surpluses.
Venezuela for example, is the poster child for failures in centralized planning, with its toilet paper shortage which they blame on capitalist profiteering hoarders and nothing to do with price fixing, and the looting of their bestbuy equivalent stores after arresting the owners accusing them of profiteering.
And yes bitcoin is risky, not being easy to "research", but maybe for once people will be cautious, unlike the real estate bubble where lots of research was done and plenty of warning signs existed prior to that bubble bursting and yet it still happened.

Mining doesn't have to do with demand, it has to do with supply. When there is more supply than demand there is more pressure to put prices closer to the bottom as suppliers compete to sell their BTC to the fewer who want to buy some.
The bottom is the cost of electricity and recovery of other costs (like ROI on hardware) and/or profits, this is the minimal that miners are willing to sell their mined BTC for or to even continue to mine BTC.

I don't mean it doesn't make your life in general easier, you still need to work for the money you use to buy stuff with. But in terms of the transaction you need to dig out the proper cash, and you need to make sure they are giving you the proper change, then you need to have a wallet filled with bills instead of a single credit card, and then all the change.

That's a very good point, I was assuming they needed to exit bitcoin.
I guess this is not necessarily a bad thing though, they are kind of just compressing it to what in theory is the bottom, or taking the cream off the top, and at least in theory they will not want to sell bellow some undetermined amount because it could bounce back, since for many, it will be considered a good time to buy and the dumpers could end up taking a loss.

The actual difficulty in determining a single value stems from the fact that each every bitcoin out there has its own value. If a bitcoin was purchased for $260 that bitcoin is still worth that much (at least to the owner) unless the owner decides to sell it for less, then the bitcoin takes the new value. Miners value their bitcoins at the price of the electricity and ROI of hardware.
The difficulty is in measuring the volume of bitcoins out there at different prices. Exchanges are a way to peak at these values, but they may only attract certain population of Bitcoiners and so may end up driving the price down since they don't represent the entire population bitcoins, that is where 'speculation' is at.
The only real way bitcoins go up in value is when it is actually accepted in more places. Miners for example are more willing to part with their bitcoins at a lower price than everyone else, and many of them probably need to convert their bitcoins to another currency to pay rent, utilities, food, car payments, etc. Payment services don't help, since they are simply converting to a currency to pay for things on your behalf.

You can own sand, and you can make sand castles with it, doesn't make it of value to any one else. The value of a thing is still in the mind of those you would trade with. Just as a bank may assign units of value to you or the bitcoin network assigns units of value to you, but you'd don't own the value that is in the minds of others, they can change those values. A central bank can create more notes and reduce the value of the physical notes in your pocket.

Another way to look at this problem. You never **consciously** control your heart, you rarely control your breath, arms and legs. Those are autonomous to your conscious mind most or all of the time. Most of the time your conscious mind navigates or plans and then sits quite or goes through thoughts, imagination and priorities while the subconscious parts of the brain control locomotion to get you to the planned destination. So in essence they will give you time to learn and think and share your thoughts which can be valuable as it provides information that can be used to predict market behaviour. These autonomous agents can also be thought of as farmers trying to grow organic brains, you may be paid to see what kind of thoughts are generated by learning certain things in different ways, which benefit them with conscious thought and different perspectives of the same information.

There needs to be crypto currency versions of fiat currencies in order to do P2P exchanges properly. If you look at how easy it is to exchange other crypto currencies, there are lots of them on bitmit.net and that is not even designed to be an exchange.
There are 2 ways that could happen, either some bank sets up an equivalent to bitcoin that is backed by USD in a vault (this would require high transaction fees to compensate for mining not producing new coins). Or some one (outside of the US) documents the destruction of USD bills, possibly with a machine that scans each bill and checks for counterfeits and destroys it, and for each dollar destroyed issues a new digital coin that can be spent, this is basically what the DMV does with MSOs so that only they can own your vehicle and issue you a title of ownership instead.

And I don't just mean looking at your bank statement but actually pulling out collected receipts and making sure they match up.

My logic is that the majority are not accepting USD and then converting to gold, they are putting USD in a bank and then later paying USD for rent, electricity and employees, those employees store their money in a bank and/or pay off debts which are also in USD (not gold). USD would be a good store of value, provided counterfeiting could be prevented but legalized counterfeiting (aka inflation) makes it not such a good store of value, but a bank savings account can be, provided interest rates are higher than counterfeiting, although in recent times counterfeiting has been higher than interest rates making gold and real estate better stores of value.

That is still kind of high considering that some one just bought a jalapeño for 20.5BTC
There is also an active one on eBay that is right now about 23.5BTC (89USD/BTC MtGOX) it will be interesting to see if it goes that high or not.

Here in the US, I bought a 240hz 3d HDTV from costco last week for christmas and I saw several 3d HDTVs in Costco, they were not old models at all. They were different brands as well, Samsung, Vizio, Panasonic and Sharp. The reason I bought it was that I enjoyed the Hobbit movies which had HFR 3D and wanted the same experience, and I've been watching a ton of old 3d movies that I would watch on my PC with shutter glasses.
But I think the new technology that is going to blow away high frame rate, 3d, and even 4k, is going to be what Dolby Digital is working on, which is an ultra bright displays that show a larger range of lighting similar to high dynamic range photography. I was lucky enough to see this tech in person and it was amazing, everyone else is going to be able to see it in person at this coming CES.

A patent can't cover 'prior art', they could hinder innovation in payment systems by patenting particular mechanisms.

I like to think of the Federal Reserve as a Septillionaire (or Infinitaire if there is such a word), who once in a while likes to buy government bonds or bank debts. The problem is that such a person would normally be skeptical about taking bad debts, but in this case is trying to be charitable, the problem is that they (the banks) are not learning from their mistakes and in fact if they are learning anything it's that they can do what they want and not have to pay for it.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding this. If the 'selfish' miners lose at any point, doesn't that nullify all of their past work? Will they move to to the honest fork or stay in the selfish fork? Also if at any point they win (their fork accidentally dominating the honest fork) doesn't that destroy the 'honest' blockchain and they all end up moving to the selfish version of the blockchain, or is the strategy to always have two competing blockchains, one dominated by selfish miners and one to distract a portion of the 'honest' miners, which I have to wonder how feasible that is?

1) This really depends. Paying with cash is more complicated than paying with a credit card in person for example. In the online world credit cards are complicated with out an intermediate service, requiring you to share a lot of personal information, even for digital goods. With an intermediary service like Paypal credit cards are easier, and Coinbase does this for bitcoin as well. But without an intermediary bitcoins can be easier than credit cards if you are using the bitcoin app, in many cases I have purchased stuff while only giving my email address, and in others I am not giving them credit card information, just shipping information, with out the need to create an account.
2) It can definitely improve in this regard, in my experience though coinbase usually does a good job until you get huge demand, like the before the bubble in April.
3) I've bought a lot with it, I used to get stuff on bitmit.net but now use services like btczone.com or gyft.com, when you use these intermediate services you can buy just about anything on amazon.
4) The use of bitcoin as a digital currency for trading goods online is very important to its value, anyone who is investing in it should know this and be promoting that. I personally buy stuff all the time, as a way to test it and promote people offering goods and to get back some of the value of my early investment. **But I don't know where you get that 'most people' with out a survey or statistics**. My experience is contrary, I have a lot more pressure from friends and family to convert my bitcoins back to USD (trade my bitcoins for USD) when they hear about how much its gone up in value, but that would expose me to higher taxes, I'd much rather trade my bitcoins for other stuff. Currently I am waiting for shopify to start listing places that accept bitcoin so I can try them out! I'm hoping bitmit.net will come back!

It's backed by public and private debt.
The best example I've heard is that they are like bus tokens. If you buy bus tokens, they are obligations (debt) by the bus company to provide service. People can buy as many tokens as they want, they are giving money to the bus company up front which can be used for various things to improve and maintain their service. But if you also imagine that people started trading these bus tokens amongst themselves as a currency, they are still used to pay for service to the bus company, just as the US government is paid in USD. The main difference though is that a bus company can't force you to give it tokens even when you don't ride the bus. The other difference is that in the case of USD you 'buy' the 'bus tokens' with debt.
As Bob Murphy asks in this video, why are we playing their game?

Don't buy an AMD card, you are looking at 200 watts or more for that 240Mhashes.
Keep your Nvidia card and get an ASICMiner USB Block Erupter for 1.05BTC (or $74 at current exchange rates), it only takes 2.5 watts and outputs 329Mhashes.
Don't use your Nvidia card for mining at all, you are likely losing money to electricity versus the bitcoins you would make. Then again maybe litecoins are still worth while.

I can pretty much figure he isn't a good guy based upon his position with out needing to know things about his personal life that the OP posted.
And his personal life is definitely screwed up but everything the OP posted sounds like rantings from his Ex's who have a bone to pick. I mean if he was doing all those drugs and other crap that is said, what does that tell you about the women he has hanging around with?
Also none of that tells you about who he is now, maybe he turned a new leaf and is against drug distribution because he wanted something to blame why he is such a screw up, or maybe not.
And while you can maybe look at his past to explain why **he** has his position on Bitcoin, how does that make that particular position wrong? It doesn't and so its a waste of time, that should be spent taking apart the position. He will be busy promoting that position.

Basically we can never pay down the debt, with a currency that is backed by that debt. Which means paying down the debt destroys the currency. So a separate currency is needed to pay it down, but even then it's not really possible.

It's not mistaken, and it's a matter of fact, that they mine less BTC because of the hardware they have sold is competing with their own mining operation, BUT that doesn't mean they are not profiting from selling hardware.

I really don't read his articles as much, so I' curious, how often does he take back things he's mistaken about? I think if you have a lot of people that read what you write, you have some responsibility to make sure your readers know that something you said turned out to be mistaken.

I was thinking it could be decentralized, if the transaction fees were high enough and it could also be that transactions fees are lowered if you are running a miner at a particular hash rate. The crypto currency issuing 'bank' itself could also have its own ASIC mining farm to help secure its own currency and at the same time get most of the transaction fees.

The beginning of Bitcoins doesnt matter, at that point it was never traded for real goods or other currencies, it was just an experiment. At what point though does it make sense to apply laws. Video game developers create virtual currencies and virtual goods all the time, and players can trade for real life things external to the video game even if the game developer says its against the terms of service. At what point do these same regulations need to be applied to Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Sony, CCP, etc?
Would they also be willing to handicap US citizens who would mine bitcoin versus other countries who would not handicap their people? At some point they are causing the US to lose in the race for bitcoins.

What I mean is for example, some dollars were lost, destroyed (intentionally accidentally) and then if it becomes rare, people will hold on to them as collectible items, by then also deflation would have made the remaining dollars more valuable. And even with other currencies taking its place the central bank would need to accept that currency as payment for debts. Of course the central bank could be destroyed or the remaining debt defaulted on would be other ways for the debt to disappear but that's hardly the equivalent to paying down the debt.

I guess it depends if we are talking about how much debt you have on your credit card or how much money you have in your debit. If your worried about how much money you can spend on a card, I don't see how cash will make that less a problem. And unless your giving the whole $20 you will get back change, $10 $5 $1 $0.25 $0.10 $0.05 $0.01 and you the have to hand those over when you buy something else, and then if you just put the coins in a jar instead of giving exact change you then have to take those to the bank or some machine. I have an auto pay for my credit card so I don't have to worry about it.
There are a lot more posts and articles about bitcoin as a technology being adapted or accepted into payment systems. That's not really good news for 'investors' because that means more spending, which will stabilize the price as it grows, that says something contrary to the argument but I'm also not willing to say that some how represents all bitcoin owners.

It seems a lot more high level, like it may be more useful for negotiating and accepting transactions, but my idea is more to have bitcoin clients/nodes that can work with other block chains, like having a client that supports both litecoins and bitcoins. It may even need another mechanism where both parties need to sign a transaction before its accepted on both block chain networks, and double spending attempts may invalidate a transaction on one network and the other network would then have to rewrite part of it to remove the invalid transaction.

I came to the same conclusion reading the patent.
It could apply to technology where a 'request' is generated as a qr code, that request results in bitcoins being transferred to your 'mobile device' or online wallet (account). For example an offline wallet can pass you a qr code of a transaction, that transaction results in your bitcoin wallet getting bitcoins. Their application for example is that you watch advertisement and they give you bitcoins in return.
Things like bctip.org and OpenTransact could be affected by this patent.

No, if that were true I'd have less complaints about Android. Anyone who thinks Android feels more like a PC has never tried to use Android in place of a real PC. Either that or they have never done anything productive on a PC.
