I tend to agree...
My only thoughts so far:
* 26 words could mean 26 letters of the alphabet. But then the questions are: Are they in order of appearance (step = a,  etc)? And also... How the heck do these relate to the number sequence?
* 8 of the 26 words are part of the BIP39 table. Giving us technically 10/12 words from the puzzle if we are lucky... But even if we were lucky and those are the actual words in their correct order, we still miss words 10 and 11 and have actually no real idea (any more than before) how to extract these from the numbers...
I will try going back to basics... Looking at the discussion thread up to the point when  [u/frankybet]( mentioned twice that some people are very close...and check what had been suggested up to this point (considering the added knowledge of 4 hints of course).
Again - I still believe the puzzle was supposed to be "self sufficient" and perfectly solvable with none of the hints...

Wow! Oscars were actually mentioned in a previous post long ago... and the puzzle poster confirmed that some people were "very close".
So I guess we can assume that the dates are related to Oscar winning movies then... Perhaps US release dates... IMDB...

It's in the text itself now...not comments

What's the thought process behind this? Because with no further explanation it really is only a table dump...
My thoughts are:
1) to be fair - the puzzle should be self contained with no external sources to use
2) considering that, the Rain Man hint should only be a "direction" hint I believe... (week days are important or the numbers 1 - 14 might be cards for blackjack... But weekdays makes more sense, when we would not know about "Rain Man")
3) The puzzle creators confirmed about a month ago, that some people were pretty close...up until that point there was no rain man hint yet...
4) We know that word6 is "ESCAPE" and word12 is "WRAP" -- both words are part of the BIP39 Mnemonic database ([ So I think we could safely assume that all other words are coming out of this database as well, which actually gives us placement numbers as references ( Escape = 617, Wrap = 2033 in the table)
5) IMHO we need to come up with a calculation method, that involves calendar days and can consistently come up with "617" for group 6 and "2033" for group 12... 
6) Groups 13 and 14 might only be red herrings... or if they would actually refer to a blackjack card value, they might be part of a different group (13 = King = value 10, 14 = Ace = value 11...)... 
Having said all of that, I haven't comeup with a consistent method yet... But perhaps it helps summarizing the progress so far a bit...
Any thoughts???

Do you bother to share your progress on that hint maybe? And we could brainstorm for linkage to the rest of the puzzle...?

The last hint should probably make things more clear... I have to admit, I am more confused now... after messing with these numbers for a week...
26 words = 26 letters of the alphabet?...
Anyone gets it (I guess we'll see latest when the wallet is empty)...?
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:44:59
I also thought that once the "utlimate" hint is published, it will be a matter of minutes, max. hours until someone opens the wallet... Well - let's see...

Someone posted that they extracted the alphabet from the hint and have no clue how to link it to the rest of the puzzle.
Unfortunately that post was deleted after less than 1 minute

 Cipher Hint
If you decrypt the text here, you'll be one step closer to solving the Cipher Game : 
***step  order  enmity  raven***    
***gazette  angry  habit***    
***city  runner  rehabilitation***   
***alphabet  tequila  orrery***    
***nullity  injection  coffee***    
***thanks  aluminium  saw***   
***oax  ray session***    
***each  waist  naked  stop***

That is how far I got as well... Then cycling through different cipher types to no avail...I feel so stupid now... not even able to find the encryption method, now that I know all 12 words... :(

Someone also solved the [Beta puzzle]( for 0.02 BTC -- congrats.. I was still hoping for that one ;)
Apparently someone different though...at least transferred to different wallet...
Now that there is no more money at stake -- perhaps any of the winners cares to share the exact solution with the community?
I guess many got as far as finding the Oscar winners, by year of ceremony and date of winners birthday... counting the letters by the prefix number still gave an encrypted string... What was next? Just want to learn :)

Has anyone had a look at the original picture (file) posted here: [ ???
Entire files can be hidden inside pictures...
It seems rather big with almost 1/2 MB for a png with more or less 2 colours...
Also the naming might bear some hint perhaps??... just guessing here... But maybe an idea for a fresh direction to look into?

Bitcoin SV is the real Bcash...

Looking forward to that already :)

How does this fit into the picture?
This very painting was put on a fundraiser site about the time when the puzzle was published... goal 500$ "No amount is too small." 
How do you post that while putting up 28 BTC as a prize?
Makes no sense for me... I think it is just publicity...the painting gets exposure while apparently being a still unsolved puzzle for a hight BTC prize...
