This is stupid because there are a litany of natural issues that could lead to the downfall of power grids/the internet.
No ability to access the net or if you local doesn't regularly use bitcoin, then you are screwed.
However, with gold, you can parlay.

Yes. What news station do you see Pushing Bernie’s agenda?

Weird flex but ok.

Do you realize you are accosting me for willingly choosing not to give him my ears.
Fascist much?
Also, you quite literally copy-pasted his biography.
This isn’t really a concurrent list of his positions on different topics, but I digress.

No offense.
But dude came out in Support of some prettt right leaning stances.
Take a stroll over to his Sub and the people who follow/used to follow him have a pretty decent breakdown of his position shifting from Center to right.
@_date: 2019-01-16 13:54:07
His positions have drifted from center to conservative since 2016.

How about no.
Why am I donating to a guy who is receiving funds from a Super PAC?
I though we only donate to people who ACTUALLY need the money.

Because it usually turns out to be true.

Bingo. This is why I stopped listening to him.
He went from a Centrist to full on Conservative that spouts the same conservative talking points as the rest of them.
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:05:51
That the thing.
His POSITIONS HAVE SHIFTED FROM CLASSICAL LIBERAL TO CONSERVATIVE SINCE 2016.
That’s the point I’m making.
He’s moved from Center-Left to Right/Center-Right.
I have Ben Shapiro for that angle.

Actually this is false.
Democracy is antithetical to individualism.
