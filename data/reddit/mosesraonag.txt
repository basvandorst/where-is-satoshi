Just because someone writes „swiss“ or „switzerland“ in his ICO infos, doesen‘t mean switzerland is doing anything. They are using the Swiss Frank and the swiss economy to make people believe it‘s leggit.
If youre stupid enoughe to fall for a scam like that, you deserve it.

Please, don't just install random wallets without knowing them or what they exactly do. Best way to loose your money.

I live in switzerland since i'm born. Have you actually ever lived in switzerland or informed yourself with real news or just talking shit?   
If you're really a crypto / blockchain fan you'd be happy about things like that.

Why did you delete your comments insulting me?  
Im going to post my awnser to you callimg me a "fcknig prick and dumb fck" 
I didn't say you posted your supreme bot stuff in this subreddit.  
You try to scam people with a free Supreme Bot in an other subreddit and the first thing you post on the is "give me free money"  
You didn't even beg and say you're poor or anything. Just straight up "send money here".  
So what I'm saying is don't try your stupid games on this subreddit it wont work.  
But yeah... maybe prick you can call me, but dumb f\*ck after this post... i don't know my friend.

Because Buffet only invests his money in things that do something.  
Like a company that has a working product and people that are depended on that companie.
He never invests in something that only goes up in value because people want to pay more for it.  
It's not that he thinks gold is a bad investment overall, it's just not the way he specifically invests.

He's against something we're for, I get that, but saying stupid sh!t like that doesne't help.  
You're talking about a guy with a networth of 86billion.  
An Investment legend and you're calling him a glorified gamlber. A lot of things he says and explains in MANY interviews he has given, can be used in a different way in crypto investing.   
Don't denounce someone with useful information, just because you don't like one of his personal opinions.

You must have a lot going on in your life.

Never saw making a huge amount of money automatically making you a „glorified gambler“
You‘re in the wrong.
If he would be a gambler every single investor would be a stupid gambler and investing would be gambling.
Youre not just talking about any investor here, youre talking about one of the BEST EVER.
But it‘s ok, define him with 2 words.
„The most significant charitable donation Warren Buffett has ever made is his $37 billion pledge to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This donation, originally pledged in 2006, will take effect upon his death, as he has directed in his will“
What are you doing for humanity?

How to say nothing in a sentence.

If you're gonna try to spam some scamy sh!t like your "I FOUND A FREE SUPREME BOT", this will be a bad subreddit for you.   
Just a heads up
