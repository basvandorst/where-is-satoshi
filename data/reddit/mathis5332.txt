Rounding error.

You didn't get his point. The loans can never be fully paid off. If the fed lends $1000 at interest rate 1%, the borrower has to pay back $1010. So he has to pay back $10 that don't exist. So someone else has to take out a loan... it's a snowball system.

ELI5: why does there have to be a limit anyway? What is the problem with unlimited block size?
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:06:13
You are talking about a bank. I was talking about the FED. Banks do not (initially) create money. The FED does. You example doesn't work with a FED banker, unless, you know, he prints money for himself.

OK makes sense. But still, a hard limit doesn't make sense. A sliding limit that gets adjusted like difficulty every X blocks makes more sense (if A% in the last X blocks were more than B% "full", the limit gets raised by Y%; plus another condition for the reduction of the blocksize)

Most people trust people more than they trust themselves (or reality for that matter). You cannot convince somebody who doesn't trust himself to judge accurately the facts of reality. Regulation, to them, is a web of "someone will safe me", not a fixed and predictable set of rules.

Interest paid to the FED is not going back into circulation, but disappears.

Principle is an irrational trading strategy. It's not an irrational investment strategy. Investing in index funds would be a rational investment strategy.

"No ID required" with LBC might be wrong, depending on where you use it. Legally, sellers are required (in some countries) to check IDs for trades above a certain amount and/or frequency (see Switzerland which has a very detailed guideline). Of course, it depends on your definition of "required" - technically, it's easier to skip verification with LBC.

Important point: none of them should be considered interested in *sustainably* growing bitcoin. It's too much work to sustainably increase the price; they'll rather artificially inflate the price temporarily (as bubbles can rarely be sustained over the long term).

Q: Most credit cards have a "base currency". If you pay for something in any other currency, there will be a exchange fee (something like 1%). Will your service be similar in this respect, or will it be free for all types of currencies (or even just a set of currencies such as EUR, USD etc.)?

False. There are still countries in the EU with bank secrecy laws (e.g. Austria). Anyone who thinks those laws really protect them against their local government is just kidding themselves. However, it's pretty unimaginable that the Austrian government violates the laws (or gets rid of them) simply for a joke like the Greek government.

Well, that's the crux of the matter, isn't it? No one dares to step up and build a business, because the money will be taken either way. Unless the government is somehow not able to steal the money, that is. Gotta love statists.

I know how the EU works. Just because there are *some* laws EU countries have to implement, does not mean that claims are correct. If you search for "youth" in the article, you find exactly one reference that is not very specific.

The joke's on you. *You* might pay less when you go to that country, but the people who live there pay more.

First, you probably don't even know whether their prices increased or not. Second, when they increased, how would you know that it was *not* because of this? In fact, in Austria, part of recent price increases (as in 'over the last few years') were definitely because of this regulation, since roaming is a significant revenue stream of Austrian carriers (roaming as in foreign people using their cellphones in Austria).

It makes sense that it is possible (otherwise you could use your kids as a financial safe haven). But it shouldn't happen unless it's actually the parents' money (don't know about the legal situation though)

I have asked nicely for a source for those claims that I deem wrong to my best knowledge, because I am willing to learn and revise my initial position. All I got in return was a random Wikipedia article that does not even begin to touch what the original statement claimed (i.e. that youth protection laws are defined be the EU). Of course I have no intention to pay a lawyer for such insignificant matters.

Hard to generalize, Europe was not a country last time I checked.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:51:55
That's a Wikipedia article, not a link to any specific law.
