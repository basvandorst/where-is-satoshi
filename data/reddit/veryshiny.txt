Could have easily hired a French speaking employee and Ctrl+f'd their support tickets for "french"

They control the largest blockchain and will orphan any blocks that includes transactions not conforming to their rules.

Miners will not adopt smart fees unless the fees go up. Two of the large mining fees straight said so.

MtGox support employee has confirmed that they can't comment "because US government"

Yep, I had $0 and nearly 1 BTC, now I have $211.

No timed reissues if TX is still in their pool. This issue could have caused the mutated TX to overwrite the original TX, causing an reissue.
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:09:21
They probably did test, like code in api2.PHP and make sure its working-ish before releasing.
Oh and their cache has been reporting 500s as gateway timeouts.

Doesn't matter the cause. You must apply the same procedures all the time. It cannot be subjective.
Now if it was in their privacy policy, then they should do it. If not, never.

Technically they can say, we lost private keys to this and this address. Here is a Bitcoin fork that allows another set of new public keys to spend those coins. Everyone, go upgrade and get others to upgrade if you want your money back.
If the amount is 750K btc, then they have a chance at getting the fork accepted because if you lost coins there, you'll advocate for it.
@_date: 2014-02-27 12:22:01
While that is your interpolation of what Bitcoin was designed for, my readings of Satoshi's posts tell a different story. Based on his introductory posts on cryptography mailing lists, the forum, and the Bitcoin white paper, it is quite clear to me he is **against** middlemans and that Bitcoin was designed for everyone to control their own private keys.
Promoting that people should always handle their money themselves is a good idea in my opinion, especially with Bitcoin as there is no government insurance and there most likely will never be.
@_date: 2014-03-01 08:10:21
You are just speaking for yourself. Everyone I know, including me who has lost money in Gox wants this to happen.

Hello, MtGox inquiry center. How may I help you?
**How did a hacker steal that many coins?**
We cannot discuss that at the moment.
**When will I get my money back?**
We are working on getting your money back as soon as possible.
**Can you give me a timeframe for that?**
We are working as soon as possible.
**How are you going to work your way out of this with the massive loss?**
We are adding litecoin trading very soon. Please protect your account using OTP to ensure that your funds are safe and secure. Thank you for calling.

There is no difference with a offline wallet with client sided encryption.
I'm talking about pure client sided wallets.

Bitcoin is absolutely doomed with near zero chance of recourse if a hostile government has 6.5% of the monetary base and acts hostile. 
In desperate moments, certain options look attractive.
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:55:33
They do not need 51% of the network. 10% of the network is enough to double spend 0 confirms with ~25% success rate (and undetectable if they fail), 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:21:29
If we find out it is a government. the community will most likely agree to fork where the government's bitcoins are blocked from being able to be spent.
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:37:39
Because Bitcoin is open source. If you know coding, read every line of the code yourself. But you don't need to, because the core development team composes of members from several different backgrounds and countries, and thousands look at the bitcoin code.
Bitcoin is just a protocol actually, like HTTP, IRC, SMTP. Bitcoin-Qt is like Firefox, Thunderbird. Even if Bitcoin-Qt was broken somehow, Bitcoin can never die because it's just a protocol and alternative clients will pop up.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:21:45
No. Coinbase pays "social media" teams to shill across reddit, FB, Twitter, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:21:21
The coinbase shilling needs to stop.
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:53:34
No, it wouldn't. Hosted Bitcoin wallets is against what Bitcoin stands for. Read the white paper - the goal, right from Satoshi's mouth is to give people cryptographic control of money.
Any time you use a hosted wallet, you're not using Bitcoin as the designer designed it to be.

What this indictment has proved is that the even the DEA accesses emails of everyone, everywhere. They would have had NO possible reason to suspect BitInstant, and checking the emails of all bitcoin exchanges "just in case" is against reasonable prove.

Worse than NSA. Snowden has said the GCHQ is even worse.

But the web platform is down. Either the hackers managed to find an exploit in their Linux distro / stack, or these hackers hacked MtGox before the platform went down.

IIRC back in 2011 with the first gox hack, their password was just two words and a number.

So what? **PHP sucks, but it doesn't matter.** Facebook was built with PHP - now, still PHP, just compiled.

It's your penalty for using Coinbase. Don't use exchange wallets for anything beyond a place to hold your coins as you trade. Do you want MtGox to happen to you? No bitcoin exchange is FDIC insured, and no non-FDIC insured place is safe to put money in long term.
@_date: 2014-01-28 13:46:29
Coinbase is for centralization of Bitcoin. Not something you want to protect Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:40:53
Please do not use Coinbase as a wallet. Satoshi designed Bitcoin so you can have cryptographic control of your money. This is something that can be exclusively delivered by locally executed clients (eg Multibit, Blockchain.info)
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:22:41
Yes. Bitcoin is considered a currency under federal law, but not legal tender.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:45:21
Not true at all. No encryption is involved in Bitcoin addresses (public private key pairs).  It is VERY close to what normal miners do. It's just a billion times harder time wise.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:13:51
**Do not use web wallets for long term storage**.
@_date: 2014-01-06 10:52:22
Yes. The default Bitcoin client marks it as non standard and does not include them into blocks. Some pools allow it.

The blockchain has no time. That's simply because you have a network of tends of thousands of computers, not all of them having the same time - maybe a few secs apart, maybe a minute. If you look, all measures of "time" are blocks.

It's harsh but it's the truth. When is the last time you've seen a $0.50 bonus? Take a look around, real serious businesses offer **at least** $5.

Don't use on online wallets.

Duh. Bitcoin is about decentralization, not handing your wallet and Bitcoins to a random closed source app.

The fee went to BTCGuild miners. Yes, it is a transaction fee.

@_date: 2013-09-10 23:01:11
I agree with you!
@_date: 2013-09-08 00:38:07
Yep, for example a lot of faucets use Inputs.io to send tiny amounts of BTC without fees. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:25:53
Yes, this is correct. However the brick and mortar locations would be considered a money service business if they do buy AND sell.
Because when there is 1 buyer, 1 seller, and there is a location, the location because the third party.
