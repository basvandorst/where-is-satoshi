I think this means that mining power should be at the hands of users, not big mining farms. Bring back GPU mining.

Whatever you want, England.

Just make one that uses all the parts of a GPU
end result: more/better gpus.

Only way to challenge them is to start a multi million asic farm.

What about VTC, i hear its specially made to use all parts of the GPU, so if they were to make an ASIC for that, it would just be a new GPU, would be nice, GPUs by more than 2 companies.

Wasn't this decided like half a year ago to start calling it digital currency?

I think the problem we are facing is that most of the mining power is in the hands of a select few with huge mining farms, instead of the power being spread out between casual people.

Is there a reason why we can't make it run off the 2030 GPUs?
Gotta adapt if you want to survive, thats the basis of human civilization.

I meant that as all things, the code has to be changed. Make it run off of things that average people have.

I think we should take the power back from ASIC farms, bring back cpu/gpu mining.

I don't think renting their equipment is illegal in any way.

I can predict just fine, if the bitcoin is on the verge of losing all credibility from a 51% attack, people will sell their coins.

What about some sort of tax? If you have over 30-40%, you get something.
That, or just a tax by Ghash to its users, 10% and 50%, and 0% at 30%.

I think a good fix would be to go back to GPU mining, keep the hashing power in the hands of people, not huge mining farms.
