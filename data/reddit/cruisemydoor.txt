Yeah this doesn't mean that the account holders will get anything. This isn't a bank, it is just a company. They will have to get in line behind all the other creditors. That is how bankruptcy works. Hopefully they have some sort of claim that that they perfected their security interest in those particular funds before GOX went bankrupt but the more likely scenario is that no one had a perfected security interest in anything and that they will all just be creditors.

Nope. To the end user bitcoin is less secure. The transactions are irreversible, the exchanges and online wallets aren't insured, and the physical security options are complicated.

That is an oversimplification. The problem is not government. The problem is how our current government functions. We can debate about how the government should spend money but I think we all agree that we need government. What you are suggesting is stupid and short sighted. If you really care about social programs you would realize that the majority of your tax dollars goes to social programs. Medicare and social security (social welfare programs) make up 50% of our current budget. Where would we be without those programs or the physical and social infastructure (roads, schools, power lines, etc.) that the government provides? You think because you don't agree with every dollar the government spends you shouldn't have to pay taxes? That is a selfish and stupid attitude. If you care about how the government spends money then get involved and try and change the current political regime. Otherwise you are just an ass that complains about the current state of things but does nothing to pitch in. If that is who you are I hope the IRS finds you and prosecutes you for every penny of taxes you avoided because people like you are the real problem in this country.

Honestly you sound like you have a terrible credit card. My Chase Rewards card has none of those fees plus I get 1% cash back on all my purchases.
Also I am not talking about the fees that get charged to merchants, only consumers. Consumers have no incentive to change the current fee structure to make it cheaper for merchants. There is no evidence that any of those savings will be passed on to consumers. In fact there is evidence that the opposite will happen. Debit card fees have gone down substantially in America since the Fed started regulating the rate credit card processors could charge merchants. But there has been no appreciable drop in consumer goods prices since that change.

He is only mentioned as a "local business owner" but basically the police flipped the guy I did the SARs on and got him to inform on the rest of the people involved.

How does that disprove what I said? Later in the presentation they say that they don't need to get 100% success because they can make identifications without that. They even admit that they don't want to "scare" people away from TOR because it has a critical mass of people performing illegal activities. That was 2 years ago. Today they announced that they busted a child porn ring that was using TOR. Do you really think they have made no progress on identifying people on TOR?

Do you still think bit coin transactions will be cheaper than the current system (traditional banks, debit cards, credit cards, etc.)?

Is this really fixing a problem for merchants if they are already paying very low fees? Source:

I think you and I are talking past each other. There is a famous quote about the internet that I think applies to TOR here: "The Internet is like a vault with a screen door on the back. I don't need jackhammers and atom bomb to get in when I can walk through the door." In this case the NSA isn't attacking the cryptography (bank vault door) they are attacking the end user (screen door). They only need to identify a few people to make the entire network unsecure. To the extent that people use TOR to transact or interact with each other they can never be sure that they aren't dealing with someone that is 1)infected by an NSA program, 2) an NSA agent, 3) under the influence of the NSA or another law enforcement agency. TOR is vulnerable because the people that use it are fallible. You can go on pretending that cryptography makes TOR secure but you are only lying to yourself.

How is bitcoin better than a credit card for consumers? Consumers don't pay any fees for using credit cards and they have 0% liability and fraud protection. Credit cards can also be used world wide and usually allow access to revolving credit  with no immediate interest (i.e. I can spend money now and pay my card off when I get paid without paying interest). What does bitcoin offer that is better than this?

I have worked in a bank. I had to fill out CTRs (currency transaction reports) and SAR (suspicious activity reports) for AML compliance. It really does work. Specifically SARs can be very effective. I once had a customer that brought in a $9,500 of cash a day from his barber shop. He was obviously avoiding the $10,000 CTR threshold so I started reporting him with SARs. Well I got a call from our security team that they were working with local police and the FBI to investigate him. I had to give a statement about his transactions and mannerism when making them. A month later they arrested him as part of a prostitution and human smuggling ring. Turns out the money was one of several businesses that were used to launder money for a prostitution ring that brought girls in from different countries. Anyway that is anecdotal but it proves that at least sometimes AMLs can help prevent serious crimes.

Again, this is not an IP problem, this is a problem with our healthcare system. Consider what you are saying. If Pharma companies couldn't be guaranteed some profits they would never invest the millions of dollars on R&amp;D and the years of time it takes to develop these drugs.

Nothing about the network is untraceable. It is the exact opposite of that. It is extremely traceable. Users have to use computers to access and trade bitcoins (because of the nature of verification, block chain, etc.). That leaves a trail every time someone buys or sells bit coin. The government loves the idea of this stuff being traceable. You know what is hard to trace? Physical cash transactions! If you think that TOR and other networks hide your identity you are kidding yourself. If we learned anything from the Snowden leaks it is that governments have built back doors into every piece of hardware and software that that has been produced since 9/11. Now whether or not they use that intelligence against you is a different story. If you aren't doing anything illegal you are probably fine.

You can believe whatever you want about the government's access to TOR or any other supposedly secure application. You should read the Guardian and Washington Post stories about those leaks. They pretty much refute much of what you said. Here is one that addresses your belief about TOR:

I think it damages the entire bitcoin community when unscrupulous individuals try to use bitcoin to get around gambling and securities laws. This is just like the silk road debacle. Business owners wont want to adopt bitcoin if it is associated with these kinds of activities.

Yes but most bit coin merchant processing companies, like coinbase, charge at least 1%. The fees aren't really about the cost of the transaction in either case (BTC or Fiat). The fees are associated with paying for fraud prevention measures and maintaining infrastructure and marketing. How would BTC offer an advantage in that area? Also if you look at the article I posted it shows that debit card transaction fees now average less than .5% of each transaction.

LOL, there are only two things that are certain in life, 1) death &amp; 2) taxes. Good luck trying to avoid either.

But how many of Allstate's (Esurance's parent company) customers actually use bitcoin?

Are you willing to eat a hat if you are wrong?
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:06:20
These are the worst kind of posts. Tell me more about how your unrelated and unverified anecdote will affect the price of a widely traded virtual currency?

This isn't really a battle. Buffet wins before the conversation begins...

By subscribed do you mean bought reddit gold?
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:31:14
I think the price is $485 because that is what people are willing to pay for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:35:14
$1 dollar Bob!

This political crap needs to stop. Bitcoin isn't about hating the government. This is about creating a decentralized alternative currency that empowers individual consumers. To the extent that it disrupts the current economic system, it goes against the government but it really has nothing to do with this cartoon.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:04:05
What does this even mean?
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:42:46
This seems like it will probably send a message to a guy that works for the company that maintains the Apple buses.

Put your coins into cold storage immediately.

LOL. So much market pumping in this sub.

It is a total of $600 throughout the year.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:41:51
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:45:33
We need more information. Which bank? What were the circumstances? What are they telling you now?
@_date: 2014-04-06 08:47:33

They don't.

What exactly are you protesting?
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:55:26
I said the same thing about beanie babies.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:44:29
Yeah this split doesn't really make bitcoin look great.
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:10:17
Which college?
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:45:57
You are an idiot. Have you ever worked in a bank? Have you ever investigated terrorism? You have no background to make any of the statements you made in your post.

China is a big deal.
