FinCEN guidance and rulings on virtual currency don't make sense. They can be interpreted in 5 different ways. Simply being a seller doesn't square with at least two rulings without additional information on what you were doing.
What seems likely is somebody filed a CTR or SAR against you and the IRS came sniffing around because you didn't properly declare the income. They're using the MSB threats to make you afraid of going to jail for a longer period of time.
Regardless, find a lawyer before talking to the IRS more.

What? This is a broad reading of the virtual currency guidance. While *being in the business* of buying and selling through LBC might be money transmission activities under FinCEN, doing it rarely or occasionally is not.

People are too quick to equate "investing in Bitcoin startups" with "Bitcoin is good". The invested-in startups don't necessarily need Bitcoin (some do); it's just a protocol that a good engineering team can replace with something else should Bitcoin not work out.
Investors are investing in these companies because of their disruptive potential, not necessarily because of Bitcoin.
Also, to compare: Stripe Inc. raised $150 million by itself in 2014 (and $70 million before that), a little less than half of the total raised for all Bitcoin startups.

I totally agree. Prosecutors are allowed to tell juries "you are obligated to convict if you find the defendant committed the crime" (which is false), but defendants can't make the opposite argument. It's inherently one-sided in favor of the State (along with many other components of the criminal justice system).
New Hampshire recently passed a law regarding jury nullification which its supreme court stated would likely be *unconstitutional* if it actually allowed for jury nullification arguments. The law as written, however, didn't actually allow for anything.

The Danube -- as rivers tend to do -- has moved since the Austro-Hungarian Empire (I think it was them) established the border over a century ago. Some Serbian river floodplains ended up on the Croatian side but relatively more Croatian river floodplains ended up on the Serbian side (we're seriously not talking about a lot of land here). AFAIK, the guys who made the border were vague on the whole question of what happens when the river moves.
Serbia claims the border continues to be the middle of the Danube because that benefits it while Croatia claims the border is what the Danube was when the border was established because that benefits it. As such, Serbia has asserted sovereignty over the formerly Croatian floodplains while Croatia hasn't asserted sovereignty over the formerly Serbian floodplains.

Inclusion in one block is generally sufficient for "verification" in most cases... which takes, on average, 10 min. Transactions are broadcast instantly which is also enough for some merchants' peace of mind.
While the debit/credit cards claim "instant verification", that's not entirely accurate: the money doesn't actually transfer from the customer's bank to the merchant's bank for several days; there are many weeks where the funds can be reversed even following the transfer following a rather simple process by the customer (which the merchant usually can't do anything to dispute); etc.

It's highly doubtful that an individual Coinbase customer is insured up to $250K. Paypal, I believe, actually claimed at one point that its customers were insured up to $250K *each* and the regulators didn't go along with it.

@_date: 2015-01-13 17:54:19


You're confusing two different concepts.
*Broadcasting* a transaction on the network -- when it can be seen by the merchant -- takes very little time regardless of volume. A transaction does not need be included in a block for it to be seen by others on the network.
The 4 tx/sec metric you're referring to (and it's actually 7 tx/sec) is the maximum number of transactions that can be included in a block *the way the protocol is currently structured* with the 1 MB limit to each block. There are currently proposals -- increasing this 1 MB limit or making other changes to the protocol -- to increase the number of tx/second.


The vast majority of merchants today -- even brick and mortar establishments -- only wait to see the transaction broadcast on the network for "confirmation". There is an extremely slight risk that the transaction can be reversed before included in a block but that risk is negligible, and virtually non-existent if the transaction includes a mining fee.


You apparently have never run a business. Fraudulent chargebacks are an enormous concern.

Assuming the allegations are true (insert grain of salt here), MtGox and Silk Road are still two different entities. Just because SR's coins have been seized has zero bearing on MtGox and its customers. There is no allegation that MtGox's customers' coins were actually being stored in the Silk Road.
Even if MtGox was fraudulently transferring its customers' coins to Silk Road control where they were seized by the feds, that's merely another *civil* claim MtGox customers have against MtGox (which would be rolled into the pending bankruptcy proceedings).

Eh, Coinbase is adhering to the relevant AML/KYC regulations and likely making other assurances to the regulators. Even though it's an unlicensed and unregulated activity, Coinbase would not be able to operate openly otherwise.
That said, if Coinbase messes up -- say, its platform is used to move large amounts of "illegal" value or its cold wallet is hacked -- I'm sure the regulators will crack down hard. And that will be the end of the any unlicensed Bitcoin industry in the US.

I totally understand that. This does not seem like Reddit user content, though.
As somebody else mentioned, BC.i approves a tag *before* it is published on the site. Reddit admins don't approve anything before publishing (though the site seem may possess legal obligations to pull certain information *after* publishing... but that's unclear).
Also, unlike a Reddit comment, it is not known who submits tags to BC.i to begin with (not even a pseudonym is provided) so I am not sure how BC.i can claim the "third party" protection. For all we know, these tags can be "submitted" by BC.i itself and then published.
Regardless, it's irrelevant now; BitStamp admitted it was hacked. If there was no hack, however, I don't think it would be a clear-cut issue.
Also: BC.i may still not be liable for defamation even if the tag turned out to be inaccurate. There are exceptions/defenses the publication could fall under, most relevantly, that it qualifies as a non-defamatory "opinion".

They hopefully want to be as accurate as possible. They admitted to a "compromise" and shut down the service. Both of which are good steps IMO.
A "compromise" may mean many things. A malicious actor may have somehow gotten access to a single hot wallet address's private key (sort of bad) or the seed to the entire hot wallet (really bad). 
Or, best case, it could even be an "inside" job by a white-hat hacker paid by Stamp to try to break the hot wallet... to, for example, test how long it takes for Stamp's staff to notice a breach. That will qualify as a "compromise", as well.

FinCEN ruling you're a virtual currency money transmitter does not necessarily mean you need state-level licenses. "Money transmission" at the state level may or may not mean whatever FinCEN says the federal definition is. In Texas, for example, "money transmission" only covers the transmission of legal tender. On the flip side, even if FinCEN says you're *not* a money transmitter under federal regulations, your state regulator may still insist on a license. Ostensibly, federal MSB regulations and state money transmitter regulations are concerned about different things: the feds about money laundering and other financial crimes, the states generally about consumer protection.
FinCEN's ruling means this company has to appoint an anti-money laundering officer, institute an AML Policy, collect certain info on customers (especially when dealing with high-value transactions), file suspicious activity reports, etc. While it's a pain in the butt and expensive, it does not automatically mean the company needs a state-level license to just have customers.

This is inaccurate. Being a money transmitter under *federal* FinCEN guidance may have little bearing as to whether you're a money transmitter under certain *state* money transmission laws.

Possibly. The tellers are essentially acting as their own BTC-fiat processors. While what the tellers do is P2P on the Abra network, they aren't doing it for themselves, but to process a customer's transaction.
While I'm sure they will claim and have a legal opinion that says this is merely a series of private transactions, that tellers are essentially acting as middlemen for two parties trying to send each other money, regulators may claim that's within the scope of MT laws.

Um, right...
Considering a contract to do anything illegal is void as a matter of public policy *today*, I'm not sure what exactly his point is. 
"Contracts" to do many illegal things are not even in writing to begin with to avoid the whole police investigation problem... so why would they even want to move to a smart contract platform with a trail that can be audited/investigated? You'll still need the exact same number of police to investigate illegal verbal contracts. Gangsters aren't going to start publishing their contracts for killings or heroin shipments on Ethereum.
Also, you'll still need lawyers to actually come up with the terms of the smart contracts and determine whether a smart contract was entered into fraudulently, etc.

Facebook's creation of content (or relative lack thereof) is irrelevant: it owns all of the content its users place on its platforms. 
Also, Facebook does create content -- its trademarks and its "look and feel", for example -- which is quite valuable as long as its users continue to use its platform.

It means people coming of age at the turn of the millennium.
So people born 1980 and after are generally considered Millennials, though those before 1985ish overlap with GenX. Generally more comfortable with technology (barely remember a time before computers and the Internet were ubiquitous). 
The 2007-09 recession defined the older cohort of the generation; just getting out of college or grad school to get crushed.

Many credit unions also use the big banks to actually hold their money...

It depends. There is more than one level of OTC markets and many brokers stay away from all but the very blue of blue chip listings, generally overseas public companies who don't want to go through SEC headaches. It's unclear where the BIT will be listed.

Did they take this poll before or after they asked their parents they needed more money?

You have rights. But you have to claim them properly or you lose them.
The 4th Amendment only protects against illegal seizures of *your* property. If you claim the property isn't yours, then you don't have the right to exclude it. (That's at least the law according to the Supreme Court.)
Ross can't now make the argument on appeal "oops, I admit the property is actually mine and now I want to exclude it and have a new trial". You don't get two bites at the apple. He's stuck with his losing argument for excluding the evidence.

If you're actually an attorney, then you'd know criminal proceedings have nothing to do with the truth, they're about justice. Regardless of the actual "truth", the evidence against him for breaking these laws was damning, which he knew from the beginning. He willfully threw away arguments that could have freed him in favor of a "truth" which he couldn't even make a single juror believe constituted reasonable doubt.

Seriously? Wouldn't you like an actual person at Coinbase to spend some time looking at your account to make sure the computer reported it accurately rather than having it (along with all of your personal information) sent in a rush to the state? Errors happen all the time and more errors happen the faster you try to do things (which you would know if you had actually run a business).
All other financial reporting requirements have deadlines of at least 30 days to make sure the report is accurate and has been reviewed by somebody.

Worse than that. You must report transactions involving one person (apparently living anywhere, not just in NY) in one day in excess of $10K to Ben, whether or not the licensee suspect illicit activities. Big traders, day-traders and anybody just wanting to cash out largish portion beware.

It shouldn't make a difference, I agree. But it does. Probably because the Supreme Court only pretends to care about an individual's constitutional rights while actually doing everything possible to increase the power of the state to trample over them.
Illegally obtained evidence should be excluded, period, regardless of whom it belonged to. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:49:34
This is not unusual for financial regulations, in general.

Ross was found literally with his hands on a laptop keyboard in the SR's admin panel. He alleged in his motion to exclude ALL evidence against him was discovered through an illegal search and should have been thrown out. Which might have been a winning argument but he didn't claim any of the evidence was his. Instead he claimed that all actually belonged to Karpeles...which was idiotic.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:19:26
Problem is that Ross can't challenge how the evidence was obtained because he refused to admit the evidence ever belonged to him. It was a strategic error which possibly cost him at the trial court and will definitely cost him on appeal.

BFL filed for bankruptcy protection in December, did it not? (I see articles saying it will but nothing saying it actually *did*.) 
Assuming it's in some sort of bankruptcy liquidation, the bankruptcy trustee is selling everything s/he can to pay off the company's creditors. It's not good or bad. This is just what happens when a company goes bankrupt.

Not really. While "suspicious" activities of any value are reported (and are probably being over-reported out of paranoia), only cash transactions in excess of $10K must be reported.
But these filings are generally only made to *federal* authorities, not state; it's very unusual to have a state require these things, too. Not entirely sure what NY would even do with this AML-related information. 
The $10K+ in transaction reporting requirement also has an absolutely insane 24-hour deadline.

I think they're going to appeal the pre-trial rulings, saying that it should have been dismissed or evidence thrown out on statutory or constitutional grounds.
They had crap for a defense at trial and, like you said, I don't think there were any serious procedural errors.
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:52:36
Doesn't matter. By refusing to admit the property belonged to him, Ross threw away the right to challenge its seizure by the government. You need to have a privacy interest in property before you have standing to exclude it based on current 4th Amendment jurisprudence.
Edit: link 
@_date: 2015-02-05 05:13:02
Ross's legal strategy was crap. That's as simple as it was.
He threw away decent constitutional arguments at excluding some of the most damning evidence against him in favor of dramatically muddying the waters with that idiotic "Karpeles may be the Dread Pirate Roberts" argument.
He'll lose on appeal.

He forgot the second half of the tweet where he said focusing on Bitcoin will make him filthy rich.
(Not saying he's necessarily wrong; just that he has a huge self-interest in saying this as CEO of the largest Bitcoin-centric company.)
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:14:14
Ross asked for an evidentiary hearing in his motion to exclude. Since he didn't have standing to ask for the hearing, we'll never know what would have been uncovered.
