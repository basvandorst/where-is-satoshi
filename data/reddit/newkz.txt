I guess the main point would be the Anarchist part, I don't really care how a stateless society looks, as long as every part of it is voluntary. Anarcho-Capitalism was what I was introduced to, and what I think makes the most sense in terms of voluntarism. It seems to me that it encompasses the other schools of anarchism as well, since people are free to do what they agree to with each other, as long as it does not break the NAP.
If people want to make pseudo welfare state in a free society, then they are welcome to do so, as long as people are free to leave if they so choose. I might even choose to join such a place if I lived in a free society, but I don't want it forced on me, it has to be my choice to stay.

I guess it introduced me to libertarians, a label that practically nobody I heard of bears where I live (Denmark), the most economically right-wing we have here is called Liberals, which I don't think is used for the same sort of people here as it is used in America. But it's a weird chain of events that put me on the path so to say.
My feminist sister said something about MGTOW on facebook, and I looked it up to see what the hell it was, found their subreddit, found a video with Stefan Molyneux arguing with some feminist, and I was very intrigued by his rational dismantling of her arguments. I watched some more of his stuff, and the topic of anarchism came up multiple times. At first I thought he was crazy because that was the automatic reaction to what I perceived as right-wing bullshit. But the arguments were not irrational to me. So after after some time I decided to read his books on the topic and they pretty much convinced me of the moral reasoning behind it.
It's still very new to me, it's not more than 6 month ago that this happened, so it's somewhat hard to break the the old way of thinking in some cases. I guess Bitcoin and specifically this subreddit with some articles lighted a small flame by introducing me at least, though I would reject it in the past :)

Yea, I don't agree with that, which is why I would not fit that category :)

Exactly my question! .. Amazed that I had to look this far down the comments to find someone that would comment on it :P ... The 2 on the right look especially young if you ask me.

I got interested in Bitcoin when I was still a statist (Socialist, in my case). Because of the nerdy side of it, the political implications was not a factor. I would now consider myself an Anarcho-capitalist. The political implications are now interesting too, but the source of my interest remains the same :)
My political views did not change because of Bitcoin.

I've not been following the Bitcoin community for 3-4 years, and only just gotten interested again since this scaling debate seems from my perspective to be reaching absolute insanity, at least here in reddit.
People here seems to be assigning motive to the BU side and Rogers in particular that seems absolutely ridiculous, and I have a hard time taking it serious, but sure it could be entirely true. It just seems too stupid to be true. 
I've seen a few discussions / debates (that includes Rogers), and the BU vs SW seems to be no more than a difference of opinion, but every one here treats the BU side like they are trying to destroy Bitcoin. I don't know if SW or BU is the right answer, I don't know enough about either sides on a technical level. But the drama around this debate seems so overblown to me, and the vitriol towards the opposing sites is just insane.
But again, maybe the BU and Rogers is trying to destroy Bitcoin like everyone seems to think, but from what I have heard from their advocates so far, it seems like they want what (in their opinion) is best for Bitcoin.

From what I understood from the video in the link it does not require the removal of the supply cap. The argument as I understood it, is that you won't reach the free-market equilibrium while either the block size cap or the supply cap is in place and instead end up with a forced equilibrium.

Is the rise the market adjusting to the "correct" price or is this a bubble like last time. I guess we'll see in a few weeks.

Doesn't really matter, the reality is that GPU &gt; CPU for Litecoin, the difference gap between GPU and CPU is less than that in BTC, but it's still Massive.

Your point being ?
@_date: 2013-05-29 09:38:05
Absolutely not.

Indeed, this article is 100% offtopic, there is nothing interesting related to Bitcoin in it. Mods, please close it.

It's a very interesting article and I love it's principles.. But being a Socialist, I don't see how the libertarian entrepreneur would be able to provide things like Free Education, Healthcare, Police and other "Essential" society needs, a central government have a say in it. I Live in Denmark, and while all our societal systems does not operate to perfection, it provides all of these things and more for "free" (through taxes of course). While I'm hopeful that an alternative could exist that would produce the same results, I can't see it for me. Anyone have any thought of this ?
I don't know if I missed the point completely but that's how I read it. And I recognize that while a solution to this might not exist now, technology or other factors could have evolved in the future to make these things feasible. Like Bitcoin and other crypto currencies might be the solution to the current "Banking Problems"
Sorry if this is too Off-topic from a Bitcoin standpoint.
