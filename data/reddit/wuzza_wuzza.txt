The Linux example is why I wonder why so many in this community are adamant that Bitcoin, at its base architecture, has to compete toe-to-toe with Visa as a payment system, otherwise it's a failure.
Bitcoin has a good chance of being a global digital bearer asset that can't be censored. It just has to continue being good at that one thing. A large ecosystem of revolutionary financial services could be built on top of something like that. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:17:42

It's still significant that both Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt (Executive Chairman of Google) called Bitcoin a technical "tour de force", regardless of whether or not they think it will succeed in the long run. It's a positive appraisal of the technology from influential people.

"I have one million bits."
The idea is that in the context of digital money, "bit" will be understood as being 1 millionth of a bitcoin. Bit used to refer to money in the past so it's not without precedent.

Dogecoin isn't welcoming to me, because the community uses mock-asian speak as an immature inside joke. I know that most people don't realize it, but it brings up painful memories for people like myself who had to endure that kind of mockery as a kid.
I like Bitcoin because it's more culturally accessible (not an obscure inside joke based on a meme) and plural (not racist). That's more welcoming in my eyes.

Yes I find it very strange how people make an exception for that kind of profit making. Some of the early investors in internet infrastructure and businesses became filthy rich, and they're praised for it. "They saw an opportunity and they knew when to seize upon it!" 
We happily use the network that those people helped to build without bitterly complaining how rich they got, even though we will never be able to reap the same rewards because we got in "too late".
 Yet *this network*, Bitcoin, isn't allowed to have early investors benefit from it, because that's not equitable. It seems to be a huge double standard.

Why does that matter in the slightest? It is an actual genuine block size increase to about 2MB which is what the Classic team was even aiming for.

Fortunately, Core has a plan to increase the capacity, starting in April!
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:32:41
It is **not** a third party system. It is a caching layer that is composed of native bitcoin transactions. Get your facts straight, please.

Maybe a command-line switch and a UI element with a couple of confirmation dialogs...

Bitcoin takes a *long time* to fully comprehend how it works and to grok the interplay of incentives as they relate to the different actors in the ecosystem. It's not easy.
 So many techie types read the whitepaper and then come in here to argue all sorts of concepts that they don't quite get. My personal favourite is the misunderstand of the longest-chain-wins rule.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:33:07
Yeah... and Core isn't suggesting a POW change (it's coming from others in the community) so what's your point?
@_date: 2016-03-13 04:05:31
Luke, do you see any solutions for the mining centralization problem, irrespective of block size? For example, changing the algorithm, increasing the block rate, or maybe even switching to proof-of-stake (*ducks head*)?
@_date: 2016-01-01 02:38:41
Well in that case, why not with dogecoin? It has ten times the capacity!
Ah yes - the answer is simple: money is a network, and for money the network effects are particularly strong, and Bitcoin's network effect is accelerating away from the altcoins.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:25:27
Sorry, but you can't copy the network effect. Bitcoin earned its network effect over 8 difficult years, small win after near-death experience after disaster. Countless contributors worked *hard* to get Bitcoin working, get it talked about, and to get it adopted by people all over the world. You don't just replicate that by switching to a different coin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:53:40


Exactly. Because it's true.

It would also be a nice way to reboot the mining distribution.

wow... with that kind of community support, the miners are basically inviting the community to route around them by not signalling for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 03:16:07
I think so too. This is an opportunity for businesses, exchanges, and users to come together and 1) Resolve to put this BU impasse behind us and 2) Figure out how to activate SegWit without the participation of the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:46:38
It's a deeply technically intense issue, and takes a long time to understand. It's more like an attack from a mining oligarch and altcoin investor than it is an election.

You keep saying "as designed", when really it's just your opinion.

It's believe that he controls upwards of 40% of the hashrate, perhaps far higher. So yeah - there's your authority.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:44:40
He was good for Bitcoin in the early days, and I still believe that he *thinks* he's doing the right thing, but he's out of touch with the reality of what Bitcoin is actually capable of doing while retaining censorship-resistance, and with the financial damage he's causing or will potentially cause to users of the system who aren't rich like he is. 
And now he's bent on pursuing this quixotic Bitcoin Unlimited project to its fiery end, fueled by what appears to be a bad case of bruised ego. It's sad to see it come this. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 17:50:51
It's worthwhile to take the time to read the scalability roadmap that is supported by most of the core developers. They're making it work as we speak.

"Core" didn't make any such agreement though... I wonder why this keeps getting repeated.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:39:19
Yeah... just a minor hack to prevent the entire system from screeching to a halt from a quadratic-time hashing attack. Let's get rid of it!
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:46:32
If we have to make a choice, I'd rather the Core developers be excellent coders and thinkers than great communicators. 
The system is still chugging along because of the efficiency improvements they've made to the client software - a technical *tour de force*. The TPS capacity would be far lower right now without that.
If Core needs better communication, then maybe the Bitcoin business community can create a fund for a PR rep. Core isn't a company and needs all the help it can get.

LOL! He's critical of Gavin and Hearn's approach to resolving the block size issue, so he *couldn't possibly* be the same Szabo who's been routinely lauded here over the last few years.

I used to run a node on Windows 7, and I still want to, but Bitcoin-qt keeps corrupting the bloody block index every time my PC reboots, and the rebuild takes forever while causing shitty machine performance. So I gave up and don't let it auto-start anymore.
The other problem is that it's not easy to set a bandwidth rate limit. 
I believe that more people would run nodes if the Bitcoin client just ran unobtrusively and reliably in the background, consuming no more than about 100GB of bandwidth per month by default.

It absolutely is meant to be a currency. It can be transferred within the Ripple system, and has the advantage that it's an actual asset, not an IOU. 
If the trade of IOUs never takes off, OpenCoin hopes that the exchange of XRPs will keep Ripple relevant as a straight Bitcoin competitor. 
That's why Ripple as it's conceived by OpenCoin is bullshit. They weighted the distribution of XRP in their favor. It's completely unfair.
