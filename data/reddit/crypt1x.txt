You should at least be able to view it. Getting the contents may be a bit tricker without your private keys.

Exactly. Bitcoin will, for better or for worse, go down in the history books and it's great to be part of such an exciting time.

Your mother will go down every evening for 1 Satoshi.

Yep! Like it or not, the bitcoin core team has simply been at it longer and has a larger development team and support system. To place blind trust in anything is risky, but given the hundreds of alternatives I choose BTC any day.  
Anyone can brute force block size increases. It's safe to say that the core team are looking for a more scalable, elegant solution and I respect them for it.

I agree that their team is fantastic but it's kind of apples to oranges. Two very different coins.

That's why they keep doing more successful lightning network transfers? Cause they're doing nothing? 
Go back to the BCash sub, troll.

What you just said is speculation,

You're assuming that robots would need currency to survive. 
Unlike us, robots simply need power, be it solar, electrical, thermal, or hell... go all matrix on it and have them use human beings. (Which I believe was electrical/thermal power in the movie.)
If robots DO take over, humans will probably go back to a gold and rare metal based system as our computers will either have turned against us, or be too compromised to trust.

Yeah I've been banned from r/BTC for months now because I said 'I mine BCH sometimes and I'm ashamed of myself' 
They told me I'm not a miner, I'm a shill. And then banned me.

Vers a fucking idiot, a felon, and a rapist. 
Such an assclown.

He managed to sue most sites but I think if you google hard enough you'll still find a newspaper article about the rape accusation.
