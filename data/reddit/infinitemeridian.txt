We're in a bubble for sure, the question is how long will it last and will it rebound afterwards? 
I believe the average drop in the past is about 40% - so if BTC rises to 20k and then bounces down 40%, it'll still be about 12K. 
I'll probably get Downvotes for suggesting we're in a bubble though, people here are too overcome by the hype. 
Coinbase is fine, especially with a small amount like that, but if you're planning on going larger, you should invest in a hardware wallet like Ledger.

You're limited on a weekly basis for every exchange I believe. So you could either just wait a week, or spread out your selling across multiple exchanges. With that many BTC though, you'd still probably end up waiting.

It's not 11k, 10909 from where I'm looking.

Does that mean we would have to wait until we get it to sell it? Like, if it goes up to 20k then crashes at 5k once I get it, I've missed my opportunity to sell at 20k.

Yes, see this article below:
Basically, you paste that address that generates into CB and it will send your currency to your Ledger wallet.

Unfortunately, most people are in it for the latter, which is why we're decades off from BTC being a viable alternative to fiat money AND why we're in an impending bubble at the moment.

This is heavy manipulation of the market, you can see that interest in BTC is still at the same level.
