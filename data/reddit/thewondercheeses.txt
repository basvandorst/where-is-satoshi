There is, it's called Godcoin, max supply 1. Some guy got it in ICO and is a Hodler of last resort

You're just having a wobble,  ok alts may or may not have a resurgence but btc halving is pretty much short term now, there is not going to be any major exit from bitcoin at this point. People wouldn't be that brave in any numbers

Can someone explain how a hardware wallet is 'my keys'? If all my accounts can be restored with the 24/25 word key they must be stored by Ledger somewhere online? I am trusting them to co own my keys?

What if he time locked them from himself (to assist will power and allow market to grow) then when they are released he cashes out to fiat? Ie one long scam from the start? I dont think this is the case but is a scary possibility

DCA out when things start rising properly?

Sure stories yesterday were talking about someone moving 30k bitcoin and consolidating with their other 40k or so. Is this just known holders?

The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it's profitable to continue the illusion. At the point where the illusion becomes too expensive to maintain, they will just take down the scenery, they will pull back the curtains, they will move the tables and chairs out of the way and you will see the brick wall at the back of the theater.

In this context I'm trying to reference the opportunity to own / control your 'money' directly,  rather than have decisions of others impact your wealth.  Of course right now Whales, and Satoshi as potentially the ultra-whale, are influencing the price. But in the long run .......

Is that good or bad (price wise)?

Adopt. Imagine if the UK went to Bitcoin standard as part of brexit, only way that's going to play out well

Perhaps not scam but personal greed rather than  the equality for all, no one should have too much of the pie ethos.

Is he constantly buying more shitcoins to keep the ratio up?
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:04:53
Wouldn't they approach large miners and buy directly? Probably with a consistent mark up

I think bitcoin is 'safe' ie not going to zero for this halvening then the next. Then unknowns around miners rewards and other tech may kick in. I wouldn't tie them in for more than 4-5 years, would be terrible for them to only know they had them whilst value was tailing off

I know what you mean, but Hodl has found a cultural resonance. It's a call to arms.  It's a defining mentality. We are here, we know, and it's for the rest of the world to catch up

Bit I dont get is why they are not doing this now just in case. The whole industry is worth less than Apple, a large bank could easily bag itself 10% of all bitcoin ever. First mover takes it and sorts them and investors for a few hundred years, all other banks on the back foot.

I dont have coding experience but have been Product Managing/Owning for a few years. If anyone seriously wants to investigate this idea further I'm happy to be involved in fleshing out the design, test etc

Some sort of inheritance, unexpected death fail safe for private keys. People wont store large proportions of their wealth as Bitcoin without this safety net. Rough idea would you store half my private key and I give the other half to the relation/inheritor. You store the inheritors contact details and release the key to them if I dont confirm I'm still around every 6 months or so (configurable, with several warning notifications etc) lots of add on features, multiple currencies, multiple inheritors. Flat up front fee or monthly subscription.

Are hardware wallets fundamentally hot wallets? If you lose your ledger you can recover to a new one with all your coins of different types. These key details must be external to the device somewhere?
