Yes. They destroyed 30M tether that is in their possession.

Finally somebody pointed that out. It's astonishing that it takes an hour and 20+ comment for such an obvious mistake to be pointed out.

Since almost all exchanges are flooded with people (and the support tickets that came with them), a lot of exchange have open support positions, and some offers remote.

The problem with quantum computing is that quantum computing will bring some of those "essentially non-existent" coins back, into the hands of the owners of quantum computers.

Then your stance on this would be effectively the same as option a in OP's post. Have a new chain, everyone move to it, then leave whatever that's on the old chain to rot.

The future market can affect the spot market. Usually, the future market's price is in sync with the spot market, whenever there's is any difference, people will arbitrage between the two, and that's how future market affects spot market (or vice versa).

Yes, I would like you to prove it.

No I don't have twitter. I don't see a reason why a proof for a prediction you made in the past should be communicated privately. Would you like to tell us why such a proof needs to be private?

These are valid concerns indeed, and I think the Bitcoin developers will one day need to face these dilemmas.
My opinion is that your option a and b are pretty much the same, since both of these will "burn" those unconverted coins. So, the most significant decision that the devs will have to make is what we'll do with unconverted coins, to burn them, or to leave them as it is and be "mined" by quantum computer.
While both of these options have its own pros and cons, I think we are still far away from the time when we need to make these decisions. We'll need to at least wait for the result of NIST's PQCrypto competition, otherwise we don't even have a candidate algorithm for the quantum proof address, and picking one algorithm right now is not going to work because those new post quantum encryption algorithms are not scrutinized enough so that we are sure that they work well. Anyone who tells you that their coin is quantum proof and it involves the use asymmetric ciphers is pretty much of out their mind.
After we've a good post quantum cipher, we'll still have to evaluate the status of SHA2 annd RIPEMD's preimage resistance, because when that fails, the amount of address (and coins) affected by quantum computer is much larger, and this will change the pros and cons of the big decision.
Therefore, there's pretty much nothing that we can do until the mathematicians and cryptographers sort things out, all that we know is that there's that big decision to make (to burn coins or not), and the transition is going to be a bigger change than Segwit.
EDIT: Fat fingers.

Quantum computers can break Bitcoin's PK crypto (ECDSA), but it's not yet available. So what the OP is assuming is that Bitcoin will have a new BIP to introduce a new address format that use quantum-resistant public key crypto, and everybody will move their funds to the new quantum-resistant address, just like what happened with Segwit. There's no problem up to this point. The real issue that the OP's asking, is what's going to happen with those coins that did not move to new quantum resistant wallets?

Fiat: 1 USD to 5 cents in 100 years
Crypto: 100 years? That's too damn long! Hold my beer.

I don't think everyone who understands Bitcoin will become a hodler. Some who researched enough may conclude that it's a bubble, or doesn't believe that it scales enough to warrant such a price, thus would oppose owning any bitcoin, or even decides to aggressively short it.
Anyway, researching about bitcoin doesn't guarantee one to become a supporter, and not every nocoiner lacks understanding about bitcoin.
