They probably went off what their antivirus showed them, most miners out there is just marked as a Bitcoin miner by antivirus software even if it mines alts. Most likely just an innocent mistake. Either way it isn't blaming Bitcoin, it's not the coin it mines that's responsible this will be hurting the devs of that emulator

Tbh I'd choose gold because there isn't much speculation involved in how much it's going to be worth in 10 years since it's established already but btc could go anywhere so if im looking for security it's gold all the way but if I'm looking to take a chance to get big it would be btc

I'm sorry, I lost all interest in it when it said that the claims of the study I posted were groundless.
Also it being done by a clearly biased group doesn't help

This is bs idk why you posted this Bitcoin mining is literally accelerating global warming, the report isn't even that old it came a few months ago
