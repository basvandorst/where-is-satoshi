They need to cover hardware costs so there will always be a vig on the price. You pay for the convenience of using cash and not having to go through KYC/AML. When it's legal for a store to sell bitcoin for cash with nothing but a mobile device, then the exchange rate will be much closer to market value.

You're wrong. With a high number of nodes and intermittent hardline connections (towers) it could support 10X the bandwith of current home internet connections. The nodes at homes would be as powerful as a top of the line Wifi antenna. No danger to anyone.

 Howell trashes £3.8 million-worth Bitcoins
By 2009, James Howell from Newport, England, United Kingdom, had accumulated 7,500 Bitcoins but was unaware of their worth. His virtual currency collection was worth £3.8 million by 2013. However, to Howell’s horror, he had spilled a drink on the hard drive that contained the Bitcoins and trashed it. After learning the value of the Bitcoins, he made desperate efforts to recover the hard drive from the local junkyard, but failed to locate it.

Since giftcards are basically electronic money, this makes total sense. The current legacy giftcard system is ripe for disruption and currently filled with gaping security holes ripe for hackers. The blockchain can secure these cards. If stores want to ensure the funds are spent with them, they can use colored coins, multisig or other safety measures.

My speculation as I know a high level Dish employee and have had many a conversation with them.
Dish will put transponders on outside home satellite dish installations and offer crypto-based credits to their users for participating in the network. T-Mobile will fill in the gaps with towers. They would save a ton with less reliance on renting extra tower space. Then a super fast wireless broadband/cell network would be self sustaining. Auto manufacturers will install Sling player options instead of DVD players in cars. Goodbye XM. Cars will also house signal repeaters and boost the network for crypto-revenue. T-Mobile cell phone users could connect directly to each other to repeat and boost signals in busy areas. Call it...
Boom! (Drops mic)

Thanks for your reply.
So basically I can burn 54 satoshis (+ fee) to write to a transaction using OP_RETURN with 40 bytes of data into a permanent transaction? This seems ripe for use in proof of ownership. You can't spend the coins, but you can prove you own them and whatever is in the OP_RETURN field. Like deeds, car registrations, identity, iPods, anything. 
Q: When/if the block size is increased, will the OP_RETURN field size increase?

Bad practice to enter your personal information for a donation to a charity organization? It's just because they want to keep in contact with you to support their organization. Coinbase and other wallets have algo's that track all transactions that go through their service. It's the law that they do. So I see nothing wrong here. People are smart enough to know that if you enter info into a form, it's captured and you will be emailed, direct mailed, called, etc.

"single public key" = SEED PHRASE. It's not an actual "key". It's BIP39 not BIP32.
From the developer:
"All those 12 words do is encode a 128bit "seed". From the seed you can generate any number of "private keys". Each "private key" has corresponding bitcoin address that can be made public without revealing the key. Your wallet is just a collection of keys, and those keys are all generated from the same seed."

Well written post. But I think most people's problems we with Case is the firmware and lack of open-source code to review. Also, the user should be given the choice to hold the third key and disable the fingerprint scan and replace with a pin, 2FA or other security measures that keep the user in 100% control of their funds. I don't see much innovation with Case over Trezor or using a dedicated app like Breadwallet or Mycelium is easy enough. THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH PLACES TO SPEND BTC YET!

There are constant major discussions here about the money supply and bitcoin. If you don't like them, just down vote. 80+ people think this one is relevant. Democracy at it's best.

That quote is written by someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin and bitcoin have to work together. And that Blockchain technology is Bitcoin technology. He started with the "volatile" comments. Seriously, silly.

So companies now will steal extra electricity from their users who will have to now configure their coffee maker to their wifi network and hog up bandwidth, etc. They just need to bribe the govt. to keep Energy Saver stickers on.

Minimum 54 satoshi's per transaction right now. + Fee. So millions of TX could boost the price, once the network and block size issues are figured out. Automated and algorithmic scaling built into the next hard fork seems like the best idea I've seen.
You don't need a clearing house to do this. Anyone can do this. Also, if you use OP_RETURN the satoshi's are burnt.
But I heard that you can just use multiple outputs with OP_RETURN and burn 0 satoshis on the additional outputs. Much confuze.

I think my $3 donation wont raise any flags. And all the org would have to do to accept a large donation is declare it. the IRS wont harass you if you declare everything and pay whatever taxes are necessary.

Because devaluation of fiat currencies is everything that bicoin is against. Its a very common theme in this sub. There is a lot of discussion to be had about hyperinflation, QE and other Govt. currency manipulation that has a direct effect on all of us.

Counterparty assets to assign ownership bypassing traditional channels.
Programmer - Create a wallet that can trade digital assets with info stored in the blockchain.
Photographer - QR codes embedded to prove ownership
Video editor - Check out Streamium and develop for them
Skateboarder - Design and sell deck stickers and other skate swag
News enthusiast - Share the shit out of Bitcoin great articles
Car enthusiast - Get bitcoin accepted by EZ Pass and other toll processors. Or just make stickers and create a new version of WAZE on the blockchain so people can see the history of traffic, accidents, etc on a public database

Can I use the data field in a bitcoin transaction for whatever I want? Will it be embedded in the blockchain forever? WTF is pruning?

If Litecoin is already pegged to bitcoin's price. Why can't it just be used as a payment channel? Just need  an exchange algo or open source API that will do the exchanges instantaneously. The microTX and block size problem will be fixed. BTC for the big TX, LTC for the small ones.

Just use any dice you want to create a random string. I use all [these]( to create a 10-20 char, string. Then put the result in brainwallet. I write down the string, verify it and store it safely and encrypted. I also use these in bitaddress.org for BIP38 passphrases.

They are owned by the same people. So this is just paving the way for PalPal/Braintree to integrate. But will still take all their huge fees and such.

Citi just could install miners into all their branches for a distributed network. But really it's a centralized distributed network. But what if they offer perks to individuals to mine their coin. If they were the first, and users could get free miners to participate, then it could be a major Bitcoin competitor.

All major banks hedge their currency holdings to offset risk. It's the foundation of the entire derivatives market. Bitreserve will probably get bought and consolidated after the next BTC bubble.

Sent funds at 4:00pm. Didn't receive notification until 4:39pm. Emails should go out as soon as transaction is sent. All other wallets send instant emails. (i.e. Coinbase, cough cough).
Also, not to mention their crappy overvalued exchange rate with padded fees.

The blockchain has tremendous value without bitcoin. It's called a database. Oh wait, already invented.

Circle has major problems.
1. You buy BTC and it stores it as the $USD value, and you can't change that. Annoying.
2. It uses it's own conversion rate which is usually higher than market.
3. You can't easily just send BTC without calculating the conversion amount yourself to make sure it's correct.
4. No posted conversion price.
5. Poor transaction history
6. Same 3-4 days for cash withdrawals to your bank.
7. Instant buys are great but not great exchange rate as the "no-fee" is bs and the price is just padded.
8. iOS app is slow
