Why make cars that run on gas and create CO2, when we can make cars that run on unicorn farts and rainbow power.

This. I can handle my portfolio losing value but it always does hurt a lot more than you think when the price goes down. See how you take it

I know we all can easily tell the difference because we all follow bitcoin. But do you honestly think normal people will understand these things? There will still need to be some sort of “bank”

I think scaling is a part of the high fees. Even if its not, no one wants to pay more than 10 cents for a transaction fee. I see bitcoin dying because I can pay 2 cents with dash and have money in minutes. Bitcoin is $5 and wait hours sometimes
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:28:45
What? Isn’t it the same company with same fees
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:00:39
Everyone refuses to scale. Don’t worry other cryptos that scale will be used instead 
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:54:30
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:54:26
I agree. Dash is where it's at
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:13:16
Yea don’t worry it’ll go through soon. In 4 hours the Network will speed back up
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:10:12
What time does it start?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:51:31
breadwallet is really nice
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:35:36
Next stop. 1 million 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:52:49
Yea they keep track. Click accounts and then there’s export or something. Just look up how to get tax data from coinbase

Lightning network progress. Fees are out of hand

It'll get refunded if it doesnt go through in 14 days I think. Not 100% sure. but it will be refunded if it stays stuck too long
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:51:46
Basically it says bitcoin is acting slower and a lot of people are using it. So your transaction will take longer.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:12:42

$50k? Why so low?
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:57:10
Of course they will support it. Might take a few days for them to get to you though. But they do the hard work (splitting and having a separate wallet)
