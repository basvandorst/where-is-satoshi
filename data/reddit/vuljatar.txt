Enough with the shitposting. Fucking *enough.*
To be fair, this is the funniest shitposting I've seen in a while. But seriously, enough... take it to @_date: 2018-11-16 10:16:12
And yet they literally banned his REAL ACCOUNT briefly because they thought it had been hacked when he started talking about bitcoin.
So fucking sloppy.

Idiots will always panic-sell. The history of Bitcoin has proven that.
Idiots who panic-sell will always wish they hadn't. The history of Bitcoin has proven that, too.

I mean *what the absolute fuck are you even trying to say?* I get that you're incapable of understanding that I'm discussing the name "Bitcoin" **and nothing else,** but your last post was downright incoherent.
@_date: 2018-04-19 22:30:16
That son of a bitch won't be "redeemed" until I and all the others who had bitcoins stolen have them returned.
Until then he's just an embezzler on a colossal scale. He should be in prison for the rest of his life.

"not malicious"
This piece of shit committed fraud on a massive scale and you call it "not malicious"? Are you insane?
@_date: 2018-04-29 05:38:02
Can someone translate this gibberish into english?
@_date: 2018-04-05 01:23:03
Why aren't you rotting in prison for the rest of your miserable life, you thieving piece of shit?
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:51:20
People who don't understand what the big deal is must be missing this part.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:56:46
Oh, you're a troll. That's disappointing. Fine, I'll waste my time replying one more time.
"Bitcoin" is a name. When the hard fork happened and the majority went one way and the minority another, that name stayed with the majority. Bitcoin is--by definition--Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is it's name. Nothing else is Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. It is not Bitcoin. For the purposes of the name, any and all debate about the contents of the white paper and Satoshi's "original vision" are meaningless.
**Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.**
Now, this is a subreddit for discussing Bitcoin. So if you want to discuss Bitcoin Cash, I suggest you go elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:39:05
What are you talking about? Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:08:12
Pointing out those lies is useful, informative, and **completely different than the majority of the Bitcoin Cash related content on this subreddit.**
This thread here? This is a perfect example of a useless shitpost.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:57:23
It's a genuine question, based both on your dedication to shitposting that contributes nothing *and* your inability to understand the word "comprises", and confusing it with "compromises". Perhaps you should look it up and see what it means, you might just learn something, if you're capable.
@_date: 2018-04-29 15:29:57


That's the problem, because you are lying to people when you do that.
How are you incapable of understanding this? How stupid can you possibly be?
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:44:48
Christ, you people are idiotic. GTFO and quit sabotaging the crypto community.
@_date: 2018-04-28 16:22:04
You really are retarded, aren't you.
You are incapable of grasping the fact that "Bitcoin" is a name, not some sort of title bestowed by the divine right of "what Satoshi intended".
Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:44:29
BitcoinCash is only "fake Bitcoin" when people incorrectly claim that it *is* Bitcoin. It is it's own distinct cryptocurrency, and the level of vitriol between the two shrieking fanbases is **fucking insane** and does nothing but harm cryptocurrency in general.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:04:46


I agree, that is extremely important, and the people perpetuating the lie that it is are the problem--not Bitcoin Cash itself.


Trolls shitposting about it benefits nobody. Informative posts that are relevant to Bitcoin--such as pointing out instances of people trying to mislead others by calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin"--are not shitposting, *are* beneficial, and are absolutely necessary in this subreddit.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:49:38


I've got bad news for you then--you're blind.


Their misinformation campaign is certainly a problem, but doesn't excuse the massive volume of retarded shitposting that this subreddit is drowning in.
@_date: 2018-04-28 06:12:23
And the trifecta is complete. Thank you for proving my point. For the sake of the human race, never breed.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:33:17
Shitposting like this comprises about 1/4 of the threads on this whole subreddit.
Take it elsewhere, you fucking retard.
@_date: 2018-04-28 05:45:52


Serious question, 100% serious--are you actually mentally challenged? If so I'm sorry I called you a "retard"--that's just bad taste.
If you aren't mentally challenged, how old are you? You seem to have an elementary-schooler's grasp of the English language.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:17:15
Why are you fucking retards wasting everyone's time with anti-BCH shitposting? And how the fuck does this garbage keep getting upvoted?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but this subreddit is supposted to be about BITCOIN. *How the fuck do any of us benefit from idiotic circlejerk attacks on another cryptocurrency??*
