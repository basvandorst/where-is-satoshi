Everyone is speculating on future use and the hope that BTC comprises a large amount of global transaction value someday. I accept BTC on my e-commerce site, but that's only because I'm bullish. What we really need are efficient derivatives that can help large merchants mitigate the volatility risk in holding it. I personally think of BTC as digital gold, rather than a currency. It will never be used for regular everyday purchases, but for transferring large amounts of value. I'm perfectly fine with it being solely a store of value, as there are other cryptos that will be superior for more regular transactions.

BTW, BTC derivatives are already here.

He probably bought it without having funding USD wallet first. Coinbase will allow you to do this and lock in the price, but you won’t get your BTC until the bank wire is completed. If the funds were already on the exchange, then the transaction would have been immediate. Typically takes about 5 business days for deposited funds to arrive on Coinbase.

If we are talking about lights out, then BTC=0. If we are talking about dollar collapse, to the moon. Stock market crash, Depends. If we start to see deflation (Strengthening dollar) then could put a lot of downward pressure? I see a strengthening dollar over the next couple of years, simply due to the amount of dollar denominated debt around the world. Companies making money in their native currency then have to buy dollars to pay down the debt. A s the dollar strengthens, the debt becomes more burdensome, leading to a feedback loop of a dollar buying panic. The thing is, this is a new asset that has yet to show the world how it truly behaves.

I think of BTC as digital gold and not a currency. I think that other cryptos will be better suited for everyday transactions, whereas bitcoin will be better suited for larger transaction values. Think of it more as a monetary asset in the same way that gold is. Nobody uses gold to pay for anything, yet it is still considered money as a store of value. BTC Is far more speculative, and many people are just in it to try to make money. Others are betting on it being used either as a regular currency or for  storing and transferring large amounts of value. I see the latter as the most likely scenario for BTC, which is perfectly legitimate, and I don't see BTC's success necessarily being tied to it's widespread everyday use.

Exactly, no ones gonna share an unstoppable trading bot. Especially when there’s cheaper capital anywhere else. So obvious here.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:48:11
I can't wait until BTC has liquid options! My preferred investment tool. I'll sell premium all day.
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:15:11
Definitely a Ponzi scheme! Stay far away. They’re doing nothing but paying off the old investors with new money coming. Oldest trick in the book. That being said, you might be able to get out before it collapses, but do you want to risk it, and would you feel alright knowing that you profited from a scam?
@_date: 2017-09-30 00:58:52
Bitcoin will never be widely used as a currency, and any vendors who accept it are only doing it for either publicity, or because they themselves are holders. The sooner that people realize this and accept bitcoin for what it is (digital gold), the better off we’ll be. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:01:19
I get it, but if you are looking at a chart, you are dealing with closing prices regardless (candle to candle) even if it's only visual. It would be nice if the percent change was consistent with the opening of the candle. The time it changes doesn't really matter, consistency does. I get what your saying but this has nothing to do with censorship or middlemen. In this instance, having a closing price is nothing more than a tool to help gauge relative change. Everyone would know it was arbitrary. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:20:59
The solution is to abandon the blockchain and buy IOTA.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:20:45
Those contracts have termination dates fixed in time. In this context, there is a closing price for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:07:26
Interesting read. I haven’t looked into bitcoin options yet. It would make sense to me to have everything settle in fiat. You could easily have a derivatives market with a thousand times the notional value of the real market without having much impact on the real market price. Nobody wants to exercise anyways. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:02:06
There is no difference. I honestly don't know why coinbase wouldn't just keep your balance available on either site, the transfers are free and instantaneous. I suppose they're banking on people not transferring their funds so they can collect more fees. When I deposited funds onto gdax, they actually showed up in coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:53:56
To each their own, but it would be nice to have the option. 
Disagree. It's far more natural to have a closing price when looking at daily candle charts. If your not into looking at charts, then I would agree with you. I don't believe in technical analysis, but I still like to look at a chart.
Not sure what you mean by this. We're talking about the perception of relative price movement. How does that have anything to do with fiat vs. crypto? A ridiculous statement. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:35:47
Good pont. I see BTC as a new and improved form of gold.
@_date: 2017-10-02 01:10:30
wouldn't you rather have another 46 years and the potential to make billions instead of millions?
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:00:12
Right on! I do disagree that the increase in BTC has to do with USD devaluation, and more to do with massive liquidity injections from central banks in general, and the fact that it is a novel new asset class. As of now, I see 0 positive or negative correlation to USD.
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:09:55
Exactly, it's gold 2.0.
We are in a speculative phase, and many see the volatility as an attractive opportunity. Ultimately I believe it will smooth out over time, and we won't be seeing anywhere near the same level of price swings. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:41:17
Is this a trick question? No one would take the blue pill.
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:48:44
Agree with all those saying bitcoin should be thought of as gold. It is a monetary asset and imo will never be widely used for everyday transactions as a currency. That job will fall to other cryptos. In no way do I see the success of BTC relying upon its utility. A speculative store of value is a perfectly legitimate use for bitcoin. I think it will mainly be used for larger value transfers. The more people that HODL, the higher the price will ultimately go. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:28:51
Here’s another perspective. I have an ecommerce store that accepts bitcoin. I don’t convert it to fiat like most do, I’m a holder. However, I disable the option to pay with bitcoin after the price spikes, and I wait for it to settle or sell off before again enabling it. I bet you see more merchants selectively choosing what to accept day to day as prices fluctuate. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:17:41
I thought that was only if they have ever sent funds from said address. I suppose your right though, it would need to constantly change.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:18:52
Of course it is, but I think it's fair to say that the reality lies somewhere closer to one side. Based on current usage, it is definitely more of a store of value. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:25:15
The coordinator is the main concern for me, and I recognize the risk. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:04:22
The creators words don’t determine what it is. The market gets to decide what it is. The overwhelming Majority here seem to think of it more as a speculative store of value. It’s a perfectly legitimate function. Of course, it can be both. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:39:57
No I’m not. But the hashing algorithm was designed to create collisions without the use of the central coordinator. It was supposed to be there to sabotage a copycat scam, their thinking that any solid developers would recognize it. Those collisions were what the MIT researchers found. Am I wrong to say that’s a sort of boobytrap?
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:43:08
You probably won't get any of your money back.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:10:20
You probably have the most unique response. How would you define it's value, purely speculative?
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:48:33
A Ponzi scheme is where they take new money to pay out old investors directly, and disguise it as legitimate market returns. I believe BCC to be such a scam, but not BTC. To be fair, any type of investment asset is sort of a pyramid in that it rewards those who get in early. Another type of pyramid scheme that’s running rampant right now (it’s not quite recognized as illegitimate) are the MLM’s, a type of recruitment scheme disguised behind a product. The  monetary incentives are to recruit and shove a ton of unsellable product upon hopeful newcomers while misleading them about the realities of market saturation and the endless chain fallacy. Anyways, bitcoin is neither of those things. It’s a speculative monetary asset. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:53:31
It’s a crypto coin that uses a DAG instead of blockchain.  It is more lightweight and organic. The developers designed it to intrinsically solve all of the issues now being faced by blockchain tech, such as scaling and fees. With IOTA, there are no fees and there are no miners. All of the tokens were created at once. Instead of paying a fee, you do POW on two other transactions, thus the more the network is being used, the stronger and faster it becomes. POW could also be outsourced. They are focused on the internet of things and machine economy. With 0 transaction fees, micro payments become possible. It opens another world. Some of the developers are also working on building ternary processors and IOTA was coded in ternary. There is a lot of FUD on this coin, due to the ternary coding, new hashing algorithm and boobytrapped code. There is also the use of a coordinator, which it needs as training wheels until the network grows. It may be a gamble, but if it works out, the implications are huge, even a threat to most cryptos. My largest holdings are in IOTA, so maybe I’m blinded. Check it out and decide for yourself. What I mentioned is the tip of the iceberg. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:32:49
Because it’s fun. Try it out. Don’t worry about the network fees lol. Seriously though, try it for the novelty factor. But yes, you are right. I can imagine a crypto economy where people are incentivized to spend coin after a price surge, and merchants are incentivized to adjust their payment terms in such a way. As a merchant that accepts and hodl’s, I’m not just gonna take it at any price. I disable btc payments after a spike like we had the other day. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:05:07
Just not true. The value of BTC is not correlated with the depreciation of fiat. It will NEVER replace fiat. You think big governments would allow that? Also, it sucks to use. Bitcoins value is 100% speculative and not tied to any fundamental factors other than its newness and novelty. That being said, I think the price will continue to go UP, but don’t be confused in thinking that everything else around you is depreciating in value. It’s not.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:08:25
Transactions are instantaneous if your money is already on the exchange. I’m guessing that you bought the BTC without having deposited funds to your USD wallet first? Unfortunately there is not really a quick option, since the delay is being caused by your bank where the funds are coming from. My strategy is to constantly be depositing funds to my Coinbase USD wallet, and then I have money available on the exchange  when I want to enter the market. BTW, you can avoid the Coinbase fees by using GDAX, but you will need to have your USD wallet funded first. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:34:02
My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:37:37
Yes, as a vendor, I disable being able to accept BTC after the price spikes, and accept it again after it settles down. Of course, I'm not exchanging immediately back to fiat, but a holder.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:13:56
I absolutely agree with your well articulated reply. A speculative store  of value is a legitimate function. My thoughts too on money velocity and relation to price. If bitcoin were to become used as a day to day currency, the price would need to and or be forced to stabilize. Pretty much a flatline to what we see now.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:54:08
That alone should be with way more than 10 million 
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:07:16
Imagine how funny everything would be. Of course you’d also have to deal with parental bullshit again. You could however become one of the richest men alive fairly easy.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:15:44
Yeah, linking it to a third party payment system changes things. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 02:16:11
All of the highly specialized niches will eventually be built on platforms to use their native token. These environments will be much more valuable with their broader integration. Maintaining a strong edge would be essential for any highly specialized project to last. The last thing anyone wants to worry about is 1000 different exchange rates to operate their business. Just my opinion, but you bring up a good point.
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:28:19
If you buy with a credit card, your btc is available instantly, they will charge you double the fees of a debit card though. That's the price you pay for getting it instantly. I am always depositing money onto coinbase with the knowledge that my funds won't be there for over a week. It's best to wait for your deposit and then transfer the money to Gdax where you won't have to pay the crazy coinbase fees. I suppose if you couldn't wait to get your btc, then might as well pay a little premium to get the price locked in, or a little more to have your btc instantly. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:36:01
Are you asking about BCH (bitcoin cash) or BCC (bitconnect), the probably a Ponzi scheme? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:46:59
Pure crap. Bitcoin can easily be replaced. Do I think it’s likely? Not soon. But BTC will never be widely used. It will be more of a store of value while another crypto steals the show on transaction volume. Of this I feel certain.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:54:41
Those were my initial thoughts, but the fact that the collisions were found by the MIT team within minutes tells me that they were either placed there intentionally, or the developers are far more incompetent than people think. Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I'm going with the former. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:41:04
It is most definitely a Ponzi scheme. They are paying off the older investors with the new money coming in. If there actually was a trading bot, they wouldn't share it with you when there is cheaper capital anywhere else. The fact that you have to lock up your money should be alarming as well. This is just bad for crypto in general, and those participating in this should be shunned. Sure, you might be able to get in and out and make some money before it collapses, but do you really want to risk it, and would you be ok with profiting off a scam?
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:35:28
Only the most versatile or those with the biggest name. Any token that has too narrow a use case will probably not do well long term IMO. I'd stick to BTC, LTC, and XMR as the cash coins. But things like ETH and NEO have way broader potential. Also, there is and will be new technology. Some coins now use a DAG instead of blockchain. Something like IOTA probably has more potential than any other crypto if it achieves wide adoption. Just something to think about.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:58:59
I'm no expert, but I think people need to think critically. Too much positive reinforcement echo chamber mentality going on here. From a technical standpoint, bitcoin is already inferior to other cryptos. The real question is, how long can Bitcoin's name and network effect maintain its dominance. It has a lot going for it, don't get me wrong. I just think it's blind faith to believe that it's market dominance could never be challenged. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:50:32
Great to see a project without a redundant token. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:33:15
Exactly, I hate it when people argue that gold has intrinsic value. Bullshit, it’s just like anything else, it’s value is assigned to it by a collective story and agreement that it’s a monetary asset. The intrinsic value of gold is closer to the cost of mining it and significantly less than it is today.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:44:05
I see that you are using a Shopify store, and based on the text in the product I can tell that you use Printful as your fulfillment service. I've got the same set-up. I'm wondering if you know of or are working on a way to integrate other crypto payments into your checkout. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:11:52
IOTA is the best. Keep some of your funds in it, because if things work out it's gonna do well. It has changed the way I think about transactions. Of course, Litecoin fees are relatively low, so that's also an option for now. Once IOTA is on most major exchanges, it will be THE go to for transferring funds. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:46:24
Unless you are talking about exchanging for alt-coins, then probably no more than 1%
