They banned me for shipping mine to a paper wallet I generated using their website. So, I'm not sure they know what's going on...

That's the spirit!

I had been buying for years (maybe, a long fucking time in Bitcoin)
It was the only recent transaction I did there.  Bought coins. Shipped to paper wallet. Banned.

I like the theory that it is backed by the utility of the invention.  The concept of a block chain is so amazingly useful that the technological utility is enough to back the currency.
You can also point to the things it would eliminate, SWIFT, wire fees, title insurance, private voting tech, ... The sum of those things that a block chain makes cheap or easy provides very high value.
Edit: I want to add that I think the argument that "fiat is worthless too" is a waste of time. We're trying to convince them to change, so the onus is on us to make convincing arguments.

Ha, in other news, book reviews are still more legit than the Bitcoin Foundation

Ha, don't ask questions on unless you have asbestos underwear.

Calling someone who made a simple mistake stupid is a bug in the Bitcoin community.

Bitcoin is the most robust network though, which matters.

No kidding, especially if you pay US tax on that big transaction.

Yeah, I saw the concern trolling.
Real estate returns 20% on a good deal.  That’s a good investment, but it’s not wealth creation.
Let’s say you have $100k and you want to retire before you’re a million.  You can pick real estate and get there in 15 years or bitcoin and get there in 4 years (inflation adjusted).  There’s no comparison.  
A sane person would put a little in each so they have a better risk profile, but to avoid an asset class entirely out of the fear of the downturns is comically myopic.

If you don’t care, why are you gloating about missing the greatest wealth creation opportunity of our lifetimes?  It’s just weird.  If you bought in 2016, you would be doing great.

Short it if you have the courage to act on your convictions.

Technological utility is very high. Technologies that are useful have a way of sticking around, A/C, transistor, computers, networked computers... Blockchain is probably in that category and the most robust block chain is Bitcoin, so it would take a major event to change that direction.

It takes work.  Govt. bonds are entirely passive.
But he's correct, 10-15% is consistently achievable in real estate with little risk if you have enough capital.  There will be some work involved, though...

This is why people trust institutions to manage things for them. People gladly make the trade off between ease of use, reliability, and counterparty risk all the time and that probably won't change. They aren't inferior beings because they don't care about your favorite thing as much as you do.

Feels a bit like this:
