If you have Bcash assets, sell them. This scam is worse than "fake news". Seriously, drop the garbage coin and settle for a Bitcoin (BTC) worthy of it's own name.

We're talking about collectively investing into a decentralized economic platform. A paradigm shift in currency.
Our desire to give faith into a currency inherently makes us friends? Sorry, but no. I'm glad you feel a sense of belonging, and bought into the currency to raise my own personal investment, but seriously, wake the fuck up.
This isn't a game, it's the future of trade.

Winner, winner. Here is our problem personified.
It's a currency. Actual money. Serious investments for many involved, even larger for those putting their hopes and dreams into it. It's helping people make rent, buy homes, afford healthcare costs for their mother's terminal illnesses,  keep eating in a destroyed financial system (see: Venezuela), etc.
People's livelihood is definitely something to just "dick around" with.

I can't tell if you're trying to be serious or subtlety condescending. I'm hoping the latter.
These posts are just so super great and make this subreddit just awesome. I mean, I could just go to  and refresh the screen, but I'm super glad someone made such an awesome post telling me what I can look up in seconds.
OP, great shit. Please post whenever you see a price fluctuation in the currency. Your exclusive intel is vital, so please, whatever you do, keep it coming. For all our sake!
Edit: Oh, your post is obsolete. The price changed. Strange how that happens.

Thanks, will do.

I've been on this subreddit for years, held hundreds of great conversations that really helped me understand the entire concept. From how bitcoin worked fundamentally, how the blockchain worked, to running my own mining rig, to investing in ASIC miners, to finally learning the ebb and flow of the market so that I could invest at the right time.
For the 4th most visited site on the internet, you know is likely the main source of information, outside Wikipedia and YT videos, for curious minds to truly understand what they're getting into.
And it's exponentially being turned into a fucking joke. I'm only calling for some moderation and basic rules.

Last time I checked, 6000 does indeed come after 5400. I'll have to check with my sources, but I'm almost certain numbers work in that fashion.
