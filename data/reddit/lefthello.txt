As far as I know, all exchanges force you to sell if the price drops below a certain percentage from where you bought, unless you have enough funds to cover it. When people are gonna be  buying 10x+ leverage, there could easily be a swing that wipes them out, and you don't get a chance to wait for it to go back up.

It wouldn't be a reply, it would be a one-way thing. Kind of like when a website sends you a text message to verify you're the one logging in. Except you wouldn't need to enter any code, just seeing that the merchant received the "ping" should be enough to confirm that it's all good.
So if the merchant says they didn't get the message, then it means it would be sent somewhere else. The way I imagine it, is if the merchant's app confirms it got the ping, you can be *sure* it will go to the correct place when you send it.

This is a scenario where *everyone* is trying to manipulate the market, which is just as unrealistic as a situation where *no one* is trying to manipulate the market. Over time it should cancel each other out, leaving the natural price fluctuations. Price will still go up and down, because you could assume these buys and sells would not be occurring simultaneously.

Those wanting to dump must lower their asking price, until non-holders see it as a "good deal" to buy. The price drops until there are willing buyers.

I'm no fan of Roger Ver but this post uses a lot of rhetoric that makes him sound like some kind of terrorist. After like 5 minutes of research you can find what exactly he did, and make your own judgement:
There was a company making a "pest control" explosive/fire cracker meant to blow up pests (called Pest Control Report 2000). It contained 20x the amount of explosive normally allowed in consumer fireworks, about 1 gram total. The company at some point was ordered to stop making this product (not sure if this was before or after Roger's case).
Roger seems to have bought a bunch of these from a supplier (didn't make them himself) and was reselling them on ebay without a license, and illegally sent them through the regular mail.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:18:50

We REALLY need lightning network. It needs to happen before too many people get in. I know it needs to be ready, but seriously it needs to be done. Many many companies have failed because they wanted to wait until the product was perfect, and interested faded, and then it was too late.

"without enough miners, transactions couldn't happen fast enough"
Wrong. Doesn't matter how many miners there are. The protocol adjusts automatically so it would still take 10 minutes to mine each block regardless of the network hashing/computer power.

Overall I don't think it's a bubble. In the short term though? Maybe, probably. Wouldn't be surprised to see a crash down to 10k. But it might go up to 50k who the hell knows. We're getting weak-as-fuck hands in the game. People who are buying literally just because they heard "you can make money with bitcoin", and they'll be the first to bail when the gravy train stops.
It will bounce back of course, but the fact that we still don't have lightning network is making a crash inevitable if the only purpose of having bitcoin is to watch the price go up.

I'm considering this in the context of mass adoption. You need to understand how many incredibly stupid people there are out there. It could get to the point where merchant sites would require you to verify the payment with them before sending it, just so they don't have to deal with people complaining they 'took' their money, even though they sent it wrong. Of course, this would be work. But why not do something just because it takes work?

High fees make it so people don't want to make transactions. If we increase block size and fees go down, that will make people more willing to send, and therefore the fees would go up again. One could argue the fees will remain the same no matter how big the blocks get, unless you increase them massively.

Coinbase does allow higher limits if you ask, but I doubt they'd go from 10k to hundreds of thousands at once.

I know that's how it is now. But with a software update it could be possible with smart contracts or something, I imagine. Perhaps it wouldn't be possible until the lightning network is done. But I personally think something like this is *essential* for a system like Bitcoin where transactions are completely irreversible.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:58:32
Well it would be from you to them. I guess my example with the text message was reversed. The ping *to* them is through the network, while the "verification" is literally just you looking at the screen to see if your ping went through correctly, and therefore your transaction would as well.
If the response was also through the network, you're right, the thief could simply respond themselves.

If its an IRL transfer theres not really any way they would know. However, if they ever decided to dig or do an audit, they could look at your big cash deposit at ypur bank and ask where you got it, and demand income tax on the whole thing. If it's over 10k, your bank is required to report it

For big huge rallys like this I like to not look at the price at all. Actually, as hard as it can be, I try to not look at the price as long as I can stand it. If it goes down, it will have gone back up probably by the time I look again. And if it goes up, well then I get a nice surprise anyway.

The thing about the mempool, is if everyone stops using bitcoin because the fees are too high, then the fees will become cheap again.  That's also why a block size increase probably wouldn't help. If we raise block size, fees get cheaper, so then way more people start sending transactions that wouldn't have before, and fees go up again.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:27:53
Not really. One dude with a GPU and a node could basically run the whole network. The security comes from the fact that the more miners, the more difficult it is for someone to get a majority of the hashpower and take over. If you run the network with a GTX 1080, your friend could start mining with his Titan X and do a 51% attack.

Feel free to take the massive throbbing cock of the IRS in your ass when they see you deposit 1k into coinbase, then withdraw 20k some time later later without reporting it. Which your bank WILL report. If you dont know your cost basis, be ready to pay tax on all if it.

We've already seen amazing growth this year which I believe was actually a correction up. It reached where it should have been looking at log-adjusted plots, which forms a nice straight line. If it continues at this rate, it would go way above the historical rate. It's possible, but every time it has gone too far above that line it crashed. See: 
I'm not saying it's impossible, and who knows, it might even stay there because of permanent new interest. But if it does another 10x next year that would really not be a healthy increase.

For me personally, it's because of capital gains tax. If I sell my bitcoin now, even if I rebuy, it would be short term capital gains, and would be taxed at like 30%. That means to truly make a profit, I would need to be sure Bitcoin was going to drop 30% below what it is now in order to buy in. My math might not be exact but you get the idea.

**I watched the whole thing. This guy makes huge fundamental errors in how bitcoin works, so don't even bother with this dribble.**
To the uploader:
I don't see your point about the increasing processing power of the network. You seem to have things backwards. The mining power doesn't need to increase as a result of increase in difficulty, the difficulty increases *because* of the more mining power, so that they are mined every 10 minutes. We could keep the same exact amount of mining power as we have now forever and not have a problem. It just goes up because more and more people *want* to mine, not that they *need* to.
You then apparently use this misunderstanding to say that we would need to move to proof of stake, which it won't. Have you ever heard of the lightning network? Offchain scaling? You don't even mention these solutions. 
Next, all of bitcoin is worth $150+ Billion, not 15 billion. Bitcoin has more market cap than all other crypto-currencies combined. So your whole point about that is completely wrong. If it was a passing comment that's one thing, but you literally made multiple arguments based on this basic error, so you clearly didn't do any research.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:39:27

Honestly we should hope so, because up until now it's been closely following an exponential curve pretty closely. When plotted logarithmicly the floor is clearly a straight line: 
This is why I believe the 10x this year was actually a correction upwards. But if it goes way too high, it's gonna come back down to normal fast. Or it might not and just break everything on the way to the moon. If it continues as it has, it will probably 10x in another 3-4 years.

Yep, Coinbase and Gemini are the only exchanges that I know of that have true USD bank accounts for users who deposit their money, and it is FDIC insured. 
Almost all other exchanges that allow you to buy in with "USD" actually issue "Tethers" which are supposed to be equivalent to a USD, but they are NOT. You can only buy BCH with USDT (USD Tethers), not real money (I guess you can with other currencies). The second you send real money to these exchanges, they give you "funny money" Tethers.

I'll admit, I got scared last time and dumped a bit, but realized how silly it was pretty quick and got back in around the same price. Now I see the all this and roll my eyes.

Yep true. Working out and looking at your results builds huge confidence.

Not really. Each one will have 1/10th the value if they only gave you 1
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:08:43
Because no one has a crystal ball, and the answer depends on several factors, silly.
For example, even if we knew 100% that the price would tank 50% some time in the next 6 months, but then rise 500% over the next 5 years, should you buy now or later?
You might say, "well wait for the tank first, duh!" But you don't know how high it will go before it tanks. It might still even be cheaper now than it would after a 50% drop at that time. So it is POINTLESS to ask your question.

You're a dumbass. To get 51% of all bitcoin you would need to buy 51% of all in existence at the current price, meaning half the market cap. Ethereum has nothing to do with bitcoin. It's not even a cryptocurrency, it's a token. Go back to your little channel, no one cares what you have to say.

As far as I know, it's the only coin thats tried to takeover as the "real bitcoin". They tried and failed after the s2x failed fork. Now they tried another pump but the weak hands are gone which is why the bitcoin price isnt dropping. Let them have their autistic screeching.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:11:38
Let's say it's possible bitcoin is a "bubble", at least for the short term. Has there EVER been a worldwide bubble before? The dotcom bubble was basically all in the US right? Even "tulip mania" (which was probably a myth anyway), was only in one country. 
Maybe they think it's a bubble because it's rising so fast, but we've also never had something that literally the entire world is trying to get, and there's a limited supply. Even if it was a bubble, on a worldwide scale, it would be become the biggest fucking bubble you could imagine. When the whole world is involved, 150 billion is no bubble. People are comparing this rise to rises that happened within a much smaller context, but you can't really compare this.

It's possible. They might succeed, at first. But heres a thing to consider: Most people who own bitcoin now are enthusiasts. What do you think enthusiasts will do when the price goes way down? Probably buy up as much as they can. Bitcoin I think at this point has proven itself, so people trust even if it tanks, it will go back up. If it does tank from shorts, it will rebound eventually if not quickly.

True. But if they wait long enough, perhaps so many new users will have signed up, that the interest in this "new" coin could cancel out the selling. But based on this, i guess it doesnt make it a guaranteed win.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:18:36
True unless its a large amount, and you go to put that money back into your bank account. Theyll start digging into where you got the money.  Unless you never deposit the money you make from selling them, they'll find out. Not worth trying to hide it!
Now, if you were to SPEND the bitcoins, yea youre supposed to report that too, but if you didnt i dont see how they'd find out. You could just say youre still holding them, or "lost" them.
But the fact is, if the government thinks your evading tax, they will look for unusual big spending and purchases that dont make sense with your level of income.

People always point out tethers are minted during drops and typically then buy up and raise the bitcoin price to "save" it.  Is it not natural though, that a big buyer WOULD come in and buy during a drop? When else would someone buy if they knew their huge amount would raise it back up? 
If I had 30 mil I want to invest, I'd sure as hell do it when the price is tanking.  People keep saying how the big money institutions are going to enter the market "soon". I think they already have been.

@_date: 2017-11-09 23:16:28
I think the sketchiness comes from the secrecy. It's very obvious the Tether is being used to pump prices, and that isn't necessarily unusual if the tether is legit backed, meaning the bitcoin is being bought with 'real money' (therefore meaning it's real demand). But from what I understand, Tether says it would release third party audits, which it did only once in a way that wasn't proof.
There are two possibilities:
1. Tether is not backed by dollar, meaning bitcoin is being purchased with fake money, and these are artificial levels. Whatever consequence of that cannot be predicted (Will it be found out before the money is made back legit? Will enough real demand flow in from the hype to legitimize the pump's price? Will it crash the price of bitcoin?)
2. Bitfinex is simply re-investing their profits into buying tether and pumping bitcoin. In which case I'd say these pumps aren't necessarily malicious, but only as the result of huge buy ins.

Yea I used to follow both. I was new and didn't really understand much about the fork. They CONSTANTLY kept talking about how bcash was inevitably going to skyrocket any day now! And they were always wrong. Always. Then the post-segwit2x pump came, and they were SURE bcash would topple bitcoin, and were wrong again. I was always skeptical but kept wanting to hear both sides, but finally decided they were too nuts to not even bother listening to them at all.

I'm not so sure. Almost all noobs will be using an exchange, where replay protection isn't the user's problem. Also, I don't think any hardware wallets will support b2x until they have a replay protection solution. Not sure about software wallets, but I'd think they'd implement some kind of warning or something.
Plus, if someone doesn't know about the fork, well they can't miss the b2x coins anyway.

Not necessarily. Imagine this way. There already exists a certain number of botcoins and dollars. The bank has a certsin amount of dollars in their vault, and all the bitcoins are listed on the blockchain. When someone in your bank sends you $100, the bank doesnt physically move the money, they just assign it to your account. Bitcoin is ALMOST like a big single decentralized "bank" in that the blockchain holds all the account (wallet) balances. The blockchain is simply a list of who owns what.
Also, banks are only required to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, which is like under 10% of account balances. (Called cash reserve ratio). Fun fact: They don't even have this much, they simply do a practice where each night, they borrow (perhaps from another bank) however much they need to get above the 10%, then send that money out in the morning (called overnight lending).

Not a bad article.
TL;DR: Big institutional money won't kill bitcoin, rather it will reduce volatility so the price won't skyrocket anymore, and instead will grow more slowly. So no more 10x in a year.
I agree, and never expected another 10x in 2018, and anyone who did was very uninformed. I believe the 10x this year was actually a correction up, and the price is where it should be now if you look at many logarithmic prediction charts from years past.  I believe we may 10x again over the course of 3-4 years, which are still insane returns.

I don't know when the market will go back up, but I am practically certain it won't happen before tax season ends in the US. Too many people (myself included) who aren't sure how much more they'll need to pay in taxes, or how much they'll get from their return (if at all).  
I'm not saying it will go up after everyone gets their returns, but it definitely won't happen before.
Lots of people being forced to cash out to pay for their gains in December too, even if they're now at a loss.

Taxes are due April 17th, but you can file earlier, or later with an extension.  Tax refunds take anywhere from 3-6+ weeks after you file your return.  So technically April, but the dust will probably settle mid May.

I personally think the one challenge will be getting people to keep their bitcoins safe. Most people are clueless, and will be easy pickings for viruses.
This is why I think bitcoin ETFs will be SO important. It allows people to invest in ways they're familiar with, through vanguard, fidelity, e-trade, whatever, and not have to worry about keeping hardware wallets, backing up seeds, etc.

The new forks would all be worthless. The only reason this fork might have value (at first) is because there's a small chance it will end up being the "real bitcoin" (it won't).  You wouldn't have anyone who would want to buy each new fork, only sell.

I should point out to others, don't ever open more ports than you need to! It's fine to open it for a specific purpose, but opening all of them is basically like having no firewall, and bots will scan your computer for vulnerable open ports.
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:05:14
First scenario has almost 0% chance, because bitcoin relies on computers. Most people are computer retards, and there are plenty of places where its not practical to use a computer for every transaction

"Time in the market beats timing the market"
Yes, it is very possible the price will drop, but it is equally possible it will rise. If you believe the price in the long term will go up, enough to invest that much, it doesn't really matter when you invest.  If the price of bitcoin goes to 10k, the difference between investing your amount at $6000 vs $5300 would be about $1500 after the fact.
Personally, I don't see why the controversial fork would mean the price will go down. If anything, if people aren't sure which fork will win (S2X almost definitely won't), it's all the more reason to buy before hand, to have both, meaning price goes up.  Afterwards, people will be selling the loser, and buying the winner, meaning it will go even higher. That is my 100% speculation though.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:32:07
