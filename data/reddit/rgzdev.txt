It works now but it wasn't working earlier today, it changed recently.
Or something changed recently on my end.

Not gonna downvote you but InstantGang is right. Hardware wallets require trust. EVERY wallet does. I like bitaddress because is open source by design there is not even a compilation step.

I just opened it again and this time the cert passed the validation. This is the fingerprint 
Curiously it now redirects me to:
I don't remember this happening before but i didn't pay this much attention to the path before.

I would say so, specially in a hurry.

I understand your complaints about slow development speed and such, but Wallmart not using BTC can't be blamed on the people in this subreddit. Wallmart is your typical conservative corporation, they are not going to risk their business on innovative solutions for other people's problems. Wallmart will follow BTC when their customers move to BTC not the other way around.

I searched this subreddit and got nothing, i though nobody cared.

Seriously, I don't know how to say without sounding rude, and I swear I'm not trolling, but that was very broken English, I'm not sure I understood that.
What I got from that is that:
 1. China has better hardware?
 2. China has better connectivity? To *whom* may I ask?
 3. Great firewall. Yes, it is well known that China has a Great Firewall. But I was under the impression that the firewall would be a negative for Chinese miners, not a positive.


Well, if good hardware and connectivity are bad news for Bitcoin then of course it has no future. I didn't know China had any other advantages besides cheap electricity. (And, yes I understand why cheap electricity is an advantage for Chinese miners. I'm not THAT clueless).

The guys in the commit taking over, who are they? btc1? segwit? SOrry im new.

Could you please explain me why is an unlimited block size something the government of China would  want? Honest question here I'm trying to understand.
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:00:57


Whichever, I'm just grateful you aren't mad yet.


Okay, thanks for clarifying. The part that confuses me is why larger blocks changes anything in this respect. Faster hardware lets you mint blocks faster, this should be true regardless of block size. Small blocks or large blocks, the Chinese will always mint them faster. Isn't it?
But wouldn't a larger block size help miners outside TGF (the great firewall) to mint blocks faster since they get a longer chance to mint them before the Chinese even get them?






Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here.


Yes, yes, no disagreement there. I just wanted to understand why a larger block size would help concentrate power. Good hardware and cheap electricity will favor the Chinese **regardless** of the protocol, wouldn't it?

Is this you calling me mad? Mad as in angry or as in crazy?


Ah, I was afraid you'd think i was trolling but i though we were past that. Now you are calling me crazy. But is crazy the word you are looking for? Maybe you are trying to call me stupid?
English is not my native language, and I doubt it is yours, so I struggle to understand you.
Try to see this from my perspective, What I'm asking is *how* a particular aspect of the bitcoin protocol is related to nationality, and all I got from you is "JIHAN! FEAR! CHINA! FEAR! CHINACOIN JIHAN! CHINA FIREWALL JIHAN FEAR!". You sound deranged, paranoid, dogmatic, and --worst of all-- just as uninformed as me.
Clearly, I asked the wrong person. Sorry for wasting your time.

Ok, ok, but that's kind of repeating  the same claim in different words, what i want to know is HOW does block-size lead to China centralization. Wouldn't other miners just mine the larger size blocks regardless of nationality?
