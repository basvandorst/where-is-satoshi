Well I’m not merely talking about the walls, I’m talking about the overall balance. For the past couple weeks, the sell side of the chart was larger than the buy side. Today it is back to what it usually is: larger buy-side.

That’s only one difference. There is also the problem of debt and credibility. The way I understand it is this: if the fed raises rates, we might default on our debts and then the dollar loses credibility. If the fed doesn’t raise rates then it loses its value relative to those currencies issued by central banks that  issue bonds of greater yield than US bonds. Pretty sure the rates, and thus the bond yields, are greater in China and India than those in the US.

I went about a full year listening to each one of his podcasts as they came out. I think he is a good Austrian economist except for one key point, which is exactly what you said: he believes (or at least professes) that Gold is the only sound money and Gold is the only thing that can be sound money. I can't reconcile that with what von Mises wrote in the first couple chapters of "The Theory of Money and Credit," that ALL valuation is subjective, and the only reason Gold was used as money was because of its properties that made it suitable to be money. And then, of course, there's that video clip of Milton Friedman talking about a pure form on money on the internet. Ta da! Bitcoin.
So, of course I think he's wrong about Bitcoin, but I think I can sense in the way that he talks that even he might be second guessing his position. Of course he has to support Gold, that's his business after all... but he's got to be aware on some level that using an internet blockchain to trade Gold between vaults is just plain silly.

Agreed. All we need is for more and more businesses to accept BTC via LN, eventually it will be so much easier, and cheaper, to transact with Bitcoin, it will become common. And then we’ll see 100,000 USD/BTC.

I get what you’re saying about inflation. They certainly won’t print quadrillions of USD. Although, I’m not sure what the 60 trillion is. I’m seeing M0 supply of USD is around 3 to 4 trillion. But anyway, yes, countries leaving USD is a big threat. Would one of the reasons they leave be the fact that the yields on treasure bonds and bills is so low?

Okay, so you’re saying the demand/sunny is really represented by the part of the depth chart that is immediately adjacent to the current price (middle of the chart)? I suppose so. I suppose demand is “I want to buy it right now”, whereas the buy orders on the depth chart are “I will buy it if the price drops to X”

Well, in the audio, he makes some good points.
1. A piece of gold *does* have intrinsic value by itself. Even if you stripped away everything in civilization and you were on a stranded island by yourself... gold is still shiny and nice to look at. Bitcoin.... isn't. And, as long as you have a fire, you can melt the gold and shape it into something. Bitcoin... nope.
2. Bitcoin is not legal tender.

While that's true, I don't think that's what he was referring to. After all, he does prescribe to a more Austrian type of economic philosophy than any other.
Gold has inherent *utility* value.
1. decoration
2. rings
3. dentistry
4. gold is physically inside your computer which you use to access reddit.
5. used in medicine
6. used in aerospace

1.a) Blockchain! (doesn't count)

@_date: 2017-02-24 15:10:15
I'll write it again because apparently you didn't get it the first time I wrote it; regarding the notion that all valuations are subjective, "that's true" (I quote myself). That's one of the basic ideas of Austrian economics.
What Schiff is pointing out is that gold is highly valued (subjectively) by many people *because of its utility value.* It is a commodity that has historically been used also as a medium of transaction. This is why it is considered *sound money* by Austrian economists: because it is the only money that is founded on the traditional bartering system. It is BOTH 1) a commodity, and 2) a medium of exchange. Bitcoin is not a commodity, and can never be a commodity, therefore it can never be *sound money.*
a raw material or primary agricultural product that can be bought and sold, such as copper or coffee.
synonyms:	item, material, product, article, object;
a useful or valuable thing, such as water or time.
Now, concerning your list of uses for Bitcoin, 1) I don't think people are willing to barter for the opportunity to speculate... mainly because anybody with a thinking mind can speculate. In an analogous way, people do not trade valuable things in order to respire. 2) My understanding is that Bitcoin is not the network. The network is physically already in place (wires, communication towers, satellites, etc), and Bitcoin uses the network. So, I'm not sure what you meant by that. 3) "The ability to circumvent government controls" - again, not many people are willing to pay for that unless they are hoodwinked into believing that the government does control them. I'm sure you are already aware that the government does not control you; the movements of your body are entirely caused by you and nobody else. So, again, not sure where you were going with that one. 4) "Ability to... send Bitcoin..." - I can also send toenail clippings to people, but the ability to send them does not make them highly valued by a large quantity of people. But if my toenail clippings were a commodity (like Gold), then it would be valued by a large quantity of people.
It seems to me as if the only reason people are buying Bitcoin is because they want their government to establish a cryptocurrency--a cryptocurrency that cannot be depreciated by the usual causes of depreciation in traditional currencies--as its official (crypto)currency, and make it legal tender.
This is likely wishful thinking.
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:56:00
Yea i figured as much. But is it like: steepness in the bids + shallowness in the asks --&gt; price goes down; steepness in the asks + shallowness in the bids --&gt; price goes up??
Or is there no correlation between the shape of these lines and the price action?

OP titles his post "let's be realistic," then proclaims that Bitcoin will make us all millionaires.
Let's ignore the content of your post and just continue after the title: "let's be realistic" it's very possible that this Bitcoin experiment will fail for any one of a number of potential causes.

@_date: 2017-03-16 01:02:09
Hey, I never said to sell your bitcoins. Absolutely HODL!!! I agree with you. But that's precisely why I'm talking about increasing the value of Bitcoin. Just spreading the word WITHOUT selling your own stake in the cryptocurrency.
Just think about it critically, if everybody all at once decided overnight that Bitcoin was worthless (say they went insane) and the hashrate dropped to 0, the price would follow and go to 0.
Flip side, if everybody realized government issued fiat was for losers and idiots, and Bitcoin is the future, and they all started to trade in their cash for Bitcoin, we'd all be filthy rich!
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:09:48
There is no mathematical explanation of why BTC will, for sure, go to 1 million USD. The future is not deterministic. The physics community demonstrated this a long time ago.
@_date: 2017-03-16 00:28:35
But holding (sorry, hodling) does nothing!!! That works for stocks because the company has employees that work, and the company pays shareholders dividends.
Okay, technically speaking, hodling will produce a return based on the inflation of your currency. But if we want huge returns like we've been seeing, then new hodlers need to learn, and hear about it, and buy.

Nah, not that low. If they are disapproved then the SEC will have an explanation for why it was disapproved. The other two groups vying to make an ETF with then use that information to avoid disapproval when theirs are submitted.

Pretty sure that number is simply quoted in USD, I.e. the total VALUE of ALL GLOBAL MONEY is measured to be about 80 trillion USD. Now go plug that number into a currency converter and see what it is in your own currency.
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:20:44

They look completely different. What’s the point of this? To show us what bears look like?
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:12:55
Yea, I realize that closing channels is something that should be avoided, and it’s design should be such that it would be unnecessary, as you said. But still, it will happen, albeit rarely. I arbitrarily picked 0.01% of users closing a channel each day (originally was going to write 0.1%, but figured it would be rarer than that). But I’m sure the devs have thought of this long ago. Hopefully their design is such that transactions remain secure and reliable while hardly ever relying on on-chain settlement.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:57:10
Oh yes, I know all blockchains are in the same boat when it comes to transaction rates. But again, that’s a Lower Bound on the adoption rate. The blockchain also has to handle all the LN channel closures, or anything else that needs settlement, right? And that demand increases as the user base increases. So, by the time there ARE 1.5 billion users on LN, at what rate will channels be closing? Even if 0.01% of users close a channel each day, that’s a significant chunk of the blockchain’s transaction rate.
The LN and associated wallets need to be designed in such a way that channels are almost never closed! Perhaps I’m being pessimistic, but it seems to me like the base layer blockchain transaction rate needs to be boosted somehow.
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:59:16
Great article, thanks. Glad to read that there is so much development going on. If more technically knowledgeable developers are optimistic then I suppose I should not be as pessimistic. Still, an accurate back-of-the-envelope calculation that takes these new developments into account would be more reassuring, as handling day-to-day transactions for billions of people with full encryption and security seems so like such a daunting task.
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:46:35
Price? Perhaps. Value? Of course value and technology are related.
@_date: 2019-01-21 00:30:29
While I too am excited for Lightning Network, I have developed some skepticism after reading somebody’s post detailing just how long it would take to get everybody ON the network. An on-chain transaction is required to get on the network, and the blockchain handles only 5 tx per second. At that rate, if every transaction was dedicated to getting people onto the LN, 24/7, it would take 10 years to get 1.5 billion people on the network. That’s REALLY slow, considering the fact that that’s a lower bound, and a more realistic time is much greater.
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:01:19
Same here. The moment you realize the beauty and power of Bitcoin is almost like a religious conversion. Anybody who claims to understand what Bitcoin is, but can’t relate to the hype, truly doesn’t understand the technology or the nature of fiat vs sound money.

I see. Yea I'm just struggling with the concept of "limited supply." With precious metals, there really is a limited supply, and no efforts on the part of mankind can change the supply. With cryptos.... there is a theoretical infinite supply, despite the code which sets the supply of one particular version of one particular coin at 21,000,000.
EDIT: only one thing can change that, which is mass adoption by the human race of only one particular version of one particular cryptocurrency. If the entire human economy used only one version of one crypto which was limited, then changing that limit would require a majority of the human population to desire that change.
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:36:37
In my experience, users do not get the actual private key. We do not control the wallets, we control our Coinbase account. This is why I made a cold storage wallet and moved 1 BTC to that wallet. Can't hack that.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:12:38
I understand that. But the limit of bitcoins could, technically, be changed. If the whole earth forced the developers with the threat of death to change the limit, it could be changed. This is a real distinction from gold, albeit an unlikely scenario.
EDIT: a competitive alt coin might be one whose limit is in some kind of meta code,

Not entirely precise: buying on margin is when you borrow money from your broker to buy a larger amount of stock than you can pay for. Effectively: borrowing to buy more of a financial instrument.

@_date: 2017-05-21 20:56:36
THE REASON THE FEE IS SO LARGE IS BECAUSE YOU ARE MAKING SUCH A SMALL TRANSACTION! If you were to make a purchase of, say, $1000, then the fee is $15.00, which is 1.5%. This is the same as when you buy gold; no big-league seller of gold is going to give you a small 1% premium on a purchase of $10 worth of gold. Never gonna happen.
My advice: quit complaining and buy larger amounts of Bitcoin at a reduced frequency, e.g. instead of $50 each week, do $500 every 10 weeks, or $500 each time there is a big sell-off.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:08:32
No kidding, how many times are you going to say that? All I'm saying is that matching the "mania" phase of that drawing with the recent price spike is not an inappropriate thing to do given the information provided by Google trends. That is to say, Bitcoin has never ever ever ever been more popular in any week in history than it has during this current week. Therefore, this is a fact which is supportive of the OP's proposition.

@_date: 2017-05-26 01:03:36
I get what you are saying. But, I think this *might* be comparing apples and oranges. My understanding is that the great depression involved an overvaluation of financial securities (stocks). But, their are mathematical metrics which indicate how much a stock is over- or under-valued. E.g. quite simply the P/E ratio. A stock that is trading at a 500x multiple either is accomplishing something that is extremely difficult to quantify due to its enormity (e.g. Tesla) or is overvalued. But, in all cases, stocks are valued in a currency basis. I.e. distance is measured in meters, mass is measured in kilograms, pungency is measured in Scoville heat units, and any particular stock's value is measured in currency. Perhaps estimating the value of Tesla is akin to a 16th century Spaniard debating with his friend about the distance to India by traveling West. The most intelligent and informed Spaniards may have a much better estimate of the distance than a layperson, in the same way that a highly accomplished executive at a hedge fund may have a much better estimate of TSLA stock than an arts major buying it with his allowance "cuz it's Elon Musk, man!"
But, how do you measure the mass of one kilogram? Any physicist worth listening to will tell you that the mass of a kilogram is defined by a standard which is kept safe in Paris. It's basically a big rock, the mass of which is the definition of one kilogram? What is one kilogram? *points "that rock."
In the same way, how do you measure the value of a currency? Do you see? That is not the question one should be asking (unless, of course, the definition is a standard which is kept safe in Heaven). It's like asking, which social media platform is the most social? One could argue that the most social one is the one with the most users. But, of course, Facebook beat out MySpace even though MySpace was the first mover and was more popular.
So, when one asks "what is the value of 1 BTC?" it's more like asking, "which social media platform do *I* want to use?" Something about Facebook appealed to human beings more so than MySpace, which is why Facebook is more used as a social medium, and more talked about than MySpace. So, really, when one questions the value of BTC, or if one questions the hight of a Bitcoin bubble, one must step back and ask, which social media platform is more appealing to humans? Bitcoin, or fiat?

The ledger is distributed across millions of network nodes, so there are millions of records that wallet abc has xyz Bitcoins. All you need is the wallet address and it's private key to access its funds.

Preaching to the choir over here. Why do you think I asked also for the investor's rationale for their allocation? Anybody can say "I'm 80% in Bitcoin," but I'm not going to care about the number unless they have some extremely compelling information about why they chose such an allocation.
Thanks for looking out for me though. I appreciate it.

Actually, if one considers the popularity of the "Bitcoin" keyword as calculated by trends.google.com, this does make sense. According to Google Trends, Bitcoin was more popular this week than it has ever been.

No, I completely understood that. And I agree with the notion insofar as it relates to the stock market. When even the shoeshine boys, who get paid nickels, are spending their small amounts of income on shares of stock instead of saving it or spending it as they should, then of course society has gone off course in investing far too much in the stock market and it is surely a bubble.
But I maintain my position that this anecdote cannot be extended to the present Bitcoin situation. That's like saying, "You know it's time to sell [money] when Shoeshine boys give you tips on personal finance." Again, money (meters) vs. share of a corporation (distance). Money is not a thing that is sold, money is the measuring stick people use when they buy and sell.

This is a dumb comment, IMO. Investing is a real thing, just watch shark tank. There is a reason the word is in the dictionary: because it has a meaning. People just need to learn how to use the word correctly. It's correctly used when referring to something like buying shares of a company. Trading one currency for another isn't really investing, it's just trading one form of money for another. Plain and simple.

This was not meant as a big project. Also, the lack of survey takers is not something I can easily control on reddit. If I could somehow survey every single person that owns bitcoin, I would, but I don't know how to do that.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:12:28
Interesting situation.
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:51:24
This is actually my feeling, almost exactly. I just don’t advertise it much on this subreddit because everybody here talks about traditional asset classes. But really, you’re right. Many people distrusts banks, and more people are waking up to their QE and manipulations, inflations, etc, not to mention money laundering. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has been increasing by orders of magnitude, not merely single or double digit percent returns.
Bitcoin will be the new gold in this digital era, because it’s the longest standing and most widely used decentralized ledger—Permanence in an ever changing digital landscape.
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:45:03
Maybe in that short 10 minute drop, but from the peak to the bottom (8388 to 6600), that’s a 21% drop, which is common but not like a daily or weekly occurrence.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:09:15
when was this?
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:03:27
Oh, trust me, I got a logarithmic chart of BTC price since its inception in Excel, with fitted polynomials, trendlines, etc. I KNOW we're closer to the bottom than we are to the top, which is why I'm watching the price like a hawk! Yea, I shoulda bought more a month ago. But, relative to the surrounding time period (+/- about two weeks), Bitcoin is technically at a very overbought level right now, which implies that it's probably advantageous to be patient and wait for a less overbought level to buy more.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:55:24
Perhaps I should have written, "safest compared to other methods that are equally simple and fast." I can't think of a method that is as safe as investing in Bitcoin and is at least as fast and as simple as investing in Bitcoin. What other methods are there? Extremely leveraged investing in the stock market? Starting one's own company? Robbing a bank? I don't think any of those are as simple as investing in Bitcoin.

You're pretty close. I think you may have read too much into what I said. I didn't write that *any* person that invests in Bitcoin could become a member of the upper class. Just that people will, and already have, transitioned from one class of society into a higher class (where class is determined only by wealth) by trading a significant portion of their fiat savings for Bitcoin. And a question was posed to the reader: have you realized this possibility? Is this what you hope for yourself?
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:49:50
What’s your problem dude? I ask a legit question and you give no common courtesy, and accuse me of being a scammer? Dude, I’m just a 20-something white guy who’s into science and tech, and I’m asking a question that’s been on my mind. Take a chill pill.
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:28:17
No, just the way Chrome decided to print to .pdf. The results are so stupid anyway, people on Reddit don't know what they believe on Bitcoin. Basically, people expect that the price will hit $2000 by 2018, but they don't believe it will hit $5000 by 2020, and reject the notion that it will hit $100,000 by 2030. But simultaneously, they believe that bitcoin will be the dominant cryptocurrency in 2030, and they also believe that someday in the far far future all fiat currencies will be obsolete and we will all be using cryptographic blockchain...
... but Bitcoin won't hit $5000 by 2020, no that's just absurd. *rolls eyes*

Okay, again, perhaps you should re-read what I wrote. I didn't say Bitcoin *needs* our hope in order to be adopted throughout the world. The question was not about Bitcoin. The question was about you. You.
Do *you* put so much hope in Bitcoin? Do *you* realize that it could propel *you* from one class of society (in terms of wealth) to the next?  
And, no, we are not 100% sure that Bitcoin will make it. Physicists aren't even 100% sure that general relativity is the best model that can explain gravitation. We aren't 100% sure that there won't be a solar flare in the near future that knocks out our communication and electrical grids.

A polynomial equation is an equation of the form:
y = Ax^a + Bx^b + Cx^c + ... + constant
You can fit any equation you want to data in Excel. Simplest example is a linear regression line fitted to data that resembles a linear relationship.
I fit a polynomial equation to the “bottoms” of the BTC price chart, so as to see where the support is, and where it will be in the future.

Hey man, I'm buckled. Wish I had a greater sum of funds invested in that buckle, but it's buckled.
And yes, I'm aware of the 4-year cycle. That's part of the TA. It seems foolish to expect that the price of Bitcoin will hit an ATH *before* the halving. The last time we were approaching the halving it was a similar situation: hit a bottom and then doubled, from $200 to $400, and hit resistance at $400 and fell back down to $300. The peaks in the year surrounding the last halving are plotted along a line (on log scale). Extended, that line is at about $7000 today.
Why would Bitcoin continue to increase at the current rate, and in so doing, hit an ATH just a few short weeks  from now (well before the halving)? The market has NEVER behaved that way. Ever. Never ever.

What are the security and life cycle concerns?

Cold storage is free. Just find a site that will generate a wallet (address and private key). Save the HTML site to your hard drive, disconnect your internet, open HTML file and generate wallet. Save wallet info (address and private key) in an offline location (piece of paper, thumb drive, etc). Then transfer Coinbase bitcoins to your wallet address.
