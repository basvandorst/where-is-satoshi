It's because we have betrayed and angered the cryptomarkets with our frivolous spending, and the cryptomarkets fought back, saying "enough, no more gains!". But pointing fingers at the squeamish, amateurish types, get-rich-quick types, types not knowing that this is what BTC does as it goes through growing pains gets us nowhere. So stop finger-pointing, @_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:41

 Hallo,
  
die Bitcoins sind angekommen, vielen Dank. FÃ¼r einen derart treuen
Kunden werde ich gleich morgen - oder genau genommen heute, denn
Mitternacht ist schlieÃŸlich bereits durch - in der FrÃ¼he zur Post
gehen. Doch am Heiligabend wird da nicht mehr viel passieren, und nach
den zwei Weihnachtsfeiertagen folgt der Freitag und danach das
Wochenende. Vor Montag wird die Ware folglich wohl nicht ankommen. Nach
dem Versand Ã¼bermittle ich aber unverzÃ¼glich den Code zur
  
**Außerdem möchte ich dringend davon abraten, Bitcoins auf Mt. Gox zu
halten. Die sind gehackt und praktisch pleite! Würden nicht ständig
neue Bitcoin-Einzahlungen durch den Arbitragehandel vorgenommen, wäre
Mt. Gox sofort erledigt. Deshalb: Alle Bitcoins abheben, oder in
Fiatgeld tauschen und auf ein Bankkonto Überweisen lassen.**
  
Da ich bezÃ¼glich der Lieferform keine Reaktion erhalten habe, werde
ich die Tropfen nicht umfÃ¼llen. Und natÃ¼rlich sende ich
OriginalprÃ¤perate statt Generika.
 
Viele GrÃ¼ÃŸe!

Here's the plan 1. Sponsor Balotelli.
1. Let him wear a ~~Bitcoin~~ Mt. Gox T-shirt underneath his jersey.
1. Let him get a red card for showing the T-shirt.
1. Red card causes Italy to lose the important match.
1. Publicity.
1. Massive BTC dump.
1. Buy cheap BTC.
1. Repeat.
I think the biggest hurdle will be for Balotelli to put on the T-shirt.

A friend of mine has been trying to get proof (PICS or GTFO) out of OP for about 6 weeks. He kept receiving shitty posts from OP claiming that "[His] proof was on the way", but it started to get difficult to believe. Well today, he claimed to finally have received all of it.
I understand that this might be an isolated case, as the exact cause of the delay is still unknown (might be completely unrelated to OP's faggotry). However, the fact remains that he did receive his proof, and that some of you in similar situations might receive yours too.
As much as we like to blame OP for every bad thing that happens in the world, we have to keep in mind that sometimes, "your proof is on the way" actually means it.
Good luck everyone. All hope (for some of you) is not completely gone.

They aren't "missing" 1200 BTC, these coins are partly lost and partly stolen.
Lost due to the banktruptcy of AurumXChange, which was due to the [shutting down of Liberty reserve by the US government]( due to money laundering.
Stolen due to [a hack in may 2013](

Satoshi was pretty vague about his distrust of the FED.


trusted third parties to process electronic payments**. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the **inherent weaknesses of the trust based model**.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
Not the FED, just financial institutions in general.
Which in the bitcoinosphere are still not to be trusted, e.g. Mt. Gox (if you're not Chinese), FXBTC (if you're Chinese).
