How long does a GBP to BTC exchange take?  The 0% bank account option says 3-5 days, is that accurate?

It's ridiculous isn't it?  I've had to turn off suggested sorting (for anyone who doesn't know, the option is on your preferences page).

Equally, if bitcoin needs censorship to survive it deserves to die.

Thanks.  I decided to try using it to buy some btc.  I transferred £50 and it took 53 hours before it appeared in their system.  The btc transfer out was very fast.  I'm disappointed as bank transfers don't take days to arrive anywhere else.  I don't think I'll use uphold for buying btc again.

I'm subscribed to several bitcoin subreddits.  It's important to me that I receive an overall unbiased view and that's something I can't get from this sub alone.
But I would also like to say, Coinbase should never acquiesce to demands.  Just look at how well it worked for [Protonmail](  If you allow theymos to influence your decisions you legitimise the power he believes he has.

I agree but I'm another person who thinks the layout is a problem.  There's too much superfluous stuff e.g. lots of white space, announcements, signatures, avatars, bitcoin addresses, joined date, empty sub-forums etc.  At the moment It feels as if I need to scroll my mouse for a week before I get to the content.  Something like Discourse would be much more appealing.

I think she would be doing herself a disservice by only accepting bitcoin.  As her book is for an incredibly niche audience her best option would be to make her ebook widely available to capture as much of that audience as possible.  Amazon's kindle publishing seems like a better fit for her if she wants to make money.
