Thanks! Surprisingly, my blockchain wallet was never affected.

This is such an absolute shock. I will have to respond later. My head is swimming right now.
OK, I'm coherent again. I posted this to the silkroad subreddit too.
I don't feel it's best for anyone to speculate about the allegations, so I won't.
He was a physics major when I knew him (2002-2006) although we lost touch after college and he moved out of Dallas back to Austin. The kind of guy who'd walk around campus barefoot and shirtless wearing a camelbak in the middle of summer.
I met him at college orientation, and got to know him really well through a mutual friend, we'd work out daily at 6AM together. Ross was a total hippie and never wore deodorant. I never said anything but I HATED having him as a spotter because he smelled.
Seriously though, he is utterly brilliant. You know how people in college like to think they're being all intellectual and have "deep" conversations? Well, Ross was for real. He'd lose everyone in the conversation after a few minutes, he was just thinking through things at a level so profoundly different than the rest of us.
Great artist as well, he had an incredible notebook full of amazing sketches. Lots of his own art up on the walls too.
He taught me how to meditate, specifically a method I could use to get help get rid of headaches.
But honestly, most of the time I spent with him was just hanging out in the on-campus apartments, eating pizza and playing video games. Just like any other college student. That's why all this feels so unreal.
I actually just posted to his Facebook wall, but I don't expect he'll be able to see it.
Edited to add: He always kicked my ass at ping pong too.

Two factor authentication should really be done for ANY website that offers it.
I have it set up on Coinbase, Mt. Gox, my web hosting company, hell even Battle.net. There's no reason not to for the extra security it provides.

No shit, I went to college with this guy.  Absolutely unreal.

Is there any mirror for this? I went to college with a guy named Ross Ulbricht. He was brilliant as shit.
Oh, my god. It's him.

More out of respect for him than anything else.

No different than any other American should feel, I suppose.

Gonna pass on that... I barely feel comfortable posting what I did.
