No it's the opposite of that. You want the BTC today because it's going to double in value in two weeks.


First of all you probably can't convert all your money to BTC because there are not enough people wanting to sell (why sell something that's going to double in value next week?) Secondly you are going to have to have some dollars to pay for your rent, utilities etc.
The logical thing to do is to buy some BTC and hold them as investment (it will double in value every two weeks) and spend the rest of your USD on day to day expenses.
This is exactly what is happening now and why the value is going up so fast.

That's actually a loss there are transaction sites and the delay is going to cost you.


Exactly. You are going to hold on to the currency that appreciates and spend the currency that doesn't.


But it does matter. You lose if you spend the BTC.

No there is a huge difference. Let me explain.
Let's say you have $500USD and 10BTC.  They are both worth the same thing.
Say you want to buy a laptop and the vendor takes both currencies.
you are much better off spending your USD because in two weeks the BTC will be worth $1000.00 dollars and your USD will still be only worth 500 dollars.
You are better off holding on to your BTC, it is gaining value every day.

Sure but clearly not many people believe that. If that view was prevalent the price would not be going up.
BTW people could also decide it's too hard and expensive to get bitcoins and migrate to litecoins or ripple or whatever.


Which is exactly what is happening right now. It went from 30 dollars to almost 70 in three weeks.

Unfortunately the moderation system of reddit guarantees every subreddit will become a circle jerk.
If you go against the prevailing mentality you will be down voted, If you get down voted enough you will be rate limited and won't be able to participate in the conversation. That's when people usually either leave the subreddit or make another identity.
It's a shame really. It prevents dissenting voices from being heard.

So every wallet has to contain the whole blockchain right? You can't just have the recent transactions or something like that?

Does the light client keep the wallet on your PC or on the server?

Maybe he was the elites. Maybe there are bugs in bitcoins designed to keep track of who you are. Maybe it was designed by the NSA.
We can speculate all day long can't we?

If you have bitcoins why would you want to spend them. The value goes up every day by a significant percentage. It has doubled in three weeks FFS.

Weren't 12,000 bitcoins stolen recently?
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:40:42
You left out one thing. Everything you said about bitcoins applies to all digital currency. There is nothing special about a bitcoin wallet as opposed to a litecoin wallet. 
When people talk about the scarcity model of bitcoins they forget the competition. Anybody can fork bitcoin at any time and create a competing currency.

It doesn't inspire much confidence though does it?
Also you need to have some better instructions or something. I live in NZ and your site says I can buy bitcoins by depositing money into an account in NZ. What account? What bank? Where are the instructions?
Also there is no indication of how I can put in a buy order at a price. Say I want to buy at $50.00 USD. Can I do that? If so how?

He is also probably a billionaire by now.

From NZ? There are no NAB banks in NZ.

His point is why buy anything at all when holding on to the currency is more profitable.
It makes no sense to use the coins to buy anything when their value is doubling every week or two. 
This doubling causes more people to buy it which puts more demand on supply which pushes the price up.  It's a destructive feedback cycle as right now there is no incentive to use your coins for any reason other than speculation.
