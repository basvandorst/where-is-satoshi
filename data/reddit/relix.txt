But these restrictions only apply to exchange services. It doesn't apply to paying with bitcoin, does it? In fact, doesn't this confirm that bitcoin is a valid means of payment instead of a "resource" or something else, and isn't that in the best interest of bitcoin? All I'm seeing right now, from this specific court case, is that bitcoin trading services need to do some due diligence according to these rules, but it's not banned nor unfairly taxed?

Hey Otto,
I haven't been following the case, but according to what I'm reading, and what I can find here: 
Do you feel btc.ee is not a "provider of services of alternative means of payment" according to the definition?


Since it's definitely not a "currency exchange service" due to the restriction of "official currencies" as stated here:


So doesn't it make sense then that btc.ee should follow this law:






So do you disagree with the ruling that btc.ee falls under this definition (if that is indeed what the ruling was) or do you find it unfair what the law is saying (i.e. do you wish to change the law), or something else entirely?

Did you even read the OP question, the parent's answer, and my rebuttal? He asked how to get bitcoins, parent said it's because of fiat's problems, I said that's not the case. Getting them by doing a bank transfer is totally acceptable since it's not something you should be doing willy nilly. I didn't say anything about "bitcoin vs banktransfers", of course they're in a different ballpark. Jesus christ, learn reading comprehension why don't you.

We've got a cowboy here!
Because you can't predict the future, and for every time you think "oh, *this* is the bottom, I'll buy now!" 50% chance that it's going to keep falling. Even worse, sell on its down grade as early as possible? How do you know it's going to keep falling? 50% chance that it's going to skyrocket right after you sell.
That's how you make money? No, brother, that's how you lose your mortgage.

This is not about bitcoin vs fiat, this is about grand-grandparent saying it's problems with fiat being revokable that make it hard to get bitcoin, which is untrue because you can get them with banktransfers which are unrevokable

Ah I see. Yes there were no differences in pronunciation I don't think, only in spelling and it was to generalize things like "K" vs "C" (both pronounced as C like in cat). I was a wee little lad so I don't remember much anymore.
Anyway, while by law everyone of course is free to make spelling mistakes, everybody was pretty much obligated to follow the new rules or be looked at as stupid. When older people misuse K it is regarded as a spelling mistake.

A wire transfer is de facto unrevokable, at least in Europe, which is what we're talking about here. There was a recent case of fraud where a family bought a house, and the invoice that was sent them was intercepted and duplicated by scammers, but they changed the bank account number for the wire transfer. The family sent the money to the scam's bank account, and even though it was €30K and the bank account was under a different name than the one that was given during the wire transfer, the money went through unrevokably.
So yeah, unrevokable. Stop spreading FUD you know nothing about just to prop up bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need your lies to look good, it looks pretty nice without them already.

Stop spreading FUD about "fiat".
Cash is unrevokable. Wire transfers are unrevokable. It's CC's, cheques and paypal that are revokable/unreliable, and those aren't a property of licensed currency at all but an extra layer of abstraction on top of it.

That's true, but other articles in our news stated that the bank said they were not to blame, and that the people did lose their money and had no recourse - i.e. the transfers weren't recalled, and won't be. They were talks about setting up a fund for victims to scams.

When the green booklet was introduced it sure as hell felt like a managed way to force some improvements into the language.

This is definitely theft from a moral and a legal viewpoint. It's not because you have a shitty storage unit that anyone is free to come pick up your TV.
