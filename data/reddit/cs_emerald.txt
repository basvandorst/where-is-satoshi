I think the best argument you can make against Bitcoin Cash is that the 8MB blocks, while improving the network shortterm, will not scale well (miner centralization due to expensive nodes). You cant just keep increasing the block size hoping itll fix everything.
Also, everything Bitcoin Cash has going for it is that it's like Bitcoin, but faster and cheaper. It still gets outperformed by lots and lots of Alts, so it's not actually something that i could see winning out longterm.
So if you take those two things into account, together with the fact that there is this whole "Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin" narrative, it just seems like a scam, trying to get people who are frustrated with tx fees on board even though it actually doesn't offer any longterm, decentralized scaling options (like segwit or lightning network).

Its still really early man

Wasnt there something about bigger blocks harming decentralization because its a lot more expensive to run a full node once the blocks start filling up?
Id say that there is still some uncertainties for BCH, scaling wise. But for the short-medium term its perfect for transactions.

Try gdax! You need a coinbase account to use it, but its worth it because fees are really low.

Sooo everything that grows this quickly is immediately a bubble? Not trying to argue, i know nothing about finance/markets, just curious.
If something is truly revolutionary, could it not rise very quickly without necessarily being a bubble?

But a lot of Cryptos grow wayy faster im value! Are they all even crazier bubbles?

Im in a similiar position, but as a newcomer to crypto i feel like paying those nasty fees just so i can buy in a bit sooner would mean i dont have enough patience for this market anyways :P
