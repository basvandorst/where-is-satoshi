About so called gamers complaining about gpu. How many of you really bought the top end cards? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:22:52
ty i was googling since then and now i understand. Sadly one day bitcoin will have to do it, probably 1 company will own all the mining power in the world if it doesent allready meaning they do what miners do.
It is not decentralized by any degree. But i understand what u try to say.
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:35:31

asic proof . 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:21:50
nvm i just found out about bitcoin gold beeing the fork exactly because of this to not allow asic mining. hope one day it s  value will go up. I am not a shill, i m a simple ethereum miner and it s sad i cant mine some coins just because the huge chinese cartels can farm only, cuz an asic miner is minimum 5k on the market virtually removing any normla buyer from using it especially int heir home.
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:38:47
How u mean? Anyone can mine ethereum but 99% can't afford an asica miner
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:04:03
Bought tron got rekt
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:56:41
ethereum is in the top and is asic resistance.
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:13:34
So wich one is the real bitcoin plz stand up

@_date: 2018-01-20 15:21:07
if bitcoin is so innept that 99% of mining is centralized, why keep using bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:16:37

@_date: 2017-12-17 02:16:42
It's a platform for banks like an instant exchange and transfer crypto that is Beeing adopted by banks in Japan and so just now
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:08:52

@_date: 2017-12-28 08:55:38
Yes.cheaper dollar means less expensive us exports amongst others. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:13:53
So why is not dipping? ITS A TRAP
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:13:15
Or just use litecoin 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:11:15

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:56:03
U guys are completely wrong about USD. I live in Romania my countries currency always depreciates compared to us dollar so I get yearly more money to spend just by having my money in USD or Euro. With USD u can buy anywhere anything in the world. No other currency can do that. Also u Americans hate ur country so much stupidly that u are blind how lucky u are in so many ways.
Bitcoin is great but not even in in 20 years will be as useful as the USD. And that's good news for u Americans.
Something physical will always be more useful then digital I  day to day life. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:05:30
Fiat will always be useful. Deflation is more a storage of value. If u think fiat will collapse cuz of crypto u are deluded just like ppl who said books will disappear cuz digital media or movies but even more so. Fiat is extremely useful and without fiat our economies would collapse and lead to starvation. Wheneever a finite resource like gold is used as money it lead to the rise of a ruler aristocratic class and the poor starving. Today in western countries we basically eliminated starvation even homeless ppl can buy at least a bread daily wich is what we got for an entire family 20 years ago in communism.
Do not try to wage a war with fiat it is really stupid.

@_date: 2017-12-19 10:19:42

Giving 50% of ur income is not affordable by any measure as is here in europe.

Yes it is, all governments badly manage tax money because is no incentive not to. Whatever the government does a private company can do much better and with less costs. See tesla vs nasa 
Stop shilling your communist shit system. Never worked and humanity had enough poverty and hunger. Ty
Capitalism in 40 years got billions of ppl put of poverty. No other system in humanity did.  
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:38:18
Sweden and norway are NOT SOCIALIST COUNTRIES. furthermore norway fell 20 places at top wealthiest countries after they introduced their socialist agenda in the 80s. Also they have few million people only as inhabitants. 
Again, name 1 socialist country that is successful and where people risk their life to get to, as is with western countries. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:35:18

There is because CPU does 1 thing good = asic. GPU many things at once. Completely different things. Just as u cant use a cpu instead of a GPU u cant use gpu instead of cpu
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:02:56
Yeah... it crashed.
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:31:55
u can change the algorithm every few years, who cares. Bitmain and bcash shills dont want this, cuz they lose the power they have over all of us and coin mainpulation.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:14:16
There wont ever be. Asic resistant means is not worth making it look at x3 bitmain 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:11:50

Banks are responsible for the economical growth. Without banks I'd be borrowing from mafia type chars breaking your legs.

@_date: 2017-09-07 21:08:49
If everybody holds bitcoin that means no one gets anything. 0 use

Bitcoin is done. Litecoin cash is the future
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:17:24
Bought the dip at 19k. Nice advices on btc forums... crypto has 0 backing indeed. If the wind blows a bit by night we 'll all forget crypto ever was a thing. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:29:27
So these ppl invest in btc.. we re fucked
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:58:08

Lol naive kid. Ur bitcoin is bitmain centralized. U dont even have the power to mine for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:26:29
Nop. U can change protocol every few months and asics are garbage.

@_date: 2018-04-25 17:32:35
Make btc asic resistant only then can u claim it yo be decentrelized 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:04:00
That is crashing

BRING THE EXPERT!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:22:29
Its not shit and giggles cuz he can manipilate it and get real money 2000 or xtimes he bought it for in time feeding crumbles to newcomers. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:00:22
I forgot that not all coins are mind yet. Still someone can aquire majority and manipulate it as its happening now getting huge gains.
@_date: 2017-07-29 07:19:48
Butcoin loses 25% or gains it daily. Look at this year bitcoin is just traded as speculation now 99% of tome. If u lool at facebook stocks u get better value longterm then volatile cryptos. Its cool just dont think 99 perc of ppl will use bitcoin in the next 30 years.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:57:43
New btc is a way to control crypto so they succeeded. Ty segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:20:32
But if i would ve bought all when ig launched u are all just playing my game.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:19:06
But the more prices go up the more ppl sell and prices fall. I think most of bitcoin is allready owned by someone or is just a mattef of time. It s simple logic as with any limited currency. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:34:34
Ha? Arabs did not do anything in 1600. What are u talking about? Islam conquered most arabs in 700 and music, mathematics, science was forbidden. 
Muslim hordes attacked europe for 1000 years. 
Arabs had nothing to do with the enlightenment, muslims are still against separation of church and state,  that s why they are lead by their religious leaders in the state and have sharia as state law.
U just harm arabs by siding with islam and their countries being led by religious oppressors.

He was a ceo before investing in bitcoin..
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:28:07
Babylonians used mathematics way before arabs. Egyptians 30 000 years before arabs. 
Islam conquered arabs and made them stall and stop every innovation for 1300 years. All the innovations in the last 1500 years came from westerners.
Islam is cancer. Arabs should get free of it already and join us. Religion has no place in government. Separation of church and state is the only way for a modern society. 
Remember the dark ages at us, westerners. We got free of it thanks to separation of church and state.  Arabs never got it. Enlightenment.

The iranian shills are out in force. Fuck iran and every islamist country govern by religious freaks. Ass backwards idiots.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:03:20
No one is discounting anything, but to defend their government today means to encourage their people s enslavement by their religious zealots who held them back for 1000 years and are holding them back today.
All the stuff you wrote happend BEFORE ISLAM enslaved the arabs.
