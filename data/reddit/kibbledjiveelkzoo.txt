Another pondering . . . is this our Satoshi Nakamoto?:
"OK, my [censored] time. The experiment in this paper was not conducted under a grant. It was funded through a company I used to own. I could have used the money to go on a vacation, buy a better car and many other things. I used it for the purpose of my research.
In fact, I used to own two sports cars and a boat. I sold all of these in order to do some of these experiments. That was MY choice, I wanted the answers and I do not regret it one iota.
That stated, if you want to have me do more. Fund me. If not, don't [censored] about whether I have covered your pet project in my research. Remember this was MY research. I may be attached to a university, but this does not mean that I do not use my own funds when I choose to."

The heading title of the entire survey states: "Volume trends, mobile payments adoption, and Bitcoin are key themes"
Apparently there has been a: "notable uptick in bitcoin adoption".
Merchant acquirers &amp; independent sales organizations that were surveyed that have support for merchant acceptance of bitcoin:
* 2014 - Spring Survey: 0%
* 2014 - Autumn Survey: 2%
* 2015 - Spring Survey: 11%
. . . with an additional 12% of survey respondents stating that they now expect to enable bitcoin sometime in the next year.  That additional 12% number changes to 23% expecting to enable bitcoin when the time window is expanded to three years.

I quote from someone else's r/buttcoin post:
"Well the version of the story that I subscribe to is that this guy is not satoshi, he made a lot of money off smoke and mirrors security consulting or IT consulting and somehow became an early Bitcoin miner. He pointed a large GPU cluster at bitcoin and mined a bunch of coins, made some profits, and when the ASICs came he tried to pivot to whatever BS his web of companies is doing now."

From my perspective Samourai Wallet is kicking ass with development "lately".  There has been so much development of features that I find useful that I am a bit suspicious about why it seems to be chugging ahead so rapidly while other wallets and services seem to be nearly stagnant.  . . . makes me wonder if it's a well funded scam or some shit.  It's literally got me suspicious that something fishy Must be going on because it is so much better at making coding progress and releasing new versions with useful new features, than seemingly everything else out there.  O.o  Is this really just one guy working all day to get it done?  If so, what the Fuck is everyone else spending their time doing?!  
So, yeah . . . my inside voice is whispering that it must be all a Russian funded, backdoored scam or something . . . just because it's too good to be true . . .

Hmm . . . come to think of it, what I should say first is: thank you for adding full bech32 support to Samourai Wallet.  I find the functionality of it enhanced because of this upgrade and I already appreciate it's making my transactions less expensive by allowing custom fee rate entry and non-bech32 SegWit addresses that save data size.  Thank you again.

Um . . . something being described, definitionally means that it is not hypothetical?
I guess I am under the mistaken impression that one must formulate or . . . hehem . . . describe, their idea or guess in order for it to . . . well, pretty much exist at all . . .
Example: I have a hypothesis that a person does not understand that a hypothesis, when presented, is a description of an idea or a guess about how something is.
There is a description of a hypothesis. . . . or wait?  Is that not a hypothesis . . . I did just describe what the hypothesis is . . .   Oh no!  I don't have a hypothesis anymore because I stated what it is!  Fuck.

Could you explain that a little bit more, or even a good bit more?  One question I have is: what does "allows for 0-conf acceptance" mean?
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:19:38
What if I set it to: "-assumevalid=000batfart123ass"?  What if I set it to some bogus block hash value?  Will it just be as fast as possible because it is assuming everything is valid all the time?
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:50:56
I have noticed that if I wait for . . . twenty minutes or so, after turning on the computer, so that the Microsoft Resource Monitor shows most programs to have stopped accessing the hard drive, then it starts up and synchronizes "less slowly", as if all the programs going through some sort of startup process and then settling down, finishing whatever the fudge they do, clears the way for Bitcoin Core to thrash the drive with less delay.  I have set the -dbcach thingy to 2000, but it doesn't seem to get above 1.2 million bytes of RAM usage pretty much ever, not sure if that is even relevant.  After it shows that it is synched it seems to use the hard drive for a good while longer, growing in RAM usage to 1.0 or 1.2 million bytes eventually, like it is still building a database in RAM of some kind, accessing and reading the hard drive, the chain state.
I don't know, all I want is to be able to open the thing, form a few transactions without it hanging on every button click and fire off those transactions, all in less than say 300 seconds (5 minutes).  Currently I have taken to hibernating or sleeping the laptop with Bitcoin Core already open, just so I don't have the opening delay to deal with, just the very unresponsive "hangy" user interface while it is synching. (Oh yeah, there is pretty much no lag or hanging when everything is all synced up.)

Hey.  Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:49:46
I suppose I don't even know if "-assumevalid=1" is itself valid.  The assumevalid command thingy might only accept block hash values and "0" for all the flip I know . . .  Is "-assumevalid=1" a workable/understandable command to Bitcoin Core 0.14.0?  
@_date: 2019-03-19 11:24:34

Oh, okay.  Pffff.  Someone . . . an internet someone, gave me the impression that "-assumevalid=1" was setting it to "look back" only one block.  :/  Thank you for your clarifications.

Microsoft Windows.  Dell laptop.  Intel i5-2410M.  8,000,000 some bytes of random access memory.  Some stupid slow spinning hard disk drive.
It takes a good 10–15 minutes . . . the first time I start Bitcoin Core 0.14.0, if I have opened it before, closed it, and then open it again it takes a "mere" 45–60 seconds to open again, right after I close it.

I guess the idea of a Dash, Monero, Zcash, secret, private, confidential Bitcoin is so desireable and satisfying that it feels too good to be true to me.  I very much hope that all y'all computer programer/developer types out there in the world are able to implement this idea in code and that it becomes incorporated into the Bitcoin I am so passionate about.  Thank you and Godspeed.

"We expect to incur expenses for establishment of the next-generation mining center and research and development and manufacturing of hardware including the next-generation mining chip. We will not disclose the specific amount due to the non-disclosure agreement with our alliance partner, but it will be more than 10% of the consolidated noncurrent assets as of December 31, 2016 (¥3,489 million)."

I would think the process of securely generating a paper wallet is difficult enough, prone to error and exposing the private keys enough, that going about the process "from time to time" or "regularly" would be more of a hazard for one's value than a precaution of prudent statistical soundness.

Why are these auctions so prevalent on Bitcoin Reddits in the last two weeks or so?  Is their existence a sign of something important, is their presence just a form of advertising for Gemini?  I don't really understand why they are a source of discussion between people . . .

Where is it that you live?  I am assuming the sum of the angry people where you currently reside is larger in percentage than you believe that percent to be on the west coast?  If this is so, where is this anger-hole?  Please inform the world where not to go and not to live.  I, for one, would not like to live in an anger-hole of a city.
