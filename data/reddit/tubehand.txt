Just read all the comments here.
As a trader. Never really paid attention
 Have been reading more about this.
Seems to be thr majority consensus in here. That a fork is Innement, and just a matter of time.
I wonder if all the big venture capitalist in bitcoin even know about this? Or if they are just worried about day to day making as much bank as they can.

you are right.  rise lately has much more to do with then the ETF. massive capital flights out of FIAT into USD, the Sustenance agricultural  index, energy, and gold/ silver.  This has been happening for 2 years now.  Fiat is no longer a store of wealth, everyone understands it now.  the paradigm has shifted.  A mattress is more of a store of wealth then fiat

real comp is here. you have alt coins that use cpu gpu and pos all checking and balancing each other, with double the encryption, all while trying to launch the network into space using cube satellites, so no one can fuck with it. more complex then that, but bitcoin better hurry.  but block stream is funded by AXA... so that says it all. your only as decentralized as the the figures working on the progressive develpment of said technology, and we all no bitcoins dev team is not very decentralized and is funded by an interesting group of legacy finance individuals

Well surely some one has to plan for the future...
Lack of for sight kills 
Like part of my job is scaling the energy network and logistics of the world for expected growth 50 to 100 years from now.
If there weren't thousands of people working on this all over the globe. We would have major energy shortfalls, economic loss, famine, and civil unrest.
So I hope someone on the Dev team is thinking about the if. Lol waiting for it to happen is what shitty project managers do.

bitcoin is fucked man. just like the first computer. dusty old dinosaur fart.

They aren't big and evil. Never said that. They just have skin in the game to make sure things turn out their way.  They exist in a way different culture and paradigm then the new block chain industry.
  
Did you really post that link? lol.  When SWIM worked in organized*** crime  use to feed the homeless, single moms, and the poor.  The entire fucking village.  I guess that help out micro economic level helped canceled out the macro damage that happned.  
Open your eyes Companies aren't evil or nice.  They have self interest just like me and you do.
So when Exxon mobil does the same bullshit, it just cancels out all their aggressive energy business models doesn't it? 
So does coin base.  follow the money.  I am guessing you have never mutualized multi million dollar contracts from 3rd party funding?  Well, when you do... usually your partners expect a certain result. Bitcoin is gonna get fucked.  But its okay, their is ton of innovation comping quicker then ever.  Thanks to the free market

I disagree I travel all over the world n energy
Highly skled craftsmen and engineers make 30k to 60k a month depending on location and how bullish the the market is. AND hazard pay ect.
Any ways everyone is pretty well of for how dangerouse and miserable the lifestyle is. 7/12s all year.
Any ways. I to have been all over. And most people iv talked have never heard of bitcoin, and if hey have its some esoteric thing they imagine themselves not being capable of grasping.
2 differentives, 2 different expereinces.
Obviously it's still not ad esoteric like it was a few years ago. But to the majority.. it's esoteric.

Lol look at he definition of state. State does not mean united states.
We are called the United states for a reason.
US states were suppose to be sovereign states under a more central agent called the fed.
Much like european states are sovereign but respect the EU.
So a state is a goverment. The UK is a state
a nation or territory considered as an organized political community under one government.
And yes look what uncle Sam did to the middle east, eastern asia, banka republic states, South america. Uncle Sam stick his dick in anything that is against his will . the globalist of europe use uncle Sam to implement plans and attcks.
If uncle Sam doesn't like bitcoin chances are European globalist hate it as well

Hitler was a fabien socialist. Socialism thru gradual change.
Communsim is no different then socalism.
The only difference is communist implmentation is through quick brute force and not social engineering.
Hitler was a master social engineer, a perfect fabien socialist
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:23:28
It be stupid not to think that or if bitcoin was made by the state to social engineer people to be okay with a digital currency. AND then boom. The Fed releases a controlled digital currency and hard money dissapears, and everyone is okay because it's under the appearence it's just like bitcoin
Controlled opposition is powerful

The whole crypto market is bullshit and bullish lol.
You have blockchains/ companies/ teams/ with coins valued from .1 cent usd to 5$ or more, and none of the systems have been utlized or sold to anyone. Thete is no stream of income. At all.
Now traditonal cryptocurrencys like bit coin or even monero are tangible currencys.  Coins like fact that offer a product are very untraditional and are more products or assets then bit coin.  Yet they have a coin worth 3 usd, and have not sold the product to anyone, and no one is utilizing it.  MoSt penny stocks with multimillion dollar income and low income to debt ratios don't trade that high. The bull makret will climb for prob a decade. Then it will be nasty, worse then the dot com bust or the recent oil bust/ energy busy.

Bitcoin needs to adapt or it will die.
The world is dynamic.
If bitcoin fails to adapt another crypto currency will. Look at nexus. They are think 20 years down the line

lol shes not educated enough to make that call.
She is a judge lol.
judges cops, all of them are just as smart as the county clerks. Government is a joke, run away from it, decentralize all currency
