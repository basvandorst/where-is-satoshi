I'm as much of a fan of btc as anyone here, but at first glance this is awful:
Kickstarter has a history with a high number of fraudulent projects, but dealing with usd most transactions are refundable if shit hits the fan. With bitcoins once the money is gone the money is gone.
I can't imagine anyone using this given how easy it would be to be scammed.

It is a bit basic. Having some rules set like, 'if movement is beyond X% a day/week/month' then 'email notice'. Or 'if price hits X' then 'email notice'.

That is like saying USD $$ or EUR € or any other currency is a tax haven.
It isn't.
If you are a US citizen every time you sell on an exchanger (like selling bitcoins and buying $$ from those bitcoins) you have to pay taxes on that transaction. Most exchangers report that to the IRS.
However, changing hands with someone like you giving me bitcoins or me giving you bitcoins is like a money transfer, and isn't taxed if it is below $8,000 I believe.

I wouldn't use either personally, but they do work.
btc-e tends to have the lowest buy btc prices of any decent sized exchange so you can get the best deal buying if you transfer to btc-e and no need to verify as it is a russian exchanger.
From there you can take your bitcoins, put them in your wallet if you want, and then transfer them to another exchanger. It varries but I think bitfloor might have the highest bids on the market atm, so you can sell bitcoins there or elsewhere.
Personally, I wouldn't stick to mtgox unless you want to wait for verifications, have to deal with delays, and have it recorded by the IRS, so you have to pay taxes on it too. Regardless, mtgox does work at least.

It once was much easier to buy and sell bitcoins years ago as most sites supported paypal including mtgox, if I recall properly. However, paypal got a bit pissy and removed service to these exchanges. At the time bitcoins were labeled as a way to launder money. The only website to survive this mess is Virwox, because it doesn't advertise itself as a bitcoin exchanger and is supported by Second Life.
Back then exchangers didn't require a verification of personal information either.

I'd like to think most/all of the kinks are out of the system. All new things start this way. Bitcoin is now entering its early/mid growth spurt stage. Metaphorically, bitcoin is a teenager right now.
Right around the growth spurt range all of the kinks are removed or are nearly removed from the system. I doubt you'll hear about hacking exchangers in the future, just like you don't expect to hear about hacking banks. Sure, it is possible, but very hard to do.
As far as keeping bitcoins on your computer at home instead of an exchange where it can possibly get hacked there are a couple of security rules:
1a) Never type in your password. If you've got a keylogger on your system that is how they will steal your bitcoins. Instead copy and paste your password in from another location.
1b) Keep your password encrypted in a trucrypt file, or the like, with a separate password you do type in (or hopefully a random file as your password). How most people do it is they have a sort of 'one password to rule them all' where that password is exclusively only used to decrypt their password file and in the password file it contains all or most of the passwords on all of their other sites. This is nice if you want to use a different password on every website so you are more secure everywhere, and you will never forget your password.
2) Encrypt your wallet! (This goes back to 1a: Not typing in your password.)
3) Use some sort of cloud storage like dropbox, or the like. Cloud storage services are fantastic and free. You can move any files you want into it so, for example, you can put your my documents in there and if your computer crashes you will always have a backup of those files, and usually multiple revisions of those files as you worked on them. (However, if you're paranoid about your private information being leaked, you may not want to put personal information in the cloud.) Another good use is you can put a file there then link it to everyone you know online through email or whatever like a better attachment service. Another use is if you have multiple computers you can auto sync up all your files between them which is really cool. And finally: You can upload encrypted files to them, like your wallet.dat so if your computer ever crashes you'll always have a backup.
Anything that is potentially insecure can be secure. You just have to identify how it could be insecure (think like the hacker) and then put in counter measures. For me I trucrypt my cloud share and then set it up where I have to type in the password on my computer and decrypt it during bootup, and from there all of my personal stuff is mounted on my computer save and sound, so if my computer ever crashes I've got it covered, and it is hypothetically uncrackable even for quantum computers.
Also, good password advice is not a password like th1$ (this) but instead like this: allTheGrownupsWent0utToPlay$  ... basically a sentence that is easy to memorize and leaves a super long password. This way even if your information was leaked like at an exchanger it would take forever for it to be decrypted because the password is so long.
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:35:52
That you for the genuine concern, but it is a bit silly. For example:








It isn't Java. It is clicking yes when the window pops up asking you if you want to run such en such on your browser, and even then users outside of Windows are not affected by these Java exploits.
If you truly want to be cautious: encrypt your password protected wallet.dat using truecrypt, upload it to the cloud, and remove your wallet.dat on your computer. This way your coins are safe even if your computer crashes, and are encrypted using AES.
If you trade bitcoins often, then you'll want to run a virtual machine of another OS on top of Windows and have your bitcoin wallet in there decrypted from the cloud. Also, make sure the virtual machine isn't running Windows, doesn't have much of anything installed beyond the basics that come with the OS, and don't type in passwords! Instead have an encrypted file with your passwords in it. Then copy and paste your passwords into the exchanger websites and whatever else in the virtual machine. Bonus points if you disable copy paste functionality between OSes. This way if your base OS running Windows has a keylogger or another type of virus, it will not be able to get to your passwords or your wallet.

What filesystem?
Most filesystems today have some sort of journaling support. This means there should be tools in the operating system to scan the hard drive and automatically repair bad blocks.
NOTE: This will most likely only work if wallet.dat is not moved. For example, you backup wallet.dat THEN wallet.dat gets corrupted. You copy the backup wallet.dat to the proper bitcoin-qt path and see that wallet.dat is in fact corrupted. This means that the copy of wallet.dat most likely can not be fixed, but the backup wallet.dat that has not been moved or copied might be able to be fixed.
If you saved your wallet on a thumb drive which is most likely fat32, there is no journaling. sorry :/
I have another idea too, but it is complicated. Let me know how scanning your hard drive for corruption goes first and I'll throw some other ideas out there.

Timing the bottom is sooo much easier than timing the top.
First rule: Don't aim to get the bottom or the top perfectly. If you could have made 50% more, that is a fantastic trade knowing it wasn't perfect, because making money is better than losing money.
Timing the top is hard because you've got a week to time the top. Timing the bottom is easy because you've got 3-6 months to buy at the bottom.
I bought at $5 and sold at around $100. I could have doubled my income selling at $200, but I'm grateful I walked out of this without a loss.
At the time if I timed it right I could have bought at $1 and sold at $250. Holy shit would I have been rich, but realistically it would be nearly impossible.
It isn't about greed.

At least btc-e allows a wire transfer out, and lower buy prices than other exchangers. Also, taxes are when btc is sold for usd, not bought, so you can verify an mtgox, transfer to btc-e get around 5-10% for it due to the exchange difference and then when done wire it to your bank for 1.5%. btc-e is pretty nice in that regard, even if it isn't for instant gratification.

One day before the crash there was tons of people saying, "Bitcoins will __never__ go down." and 2 weeks before the crash people were saying things like, __vertical__, and __terminal velocity__.

1 in a million:
Make sure you do not lose your backup wallet.dat file.
Make a backup of your backup wallet.dat file. (copy the file)
Cut off the end of the wallet.dat file, so only the first 80% exists. Basically, split the file in two.
Try putting in the first half wallet.dat file you've made from your backup.
If you're lucky it will get to the point of having your 18 btc and then not having bitcoin-qt freak out on you.
If this doesn't work, then you'd probably have to go through the source code of bitcoin-qt and find out how it serializes data/reads data/writes data, and then write a program to get at the data, find the good data, find the bad data, split the two, and then write back.

No, I mean a decentralized exchange overall. It would make a lot of these exchangers pointless for trading. Their only use would be moving money in and out of bank accounts outside of the bitcoin p2p trading environment, like wire transfers. (Dwolla would still have a use but mtgox would not.)
For usd and other currencies mirror how btc works already with improvements: Have a p2p verification system just like bitcoins already are but for other currencies as well, so the bitcoin wallet apps can be upgraded to exchange money through a p2p system.
Have that p2p system keep track of market bids and asks decentralized. Anyone could write a client just like there are multiple bitcoin wallets already.
There is a couple of tricks, but it wouldn't be hard. The most centralized bit would be the the software that runs on users computer, and a trusted verification by a backed verification engine/server(s) for moving money ultimately in and out of the market (like wire transfers). Once usd first hits the market from a bank (dwolla) it has to tied to a verification crypto code, and when it leaves the market that code will never be used again, but that way multiple currencies can be verified just like btc is, and can be traded in a p2p environment.
The verification servers are ran by a central authority, but they do not touch the currency, trade it, move it, or anything beyond creating new encryption codes for usd, eur, yen, ... basically converting paper money into digital encrypted money.

Depends what you consider bottoming out. There are two ways to look at it:
1) Lowest price in that time frame. I may only be this price for a minute and then the price might double in a week... who knows.
2) When the dust has settled and btc becomes flat. Price doesn't go up or down much. It is kind of like a valley more than a crater.
I consider 'bottoming out' as  as it is the constant lowest price, not just the lowest price for a minute or an hour. It is when the price stabilizes enough to buy safely without it dropping down more in the future.
It is also usually the long term trader's best time to buy.

There may be something you've overlooked: btc may be able to transfer between exchanges, but usd can't always be transferred between the exchanges.
What would happen is you'd slowly build up usd in different exchanges above the rate you'd charge in commission to use your service.

It sounds like a caching issue and a delay in the password change.
Have you tried using a browser that hasn't touched btc-e before and logging in?
A couple of days ago I logged in fine but it showed in the top right I was logged out as if I hadn't logged in properly and in the center of the page gave an authorization error. It turned out when I manually refreshed the page the problem was fixed, but for some sort of reason clicking on links didn't help, only a manual refresh did.

Like all markets the limits are based on volume for that exchanger at that time, and how large moves will alter the market price significantly.
My first time buying on btc-e which has a lower volume than mtgox moved it 3 points at a time when the price was around 1 dollar a bitcoin. 3 points then was a very large move. (Think moving 100 to 300 right now.) I then quickly learned to split the amount I'm buying/selling up into pieces and let it execute in roughly 12 hours as to not move the market.
$10,000 USD at mtgox today you'd want to at very least buy/sell at a set price (limit order), not as a [market order]( or you will move the market. However, as far as $10k goes you could sell it within the hour pretty easily without any problem.

So basically it would be just a standardized protocol all banks that convert currency into ecurrency would have to follow, like a 0% transfer between banks when converting ecurrency to currency and a guaranteed return to clients.
If any banks break this protocol they can be disbarred from being allowed to use this service and the remaining banks foot the bill so people aren't taken advantage of.
Nothing centralized. I deposit money through BankA into the market and you deposit into BankB, and while the money is in the market the banks don't have any control. They only make money when currency is transferred in and out of the market, but inside the market it would be feeless, and p2p.
It would be similar to how forex trading is currently done between usd/eur. My exchange might interact with your exchange, but they share the same market. In this system I'm proposing it would be an upgrade from that where neither exchanges interact with each other when trading is happening, only money moving in and out of the exchange.

Eh, your chart reading skills aren't great. Sorry, but I'd rather be honest than than beat around the bush.
Usually when volume slowly goes down hour by hour (or day by day) so that volume looks like a right triangle, that signifies half of a pattern. (Not a specific pattern.) This obviously isn't a guarantee, but most patterns are easier to identify when looking at how volume is changing.
This is why the price is most likely not going to drop down much more than 100, if any at all, and instead is going to continue rocketing back up:

imho, yes wait till they go down to $50 within the next couple of months, if it turns out to be a bear (downward) market after a couple of weeks.
If after 3 weeks the price has gone up, who knows. You'll probably just want to buy.
Buying is not about getting the best price. You have months to sort it out when to buy.
In comparison to selling selling, the top happens for a week and then is gone. It is much harder to sell than it is to buy when long term investing.
A good bitcoin hold length (single trade) would be 6-12 months. If you try to day trade or swing trade you're pretty much guaranteed to lose the money. Instead, once you buy put a 3-6 month timer (notice on a calendar or something) to remind you to check. Once you've bought, forget you've bought. Stop checking the price and don't touch it.
When selling it isn't about being greedy. If you sell at $200 and it ends up going up to $500 in the end a month later, you did good. Don't try to get the top, and don't try to get the bottom. Just try to get something; don't be greedy.
Good luck. \^_\^

It is either that or your ID gets validated so if you do scam the exchange you can't do business with them again.
Regardless, even then, exchanges like mtgox do not allow direct credit card deposits for the same reason.
Personally, I think the solution to this problem is for btc-e to accept CCs but then put a hold on them until a chargeback isn't possible. It would be annoying for some people but could potentially end as a win-win.

Before the 'cool down' started I was paying attention to trades for the last 24 hours and noticed something very interesting:
MtGox was lagging (time delay) in ratio to how fast the market was going down, not in ratio to volume. If the price went up 5 points there would be no delay, but if it went down 5 points there might be around a 20 second delay.
So either MtGox is trying to keep the prices inflated, or the ddos is real and in ratio to what the market is doing as someone else has ulterior motives.
I did a little digging and found this: 
To get this to happen MtGox/Coinlab/Silicon Valley Bank/GroupX had to buy enough bitcoins to get enough money to float the project. When the price crashes down they lose their funding. MtGox most likely has to have the price of bitcoins high right now.
MtGox has a motive to inflate with the market atm.

I'm not a lawyer or a tax accountant, but if
1) It is just you buying and selling btc while you work and is not tied to the internet café, then there shouldn't be a legal repercussion.
2) If it is the internet café doing it, then you'll want to get a ledger and write down everyone's ID information when they trade with you by looking at their ID and writing down their name, age, sex, ... That way if legal trouble hits, you'll have a get out of jail free card. Please remember the information is legally private without a warrant or a subpoena.
If it is just you, there are sites like [localbitcoins]( where you can setup an user account there and offer to buy and sell btc. Ironically the website's example is if someone works at an internet cafe they could exchange btc while they work.

Investing is like playing a chess game, but your opponent is everyone else investing, including me.
Because it is like a chess game, new players lose 8/10 to 9/10 times. The ones that do not lose often have beginners luck, think they've got it figured out, and often lose just as much or more than everyone else.
If you followed what I said above that means usually 10 out of 10 new investors lose money. Very rarely does one make money, and continue making money and never lose. Usually one has to lose, figure out how it works, and then they start making money.
Because people lose money so well, you could take 10+ people, give them money to invest, and tell them to invest your money as a 9-5 job. What you don't tell them is they're not investing your money, they just think they are. Instead it is logging it into the system and the system invests the inverse. When doing so 9 out of 10 people will lose money for at least the first month.
The only reason this doesn't work in reality (using others to make free money like that) is they start to figure things out and roughly 50% will be gains and 50% losses after a month to three months, so new people would have to be constantly rotated in, which is unrealistic.

Don't tie yourself to your family. Go out on your own and do your own thing, hopefully in another city. Your family can be poor, but that doesn't mean you're poor.
Don't give your family money when you get a decent job.
Live like you're poor and save up every penny even if you're making 100k a year.
Invest your money passively, not actively.
Putting in $10,000 into bitcoins 2 years ago would give you a million if you sold at $100. If you sold at $200 you'd have 2 million. This is just in 2 years of saving money and not touching it, and knowing what you're doing.

My long term investing strategy:
I put money into the market (mtgox, or similar) and move it to btc-e.
I put in a buy order at btc-e and then move the bitcoins to my wallet the next day.
Later (3-6 months or so) I move the bitcoins from my wallet to bitfloor.
I put in an order to sell when the price hits X amount. (This could take months, even years.)
I come back and transfer the usd to my bank account.
*NOTE: I've used btc-e for years now, and enjoy their service more than any other exchanger. However, they almost have no customer support, so try to double check that you've copied the entire btc address when transferring money. If you miss a digit your money is lost. Outside of that, their service is fantastic.

  Why not aim to be a more decentralized exchange?
From the user end I'd love to see a model like how [Interactive Brokers]( works but instead of forex usd/eur, usd/btc.
They have a website for account management and tech support, but there is no trading on their website. They have software written in Java that is ran on the user's computer instead of the web page. This way there is little to no load on the website. Also, they have a fantastic API.
If you did it this way:
1) It would be more professional. It wouldn't just be a bitcoin exchanger, but the mentality would be closer to an actual broker.
2) If the software is running on the user's computer it can be decentralized the same way bitcoins are decentralized. This would carry on the bitcoin spirit.
3) It would be much cheaper. The server load would be minimal on your end as user's computers would be doing the heavy lifting and most of the data transfer. It would also be extremely cheap to maintain.
4) DDOS and flood immune. 
I highly recommend considering something more revolutionary instead of just reinventing the wheel again. Until you consider something a bit more revolutionary, I don't see the benefit.

A long term strategy still requires selling.
To successful execute a long term strategy you buy at a certain price and at the same time you think, "I'm going to sell it at X much." not "The market will go to this." but what you would be happy getting. Then it is as simple as putting in an order to sell when the price hits that amount.
Come back 6 months or years later and collect your money. It is as simple as that.

Western union transfer (up to $999 and they don't ask for an ID in most states) to wm-center.com if you don't want to send personal information.
You'll pay between 10-20% for the luxury, but it is pretty quick, usually within 24 hours, and if you go to an exchanger like btc-e the buy price is often around 8-10% lower than other exchangers, so the initial fee is minimized.

Corrections are healthy. They are what ensure a stock (or in this case btc) to continue moving in the same direction. It is when there is a lack of corrections that problems happen.
Corrections are happening right now. It is kind of like a diagonal up and right pattern then a right, often right and slightly down pattern.
A correction is less than the overall move of the direction of stock. It is kind of like a two steps forward, one step backward, two steps forward, kind of thing.
The corrections are flat right now meaning that btc is on fire and moving in a strong upward direction. It also means that if it doesn't slow down soon another bubble will in fact pop. However, it is too soon to say. Even if there was such a bubble to pop in 3 weeks from now, it is up to then to determine when it is going to happen. Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if it pops at around 200, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it skyrockets to 300+ and then pops. It really depends.

101 chart reading:
See the graph on the bottom? On the top right of that graph there is a +/-. Click the minus a handful of times, roughly so the lowest is 80 and the highest is ≈178.
That graph shows how many people are willing to buy at X price, X being between 80 and 180 in this example. If you hover your mouse over it, it will show information like 89k btc needs to be sold to hit 80 or 46k needs to be bought to hit to get to 170.
This graph shows how many people are trying to buy and how many people are trying to sell. In short, it shows how much resistance is needed to move the market in either direction.
An important note is when people buy they plan to buy which leaves the left (green) side of the graph to almost always be bigger. This means that the green can be larger, but a crash could still happen if there are panic sells.
Regardless, you can see the range (up and down) in which the market can go in the future and what the outliers are.
This information will help you decide when to buy, however it can be misleading. It will not help you decide when to sell. If anything, using this graph alone will cause you to hold at times when you should probably sell. Consider this a warning. Different tools are good at different things.
If you have any questions feel free to ask.
btw, my bias: I bought at 104 this last week. However, I have no idea where the market is going to go and tomorrow I could sell, or I could hold for a year. I don't know. What I do know is there is so much resistance right now that even if btc went down it wouldn't go probably more than 105 as the low range, before major resistance kicks in.

I don't know if it is the cheapest, but it is easy: btc-e
Sell bitcoins there to USD (if USD is your currency of choice), then click withdrawl and you can convert it to another bitcoin exchanger for a 0% fee (usually) or you can wire it for a 1.5% fee. There are also roughly 30 other ways to move the money around, but most of them have around a 3% fee, like I think you can convert it to different types of credit cards and what not.
Also, btc-e is a russian exchanger so no taxes for the most part. (Try to keep your wire transfers under 3k a piece or it will look like money laundering, or pay the 13.5% or whatever the tax is to the IRS.)
