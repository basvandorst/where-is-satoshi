No, not "the rich," but investors who actually know what they're getting themselves into. 
...though granted, given this is the first offering of its kind and WS traders don't understand the blockchain, "accredited investors" is sort of a practically meaningless requirement...

When will we be hearing more details about this?

Can you provide specific information about the bond itself? Or provide a link to it? I'm incredibly curious about how this will work practically speaking.

Judd, can you post a link to the press release once it's available? I've not found it anywhere yet.

Even though the tokens are $1?

Well connected big shots have been joining the boards of deep pocketed start ups for a while now; think itBit, Coinbase, BitPay, Ripple. That goes a lot toward aiding legitimacy and knocking down barriers, but that doesn't say anything about present market traction. It just means things like bitcoin will be allowed to stick around. Whether people use it or make money with it is a separate thing. The major motivation for the big shots joining is the paycheck, opportunity to join something really new and interesting, and no real risk to their careers at this stage.

He was involved with 21 as an investor at A16Z before he left to become CEO. So there's definitely a feedback loop issue there. That of course doesn't mean the investment would be bad, but it does mean there's a real risk of becoming tone deaf. It's damn easy to pick apart another's strategy and simultaneously be bereft of common sense with your own.

You can also add Monetago &amp; DCG to the "complying" crowd. Each just submitted their application late last week.

I believe the answer is "no" since the P2P exchanges are effectively just matching engines that assist w/ payment processing but don't actually touch BTC or USD in the process. I think the "peers" themselves would, however, need to comply, since they're the ones actually performing the exchange services. You know what though, I do wonder how companies like Western Union will deal. I don't believe companies like Local Bitcoins or Coinffeine are required to do KYC, which means even if Western Union knows it's services are being used to buy/sell bitcoin via unlicensed dealers, there's nothing it can do. Maybe that's actually a good thing for them. Anyway, I know everybody knows there are tons of holes in the bitlicense; P2P activity certainly seems unanticipated...or at least not addressed directly.

Good point. I suppose they'd just stop offering it to counterparties in NY (if they're actually concerned).
