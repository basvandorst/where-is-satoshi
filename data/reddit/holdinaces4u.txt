Can you recommend any who are crypto currency friendly, we need to find a merchant processor ASAP
@_date: 2019-12-17 22:07:05
because you really can pay with crypto.

I don't know the exact percentage maybe 2-4% of the population uses bitcoin. As a business man, I need to accommodate my clients and offer as many payment methods as possible. I just wanted to alert the bitcoin community on how they are attacking bitcoin now.

"Dr_reality_again", your handle says it all. The reality is , until the world adopts bitcoin, we as merchants must accept traditional payment methods.

Middleman is referring to platforms such as airbnb and homeaway who charge 30%+ in commission.  We on the other hand act as a portal and only charge gateway fees of 2%. All payments bypass us and go directly to Property Host. Stripe facilitates this by offering Stripe Connect and Paypal facilitates as well with Portal Payments. Chainpay is our cryptocurrency merchant processor and they also offer this feature as crypto payments go directly to property hosts wallet when a client pays for his vacation rental with crypto.

That may be true as well.

uhm, yea wrong conclusion. The logo is not a clone either, look carefully.

This is an attack, how can you define it otherwise.
Visa and Mastercdard state: "If you (stripe or any other merchant processor) dare to enable merchants who accept bitcoin as payments on their website then we (visa and mastercard) will shut you down." 
How is this not an attack. They should simply allow merchants and merchant services providers to allow any other form of payments they wish.

Yea sure buddy, maybe you can stick to the point of this thread.
