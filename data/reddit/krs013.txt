I, for one, think this is a good thing because it could be seen as a sign that Bitcoin could be a viable investment for bigger companies (the wolves will come quickly) and that would drive up its value a lot in the short term. See [this article]( as an example.
Though at the same time, if you look at the last two paragraphs, this might be good in the long term, bad in the short term. I am new to this as well.
