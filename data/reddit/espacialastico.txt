The damage that tether did to bitcoin will never be repaired
@_date: 2018-08-13 14:10:18
Because those 26 dollars will be 10 next week
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:20:55
All in
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:45:09
Theymos at work
@_date: 2018-08-11 14:07:26
We got 4 months til this excuse stop making sense
Finally.. I was getting tired of it
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:09:02
as opposed to what? ledger nano and all that closed source garbage?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:26:35
Why america? What happened now?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:24:43
Eat my longs, man
@_date: 2018-05-25 04:53:23
It can be both
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:22:18
Hope you realize that if manipulation ends, btc goes straight to 2k
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:34:27
These posts make me think we haven't  hit the bottom yet... not at all
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:50:49
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:50:09
Yeah there's no open source hardware wallet publicly available but I guess you can make your own
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:02:27
Finex started printing tether like crazy when btc was 2k
They probably tested the waters a bit before that, tho
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:25:44
BCore also gets pumped and dumped like a shitcoin tho
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:20:12
Adoption coming soon
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:12:28
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:44:27
A out of people want to buy btc because of its volatility
@_date: 2018-05-24 16:36:10
Investors with superpowers
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:26:20
Crypto is a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:24:57
Since 2009
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:07:18
So you think it's manipulated only when it goes down? You think the run from $800 to $19800 was organic?
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:23:13


He is and he was pretty pissed at moonboys who discovered btc last year spamming his twitter mocking him and shit
No one can see the future but it's easy to see btc is a Ponzi scheme, that's why no one truly believed in it to justify holding after 2x'd or 3x'd your money
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:03:33


That's like.. a fraction of all the tether they printed
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:52:48
True. Some laggards are still holding. As soon as they all lose hope and sell, the next big bullrun will begin (probably a bit after the next halvening) and i think 3.5k is that price although it could go lower than that, idk.
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:15:33
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:33:14
It's too late now
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:48:26
My bad, I read 2017 for whatever reason 
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:32:08
Weird.. so, price related threads are only allowed when it goes up?
That's very wack
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:20:06
Willybot took us to 1K
Tether took us to 20k
Whos gonna pump us next time?
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:53:05
I'm relaxed :)
@_date: 2018-07-13 15:26:57


No, no one will start buying bitcoin because someone spams about it on twitter
It's just annoying and if anything makes me want to avoid it
