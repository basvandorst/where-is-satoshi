I hope they accept Goxbtc.

I also don't like how the app ask me if I would like to add an address to my book before I complete a payment. Can't it ask me after?

I think the Moronic Monday post belong here.  Let's not make this sub worse so another sub can possibly gain traction.

You're not even on house arrest and you're bitching and whining.
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:03:50
At least they change it up.

I know that much. I'm  wondering if Satoshi used some exponential growth or decay formula to find find those nice numbers.
@_date: 2014-11-27 23:17:18
Yeah, that seems like a good solution but It seems like the trolls would just keep making new accounts.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:58:26
How do communities successfully handle trolls? They seem especially fiery in this sub.

Bitcoin and government don't mix.

@_date: 2014-08-20 07:20:45
Let us know if you need funding for that.

Just wait until your employer pays you more bitcoin.

I´m pretty sure the majority of bitcoiners are aware of this subreddit. Prove me wrong.
@_date: 2014-08-21 00:02:39
Keep up the good work and good luck.

I think you can do this on fiverr but it's not going to pay that well.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:26:50
where are they?

It makes literal sense, smarty pants.

Happy bday bro!

14 bitcoins each.

How bazaar 
@_date: 2014-08-02 13:32:06
Awesome! Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-08 06:51:07
Not for long.

Great points. CIMS needs to do this in front of a green screen and put a bitcoin logo behind him... and change the volotility arguement because apparently that pisses people off. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:03:08
baby steps

Hey, you know what?: We should make a place like this. I have the domain Coinclasses.com. pm me if you're interested in this project.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:01:58
Wouldn't a candidate like this help us slow this "cultural inertia" or is it just inevitable that everything will decentralize and we should just sit around waiting for more technology and hope the governments come around without too much trouble despite the fact that we have done nothing to change the government. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:23:03
Needs some dramatic music IMO
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:08:46
How many full nodes are connected right now?

What bitcoin does now more than anything is inspire. Innovation and ideas are sprouting up all around it and this brave, talented community is its most valuable asset.
Because we're still in the early stages of this technology, I think the more interesting question that a lot of us are asking is "what can bitcoin do?". Some of us think it can change the world.

If I control the private keys do I still run the risk of uncoloring my coins somehow?

But then you're like someone who is relying on their parents to bail them out of any tough situation. You can't always depend on them and you can't always rely on banks as history has shown. Don't be afraid of a little responsibility.
