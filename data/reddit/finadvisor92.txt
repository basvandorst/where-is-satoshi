You do realize hes talking about the stock market and not bitcoin, right?

Yeah - just because a single stock enters a "bear" period does not mean it will rebound lmao.

You really aren't understanding. You guys are acting like the bear/bull cycle can be attributed to a single stock, which it doesn't lmao. When one stock enters a "bear" phase, there is no real reason to assume that one single stock will rebound.

The fact that y’all think bull/bear market trends apply to bitcoin is astounding. Bull/bear market trends don’t even necessarily apply to individual stocks. Notice it’s called a bear “market”, meaning it encompasses a trend that the entire market is following. Not one stock. Bitcoin isn’t even a stock. Holy mental gymnastics.

Inside Job is literally about the crisis. No shit they were lending sub prime mortgages... because it was based on what was happening before the market crash.

If people treat it as they should and pop in like 3% or less of their portfolio, then have at it. I have trouble with people who dump half their money into it. Also - bitcoin is like a single stock in the fact that anything can happen to it at any time.

Yes - compared to its initial price. Think about this though, General Electric IPO'd at 60 cents/share, hit $57-58/share at its peak. Now it is $7. Do people think GE has done well? No, General Electric is pretty widely known as being a failing company at this point.
