it's a bit nitpicky, I know... but he said bitcoin is encrypted. 
None of bitcoin is encrypted. Oh yes, there's lots of hashing going on, but no encryption. ...It's all transparent.

From the bitcoin wiki:
"Most Bitcoin outputs encumber the newly transferred coins with a single ECDSA private key. The actual record saved with inputs and outputs isn't necessarily a key, but a script. Bitcoin uses an interpreted scripting system to determine whether an output's criteria have been satisfied, with which more complex operations are possible, such as outputs that require two ECDSA signatures, or two-of-three-signature schemes. An output that references a single Bitcoin address is a typical output; an output actually contains this information in the form of a script that requires a single ECDSA signature (see OP_CHECKSIG). The output script specifies what must be provided to unlock the funds later, and when the time comes in the future to spend the transaction in another input, that input must provide all of the thing(s) that satisfy the requirements defined by the original output script."
This means that payment to Party B can be done such that to spend that payment requires another, third party, signature... 
It seems to me that in any case, Party A will have lost those funds... but neither will Party B be able to spend those funds without the approval from Party C.
