The network continues to grow stronger...in China, all thanks to ASICs. Meanwhile, Bitcoin becomes increasingly centralized as it "grows stronger."

You're right. Mining pools are owned by democratic committees voted in by a global, decentralized constituency with the interests of the entire world at heart.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:08:43
Bitcoin has not been able to surmount its scalability issues, so The Store of Value narrative has become the prominent one.
@_date: 2019-01-30 05:22:39
Whoever owns the mining pool ultimately decides what gets mined and how it's mined. It is the ultimate central point of failure.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:41:22
If you think that Xi Jinping doesn't have the power to order around 3 mining pool operators, you are delusional.

China is the world's factory. They don't just manufacture cheap plastic toys. They manufacture pretty much everything, including and especially chips and other high tech components.
Sure, they world will buy them from China, but not before China times shipments such that other countries and importers are always behind in the ASIC race. That is not mere speculation--it's something that's been happening since the production of the very first ASICs.
Also, the fact that Bitmain--a Chinese company--manufactures most of these ASICs means that they can program backdoors into their equipment or be ordered to by the Chinese gov't if it serves the interests of Chinese national security.
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:35:31
even the leader of a democratic country (or any intelligence agency) has the power to order 3 people to change mining pool operations
@_date: 2019-01-30 03:09:00
Even if other countries have better ASIC designs and can catch up, they won't be able to manufacture them on the scale that China is able to for the reasons I mentioned in my post. No other country has the combination of manufacturing expertise, brainpower, capital, government impetus, efficiency, labor supply, natural resources, and supply chain networks that China has, by a huge margin. If the Chinese government thinks mining is a valuable industry, it WILL put its enormous weight behind it and make it a national priority. This narrative that hashrate will eventually only depend on access to cheapest electricity is just that--a narrative that has not played itself out in any form.

Tell that to the participants of Roger Ver's [Bitcoin.com]( mining pool, who thought they were mining BTC but unbeknownst to them were mining BCH during the BCH vs. BSV hash war.
If you actually read that paper, you'll see that there are far more creative and subtle ways that pool operators can manage pool operations to censor or de-prioritize transactions. You are absolutely fooling yourself if you think that mining pools represent no centralization.
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:58:40
China is controlled by one dictator/autocrat. If he decides that damaging bitcoin is in his best interest, the Chinese mining pools will have no choice even if it ruins them financially.

You honestly believe that all CPU development is going to hit a complete dead end and there will be no progress at all? What happened when clock speeds hit a dead end in the 2000s? Did CPUs complete stagnate? No, Intel just came up with new multi-core, lower energy, lower-frequency architectures. Now other companies like Samsung, Apple, Qualcomm, etc. are inventing new CPU architectures based on new designs and manufacturing processes that are giving traditional Intel processors a run for their money. The same can be said about RAM, GPU and HDD/SSD development--every time engineers hit a new wall they invent new techniques to get around it.
All of these are developments are going to spill over to the ASIC space. ASICs aren't completely isolated from the rest of the industry. And if Bitmain doesn't push boundaries, another chinese asic manufacturer will.

So you should modify your strategy to: sell (high or low), when the fundamentals get bad.
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:32:59
That's never going to happen. ASICs will never just stop changing just like chip/cpu development is never going to just to stop progressing. As long as mining bitcoin is viable, there will always be a strong financial incentive to find an edge over competing miners or asic manufacturers.

I'm not sure the community would be able to do anything about it save for a contentious hard fork

Bcash happened, and even though Bitcoin survived and came out on top, it really hurt trust in Bitcoin (same goes for Bcash and BSV)

Hadn't they given Bitcoin a C- rating like 6 months ago? These clowns wildly change their ratings all the time, they clearly do not know what they are doing.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:10:50
It's not Bitmain, it's China. China has a huge chip manufacturing advantage and access to cheap materials and labor supply that no other country can match. Don't expect ASIC dominance in China to dwindle any time soon. If Bitmain goes down, another Chinese company will take its place.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:27:36
Every day bcash survives and stays in the top 10 is a reminder that it is biting at Bitcoin's heels and has the potential to displace it, which would be very bad for the decentralized movement.

lol 1-4, 6, and 7 all apply to crypto, this is a sarcastic joke right?
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:14:20
Another contentious hard fork is not really a good solution (look at what happened with the bcash debacle and the Eth DAO hack). That will dramatically ruin trust in Bitcoin and the main chain. Also, hard forks are generally reserved for emergencies--there are ways to subtly control and censor transactions  such that they wouldn't quite constitute emergencies but would still make Bitcoin less robust/censorship resistant. If you read the paper I linked, 14 different attack vectors are outlined and described in detail. These attack vectors are only possible with high mining centralization.

I'm genuinely curious. What will be the solution to Chinese mining centralization? I heard it's around 80% currently. It concerns me because such high centralization in mining power can lead to all sorts of interesting attacks and ways to censor transactions:
