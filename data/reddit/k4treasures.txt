Finally was able to receive the Bittrex change in IP email today.  Haven't been able to log in since Dec. 31st.  (today is Jan 4th.)  Still not sure what the problem was.  I did contact my email provider for Outlook (support and they were going to look into the problem.  So not sure if they did something to fix it, or if Bittrex did.  Have not heard from either Bittrex or Outlook support yet.  Good luck!

Trying to figure out if it's a problem on email or Bittrex side. I have Outlook for email. Do u mind me asking what u use for email?

Sorry to hear. I've also used different computers, phones. Doesn't help. Interesting that u can sometimes get in if it detects the same IP. I haven't been able to get in at all yet. This makes me think it's a problem with the Bittrex side. Was wondering if it was a problem on the email side. I have Outlook for email. What about u?

Sorry to hear. I think the problem lies with the growing pains of Bittrex as well! I did add Bittrex and mailer to my safe sender list n safe mailing list. Don't know if that's why I was finally able to log in or not because wasn't able to get into Bittrex for a couple days after added to safe lists. Or maybe Bittrex is randomly disabling emails. If that's the case, Very frustrating! Another suggestion from my email provider is to unlnk mobile phones from email then add to safe sender and then log out and in. They said sometimes this action of safe sender takes a while to go through. They had me try after 24 hours. Didn't work then, but did work after like 36 hours.  Still don't know if that's the reason why started receiving emails again. Good luck!
