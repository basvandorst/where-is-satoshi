THIS.  Transfer your crypto purchases from Coinbase to GDAX and withdraw from there to avoid massive fees.  Coinbase own GDAX, so use that to your advantage.  You simply log into GDAX with your existing Coinbase details.

Yep, sold absolutely every bit of crypto when BTC broke below 6k (was my stop loss so to speak).  Don't think i will be buying again till below 2k if at all.  Lost everything.

I don't think the intention was ever to fight to make governments take Bitcoin seriously.  I always thought the whole point was to create a system that was better than what we had, therefore making government,banks and fiat irrelevant.   Ie, build a new model that makes the old one obsolete.

I have Xapo, Wirex, Cryptopay and have just signed up for Bitwala.  My own experience is that Xapo is best simply due to the instant conversion of BTC-&gt;FIAT at point of sale. You only convert exactly the amount of BTC you are spending.  The others just feel far less slick, as you need to "load up" your prepaid debit card before spending.  First Impressions on Bitwala is it looks really good but still waiting on Level 2 verification to see how their Card aspect works.  Will update on my experience with Bitwala....but for now Xapo all the way.  Jessie in Xapo Support is utterly fantastic.

Didn't end up getting verified for Lev2 as the process was painful.  In fainess I now should mark Xapo down as I tried to use my card while on holiday and it kept stating WRONG PIN even though the Pin was entered correctly and matched what was shown on the app. All in all, I think debit cards are a "nice to have" but still have all the usual failings of any centralised service.  I have moved all BTC out of all 3rd party services and shall keep it this way.  Shame too as I really did like Xapo.....just didnt like being let down when it mattered most to me.

Don't worry bud,  there will be products created soon for you non-tech types.  In the meantime try and learn a bit more about why its worth the effort, despite your reservations.  Remember the issue isn't with the Bitcoin network but the current third parties most people are forced to trust.
