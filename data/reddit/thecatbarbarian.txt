Ha I got my paycheck last month and I can't pay the electricity bill today! the irony!

you know the reason, I know it, they know it: because you can't sit on your arse and get rich from doing nothing with normal, functional money
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:40:47
and they aren't, because nobody accepts them or even have heard about them, especially in Venezuela where people can't afford to speculate on such nonsense.
In case you want to know, the currency used in black markets there is USD, because it's actually worth something right now has been stable and predictable for hundreds of years
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:57:09
haha, how nice that you keep projecting your insecurities on me. I bet you're salty you didnt get in a few years ago and you don't get to be one of the big boy millionaires. Instead all you're doing is making them richer, while being smug and deluded that you'll become one yourself

a random pro-trump conspiracy theorist libertarian blog? I'll pass

We'll see, the idea that deflation fixes itself without interference was contradicted during the Great Depression, which some argue is the best and most devastating example of a deflationary spiral

it's just a fork of bitcoin, nothing more nothing less. No reason to call it a shitcoin just cause its forked. Forking was intended to be possible from the beginning, how else could Bitcoin have updates at all while remaining decentralised?
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:16:25
nice job with not countering any point I made, but I understand you're probably to deep in bitcoin it to risk denying what you're part of.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:56:40
with transaction fees this high there's no reason to pretend it's a viable currency anymore, everyone here just wants to get rich
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:08
you get downvoted but I just want to say thanks, it's good to know and I'm sure there are many others who remain silent but are glad to be informed on the subject.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:53
My country's currency has been stable and predictable for hundreds of years, so they win there. 
I know that my central government and banks are manipulating my regular currency to keep inflation steady but I have no freaking clue who is manipulating Bitcoin and/if they can succeed with doing it, so hmm they win there again
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:21:15
well legally it could be a problem if someone owned Bitcoin but since it is decentralized noone can trademark the Bitcoin name or logo
When LibreOffice forked from OpenOffice they couldn't just name it OpenOffice Prime or something due to copyright
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:28:52
Bitcoin cash would run in the same problem one day, and I bet people will hate on the new fork there just as much as they do here
Call it: the circle of greed
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:35:01
you can read other posts from the blog you know, and yeah I wont consider it to be even close to being reliable information due to all the other nonsense that's posted in there
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:07:36
boohoo, keep trying to attack me instead my posts because you can't come up with actual counterarguments. I guess you also think that only who has the last word has won the argument, because it really seems you have nothing to say anymore (if you ever did) it's been fun
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:06:54
Indeed you'd have to be an idiot to not buy your ps4 with normal money, your normal money will be worth less tomorrow, your bitcoin might be worth 10 percent more
Unless some kind of apocalypse happens which destroys all central banks and all their conventional government backed-money (which also somehow leaves the internet completely intact), bitcoin or any other crypto will never become a major currency in legal markets
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:54
I love how bitcoin has ideologically grown from being a decentralized currency anyone can use to being the currency only the very rich can feasibly afford to use
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:12:07
lol ok, glad for you but it being a ponzi scheme means there are suckers and there are winners. You pass on the hot potato and the last one to hold it gets the financial ruin that comes with it. I hope you already cashed out that x4 roi because otherwise you really havent made anything yet since, again, bitcoin is not a currency.
Also you didn't even make a point to begin with there was nothing to counter, I explained what a ponzi scheme is because you made absolutely zero effort to do so, probably because you can't
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:30:58
I know, I know. I don't really think any inherently deflationary currency is economically sound anyway, just poking fun at the situation
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:32:09


complete bollocks and and an insane lie, how can people say this crap with a straight face. a "currency" with 20 dollar transaction fees is somehow saving an extremely impoverished country where the average monthly wage is 30 dollars a month?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:22:22
it wasn't made to be a ponzi scheme, but everyone here just acts exactly like you would if it was a ponzi scheme
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:59:51
people like you are delusional, of course you'll deny reality because everyone in a ponzi scheme wants to keep the charade going for as long as possible.
Nobody is spending bitcoins, except a small market of people who want to buy drugs, bitcoin's prize increase relies on the next sucker being willing to buy it for more than you bought it. That's literally where all it's value now comes from.  The sooner you bought in the more you benefit with this nonsense going on, it is also the exact definition of a ponzi scheme
The only reason I'm even here is because I'm sick of all you wanting to push your pyramid scheme on me everywhere on reddit, trying to endlessly pull people in so you can keep your bubble growing
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:36:51
It's great for the greedy individual, but it would grind the economy to a halt, you think you'll invest into Joe's Startup when you could just sit on your own money and do nothing with it instead, potentially making even more? Nope
There are plenty of other issues as well, such as loans becoming impossible. But I'm sure nothing would convince someone like you anyway you're just here to make a quick buck and so am I
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:49
It's important for them that people see Bitcoin Cash as a second kind of bitcoin though, imagine if Bitcoin Cash went up on on coindesk as "BCash" ppl would think "What is this new coin" instead of "What is this second bitcoin" like they do now. It might look like arguing semantics but you have to see how it's not "just a name that doesn't matter to anyone"
I think both people in the interview were well aware of what I wrote above though
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:11


The problem is nobody (not a single employer) will every pay you in bitcoin so you will always have to buy some with normal cash. Thus you'll always have a choice between your bitcoin and your normal currency. And it will always make more sense to spend your normal currency
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:56:27
a few weeks ago it was 5 dollars for instant transactions and half a dollar for waiting 24 hours, without some serious updates the dream of bitcoin becoming a widespread currency is simply dead
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:58:58
I guess in the magical future where everyone uses bitcoin noone will have to work I guess, since we'll all get rich from sitting on our bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:38:37


only if you agree that bitcoin is a bubble, if you see it as a real investment you'd want improvements to be made as a more useful product will lead to higher prices
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:14
that's a decentralised market for ya, people are learning the difference between normal stock and cryptos quite well it seems
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:27:27
It's more like North Korea 1 vs North Korea 2
