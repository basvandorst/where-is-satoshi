The price peso will drop today nobody knows, Google the historic destruction of the value. Not even the president knows. Probably will drop 60% or more after this crazy Soviet Union style measure

m from Argentina and you dont know how things work here. The right term is "peronismo" that is a mix of fascism, socialism, kleptocracy, mafia, marxism and just plain retardation. Peronismo has held power longer than any other force. Current goverment and next goverment are peronistas too, and peronism always was in charge, when they are not, they do coup d'etats like 1989 and 2001

Zimbabwe is a kleptocracy, very different thing, and very similar to Argentina goverment

Who is the Argentina citizen, you or me ? You don't have idea what peronismo is

Im from Argentina and you dont know how things work here. The right term is "peronismo" that is a mix of fascism, socialism, kleptocracy, mafia, marxism and just plain retardation. And this was simply a arragment with Macri from the Kirchner mafia: "do this, or else" ; current president is going to end dead, in prison or exile... remember Cristina killed the prosecutor that dared to investigate her

you cant exchange pesos to dollars for a bigger amount than 200 usd per month, and the peso is constantly losing value, so basically youre forced to hold a worthless currency (the peso); like venezuela with bolivares, or cuba with cuban peso

Replace purchase with exchange , bad choice of words then... You can't purchase more than 200 USD with the worthless peso, so you're forced to finance the government holding a currency that devaluates like crazy every day

@_date: 2019-12-23 19:00:43
Haha yes, when the government cuts your power and water and internet to punish "rebel population" that didn't voted for them... Bitcoin get useless... My little town gets often power cuts as punishment because Kirchner lost the elections in this area.
@_date: 2019-12-23 08:09:50
Argentina 2001, the banks stole 100% of your savings. My mother lost 100K USD for example. Thats why I keep guns, bullets water tuna cans toilet papers US dollars and gold bullion
No Bitcoin because government monitors all your online transactions. Also they cut internet and power supply to punish "rebel" population

I'm from Argentina, government forbid us from saving more than 200 USD per month and also put a 30% tax on savings, foreign trips, etc etc (for example Netflix) and many other confiscatory tax (like 2,5% on value of your house)... This is new law this week. That's why people hoard cash. Not criminals. Just honest citizens trying to avoid criminal governments that also have the monopoly of the force (Venezuela, Argentina, most of Africa and Middle East, China, etc). Cash is freedom from oppression.
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:00:44
Argentina pegged the money to the USD, check what happened in 2001... That's a economic bomb waiting to explode...
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:54:21
You can't exchange the peso for foreign currency , and the peso devaluates like 30% weekly, so you can't save. Buying more than 200 USD/EUR/foreign currency per month is forbidden by law and a crime. Hope you understand how it works. If not, Google in Spanish "Argentina cepo cambiario" and translate the thousand articles you will see.
So the "tax" you savings by forcing to hold pesos and brutal devaluation 
For example,.I sold last week a old computer for 25 000 pesos, around 350 USD back then, since the peso devaluated 30% this week, I already lost money, because I could not change the money fast enough (illegally) to US dollars for example
The exchange jumped from 63 ARS per USD to 85 ARS in less than a week
@_date: 2019-12-23 19:17:02
Greeks put a new law to force you to spend 30% monthly. Since they cant devaluate the euro, they take those measurements. Here the government just prints pesos like toilet paper so they rob you that way, with mega inflationary policies
@_date: 2019-12-23 18:59:11
I didn't, but most of fools did. Like 41% didn't voted for them
 But you have lots of useless fools that love sucking from state tit
@_date: 2019-12-23 10:11:02
Check the new law , only 200 USD per month saving allowed and 30% punish tax on trip spending, Soviet style shit right there

Never bring money to the bank in the first place, that's what we do here after banks stole all our savings in 2001

Some of those "illicit activities" is the way the governments say "we cant steal your hard work" ...  here is illicit to just save money, thats why people hoard foreign cash.
