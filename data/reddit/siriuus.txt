My phone, nothin fancy. But you got to roll each hour for bitcoin you can get up to 0.01751714 of a bitcoin in a hour. Cool app it’s free. It’s called literally “Free Bitcoin”

What about $800-ish? Would that be a ok miner?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:58:44
Is there any good asic miners for like 800?
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:00:07
That is true but I have 0.02$ in. That’s almost anything, and if I lose it I wouldn’t really care
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:53:44
Yeah. But I actually use a toaster

I started yesterday so I don’t expect a lot, and I’m waiting to save up like $400 computer to mine BTC. Also can you mine while playing on the computer? And is $400 computer a decent Bitcoin miner?

Is there one you can suggest
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:59:26
No, and I want to start. And I’m trying it out to see if I actually get the bitcoin, and if it’s worth to keep until o get a computer good enough to line bitcoin good.

That’s the highest you CAN get, which is extremely rare. Right now I have 0.0000007 of a bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:09:35
No, that’s the highest anyone can get that would be at 6 months of getting a chance to get that on the app.

Thanks! I’m actually investing in bitcoin, and I’m trying to find others I can use to.
