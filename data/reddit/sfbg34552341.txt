How do they know if a transaction is 'educational' or for that matter 'business'?  What happens if you wire the money to 'Bitstamp University Slovenia' or 'Mr. B. Stamp'?

Do you have any idea what the relevant law is called? I wouldn't trust bank staff to know what they're talking about tbh.
edit: actually I suspect this is not a 'law' but maybe some kindof restriction on your account.

Maybe they know that you can't do it, but I wouldn't really trust their explanation of why not. I've been searching all over and there are now essentially no capital controls in Pakistan. It could be that most Rupee accounts are not enabled for sending SWIFT transfers and they just allow 'one off' payments manually processed by the bank staff. If that's the case you can probably just open some other kind of bank account and the problem will disappear (I think this would be the case if you opened a EUR or USD foreign exchange account for instance) but that might be more trouble than it's worth too.

You might be right.. but that rule seems aimed at stopping people operating a business using their personal bank account.. in most countries operating a company using a personal account will probably cause it to be closed as soon as they notice anyway so nothing extra ordinary there.
However.. buying bitcoins for personal use is imo clearly not a 'business purpose'.. so this shouldn't apply... but I guess you still need to convince the teller of that somehow.
