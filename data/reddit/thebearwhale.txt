will you be saying the same when it comes out teather is a total scam as well as I'm sure it is 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:40:39
sounds like you lost money with that snark 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:09:15
so you are like me and think teather is not backed by anything then?

nice bit of info, I always use it in the Marxist sense which would mean most the hodlers on this sub add no benefit to society and are basically the rich capitalist elite who live of their inflating wealth as OP sounds to be

I fail to see the difference between koran and japanese salarymen  and US style of "take your work on a holiday" and slavery.
it's the same push/pull---working to earn the basic means to survive.
Thankfully i take a more European attitude to work/life balance and don't consider myself a wage slave like most the world who has to perform labour to eat

Not all slaves are/were beaten you know,
I'm Irish and people were indentured servants on their own lands during british rule meaning they were essentially free slaves who did the work of their capitalist overlords in return for the right to not be kicked off the land completely. and don't forget paying rent/tax to use your own land. 
Capitalist society is exactly the same today, you either work for your bread and shelter or you are out on the street homeless and destitute

that quite an assumption.
I just associate  the term with more Marxist line of thinking but to answer your question I'm more in favor of small government and cooperative ownership, capitalism is basically a lesser form of slavery

Ugh, this is why I can't wait to short this bubble again. 
You people actually have this superiority complex, probably boast about your IQ as well

I'm beginning to wonder if something serious is up at LocalBitocins.
Currently, it can take up to a month to get a reply from support but yet they have time to do KYC on every new customer they signup.
As someone else said I wouldn't be surprised if they are now a honeypot working with law enforcement to out people buying bitcoin with cash.
For sure they are doing everything possible to not give out a trustworthy vibe right now and I'm using paxful as my peer to peer platform of choice now

The Peer to Peer aspect will become more and more clear in the following years. Why use banks when you can give power to the people!
@_date: 2014-10-04 16:29:54
Get out while you still can. 
$99 sounds like a nice number though

Are you hiring?
I'm a Finnish based English speaking SEO/WebDev/Marketing professional and early bitcoin adopter who has trouble getting in the door of many Finnish companies becasue of language requirements and unfortunately freelance work doesn't count for much on your CV here. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:12:00
Thanks, will do. 
FinTech is my area of interest and knowing how you are already very familiar with the regulatory structure here I may actually have something of value.

Well if you want to choose between Localbitcoins and Paxful I would go for paxful. I made several trades in both  , localbitcoins doesnt have as much variety as paxful has and also the customer service has been super so far. As for in Localbitcoins I have had my cases stuck more than a week with the support...

I think once a continent as Africa shows prosperity others will follow and this will be huge. Remember guys this is just the beginning of the Peer to Peer revolution. Its one of the biggest financial changes that has happened in the field of finance. Buckle up boys, this will ship will fly to the sky!
