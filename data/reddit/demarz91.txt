Cool, what's the best way to go about learning about it? Should I take a class or do you know of any youtubers I could watch?
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:11:42
What is it?
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:52:24
That's obviously not what I meant. Of course I CAN invest. The question was whether I SHOULD or not. I was asking if BitCoin is still a good investment. Because there is such thing as a bad investment. I didn't want to make a bad investment, so I figured I'd ask the people who are invested in BitCoin if they are still making money off of BitCoin, but I thought it would be a bit too pushy to ask straight up if people are still getting rich off of BitCoin. Perhaps the way I worded my question was a little stupid, but it was an honest question and I would like honest answers.

Sounds like it's for money to me

I know I have a lot to learn that's why I joined this subreddit, am I in the wrong place or something? If BitCoin isn't about making money then what is it about?
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:59:51
What exactly does that mean? could you please explain? sorry im really new to bitcoin lol thats why im asking if its worth getting into now

I first gained and interest in BitCoin when it blew up back in 2016 I think it was. I had no money at the time. Wish I did, I could have lots of money at the moment. Lol

Lol I know I realize that know. I'm stupid
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:34:38
Haha, I won't lol. If you don't mind me asking... how much do you typically invest per month? If you feel uncomfortable answering I understand
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:35:23
How do you learn what days are best and ways days are worse to invest?
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:28:42
So you think it's still worth getting into?
