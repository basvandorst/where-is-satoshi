Sorry I don't remember his name but I'm sure you can find out easily if you google for PIA Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:13:36
One of the guys at PIA worked for Mt.Gox. Now I'm sure everyone here knows that video of Ver shilling Mt.Gox. No surprise that PIA would take his side and back his altcoin.

r btc was used to shill eth earlier this year and probably a bunch of other altcoins altogether. just take an objective look at the front page of that sub 6 months ago, it was literally eth pump and Bitcoin FUD, now its bch pump and Bitcoin FUD. its so fucking obvious

Dude you are using the internet right now, think for a seccond lol

I just wanted to point this out about the graph which was used in the tweet. I posted this on the other sub (because I try to actively fight back against all the FUD and the intentional misleading):

Lol okay man definitely as bad as ISIS and people who do acid attacks and genital mutilation
Being skeptical is does not make anyone a bad person, because for all you know the whole pineapple fund thing could be a ploy, a BCH marketing campaign with a huge budget that was planned from the start. There are sadly MANY things that lead to believe this. Doesn't mean the donations aren't a good thing.

It's a shame it's called r/btc because it literally is used for nothing but  speading FUD about Bitcoin. They should rename it to r/btcfud or something. It's not even like they can just stfu and focus on their own project, no the front page there needs to have at least 10 anti-Bitcoin posts voted to the top every day. And don't even try posting something Bitcoin-positive over there as the thread won't get more than 10 upvotes and the top-voted comment will be some sort of "b-b-b-but here is why Bitcoin actually sux!!! guise right? guys?"

You can call it not phishing if you want, you can find a definition on any given website for anything you like to support your own argument or opinion about something. It's very clearly phishing when it's phishing for your money which in my opinion is exactly what Bcash does when it wants to make you believe that it's Bitcoin and you put your money into the wrong market.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:33:35
But we don't? The only thing you need to trust is the code that's doing the work and the fact that the system is decentralized. Everyone can verify both things to be true for himself if he wants to.

No, it's like walking by a place called McDonald's that isn't McDonald's but makes no effort to let you know it isn't and in fact makes a lot of effort to make you believe that it is. This is phishing because it's trying to steal people's money under false pretense.

The problem is not that they are clutish but that the subreddit is called btc when it's objectively only existing to constantly spread FUD about Bitcoin and pump altcoins. There used to be a huge phase spring of this year where they pumped the shit out of Ethereum, now they are doing it with their own bcash, who knows what's next.
It's lies and deceiving. There should be an official PSA to make newcomers aware of this fact.

I can buy PC hardware or groceries with Bitcoin, I cant do shit with any other coin, except trade for Bitcoin. Keep shilling your pump and dump shitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:26:24
other coins cant be used for anything... literally the only thing you can do is trade them for Bitcoin so you can actually do something with it. whats your point?
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:03:47
Its clear as day that those people missed the boat on Bitcoin and just want a free and easy get rich quick scheme, they dont give a shit about "the technology", all they want to do is pump and shill their altcoins so they can cash out for BTC and/or USD in the end
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:46:02
Only? That's still a whole lot of money. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:21:35
He is right though.
You are right as well in that governments can't ban Bitcoin. However, they can make it illegal for merchants to accept Bitcoin.
In that case the only option would be to move to countries that are open to Bitcoin (like Japan), so the countries who make it illegal will suffer a massive wealth and brain drain.

The fact that this idiot thinks he has anything meaningful to say because "b-b-buh I'm a millioneer" as his argument... I don't know what to say. How some people can support such a "CEO" is beyond me. He hasn't produced anything of value and only got lucky because of getting into crypto early.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:10:42
Almost. It's the fiat equivalent of someone starting up his own money printing machine and printing out completely different bills while expecting everyone to treat them as original central bank bills.
Will they have any value? Depends solely on the market.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:10:21
You're not wrong, but crypto is still in its early stages. The energy consumption is still quite low compared to other things. It's expected that we will have 100% renewable energy at some time in the future. We're on a good way because technology is constantly improving towards that. It's safe to assume that by the time Bitcoin requires "unhealthy" amounts of energy it won't matter because it will all come from renewable.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:28:56
I think people should stop saying Bitcoin is a protocol because that's misleading and confuses newcomers. Bitcoin is technology, the protocol is part of that. But it is a lot more than just that protocol. I agree with your points though obviously.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:16:29
you make no sense, since obviously it will go through some peoples hands way before being "circulated out"... how has that not crossed your mind? this is about awareness
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:59:52
You don't need to sign up, just download a wallet and do a private transaction with the person. It's hassle-free.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:03:01
Don't be too hard on yourself, just think about it this way. There is no difference between having held 10 BTC at a price of $100 back then, or simply having had $1000 back then. Both scenarios had the potential to give you massive profit if you kept the BTC... or spent the thousand dollars on it. And how many people had $1000 to spare when BTC was $100 each? Pretty much everyone. So you're in the same boat as 99% of people.

You don't think that Bitcoin can replace currency because you think short-term. When gold was first used as a currency (and it was back in the day) I am almost certain that it took years and years before gold could reach a point where all sides of supply and demand could agree on a certain exchange rate.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and I am positive that in the future the volatility will decline proportional to the real-world adoption of Bitcoin. Right now we are in a hype phase where Bitcoin is going mainstream so the demand makes the price skyrocket.
A lot of people are buying in right now just for the investment aspect, going for short-term profits and seeing it as nothing but a way to make quick money, not even realizing the potential behind the technology. Bitcoin is a revolution that can solve many of today's problems, similar to how the discovery of electricity could, or the invention of the internet. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:58:34
Thing is that pretty much no other cryptocurrency has any meaning in the real world because of a lack of network and adoption. They exist as pump and dump schemes to make people more Bitcoin. There are some exceptions but the real-world network built around Bitcoin is the most important thing that matters and no other cryptocurrency even gets close to that level.

1. You are stupid for not putting "your" Bitcoin into your own personally owned wallet as soon as possible
2. Try lawyering up
3. There is a very high chance you will not see those Bitcoins again

I can't speak for Japan, but do you have any idea how bad the internet infrastructure in Germany is? It is a well-known and acknowledged fact. I am paying for a 100mbit down connection, of which on average I receive about 25mbit. On bad evenings it drops as low as 2mbit. And it's not a problem that could be solved by switching providers, because that is literally the only provider who sells speeds that high, the next one after that in my area has 16mbit maximum. This problem is existent all over Germany, especially in crowded areas, or very rural ones, and it is not like this is a topic that is up for arguing either because it is even acknowledged by official state and private media, that we have a big problem with internet infrastructure in our country because our minister who is responsible for it mentally lives in the stone age and is not doing his job.
In fact, there was an article just today on computerbase.de 
which talks about exactly this problem. 
So please don't call it a "most fail argument" when you don't even know how bad it really is.
EDIT: I forgot to mention this what I still wanted to say, recently there was even a debate that a new law will be introduced which will force internet providers to advertise the ACTUAL speed that they are selling. E.g. in my case they will have to say "theoretical 100mbit, average 25mbit" when they sell you the plan. Yes this is how bad it really is, look it up. Because as of now millions of people are getting ripped off when it comes to their internet plans.
@_date: 2017-05-02 23:00:55
exactly and that is why people who missed the boat on Bitcoin now are getting desperate because the price keeps going up and up, buying in is not cheap (compared to the past), getting into mining takes even more money, so their only chance is to shill altcoins to pump and dump. I dont think anyone there has any Bitcoin which is why they put most of their effort shitting on it and shilling their altcoins because they are greedy fucks who want a quick get rich scheme (not saying I am any better, I would probably do the same if I missed the boat on Bitcoin)
this becomes extremely clear when positive Bitcoin news are never upvoted there whereas they always take any chance they can get to jump down Bitcoins throat, or like this one guy I recently replied to over there who was shilling his altcoin in every single post in his thread, like it couldnt be more fucking obvious.
it is healthy to assume that 90% of all posts (if not more) on that subreddit is people trying to manipulate you into putting your money in alts, whereas 90% of posts in this subreddit is people holding Bitcoin and wanting it to keep going up

Why are you trying so hard to refute every point? You literally don't want your "questions" answered you just try to make Bitcoin look bad. North Korea can't block Bitcoin, they can block the internet, they are two different systems altogether.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:49:41
that subreddit is 90% people who missed the boat on Bitcoin and are invested in altcoins. their goal is to make Bitcoin look bad and pump their altcoins so they can cash out (to Bitcoin ironically). you just need to look at the type of threads and posts that get upvoted there. anything thats voted to the top is absolutely anti Bitcoin. even slight pro-Bitcoin posts or threads get very little upvotes and always have people call out "but here is y ur wrong, now buy this altcoin instead who can do it better". its a clear pattern over there. Ive been calling it out in some posts feel free to check my history to see what I am talking about, there were some extreme cases lately where it is so freaking apparent that its full of alt pumpers

B-b-b-but r/btc told me that Bitcoin is worthless, unusable and broken and can't buy anything and is being dropped by all merchants and I have to use their shitcoins to buy things instead... OP pls don't lie.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:31:26
It's a currency if you want to use it as such. It's a store of value otherwise. If you decide to use it to buy something (like I do regularly), then you simply have to have the mentality to not look back. It's greedy and unhealthy. Instead I spend it happily because I know I am getting things for "free".
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:44:01
B-b-b-but the other subreddit has been telling me that Bitcoin is dead and gone and useless in the real world!!!
