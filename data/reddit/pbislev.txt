Bitcoin have been in a bear marker several times in the past decade, while the stock markets only had major consolidations in 2015 and 2018. Gold actually went up in value in the last recession, because a gold ETF was launched (gold did 5x in value) and the banks had a major crisis in the last recession. 
Who knows what will happen to the price og BTC. BTC has a fixed supply and the inflation rate is declining. The same isnt true for the stock markets, because the money circulation in the stock markets have increased a lot due to Quantitative Easing (central banks printing money and buying bonds and stocks). I believe that the next crisis will involve the banks. Just look at deutche bank their stock price went from 150$ to 6-7$ despite the market being in and uptrend. The same thing happened to Lehmann Brothers before their bankruptsy. Deutche Bank is a much larger bank and the fact that they are on the edge of bankruptsy is bad for the entire banking industry since the banks have a lot of debt and dependcy to each orher.  
if we look at gold: The value of gold is much more related to the value and trust in the dollar and the banking system than in the stock markets. The gold and the dollar are inverted to and another meaning a strong dollar means falling gold prices and vice versa. 
I am a bitcoin bull: There's so much coming Up: BTC ETF, new exchanges launching (bitpanda global is one example), the BTC halvening and Bitcoin ATMs. 
Why am i bullish for BTC as a store of value: historically the dollar has been a poor store of value. Just look at the purchasing power of the dollar in the last century. 1 dollar in 1920 would be around 100 dollars today. If you work for 60 years from today, how much would the money you earn today, actually before at your pension?
