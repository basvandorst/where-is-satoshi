So buying a BTC even at this price is a good investment, you say? That's an insightful message, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:48:52
Can you link to the website? This is a really GOOD news if you guys can come up with a real exchange. I'd absolutely love to be a part of this new project. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:51:47
That's how I do it. 
1) Obtain the BTC-e deposit address for BTC
2) Transfer btc to this address using Multibit
3) Wait for 45 minutes or 3 confirmation
This is much easier. This is why Bitcoin is so powerful, as moving it from one place to another barely takes any time.

Superb, superb way to spread the word about Bitcoin! Wish I could do that. I have already told my friends about BTC, but many of them think it's very expensive now (which it is for most of us Indians).
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:57:47
I truly understand. If I was a seller, I would make sure I get some profit but what they are asking is simply unacceptable. This is because, I assume, there are only a few sellers here in India.

What are your thoughts about today's Senate hearing? Should be buy before or after the hearing?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:58:02
Asking same question since two days. Back then, it was 450 and now it's 800 dollars. Is it too late? My mind says yes, but somewhere I believe if I don't buy now, the price will shoot up to $2000 very soon.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:13:29
Two questions:
- I have so many addresses. I mean, block chain gave me one address. And on multibit I have another receiver address. And whenever I visit some local site related to bitcoin, they gave me another address. With so many addresses out there, how do we make sure everything, our bitcoins, stays at one place?
- I want to know how can I confirm the address I have is actually working alright. How can I do that? Can someone send me 0.000001?

It's a big market, yes, and there are a lot of "hustlers" here who, I am surprised, haven't even heard of bitcoins. This has happened in the past -- we are not usually the first to catch up with anything that's new. 
I want to board the train early, which is why I am here. Looks like those third-party companies (barely a few) wouldn't let us capitalize the market.
One local guy I talked to asked $1100 for one bitcoin. Right now, on GOX, the rate is $655. The current exchange sites -- which are barely few -- are merely an illusion, because they are here to profit big time.
When the prices went down, the buysellbitco.in told me they are out of stock, leaving me totally frustrated.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:48:25
There already exist r/bitcointip which is how many people tip here. I got my first btc (although .00000x) from here. Really thankful for those folks. Since then, I have only spread the word about BTC to everyone I know.

Hi, I am not sure what do you mean by active community. If you are referring to regular meetups, then no! Not yet.
However, a lot of localbitcoin sellers have stopped selling because the price went down so low. 
And about international wire transfer, it's not that difficult. However, it's expensive. What I am doing at the moment, which is costing me a lot of money and time, is buy a .x btc at a premium price, transfer them to BTC-E and hopefully multiply the coins by trading. So far, the experiment didn't yield any mind-blowing profit. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:22:08
Thanks! I have been reading forum threads, blog posts, etc. for hours. You answered all my questions! Thank a ton.
And I am exploring options in India. There is a site, localbitcoins, and I see a lot of people in my city selling bitcoins. However, the sellers are charging (if I convert into USD) 650 dollars for one bitcoin. 
They are jacking up the price! Why would I pay 650 dollars when I can get one bitcoin for 540 or so from BTC-e (another noob question). 
Also, thanks for the advice. I don't want to become a hardcore trader. I simply want to increase my current capital. I was planning to invest $800 in parts - first buy a bitcoin for $100, then buy another bitcoin for $100 next week (when it drops) or so (and sell at the right price). Once I have a substantial capital and confidence, I intend to collect Bitcoins as an asset.
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:41:17
You can either sell it for real cash or use it to buy something you want. There are a lot of sites that allows you to buy things using bitcoins, although they are limited to certain countries.
This site gives a list of places where you can use your BTC: [
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:15:39
The article will definitely create more awareness in India. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:10:59
Whoa! The article makes no sense to me. Why? Because I am an Indian and I am struggling to buy BTC.
First thing, we have no "real" exchanges.
Next, the website that was mentioned in the article (buysellbitco.in), charges premium. See, for example, their website asks 75k (which is more than GOX price) including the hefty 2k fee for one bitcoin! 
But here is the worse part: they are "buying" BTC from us at a significantly lower price. Right now, those guys are buying from us at 69k!
That's a whopping 6k difference. Almost $100!
Tell me, how do I, as a Bitcoin fan, profit from this? Forget profiting, if this is how they do business, I doubt even hoarding a coin will be possible for me.
Also, let's not forget that there are 1.2 billion Indians. I have done my best to spread the word about BTC, but I had to pay a premium to get xx.xx BTC!
The article was written just to spread the word (which is good) but in reality, Indians are way behind in this game just because of regulation and other nonsense laws put forth by our good government.
Edit: I must also add that the website sometimes shows very low price. Why? That's how they freakin' roll! From past 2 days I was trying to buy, but all I get is "out of stock" and "try again" message. This is a nice way to trick users into believing that the site is functional. Sure, I don't mind them profiting but there is a fine line between profiting and looting. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:27:07
As an Indian, I'd like to see a website that shows BTC value in local currency and allows me to buy them at the current BTC price.
Most of the sites out there are trying to make profit -- small profits, that's okay, but they are trying to LOOT us. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:59:10

Another shitty website giving false hopes. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:10:37
I have already mentioned a couple of problems on other threads, but I will copy/paste is here. We have no "real" exchanges at the moment in India.
On Localbitcoins the sellers are plain greedy! If the bitcoin value crashes, they won't give us coins at the crashed/dropped price. Plus, they always take into account the MTGOX price. And on top of that, they do not sell if the market is doing really well.
For instance, right now one USD is INR 62. So, 770*60= 46k (technically, if we use PayPal it'd be 60 rupees). Most of the sellers are asking 55k and more for one single coin. INSANE!
There is one website, buysellbitco.in (for Indians like me, we barely have any choice), which shows significantly lower rates but it never gives us at that price. It's frustrating to see "out of stock" or "run out of coins" message. They know the prices are good, so they keep the coin for themselves. That's a shitty site, though!
On top of that, if the payment reaches them late, they will give us less bitcoins (in other words, they will decide). Sucks that they won't lock down the prices, or at least that's what I was told when I talked to them.
Truly frustrated at the moment! Wish if I had few coins, I'd be investing in my own bitcoin startup that could help all the Indians.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:35:48
Yesterday I could have bough some BTC, but I did not. Now I regret because the price is $630! I am just hoping there can be a slight fluctuation during senate hearing.

The market is huge! We are heavy buyers of gold and silver.

On top of that, there are no exchanges. Hard to believe a country with 1.2 billion people and we are still not in this BTC scene. 
 A loss is a loss -- even if it's a penny or 100 dollar. I just hope you get your money back.

As an Indian I must add that we were not "in" this game anyway.
We can always find a solution or a workaround to acquire bitcoins, but that is not the point.
Let me explain.
With all my Indian brothers we had a IRC meet to draft a press release because "raiding" houses has scared the shit out of us. Customers who have bought from that owner's website are fearing whether this whole bitcoin thing is legal or not. Some have even sold at a loss.
However, our volume is low. This means you shouldn't bother about the market crashing.
What really matters is how the government is reacting to this. Despite the RBI circular, the are probably treating Bitcoin as an underworld stuff. They know it makes life easier -- transferring money without paying taxes or fee was never this easy.
Because we are the third-largest economy in the world (in terms of PPP), other governments can follow similar act. This is what is crazy and drives me nuts!
If at all government from another country takes such severe action as our government did, and if the people protest against it, then we have a revolution! 
At the moment we are so small in numbers that our power is outnumbered. Although some of them have talked to politicians to seek advice, but I doubt that is helping.
Edit: We also don't have a "big shot" figure  supporting bitcoin, despite having so many millionaires and even billionaires.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:46:31
LOL! I agree, but I was there when BTC were 460. I was thoroughly sure the value will crash. And back then, I did not have any ways to buy a coin (I still don't, so I have to pay a premium if I actually decide to go with a BTC). 
Confused at the moment. Definitely takes some real balls to buy a btc.
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:21:51
Thanks a ton! I will stick with Multibit (as I read that offline wallets are safe and, unfortunately, the Bitcoin QT does not work on my Mac). 
About second question, I have no coins. I was about to purchase my first btc (won't be a full coin for sure) but I was wondering how to confirm whether what I am doing is right or wrong. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:33:33
Awesome! I wish the value goes up and everyone becomes rich! More power to BTC user.

Localbitcoin can be your only option. Unfortunately, some sellers ask premium. 
Here, in India the sellers ask about 30% extra... shocking, I know! This is why I haven't been able to buy a complete BTC yet (well, it's slowly becoming a dream now).

RBI is very strict from my 5 years of understanding. Those guys even forced PayPal to shut down. Technically, PayPal was one of the easiest way for us to transfer money. However, in 2010, RBI made sure that PayPal should block transferring money from one account to another.
Furthermore, last year, RBI forced PayPal to autowithdraw all the amount to the bank! None of the money should be hoarded in our PayPal account.
This also means that we lose money (if the conversion rate is low). Ultimately, both PayPal and RBI are screwing the normal people like me who wants to work online.
This is where Bitcoin shines. It's the light in the moment of darkness. God, Bitcoin is our new Batman.

buysellbitco.in doesn't work on Sundays! On top of that the prices are really high. They have a difference of almost 4000 rupees between buying and selling. Also, they are charging premium. 
They display low price, yes, but they are not selling them at the same price. I am speaking from 1 week of experience.
Whenever the prices are low, I try to grab a bitcoin only to end up receiving a "out of stock" or "please try again later" message.
I have visited INRBTC before, it is something I'd like to give it a shot. Right now, though, localbitcoin seems like my only option though. I am in talk with a seller, as I wait for the price to drop.

I had a similar thread where I asked people what's the right time to buy bitcoins! Someone sarcastically told me to wait till it reaches $500 (it was $450) at that time. Two days later, I thoroughly regret not buying it.
Never thought it'd hit $800!

Thank you! Appreciate your effort.

It's a spam, ignore the above message.

No, I am not referring to people on Reddit. I am just saying to crosscheck before believing anything. Let's say, if a person says he has 30 btc on his blockchain account, shows to the "potential" buyer. The buyer believes and pays for the 30 btc, eventually getting scammed.
Showing screenshot and talking smoothly is all one need on the Internet to scam other people's money.

I upvoted you because I am an Indian and a bitcoin fan!
Here is my comment to one of the article: 
And, once again, the site quoted in the article has scammed people before. Can't believe we don't have any real exchanges in India. Given the population, which is 1.2 billion, we are way behind in terms of BTC adoption.
This is just another article to gain pageviews.

Paying them back is a real issue. I can always pay through CC or PayPal, but you know many won't accept them. Don't have any friends in US or foreign countries, so I am naturally avoided by sellers if I say I can give the money through PP or CC. Western Union is going to cost me a lot (due to conversion from INR to USD, then hefty fees)
There will be a real exchange, hopefully, but I just hope it doesn't get too late. Unbelievable that a nation with 1.2 billion are not really much into BTC yet.

This gives a new Bitcoin user a ray of hopes. Should we be aggressive in buying bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:12:43
Haha! Country is not full of IT professionals, but yes, we do have some geeks over here. They are good workers, and probably not risk-takers (and, on top of that, regulations by our government).
However, change is permanent. And it will take us some time to get real digital currency exchanges in India. WHEN is the question... and waiting is our only option now.

Everything is giving their address? Bitcointip works right?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:11:08
They don't accept CC! Only NEFT, IMPS, and Cheque as far as I know. Concerning verification, well, that's a mandatory step. How can we know if it's safe or not. :)

Converting from INR to USD, that is where we lose money. 
Point of this discussion was to throw light on what's happening in India. Using a local, even manual exchange, is cheaper compared to Localbitcoin.
Unfortunate to see them go down the toilet though.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:14:42
Really appreciate your help! I was an idiot trying to learn without going through the Wiki. Doing it right now:  Thanks!

Wow! You are so kind... 
Merry Christmas and a happy new year!

You are comparing with the worst services. That's easy to do. In reality, we have to look up at BTC-e, GOX, and other exchanges and see where we stand. Right now, we are definitely at the bottom.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:45:54
I already posted a trade request twice. I, among the buyers, had the highest rate but for some reason no one contacted me. Perhaps it has to do with the feedbacks. More feedbacks, your listing will be shown on the top. If there are less to no feedbacks, then listing is shown at the bottom -- and the sellers will not trade with us.
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:28:59
And you have probably just made his. :)

I am holding them because I did not get much, but want to thank people for giving my first coin.

Story of my life.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:09:03
As someone who hails from India, there is a huge problem of "change." If you pay 100 rupees in a shop for a bill of 98 rupees, there is a good chance that you will receive a chocolate for 2 rupees -- instead of a 2 rupee coin.
The problem of "no change, sir" is huge! Rickshaw drivers will not give you a chocolate. Instead, they will say "leave, sir" or "next time" even if he owes you 5 rupees.
Just yesterday we 100 rupees (on a bill of 90 rupees) to an autodriver in Gujrat.
Adopting bitcoin will change everything, as we can pay the exact amount and save our money. 
All said and done, we are still a long way from using Bitcoin. There are no real BTC exchanges in India and buying a btc is very difficult, unless we can pay premium (30% extra). How unfortunate!

Purchasing houses is the smartest decision anyone could probably make. That, and purchasing land. 
Wish everyone who purchases BTC will see its value in the years to come!
What if everyone, or at least your loved ones, are rich. Money is what really buys freedom -- freedom from work and time! Then we are all a happy bunch of people. Great read!
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:20:17
I want to add that we have $200 (split in two parts) to invest. I fully agree with others that there are chances of getting scammed, but what can I say other than "trust me." PM if this interests you. :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 10:50:35
How generous are you! This is pretty amazing! Wish I could get even half of that. Seriously!

As an Indian I signed up.
Guess what? They need me to verify and there is no option to send my documents to them. No upload button.
And it took me several password resets to finally log in!
What nonsense! 
As usual, disappointed.

PM'ed you! Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:03:43
Haha! Thanks for the tip, man! Means a lot.
How come the other guy received 5x the tips? :P 
Appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:46:43
That's right! Coinbase may not add Indian bank transfer due to regulation. It's tough to move money outside of this country. This is where bitcoin shines. :)
Shame it's going down so much. I paid a premium -- had to do it -- to get my BTCs. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 06:00:18
Don't worry! The article also states that "if we are able to establish money laundering aspect then he can be arrested." You must be safe.

How to know if BTC will hit low?
