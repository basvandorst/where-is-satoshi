the price was never supposed to go this high. large scale investors have been DDOSing bitfinex and then placing large orders at the same time to send the price up. I watched it in real time the second time these people did it December 6. the market is just correcting to where it should be. all this shit about china, etc. is just wishful thinking.

the idea is pretty good but the owner spammed me in another forum, trying to get me to sell on his site instead of LBC. they should make improvements to the buying/selling experience if they want to compete with localbitcoins instead of using sock puppets on reddit. right now, as it stands, having random-ass people deposit into your bank account presents a lot of problems and liabilities

your bank is gonna close your account if they find out what you're doing with it if their name is Chase, Wells Fargo, etc. If you  reveal you are a money services buisiness and registered with FinCEN they won't do business with you still because...well, bitcoins, you know. When the bank sees deposits coming from all over the country it will send up a red flag and probably your random deposits will start an automated AML investigation (like what happened to me after ONE deposit at H---). Then one day someone you trade with is going to be a scammer who has convinced another person they met on craigslist to send them money for a car/imac/etc. and that person might file a police report on your account and get the feds involved since its different states (increasingly common situation). Then another incident could possibly be that someone will try to deposit the money, get you to release the bitcoins, then go back to the teller and say they "made a mistake" and take back the cash, thereby causing you to lose thousands (dubbed "man in the middle" attack). Bitquick is definitely a nice uber-type concept in theory, but in reality, they have eschewed liability and really the only third party that you can accept instant cash payments from a digital item (like a cryptocurrency) without violating their TOS  or causing heat upon yourself is.......paypal

the app doesn't really work well, had errors, is confusing as hell, and I lost .80 I sent to a 2 of 3 wallet. really want multisig to work.... how is that "successful"?
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:30:20
I had the same thing happen. funds locked. I am a total nerd and have been all my life, I trade bitcoin and have been doing so for 4 years. Still can't figure out multi-sig. C'mon guys....
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:28:04
not really interested in debugging ATM. the whole multisig thing you need to rethink as developers. it's confusing AF and doesn't make sense. I have a problem with the terminology. I don't know what I'm doing. and the app doesn't really give any status notifications of what's going on. it did crash that day (I guess it was a server problem) which was annoying. to wit, only supergeeks could use this. I really don't trust 3rd party escrow, which is why I tested this out, would like to implement this for my app, but now I have second thoughts. I think initially bitcoin was developed by basically two or three people, but now that all these other random people on reddit are taking over the next stage there is no uniform terminology or workflow which makes a confounding user experience.

This article is about a "poor tax." 70 million Americans don't have a bank account and pay to cash their checks. $89 billion in fees last year according to the article. We talk about bitcoin helping in the third world, but we have this problem right here in America.

I used the Robocoin ATM in venice, california at Locali (a hipster deli)  about three times, both depositing and withdraw. The first time was a pain waiting, but the next two times took &lt;5 minutes to deposit and withdraw. It's still kinda nerdy/weird at first but definitely a good start. All three times I had to wait in line with one other person ahead of me (during the weekday).

The dude's father (Irwin Schiff) is in jail for the 3rd time for teaching people for three decades how to beat taxes. The catalyst for being an anti-tax crusader was when Nixon took the country off the gold standard. So Peter is just echoing his father's thesis regarding gold. Telling Peter to let go of Gold is like telling a Christian to chill out regarding the cruicifixion.

Why can't I withdraw my money in BTC from the pro exchange in BTC (even though it says to email the customer service they tell you the opposite of the webiste)? Why did you update the pro dashboard to disable this function to transfer to the spot exchange  and why does your staff keep lying to me/giving me the run around about converting my account back to BTC from yuan? How come the phone number to BTCC doesn't work? How come you don't adjust the bTCCpro price ceiling often so it's almost impossible to trade in times of volatility (like now)? 
@_date: 2017-02-18 07:59:05
no you trade in yuan and convert the yuan to bitcoin to transfer it in/out. this is the way everyone does it until this week when they disabled bitcoin outs  without notification. [in fact, on january 4 they notified people on the pro exchange that yuan deposits/withdrawals directly to a bank were disabled. that notification was never updated. they just sneakily switched it so now you can only withdraw in yuan. ]

They're both at fault. Asian businessmen typically sign ridiculous contracts like that knowing down the line they'll renegotiate if that person is not as valuable as they thought. But Ver sounds like a total wanker as well. I mean, there are a thousand ways businesses screw people a thousand times a day but why is YOUR CASE more important so much so that you need to have your minions start multiple threads interesting only to adderall-riddled investors.

I've been borrowing and investing for four months, paid back 20btc and I run a business using bitcoins. Today I log on and see the interest rates have gone up 4-5x for a 2-4 week loan!?!?! My credit score, after paying off loans on time went from a C+ to a C-. Why would I bankrupt myself for a 200% apr to post a loan on this platform. This platform seems to be a joke or some exit scam/venture for the owners because I'm not sure how 50% interest rates are helping anyone. There are a lot of good people on there who are supportive but I'm afraid Bitlendingclub will have my business for now...
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:11:56
yeah but the staff, whoever they are, changed the functionality without notification and now I can't get my money out. they repeatedly are lying to me saying they'll convert to BTC. then today they changed the website. I have a chat log of the transcript and they called me to say they'll send me the BTC.  
I saw your lecture you gave at stanford bragging about the proexchange which you personally developed.

thank you thank you for all these RIP bitcoin articles. Also one from some chud named Bloomberg at Forbes. No wonder they are journalists - because they can't make money in the real business world so they have to write shit about it. Here is how it works, dudes: you write a lame ass articles and other idiots read it. They sell, the price drops, I buy, it goes back up because you know what? Journalists and academics don't control markets. People either use something or they don't and business is booming. So keep 'em coming its more $$$ made for me.

I dunno you should contact the poster on youtube. i remember this case and I feel horrified that this guy was actually sentenced.

kakao is like whatsapp + twitter +  an online  bank +  they have a store which sells merchandise. huge company
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:03:35
kakao company recently launched an online  bank in addition to being an messaging app with in app payments "KakaoPay" [as well as a  having twitter like blogging function]. so I'm assuming Korean users will be able to trade immediately without verification as they have already verified their bank/ID for Kakaopay. this will probably lead to a huge spike initially in volume
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:50:12
Korea is not like China. Everyone uses Instagram and Facebook in addition to Naver. Alt coin trading volume on bithumb (an extremely limited platform with no shorting, orders) is the highest in the world for ETH an DASH I think. On top of that gambling is illegal. Expect Korea/Japan volume to exceed lost China business eventually. I got the info from a Seoul based bitcoin vlogger but people say he's shady - but he does sometimes deliver interesting information, regardless of his questionable investment advice. But if you want to check it out it's bitcoin seoul

the website is just a signup/announcement - app will be released in October. Looks like they are plugged into bittrex and there will be 144 currencies available. for those who don't know kakao is  messaging app with over 95% smart phones using it. literally everyone in the country uses it more than regular calling. right now among 3 exchanges in the country, over half of BitcoinCash, ETH, DASH, and other alt-coins volume is just traded here in Korea so this app will probably accelerate things if it takes off.
