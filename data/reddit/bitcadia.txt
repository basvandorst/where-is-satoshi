It's not necessarily the output that matters. Spending energy itself is a signal. If you allot some of that spent energy to getting my attention, you signal to me that what you have to say is important enough for you to throw away that energy in order to talk to me. Think of it like captcha or anti-spam. This is the absolute base value of bitcoin. Any commodity can use a base value to bootstrap itself into a currency, and then we get to these higher valuations. But the "base value as signaling mechanism" is probably much lower than the trading price for now... Just like gold's "base value as electric conductor".

In this branch, the context is SEC. Where u/Astro_naut93 said

This was in regards to the SEC. It's not mere semantics. It's according to the rules of the game at the moment. Insider trading with bitcoin isn't a thing legally, which is the context of this conversation.

Bitcoin has been ruled not to be a Security by the SEC... So, yeah, you can't inside trade it.

I wrote an article about this. I suggested a proof of stake hybrid. 
As to removing proof of work, that would remove the base valuation of the coin. That might be an issue if you think currencies need a use value. I also wrote an article about that.

It also has the potential to have more intrinsic value over marble floors in banks.

Yes, and the 4th use gives Bitcoin intrinsic value.

Twitter -&gt; Reddit -&gt; Medium -&gt; Gist seems like a good route before going straight to github to code up the idea.

If someone has my key, the game's over anyway. That "we'll burn your holdings" situation exists with RBF when it escalates to paying the entire wallet as a fee to get in the next block first.

You could also make this only apply to specific wallets, like segwit does. Then these rules would create 0-conf wallets that merchants would be able to trust.

The in the calculation done to halve the mining rewards, you subtract the amount burned because of double spends. If you haven't met the threshold for the amount of mined coins, the reward remains the same until it hits that threshold.

This is short-hand for "is returned back to a pool of unmined coins and is subtracted from the total amount of coins mined". Proof of burn so to speak.
