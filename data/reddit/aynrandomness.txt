Nuclear powerplants are super safe. Even Tjernobyl didn't cost 250 million.

Forcefully moving them away was inhumane and completely unecessary. Not having nuclear powerplants in Japan is probably also a good idea, they are prone to tons of natural disasters.

If my competitor was an idiot and a liar I would most certainly tell my customers. In fact I somewhat frequently do.

What good have the US government ever done? How many did they kill last year? How many were tortured? How many were sentenced without a trial?

It is impossible to know all or most of the risks with any decent sized investment.

Is he a mind reader? How could he know what his customers were doing?

The biggest evil of taxation is the surveilance, giving up some money is fine, telling how you earned it is pure evil.

Isn't perfect? You have the blood of thousands on your hands. Some form of governmen I am sure everyone agrees we needs, just not this kind. Or anything resembling it.

I am sitting in my livingroom, I have eaten nothing but candy and fruit I stole from my landlord today, and due to me being an alcoholic I'll leave my contemplating drinking beer to contemplating. But I do appreachiate my ability to cure the gaping hole in my soul with some organic solvents.
I am from Norway, I guess I am even luckier, not only do I get to be on the winning sides of wars (as you say, it is morally superiour to not be on the receiving end of our F16s), but I also get to enjoy the fruits of burning oil and polluting the world. I do share your sentiment that being the one chopping off someones limbs is far better than being the one getting their limbs chopped off. 
I would say some of the US is materially lucky, but if I had the choice between being a poor saint and a rich killer, I would chose being poor. I hate thinking of the poor children that got one of our bombs on their head, maybe there is some kid sitting in some shitty institution in Libya missing his legs because of my country. How can I justify that with: "Oh well, at least I have a livingroom, nobody is being violent towards me, and I can order a pizza and a pint if I so please"? 
I am in no way ungreatfull for the wealth I was born with, I won't have to work a day of my life, and I would still never go hungry, without clothes or shelter (unless I become a prostitute, substance abuser or foreinger, the social democrats hates them).

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.

If the US had spent their war money they would have healthcare, no poverty, and all kinds of fun stuff. Don't you think the people would have spent its money better than what the government did?
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:36:08
You could have a low tax, without the surveilance aspect of it. Police, courts, and military DEFENCE (as in a troop that never attacks outside the countries borders and that only fights under certain clearly defined circumstances) is the only things taxes should finance. And all this could be funded through only corporate tax. Ofcourse we would need a free society, one where laws only protect property, and ignore all the other silliness.

@_date: 2014-01-27 21:35:39
Sure, I belive in a well defined government with a strong constitution. When a government can spend trillions on war while people die due to lack of healthcare something is fundamentally wrong.
I also belive the laws should be short and simple enough that anyone can read them. I am sure I could spend a lifetime and still not be done reading all the laws in the US.

Maybe that is what we need. "Hey, I hear you are saying wrong things about bitcoin, I just wanted to tell you a little story about a guy, much like yourself. He went out and spread misinformation, then one day he woke up, and his buisness had been burnt down. It would be a shame if that were to happen to you..."

Illegal things for $7:
*A round of ammo

*A blowjob in greece
*A throwing knife
Im sure there is a lot more.

Ill insure you car for value up to 250 000. But you have to give it to me and you cant see it and if you want it back you need to tell me in advance.
