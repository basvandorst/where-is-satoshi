4 days have been positive including today. expect a negative day but that should be a buy position. it's found strength between 13 - 15. if it keeps trading in this range for a few more days, that'll be good.

Before you jump into the essay, make sure you have a format you're presenting in and what your dominant theme will be and your supporting themes. It might be good to lay it out in a dominant chronological style and then toss in some compare / contrast position and remember to start with a solid introduction and follow up with a definition paragraph so your readers will understand the terminology you are going to explore in your piece. By chronological, create it in ways that built up the early days of bitcoin and conclude by stating where it stands now and fill up in between while following that chronology.
That said, stay away from reading white papers and overly complex technical aspects. Rely on journalistic pieces to carry the weight of your paper because the good technology writers can cut through the technical jargon and give you information in a layman sense. 
If you're going to discuss the application of bitcoin, do it in a way that is relatable to the everyday person. For example it may take a week to wire money across the world but in bitcoin that transaction can take seconds. You can also play up heavily on the idea of it being a universal world currency used by failing countries as a system of currency when inflation goes rampant (ex. zimbabwe and venezuela)

Are you people forreal right now? It's been a little over 2 weeks since the ATH. 
I'm hoping it retraces to 10,500 or lower and then slowly climbs back up with support. The only reason the other coins are succeed is due to the mania of trying to always find the next outperforming market that gives you 100% gains daily.
If you're a real hodler, price fluctuations on a month by month scale shouldn't shake you since you measure time in years.

I look at altcoins and I look at bitcoin. 
I see bitcoin being used as currency the world over. I see altcoins as a paper chase by people looking for an easy way for big gains. A few may succeed but they're still no bitcoin.
If XRP goes to $6 it will be worth more than bitcoin. Really? There's no reason for it other than pure price speculation. Institutional buyers are coming on board, a futures market has been established, work continues on infrastructure since this is still very early tech with not a lot of mass adoption. I see nothing but positives for bitcoin because it's becoming more embedded into the mainstream financial apparatus. No other coin can claim that market position.
If you're feeling the FOMO for alts, look at the underlying structure that makes up bitcoin and realize it's gotten to critical mass and no one can bottle it back up. If you want to believe in it's long term value, look at who is talking about it now and how it has begun to affect the common person. 
The exchange issue is a minor one that will be solved with one thing. Time.

No idea but I've read that it tends to slump around Christmas due to traders selling their positions and with a much smaller volume. 
Here, I think home buyers see the price as "cheap" vs. the 19,800 price it was at so its been gaining confidence with only 1/4th of the full market at this point involved. 
I think the only people putting in money, are essentially the same cycle of people without any new entrants adding value and bidding up the price among themselves.

Speculation. New product, if you're first in line you can scoop some gains. Best part is those that remain long on bitcoin will allow it to trade more strongly because of longs. If you see a retracement to 12k or 13k I wouldn't be too shocked. If you got caught at the ATH then average down but don't sell just wait for the market to settle before going back in again. It's rather passionate at the moment.

it tested 12.8's today and there's still a large amount of negative sentiment if you look at the day to day trading or half day trading charts. it needs to find a floor and it won't do so in 5 minutes or even an hour at this rate it has to sustain for a few days. you might feel more comfortable when trading has settled into a boring pattern but don't go chasing swings, because they go just as quick as they come.

You wouldn't need a $1million - you would only need a transaction that is large enough to be cheaper to send than by wire or any fee based method.

You want a multi-billion dollar company to take a chance on a new technology with only 8% adoption which is not enough to be considered a consensus. Do you understand what issues might result if hundreds of thousands of customers run into a technical issue because they decided to be the "cutting edge", "lead the pack" kind of group? By virtue of their size alone, they are incapable of moving that fast even if they were fully onboard with doing so. Working with a handful of people is one thing because you can understand it from a micro level. All sorts of different variables that you, or I might not see may come into play when scaling with size, along with network implementation, updating application layers, socket layers...
My personal stance is I better damn well hope Coinbase knows what its doing before making any major implementation because I have much to lose if something goes wrong and they don't want their Lloyds of London insurance policy to have to cover any fuckups.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:29:51
average down
you bought 1 at 100 and it drops to 80 and you bought another 1 at 80 - the value you have together is now worth 90 and you've cancelled out your lost. 
you essentially keep buying on the way down small amounts to average out your portfolio
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:44:16

if you're just doing this to jump on the hype, stop now because you're going to lose your money. if you really care about cryptos you will forget you bought that for 10 years or just add to that but don't sell for $42 - that's an insult.

think of it as psychology of the buyer and seller. at some point there's going to be more buyers than sellers and sellers than buyers. If there are more sellers, other factors come into play such as automatic stop losses, short term traders, large position dumps, negative news to name a few that can affect price. 
Since this is a 24 hour market, its susceptible to all sorts of immediate, reactionary swings in relation to those conditions. When people say the price is finding a floor, its essentially that buyers are feeling comfortable about the price level being traded so it should be a good position to start acquiring to either hold, trade, short or any myriad of conditions that can last from a few seconds to possibly years if you're some guy just trying to buy btc as a store for value.

Good question.

the simplest one anyone can learn. dollar cost averaging. 
buy .005 or .010 blocks on the way down and never on the way up. set a limit sell and go from there. with enough buys / sells in place, it will fill the orders accordingly as it moves with price. of course this contingent on having a decent amount to work with and spreading out those buys / sells across 1,000 - 2,000 points if necessary. You should also not take trading advice from anyone on a message board - this is just something that I do that seems to be the easiest for a small trader to manage.

...well they could but since they are a regulated exchange they would have a class action lawsuit before dawn breaks the next day and an SEC investigation the very next hour. 
and a virtual exchange is not a novel concept

Would be great if there was a rule against changing the titles of news articles.
Whoever posts this stuff, you're not doing anyone favors by making your angle. Writers of the article get paid to create headlines, so why do you think you can do a better job?

if demand breaks through then someone has to cover a short. 
edit. i'm picturing a horde of hungry traders moaning 'GAINNNS, GAAAIINS, GAIINNNSSS' as they try to break through.

If that is instantaneous then that's the cost. Wire transfers take between 24hrs to 5 days. Compare it on those scales. What would be the price if that was handled in 24 hrs?
That's also an interesting idea to take advantage of spreads if something like an uber app for bitcoin transaction rates &amp; times. Transaction rates increase the more the network is bogged similarly to Uber rush pricing. Set your time at the rate and there you go.

how much does it cost if I want to send someone $1,000.00?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:25:58
Correct, in a 24 hour period. From that data, you can try and make meaning of it similar to what I did with my reasoning.

cool. keep personal shit to yourself.

There is no volume. The price is going up because the people that are trading it are emptying their bank accounts to prop up the price.
Compared to last Friday's volume of 82k, this is nothing and you should be careful about buying at these highs.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:41:30
its pretty damn stupid in my opinion.

Since the IRS classifies cryptocurrencies as assets, or property, capital gains **realized** on sale of these assets are taxable.

Think of all the people trading bitcoin at any time. One person buys .01 btc - one person sells 1.5 btc - another buys at 2 btc and so on and so forth. This accumulation of all buys and sells represents total volume. 
Now Friday's total volume was in the low 80,000 of btc traded in a 24 hour period. Take for today, there is only about 20,000 btc being traded which means less people are buying and selling. Right now the buyers which are more likely home traders are going to be bullish, hence the price spike.
You should look at the higher volume days to get a real understanding of what the market is valuing btc at that given time rather than what you see over a holiday break when the full market is not participating. 
When I say people buying at these levels are playing a dangerous game, I mean they will be left holding the bag when the price dips after the normal market gets back from break and it may be between the 13k - 12k price range rather than what we see now.

Can anyone answer the author's questions? The article raises some valid points that if addressed here can only strengthen any arguments for bitcoin.

make sure you're typing in correctly.
if you set a limit order, make sure where you want to buy is set to the total you want instead of the fractional cost of what you're trying to buy. 
So if you want to buy .1 at 14000 then you put in .1 at 14000 instead of .1 at 1400.00 
i'm speculating here in case this might be what you are doing.

nah i don't think so. im bearish but as a trader i like the volatility. the price really isn't justified, not at these levels and you could see it in the price drop how many hands abandoned ship. It's not over either.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:14:01
The only valuation I see here is from new blood entering the market and in part causing the volume volatility. To say that a low point has come and gone is incredibly optimistic considering I'm watching a chart that resembles a Six Flags ride. People are going to panic if some negative international news happens to pop and drive fear. Until whatever capacity issues, unsavory competitors, and limited adoption is figured out, this thing can go in any direction.

You have to report your earnings which qualifies for either short term or long term capital gains. It's not like you put in work to earn that money.

Same here but if you're looking to trade, don't look at the price, just pay attention to the swings.

Why are you regretting anything? Most of the regular world still don't know how bitcoin works and it doesn't function as a regular payment system by the masses. In my opinion, there is still a very large upside and you are arriving in a time where things are getting a bit more serious and less murky as larger financial entities start to seriously considering working with bitcoin. You're still way ahead of the game, you just don't realize it from where you are looking at things right now.

Only when you cash out. Otherwise you can buy and sell all day long w/o ever realizing those profits and not worry about a tax penalty. Just make sure to track those buys / sells.
