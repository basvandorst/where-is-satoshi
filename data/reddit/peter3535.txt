Few months back I had to pay an invoice for my proxy... it was around 5$, back then fees were high (~7$) in addition to that bitpay threw addition "network fee" of 10$!!!.
I paid it but I also created a ticked to the proxy company saying that's outrageous to pay additional fee for bitpay especially when BTC fee was high and that they should find another merchant.
Month later, new invoice, bitpay's gone new merchant and no "network fee".
I think if more ppl would raise the awareness to companies who uses bitpay we could get rid of them.

No, I think it's 1&amp; in both ways... look at the price on that picture, the difference between sell and buy isn't that big, I think it was taken when btc was around  8 850$
