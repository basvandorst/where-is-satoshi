Also, 2007 was a crummy year? No, things only got bad at the very end of 2007. Overall, it was a positive year.

So, it is, but it isn’t? Sorry, investments don’t magically retain their maximum value.

Yeah, he’s a billionaire because his dad and grandfather were both billionaires. He inherited his money from them. Difference is, they were actually smart. Most of his wealth is from his dad’s early investment in skype.

And what's that saying about a broken clock being right twice a day? He's still dumb as a box of rocks.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:50:20
Again, look at his overall performance. It’s terrible.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:02:47
Not at all, just a strong bullshit detector going off.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:42:36
It only matters if you realize those gains. It's a pyramid scheme, so if he sells now, yeah, he'll make money. But the kind of adoption he's talking about will never happen.

I’m a quant for an investment bank. Don’t try to lecture me on how investing works. His dad invested in the companies you listed. In inherited those positions.
And yeah, Trump is also a shitty investor and businessman. His only successes were the ones his dad set up for him. He inherited the Trump organization, and pretends he built it from the ground up.

Calpers was invested heavily in Draper's fund. They eventually published the performance, showing the fund performing worse than you would randomly guessing public stocks.

Wow, you really fall for all of this. I'm qualified to judge because I design machine learning algorithms for investment funds. It's my job to know this kind of performance.
As for Trump, I can see from your comment history that you love him, but he's also a fraud. His net worth is the result of two things, 1) his inheritance, and 2) building a somewhat successful brand marketing the dumb person's idea of what a rich person is supposed to be.
I'm not playing in this casino. I'm laughing at the morons who actually think any of this is worth anything. My company looked into Bitcoin, and found basic mathematical flaws. The only people still buying into it are the kind of people who fall for pyramid schemes.
As for my claim to fame? I don't want fame. But I do have a background in econ, stats, and comp sci, and I can see when someone is only successful because of their trust fund.

Look at the relative performance over several years compared to other VC firms and the SP500. DFJ consistently underperforms all of them.

My point is, Tim Draper has an overall dismal investing record. The only reason he's wealthy is because he inherited his money. The fact that one of his investments has grown shouldn't be taken as evidence of his investing prowess, only evidence that he has money to throw around. And because of his overall poor record, we really shouldn't be looking to him for any sort of investment guidance.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:07:19
He isn't up anything until he actually sells, and he's down in his investments overall. Again, there's no reason to think this guy has any clue what he's doing.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:57:01
Here's more recent tranches. Still underperforming the benchmark.
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:54:08




He inherited around $250 million in the 70s. If he had just stuck it in an index fund, he would be far wealthier today.


I'm guessing you've never read Eugene Fama.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:16:06
Yeah, it is. Again, read my comment about the broken clock. Throw enough money around and even a moron like Draper will occasionally get lucky. Listen to his actual justification for his argument. He’s a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:17:23
I’m referring to William Draper.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:20:25
Also, 600 million? Not even close.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:49:46
You seem to have an extremely simplistic view of investing. You don’t just throw money around and hope something works. You need research, business plans, and some underlying value. Look at his overall investments. He does worse than random chance. He’s a shit investor, and would be better off putting his money in an index fund. Since you mentioned trump, the same is true of him. Neither has managed to outperform the market in their overall investments.
@_date: 2018-06-12 23:25:21
Tim Draper? The guy who blew a large part of his inheritance on Theranos, and still claims it wasn't a scam? Did anyone watch him on the Bitcoin IQ2 debate? He's a moron.
