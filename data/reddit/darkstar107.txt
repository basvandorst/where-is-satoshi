As someone that doesn't follow bitcoin a lot, what is segwit?
Edit: is it the capacity increase we've been waiting for?

You're hopeless.  Google search those developer groups and you'll get lots of names of specific developers that work on BCH.  Here's a few for you though:
Neil Booth, Amaury Sechet, Tom Harding.

If the ones that work are shitcoins, what does that say about the ones that don't work?
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:49:13
Which fork's code is closer to the original?  Which one does not have absurdly large transaction fees?  Which one has more than 1 developing community that is not funded by banks?

Whatever helps you sleep at night, pal.

Might want to read the white paper, bud.  I'm not referring to Blockstream's modified one either.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:37
Seems your mods threw in the towel already. I should be banned by now and all the posts about the high transaction fees hidden/removed.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:43:04


You clearly don't have a clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:37:32
Off the top of my head, BitcoinABC, Bitprim, nchain, Bitcoin Unlimited.  
I'm saying that I've been around BTC for a long time.  I know a lot of the history and how things were before Blockstream stepped in and started taking things over.  the r/btc subreddit is a lot like this subreddit was in the early days when people were happy about new adoption instead of complaining about high fees and fighting to survive.

Quit spreading FUD!

There are more than 6 developing groups working on bitcoin cash.  Blockstream played everyone into thinking that Segwit was beneficial for Bitcoin (clearly it isn't).  I've probably held bitcoin longer than you have.

Sadly this looks a lot like my buying history.

I was going off the title of the original post, but that would have been my next suggestion.

Unless he's in Canada, then it's worth closer to $90,000.

Trying to understand this chain of thought is a waste of time.

Give me a shout if you just want to part with some without the exchange of money.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:20:08
I can just do this for you.  Send the drive to me and I'll see if I can get you some bitcoin out of it ;)
@_date: 2017-01-06 15:22:47
I thought the same way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:22:35
 BTC cancels an upgrade so everyone that supported said upgrade moves to another coin that's more in line with their crypto-desire...that's not attack. That's more BTC shooting itself in the foot.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:45:55
Wasn't lightning supposed to come out 18 months ago? Its delayed another 18 months at least. Don't hold your breath on that one.
Some people that support fast, cheap transactions will definitely go to some other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:54:35
The receiver pays the fees, and they're MUCH higher.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:35:16
Look at the original Bitcoin and then look at the 2 forks that exist now and then ask yourself which is the altcoin. Which one has changed the most code?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:59:31
Definitely not the case.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:29:29
Is BTC the old lady?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:24:48
There's lots of people that wanted bigger blocks and they didn't get it, so they're leaving to other coin(s).  You think the cancelled upgrade didn't piss a lot of people off?  Also, have you seen the fee and unconfirmed transaction count? People are getting fed up with the fees.

The safest thing you can do right now is diversify your holdings.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:18:06
This time is definitely different.

This is like my friend, who is a Subaru salesman, talking about the advantages of Subaru over Honda and Toyota.

Whenever I get a decent sum of extra money ($5k+) I struggle with putting it in a TFSA vs putting it onto my mortgage.  I know that the TFSA is likely the better investment with how low mortgage rates are right now, but having my house paid off sooner is VERY appealing!  Congrats!

I have all my bitcoin in an offline electrum wallet.  Am I good to go for the fork, or should I still transfer to a paper wallet before the fork?
Edit: Also, how will one go about transferring into BTC vs Bitcoin Cash?  Will I need to download a different wallet for each one?  Do I need to do it on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:48:05
Excellent.  It was the part about moving your BTC to a new wallet before redeeming your BCC that I was missing.
Thanks a lot for all your help!
@_date: 2017-07-28 18:13:24
Another dumb question...the private key is the 10(?) words to recover your wallet, correct?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:33:14
I asked this question elsewhere in this thread and the guy didn't know for sure...perhaps you know the answer to it?

Right. Forgot that it was called a seed. It's been a while since I needed to look at it. That's ms for all the info.

I don't frequent this sub a lot. Everyone is saying "hodl", is it word for hold?

@_date: 2017-07-31 13:58:24
Thanks for the info.  I got my private keys from Electrum so I think I'm good to go.  
Would you be able to explain your "Tip" a bit more and clarify which addresses and at what point in time, should be empty?  I'm confused as to why my BTC address should be empty before importing to BCC.  Also, should my BTC still have a balance after I import if I have bitcoin in "both universes"?
@_date: 2017-06-26 21:16:32
That gif is amazing...how have I never seen it before?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:04:39
As someone who is fairly new to bitcoin and with little free time at the moment, how exactly is this affecting bitcoin prices so much?
@_date: 2013-10-02 19:19:37
Oh ok, so it's just the amount of volume that the site dealt with?  I thought maybe he was more directly involved with Bit Coin.
