there you go, now you are communicating like an adult. 
you have valid points, but at the end of the day, people have there likes and dislikes, me personally, i think trading on 1 monitor is completely stupid and only plebs use 1 monitor.
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:32:17

@_date: 2018-10-24 14:52:02

@_date: 2018-10-24 08:41:06

@_date: 2018-10-24 14:44:53
thanks man, the bitcoin community is pretty bitter right now, so i get all the jokes. losing money is a real thing in this market, and too many people have gotten rekt. so to deal with the pain, people joke about it.  crypto is just one big ponzi after all 
@_date: 2018-10-24 14:49:13
