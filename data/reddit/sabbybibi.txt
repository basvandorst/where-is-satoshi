right... though you probably don't want to take less than your entitlement if you want your operation to be covert...
(none of this really matters though - just shuffle some identical-fee transactions around, there's plenty available, or you can make some yourself if not!)
(edit: ...or even shuffle anything at all around, not necessarily identical-fee; the most covert shuffle would be of contiguous identical-fee-*density* transactions, which would plausibly be contiguous under "customary" mempool preparation practice, and would thus look equally "ordinary" regardless of how you shuffle them)

If bitcoin needs saving by one person (even the founder) then it has failed.

Actually this is probably not attack-motivated: a better attack (for essentially the same cost) would be to emit lots of unprunable dust UTXOs, rather than prunable OP_RETURNs, thereby making validation (of all future incoming transactions against the UTXO-set) more costly for everyone from now on.
The OP_RETURNs presumably contain data the sender regards as valuable. As to why they don't just send one OP_RETURN with a hash of all the data... well... maybe they advertise to clients "we'll put your data into the blockchain for you to see", and they worry that a lot of their clients would get confused if they had to wade through a Merkle tree or suchlike to find their morsel of data...

Well, it's not something I want to campaign for myself, since I'm broadly happy with BIP148... but, I'm just pointing out that the opposite position (not necessarily disliking segwit per se, but feeling nervous about rushing it) *is* a legitimate one, and those feeling that way *could* protect themselves from re-org worries by that single-block-requirement UASF.
Whether they actually do any such thing, I suppose depends on that community's ability to think of such a measure (or read my comment, hehehe), and their ability to coordinate around it in the short remaining time.....

Ah, thank you!

Actually if there's a disliking-segwit-being-rushed-with-BIP148 community (even a small one), they can do their own UASF: it's enough for *their* UASF to say "the **first** block median-timed August 1st must be **non-**segwit-signalling".
Then, the two UASFs will be soft forks of previous-generally-prevailing-Bitcoin, but *hard forks of each other*. That is, each UASF regards the other UASF as invalid, and neither community can be re-orged by the other.
So then each community is free to turn out to be a majority or minority of any size, with no re-org worries. A peaceful split like that is hopefully no big deal. (like ETH and ETC)
