Everyone knows Steve Jobs is a Buddhist and would not be doing the things the Modern Apple Company is doing. 
Why not OpenApple, or use the Spanish Manzana?

It is a time paradox.

1994 was when dial-up BBS systems started to get into Internet access and started to become ISPs by buying an ISDN modem and adding PPP/SLIP support to their BBS login. Most of them got run out of basements.
People used IRC and Usenet as well as email, and the BBS software was modified to use those as well.
Going online meant dialing into a BBS system before the Internet became popular. 
Once the WWW came out people started to get on the Internet more.

The Bible is full of cryptocodes, the first cryptocurrency was used by the Knights Templar.

That would be like putting gas on a fire.
Printing up more dollars causes more debt and thus inflation. They have tricks to slow it down like indexing or China printing more money, but that only works for a while and then the debt becomes due and hits the fan.

In the USA they are trying to pass virtual currency laws. I think they want to ban the use of Bitcoin. 
There is a global economy collapse coming soon because of all the debt from spending money on wars in the Middle East. The Baby Boomers are retiring and taking money out of socialist systems to live on. Not enough people to work jobs to pay taxes to fund social programs. Too many disabled veterans not getting help.

Before Paypal people would postal mail money orders. A lot of the money orders were fake and printed on inkjet printers. By the time your bank rejected the money order the item was already shipped and the buyer did this to several people and used a PO Box as an address.
Paypal was developed to stop the online fraud and protect the buyers and sellers and send money via email from bank accounts and credit cards. But over the years it protects buyers and tries to screw the sellers.
I can tell you that I know many of my friends who run a small business that get defrauded by buyers on eBay and Paypal. Who eventually stopped selling on eBay and accepting Paypal.
I used to have a web page of Paypal alternatives on my website until I forgot to pay the bill and it got deleted. It is out of date and many of them got bought out by Paypal.

Thor faces Fenrir at Ragnarok not Odin. But otherwise apt.
I suppose Odin can take on the Wall Street Bear.

Ho ho ho if that were true, Microsoft would have been out of business a long time ago.
Started out with an unlicensed Dartmouth BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800, didn't pay a license fee to Dartmouth to use BASIC. Did the same things with COBOL and FORTRAN and other languages. People started to copy the Micro-Soft tapes because they had illegally used the languages without paying their license fees. Bill Gates called them Pirates, but in reality had pirated the languages and made big money off them. When they bought 86-DOS it was an illegal clone of CP/M with some commands moved into RAM and renamed. They called it DOS and had a program that converted CP/M programs into DOS programs. The PC Clones and MS-DOS put almost all CP/M companies out of business unless they switched to making PC Clones. DRI made CP/M and modified it to make it DR-DOS to run DOS programs, but Microsoft put code in Windows so if it detected DR-DOS it wouldn't run. 
I could go on about putting Netscape out of business by bundling Internet Explorer with Windows, or how the MS-Office Bundle put Wordperfect and Lotus almost out of business. About how Microsoft would just steal software ideas from any company and make their own version of it and anything they couldn't make they bought out like Hotmail, etc.
I could go on about the number of people Microsoft drove into suicide because they ruined their careers and companies. 
I could go into the DOJ findings of fact:
No doubt Microsoft will most likely make a rival to Paypal some day.

There is a certain cancer on Wikipedia that wants to destroy information and promote ignorance. The same thing has been done to Pre-Internet technology articles, they get nominated for deletion and every source cited is called not independent or from a non-notable source even if they are independent and notable.. Heck I was citing CNN articles only to be told it was a 'blog' site anyone can write for and is unreliable and non-notable. They will use any excuse and even make stuff up to get articles deleted.
It was but one of the reasons why I joined Uncyclopedia, as it was more reliable than Wikipedia at the time even if it was a humor wiki.

The EU is just the Forth Reich. Founded by former Nazi Youth Officers. What did you expect from Fascism?
