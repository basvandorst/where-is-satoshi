I don't think I understand the question. Now 24 hours later, the transaction (with fee) is still not taken into a block, it is 'unconfirmed'.
Why do I need it confirmed? Because I bought something, but the recipient is waiting for the transaction to confirm.
I wish there was some clarity what you can or should do now..

My transaction (wallet bitcoin core), with standard suggested fee is pending for 14 hours. How can I increase the fee or resend the transaction with a higher fee?

Great! Which branch of the blockchain?

[Monero]( has something you describe. Just click the 'Create an Account' button and instantly you have a wallet secured by an automatically generated private login key (write it down!).
Sure there is something similar for Bitcoin, there will be users below my post providing you with links ;)
Still I don't see the hassle in installing BreadWallet for example..

I am using MyFancyFacebook+
It is superior to Facebook, only downside is that nobody uses it.
TL;DR Network effect

Few options:
- Bitcoin price goes up
- Hash rate goes down
- Nothing much changes because existing miners already covered their hardware costs, so only the price of electricity and overhead are relevant factors
- All the above

Better use this subreddit, where we have free speech and no censorship.

Reading the comments @ Upwork makes me realize how much potential bitcoin still has. Great news!
It is astonishing how biased and hostile people are towards anything else than the dollar, *real* money.
Bonus points for the argument: "you only have a few forum posts so your opinion does not count" (freely translated).
