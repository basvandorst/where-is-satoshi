This is something like 6 Euros. This is nothing. I even would send you 10 $, but i dont want that anybody knows my bitcoin address, because then they track me down.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:47:49
Sell 2 Bitcoins, and you have 2000 $, and keep the rest.
Just dont think that they dont will fall.

@_date: 2014-02-19 16:50:08
HAHA oh my god.
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:23:55
Wat...Bitcoin is again on 500€...and i didnt buy....
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:36:47
Then they just click from where i got the coins, and then they see this.
Will this goes with the money i send away?
Also, i am a little bit scared to just transfer it to another account, maybe i will lose it.
What if i do it, and my pc gets out?
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:52:04
Exactly ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:18:50

@_date: 2014-07-22 23:08:30
Is this real? How fast could he get?
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:19:20
I did, and i still hold them. I have 1,5 Bitcoins, and if it goes down to 0$ then i have a little bit less money, if it goes up, i maybe sell it.
@_date: 2014-06-28 01:02:25
We dont need to ask them, whe could just do it.
@_date: 2014-06-03 21:01:01
Why does this stand there, and how i remove it?
@_date: 2017-01-16 12:32:15
Wow, thats not fair.
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:23:35
Thanks. Just had a hearth atack.
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:17:09
But the website says i don't have them in my wallet anymore, or am i just stupid?
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:19:31
Did just that, and nothing happend. So i gues its confirmed to be fake? 
I mean they have no support, and no way to proof if you send them anything, why wouldn't they scam you?
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:20:08
My wallet is not synched up yet.
@_date: 2016-11-16 00:45:23
Of course, my id is 543 563 828 and my pw is y915k[,]( so just do what you have to do, in the meanwhile i go to work. The password for my wallet is 43533455(943882) 
@_date: 2016-11-16 23:51:18
Well i did recieve money with paypal...
@_date: 2016-11-16 15:57:04
Your username really builds up trust. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 20:14:34
What? What does this mean, does this mean 0.5 bitcoins are now just gone?
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:52:05
Makes sense, this is what i did suspect so i didn't risk a larger amount.
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:48:48
I can't find anything about them on google or reddit, so how do i know its not a scam?
@_date: 2016-11-16 18:16:02
My god, please scam somewhere else.
@_date: 2016-10-30 17:30:13
Not sure about pirate party in iceland, but they only got worse in germany.
At the begining i would vote for them, but then they got to shit, and while they were full of nerds back in the day, now its full of leftist and sjws that know nothing about bitcoin, or the dark web, or anything.
They just know that nazis are bad and sexism is too. What a shame.

Where to get a small loan of 1 million bucks?

A pc turns 100% of the power into heat. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:51:39


Which in the end turns into heat.


Then have no lights in it.
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:15:35
I know someone who has this and they told me it is not worth it. I asked because i wanted to install a heat pump in my new house, but either way i will have no gas connection so i will heat with electric.
@_date: 2016-05-02 14:32:50
Movement will turn in the same room into heat, and maybe 0.1 % of energy gets lost because of other things.
@_date: 2016-05-02 09:33:59
I am interested to see where the rest energy is going from the computer which is not turned into heat?
@_date: 2016-05-01 22:10:44
But a Computer turns 100% of the energy into Heat, so nothing gets lost.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:09:18
Haha what a loser.
