They could trade monopoly money too, it just has no value, like their Zimbabwean bucks. 
Fear not about their technological shortcomings there are kindhearted micro-loan sharks like Carlos Slim, The Benevolent, that will rent seek them their phones(Which were bulk "bought" with government subsidies). They'll then get paid in Satoshis for menial work, to then pay off their phones, which Slim makes 10000% profit on the deal, and he never came out of pocket for it.
