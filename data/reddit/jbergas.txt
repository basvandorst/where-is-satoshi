now just imagine if you had gone backpacking in late october and then woke up to see the price where it was today?  what would you say?
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:46:35
i got approved to 100k withdrawal limit per day on gdax pretty easily........i have made several withdrawals to an online bank account with no problem
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:45:14
need more details, where did you sell on what exchange, where was the trade for us dollars generated, and what bank wont accept it?
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:15:58
bought two the other day at the doubled price, dont give a fuk, need them now!
@_date: 2019-07-14 00:11:30
Lol there will come a day when you realize what a stupid idea it was to “sink most of your money into bitcoin” and you will be glad you weren’t able to find the fastest way possible
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:21:20
Not quite sure, to be honest I’ve never sent bitcoin from ledger to Coinbase, only the opposite
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:08:09
not that quickly, assuming you are able to immediately send the coins from your ledger to coinbase (immediately send them after making the decision you want to sell), could be 15 minutes, could be a couple hours......  i would argue the fastest would be 15 minutes......
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:22:53
thats what im saying, fastest case scenario is 15 minutes, likely scenario is probably 2-3 hours.....i dunno, i aint selling anytime soon......so not that concerned
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:10:03
Eh, slow your roll
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:58:57
i dont really understand why you consider this some brilliant "plan", youre basically acting like trading your bitcoins for some "placeholder" is a better decision than trading your bitcoin for the best "real" placeholder we have, USD, why on earth would you think that trading for a stable coin is going to be better than trading for usd?, if bitcoin continues to climb youre screwed either way, this idea is dumb
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:38:06
nothing stops this train
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:26:48
alright well ill just wait for the test to complete....and then send the rest..  thanks guys
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:15:31
wish they would hurry the EFF up with it
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:11:13
really a pointless chart.........the dollar value of a satoshi is constantly changing......
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:16:41
i have sent two successful transfers to gdax in the past few weeks......each one took a day......i just wonder if it depends on what bank you use......the money isnt lost....
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:25:33
keep in mind new GDAX users have been having a LOT of trouble getting that particular account activated, ID verification seems to be the problem
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:10:18
man what i would give for the day it plunged from 5000 to 3000!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:02:38
strong hands swooping in!
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:14:37
ha I completed my final purchases at around the 13500 mark
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:39:56
I seriously doubt it is lost, I was worried about this happening to me, it will show up sooner rather than later 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:08:26
ok so bottomline is it may take a few hours, as opposed to my ripple exchanges which took a few minutes.  Ok thanks a lot.  patience!
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:58:23
3 more minutes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:39
EVERYONE SELL!!! BCH
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:48:52
oh hell, need more of that xanax for sure
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:43
ONLY A FOOL would buy at that price considering the spread
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:57:42
gotcha, good news
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:54:08
u mean live as in on gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:02:16
this is true i put about 10% of my bitcoin into alts over the weekend
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:59:54
first in, first out, yes, its taxable
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:10:21
would you recommend I just send the .3 bitcoin rather than waiting for the 0.01 test run?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:41:37
i posted a couple days ago asking if anyone had ever heard of a legitimate case of somebodys shit on coinbase literally disappearing / being stolen......nobody ever responded
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:49:18
go to the top right hand corner and click on accounts, then go to bitcoin account, ill bet the  transfer is in either history, holds, or transfers, and is probably pending, go digging around there and check it out, it isn't lost
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:02:28
not sure if we will get there!
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:46:59
i say by february, i truly believe christimas and new years will drive price over 20k
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:13:18
it broke 18k Monday, its back up, but maybe through the weekend it will break, or maybe in ten minutes! who knows?!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:07:40
WIRE THE MONEY! FUCK waiting for the limit!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:28:30
CHILL OUT DUDE, itll come back, assuming ur not a troll
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:30:26
no 16100
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:57:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:09:02
2:1 sell to buy orders so far!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:18:54
i think this will be my plan
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:41
time to wire more! too late! fuck!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:27:07
17662.5 vs 17662.0!
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:11:37
14 DAYS ago it cracked 12k for the first time!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:22:20
its like a drug! fuck!
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:01:12
I think that it is at the beginning, many people don't see it as an investment, rather they feel they are supporting a world changing technology.......ask yourself how many people do you know that own bitcoin?  probably only a few..
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:52:20
apparently they issued a warning suggesting it may not happen?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:15
Yes,  and YES!
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:22:48
DO NOT DO THIS, GBTC sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:24
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:08:06
reminds me of 13500 last saturday night!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:11:56
I had a similar issue a couple weeks ago, mine never said completed, it said pending, but obviously my bitcoin wallet in gdax didn't reflect it existing anymore.......im certain this will resolve itself, theyre obviously having issues right now, as usual, lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:18
LOL PLUNGING!........same level it was on friday! in fact all last week it barely cracked 17000! 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:22:16
like 19700 to 18200, thats a dip, 11400 to 8900 two weeks ago.......  following a surge to 19k from 16k in a couple hours, and then dropping to 15k was a dip......
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:16
LET THE WEAK HANDS SELL! STRONG HANDS SWOOP IN AND GET SOME CHEAP COINS!
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:29:30
I assume you did not keep the google authenticator key when you created your first authenticator?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:30:36
well it doesnt matter if they do, everyone who wants to sell now will want to sell then
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:23:53
well that would imply there are no buyers, so nothing would happen,,,?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:09
37 minutes!
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:52:01
well, we hit 18k on Monday for a minute too, 20k is the next big milestone, 
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:15:27
so many internet bullshitters on here, this technical analysis is all bullshittttttttttt
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:21:24
what will you say when it drops below 3000&gt;?
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:07:16
i think all the new money that came in last year will be gone below 5k, or mostly is gone now, close to it anyway
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:15:24
for the record i wasn't passive, no matter how you spin it, your plan was not well thought out even for a beginner on day one......
@_date: 2019-03-28 15:11:32
coinbase is fine, but nobody recommends leaving coins on any exchange if you can put them elsewhere (ledger, etc)
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:41:35
Hodling for 2.5 years now, this I guarantee
@_date: 2019-11-19 15:08:16
say that when it keeps edging down past 5 k........  tired of hearing all this BS, you buy and hodl and keep buying and hodling........are you going to buy more when it goes down to 5 k?  4k?  if so, then i might believe your conviction.....
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:27:12
now thats what im talking about, SAME HERE BOYEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:06:42
OK SON ARE YOU BUYING THE DIP?!
@_date: 2019-11-14 11:15:08
U mean 8500
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:05:14
This reminds me of the time I bought at 16,800 when ten minutes before coulda bought at 16,000..... eh, was it truly too late? :)
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:36:17
Sure did, hodl
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:15:04
i will bet against it
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:32:20
dont sell son
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:00:14
is it going to the moon or will it abort and land safely on earth?
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:59:32
Talk to the people that bought in for the first time at 19,978 and thought this would be a brilliant idea
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:36:09
I remember having many many heart attacks in 12/2017 over this same issue multiple times multiple coins, the heart attacks stop after about 50 transactions lol
@_date: 2019-10-05 00:06:37
Lol bullshit his cost basis is zero, he owes taxes as we speak
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:10:09
as far as the top 10 coins are concerned, nobody has any excuse why they can't put their stuff on a ledger.......it really is easy.......keep coins off the exchanges!  except for the weird ones that are hard to put on the ledger...  
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:22:28
I bought substantial amount over 17k, bought more when It dropped to 3300,
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:01:43
Nah, selling at any point is for weak hands
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:58:47
Lol how stupid, must be a 12 yo posting
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:17:58
agreed essentially
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:46:44
only two times to sell:  it will give you enough money to live forever without ever working (at least $10M worth), or you need the money to eat because you are starving, homeless, and no charities will give you food....
@_date: 2019-02-24 00:03:17
Need 41000
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:35:02
lol, definitely new to the game
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:05:40
somebody post the dave chappell cocaine memes please
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:50:14
lol the one thing you can be sure about.......any hunch that you have about the price, should not be taken seriously.....that is for sure
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:39:03
the only question, how much to buy and when
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:57:01
case in point, i know a dude (know him well) who apparently at one point had a ton of XRP on binance, work over 200k at some point, well he thought he was being smart by using falsified names, etc. because he was paranoid about giving away his information, well he also had some long complex password that has since forgotten, also has forgotten how to log onto the "fake" email address he made for that binance account, and apparently cant access his shit anymore, GET A LEDGER
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:28:14
sell all shitcoins!
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:04:09
dropped to 3520 son
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:13:11
i say for sure buy if it drops close to 2k, other than that i can't say buy now or not......i will definitely load up at 2k......
@_date: 2019-01-09 17:04:48
i have exactly what you want, send me your private keys! lol
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:37:06
SOLUTION: ALWAYS have some money on coinbase pro / GDAX, problem solved........zero fees.....
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:45:52
that's the amount the price is up in dollars
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:34:50
no, in theory it won't just update when you open it.......  if this is your impression of the ledger wallet you need to do a little bit more research about it.......  some people have firmware that is so outdated they cannot update it......maybe ledger device wont be supported at all in 5 years?  this is not the safe approach.....
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:42:51
i predict yes
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:06:56
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand its gone
@_date: 2019-01-11 19:32:07
god how many people are going to go down in flames after they skip out on several years of filing crypto taxes?  dude you CANNOT escape from this reality.......
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:37:37
make sure ledger firmware is updated, periodically make sure you actually have access to coinbase and it is functioning properly......, etc.
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:12:54
NEVER EVER SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:43:58
was it from an american bank?  If so, i bet there will be no problems......i never had any problems with it, I think i did a total of 3
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:39:53
i wanted to be able to trade sooner than 7 days, but ur right now its pretty clear what i SHOULD have done, LOL
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:42:11
just need &gt;10K!!!
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:09:51
100k per coin here we comeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:17:05
did several about six months back
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:20:43
i will never sell until i need the money to eat and i am starving homeless.....  LOL
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:43:34
I REMEMBER watching it at 19975 hoping it would do this to 20k! LOL
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:40:01
the same reason you dont listen to them when they criticized trump, they are completely fulla shit
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:31:20
lol, probably so, but i have an income so i wont ever get to that point ! hodl
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:42:26
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:26:36
60k will be the new 20k!.....trust me! lol
@_date: 2018-07-24 12:34:39
alright dude, i see you just HAVE to be abrasive for absolutely no reason at all, even when the other person was simply agreeing with your original post and subsequent posts, etc.  carry on
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:21:17
was waiting for a bank deposit to get to coinbase this afternoon! this is me! lol
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:03:10
to be able to do that requires neither that you are born rich, or had connections....
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:20:59
haters gonna hate and criers gonna cry
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:16:06

@_date: 2018-04-03 19:06:13
yuh, u right
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:05:48
Coins are gone
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:30:28

@_date: 2019-05-12 11:47:39
Coinbase pro, zero fees
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:49:49
lol hilarious, but this post goes a step beyond the usual stupid
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:48:16
10k is the new 1000, 200k by December
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:27:55
200k by december
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:00:08
been there many times bro, been there
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:47:51
i guess so long as you never actually WRITE DOWN a coin address, you should virtually never come across this problem?
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:14:19
there are zero fees if you deposit money into coinbase pro and buy on a limit order....
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:05:42
lol DO NOT mention forked bitcoins around here!
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:12:32
 i will say this, 100% of the time i was in a rush to buy, it was always a mistake (ie bought high, lol)
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:48:56
Do u even Coinbase pro? No fees
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:01:25
even more insane was the fast jump from 10-20k, that happened in like a week or two, THAT WAS INSANE
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:59:16
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:33:52
im not buying anymore until we get to close to 2k, IF that happens; however if ethereum drops to close to 80 again ill buy more of that....
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:26:35
i want one every 30 seconds lol, i want it verbalized as well, LOL
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:46:01
u dont lose until you sell, hodl
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:59:04
bad bad bad advice
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:39:08
i have strong doubts about this
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:07:52
lol, no
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:55:53
lol say it to my face son, youre just mad ive done a shitload of transactions with them for zero fees, and never had any problems either, so stfu
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:48:59
coinbase is actually an excellent service, people simply need to learn to send to pro.coinbase, buy with zero fees, send with zero fees, wtf else you want?  
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:51:58
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:54:07
there were people who got in two cycles before 2017, that sold everything at $1000 that i know personally, at the beginning of 2017, because they were convinced it wouldnt go any higher, less than a year later it hits 20k.......to me there is 0% chance it doesnt go back up to that and past it....just my feeling
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:25:38
price alert! automatic buy orders! problem solved! lol
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:38:32
i dont think the post is bull assuming the person bought ONLY in august and not in the latter months of 2017
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:08:52
dawg, make a bank deposit, send to pro.coinbase, buy on limit, ZERO FEES, for god sake
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:38:37
i agree, i am getting greedy and i want some cheap ass coins, that being said, i will be down a large amount by then, hodl!
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:53:07
# LOSE, not loose
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:01:05
doesnt sound like you learned anything!
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:23:01
i really am not sure how it is people suggest that it will take 5 entire years to recover from a classic bitcoin 80% plunge, it never took that long before
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:31:41
19975, i watched it for an hour sit there just praying to break 20k...........oh hell
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:56:39
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:40:56
i think mine is close to that, HODL
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:15:20
i think 2k will be the bottom, AT WHICH POINT i will buy much more
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:11:05
Most of those peeps prolly did in 2017
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:39:06
huge error in judgment
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:40:02
i predict today will go down in history as "black friday" and be some big market crash
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:39:06
when everyone thinks they will be poor, buy, when everyone thinks they will have a lambo, sell
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:47:25
whoa, i didnt actually know addresses were case sensitive....i always copy and paste, but damn.....good to know
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:47:51
coinbase, do a bank deposit (free), transfer to pro.coinbase, and buy with limit order, zero fees
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:02:43
well guess what bro, my shit is on the ledger, coinbase doesnt hold my coin, u hurd me
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:46:58
sure, i may be in a rush to buy when it happens, but i can buy immediately on coinbase, but just bc im in a rush doesnt meant i was RIGHT to be in a rush
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:21:53
1.  Get coinbase pro / coinbase account
2. Buy Ledger nano S or ledger nano X, learn to use it, set it up..
3. Buy bitcoin with bank deposit on limit in coinbase pro(no fees)
4. Transfer bitcoin from coinbase pro to ledger (no fees).
5. Hodl, but keep software updated on your hardware wallet
