They specifically state that they don’t accept BPAY from a credit card. I didn’t read that until after I’d already made the BPAY payment ��

Iran has the net and they’re a fairly affluent society overall but of course their are echelons and corruption and big gaps between rich and poor, just like the USA and most other places. They’re in a political and global financial hostage situation because they refused to bow down to threats from the US in the70s. They refuse to play the US monopoly game so their economy becomes a target for ‘pressure’ from the US and allies. Hence their affinity for Russia as the only major player willing to risk the wrath of the US by dealing with them.

I beg to differ - I believe the US Govt consistently fucks over their people with their monetary policies

Lol don’t worry you will be VERY glad you HODLed ... I was the same when I first bought, many sleepless nights refreshing coinmarketcap XD ... months later I’m in serious profit and not planning on selling any time soon.  I think 5 is an ideal minimum number :-)

gambling on sports is idiocy
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:35:00
Rubbish. Every regular gambler I’ve ever met is down over all. The problem is most of them just don’t honestly describe their losses. They kid themselves that some of the losses don’t count and they block them out of memory. They always remember the $500 win but forget to mention the thousands they lost b fore it. It’s self delusion. If you treat investing like gambling and expect an illogical win instead of holding, you’ll lose on that too. Investment takes patience and research. Over the long term those who’ll hold their shares (or crypto) outperform those who sell after holding for a short time.

ANZ allows POLi... what I’m trying to find out is how to add more than one bank account to my POLi / Cointree
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:58:09
I had doubts to start with but never had any problems with it
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:20:03
Thanks. I don’t want to replace one bank account with another, I want to link 2 bank accounts, so that I can choose whichever one I wish to make the POLi payment from. Are you saying that I can have only 1 linked bank account? My CBA bank account is already linked, but wanted to also link my ANZ account? Is that possible?

Business Bermuda’s- the red looks more official. Doesn’t remind me so much of the high school teachers khakis with sandals and long white socks, which conversely look highly unprofessional.

That’s about the most sensible rebuttal I’ve heard yet to these comments. Thank you for putting this context around it.
