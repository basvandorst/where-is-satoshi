mainly it's language problem but , in georgia banks do know about it and they are charging us with extra $-s when we buy bitcoins from here 
and those charges are not small amount , i hate banks :(

i like your points , changetip has good new member as you   , you know what and how to do , keep it going , good luck to you   20 share the love
also helping artists is good idea , there are too many Good Music producers in my country and they just don't have patrons , yep they are continuing theyr job but imagine if they have more money to do more things , it will make them independent from patrons 
my friends are painters , they have quite good paintings but guess what ? you already know the answer "they don't have a patron "   community is fast growing and majority realizes that it could be life changer for this world ,
