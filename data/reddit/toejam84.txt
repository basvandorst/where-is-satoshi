Looks fine here, I doubt a short downtime on the site will affect prices that much. Prices are still holding strong in the low-mid 140's.

Great article, will refer my friends to it that are interested in learning more about Bitcoins.

Yeah, explains why people can't simply arb the prices from one exchange on another when there is a difference in prices.

Things are only worth what others are willing to pay for them. Bitcoin has a large enough (and growing) following that as they become more scarce their value will continue to increase. If there were thousands of collectors of your rainbow coloured turds I'm sure you'd fetch quite a bit for them too :D

Agree totally - VBV is extremely annoying, and since not every site uses it by the time you do come across one that does it's very hard to remember the damn password.

Well said! The article has gotten a lot more coverage than it deserved.

 &gt; This nearly anonymous currency fuels more than $1.2 million in sales of contraband items, including guns and drugs online
A single briefcase full of actual cash in an unlawful transaction would contain a lot more money than that. Fight the crime not the currency.

The news seemed fishy to me too. 
But even if they wanted to make using bitcoin illegal, how do you stop it when it can be spent anonymously?

I wonder how many people would actually answer yes to that question though. Unless they had some type of spell on them like Jim Carey in Liar Liar and had to tell the truth.

Lol cool link, I guess I've watched too many movies hahah :)

Fun way to generate some extra coins. Shame nobody at my work uses bitcoins. They'd prob just nick them anyway though hahah

Congrats on the investment, wish I could go back in time and invest all my money in bitcoins while they were still just $14!
If I was you and I had my life savings tied up I probably would have cashed out as soon as I'd seen the investment double or triple in value (and end up kicking myself later) but props to you man, well done.
