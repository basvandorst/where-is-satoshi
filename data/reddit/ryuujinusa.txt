Chinese are dumping their gains a little late. Prices sucked to begin with...
Shoulda sold in December...

I’m worried my bank will pull a fast one, as ill be needing to sell some coin in a month here to pay stuff off...
They however are a smaller, not as big as chase bank that can’t afford to toss away customers, I think... so hopefully things don’t change.
I think it’s probably a combination of the massive influx of new bitcoin owners, problems with bank wires etc, Coinbase being WAAAAAY understaffed and banks just not wanting to deal with it.
If there’s anything that makes people go crazy and lose any sense of dignity, it’s money...

Oh, cool. i live in Japan and have been using it for months, but I didn't know theyre outside of Japan now too.

Fees are non-existent more or less atm
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:47:55
Yep, “spend 3k dollars and get X” kinda thing.
Sure, ok, buy 3k worth of bitcoin, wait a month for profit, sell, collect X, win win!
Now, of course that 3k of bitcoin could become 2k overnight, so it’s not *that* easy
I use the visa amazon card by chase, however I’ve heard bad things about chase and bitcoin so who knows how long that’ll last
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:08:59
That even available outside of Japan?

I knew this was coming. I didn’t want it to, but I saw it a mile away.
Weekend warriors buying some btc before Monday, and then the wall street snakes ate it right up.

Try sending $1000 to someone. Let me know how that works out...
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:17:30
This is inflation, not value... 
Two entirely different things...  It's like comparing the number of Bitcoin sold in December to the number of Bananas sold in December...

Huh? Where are you seeing 10,500? I see 11,776

I sent btc today for nothing. Granted, it wasn’t 10 btc or anything, but still. The fee was 0.

Wish I had the money. I fucking bought the DAY before the dip... I'm like, hey, prices arent kinda low, it'll go up soon, right!? No.
If the dip stays for another week or so I will buy again though.

They probably weren't as honest as they should have been. But hey, I don't leave my money on CB so if the Feds or someone else cracks down on them or someone hacks them, I'm fine with that too.

Not touching that pile of shit and I’m hodling to the grave with my btc, ltc and eth 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:18:18
Who is even selling for these shit prices?
I mean, I’m still way in the black, but honestly? 14k!?! Hah!!!!  
I bought a small bit today, when it was around 15k, but that’s cause I thought 14k was like, no mans land.... who would even bother selling for such a shitty price, when just last weekend we saw 19!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:16:57
Welcome to the club. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:45:05
My dad sent me a message too. Not off as far as you MIL but he just a random news link about it crashing. Told him I bought in way before 15k and then it dipped to 11 and I said again, still good...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:41:42
Before CME or after I wonder...
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:34:50
It will be a nice Christmas present, but I certainly don't have enough in yet for a surge like that.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:14:58
Yeah, there is another Japanese exchange, forget what it's called but I only use BF. I also use Coinbase though, as an expat I have a US bank account too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:23:51
Hodl to the grave!
Well not really, but I def ain’t selling now
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:58:22
That's a shitload of alts, dont know how far down the totem pole I really want to go... probably not that far. But hey, I got lucky with monacoin on bf, lol it's been sagging a little recently but I got some at 3 bucks each.

What’s the best free wallet?
Currently using Bread for iOS, would you advise against this?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:12
I wouldn't be surprised if it goes a little below 10k, but it's more than just the "wallstreet" traders pumping it before the dump at this point, a lot of normal people got in too. The BCH pump and dump was a full blown attack and all they got was 30% at MOST. Now, 30% isn't a small number, but 30% of 15k is 5-ish. We're at 16 now... so down to 10k seems reasonable. Could be 20k in a few days, so that would turn into a 50% drop. MASSIVE, but still 10k
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:36
And Coinbase is down
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:19
Same thing they did in November, pump and dump
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:35:29
OR it could just do nothing...
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:38:20
Japan has to "approve" of exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:23:10
Don’t sell.
I’m seriously still in shock at anyone selling under 15k
Like, why!? We were at 19k less than a week ago!
Why take such a lower price!?
And whale schmale, it’s not them 
I’m gonna try and buy at the end of this dip, that hopefully ends soon
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:19:01

It’s a bcash pump and dump 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:07:50
I wish I had the money to buy when it dipped hard to 11k, I mean, I kinda did, but I didn’t.
Oh well.
Been mining too so that’ll help
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:15
I don’t think Coinbase is out to scam with bch, I’m ok with them adding it, I just sick of the pumping and dumping.
I’ll probably never buy that shit coin, cause of the shitty people behind it but yah, lots of other exchanges support it and Coinbase is a company out to make a profit, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with them adding it as long as they’re being honest with it
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:26:29
Most likely and I’ll be laughing

Back to over 7k please
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:08:17
Yeah, next year when your .037 btc is worth 400 pounds, you'll be thinking you did well. That fee is a bit steep imo though. Where did you buy?

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:26:07
They’ve been seeing millions all week. This seems like people going to bch. All other alts excluding bch are down too 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:46:10
I think anything in the 7k range is fine. Even touching 6900. Anything lower, I’m worried some noobs will panic. 
Everyone whines about dips to buy, well, here it is.
The 100-200 usd fluctuations are normal and can be ignored. This is bigger, but I think perhaps people trying to buy the dip will cause it to not be so huge.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:37:12

@_date: 2017-11-30 07:18:17
VPN for Coinbase to set it up.
Should work after that without (I’m also in japan doing like you did)
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:31:53
I really hope so, if not sooner.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:48:05
Move it to a wallet and find an australian exchange. 
I’m not Aussie so I don’t know any, but I’m sure you can find some. Perhaps ask your friend?
P.S. I think you’ll find yourself buying much more anyways ;)
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:16:02
Pretty sure you can’t regulate btc, that’s the whole point lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:30:41
A lot of people bought under that price, myself included. I’m however still hodling
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:44:03
A biggen decided he needed a new car I suppose
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:32:36
I don’t have 1000s invested, so I’d prefer an easy to use, but safe wallet with minimal fees.
The hardware wallets are a tad expensive. If I had a lot more in, I wouldn’t think twice about it 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:35:27
Everyone will tell you not to hodl on Coinbase.
I’m not sure if private wallets, not exchanges, duplicate for forks either though.
Looking for an answer too.

I’ve seen that too. Definitely wrong
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:49:23
I concur, I live in Japan and am very surprised. I bet most people still have no idea what bitcoin is here and yet theyre taking these steps. Again, a very unjapanese thing to do, they're pretty slow at doing pretty much everything here.
nonetheless, I'm still happy it happened. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:46:32
That's nothing, just some whales skimming some profits.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:22:32
That’s almost as bad as the Nigerian prince who needs a loan scams. 
I’m sorry, but this guy must have been living under a rock for the past 20 years -.-

Prices will sink and this is the dip everyone was waiting for.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:44:45
Boooo, they’d be stupid if they dropped it that low
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:13:05
Don’t sell. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:27:23
Oh they did, it’ll rebound, that surge up was just too nuts.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:01:31
Shrug, it’s no dip like we had last week but it was close to $500. And the weekend just started
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:37:45

Bch is simply a pump and dump. Just like the fuckers did to btc, they’re gonna try and rob everyone on bch too.
If people can’t see it after being fooled once, they’re retarded and deserve to get robbed
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:01:55
Can’t wait till they get robbed. It’s a bad thing to say, I know,  but it JUST happened to btc. It’s written all over the walls, it couldn’t be more obvious 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:39:40
I don’t recommend this idea. I mean, it’s probably safer than goin to Vegas and putting it all on black, buuut bitcoin is volatile as hell
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:29:24

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:47:23
Not really. Lots of people are very interested in keeping the price high and the coin valuable. It would cost a lot to come in and wreck it. It’s not going away, it’s been around for what, 9 years, and minus a few ‘incidents’ has only gotten stronger. It’s over the hump, but still volatile to an extent.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:39:14
I figured it would go up till the CME launch. I guess not
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:07:42
Lol, I dunno about that... long as it doesn’t collapse I guess. I’d take something a little slower
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:40:27
Certainly dropping like a rock... wonder why they’d do it BEFORE the fork? Doesn’t make much sense 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:45:42
It’s a pump and dump. They’re gonna rob you again like they robbed you with btc. Why the fuck wouldn’t they
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:51:13
Fuck Forbes and their anti-adblock. Anyone have a copy of the article?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:17:36
And people are tanking it back down, selling for shit prices. I can understand some people selling at 7600, but they've tanked it back to less than 7200 now. 7600 is there, why sell for these trash prices.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:43:57
No. 
People like you are the reason it’s dropping.
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:26:52
It’ll dip, but all everyone has to do is hodl. All will be fine, just repeat after me: HODL
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:10:30
From 10,000 to 1,000!? That’s a crazy speculation. So many people are invested at far higher prices, I just can’t see it “popping” like many say. 
Will there be dips? Sure. 
Will the growth slow? Probably.
Will it tank to 1k? Unlikely 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:51:36
A little harder for us late investors. If you got in at like sub 1k, yah, you made crazy unreal profit. Everyone post 5k still has a ways to go
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:17:01
This happened yesterday too, or was suuuper close. 
Wonder why people keep pulling it down. It hit 7600 at one point, then soon as it gets a little energy people drag it back to 7200 or 7000 even.
What happened to the moon!!!??!
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:34:05
It’s a shot in the dark but 7200? Everyone liked that price before the shitcoin whose name I won’t say tried to attack btc.
I also predict 8k before December at the earliest and mid December at the latest.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:08:18
And it’s dipping hard. 
Why sell? The fork!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:27:50
My Coinbase purchases are instant. Maybe he didn’t verify enough 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:44:32
8k was close, it hit 7600 the other day and people tanked it back to 7k.
I boil it down to simple impatience 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:02:02
Coinbase seems reasonable but you don’t have the keys to the wallet so they *could* take your money. Will they? Seems unlikely but you need a real wallet with real keys if youre gonna invest seriously
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:58:38
Btc is tanking HARD! Time to buy
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:06:45
I thought about it a little and I think a lot of people want to be back in the glorious +7k range so yah, I think we’ll see 7k soon 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:07:19
It’s not
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:41:50
A pretty ridiculous dip, like close to 1k already 
To buy low?

Dunno? you're new to CB then?
Did you verify your address etc, and the other stuff they ask for in the account menu? I mean, even when I first made my cb account it was instant... Maybe things have slowed down with the influx of cb users this past month
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:48:10
hey man, it's your money, so do what you want with it, but just know that I, a random stranger on the interwebs, doesn't recommend it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:11:59
you forgot one more thing. Hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:01:52
I read it didn’t even get off the ground 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:04:58
You’re not actually mining btc on NH. If you didn’t already know, and for those that don’t, you mine the most profitable alt and are simply paid in btc
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:54:02
That price would be wild, just have my doubts
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:54:46
How much did bch crash from the pump and dump that just happened? WELL over 29% closer to 50%. People are gullible. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:16:17
I have gdax running on my 2nd monitor and work PC (when I’m not using it) pretty much nonstop. 
I’ve been addicted since I bought my first (fraction) of a btc
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:19:11
The dump happened, its sub 7200 levels now.

I don’t think that was panic. People with lots of coin wanted to cash in
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:46:46
Most vpns are banned, and china is actively banning them. 
Sure, they’ll never win, but like I said, it’s a pain in the ass.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:26:38
Waaaay below that now
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:44:19
We have one tiny run and everyone gets their space suits on and starts googling the local lambo dealer. Calm down. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:56:58
Dunno about that just yet. We don't want crazy spikes, like we saw in bch, all those are, is pump and dumps and whales getting fatter. Let them take their money to the shit alt and stay there. good riddance
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:03:03
Yeah, that lambo was from the omaze giveaway. He definitely wasn't given that.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:00:11
It’s crazy as hell, that’s just the most recent trend
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:09:31
[Tokyo now]( 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:07:33
I saw the google news, don’t know why that would start a dip like this...
Good riddance to the scammers I say, not going to panic sell or anything, just wondering...
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:33:48
Crack down on something that can’t be regulated? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:36:25
I don’t have a clue. Just like everyone else. Random ass speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:24:27
signed. But I have a sneaky suspicion CB is in on the scam too.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:41:05
Sorry, this is the US app store. I don't think it's available anywhere but the US currently.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:39:25
Yeah, I did. They may allow transfers IN but out doesn’t seem possible.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:38:03
Give me one day of $1000 or something then a bull run to Neptune 
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:17:34
Dusting off my 10k memes already
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:09:47
Dude is a criminal! All he did was lie cheat and steal from people to get rich. 
Don’t let the movie make him look like a nice guy, cause he ain’t.
If he didn’t get caught he SURE as hell would still be lying and cheating and stealing.
He’s clearly trying to get rich some how here, perhaps by buying bearish crypto futures? I dunno, but he sure as hell ain’t saying this cause he’s a “nice guy” and likes millennials...  THAT is hogwash.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:16:32
Wow. Well that makes them useless.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:55:22
Wait at least a full month before you even LOOK at the price again. Checking everyday will just stress you the fuck out. Then slowly check less and less after that
Grats on buying the dip tho
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:12:42
Very strange, but I think it’s still the bitfinex madness. Their loss, not mine
HODL strong!
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:58:40
Not exactly, your $50 worth will be progressively less btc and while you may have spent close to 50 grand USD (at that rate), you may not have sweet profits if you dumped 10% of your savings (you are willing to lose) into it NOW.
@_date: 2018-02-24 12:31:57
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:25:41
I think it will, in a good way.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:33:32
Day late and a dollar short. I’ll be moving my coin off there when they do though... time for a real wallet (non iOS one)
whats up with the downvotes fucknuts...
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:43:49
What miner?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:19:35
I’m fine with this. Good rid of the weak hands, more lambos (or civics) for me
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:46:14
Doesn't that mean you should be selling now?
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:58:17
How can they regulate btc? That’s the whole point of btc.
Cashing back from crypto to USD (fiat), sure, perhaps, anything else, no.
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:00:59
He’s what we call here on Reddit a karma whore (aka a liar) who makes shit up for karma. 
Downvotes for him 
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:57:23
Ok, thank you. I will move it over then
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:47:20
I think i've seen this like 30 times. We got it, SK aint gonna ban crypto... ffs 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:47:24
Welcome, should got it, what, a few days ago when it was 5400.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:56:50
Don’t check Reddit daily, or sometimes weekly. Recent dip so I thought I’d take a peek. Prices is random, alerts on my phone went off
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:58:37
The cryptoruble will crash and burn. They’ll cave and eventually allow bc
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:35:29
Agree. Please send out emails to those you are revealing...
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:15:10
I'm also a super noob, let's say I have all my (very little) BC on coinbase, should I need to worry about anything? Can I just keep it in there?
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:58:56
Near 50% profit. Well done
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:57:54
When and if things catch on in Japan they blowup (here) everyone likes being like everyone else and I think if bitcoin was made easy to get and use here it would blow up. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:36:51
It appears not now
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:00:41
As mentioned before, it's not all that commonly known yet. I bet most people have just heard of it before but don't know much else. However this posting of signs in Japanese malls is a great sign (no pun intended). To the moon!
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:54:32
Maaaaan do I hate myself for not getting it when I heard about it then. Siiigh. Oh well, I’m in now, for considerably less.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:08:48
I live in Japan and have never noticed this. Where was this taken?
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:37:03
I had an alert on Coinbase for it. After that last run, I deleted said alert. 
I’m already in though
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:13:07
Ah, Tokyo eh. Makes sense I guess. I do not live in Tokyo. Japan is going hard it BC and CC so I think thisll start popping up more. The thing is, I bet most people here don't even know what BC is yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:31:10
Which wallet do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:04:07
So bread is secure then? How are the fees?
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:11:37
Really? You can’t move it to a private wallet??
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:18:35
Fuck btrash and Ver
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:35:59
Been to HK and mainland too, yep non-censored. 
We got a like portable data wifi thing to connect our phones and PC to specifically from HK is use uncensored internet while in China, which you easily can do, if you’re not Chinese. HK networks work in china, but I assume only non-Chinese can use them.

Remindme! 364 days
@_date: 2017-10-31 09:48:49
Right, all the fees I’ve incurred have pretty much been erased with profit. I suppose I could have had no fees to begin with but I’m still a bit leery to link my bank account.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:02:10
I think Musk said he’s not really down with crypto iirc. Correct me if I’m wrong 
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:01:30
This. That doc was nuts.

Don’t use amazon guys.

And it's not Fox News, that's the shocker. Fuck NBC too!
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:15:08
Bitcoin is not a company, nor do they don’t make or sell anything. Terrible comparison.
Apples to baseballs kinda level... they’re both round... end comparison 
@_date: 2018-04-20 20:53:46
On Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:17:48
Can’t use CCs anymore. Or for a while now.
