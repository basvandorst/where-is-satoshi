You have to know your age group. Most of us are millennials that weren't rich enough to move in at 17 because we were just too young. Even now metals are flat despite global financial and geopolitical risks.
But 17 to 44 is way different than $3 BTC to $20,000.

Different subs. Trying to warn people.
The only way to get completely away from true enslavement and control is physical metals. Unfortunately, you're not going to be buying stuff in a global system with metal that is in your hand.
Globalism and physical metal do not work very well together.
Crypto has so many benefits to fiat but not everyone is a cybersecurity expert, and they don't understand how vulnerable everything digital truly is.

It used to be backed by gold and minted in metal.

@_date: 2017-12-29 01:26:08
Yup, this is exactly how everyone feels now.
I have about $30,000 in metals. I think there is a place for them and certainly a way to get another NWO/Central bank crap, but the price just stays flat. I'll be moving into crypto soon, and I'll keep my stack.
Gains! Gains! **Gotta out race inflation!**
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:46:49
Gold and crypto can work together. 
Crypto lovers buy some gold, so when the network goes down or your exchange gets attacked by the us government you aren’t  f’d.
Gold bugs buy crypto, so you can move about the world and get exposure to gains.
Stop fighting - you’re on the same side!!! Everyone hates the bankers and everyone hates the fed.
Work to mother fucking together!
You’re both right and both wrong. Don’t over expose yourself to these classes.

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:51:10
But do people like that have the equipment and skill set to even buy crypto? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:15:44
lol, no they won't. 
Gold/Silver people have many things in common with Bitcoin, but anything than can be tracked is strongly against what gold/silver lovers stand for. I think both are on the same team.
What I was hinting towards are bankers and infinite money targeting BTC/Crypto using future contracts and other means to kick the price around or suppress it.  Satan worshiping bankers cannot and will not stand for a free world. 
They have suppressed and controlled gold/silver for years now. So much so that Shanghai exchange was created to combat the London price fixing.
When they show up in force ... not necessarily by futures alone. You'll know it. Prices will tank and never go up again not matter how much demand and how little supply is around. 
*Good news is BTC is different than the COMEX in many ways, so it's a tad more resistant to their attacks.*
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:02:38

@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:58
Central banks own gold. Big banks steal gold.
Gold/silver are used for medical equipment and supposedly silver has some special properties for healing that’s why all Food eating stuff and cups were made of silver. Think silverware.
Gold is used by nations to settle major debt think of payment for wars, etc.
No one wants fiat for anything really.
Gold is used in good electronics, and I’m sure it’s used in some heavy duty military equipment, too. Maybe, lasers?
Gold cannot be destroyed ever. It can be flattened, bent, molded, and melted to about any shape and size.
Tons of other stuff I’m not remembering, too.
I’d think it would have some special nano tech use in the future, too.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:26:05

Shorting has not stopped, yet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:42
Maybe ...
Or buy metals so you don't get enslaved.
Or have metals so when you say no and get gutted from the crypto world you can trade.
But I guess by that put they could just kill if or find you when you say no to something.
*I'm a conflicted mess*
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:51:20
All they had to do was put bankers in jail.
*Instead they gave them trillions.*

People are selling to make gains. Metal has been rigged so long and done nothing for years.
People are tired of the bankers; they always win.
I own my metals and will not sell at a loss. I’ll be damned if the bankers win. 
Many, many people are turning on mining and metals.

There will be no independence as long as you are tracked via technology. Securing the technology only makes fighting back / hiding that much harder.
