5th wave...sexy terminator machines.

Agreed. Industrial scale cryptocurrency mining is 5 years old at the most. This is brand new technology. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:25:27
You drive a BMW? That explains a lot. 
Process engineering is all about maximising energy utility. Anyone with a mining rig has quickly learnt they don't need to use the dryer as much - just stick clothes on a rack in the same room as the GPU's, and everything will be dry by the time you're back from work. Your home heating is paying for itself. 
Now apply that on an industrial scale. What other applications need a lot of low-grade (below 50C) heat? 
Edit: grammar.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:18:42
No I live in house where one of the heaters pays for itself and then some. What's the change in efficiency when replacing a 2kw fan heater with a 2kw miner? One makes heat, the other makes cryptocurrency and heat. Take that, scale up. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:06:06
Exactly. Home and commercial space heating, crop heating, heat for drying things, hot water heating.... there's a lot of uses for that energy that is currently just being vented back out into the atmosphere. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:47:32
Take waste heat, use it for something. Not that hard really. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:30:29
It has been done. 
What? You think I'd be an ardent advocate without an industrial scale proof of concept? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:42:30
Still early days yet. There are a lot of folks in your position who would be millionaires now if they held onto it for a few more years. Think of it as your first investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:52:56
Of course not. Fits snugly into the existing regulatory framework in most developed nations. The hard part is explaining it to anyone over 50 without a technical background. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:41:47
Zero reason might be pushing it too far, but portability, relative ease of transfer and simplier security make it attractive.
Also, gotta diversify dat portfolio - having some of your capital invested in precious metal, some in crypto, some in fiat currency and some in Lambos, and some in your zombiepocalypse shelter will be a legitimate strategy for some people. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 20:09:16
This. Plenty more can be done with all the heat generated by mining. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:26:19
My apologies, by invest I meant "have some as a semi liquid asset". I can't think of any crypto-exclusive investment vehicle where everything is done in cryptocurrency. The closest could be buying mining rig gear with Bitcoin  (if your local computer shop guy is interested), but apart from that it's be cash out to fiat first.

I bought my first scraps the day before the Mr Gox short. Ain't mad. In for the long term, and if I lose it, I can afford to do so. A bit more fun for me than pure gambling. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 01:32:37
Yeah, and Mt Gox didn't short the market either.  
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:54:16
Might happen one day, but for the moment we'll all still be paying for Big Mac's in local currency. Cross-border trade dealing with high value items is I think going to be one of the areas where cryptocurrency will ultimately find it's niche. Once rare-earths start getting traded in Bitcoin on a large scale, then we'll see things go nuts. Something will replace the petrodollar. Might as well be Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:31:29
Nah, just don't do something stupid like trust bag throwers with $300m of anything. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:17:12
Another good one: Given the choice between Bitcoin and gold, which would you prefer? Oil? Diamonds? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 09:56:03
I think it's fair to say energy is being wasted. That's not to say what is produced isn't valuable, but that more value could be extracted from the heat generated by mining. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:02:55
So much this. That is the true long term value of cryptocurrency: Reducing the financial infrastructure costs of international trade. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:55:48
They can still have physical control over what goes in and out of ports, but their fiscal controls will be diminished. Which may actually help avert future financial crisis created by greed. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:30:55
Pretty sure becoming bought and paid for bitches of Putin has done more harm, but whatever. I will not morn the loss of the USD's primacy. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:05:17
The Bay of Pigs was a failure. Putin's infiltration of the GOP has been an overwhelming success. I didn't say it was a success of the American intelligence community did I?  
@_date: 2018-07-21 06:15:19
That won't happen unless cryptocurrency can become as fast and efficient or better than cash or current eftpos systems. If it does, then yes. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:23:16
There is plenty of evidence, and it is evidence of the single greatest intelligence operation of all time! I don't like the guy's internal politics, but he has used his skill set to bring about the effective destruction of American Hegemony, and given Russia's relative weakness, I can't help but have respect for what he's done. 
The sovereignty of the United States has been completely infiltrated and corrupted by Russia. America's allies know it. America's enemies know it. And the actions of the toddler-in-chief reinforce it.  
Edit: Final line
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:51:20
Can I let you in on a secret? It's not really a secret, but too few people have actually taken notice of it: The population of Russia is only 145 Million. Take away nukes and oil and what have they got that Bangladesh, Nigeria, Pakistan, Brazil and Indonesia don't? Russia is a relic. It is stuck at midnight, 1991. I have quite a few Russian friends, and I would like to see it do well, but in the big scheme of things, it is not the fearsome spectre it once was. 
The capitulation of half of America's political class to a has been state who's only real asset is a bold leader says more about America than it does Russia. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:22:35
Oh my sweet summer child. Putin is an ex-KGB colonel. He has probably pulled the trigger on more Americans than your average metropolitan police officer. As horrific as the US intelligence community may be, they are still civil servants with what they believe is the American people's  best interests at heart. 
Likewise, while prone to a bit of Kleptocracy, Putin is doing what he believes is in Russia's best interests, and is using his skill sets to achieve this goal.
Trump is using his skill set as a con artist to amass as much material wealth as he can. Even now.
