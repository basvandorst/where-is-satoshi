I created another wallet on blockchain info wallet and it works fine though. I put my 12 word seed in electrum to restore the wallet there but its been synchronising for 5 minutes. If that works does that mean I can access my coins on my blockchain info wallet ( if it works again ) and on electrum at the same time?

OK does this mean I can access coins on both wallets or does this make all my coins go to electrum?

I restored it on electruma nd the balance is there but I try send out of electrum and I get this
 - 'The server returned an error when broadcasting the transaction.
Consider trying to connect to a different server, or updating Electrum.
Unknown error '
So does this mean blockchain infos server has an issue I don't understand or is it the actual blockchain?

Great news used a server from electrum org and I was able to move coin. So it must be an issue with blockchain info wallet.
So is there a way to secure these coins with a private key? so I own them

Yes I updated from the official electrum site
I will try some servers tonight thanks for your help.
I am wondering if its an issue on the blockchain as sometimes on my blockchain info wallet its shows my balance ( Most of the time it just says zero balance ) but even then when I try send it says insufficient balance. And on the blockchain info app on my phone it says ' we are experiencing a service issue that may affect displayed balance. don't worry your funds are safe ' now in the past it has said this but within an hour it is fine. It has been over a day now..

What is if I have the 12 word seed?

Good news I can move the coins from electrum by trying a new server. The blockchain info wallet is still bugging out though.. Thanks everyone

Thank you. I put my 12 word seed in electrum and it shows my balance but I cannot send it says - 
'The server returned an error when broadcasting the transaction.

I have the latest electrum. It is worth noting that on my blockchain info wallet it wont display my balance most the time and wont send but my bcash wallet is there with a balance and is working etc .
When I click on settings for my btc wallet then I click on wallets and address's I get - ' There is an issue with the wallet and this page may have limited functionality, such as balances not showing.
Message: Server error, please try again later ' This has been going on for 24 hours
