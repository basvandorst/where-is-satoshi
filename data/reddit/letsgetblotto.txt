Great attitude kid.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:30:53
Just pointing out that 19 bitcoin is worth about $200k right now. Id be fucking pissed.
@_date: 2019-07-15 17:26:32
That isnt what happened at all.
You seriously have no understand of what is going on with Mt Gox.

You think Mt Gox is revived? What the actual fuck are you talking about?
You clearly do not understand how bankruptcy works or why/how they are paying people for the coin they lost.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:52:19
I would have been.
But it was still the wild west in 2014.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:27:35
$17k for 19 bitcoins.
But hey at least you got something.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:36:38
I did secure mine.
I'm just not a self serving asshole with empathy for no one but myself.
But what are you even trying to say here? That kids who go to public schools are somehow leaching off the system? 
Are you insane or just a moron?
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:53:54
A bitcoin ATM?
This isnt the wild west anymore. Online exchanges HAVE to verify identity to be allowed to operate.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:59:52
Morons like you are the reason the United States is behind in literally every metric 1st world countries are ranked on.
Oh but I'm sure you think that eliminating taxes to pay for children to go to school means people would be nice and just donate to keep things running.
You're such a fool it's pretty comical.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:37:40
I mean you could say that about any hobby though
I like to play videogames and scuba dive. Neither of those things are "important" and someone could easily see them as frivolous time wasters.
All I'm trying to say is that just because something is very mainstream and you see it as a waste of time doesn't mean someone couldn't say the same things about your hobbies.
@_date: 2019-07-04 23:12:28
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:23:43
Don't be so dramatic.
Do you complain about paying taxes for roads you don't drive on too?
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:47:37
Well then you're a moron
@_date: 2019-07-10 13:50:59
What are you even talking about kid?
I suggest you educate yourself because the government does not "blow" social security money on anything.
Edit: downvote me all you want. Doesn't make it any less true.

Hey I like Bitcoin and Netflix and football.
None of those things are mutually exclusive and not liking Netflix and football doesn't make you better than anyone.

Read an into to Bitcoin website. It's all clearly spelled out if you look
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:49:58
Again you're completely missing the point.
Yes people who bought when it was cheaper have larger gains right now, but again that doesn't matter.
Do you refuse to buy stock because it used to be cheaper?
The whole attitude of "I have to be an early adopter or it isn't worth it" doesn't make any sense.
If you think Bitcoin will continue to go up (it will) then it is a good buy. Simple as that.
Seems like you just want to vent and rage about your lack of foresight though, so if that's the case I don't know what to tell you.
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:01:17

@_date: 2019-06-20 14:46:10
You're looking at it completely wrong.
It doesn't matter how much it costs right now, only how much it will go up.
If you put in $100 and it goes up 100% you'll have $200. if you put in $1000 and it goes up 100% you'll have $2000. The price of the coin doesn't matter.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:38:10
Through places that want a copy of my ID.
This isn't the wild west of crypto anymore. Exchanges are regulated. You cant even buy through LBC with cash anymore.
Just give them your ID.

First step is to calm down.
Back in 2011 people freaked when it went to $31 then crashed to $2
In 2013 people freaked when it went to $1200 then crashed to $200
In 2017 people freaked when it went to $5000 then crashed to $2000
See a pattern here?
Hodl and relax. You need to play the long term game. Short term swings mean very little
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:56:26
Nah. Financial regulators got upset.

Good luck with that. Tripling your money in three months is a pipe dream. If it was easy we would all be rich.

Just say you're buying a product on the internet.
Some banks don't like Bitcoin purchases
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:20:27
No you seem new because it's common knowledge that coinbase takes a shit when big drops happen. It's like clockwork and it's pretty much always been that way.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:55:24
The only losers are the people who are too shortsighted and stubborn to buy right now before it goes parabolic again. 
I guarantee you that in 6-8 months you'll be crying because it's at a new ATH.
Did you just make this post to behave like a whiny child? Or was there some point to it?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:21:21
Don't even try. Buy it and hold it for years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:16:59
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:44:55
I doubt it would be an issue

It'll take decades to build a working one. By then cryptography will be advanced enough to stop at attack

@_date: 2019-06-26 14:56:14
And this is related to Bitcoin how?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:53:06

It costs like $1 to move any amount of bitcoin...
Also you clearly don't understand crypto at all if you think Libra is a great idea.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:32:21
How much bitcoin are we talking about here?
Never hold coin in exchanges unless you would be ok with losing it.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:35:46
If you think you'll want to cash out, or spend it, or whatever anytime soon then by all means keep it somewhere less secure. Coinbase is pretty safe since they're backed by FDIC. 
Ideally you would want to hold your coin in cold storage, but that makes more steps and itll take longer to move it out in the event that you want to use the coin.
But again it is totally up to you. I can't say it's a good idea to hold coin in Coinbase or whatever the hell "cash app" is though.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:26:37
Buy right now! It's going parabolic
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:15:59
Oh it will definitely crash. The only question is what will be the new top and bottom.
It has gone in these cycles for almost a decade. I don't see any reason for it to stop now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:45:50
You should calculate your own fees then I guess.
It will go through. It will just take a long time.
@_date: 2019-02-20 20:57:18
Yeah I guess that's true.
I would still never use a phone wallet to store crypto though
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:22:57
Personally I don't see it pumping Bitcoin at all. Bitcoin was already up 200% in 2019 before Libra was even announced.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:34:43
Donald? Is that you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:40:13
My point is they can't just exit scam and run for the hills like gox did
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:44:08
Sure, but it is REALLY hard to figure out which shitcoins will go parabolic. It's also very hard to know when to buy in and when to sell those shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:49:28
Shitty website I guess
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:31:53
Never ever use PayPal to buy crypto
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:17:02
Situation 3
Don't buy shitcoins and hold your Bitcoin because even if it drops it will go back up
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:18:02
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:25:27
Mt Gox and coinbase aren't even comparable though.
There were little to no regulations back then and coinbase has been going strong for a long time. 
It isn't the wild west anymore.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:30:39
Just cancel your utilities. No more bills and the kids might freeze to death in the winter which would also save you money.

Coinbase is safer, faster, more user friendly (especially to new users), and more stable than kraken.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:07:06
Yeah that is what I plan to do.
Way easier, cheaper, and faster than converting to fiat and back
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:12:39

What are you a flat earther?
How about you post a link with proof? The burden of proof isnt on ME when YOU make wild claims without backing them up.
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:03:13
No it is clear you have no intention of having a debate or listening to any factual arguments. It is very clear you have already made up your very limited mind.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:09:46
I feel safe enough to use it, but Im just some internet stranger.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:34:59
I hear you but coinbase Bitcoin wallets are backed by FDIC. If it's only there for a day or two you're pretty damn safe.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:01:41
I get that, but your image is saying were already past the peak and historically that wouldn't make much sense.
It goes in cycles and has for almost a decade.
The general pattern is it starts going up, people FOMO in, it goes up even faster, more people FOMO in, then it crashes. But it reaches a new ATH before it crashes. Were not even close to that yet.
The last time it broke 10k it was at 20k in 9 days. Give it a few more days.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:14:40
@_date: 2019-02-19 19:31:52
Well I'm not a moron so no thanks. I don't think I'll be storing my coins on any exchange. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:13:29
I love it.
It creates media attention, which makes people FOMO in, which makes it go higher faster, which makes people FOMO in. 
Once it hits the new top Ill sell and buy back in at the next bottom. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:03:35
Well I would guess 1/3...
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:56:15

Link to the transaction?
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:44:15
So you don't have any legitimate reasons to think Binance is a scam. Got it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:15:34
In case you haven't noticed coinbase is having issues right now
