Yeah, makes you feel so much safer! I just purchased the Ledger Nano S and it works fine and feels much secure than holding it on an exchange. You can’t get hacked now.

You still made $5500 in a couple of weeks without doing anything!!! You basically made money while you were sleeping!

You were one of the panic sellers. But people will buy again when it gets lower and the price is going to be more stable and up again. This is normal, it happened a lot of times before.

Just hold on to it!!! This is normal in Bitcoin it will go up again and only get higher just takes a while.

Panic sells, when people see that the price goes down lower and lower they tend to quickly sell their coins to prevent any more loss. But when they sell, there are people that HODLing and profit from those people that sell and quickly buy more Bitcoin when the price was around 18K.

No they’re not, I purchased there a few times. Just be patience.

Ahhh why did you this, now you’re stressing so hard :-( never invest more than you can lose!! Most people just put in 5-10% of their money but not EVERYTHING. Just hold on and wait this out for a while. A lot going on with bitcoin cash, it will crash and people will buy bitcoin again

Everything he had... poor guy... he just had to wait till it goes up again. He probably thought he would get rich quick with Bitcoin and probably in debt and just threw all his money in hoping it would rise quickly.
