When it's 'worth' that much in USD, it will be because the USD effectively doesn't matter anymore. At that point it will be priceless in USD. Figuratively, at least...

Well that took a turn...

How much does Papa Bcash (Ver) own in BTC? I remember him havin a ludicrous amount but that was before selling to support his coin...

OP name checks out. Loves BTC

Ah yes, bitcoin Judas... I wasn’t around last halving, and thanks for the assumption of positive intent! /s

I’ve done the same thing and the overall balance isn’t updating after a successful transaction. Further, it is saying I sent more than I actually did, and the balance is higher than it’s supposed to be... wut?

Anywhere else the economics of mining should be discussed? I understand the difficulty adjustment rather well but am always trying to learn more.

This is great! Thank you!

Wait, so can we not use LIFO anymore?

I don't believe this to be true with the most recent release. He notes that you can either use a remote node or have Zap spin one up for you. This was a big change in the most recent version.

My comment was strictly regarding recouping your investment. If you're not diversified, that's an entirely different issue.
I continue to invest at a specific rate that keeps my investments diversified. However, the idea of 'pulling out my initial investment' is irrelevant to me because I will continue to invest.

Only buy DIRECT from the company. NEVER on ebay or amazon or others...
Also, if the package has been opened when you get it, do not use it. Send it back and get one that's brand new...

Can you clarify what you mean? Paper wallet? Seed phrase stamped into steel/aluminum? Something cool I've never seen before?
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:49:26
This is true, but functionally different than recouping your investment. Words matter.

It's pretty awesome that it had that much money in it in the first place...
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:47:51
This is an excellent suggestion, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:51:53
That is a completely separate (but related) concept. You should already be diversified to the level that's right for you.
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:48:26
Aww bikes, this might be more than I'm willing to try given my know-how, but thank you for the thoughtful response and I hope others can use it!

Their fees are around 1.75%. Too high (IMO) given the gains that we're all banking on...

Do people realize this only matters if you don't intend to buy more? 
Selling to recoup your investment only applies if you're trying to eliminate your risk. Which, in a vacuum, is a great idea. However, it also assumes you're not going to continue investing. If you ever intend to buy any more Crypto, then what's the point of recouping your investment?
If you're selling to take profits, that's one thing (that I also disagree with as a real strategy), but recouping investment is a strategy suitable only for those folks who are actually done investing.

My thoughts exactly! This one is being advertised on Quora through an "Ex-investment banker" profile who "makes over $100K per month"...

Thanks for the info. I guess I'll just have to reconcile against giving up my personal info. Much appreciated!
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:58:50
How do you mean?

What's the best way to defrag using a Trezor? Do I simply send a transaction for all of my BTC to one of my alternate addresses, basically sending from myself to myself? Or should I send to Coinbase (or similar) and immediately send back to my Trezor?
