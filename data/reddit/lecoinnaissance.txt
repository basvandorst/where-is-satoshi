Having your data compromised to the extent that the cleanup operation costs $15 million is not even in the same league as this fuckup. This is more akin to your bank getting robbed and the bank telling you they're sorry they didn't realise they left the back door open, but due to legal constraints, they can't tell you anymore. Sorry again

People are pleased more by the man himself, not his affairs.
A lot of his endeavours are a bit whimsical, sometimes a bit narcissistic, but then again I also feel he'll be changing the world in different ways for many years to come

What gives you that idea? We actually heard straight from a Brazilian man only a couple of months ago on this subreddit giving us a detailed outlook on the current situation. It was pretty far from "warmed up" as you say. Read the article

I think that's our job. In return for showing them how it works, they protect us from fraud. It doesn't sound all that unfair to me. What is inevitable is that they are always going to stumble and trip around the technology, which is thoroughly entertaining of course

It would be in their best interests to have a healthy and functioning Bitcoin Blockchain. By creating a transaction per trade system, would they not be shooting themselves in the foot?
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:17:20
I think what he means is that those conservative Wall Streeters who tremble at the thought of a Blockchain society and shit their little silk panties, need not even purchase a Bitcoin to destroy it's value. 
But I agree, I think those people are fewer and farther between by the day.

So tired of everyone whinging about how little money they are going to make, or how unfair 21 are being. What did you expect? That your toaster was going to pop you out a shiny new coin every 7 days? 
This is about supporting the network. Mining as a means of confirming transactions, which is what mining is. Not digging Bitcoins out of nowhere.
@_date: 2015-05-19 23:04:34
Hmmm, quite the conundrum there. I guess 21 inc must have forgotten to factor this one in. If only they just had a means of confirming their own transactions. Oh wait. Even I thought of that. Mining chips do exactly that. Wake up and smell the coffee

The only issue with circle is banking fees for withdrawal and deposit, if you live in Europe. Sepa/Swift payments with kraken seem to be the most cost effective, at least here in the UK
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:08:35
And the engineering of financial models and systems fits under what, exactly? OP's fantasies of the "collapse of the finance industry" just show that Bitcoin is still not ready for the mainstream

You've got nothing to substantiate your claims other than someone else's report written on a few pages of wordpress, and yet still speak with absolute authority as the almighty truth-bearing historian. Fucking listen to the man

Please explain how realising that you got the raw end of a deal constitutes reasonable grounds to nullify said deal? You might vouch for them in supporting the idea that Roger's own legal issues were becoming a concern for OKcoin's public image and regulatory affairs, but we both know that wasn't the cause. 
Nor have you addressed the issue of the forgery, which, as seems to be the case, looks 100% verifiable. How can you justify that?
This is not about whether or not OKcoin is insolvent, this is about their reputation getting shot to shit. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:08:22
I agree, but in the same regard GBTC carries far less exposure to risk. Enter new asset class, and live and let live
@_date: 2015-05-16 20:28:29
Looking forward to more news from 21 on this front

The foreign exchange on those payments must be extortionate? I'm curious as to how they envision customers allowing them to charge GBP from an account denominated only in BTC. Amongst other things this is what gives me the feeling that xapo is focused more on serving high net worth interests and associates of Casares 
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:24:47
Can you confirm this would be possible? If you're aware of any law which might qualify the situation, could you confirm for us that OkCoin's assets are liable to be seized purely off the back of this?

Michael Casey specifically said he put Bitcoin in there with his article, obviously didn't go down too well with the editors. When it's acceptable to scream Bitcoin from the rooftops, they will. First they need someone to herd them to the rooftops :)

I may be wrong here certainly, but is it not the case that increasing bandwidth capacity may ultimately help solve the issue of centralisation with larger block sizes?
Peter's views on scaleability do worry me slightly, in any case.
@_date: 2015-05-05 23:42:59
What a sweeping statement there, congratulations
@_date: 2015-05-20 01:57:13
Well, I know the argument you're pursuing, and I know the solution, only because it's in plain sight right in front our eyes. So any other misunderstanding which I may or may not have is irrelevant.
Edit: Just waking up will do you fine
@_date: 2015-05-24 01:11:29
And the forgery? We can agree on the terms of the contract, if even ignoring the obvious short-coming in OKC's own commitment to the contract, in honouring the terms that *were* for it's own benefit, but forgery and attempted money laundering are no means of resolving such a situation.
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:31:39
So, would a single transaction per block system not be feasible?
If Nasdaq were to go full throttle with a transaction per trade system as you say (and let's say fees were at 10 cents), then just 10 minutes of trading settlement would cost them 0.1(53000*600), the numbers in brackets being the amount of transactions made every 10 minutes if we assume a fixed rate of 53,000 transactions per second. That's $3,180,000 every 10 minutes in transaction fees for Nasdaq, or just under half a billion every day. 
I'm not sure what the traditional settlement costs are, but surely this would be a major step backward, to put it lightly?
@_date: 2015-05-06 00:39:41
I feel like the latter has enough time right now to keep up? Very much agree though, here's to watching it all unfold. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:04:30
If this were to happen their closed loop proposition would be redundant. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 12:12:24
I don't disagree with you. But I'm talking long term, or in an otherwise non-variable situation, wherein GBTC might not fluctuate as heavily as Bitcoin from small and irrelevant market news frenzies

Seems like a credible hedging strategy for some. Others might find better suited risk elsewhere. And the world keeps on spinning

Perhaps different jurisdictions play a role in the case of counties like Norway who shouldn't actually pose a risk of that sort - you're right. I'd be interested to know

Since when does legislation constitute a fair representation of reality
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:19:28
Why on earth would they outlaw any transactions not made in "BRITcoin"? Having a base currency, as already stated, would be for the central bank to retain monopoly power. It wouldn't immediately rule the use of any alternative medium of exchange as illegal
If cash were to be abolished, it would happen only when banks were ready to switch customer accounts over to compatibility with the new digital currency. Given the stability of the process, the strict regulatory oversight, the enormous media coverage etc there would be no need to enforce these dystopian rules you speak of. If people decided that process wasn't stable enough, they might move a portion of their wealth into btc. That would be their choice, and perhaps a widespread choice, not forgetting the fact that even the non-technical general public would have 1) learnt about the technology that makes btc possible, encouraging them to trust btc much more, and 2) the opportunity to use a currency that is far more interoperable with btc

So what do you recommend, that the Blockchain not be used as a tool for high level data storage? Let private 'Blockchains' take centre stage for the next 1-2 years? It may not be good for Bitcoin the currency to have Fidelity jumping on board, but Bitcoin should be about far more than just the currency. Think of the innovation at stake with those levels of cost reduction and increased efficiency. I know there is no decentralised alternative, so while some companies might prefer to use shared databases or private Blockchains for their outfit, which is absolutely fine and still valid for many I'm sure, others will want to use Bitcoin's Blockchain. We need to prepare ourselves for these outfits, and Fidelity seems to be a good case in point 
@_date: 2015-09-23 20:37:46
Remember the part with the freedom of information? 
@_date: 2015-09-24 11:29:54
Who said it was about storing data? I'm sure you know who Fidelity are. I'll bet their interest goes beyond that
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:16:24
Yes, if nothing changes. You're taking your current outlook on Bitcoin and using it to justify your wildly pessimistic predictions which run many years and even decades into the future. Short sighted is an understatement. Congratulations for figuring out why it's not worth 20x its value today
