Trading at 0.12 BTC at the time of writing. Looks like there's some trading activity - some folk are quick off the mark!

Yeah, I'd definitely encrypt before storing on any cloud service. That's where Yubikey and their authenticator is good, it's tied to your physical key. Obviously a problem if you loose the yubikey but you can add a backup key to your setup to mitigate that.

That's exactly why I don't use it. I may check out authenticator plus as a backup. Install it on my tablet in case I lose my phone. Cheers

Two factor is a must. If you buy a yubikey neo, there is an excellent authenticator app that goes with. 
Google authenticator is free and does the job. Worth printing a copy of the qr code used to set up each account (somewhere safe), in case you loose your phone or it breaks etc., so you can get back up and running quickly.

Convenience vs security here. Plus, are you not using 2FA on your Dropbox account? (-;

Would the government pay 30% of your losses? 
Sounds like a shit deal to me

Can say the same for Bitstamp, transferred btc earlier today and it was it my wallet by the time I checked a few minutes later. Set up a Gemini account last month but not used it yet.

I live in the UK. I've not withdrawn funds via Bitstamp, it's all been GBP - &gt; EUR - &gt; BTC so far

Coinbase and Bitstamp have worked well for me. Both require some amount of verification but not over the top
