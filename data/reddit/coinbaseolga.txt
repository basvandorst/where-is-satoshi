When creating a purchase with some types of credit cards, your bank may charge an additional “cash advance” fee. To avoid these fees, you can switch to using a debit card or linked bank account instead.
You can read more about this on our [Pricing and Fees Disclosure]( page.

We will not re-enable buys, sells, sends, or receives until our team deems such transactions to be safe. We hope to have buying and selling up within 24 hours and sending and receiving up within 48.

Bitcoin Segwit2x does not have any built-in replay protection, but Coinbase has implemented our own replay protection system. You can safely send any BTC or B2X from Coinbase without worrying about replays on the other chain.

Your BCH balance on Coinbase will be based on how much BTC you had on Coinbase at the time of the original fork rather than at the time of our support for BCH being launched. You're free to move your coins off of Coinbase without this affecting your BCH balance.

We transfer funds to your Coinbase account as quickly as possible, however it takes 3-5 business days for the funds to flow between banks using ACH transfers. You can read more about this [here]( 
Please remember that 3-5 business days can sometimes take 7-10 calendar days, depending on the timing of weekends and other bank holidays.
You may already see that the funds have been removed from your bank account, but your Coinbase account will not be credited until funds have finished moving between the banks and clear in our bank account.

The purchase/sell limit in your account is set by Coinbase and varies based on a number of factors including purchase history. Newer accounts without an established purchase history usually have lower limits.
Limits are also adjusted automatically up or down based on a number of security algorithms.
Please keep in mind that your limit is temporary. As your account builds a good purchase history with Coinbase, your limits will increase naturally (and fairly rapidly). I apologize that we are unable to offer immediate limit increases upon request.
Note that bank transfers allow the highest limits. Using your card (such as a debit card) offers instant delivery of your bitcoin but the limit is much lower. Limit increases affect both your bank transfer limit and card purchase limits.
A good purchase history is established by the amount of bitcoin your buy along with an established account. At any time you can view the next steps to increase your limits [here]( and, once all of these steps have been completed, request higher limits [here]( Unfortunately, we cannot expedite wait times required.

It's not a reward per se - we're simply offering customers the chance to access the B2X they will have stored on our platform as a result of the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:19:38
[Olga from Coinbase here.](
There are two forks in this question: BCH, which forked back in August (and will be supported on Coinbase by January) and Segwit2X (which is upcoming). We will credit our customers an equal amount of B2X as they have BTC stored in their account at the time of the fork. For example, if you have 1.23 BTC on Coinbase when the fork occurs, you will be credited 1.23 B2X.

The GDAX prices in each market are set by the order book in that specific market. If demand differs between markets, prices may also differ.

This is incorrect. There is no telling what the market value for either coin in USD will be. However, if you had 1.23 BTC at the time of the fork, you will have both 1.23 BTC and 1.23 B2X after the fork.

When placing a buy or sell order, Coinbase locks in the price that is quoted at the time of transaction for 30 seconds. Even if the price changes, we still honor that price, so to account for this volatility we may add a spread to the total.
We only add spread to the buy and sell price on Coinbase, while in other places we quote the current market rate from GDAX, which is calculated purely as a function of supply and demand on the platform.
I hope this helps!

A combination of several factors can get a transaction flagged as unusual, like if the funds are being sent to a new address or using a new device. This is a method we use to try to prevent funds lost due to account compromise.
When that happens, we delay the transaction and email you to give you time to cancel it if it actually was unauthorized, or offer you the opportunity to complete a "face match" verification, uploading pictures of the front and back of your photo ID and taking a live webcam picture of your face, to verify you _were_ the one who authorized the transaction.

Just a clarification - the GDAX method you describe would not be possible if the OP is hesitant about completing identity verification required for limits, since GDAX access requires all verifications to be complete.

The fee to which you're referring is the network transaction fee paid to Bitcoin minors and applies to all outgoing transactions. This fee is paid to the miners, not to Coinbase. It's determined by the amount of Bitcoin sent in *bytes*, not USD. Based on how our hot wallet is set up, you'll be paying the same transaction fee if you're sending $1 worth of Bitcoin or $300.
Because the network is congested right now, these fees are higher than normal at this time.
You can read more about network fees [here](
*Edit* It's also worth noting that we do *not* charge this fee on Coinbase-to-Coinbase transactions sent via email.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:43:37
[Olga from Coinbase here.](
I'd be happy to clarify.
We don't set the current network fees, the miners do. You can check the status of current network fees on sites like [ and the network fee you will pay for the transaction will be quoted to you before you confirm the send. This fee is a part of using the blockchain and is also paid when sending from other devices, such as hardware wallets. This fee is paid to the digital currency miners, who process the transactions and secure the respective network.
If you send from one Coinbase account to another Coinbase account using the *email* associated with the account, you will not pay a network fee because the transaction will occur off of the blockchain.

Any customer with a BTC balance on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the B2X asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required — we will automatically credit your account. So, if you have 5 BTC stored on Coinbase before the fork; you will have 5 BTC and 5 B2X following the event.

Thanks for asking! This is a bit of a complicated question.
We do not support GBP withdrawals at this time, but do support EUR withdrawals. We have two articles about this on our support site - [here]( and [here]( but the tl;dr is that we require for GBP to be converted into EUR for deposits and withdrawals.
We're working on adding support for GBP, but unfortunately I cannot disclose a timeline.
