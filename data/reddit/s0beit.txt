Question because I don't know much about camera quality or how much folds in clothes can effect a QR code: Could you ever accidentally pay somebody else with a QR code if there is an error of some kind?
Also reminded of research on flipped bits in memory under certain conditions causing DNS queries to be hijacked... Bitsquatting on Google for those interested.
Getting a code wrong resulting in paying the wrong person on accident (even if its only a bit or so off) could be possible, but I'm not really sure how much of an issue it would be.

Quick warning about them, though, their DMCA policy is god awful.
You will get requests to remove content and be nullrouted within 24 hours or sometimes less if you do not respond. For any request. From anyone. Doesn't matter what, its completely automated.
Now, some people might run services with absolutely no user input and no community to speak of who don't have to worry about that, but if you want to run something interactive I'd avoid them like the plague.
I'd canceled their service ages ago because I couldn't put up with endless nerve wrecking claims from Funimation for anime avatars on my forum or because some movie title was in my URL slug.

1 in 4.29 billion isn't a lot if bitcoin were to become truly popular and in common use. I'm not sure how many transactions happen every day (on the planet), but it wouldn't take long to reach that point.
However, if the addresses have a checksum like somebody else stated that would probably make the risk a lot less.

I once bought a Linode VPS to host a MySQL server and the costs were outrageous, not only that, the bandwidth is not proportionate to the amount paid _at all_.

Never said this was good, or bitcoin was necessarily good, only that the issue isn't solved now, *under a government*, in fact it is so obviously amplified in this case because the government is the one doing the harm.


Because we live under government and this issue isn't solved. It can't be anarchy's fault, there is no anarchy.


Market anarchism doesn't exist right now, big government does. So far they're slated to allow user's information to be sold, and with that information they would arrest those people.
Anarchism hasn't done any of that. Your government has.
 


No, it's like saying this problem in the OP exists now under government, so attributing fault at least solely to market anarchism is insane.

Unless those people are abusing their position. If they are notorious double spenders, people would just stop taking them due to risk incurred. If they are not notoriously abusive, though, there'd be no reason to not take them.

So? Libertarians like bitcoin, but bitcoin has nothing to do with libertarianism explicitly.

I don't know how the site works *precisely*, but I imagine the user's wallet value (BTC amount) was stored in SQL, and only updated when money was transferred in or out *by the website's code*.
Meaning, if you were to transfer that money out and did not inform the site's database of that 'transaction', it would not be tallied, and the value would appear to be the same as before as it was a transaction made outside of the site's knowledge.
There is other ways they could have done it as well, if the wallets were updated with the blockchain for example (meaning the above method wouldn't work), they could have initiated a new bitcoin transaction to drain the wallet, or take some out of it, hidden the transaction from the user's panel by blacklisting their transactions only, and faking the user's amount.
Depends how the code looks, but I'm sure there's no shortage of ways to fool people using only the online wallet. If it was checked against another wallet program you'd have theft confirmation, though.
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:24:27


That is completely false. Not only has it not been long enough to determine that it 'works' in every country using it now, there has clearly been failures littered throughout history. The medicare system worked for a very long time, until it didn't.




[citation needed], it does not follow that private sector would always and absolutely have a higher cost, and in fact, in many instances that is proven to be absolutely correct. How does it even follow that government will always have the absolute lowest cost?
Is it because money taken from other isn't a cost to you? Total, absolute cost is very much a huge burden.


Because I'm not forced to do it, because it's not a monopoly, because it will encourage better practices when there is actually competitors.


Being found out would mean the purpose for their entire being was completely shattered and nobody will ever trust them again, in a business built completely around trust.




I answered this and more in my reply [here](

I mean, what's to say that a particular part of that product isn't properly tested and has something in it that can cause enormous health issues 30-40 years down the line?
I don't see how the FDA can solve this problem any more than a competitor could. Either it goes on the market with unknown side-effects, or it is given a black label (taken off the market in the case of the FDA), or it is sold and vetted - despite problems - because the technology did not exist to forsee those problems. We don't have time machines, so knowing what would cause side-effects 30-40 years down the line would require scientific research (which the FDA and companies can both accomplish) or it would require 30-40 years of use to determine the side-effects.


The FDA **is** a monopoly. I mean, yes, there could be a company which does it better than most, but if they at any point lost trust (made a mistake), consumers could demand that they be vetted at company  or  or boycott their products.
I just don't see how the current arrangement actually fixes that problem in any way.


Again, it is inherently a monopoly right now. The current arrangement of tax and spend hasn't really alleviated that issue in any sense.
That said, if a company was not meeting it's obligations it could face consumer backlash (other companies who paid for their services, or users) and it could be settled in court (arbitration, which I'll be getting to later).
You'd say: And if they get a settlement? So what? There's still only one road company, take it or leave it.
I imagine that people who initially build the roads and people who actually maintain them would be separate entities. This would simplify the problem ten-fold, and would be the preferred consumer choice (you can easily fire a maintenance company).
Let's pretend it's one company though, for the sake of argument.
They could accept a contract with negotiating terms, for one thing, but they could also talk up rival companies to take the area over and maintain it.
If people are fed up with the company to the point nobody wants them to exist, they could lure a competitor in to purchase the roads and maintain the existing ones.
The citizens are in a bind, but remember that the company who built the roads would be a bind as well. They can't just pick up and take their roads with them if they fail, and people wouldn't be obligated to pay for obligations not fulfilled by the road company, so the object of the game is to please the consumer.
Finally, failing ALL of these potential solutions, they could simply stop using the roads and completely bankrupt that area. They'd have to sell at that point, face huge losses, or be taken to court for failure to fulfill obligations.
Back to the multiple road thing: No, I imagine they'd pay several companies for one road because there's only demand for one road. Competition doesn't need to be in every place simultaneously, it just needs to offer alternatives. Is a car 'inherently a monopoly' because I only drive one at a time?


Sparsely populated **!=** less profitable. There could be the exact same amount of profit, but the cost of labor and materials might be greater, thus a premium is paid.
I imagine people who live far from society or in areas where roads are hard to build will pay a premium, yes. This would draw people in towards others and lessen the burden on society. People pay a premium for internet and water in many cases too when they're isolated from society. This isn't something new. It is the cost of effectively wasting scarce resources to cater to a minority. If somebody decides to plant a house atop a mountain, is the government going to pave a road to it?


This is actually a very good point, and quite closely related!
The main issue with internet today is infrastructure, correct. The government generally owns the 'property' companies use to place their lines, and they tightly control who has access to them, how many have access at any given time, who is allowed to invest and build infrastructure and so on. That isn't the case absent the government. *People* would choose who to lure to their neighborhoods (I'm sure a ton of people would be kicking their providers out and jumping all over Google right now if they could), and those same people who own the property the lines are being installed around and into would dictate the terms (such as, quality of service and usage of property). I consider that a great thing.
"In many areas there's just one provider" is not a necessarily harmful thing in and of itself, though. What if other companies can find no way to enter the market through share productive inferiority? What if the job is a legitimately huge undertaking, like running fiber to an extremely rural community?
The monopoly in this case would still be a monopoly, but it would be a productive monopoly. The alternative to that monopoly existing is no internet at all, so you can't say it is always necessarily bad.


Well again, it depends on demand. *Do people want a safe home? Do people want a home built to a certain standard?* Somebody should vet it, then.
If they build the home themselves, though, and opt out of that arrangement, it is at their own peril (and they may be liable for injuries or disasters that occur on their property, though those are muddy waters and it's only going to get more complex if I try to explain it).


Ah yes, the famous "everyone is an idiot" approach. The market does not require you be a genius. The market only needs you to observe and decide the more favorable outcome. People don't need to know if their house is up to code, they can hire a person who is an expert to *tell them* if their house is up to code. Not many people are knowledgeable on building codes right now, yet they know enough that they need somebody to inspect their house to be sure it won't collapse. Somebody only needs to fill that demand.


Well, first I think it's important to note that any such 'portion' of the population who steadfastly refused to allow their children schooling would be a minority. I think it's certainly possible that people might *want* to keep their children from school, but at the same time many people have a say over whether or not they allow children to be kept from school or not.
Some places (in which you live) might have policies against children left unattended, or unschooled (liability), some places might not allow unschooled children or parents into their facilities for the same reasons, incentivizing schooling in some form. It is all really dependent on how society feels it should be handled, and what repercussions if any would follow.


To the first point, the people choose the laws the police enforce.
Beyond that I can only make educated guesses. 
Again, what is important is what people want, and I can't speak to the subjective preferences of millions. What becomes "law" is what people desire to be "law". Just up and declaring "things will be like this!" is just not possible, because what I want might not necessarily reflect the views of society, and it might not be the most efficient way to conduct business.
"What happens if you're mugged in the street?", ideally I'd want him to pay for the losses I've incurred monetarily and emotionally after they are caught by an agency I've chosen. If you're asking what happens as you're being mugged, well, I guess I'll be mugged. Stopping a mugging in progress has got to be extremely uncommon.
"Does the security agency turn a blind eye if you're not insured with them?", maybe, maybe not. They could charge the 'uninsured' a premium to protect them if there is an immediate threat and they are upon you when you are in danger (this very rarely happens in society, it's much more common to respond to a call than for a police officer to immediately respond to a crime happening in front of them, though it does happen), maybe they end up in arbitration disputing fees, maybe they train those in their company to protect random citizens for free so that they buy their security in the future. There's no shortage of different ways it could go down.

Could be, but -


Realistically, anyone on the internet who has done nothing majorly illegal and who uses a VPN/Proxy like he most likely did. It's a possibility he isnt NSA and we wouldn't know his identity, but maybe somebody in some government somewhere does (by having records of his activity) - since he's done nothing illegal, there really isn't much reason to out him, though I guess they could to throw bitcoin markets into chaos a bit.


Information about the dual elliptic curve being not so hot isn't exactly new, it could be any number of people who were critical of it due to it's background, or just didn't select it by chance.


Always a possibility. It's also a possibility that they would use bitcoin to funnel illicit funds to not so nice people, or that they could otherwise track users by it's nature and push the black market into a semi-controlled currency, however I find that very unlikely, since the first few people who get prosecuted would throw up red flags all over the place.
The black market quickly reacts to scams of that sort, they'd wise up too quickly for that to be viable.

HTML would be the only client-side thing happening in that scenario. That's sort of the point, though.
Cutting out server-delivered javascript would be more secure, and though I agree it's a worry that is perhaps unwarranted in many cases (though not all), you could still make a website like blockchain operate without javascript or really any plugin or addon.
Though making a chrome addon might be a nice idea for them, it saves bandwidth and delivers the same quality while being more secure, it shouldnt replace the main site though, maybe a no-js subdomain would be cool.

Capitalism's entire purpose is allocating scarce resources. It doesn't assume abundance where there isn't any. Prices reflect scarcity, among other things.

1. If they can't contribute to roads, maybe they shouldn't be driving on them?
2. Medical care is easily workable, it was prior to maximum government over-regulation mode, and it's workable now. More so, actually. Government regulation has completely decimated the medical industry in America.
3. Firefighting is not an especially complex service. And again, if people can't afford some sort of insurance to protect their home, *maybe a costly home isn't the right plan for them*. I imagine insurance for rented apartments or shared properties would have it built into the rent.
Just for good measure, though, let's address some arguments made later in the thread.


Companies who's job it is to oversee safety at companies. People will then not buy from places that have rat shit in their food because they aren't vetted by anyone.


Road building companies. The logistics of that is not that complex when you actually *think critically* and just try to think of how a company providing a service people need might profit. *No, you're right, that's crazy*.
You can have tolls, or ads, or companies who need roads build to their establishments (built into the cost of starting a business) or housing communities, or drivers buying licenses to operate on those roads (after passing some form of test to actually access those roads, whoa sounds so familiar) pay for the roads. I'm not sure which of these many methods the market will find most favorable, but it'll be one of those, and only drivers or people who want roads built to their properties would have to pay - not externalizing the cost on to people who don't drive.


Again, agencies who's job it is to vet things. Would this cover businesses *and* homes? Don't know. It depends, do people demand homes be vetted and not built like shit? Do people demand more freedom in building their personal homes? Who knows.


Most likely companies would train their own workers who want to take up a trade.
The argument is usually made for *general education*, not specialized skills, because specialized skills are something you can easily jam into a person's head eager and willing. Don't know how you thought that was a good argument.
As for general education, that could be taught by private schools, home schools, or community schools (like, one person from the neighborhood teaching children, which might be less expensive than a private school, or possibly even free depending, like maybe all of the parents cover a single day to teach their children which is the day they have off, and maybe companies allow workers to conform to that schedule). Lots of solutions. Better yet, again, the cost doesn't need to be externalized and placed upon those who decided not to have children, or who don't need your money to send their children to school (home school, private school).


Replace "firefighting" with "police work" in answer  and there you go.


People who accept money from those who have toilets, because they don't want their house or apartment complex full of poop.

There is no implicit lack of alternatives, though. People are just doing what is best for themselves.
Suppose a scenario comes about where 51% of miners are in one pool and that pool is attacking vendors consistently, eventually I imagine people would just stop taking coins from that pool, if such a threat emerged.
Then miners would join another pool, and so on and so forth (assuming one can even capture the entirety of the mining market and assuming they will thoroughly abuse that position)


You're somehow conflating libertarianism with bitcoin, and linking the tragedy of the commons with an ideology of individual ownership of goods.
Even assuming everything the doom sayers comes to pass, bitcoin will simply fail. A lesson learned.
Libertarianism does not presuppose things will never fail. Failure is an important market mechanism.
