Just the fact that I didn't have to give my info to a company that I'm only using for three days was worth it. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:36:38
Because that is what surprised me. I knew I would be protecting my info. I just didn't realize it would essentially be instant and so  easy
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:54:43
Nice list! I ended up using air VPN and have no complaints
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:58:27
There's nothing I would've done besides create a rant thread so everyone else knew they were a scam.  I definitely did some research before committing, and couldn't find anything negative about their services
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:52:47
Hmm In their post yesterday they cited the spam attack as the reason they're having issues.
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:22:37
And discover card
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:07:48
Cool. I was able to get it working again
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:32:27
Worked for me as well. Any ideas as to why this would be? Mycellium being blocked In the US perhaps? What country are you in?
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:28:27
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:41:40
Makes sense.  You're reminding me how little I know :/  ive just gotten comfortable with bitcoin and now I'm struggling to figure out dogecoin. Can't imagine having knowledge of all of those!  If you have the time, I'd tip some bits for a short explanation of your "favorite" alts or the ones you think I should look into. Or maybe some resources I should check out? I know it's a complicated topic so no biggy
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:35:39
Can you elaborate on your reasoning?
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:57:04
Any idea why all I hear about is dogecoin then? Sounds like the other 2 would be more useful yet I've never heard of namecoin and litecoin only once or twice. Thanks for the response btw  100 bits @_date: 2015-04-11 00:36:42
I made it!
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:55:12
Thanks for the response 100 bits @_date: 2015-04-20 12:29:40
I don't have to go to the atm to get cash if I want to buy something outside of a store
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:58:29
Also, what do you mean by "liquid"? 100 bits @_date: 2015-10-12 14:17:09
New hard drive for my laptop 
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:26:41
That does make sense,  but at the same time the mediator needs to be able to contact both parties.  An email would do I suppose
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:10:46
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:02:17
Why not what? 
@_date: 2015-03-22 03:09:02
Sorry. Misunderstood you
@_date: 2015-10-11 19:39:28
Just posted it on the sub. Feel free to share all known meets on the sub! Thanks!

$1 @_date: 2015-10-14 15:12:49
This. Super slow. I tried to deposit on Thursday or Friday and it's just now showing as a pending transaction at my bank
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:08:32
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-10-03 03:06:17
I'm not a huge fan of them. Feel like the printouts are advertising for them and then the qr code redirects you to their website instead of directly depositing (which may not be possible. I'm not really sure) 
@_date: 2015-10-25 03:42:10
It's definitely super terrible, but it obviously wasn't on purpose.. Sometimes you just can't help but laugh. Seems like he had no Idea what to expect
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:58:01
Hii  :)
@_date: 2015-10-11 16:04:21
Just watched this last night. It's cool that bitcoin is making it into mainstream media, but it would certainly be better if it wasn't linked to drug dealing.
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:14:42
All of my purchases have been through coinbase because they're instant. I wanted to try out Gemini, but even with a confirmed bank account it takes 3-4 days to get them
@_date: 2015-10-16 18:02:32
Promoting bitcoin doesn't do any good if people can't use it. There's not a good day to day use case for the average person yet, at least not one people will be willing to learn about a new currency over. Once more/new companies begin to accept bitcoin, promotion will be more viable. That's my opinion anyway.

What's the best way to make a paper wallet? 
@_date: 2015-10-11 19:30:14
There's already a semi active FB page i found with a google search. it's here - 
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:21:15
How do you like ledger? Do you think its worth the investment? 
@_date: 2015-10-03 17:43:10
I don't. That's why I made this thread! Hopefully someone else comes up with something 
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:09:29
So I load the bitcoin address and I give them the bitcoin address and the private key or just one or the other? Sorry this is kind of new to me. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:20:13
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-10-09 18:14:31
I am not. Simply replacing a faulty drive from an old Sony viao 
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:08:25
Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:18:25
It's under maintenance right now but I'll try it when it's back online
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:58:16
I definitely get that. I just don't get how you go about finding that person. If you're trading with a random person online what are the chances there's someone you mutually trust? 
@_date: 2015-10-04 23:06:42
Over at we've got a few really nice options for gambling with bitcoin on Android. If you go to best-all there's a link to the bitcoin video casino app which is my favorite! 
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:02:50
Okay so far this looks like the best method to me. So I load the bitcoin address and then hold onto the private key to take the bitcoin back if they don't take it? Sorry i'm new to this. All i've ever done is used mycellium
@_date: 2015-10-11 20:24:55
I'm honestly not getting that vibe. When someone hates on something your passionate about its only natural to try to get them to see your point of view. Our job/mission should be to figure out how to do that while not coming off as "elitist assholes" as you say. I for one make mention of bitcoin to people who I think could handle it as frequently as possible, but I'm never pushy. Recently my line has been "hey you know the WinkleVoss guys from the social network? They opened a bitcoin exchange just recently" that way people can relate in some minor way. Either that or I offer them $5 worth if they want to try it out. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 03:50:01
I did sorry about that
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:20:33
I live in the US and I'm the only person I know who uses bitcoin. It will take time to get people on board. Be patient and try to bring it up once in awhile without annoying people and hopefully someone will bite 
@_date: 2015-10-03 19:37:30
Okay sweet! I'm testing it out now.  Here's 1000 bits for the help! 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:45:47
Any recommendations on an android mobile wallet? I'm new to this
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:41:15
It's tough to say what will happen in 30 to 40 years.. I think "never" is being a bit too confident in your predictions. At the same time, I'm certainly not banking on retiring off of one bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 22:01:44
Always always always write your seed down in a safe place. Hopefully someone from mycelium can help out with this. Doesn't sound good though. Good luck OP
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:57:02
Bought a pack of blank dvds on new egg and added some time to my vpn subscription! I've been using bitcoin more and more now that I've found Newegg.
@_date: 2015-03-22 02:25:17
You may have read the title wrong. I support this idea/website
@_date: 2015-10-09 21:52:38
It could go to zero and I'd be fine. It certainly wouldn't help my financial situation but it wouldn't break me by any means 
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:25:36
I've checked this out, just not a ton of activity. I was hoping to get the opinion of a more broad range of people 
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:51:21

Here's $.50 for helping me out
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:29:25
I love the generosity surrounding bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:06:53
Yeah I find the majority of the discussion here is not that over the top. Certainly many people here are invested in bitcoin becoming a success and don't try to hide it, but generally people aren't arrogantly hating on anyone who doesn't use bitcoin. I've only been here for a year or so, so maybe I missed a lot of that, but I find this community to be just as reasonable as any other sub I visit.  There's always obnoxious outliers making stupid comments. That's just part of reddit and society as a whole. 
@_date: 2015-10-11 18:02:44
I definitely get that, and honestly I'm not opposed to it (stupid drug war), but it still makes bitcoin an easy target for "it's bad cause drug dealers use it". Obviously is a stupid argument because drug dealers have been using cash forever, but unfortunately you can't fix stupid.
