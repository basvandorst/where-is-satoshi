Because the monetary mechanism for QE is wrong.  The money should be distributed straight to consumers by crediting their bank accounts.

"This does not mean that a bank can lend out $1,000 if someone deposits $100."(runeks)
Actually, they sure can.  If the $100 was cash, then this forms a part of their reserves.  They take the $100 cash from the depositor, and credit his account.  The $100 in cash is now the bank's asset, and the corresponding $100 deposit is the bank's liability.
If they loan $1,000, then this increases the bank's assets and liabilities by $1,000.  The loan ($1,000) is an asset, and the corresponding deposit it creates ($1,000) is a liability.  
Total assets are now $1,100 ($1000 loan + $100 cash), and total liabilites are $1,100 in deposits.  Reserve to deposit ratio is $100/$1,100 = 9% (ie. 9% of the banks deposits are now backed by cash on hand at the bank).
The money supply has increased by $1000 through the loan (was $100 in deposits, but now it's $1,100 in deposits).
The following link is a good start to understanding how basic bank accounting works, and how it relates to reserve requirements and the money supply.

Banks create deposits.  Of course they can't "lend out more than they have" because every loan creates a corresponding deposit.  Banks do not lend deposits, nor do they "multiply up" Central Bank created money.  The theory of deposit expansion has been totally debunked.  The following is from the Bank of England.
"This article explains how the majority of money in the modern economy is created by commercial
banks making loans.
• Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply
as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’
central bank money to create new loans and deposits."
The fact is that banks create money through loans.  Every loan creates a deposit, and every repayment of a loan destroys a deposit.  That is how the vast majority of money is created and destroyed.
