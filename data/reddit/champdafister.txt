Being "investigated". They are pulling some shit, if you ask me
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:18
Exactly. That is the problem as no one is going to do it for the benefit of the user.

If i had the money, resources, and knowledge to put together an exchange, i would do so in a heartbeat and call it UXchange. An exchange focused on providing the best experience for its users.

Waiting for Coinbase to send out a delay notification since bitcoin is picking up
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:05:08
Coinbase Buys/Sells being investigated. Fk'em.  Im sick of their bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:18:11
WE ARE GOING GREEN
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:21:44
Bitcoin isn't going back up until fees decrease significantly, which means we need more segwit and eventually lightning implementation.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:45:55
I guess that rules out Elon, considering they are driving a KIA...
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:19:19
Haha spot on.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:46:58
Bitcoin be like: 
Last night I took an L but tonight I bounce back
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:44:48
Expect a rebound after they expire.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:51:08
Indeed a good idea. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:34:51
I have tried. But I wiped them pretty clean and couldnt find anything. Very frustrated with myself right now, but its not the end of the world.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:45:41
It's like $2000 so Idk, guessing the cost of that wouldntbe worth it. If it were $200k I would be losing it.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:40:25
I will always have faith in crypto and Blockchain! It is the future. Hopefully I can utilize it in human factors research one day in developing user focused solutions for a variety of services and products.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:32:19
I had one, but for a different wallet unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-10-04 13:34:56
I went from ubuntu to windows fresh install, sp o had nothing unfortunately.

Why is Bitcoin SV in the green?
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:54:18
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:53:35
Oh man this is good.
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:57:42
Anyone see Thor coin with the 40,000% gain? Wtf.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:39:47
Came here for this

Investment firm says bitcoin value is zero: FUD. God damn lets get this price moving up
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:32:58
Jesus Christ people. At least they dealt with it quickly. Coinbase would've waited until next week to be like, oh, by the way...
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:35:16
Not gonna lie, they are doing a decent job of adapting to crypto and developing an understanding of it. It could be way worse.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:48:57
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:08:41
Just throwing this out there, people are much more financially conservative this tine if year because of taxes. They are thinking about money more consciously and thus probably wont invest as much. However, come tax refund time, im sure we will see cryptos pick up.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:25:21
Ugh such hope for a moment
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:50:17
Thanks, appreciate it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:48:41
Maybe this price decline will kill off some of the trash alts that people wasted money on.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:42:16
Okay, can someone tell me WTF Global Job Coin is? And how it has gone up 3000% in the last 24 hrs? Sounds like BS to me...
@_date: 2018-03-03 06:37:41
True. But then alts flew up big time. I have 2200 ADA bought at 0.09 and regret not selling when it pass $1...
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:08:41
Tell me that H stands for HODL
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:52:55
Price holding well considering the decline in stocks
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:48:08
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:19:43
Some will probably stay out, some will come back. Probably depends on what the trends are around that time.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:14:18
GG for today... New game tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-03-23 20:53:14
Why bother
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:44:31
Anyone have a good tutorial to installing it so i can dual boot windows as well?

Go clocked so hard he got up thinking he was still on the Saints.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:48:10
Just curious how/where to do so
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:21:22
Lol the unfortunate truth
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:33:00
Loved the end. BTC is.... Going to 100k. Killed me with the music buildup xD
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:12:18
How far is it going to go before a significant rebound
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:06:41
Nah, they'd never stop you from buying cigs and alcohol
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:10:10
Extended editions baby!
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:32:00
Someone should replace it with Elon Musk's car.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:29:23
Same. I refuse in fact, lol. There's no going back.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:09:00
HODL until you be like :
And then keep HODLING
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:01:25
Being in the field of psychology, I already look through this stuff and people... Well, are people.
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:28:55
Same here.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:50:35
Assumed as much. Just saw it on CMC and was like Wtf,
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:49:49
