A number of Bitcoin Cash supporters believe that Bitcoin Cash fits Satoshi's vision of Bitcoin more closely than Bitcoin and that, when forking, Bitcoin Cash was "restored" to the original intent of Bitcoin.  
The statement he made is nothing more than elitism and him feeling superior to Bitcoin users and trying to slight them in any way possible.  Bitcoin has a brand that Bitcoin Cash does not.  By being "the original", Bitcoin Cash supporters are trying to tap into Bitcoin's brand and steal their market - hence why the message continues to be pushed.
(Btw, I have held both BTC and BCH and don't care about the squabbles of either group.)

Agreed.  It's about branding.

I had an issue a few months ago where I had to get my bank involved.  It cost me another Bitcoin at $2400...

I think what he means is that he believes (as do I) that "Net Neutrality" is a false term that is intended to confuse the general populace and actually restricts technological development, free trade, and liberty.  This isn't a new tactic, with some of the more public Acts using this strategy being the Patriot/Freedom act - both of which intended to grab power and expand the reach of government, all the while using fear and HIGHLY unlikely scenarios as justification.

I'd be surprised.  I'll be surprised if we break 12k by then.

I was literally told this at $1800.

Bitcoin Nutsack.  Latest fork

Getting the government to place regulations on a market makes it better?  We should get the government to place lots more regulation on crypto.  Surely that will add lots of value!  /s

At least in my state, 75k is enough income to establish some serious savings/investments very quickly - if properly utilized.  I'd prioritize financial education and budgeting before anything else.  Having money is only half of the equation to wealth - what you do with it is the other half, the half that determines how long you have it.  
If your wife dislikes her job so much, you could always cash out some BTC to help her move towards something she does enjoy.  Of course, you'd have to explain where the money came from, but there have been a number of good solutions offered already.  If you choose to go this route, I'd view the money spent not only as a emotional investment, but as a financial one, as well.  The estimated ROI shouldn't be hard to calculate and could even be encouragement for your wife, as in instead of viewing her going to school/starting her own business as a loss of 25k/year + expenses, she sees it as a long term benefit financially.  If she thinks that way.  
Regardless of what you decide to do, this might be worth reading, as well.  Your wife's income would have more impact than the wife in this example, I'd think, but the principle is the same...

I agree with most of what you're saying, however I think the final price of BTC is so speculative, you never know.  In the (unbelievable) scenario that one coin is worth $10m, even one coin is enough.  
I'd say that if you put 100k in when it was at that 1800 mark, you'd be pretty well off right now.  That was moreso what I meant to imply with my earlier post - that it's not so much about price, but about return.  And when it comes to future ROI, who really knows?

You could probably buy/make some crazy-low seat if you've got the money for a lambo.  Let's keep the dream alive!

Don't feel too bad about it.  Most people's minds are made up until something else happens to change that opinion.  A few years ago, my dad wasn't pleased that I had invested in Bitcoin - he'd just get silent and say that any time he had tried to made an investment it had lost him money, believing the same would happen to me.  Now he's proud of my investment in Bitcoin and, unfortunately, I can't get him to quit telling people...

Going up (in this case the belief that Bitcoin's price will go up)

The general public won't accept Bitcoin until mass media tells them to.

I feel like we're in a state that could go either way (as if you can't make that statement all the time), though even if it's price goes down, I still feel good about the short term price.  I really do think this could be the beginning of a new bull run, though.  Mainstream media is itching to get people invested in the Bitcoin debate again - and breaking 10k is enough of a milestone for them to start biting.  Once that starts happening, combined with "the halvening" news, you're going to get a bunch of new speculators who have watched the last two bubbles pass them by throwing money into it.  These aren't going to be savvy investors, but people looking for that jackpot.  And think about how many people play the lottery.  But that's the widespread audience that investors want to see - we'll be breaking through sell-walls and everything will bubble up.  
Of course if things do go this route, when that bubble bursts you're going to have more "Bitcoin is a scam!" whining than ever before, but that's nothing new.  I donno - only time will tell, but I've got a good feeling about the next year of Bitcoin and I don't mind sharing those speculations publicly! ��

Yeah, it's gonna die at 30k.  /s
Of course it's gonna crash - that's what happens with any volatile asset.  But it also has the potential to skyrocket.  We aren't just talking about a price tag, we're talking about an idea and advancing technology.  I've been hearing "it's a scam, it's going to crash, it's dead" since $60.  All from people who have missed all the opportunities to better their lives and support something cool.  It's one thing to say "I don't believe in this investment" after having done research - and state your opinions why.  It's another to write it off because it's easier to do than study, think, and make an original opinion, whatever that opinion is.

Yeah, let's talk about it...
