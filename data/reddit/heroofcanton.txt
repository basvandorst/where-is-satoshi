Let's discuss it: If you dont think this model is a fit for the data, why? I really want to know, and I would appreciate hearing your comments without childish insults attached.

I dont know, my gut says we're seeing the bear trap, but we dont know the scale since we can only look backwards.

Huh, interesting. Are there any historical examples of what you're describing? Ill check out that video soon, I dont have audio at the moment. (Also I obviously didn't make that top graph, I just made the comparison. I dont know original author of it, but I originally saw it in a econ course.)

Really will spike even higher (40kUSD/BTC?), is what I meant to say in the title.

If you have to ask, then the answer is always "No."

Randomly pick another time period? And where did I say where we were? Thanks for your mature and thoughtful response.
If you cant talk like adult, just stop doing it, ok?

I think that it's not necessarily one or the other yet. I think that it is the bear trap, but could easily turn out to be fear/capitulation based on herd mentality. One of the reasons it has been climbing so quickly lately is because there are more and more ways to actually use it now. As people freak out at this moment, it could drive companies that were about to accept it to not, and other companies to not because the first company isn't, and so on. If that snowballs too quickly, I think it can sink bitcoin before it truly got going

No I did mean bear trap. But Im not sure and I think it's interesting, that's why I wanted to have a discussion about it. I didn't expect the hivemind in here to be so strong.
Why do you think we're in the bull trap vs bear trap?
