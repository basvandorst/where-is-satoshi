Not sure how smart that is, dude. If everyone thinks like this, there is no growth, just kids saying their pile of toys is the best.

Arbitrary amount of X has more value than arbitrary amount of Y! People, rejoice!

Woulnd’t Litecoin hit the same issues when it becomes as popular as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:07:10
Wasn't there a special comittee created in the US to regulate banks after the crash?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:04:29
We need a bigger one. Not for the profits, but to shake some weak hands and a bit of the hype. It’s nicer around here with less “oh look at the price” noise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:48
Wasn’t ETH clogged up with kittens for the past few weeks?
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:31:03
Are you on a segwit address?
@_date: 2014-10-13 10:34:48
Since Bitcoin price is governed by suppy and demand, what is the ration now between easy of buying Bitcoin and ease (or opportunity) of spending. I've heard many saying that the price has gone down because of merchants accepting Bitcoin and immediately converting to fiat. Is this true?
@_date: 2014-10-13 11:38:34
We should comment on the article itself, not only here.
@_date: 2014-12-04 08:17:44
Cool. Post back here when you have more info up.
@_date: 2014-12-03 13:00:12
Harcore user of Kraken here and I'd recommend them w/o hesitating.
@_date: 2014-11-01 10:01:47
Please make that wallet address in plain text. I'd like to copy-paste it.
@_date: 2014-11-08 12:14:30
It says "virtual in-game Bitcoins". Doesn't sound legit
@_date: 2014-12-03 10:20:13
does the link work for you guys? 
@_date: 2014-12-03 16:37:30
You guys need much more than 1 statement and 1 office address to prove credibility. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 11:09:53
where is this, exactly?
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:18:53


I see.
@_date: 2015-05-29 13:03:48
Yeah. They are almost in every major city.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:50:36
Cool. Any idea if the entire stack for the forks BCH and SegWit2x is also open source?
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:18:50
mBTC seems fine, so 1 mBTC ~= $4 or we can have killoSats, for $0.4
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:04:07
whoa dude, one full BTC? *jelly*
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:37:41
That's not healthy, dude. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:24:02
As reasonable as that sounds, this won't make anyone feel better.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:22:16
I find this hard to believe and it smells like the usual HBO marketing machine at work.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:59:05
Who did you pay that fee to? The Bitcoin network or to the exchange that sold you the BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:49:27
Thanks for pointing this out. We need more fine folks like you...
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:27:13
eToro has quite a few posters with crypto-currencies around London.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:34:37
No need for sarcasm...
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:56:55
Terminal as an ATM? As cool as they are, most have massive fees, so Bitcoin is not the blame there.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:40:44
Bitcoin Cash? Why? Is this a misunderstanding? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:28:36
Found the naswer in the comments. Apparently this bank was already offering Bitcoin and will now offer Bitcoin Cash too. Nice way of doubling their funds.
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:51:25
Stripe should be super cool. Any place to market shares for these Bitcoin payment proccesors?
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:56:52
How do I know how many bytes and I sending?
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:21:03
Do you know the company of the ATM or the software it was running? Just curios, as most of the ATMs I encountered simply mark up the BTC price by a few good %
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:43
Blockchain itself is a rather broad topic.
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:32:01
As long as you're menally prepared to lose it all, you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:22:43
I always does.
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:34:14
Did you not read the article? It states this fairly clearly.
@_date: 2015-09-12 13:54:33
will the new site import the old wallets?
@_date: 2015-09-10 09:48:52
As much as I care about privacy, that's not enough of a political platform to run a country.
@_date: 2015-03-09 10:59:24
why does an BTM have open hours? Shouldn't it be 24/7?
@_date: 2017-07-10 13:55:30
off topic: anyone has any experiences with Bitwala in the UK? Can you use the Visa card at any highstreet shop?
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:35:58
Doesn't Xapo (and a few others. There was a startup from Berlin, but I forgot their name.) already do this?
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:06:49
Bitwalla, that was the one. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:05:33
abitsky.com looks great? Has anyone tested them? 
Their prices are a bit annoying. Why don't they just use mBTC? 0.0something is unpleasent to read.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:43:01
you must give some context to this...
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:29:38
So no VAT on Bitcoin purchases? Or is "consumption tax" something else?
@_date: 2017-07-05 09:45:47
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:56:46
wicked job!
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:55:37
Great visual guide!
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:24:15
Quite a few options and buttons in this UI, but the direction is great.
