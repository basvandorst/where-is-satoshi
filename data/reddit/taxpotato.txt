I'm in the UK and I use both services for some small investments in GBP.
They seem to be OK; I've made two small purchases using a debit card, once using the blockchain website and once using the iOS app and they've both gone through. The second did take a couple of hours to complete though, but that's simply due to the volume of people buying right now.
I've also completed the "KYC" (Know Your Customer) verification where you take a photo of your driving license or similar ID and send it to them (Coinify) to allow for further purchases. I did have to open a support call with them after a few days but I can imagine they're snowed under at the moment. Within a few hours someone had replied to that ticket and I was 'approved' without fuss.
Also, make sure to go through the blockchain.info account pages to setup 2FA (Google Authenticator) and the other security things.
Naturally, even though they let you write down the recovery words for your keys, you don't actually own your keys so be sure to follow the general advice on this subreddit of only keeping small (for whatever value 'small' is to you) amounts in your blockchain.info wallet, and transfer the rest to something more secure.
The only thing I've really noticed is that the Coinify/Blockchain exchange rates seem to be somewhat lower at any given point in time than GDAX/Coinbase. EG: The blockchain app right now is saying $15,015 while GDAX is saying $15640. I guess this is fine for buying, but not so good for selling. YMMV.

I believe you could, although you're at the mercy of transaction fees at that point (although I suspect those would be absorbed by the increase in selling price).
My understanding is that GDAX doesn't do BTC-&gt;GBP conversions though, so you still need to go from $ to £ somehow, which may add on another fee.

OK, I've answered my own question. Coinify have started passing on the Bitcoin Transaction Fee to customers, as per 
This confused me slightly as this only went into effect on the 30th November, the day after my previous purchase where said transaction fee was covered by Coinify.
For anyone else, this is what you should see in the confirmation email you get sent after the transaction:
    Item				Quantity	Price	Amount
    Bitcoins ordered by customer	0.00256154
    Bitcoin processing fee		1		0.0	0.00022784 BTC

    Payment processing fee		1		0.75	0.75 GBP
 
    Subtotal	25.75 GBP
    Total		25.75 GBP
    Amount paid	25.75 GBP
