Boy a lot of dumb replies from people who think they know. 
Pretty sure 1 mil is not much anymore this post is totally legit. 
How do u think all these ICOs get so much early success? How do u think we've arrived at having over 840 currencies? 
Do u people seriously think that theres a few bad investors out there who just haven't been lucky or maybe you actually think these people are stupid and that you're smart because you HODL bitcoin and think you know the technology. 
Truth is there is A TON of people out there who are losing massive amounts of $$ with cryptocurrencies. There are gamblers EVERYWHERE gambling in anything its like a drug and its been going on since the beginning of time. 
Its like when my friends text me stuff like yoooooo check out this new coin its up 20%, 40%, 60%, 150% whatever. I tell them the only reason why theyre texting me about shitcoins is because bitcoin hasnt done anything in 3 days. Its crazy how much people are constantly checking up the market and talking about prices and yet when the price doesnt go up for a day or 2 they get bored and start researching these other coins yet bitcoin is up A TON so everybody needs to TAKE a lesson out of this post and just relax and HODL.

Once you've downloaded the Bitcoin core software you won't actually have to do anything. As long as the software is open it will be working as a full time node until you close it. 
This means that your computer runs the software that tells your computer how to verify and propagate the block that "it" (your full node) thinks is the truth and therefor has the right to be added on the tip of the blockchain as the new block.
But before even getting there the core software will need to download the complete history of the blockchain which further enforces the history and the decentralization of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:45:57
Running full nodes keeps the network honest and decentralized.

I think this behaviour is normal. People hardly understand BTC and they are subjected to all of these contradicting news and discussions. They don't understand all of the technical aspects so they base their beliefs on smart peoples opinions. 
There will always be FUD where there is interest and risk involved. Bashing people over their worries IMO is creating FUD out of FUD and is not helping. 
If you are someone who understands the technicalities of bitcoin, why waste time complaining about people being scared when you could actually help them understand. 
I myself have introduced a few people into bitcoin and it took a lot of time and patience to get them into it and I think thats what everyone should do and keep doing.
If everyone brings a new person into bitcoin then we instantly double the traffic. Isn't that what its all about at this stage?

And yet here I am. Ur point? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:53:49
2X will most probably create a 3rd coin (99% sure) but it really doesnt matter and isnt gonna change much because core got segwit and thats all we needed for the futur upgrades. 
Miners will get their 2x but whos going to code LN, schnorr and mast for them on the new chain? Core has all the full nodes. 
Core is paving the way and their doing it in the best possible way. We dont need bigger block sizes right now because we are far from mass adoption everyone should just be HODLING and waiting for core to its thing.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:06:49
Hmm well I'll take a stab at it lemme know if I'm wrong.
The 2x miners want to switch to bigger blocks because it is more profitable for them and as such it will be more profitable for them, but in the beginning. 
Once the difficulty adjusts on the longer original chain, (assuming it will take longer to mine because the hashrate will be gone) the 2x miners will switch back to the original chain, the chain where all the core nodes are using. 
Am I close?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:17:31
Forks happens when there is enough consensus. If there is not enough consensus the blocks get orphaned. Forks happen all the time

This post is exactly what I had been thinking. The unconfirmed transactions are rising and rising, making the fees higher, and its definitely not helping when AntPool is mining empty blocks. 
This Bcash thing is worse than we thought especially when miners have the opportunities to collude together and manipulate the difficulties by choosing to mine a specific chain or not. 
I don't understand why difficulty adjustments happen every 2016 blocks instead of in real time? Wouldn't it be better if the difficulty would adjust itself more directly when the hashpower leaves so that we're not mining blocks every 20 minutes instead? Cant core do something about this?
Also, does this mean that there is more room for new miners? Now that they're mining on 2 different chains it could mean that we need more hashpower to fill up the missing hashpower that constantly hops out of the legacy chain?
Whats the risk that segwit doesn't actually do enough of what we need before people get tired of all the unconfirmed transactions and higher fees? I mean look at all the noobs who get into Bitcoin when they hear that transactions are fast and cheap and when they actually use it and see whats happening now they will just leave and say its broken. 
**I mean I'm really ok with supporting core and letting them do their thing but this looks like real shit to me right now. Huge backlog, miners driven by profit get to hop chains and manipulate the difficulties, even AntPool mining empty blocks... price of BCH not going anywhere it seems and lol another hard fork in November... noobs will come over to bitcoin use it and see it doesnt do cheap and fast transactions and they'll say its broken and will disappear.**

I have lost 100K going through the same thing and I know other ppl who have lost more and its unfortunate because I had been told about these Bittrex phising sites yet I still got caught and the reason why I got caught is because I wasn't paying attention and used Google and clicked on the 1st website in the list (which at the time I always assumed that the 1st would always be the real one) and I also checked the browser link which said Secure,  and I was convinced it was the real site... 
But really it was bilttrex.com and it would only show in the browser for a second before being redirected to a perfect copy of the original website... and when I'd go on google again and click on the 1st link it would actually be the real site so I really don't know how this works.
Its sad but its done and theres nothing u can do about it. It feels like theres something more going on, like its a really well elaborated phising site and I wish I had known about it.

In a 30mins conference in front of a bunch of newbies I'd say its better to be arrogant and say "this is why Bitcoin is awesome, trust me". 
To me Andreas is more like a person thats handing out very nice flyers in the airport which is good because essentially people should be learning about Bitcoin on their own using multiple tools and resources.

This is a cool question and something I often think about. I would definitely go with the red pill because I think no amount of money is equal to or worth "youth" especially if u get to go back to a kid with all the knowledge that u have now. Think about how different ur life could've been had u known certain things at a younger time. 
Kids are fast thinking and full of pulsions and through time as they grow up they become more thoughtful and knowledgable and strategical. We grow up to be this way because of our survival instincts. Were observing intelligent people reach higher standards of living and we wanna do the same. 
If u could go back to as a kid with the knowledge u have now u could be unstoppable

It seems to me that even though Bitcoin is resilient to attacks, the applications around it are not and as a person who is not very tech savy this is very scary. 
I once lost a lot of Bitcoins because of something similar and things like this will keep happening and there will always be new ways for the scums to steal our money and all it really takes is one mistake to lose a lot of money. 
We need to work together and keep each other aware on whats going on because the new users are typically not aware of hardware wallets until they have used an exchange and joined a Bitcoin community or seen an ad. So newbies are very much at risk to lose their very first bitcoins which are worth so much right now and when a newb loses their first bitcoins they will most likely never get back into it and talk shit about it...
