Wasn’t coordinated. Was bitmain announcing a batch of miners. They only accept bch so everyone was liquidating so they can get some more s9’s. Sold out before the end of the day.  Coinbase should have announced the day they were going to debut the cash wallet.

good analogy.

Just because something is profitable doesn't mean it's relevant to the global community

so long as the number of buyers = number of sellers. if there are more sellers than buyers the price should go down in proportion.

unless you have a massive farm then its more profitable to solomine. all 25 coins per block found go to you. nearly $25k per block? ya that'd be worth it with a large enough farm you can be larger than some pools currently are.

unless they announced a new policy then they're not. i haven't received any notices from them about new policies but i have definitely lost money due to disputes where customers can do a bank request and get their money back and paypal confirmed with me that regardless of ebay's policies or category listings the sale is for an item that they will not offer seller protections. until paypal updates their policies you can and will get scammed by anyone purchasing non-refundable items on ebay. they'll get the item and then get their money back and you'll be screwed.
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:45:09
you sure about that?
don't limit your thinking about solo mining to what you could afford to run on your own.

Yes he acted but not all actors are idiots. Granted a lot of them are but when he was in school he was going for biochemical engineering. Not exactly something a 'dumb jock' signs up for when they enroll in college.

Don't forget that the early termination fee is paid for by you turning in your phone. If your phone is worth more than early termination then its up to you which is more valuable. Your choice in carrier or reselling your phone at the end of your contract.

Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
@_date: 2014-01-13 14:46:19
Sounds like someone at paypal doesn't understand the distinction between a bitcoin miner and bitcoin so they just banned both until someone internally corrected them.

But were those 40 new people adding to their already existing salary budget or were those people current employees that were just working on a different task than their normal daily tech activities? If they're already employees then its not a 'real' expense per say since its doubtful their already existing daily tasks would have increased their revenue as much as dedicating them to implement bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:20:50
yup. that's what i meant but not what I typed. heard that the 40 people were actually coinbase employees so the cost of implementation may not have been spent by overstock at all
@_date: 2014-01-20 16:56:01
maybe i'm naive but here's my thoughts. currently there are bitcoins being 'made' with each new block being discovered much like paper money being printed. the more paper is printed the more inflation the market will experience because more currency was added even though no added value was given to the new paper that was just printed. so if the value of bitcoin is staying stable and/or rising while coins are still being mined then the market demand is currently outpacing the designed inflation rate. once all coins are mined the only thing that would determine the value of the coin is demand since supply is already maxed out and if anything will only decrease with random people losing hardware, forgetting passwords, and basically just losing their own coins.

Make sense. Just hadn't seen it in use before.

isn't that how everyone reacted to email and .com's? blissful ignorance? "i'm not sure how they work but i know they exist. lol. isn't my tech ignorance funny?!!"

You're assuming everyone that got bitcoin wanted to convert it back over to fiat.
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:37:39
you mean there are activities that are more profitable than facebook or reddit? TIL

The issue isn't eBay, it's paypal. They don't recognize the currencies as having value so buyers are still able to and continue to request bank refunds/dispute purchases and get their money back after receiving the items.

Just curious. Why does kraken use XBT for bitcoin and not BTC?

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ cash out one more coin?
@_date: 2017-01-05 01:11:51
People also react with FOMO so they will have major amounts of cash or coin in an exchange attempting to day trade. Makes for very rich banks to hack into and rob.
