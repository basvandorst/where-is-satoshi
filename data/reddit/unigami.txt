Would I have the same level of security if I installed Xubuntu in a partition on my windows laptop instead of on a separate machine?

Thanks!  Figured this was a good time to learn how to tip too - hope this works!

oh...thx...I was looking for it on the Purchase Info page.

IIRC the two deposits to my account appeared within 3 days.

I don't see any mention of Bitcoin on the website...?

Thanks!  I might add that I installed this on an old XP machine that I use at work and it runs fine. In fact, I just tried playing a YouTube video and it plays great - I've been having problems with audio stuttering in both Chrome and Firefox, but on Cycle it plays perfectly.  And thanks for the BTC!

Have you thought about trying a hypnotist?

Thanks to this sub-reddit, I was aware of this and immediately sent an email asking for it to be reviewed.  That was 6 days ago and I have not heard back yet....

Very nice looking browser!  I installed the Coinbase app but then I got too frightened to log in and expose my password. Can you tell us how the security works with this type of browser?

ask on r/hypnosis

I've heard of police using hypnotists to help witnesses to crimes remember details.  I have not idea if it works but it is worth investigating!
