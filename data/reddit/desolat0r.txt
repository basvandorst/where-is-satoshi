How do you know this? After a big consolidation period a breakout is expected but the direction is unknown, also aren't descending triangles supposed to be bearish most of the time?

Both things can happen at once since the market is a fractal, the bigger downwards breakout can have a smaller upper breakout inside it if you zoom out.

This is not Forbes, it's their bullshit blog where they allow any idiot to publish their trash articles for $$ (not that their normal Forbes articles are much better but still).

That's something I always wondered, if most people follow basic technical analysis then how it actually works? If most buy at certain obvious support levels how can price continually move up after this, who are those people buying at the middle of support and the next resistance up?

From what you're saying your friend doesn't sound like an intelligent person but a *parrot*.

This didn't answer my question though, at all.

Reminds me of some people who believe in God even though they truly don't just in case he exists so they don't go to hell lmao.

If they couldn't handle the extra users then they should have closed registrations for the time being.

I disagree. Money management and risk reward are important, but without a clear and consistent edge on the market you won't be able to make any money.

A big percentage of this sub unironically thinks that.

I don't care about what political or economical views my doctor has as long as he fixes me up good.

This is not true.

Most people here though advocate hodling and that is definitely not trading.

The only way to answer a question like this is by having access to a set of universes lol.

So from this imagine you allude that bitcoin is going to go up?
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:04:28


Can you explain how someone can get rich with just HODLing? Are you talking about people who have bought below 1k?

...How can a bart pattern actually help a trader? To me it does the exact opposite, no matter if you went long or short it hits both stop losses (up or down) and everybody loses.

It's just grilled protein so yes, why wouldn't it be? If you are concerned with minimizing the calories from it just don't eat the pure fat on the edges.

This only says that the more time a technology exists the higher the probability it will exist even longer. This doesn't imply that the price of BTC will go up, only that will not be rendered obsolete fast.
