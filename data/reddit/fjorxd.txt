Thanks for the correction and will save your comment for future arguments. But doesn't change much in my reasoning and point. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:40:35
The entire purpose in your opinion. Important difference. The blockchain can have many different purposes. 
However it's true that a completely centralized system can easily be made. Database it's called. But a increase in blocksize will not make bitcoin centralized. Maybe, maybe a bit more than it is now. The entire world doesn't have Lukejr internet connection and harddrive space. And the entire word doesn't need to have a complete blockchain on their harddrives. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:00:58
You saying that it is an unacceptable solution is not a reason. Would like to know why you think it's unacceptable. 
And we don't have any other solution as of now. The miners may come around. Most other BIPs are not even made yet. And not at all tested. BIP 101 is made and tested. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:11:12


Bull shit. Show me a bit of proof and I might believe you. 


Sure, that I believe. But is that your reason why it's unacceptable. Or are you just saying that they find it unacceptable? 
 &gt; It's unacceptable to a supermajority of miners.
Well, most miners wants bigger blocks but just not BIP 101. Almost all miners wants bigger blocks. So I really don't find your reason solid. I ask again. Why so you find BIP 101(and bigger blocks) unacceptable? 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:34:33
Why not implement a scaling solution that works years ahead. 4MB will postpone it a couple of years but you will no matter what need another hardfork to deal with the problem. Hardforks ain't easy so we need a solution that works years ahead. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:31:18
Who wants a solution where we pay more fees than the current banking system.. Not me and not most users. Scale now or look back on bitcoin as the first but not current version of the primary blockchain.. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:26:46


How does that sentence make sense? Does multiple blockchains not scale or does bitcoin blockchain not scale at all? 


You might not like how it is scaling bitcoin but it's literally scaling bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:28:58
SW will **only** double the max amount of transactions that we currently have. That is not a solution that will work in 2017. Maybe not even til the end of 2016. SW is great. Don't get me wrong.. But lets scale while it's relative easy. BIP 101 is the best solution yet. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:58:34
It's not about if it's doable to hardfork once or twice. It's about the fact that it ain't easy and the bigger the network the more people need to make a decision about the fork. Relative few people are mining 75% of the network now. That might be the case in 4 years or not. That is my point and not that it isn't doable twice. Big difference. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:23:09
How is that an answer to my questions? It's just a chart where a few mining pools are saying they don't like BIP 101? Most of them support bigger blocks though? How is that not what I said? 
And I see no technical pros. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:37:13
Unless you(or anyone else) find a scaling solution that works without changing the blocksize, that is the only solution. SW was great but not enough. We need more space and BIP 101 and XT is a solution that is ready. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:08:34
Well it isn't completely empty gesture since some banks might crash(not all) and therefore pay the bank user the 75k. Denmark lost one bank back before the last economic crisis. Everyone with an account there got paid up to 100.000 euros. 
This payback feature is a think to help mainly the small banks. No one wants an account in a small bank or a bank that needs customers if they might lose every cent they own. 
Not a fan of the current bank setup but don't hate this part of it...

@_date: 2014-12-22 13:31:07
Short answer: Someday yes
A bit longer: I don't think you can do it yet, but it's one of the scalability ways. Can't find the link where I read about it some months ago, but I'll guess it will be a part of the future. 
Instead of analyzing the network I would presume that you just download the newest blocks(transactions). Maybe? ;-)

When bitcoin takes off they will come. I don't see a need rush bitcoin adoption in every business right now. 
Before we get the mainstream adoption we all want, there need to be a easy way to buy and store the coins. Which there isn't yet, at least not a save and easy version for the less tech savvy. 
There are hundreds of bitcoin startups and a handful of those will make bitcoin gain mainstream adoption. At least that's my opinion.

Lame title.. 
Only half true. It's a danish fund to help new businesses, and it's partly supported by the Danish government. So true that the government is giving money to this bitcoin startup, but the government have no influence of the choosing of startups. 
And the Danish government have no interest in bitcoin so far. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 12:35:09
Yeah, true. However if you go to or one of the subreddits connected to DNM, you will get the impression that is was the owner, not FBI. 
They state that he also payed of other people in the 8-9 months the site was running. And one of those people was a server admin, who was a undercover cop. 
But we still need information to confirm this. But can't see a reason for the FBI to pay the undercover cop with bitcoins?

You clearly hate goverments really much, however in this case when it's just money and no influence to the startup, and therefore the help from the goverment is a good thing. 
Even if you have a great idea, it requires alot of money to start up a business, and that is why the goverment support startups.

Well, circle is a lot like coinbase but it's available in more countries(or some countries where coinbase isn't available). And I think the most people use it because they require less personal info about you than coinbase.
In the beginning it looked like they had lower fees, but it's more or less the same as coinbase. And circle won't cancel your order if price rise or fall quickly. 
But some people prefer circle and others coinbase.

Nobody said inflation was the *only* reason for the falling price. I'm sure it's a part of it together with downward pressure from people using and not rebuying. 
And the 1000+$ price was over hyped, and makes the price prop look even more crazy. I'm just waiting it out, til when there is a lower inflation and user adoption is larger.

Because gold, silver and other rare materials drop in value, when wall street believe in their own system = dollars. So every time US have good financial news, gold drops. And bad financial news makes people go back to more "secure" investments as gold.

Since bitcoin can't handle micro payments right now, I would argue that changetip is helping bitcoin adoption.

Well I guess Satoshi chose the high inflation in the beginning, so bitcoin could fast become more stable. Sure, there is a massive downwards pressure right now, but give it some time and the low inflation will come and a more stable coin will come aswell.

Nobody care about ip or the technology behind the email but it's an amazing service and everybody use it now. People don't need to know all the bitcoin info, like people don't know what the Internet is. 
Edit: The confidence in the USD is somewhat resorted, but not currencies like euro or ruble. And there isn't any trust in PayPal. You still give them way to much info, and one hack can give the wrong people everyone's data and payment info.

Well. First the 0.66% is transaction fee. If you want to change to your local currency, that is an extra fee. This is a business and they need revenue. 
Bitcoin got a too high transaction fee right now to handle micro transactions(guess that's the amount they are gonna send). Bitcoin is far away from that scenario. But could happen?

I agree that there is some big players and that it had a bigger role. But in my opinion it's still one of the main reasons for the low price. Not the only reason but part of it. There is not really any reason to use bitcoin atm(a few places) and therefore no users. The current inflation is massive compared to any other currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:02:10
Banks loan out money and get let's say 2%, and pay you 1% for borrowing your money. You get a piece of their action... If coinbase want to do it, they can easily do that same with bitcoins. Loan bitcoin to someone and pay you a bit since they use your bitcoins.

A agree with you in most of your statements. However if bitcoin reaches a price where it gets a certain stability then there wouldn't be a need to transform bitcoin to local currency. Then bitcoin is the payment to buy chicken and sell your sheeps. 
Bitcoin can't compete with m-pesa now or in the near future. But it can give a bank and currency to all the other countries without a m-pesa solution.

Since this is [the alternative to bitcoin]( (Danish text but easy to see the large 0.5$ fee). I would argue that bitcoin is the best option right now, even though it's not ready for it. 
Edit: That's why we got companies like changetip. 
The TechCrunch article you quote is about the transaction fee, and you talk about the scalability issues bitcoin got. The transaction fee is much lower with bitcoin and that's why it's recommended by TechCrunch. Bitcoin is however not ready yet but there are more that one way to fix scalability issues.

Got my vote sir. Gonna add a bit. Someday when bitcoin addresses isn't a long string of numbers and letters but a more recognizable address(like random words or a even self chosen name address). Remember this is still early adoption and alot will change over the years. 
And as you say. A third party payment system build on top of the bitcoin protocol could also make it harder to make address mistakes.

Nobody understand the current payment solutions and got a blind trust at visa etc. It's the same with the Internet and the protocol behind emails.

It is just like any other exchange but this one is now the first regulated in US. It's a big deal since no bull whale will send dollars to an anonymous exchange in eastern Europe. Now Wall Street and any other US citizen can buy bitcoins secure and cheap. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:23:54
I'm excited about them since they support this community and helps bitcoin reach its potential. A second regulated exchange is good and can challenge coinbase a bit. 
The ETF makes it easy to invest in bitcoin, like it is easy to invest in gold. 
And they own 1% of all coins and are hodling. 
These are all three good reasons to be excited about them and what they do.

Well in this case we allow it because the blockchain only can process 7 transactions per second, and he is working on a solution that can process 20 times as much. 
And by allow I mean most people will agree to the update, since everyone can 'update' the protocol.

Alright then I will answer in peace. Money is not digital now, thou it might seem so. It is being handled by your banks but it is an old system and cost lots of money. That's why we got so high fees. 
Bitcoin is volatile now because it is mainly being used by speculators. Bitcoin can mature to be more stable. Your own currency is volatile aswell but people don't notice it. Euro/dollar 20% drop in no time/and inflation. 100$ dollars 50 years ago is not 100$ today.

We don't know. 
However the idea is that there is enough transaction fees in every block to pay the miners. Let's say this is gonna happen in 10 years. By then mining equipment could be 100x more efficient and therefore the fees can pay for it. But maybe not? We don't know, but this is the idea. Block reward is only here to distribute wealth and ensure the blockchain in the early years(my thoughts no real truth).

@_date: 2015-01-25 12:39:56
First off it's 3 transactions per second in reality and theoretical 7. 
The fee is to pay the miners to pick up our transactions and if we include more transactions in one block the miners get more money. So we could lower the fee. So when Gavins makes headers 20mb instead of 1mb, we can include more transactions(if we get the users to make them) and the fee could get lower. Savvy? ;-)

It means absolutely nothing! ;-) 
The miners will keep mining as long as it's profitable and it still is. Some invested millions in hardware and won't stop cus the price drops 30$. Another reddit user showed us yesterday that they need to sell 40% of all coins to pay the bills. That means that it's still highly profitable for them to mine(hardware aside), and the price can even go alot lower. There is no direct correlation between hashrate and price. Not direct anyways ;-) 
Hope it helps?

Well maybe you are somewhat correct. The US dollar seem to be digging its own grave with huge debt and QE(1, 2 &amp; 3). So maybe we will see a new currency remove dollars from its thrown.

It makes no sense to compare bitcoins value to a company. 
And since everyone knows when the halving will come, the price will already be corrected after it. So nothing will happen around that time, however a 5% inflation(in stead of 11%) will remove some of the downward pressure there is at the moment. 
Edit: Try next time. They enjoy this stuff.

Thanks for the answer. Will check it out. Any chance you know about EU customs on gold/silver?

Your bitcoin reddit picture in the right bottom corner could need a redesign ;-) Anyway nice design and sweet info. 500 bits private 
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:41:32
Like the layout and seems easy to get around. However the share buttons kinda capture the focus away from the three reasons to use bitcoin. 
Also you tend to favor coinbase over BitPay? Maybe? 
Anyway thanks for your site! 500 bits @_date: 2015-01-10 20:28:25
I know that circle is giving away free coins, but don't know about the second one.

Are you talking about Gemini the exchange or the bitcoin ETF? 
Gemini is rumored to go live 1st quarter of 2015. And no news on the ETF. 
Edit. Since you talk about IPO I guess you are talking about the ETF called COIN. They say they can't tell anything about it. They said it at the ETF conference last Monday. So no news. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 10:41:37
Yeah, I know! :) I just like all the attention we as a community can make. And we need attention to this problem. You earned the small tip.

All these miners currently support Classic:
* Bitmain/Antpool
* BitFury
* BW.COM
* HAOBTC.com
* KnCMiner
* Genesis Mining
* Avalon Miner
All these miners openly support Classic and a larger blocksize, and does this to profit. I.e. they believe that it's not *insane* to switch to Classic.
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:44:02
Well, as much as I support Bitcoin. I also support my country Denmark. This is only a law to help pay the bills it costs to welcome refugees. It ain't cheap. The rest of the danish citizens also need to pay their own way in life before they can get welfare from the danish government. This is just fair game for all.
Bitcoin is great. Don't get me wrong. But don't be a douche and abuse the good nature of Denmark.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:25:57
Yes, the future is looking great once we get away from Core. They have no blocksize raise in their plans. Classic is the way to go for now. Segregated witness is a great possibility but would rather see some work into thinblocks. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:15:58
Well, if you want your fees to keep in the 1 - 8 cents range, we need bigger blocks. Otherwise you will have a fee market where fees are much more.

Alot in that article is somewhat or completely wrong. Bitstamp is not a UK based exchange, and there is no proof that the *big* price drop caused anything(and 50$ price drop is not really anything in the bitcoin world). 
Typical media making everything sounds much more horrible than it is at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:10:26
Lies are lies. Spreaing FUD through comments or pictures serve the same purpose. That's why we now have two bitcoin communities. But somehow no one here talks about core dev lies? 
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:20:54

Why does your link show about 13k notes and all other sites show about 6k notes? Why is there such a big difference?
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:57:54
Was guessing it ignored fewer nodes since it got a higher number but what kinda nodes do bitnodes ignore and why? Because the notes doesn't relay/receive transactions or because they are on a too slow network? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 11:19:50
It seems like there is a lot of joking in this thread Want kinda stories are you looking for? Bitcoin startups that can change the way we trade, like Open Bazaar? or us that try to donate bitcoins to charities and the people on The new bitcoin XT hardfork?
Comment if you want some more info and what kinda stories you are looking for.

Well, the cap doesn't prevent spam, it only fills up the mempool? The cap is only slowing down how fast the spam get through.

Since they will never pick it up(and they only got 7 days to do so) it's really not a waste. AND he need to raise his limit before he can tip $50. $20 is the standard limit. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 09:42:51
Annd why is this relevant to a bitcoin subreddit? Almost all of Europe already got a similar law. Denmark got a cash payment limit about $3.000. It's just to avoid money-laundering. Remember cash is anonymous payment unlike Bitcoin.

One: Stop using all caps. Two: Make a title that makes sense. Three: Bitcoins are one word, don't try to make it into two. 
And to answer your question. Check the blockchain. You can do that on blockchain.info 
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:39:44
1 mBTC is like 24 cents.. That would make bitcoin way to expensive to use. You can just raise your own fee to avoid waiting in mempool. Right now they are just paying the miners a nice easy amount of bitcoin through fees. 
Bitcoin can easily handle spam and it ain't cheap to spam anyway. 
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:47:24
Maybe this belongs to ;)

The Internet providers in the US are using the naturally occurring monopoly to provide bad connections and raising the cost. Europe got that handled and most people can easily afford a good connection. 
I really hope that Google fiber can turn it around for you.

If your bitcoins are 'off chain' you therefore don't own your bitcoins(control the private key). Changetip is a great tool, but don't use it as a wallet. 
Bitcoins off chain are just numbers being moved round on a central ledger. Don't use that for large amounts. One wallet error on the wallet holding all the bitcoins off chain and it's all gone. See MtGox for more info.

Keep the sharing going! 2000 bits @_date: 2015-09-11 14:55:12
Unless you live in a 3rd world country, we got big enough HDDs and  fast enough internet connection. I got a couple of TB and a 100/100 connection. I can easily handle 20 mb blocks right now.
@_date: 2015-09-14 14:35:14
I don't think you quite understand what you are talking about. Google and all other companies still leak private data sometimes, but it's quite another thing with bitcoins. 
If you want money and bitcoins 'off chain' then there are no use for bitcoins. Just have YourNameHereCoin and have them off chain. Off chain bitcoins are not really your bitcoins(or even there). and welcome to a **fractional reserve banking system.**

This price jump shows perfectly why 1mb blocks ain't enough. Transactions stuck in mempool are not what we need. I'm tired of telling people that they need to raise their fee. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:56:05


Yes, of cause it will.


Do you think that within 10 minutes(avg) there are going to be zero new transactions? We don't need a large mempool to keep it going. First of all, the block reward is not going away any time soon and the avg. amount of transactions is going up. More fees. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:52:17
Nice that they didn't use a graph showing the price bubble of 2013. A 200/300$ price jump seems small compared to a 1100$ mountain. Either show what they did or log scale! Thumbs up.

I tried to picture a way to make that work but came up short.
The only reason a government like US could keep the gold price at the same value over a long period of time was because of laws. The general population couldn't own gold, so prices wouldn't change. 
The equation needed to make a apple cost 1mbit all the time is impossible. I would say? The data needed is large and only a clever future AI would be able to handle it? ;-) maybe?

The hate for changetip is misguided right now. Since the blockchain can't handle micro transactions or/and more than 3 per second. We sadly need a 3rd party like Changetip right now. 
But hopefully the blockchain can handle it in the near future. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:20:50
You are right. The purpose was not to keep gold prices at the same but to give value to the currency. Every 20$ bill is worth 20$ gold. 
Only a government can make a peg as told above. Both between a commodity/currency and currency/currency.
