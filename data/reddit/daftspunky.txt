Not all MLM schemes are scams. Most of them are, but not all. To tar them all with the same brush is to create missed opportunity. Many would dismiss Bitcoin in 2009/10 for this same reason. Try thinking for yourself, or at the very least don't criticize or patronize others for it.

Here's my guess: it will be a centralized layer that sits on top of bitcoin, with a public API, that allows systems like MegaUpload and Brave to record micro transactions sent to users, stored in a "cache". Once a user's cache reaches a certain threshold, coins are sent to them as a legit bitcoin transaction.
Simple. And also quite genius.
TL;DR - reward points layer for bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-08-01 03:39:11
Glad to see someone here is capable to think for themselves. As far as I can tell, the shady part is the fact that there is no listing on coinmarketcap.com. Meaning it's not a "real" crypto, it's not public or anything, they are no different to PayPal at this point. They may be fixing this in October with a "new blockchain".
Nothing points to it being a scam, YET, and crypto currency as a product pairs incredibly well with MLM schemes because it is essentially 100% margin. In other words, the product doesn't need to be over priced to feed the tree structure. You could say it is a match made in heaven.
I'm on board with the idea, however, not the execution. As soon as I saw their "XCOINX" [exchange FAQ was cut and paste from Bitstamp]( that was a complete deal breaker. It shows they are making it up as they go along.

It is a difference of opinion. Not everyone has all day to read every comment, so they will scan the contents to find comments "worthy" (i.e high scoring) of their attention. This is the only reason I use reddit. The core concept is as absurd as Facebook removing "like" counts from comments, which has an identical function for a time poor person like myself. I'm sure there is a good reason to hide the scores, however, it is a deal breaker for users who share my opinion.

- 1.00 bit = 100 satoshis

Banks now push these "Debit cards" as well as Credit cards that fall prey to the same vulnerabilities. The majority of users are now handing these over to Paypal instead of traditional account details, just because it's easier. This means the majority of Paypals funding sources are held hostage by the CC company's chargeback policy. They know this is a massive hole in their business model.
They need a way to allow sellers of digital products to say, "Your credit cards are no good here" without excluding the majority of the user base. Saying "digital products should be bought with digital money" has a pretty catchy ring to it.

Hey! You gave me my first tip! I guess this is your fault I'm tipping on GitHub now ;-)
@_date: 2014-12-05 23:54:56
In the open source world, the developer's time and product are free and open. It translates to lots of attention and many third parties reporting bugs, making contributions, etc.
How it occurs for the developer:
To maintain the integrity of the product, contributions cannot be accepted blindly and bugs take time to investigate. In most cases there simply isn't enough time in the day to respond to the needs of everyone. The expectations are high but the reward is low.
How it occurs for the consumer:
Open source is great leverage to get things done faster, but the product quality can suffer sometimes. When there is a problem often the fix is simple, however getting attention is difficult -- take a ticket and wait (the linked issue has been waiting 9 months). This is a show stopper that can cost money. Being dependent on open source can be crippling.
To clarify:
Tipping on GitHub provides a mechanism to escalate "show stoppers" for consumers, and for developers, illuminates issues where the difference between people hurting and people complaining is night and day.

Stolen cards are accounted for with the other chargeback categories. If the transaction was not authorized, it will be reversed no matter what. Lying about this is fraud.

Food-like substances are "real food" laced with drugs. This is an over exaggeration to help make the point clear.
Just to clarify, most available food products fall in to this category. The distinction being one occurs naturally, the other is fine tuned in a laboratory. (Both in the majority, not exclusively of course.)
If you want an example, travel to India and eat the McDonalds there. You won't find any burgers, but you should notice the food has a similar flavor. This because the food is branded -- McDonalds has a patented additive (like a perfume) that makes any food taste like McDonalds. Most big food chains have this, nothing special about Mickey D's.
Now ask yourself this, if a company was secretly lacing your food and water with drugs designed to make you eat more of their brand and reject other food types. Is the decision still yours? 
You should see the personal responsibility argument is naive. Like a heroin addict saying they can stop anytime they want. Worse, TELLING a heroin addict they can stop anytime they want. They know this and it's easy for you to say it. But the chemistry in their body overwhelmingly says otherwise.
Enjoy the 99c burgers for sure when times are tough. But when you get your life together again, you'll probably find yourself still eating it due to cravings that are now baked in to your system. The bacteria in your gut has been exposed to *the good shit* and it wants more.

Not at all. China can own the majority blockchain by hashing power, but we can decide not to use it. By that I mean, the blockchain that has all the transactions on it is more powerful than the blockchain with the most hashing power. China will always follow the money (the transactions), that means Bitcoin will always be owned by the masses.

SegWit can be seen as preparation for such an event. If QC becomes a threat, the algorithm will need to be changed, this can occur with or without SegWit as a soft fork.
However, it is my understanding that if this event were to occur without SegWit, that 169x increase will be stored on the main blockchain. If we assume that signatures represent ~50% of a transaction, this would be like requiring a ~85mb block size to match today's capacity. Ouch!
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:35:03
Hey luke! I thought the whole point of SegWit was to move the signatures off the blockchain, only leaving the transaction data.

Don't let this hold you back, think about this for a moment.
All of these under developments are irrelevant, they will come eventually or maybe they won't. Bitcoin has already overcome the most difficult challenge: fair initial distribution. It is highly likely if bitcoin "fails", the new solution will have its value derived from bitcoin to leverage the existing trust and credibility. In other words, if you own value in bitcoin today, that value will be transferred to the next system, whether we call it bitcoin or not.
This factor is what we may eventually refer to as its "intrinsic value" being the first to market, biggest, widely trusted and too big to fail.

Hmmm, that's just the first link that came up for me in Google. I've read quite a few sources and I was of the mind that it would divide the transaction data in to two data stores, one for spend I/Os and one for signatures. Doesn't really matter how big the latter gets because not everyone needs to carry it (a bit like what pruning does today).
Antonopoulos likened it to throwing away a check (signature) once the money enters the account (transaction is confirmed).
I thought, this is the reason for the ~2mb block size increase as a bi-product, since the signatures are no longer included in the blockchain. I also thought this is the reason people are crying fear that to non-SegWit clients "any SW transaction is spendable by anyone" because it has no signature data.
If all I know on this is wrong, can you provide me with a source of valid information?

ELI5 Bitcoin wallets:
Imagine how many grains of sand there are on planet earth.
Now imagine if we had 20,000 planets.
Visit any planet, go to any beach and pick up 1 grain of sand.
This grain is special because you chose it, you will hide your bitcoins under this grain of sand.
No one will ever, ever find it unless you tell them where it is.
Think how long it would take for someone to find it without knowing where to look?
The odds are 1 in a "quindecillion".
There isn't enough minerals available to build a device to remember all the places they've looked.
Even if they somehow made this device, there isn't enough coal and gas to make the electricity to power it.
A quindecillion is so big, there just isn't enough computational power in the known universe.
Now everyone agrees that only some of these incredibly rare grains of sand are as good as gold.
So that's how it works. Using really, really big numbers. Nearly impossible to imagine.
It's also why the bitcoin motto is "Vires in Numeris" which means "Strength in Numbers".

The thing I don't get about this is the stored amount is fluid, anyone can send extra coin to the public address to make it more valuable. This is obviously a crazy hard design challenge, but one I like to think about nonetheless.  Almost like each note should be transformative. For example, if you could overlay .2BTC over .1BTC to make the design match the value as it grows. The amount merely represents the "minimum" amount then stored on the note until it hits the next threshold.
Here is a story, Joe wants to buy some shoes off Sally for 0.123 btc. Joe has a 0.1BTC note that he can use, but it's not enough. Joe adds an extra 0.023 btc to the note. Sally verifies and accepts. As the note circulates, this process repeats and eventually the note becomes worth 0.2BTC.

Just kidding. I think this is a case for the replace by fee feature that was added recently. I found this [python library]( but it looks not to be noob friendly. I wonder if any wallets are supporting this feature yet?
I think technically this might work too:
1. Export your private key
1. Close the original wallet [client] you sent the bitcoin with
1. Wait 72 hours
1. Import private key to a new wallet [client]
1. Send the transaction again with a higher fee
The idea here is that the original wallet might be rebroadcasting the transaction, preventing it from expiring. If you use a different wallet, theoretically it should have no idea you spent the coins. I think this is considered a "double spend" strategy.

I agree there is a lack of leadership and a communication breakdown. I don't think core are being intentionally malicious or anything. We all want the same thing for bitcoin, we just disagree about how to get there. To me I see it as nature taking its course.
I agree too, 2mb is not dangerous, but it does kick the can down the road and puts even more at stake when D-day comes for 2mb, as it has for 1mb. Right now there is intense pressure to fix the inevitable scaling issues, this can be seen as a good thing. I can sympathise with both camps. As a side note, I don't subscribe to either.

Bitcoin is limited by the very thing that Lightning solves. As much as people like to complain, there is still lots of work to be done. When the transaction volume can be stored securely using a fraction of the actual transmission data, it'll solidify the protocol as something truly useful. Like email, forever embedded in our culture.
Just like the internet, gov/banks will catch up eventually and convert legal tender to a system like it. Not sure it will "take off" as such, it'll be more like a slow creep that exponentially grows in to a landslide. A bit like smart phones we'll wake up one day and think how did we ever operate without it.

This is the birth canal used when the software first loads. These addresses are the interchangeable ushers that guide you in to the network.
This code change is more of a gesture to say, "we don't want core ushering us, we want our own ushers, kthnx". They all fundamentally lead to the same place, so it's much of a muchness.
I interpret this as scrubbing every trace of the core team from the project, which I believe is the project's intention and why they aren't simply running the original SegWit.

@_date: 2017-06-20 22:05:54
I would think the solution here is pretty obvious:
1. Open app
2. Select preferred / trusted LN node
3. User is shown a dedicated btc address
4. User sends coin to address and waits (account establishment)
4. Channel is automatically opened with maximum amount
5. Adding more funds closes and reopens a new "max channel" (account top up)
6. Expired channels automatically settle and reopen
7. User can close account by providing another bitcoin address (account closure)
In this approach the traditional bitcoin wallet becomes invisible. There is only ever a LN channel that is maxed out and self managing.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:14:51
Ok so here's what could happen. In about 45 days the network will split in to two chains. One will fail to gain traction and be treated as a new coin, with a value similar to Bitcoin's closest sibling, LTC. The other will remain as Bitcoin and lose 50% of its value in a single stroke.
Above is not opinion but based on a previous split of Bitcoin's closest competitor.

I'm not sure I agree with this. Miners seem to forget their place in all this. Like a fly to manure, they will follow the money (users). The outcome is up to us. The current position to pay exorbitant fees is unacceptable, we have consensus on that. I can't think of any reason a user would want to remain on a nerfed chain. Can you?

Luke-Jr lives and breathes bitcoin, almost to an unhealthy and unbalanced level. How he finds the time, I'll never know. It's good for us, of course, but most people doing what he does would burn out in 2 weeks.

Tech companies give away their tools for free; Twitter's Bootstrap, Google's Angular, Facebook's React. We may very well see Goldman Sachs' blockchain, who knows. If of course it meets the same qualifications of being free, fair and open.

Oh ok, cool, let's change the 21 million cap too while we're at it then.
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:00:36
Ok I'll bite...
- Stability: $1 in bitcoin is more stable than $1 in any other.
- Liquidity: Moving 10 million worth of value causes less of a price swing.
- First mover advantage: Translates to a greater perceived value. Important if you want to be a currency.
- Legacy growth: More support, more integrations, more documentation, more users, more everything.
- Simple: Less moving parts, less to go wrong.
- Mainstream integration: 
- Hardened: Something only gained through an aging process.
- Pioneering: The scaling solution of payment channels is as cool as the invention of bitcoin itself.
- Open: This is the most important. All issues that seem impossible at the time will always be resolved. This is the nature of code that is allowed to be free and the endless persistence of the hive mind.

Gave this some thought and I think the odds are stacked against it. Exchanges will split the tokens first and kick off the aforementioned bloodbath. Users from both camps will be in a flurry to sell one token for the other. The operative word SELL being the first part of this process. This logic is going to sink in eventually, when the confusion subsides.

I call this the eye of the storm. Having been here a couple of times now, it's pretty familiar. It's a bit like floating, its easy to get comfortable here and it feels safe. You actually feel stupid for selling now because of this delusion. When it's all over, in hindsight, you know this metaphor fits exactly and you wonder how the price held for so long.
I analyse it like this: It's reddit, the front page of the internet. You are the 1% of the 1% just by showing up. Everyone else is getting their news from bloody facebook for christ's sake, so it's gonna take a while for this stuff to sink in.
It also feels like a plane stalling, the discussion goes a bit quiet except for a noisy few who make all these "comments in passing", things that are just like statements with no backing behind them, not many long comment threads and so on.

This is a pretty myopic view. Bitcoin is the first element on the digital periodic table. Yes, it takes resources to create it, that's the very thing that makes it scarce and hence valuable. The intrinsic value comes from being unstoppable and controlled by no one. The speculative value comes from the fact that we haven't seen this for a very long time. Hardly a waste. You're not the first to ring this bell, or the first to be contradicted by bitcoin's ever growing success.

I'm sure there is a reasonable story behind these accusations, if I ever get a chance to speak to him personally I'll let you know, otherwise it's just hearsay. Authentic means he's not pretending to be someone he's not. Either way I respect his decisions on the basis that he is authentic by character. Why must all people be perfect, not make mistakes and only wear attire that pleases your eye? That's totally fake and you should get over it and yourself :P Nice comeback too btw

Poor choice of words. Should've said retain control over the original (winner) chain and prevent UASF from carrying the torch, making it the fork (loser) instead. What I mean is the contingency plan could be a diversion. There are some odd features that don't make sense, this is one of them (mining in private).

It is true that I can swap a damaged note for a new one at any bank.
1. Bank teller notices defaced or damaged note.
2. Bank teller places note in a designated pile "Unfit to be reissued".
3. Bank compiles a list of note serial numbers.
4. Bank sends to Mint (or equiv.) as a credit application.
5. Mint verifies serial numbers, destroys damaged notes and credits bank with the amount.

I think stencils would be more effective, at least it has earnt a cultural significance as art. Rather you could be doing the exact opposite -- declining the cause. Let me halluciniate some possibilities with you. 
**What I assume you are hoping:**
*Every person who looks at the note is exposed to Bitcoin and suddenly forms a positive position to Bitcoin. They love it and tell everyone they know.*
**What I think will actually happen:**
*Only a small percentage of people present in the moment actually notice their defaced note. A smaller percentage take action on their overstimulated lives to learn about Bitcoin. They suddenly remember they found it via a dishonourable act and form a negative or cautious (at best) position of Bitcoin.*
*At the Mint there is a spike in defaced notes that uniformly mention "Bitcoin". A worker decides to escalate the issue to the powers that be, who take one look at it and now all credibility for Bitcoin is lost. Everyone involved no longer takes Bitcoin seriously.*
Two things I'm trying to convey:
* First impressions last.
* Trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repair.
Bitcoin relies heavily on trust. I fear that what you are doing is losing trust in the majority of people you show this to as a first exposure.
tl;dr spam via graffiti gives a bad impression
