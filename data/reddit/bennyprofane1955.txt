No one wants to hold a currency that increased in value 14X in 1 year and more than 30X in 2 years...?  That's even after it's large recent correction to which you referred.  Not too shabby (though you do have a fair point about the crazy fees these days)

Wait a minute.  First you said it was obviously hacked.  Then later in your post you said it has been bought by Ver.  
So...which is it...?
If you believe it was actually hacked, what evidence do you have?
IF you believe it was bought by Ver, then if you contact Twitter and claim it was hacked, then you are being dishonest, aren't you...?

except BTC w 1 mb blocks has a huge problem w/ high fees and delays, while BCH has up to 8 mb blocks when needed and low fees and is fast... otherwise theyre really the same
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:02:03
That's what I was wondering too.

Looks like you were quite wrong.  BCH went up, not down, when Coinbase opened trading.

That was OP's point.  Bitcoin Cash is not a *publicly traded stock*, nor are other digital currencies.

And moving BTC from one wallet to another is worse - fees are like $10 per sometimes... u need 2 send like $500 for it to make sense.  This is a problem.  Who wants to spend $10 to send a payment?

See my reply below: tried all options even the lowest priority allowed and still over $10. As far as the mempool, this technology is just not at all impressive if you have to wait days for the mempool to get less congested, watch it like a hawk and then jump in when it is less congested to quickly do a payment with the hope of it costing less than $10 and going through within an hour.  
And I don't think anyone is "spamming" the network with the exorbitant cost of doing so.
Why is the block size limit still stuck at 1 MB?  If they just allowed an increase, users would not be stuck waiting hours or days and paying huge fees.  If BTC is going to succeed, it needs a bit more capacity.

The fees are getting to be a real problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:55:52
Which wallets allow you to set your own fees?  breadwallet does not (I don't think).
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:22:17
Ok, sorry, but that doesnt seem to help.  I downloaded Mycelium, assuming that will be better than using breadwallet which seems to offer no option for setting fee.  On Mycelium I was going to send 0.02 BTC and it did give me choices, but get this:  
Low Priority:   0.00073 ($10.60) * could take days to confirm
Economy:  0.00081 ($11.75) * warned it will take long to confirm
Normal:  0.001 ($14.50)
Sorry, but you don't see these ridiculous network fees as a problem for BTC, regardless of the wallet?  This is ridiculously expensive, especially if it could take hours or possibly even days to confirm a transaction.  How long will it be before new adopters realize this is a charade and there is nothing good or useful about this type of money transmission?  I can do a domestic bank wire transfer for less than it costs to send BTC right now, and bank ACH is free or virtually free.

Not necessarily, most of the other alts are not constrained by a 1 mb block size, right?
