I know you might need the money but keep it and sell it for a profit.

You're good I sent from gdax to ledger segwit and it took 26 hrs. Don't be scared lol

ah i wish, I put in $150 when BTC was about $2,500. I was unemployed at the time so couldn't put much in. I wish I had some real money to put in at the time

That happen to me when sending from coinbase to ledger. Didn't show up on blockchain for 26 hrs but coinbase said sending
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:50:21
Transaction took close to 26hrs in case anyone cares.

Maybe i dont know what im talking about because thats possible but i read something about Segwit2X for dec 28
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:48:58
Yeah that really sucks especially with the fork coming. Hopefully it clears by today...
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:27:30
moral of the story: dont use coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:57:37
That happen to me but I don't think it was on gdax and can't remember which wallet I was transferring from. I had to manually put in the amount.

 I've never been in the situation but all you need is your seed. So don't share it with anyone and keep it safe just in case

Thanks for the kind words. I learned something today, don't transfer funds before bed because then you can't sleep. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:01:37
Thanks will try there too 
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:25:06
not with Mercatox or Mycellium bit my longest transaction lasted over 26 hrs. have faith! lol and if not that sucks. did you check the blockchain?

So if my AGI is less than 37,951 I could end up paying 0% if I hold for a year or longer? But either way I should claim it correct?

Thanks I see my confusion now..
