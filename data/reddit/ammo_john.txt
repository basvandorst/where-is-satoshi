In poker they say you need +20.000 played hands to have an idea of you are a winning player, and +100.000 hands to be sure. Anything before that could always be dumb luck (mixed with perhaps breakeven skills). But if you belong to the \~10% making more money by trading than by hodling BTC you are a very clever person, and would for sure recognise the soundness of my advice, and recommend that others don't trade. Also, trading means keeping your money on an exchange instead of a wallet. Remember, not your keys, not your bitcoin.

Apart from questionable past, I would say BitcoinHex: 
I also remember the timing of how BitcoinHex came about, Richards podcast at that time, his sentiments... i.e. the how and why of BitcoinHex. If you want to follow along, watch Richards show before the idea (and his real thought on ERC20 tokens, and altcoins and such) and then watch him do a 180 after he broke down and realised we were at a beginning of the new BTC bear market, his desperation and what this all would do to his finances, and THEN his following idea that basically amounts to a Ponzi scheme.

Congratulations! If you feel like you are late to the party I could give you a shortcut: don't dabble in alt coins and trading, just hodl. With that advice you will be ahead of some of the people that started a couple of years before you. Best of luck!

It shouldn't be their first rodeo. The mining companies know about the halving far in a advance and should have allocated their resources appropriately. Making sure to store the wins before a halving to make up for their losses afterwards.

Buy, study, don't sell. In that order.
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:14:42
And I can't recommend him enough NOT to trade. Just save the amount you can afford each month in crypto and hodl for the future. The vast majority lose a lot of their gains by trading. Don't waste time studying trading, study what actually matters, what bitcoin is and how it works and the development projected into the future, this is a better investment of your time. Oh, and stay away from alt coins. GL!

There's no official bitcoin app. The whole idea with bitcoin is that you don't have a centralised and official anything. Any app that says it's official is a scam.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:07:58
Are you trading or investing? If investing at 6800€ it's way to early to sell. Just hodl and trust your investment.
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:13:56
The worst thing a gambler can experience is early success. GL, maybe you are the 1% that makes money in alts + trading over long term.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:07:51
Naver hold someone else's investment. When friends ask I always say the same:  
1. Safest option is to dollar-cost-average in and start today.
2. Make sure you study bitcoin (read The Bitcoin Standard) otherwise you will always sell at the wrong time. If you buy because of FOMO, and don't learn the how, why and state of bitcoin you will sell at FUD.)
3. Be ready to HODL long term and don't come knocking on my door if price takes a dive.
4. Never invest more than you are ready to lose.
5. Store your BTC off an exchange, preferably on a hardware wallet.
6. Be safe. Stay away from alt coins and trading.
7. Don't lose your keys.
Having said that. If you're afraid of an imminent dump and don't mind to gamble I would recommend putting in buy orders and stack them from current price down to $5000, making sure you catch whatever falling knife occurs. Ofc the gamble is that you might not get as much BTC as you wished for if the price doesn't drop enough.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:34:09
Hope you find a local solution. Be wary of getting scammed though, easily the case if get too eager. Check out if [ can work for you. Remember the bitcoin has to transfer to your address for which only you should have the privatekey (or if you can buy through a trusted exchange).

I commend you for working, saving and acquiring bitcoin. A lot of people try to take a shortcut by trading the small amounts they have and almost always lose more in the process (long term) than just working and hodling. A good deal of people who have more than 1BTC will lose their money or part of that sum before any mass adoption.
Work, buy BTC, hodl, and don't dabble in alt coins and trading is the best advice out there. And so you're killing it!
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:00:04
The answer should be: "not enough" and then you can go on about how you are trying to acquire more. Maybe they get the hint and save you from lecturing them in etiquette.

The traders/speculators create the fluctuation. The hodlers stabilise the price. Although the general idea of hodling is to hold your bitcoin until it becomes the new de facto world currency, some will sell it for dollars way before that. They will all sell at whatever price is right for them in their life and under their circumstances. They will sell hesitantly because being a hodler means you know that the network can keep growing almost indefinitely. People using something as a store of value are not the people creating high volatility.

BTC.com is owned by BCH people trying to capitalise on BTC, stay away at all cost.
@_date: 2019-11-09 00:43:58
Ok cool, thanks! (everything else still applies though)
@_date: 2019-11-22 10:17:30
Saving small sums in increments is just fine. Just make sure this is not eaten up by fees though (don't know cashapp and their fee structure).
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:15:37


@_date: 2019-11-21 01:11:14
Yeah, you got scammed and you will never see that money again. The story is equivalent of falling for a nigerian email scam, so if you don't keep more wits about you you will be susceptible for scams every day of your life. Can only assume you are young and you need to should chalk this up as an expensive learning experience.

Won't the lightning network make transactions more private?
@_date: 2019-11-09 15:49:57
Well to be fair, if you are measuring dominance you should be comparing it to all the other coins. The more, the more accurate. I do however believe that alts will never gain as much as they've had, vs bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:20:12
great question
@_date: 2019-11-24 12:28:20
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:30:01
Okay, then scratch me wishing you good luck. It's obvious you don't need it.
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:11:28
You need to answer that yourself. But if you do decide to buy, than yes, now is good time to buy (consolidation phase). Also, if you buy, make sure to commit doing research, if you don't understand bitcoin and why it's good, you will sell at the wrong time, or get scammed, make a mistake, lose it, or so on. Also if this is your whole retirement account, I would not invest it all, only invest a portion, for your own sanity.

That's an old macbook. Early investor?

USA is just one country, not even sure you have the most bitcoin, I don't think it would affect the price notably.

End of bear market &amp; alts on the continued decline.
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:35:31
Welcome back! So many people will continue to lose money by gambling with alts and trading. You paid dearly for your lesson and I hope you learned your lesson. Don't get carried away trading BTC either. Just study bitcoins tech/history/development (knowledge of this is your best bet against FOMO or FUD), keep your coins safe (off from exchanges) and HODL for the long term (don't get greedy). GL!
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:21:55
Except it's not. It's you vs nobody.
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:28:35
No, that's probably how to satisfy the regulators.

Way to miss the point. I'm saying the freedom dividend only affects US population.

Nice! He should be ducking from alt coins.
