Not and expert's  opinion:
Others try to be/look open (like bitstamp where you have to submit your ids when register and provide docs if you move more that $$$)
btc-e isn't open (doesn't look open). You don't (or didn't) have to provide ids when register. I used the service for buying BTC. No complaints. I don't speculate, I don't keep the funds there.

as per 
I've left 3 1$ tips for youtube videos (and fail with one more). 12 hours later only one is processed.
youtube tipping is still in beta.
Leaving tips is not without glitches.
For example, it is not easy to pull +username in the comment. If there are spaces in the name you cannot just copy and paste it. Once I failed to find the video author in the drop down list. Another time the message with the tip disappeared. Yet another time the tip has been processed but the reply about it was not there.  
Edit: So I've probably annoyed them instead of pleasantly suprised.

If there is a specific hashtag for tips,
we can consolidate the efforts to break any resistance (or help adoption) or just add tips to someone who could do with some extra. Also, the tag would help to identify the tips coming from this particular 'tipping wave' and later help draw some stats when it runs ashore.

When I import (scan) BIP38 encrypted private key it takes ages (on my cheap phone) and crashes occasionally. Even when the import goes through, it says there was an error importing.
Also, if you have 'watch only' key in the address book and try to import (scan) private key for the same public key and give it the same label, it is shown only as 'watch only'. And you cannot get rid of it. If you archive it, one copy goes to the archive, the other copy stays in the address book and would not move.
@_date: 2014-08-19 05:52:07
A few reason could be:
Moving FIAT money (USD, EUR etc) isn't easy or cheap or fast.
Some exchanges, in some cases, would process your withdrawal only after some clearing time (could be up to 72hours).
Some would hold your funds (if exceed some number) until you give details of their origins.

Before the recent price rise (starting about 2014-05-20)
bitstamp used to have highest rates, closely followed by huobi, followed by  btc-e (with 1-2% difference sometimes).
Now huobi with other Chinese exchanges have highest rates (over 2% in some cases).

They could have fixed that "wrong amount for withdrawal" by now. Its been there for ages (such a simple thing to fix).
As you open a new account, they will put a hold on the withdrawals, that's normal.  As you change some settings to your account (email, password) they would put a hold.
Also, they can put a hold for some types of deposit (if I remember correctly up to one month for wire transferes). For some payment systems (OKpay, PerfectMoney etc) it could from 3 days to a a week.
This is for security reasons.
They could 'facelift' the website, it doesn't impress with its interface at all.

Telegram is familiar. And the mentioned bot service uses same model as Localbitcoins: easy transition.
Privacy isn't the major concern.
The main hurdle in bitsquare adoption is the 'effort' overhead, be it mental, time, energy, learning etc.
I believe Bitsquare itself is not the only(final) step. There's also payment services which I need to integrate with. They also incur additional effort (their conditions/limits etc may spoil the game and all the efforts).
As I only use that type of services for an occasional trade, I'm not motivated enough to try it.
Installing software seems like a hustle too. As I'm in development environment.
 
I've known about bitsquare and should give it a try eventually.

My understanding:
As a miner find a block, they pack it with transactions from the mempool and collect the transaction fees.
Selfish mining empty empty blocks is to publish the found block without including any transactions.
Empty blocks usually come when the same (selfish) miner finds two ore more blocks in a row. As the previous block would not even have time to propagate over the network, a selfish miner has already started mining the next block.
I do know all the blockchain mechanics, but the time advantage is possible if you do not include/verify transactions in the block.
Also, the  technology of BitMain of AntPool and Jihan Wu is alleged to have empty blocks as the evidence of its use. This is the actual reason for my post.

Coinmarket says 'withdrawals impeded' for these two Korean exchanges 
But, they had 24h ETH vol of 206k and 143k.
In contrast, poloniex (accounted for 26% of total ETH across 'all' the exchanges) had only 163k.
Also, the internal vol of ETH traded would reach 60%, while BTC vol would stay under 20%.
Clearly, the recently entered [groups of] people have different perspective on the cryptocurrency landscape. And not in favor of BTC.

15 % of it got the Korean coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinone/

1) **SegWit** - 1.7MB
2) **SegWit + Schnorr** Signatures - 3-4MB
**Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables (IBLT) and Weak Blocks**
 With IBLT and Weak Blocks, the latency bottleneck on Bitcoin’s ability to scale is replaced with a bandwidth bottleneck. By solving the latency issues related to the propagation of newly-mined blocks around the network, it may become safer to increase Bitcoin’s block size limit further in the future.
