Always buy more in the dips. If you're not looking to HODL, you can actually make and alright amount just buying and selling the lows and highs (BTC tends to fluctuate a few % over the week)
Personally I'm holding, but I have friends into crypto who manage to make a couple hundred £ a month day/week trading. Might no get much advice on it hear though since day trading seems to be pretty looked down on. 
Also very important that you find an exchange with a low fee because otherwise the fees will destroy your profits on smaller amounts

Bitcoin is never, *ever* going to replace normal currency. It is in no way suited to that role and I don't understand people's obsession with the idea
