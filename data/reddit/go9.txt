Altcoins are more volatile and there is more profit to be made if you do the right choices. If I had little money, I would try to trade with altcoins. Otherwise just save up some money and invest.
Btw I'm currently working on a bitcoin website and need some content. If you want I can pay you 15$ in bitcoin/per article for some nice meaty articles. It's a good way to learn about the subject and get payed at the same time..Just PM if you're interested.

No, he's just a /b/tard or whatever they are called..
The drawing is pretty good tho, gets my upvote ;)

I think you will see a lot more drops like that in future..But in the longterm the price will still be going up.

I actually started trading bitcoin just to learn the basics of trading before moving up to the real stock market. Trading is can also be fun..I see it as a gamble with bitcoin tho. Either you lose big or you win big.

Probably not...People are a bit afraid after the recent crash..Maybe in January?

Or was it a fake?

itbit also looks like a pretty good exchange. Waiting for my account to be verified there so I can try it out. I started to compile my own [list]( of bitcoin exchanges as well but the site is still in early development.

Won't happen..

Not much you can do with 10$...the exchange fees will pretty much wipe away any of your profit. I would say find a way to make more money (or bitcoin) before starting to trade.

Pretty big site..1M monthly visitors according to [compete](

YES. I'm still waiting for my account to be approved with cavirtex to get some more money in. I was soo inching to buy some PPC at 3$ but no way to get some funds in..

As much as I like bitcoin..I think I would still vote for Edward Snowden.
