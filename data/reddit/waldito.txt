I think the whole point is that Greece is likely being banned from Europe, and thus, forced to change it's currency into a local currency (Drachmas again, I guess)
Imagine waking up one day and all the Euros in your account are suddenly converted into drachmas, at a conversion rate pretty unfair for you: you just lost acquisitive power within your country. But what's worse, the &lt;other&gt; countries euro based are now far from your reach economically, so anything towards outside, like holidays or imports, are no longer convenient. Your Drachmas will probably go downhill from there, loosing even more value. 
So people are trying to convert their individual stacks of money stored in banks in hard cash (euros), before the probably imminent currency change happens. If you manage to convert everything that is on the bank to Euro-Cash in your pocket, you are likely to maintain the value of your money.

Ning is an old website where you can create your 'community' as in for free. When you create a 'community', all sort of community tools become available, like a photo gallery, forum, wall-a-là-facebook, etc. 
AFAIK, does not belong to the bitcoin foundation, is just an online software used to gather and organize, pretty much like a contained social network...
I wonder how mr. Nicolas Mendoza will obtain logs of that particular user/ip...

i'm from spain. I immediately got it. love the artwork. simple idea, yet entertaining. I say good work, I love your idea of doing this! yay! 
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:53:02
I disagree. 
This should be perhaps upvoted for effort and corrected, pointing out things that requires change. 
I think instead of downvoting it into oblivion, We might end up with a useful BTCELI5 site. I am no BTC expert, but if you say it's wrong, you must have at least a better idea.

Yes, how it was explained to TED was paced, calm and the order of concepts that you usually hear on these talks was different. I think she made a great explanation: the pieces of magic paper, how miners are paid, a warning about how bitcoin can also have side consecuences... overall, neato.

I saw [this video]( about good character crafting in Jurassic Park and got the same feeling!

Now that's how you should attach the cat to the generator. I hoped to see this video here, first comments. *Good.*

This statement, if true, means that taxes are not serving their original purpose. Scary.

Every 'trustful' exchange is likely to be required by authorities to identify you, usually to avoid money laundering/tax evassion. 
Perhaps meeting with a stranger in a cafeteria does the job?

Same. Got mine a few days. Took 72h to 'clear''but I think is a restriction you could lift undergoing a proccess of verification. Didnt bother. Got my coins. All good

Is this a college campus? just a highschool? Lord, the missinformation of the mass media is kind of working. I should buy more. and a boat.

If you expected that question 'Bitcoin Really Worth $1,000?' or the answer in this video: Nop. Just the average pool of questions bitcoin gets every time.
