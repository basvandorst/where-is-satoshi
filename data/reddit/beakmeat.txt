This is also why rolling a 9 in craps is called out as, "center field nine" and "neener niner" while the 5 is called as "fever dice" , "fever fiver", and "no field five" ("field" is a kind of bet that pays on a 9 but not on a 5).

Great platitude. Provide proof. Free markets? LOL - corporate welfare under Republicans is absurd. Small government? Really? How has Trump made the government smaller? GWB? Property of others - tell that to the southern wall builders who are trying to take land.


You do know that Republicans collect taxes as well, right? Also, an investment in healthcare and education is a non-zero sum net positive for the country as it allows us to compete in the world market. 
You talk a good game, but you are on fucking Mars if you think any of this shit is actually happening. Lots of great platitudes that don't actually line up with any real behavior - whether it's your Libertarian pipe dream, these wonderful Conservatives who love telling women when and how they can have sex and want laws to reflect their bullshit supply-side Jesus sycophantism, or these imaginary liberals who just want to steal "everyone elses money" so they can give it to undeserving lazy people.

I am of the mind (currently, ask again later for sure) that the next step function in price, if it is ever achieved, will be from adoption. Adoption, I believe, will follow utility and I mean real, dead fucking simple, grandma in the bottleshoppe type of utility. 
Not "hurr durr you shouldn't have gotten scammed on that android cryptowallet because it was called ABCDEFGHIJKMLNOP wallet not, the obvious ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP wallet, get rekt n00bsauce and next time do your proper research" world we live in today.

But I am hopeful - I've been in tech a long time, and watched technologies mature (Search is an easy example, or even access to the web itself... shit - I recall when, gasp, preconfigured computers began to come standard with... wait for it... MODEMS [BBS's got so rekt with n00bs it was pathetic... for a while]).

@_date: 2018-09-26 15:18:33
It seems like your argument is a little sideways.
You say that an ICO does not disrupt/compete due to the crypto culture's hoarding. I think you are missing the point.
While an ICO can act like its own currency, it can also act like a share in a company that represents a covenant or part ownership, and be used like a stock offering, to bootstrap that company with needed capital. 100% agree that there have been countless smash-and-grabs in the space as bad actors and greedy dummies met in a new platform (ICO's) but step back a minute.
Right now, to get funding for your company/restaurant/whatever you have a few choices - you can Shark Tank it (there are VC's all over the place who are willing to make measured bets on unproven but apparently good ideas), you can get family/friends/max your cc's to fund you, or you can beg a bank for a loan. All 3 of these options have their benefits and downsides. At least 2 of these options have established gatekeepers that are risk averse such that they may not be willing to fund a cutting edge idea. When you democratize funding opportunities, we see an ecosystem pop up. We saw this with KickStarter and their copycats. Even GoFundMe in some ways is in the same bucket, though the expectation of returns is generally not expected (but even KickStarter lets you fund good ideas just for the lulz if you want).
Your initial argument focused too much on the "thing" (ICO) and not on what the thing allows to happen through its existence. That is the disruptive part.
Will they work? Are they legal? How do people get value from an ICO other than selling it at a higher price later? These questions are for the market to figure out.

It's more the "leave a review to help others" method. You could always go to a shitty restaurant, have a truly shit meal, and think "fuck, I hope everyone else figures out how shit it is by eating here first" or you can leave a review that says why it is shit and others can say "hmm... X people thought it was shit, I won't go there" method.
Except here it's a discoverability issue. Don't give equal weight to unequal things.

Not sure who "you guys" are. Critical thinkers? People interested in technology? Usernames that start with the letter "B"?


Sorry, but this is a bullshit statement. You might enjoy the works of Karl Popper.


You are correct, but you ignored my very reason for pointing this out. It is also difficult to get funding for a business that **does** have a good prospect. 


Definitely not. When banks bundled mortgage securities that were rated as "dogshit grade" and sprinkled a few AAA mortgages in on top and called the package "100% shiny AAA mortgage pack" as they sold it to others. Then when it all went to hell it was about scapegoating the "people who shouldn't have mortgages in the first place". 


That's great. Paul Krugman thought the internet was a piece of shit. Wheeeee. The fact that you are mixing your initial calling out of ICO's with generic cryptos talk suggests to me that you don't know the difference, which may be why you seem confused in your original statement and in your responses. You also conveniently ignored my argument that ICOs create a new way to fund ideas (like Kickstarter and other crowdfunding created a new innovation and investment market) - I'm not sure if you disagree or don't understand.

I tend to give these oldsters a pass when it comes to crypto, for the simple reason that it takes some serious research to understand what they are all about and their potential. 
In Q4 of last year, when DerpCoin_562 was tripling in value every 8 minutes, any reporter with a pulse was shoving a microphone in the face of anyone who has ever said the word "investment" and asking them about bitcoin. 99.999% of them (Bufett and Munger included) knew very little, if anything about them. What they did know, if they knew anything, was the surface economic aspects and the exuberance of poorly informed n00bs. To them, reasonably, that looked like a tulipfest. 
So when 1990's grandpa says the internet looks like a waste of time to him... you just let him think that and move on doing your own thing.

I recall the smug and measured statement he made when he went on TV awhile back and the BCash price had "just happened" to be going up quite a bit since around 4 hours prior to the interview. He said (IIRC) "I *personally* have not sold any bitcoin or bitcoin cash today, but I'm happy to see the price rising."
Let's pretend that is true. It's telling what he doesn't say in that statement, e.g. that someone else, maybe someone he knows and works with, an individual or a group even, is pumping the shit out of BCH in coordination with his introducing it to the curious folks in TV world. The obvious follow-up question was not asked, of course, because it was a friendly interview, but to me I immediately thought it a suspicious way to frame a statement. He had that "twinkle in his eye, as if the technicality of not personally pumping BCH at that moment was a Fischerian chess move.

True. I'd pop over there every once in a while so I watched from afar how the sub was forming a few years back. There was a shitton of Craig worship even as the Faketoshi label was in full aplication. "Well I don't **knooooooooow** if he is or isn't, do **yoooooooooou?** was the common refrain. It was mind-boggling in its personality cult worship. The ole Fakerino became, for a short time during the SV fun the Antichrist. 
In the end, I liken it to high-school dogshit. You have the kids who listened to punk rock, the kids who dressed punk but only kinda listened to it, and peripheral punks who donned the costume and constantly bitched about punk street cred, who was a poseur, etc. Suddenly Garth Brooks got popular and half of those costume goofballs traded in their Doc Martens for cowboy boots... and the gossip continued.

* Important news on BTC broke that day (yes/no)
* Whether Bitcoin is banned in China that day (yes/no)

Water is your enemy. Do not allow anything water related (roof, pipes, leaky windows) to continue at all, ever.
The rest is discretionary. 
I'd also suggest you don't change anything inside the house until you've lived in the house for a good 6 months. By then you'll know what you must change vs like to vs don't actually care. It will help you be more efficient (e.g. you remodel something and then 4 months later crash half of it opening up a space because you didn't think it all through).

I have a slightly different take. It was a failed coup.
The folks who started or took over (I don't know the lineage of the sub exactly) thought that once BCH came out it would become THE TRUE BITCOIN. There was talk of a "flippening" when BCH would surpass the value and usage of BTC. Owning that subreddit was a part of the big plan. Much like the more recent BCHSV attempted coup, it failed, though a new billion dollar currency was created that is plugging along.

So it looks like it might be a "bounded blockchain" - whereby those who use it (institutions) have insight/transparency but it remains an immutable and therefore accurate ledger? 
I don't see a nefarious takeover attempt (in the court of public opinion), but rather an adoption of the parts of crypto they like and can operate with. 
I don't believe in crypto-purity (don't like it, don't use it...) and the author of this article seems to be a bit hung-up on that.

Having followed crypto for several years here's the way I see it: there have been three different categories of alternate cryptocurrencies. The first is scam coins. These like the ico's of last year were created specifically to trick people into investing with the expectation that someone would take the money and run. We see this with flashy marketing, huge pre mine and other shady shit. 
The second set is similar but more technical (low marketing) and less shady. These coins were simply forks of Bitcoin or Litecoin and were people either playing around like we saw with Doge or put together by tech savvy individuals who lacked vision - maybe they were creating their own crypto sandbox. These coins like Catcoin Ron Paul Coin Etc became more social experiments (maybe even accidental social experiments) but provided nothing really to the technology except maybe helping exchanges on-ramp new coins as quickly as possible. The third are the coins that I think will actually survive - put together by tech savvy individuals who are trying new ideas or features that go beyond simple forking.

No. But here's how it works: 
* User X brags somewhere that they have X bitcoin, and it seems plausible.
* Later on, this user does something that doxxes them and/or exposes their account (reused handles get hacked somewhere else online, for example)
* Person with compromised info on a bunch of peeps scans Reddit, matches the "right people" to phish/hack/social engineer
So it's more that you are giving one piece of evidence that might make you a target later. If BTC goes up to $50k per coin, for example, that might be meaningful, especially if OP lives in certain countries.

The BTC expert's major fail was to talk about CPU power vs blockchain. 
Q: "Why can't a fake bitcoin be introduced?"
A: "Because of bitcoin's distributed ledger (aka blockchain) in which everyone using it has a copy of who owns what. You try to add in a coin to your version of the ledger and it doesn't line up with any other legder record. It's like taking your copy of your bank account statement and writing a few extra zeros on that paper copy and trying to tell the bank you are a millionaire."
While this answer isn't 100% accurate, it's damn close enough.

Biggest problems I have heard of over the several years of arbitrage attempts:
1. Everything works fine on your first couple small trades, then you try to go big and one of the exchanges holds up your payout/transfer, destroying the opportunity
2. Volume on one exchange is already or goes to shit, so filling your order is impossible.
3. Exit scam on exchange kills all profit
4. Bots flood exchange and destroy margin
Good luck!

Occum's razor:
* Twitter falsified timestamps on Hal Finney's tweet (and any other Bitcoin tweet occurring prior to July 2009), and the members of the crypto mailing list spent untold hours faking timestamps on thousands of messages for 9+ months in order to hide the fact that you told Satoshi how to make Bitcoin in July of 2009 and they want to help Satoshi hide that fact (because: reasons)
* That did not happen and you are delusional.
As for your other comments:


* No it does not. The fact Satoshi has not come forth does not therefore make you the true creator of Bitcoin. It proves nothing.


* Incorrect. His refusal to show up proves nothing. Perhaps he is dead. Perhaps he is in jail. Perhaps he does not give a shit. All possible. No proof of anything.


* Again, this makes no sense. Some rando on the internet says "you are a fraud, I an the real creator of Bitcoin" and Satoshi thinks 'lolwut' and goes about his day cleaning his bathroom. This does not make the accuser (you) automatically the creator of Bitcoin. 
You have a real issue with logic. I seriously believe you are a schizophrenic and probably believe what you are typing. I only answer your comments so that others can see that you aren't making any sense. Please take your meds. Seriously.

Two questions-

2. If yes, when did you go off your meds?
Be honest. If you are off your meds I'm telling you - it's fucking obvious and you are about to have a psychotic break. 
Lastly, and I know arguing with a schizophrenic is mostly pointless but maybe this will help you get back on your meds - your statement about inventing Bitcoin in July of 2009 can not be true. The discussion of Bitcoin was being held on the metzdowd cryptography mailing list as far back as 2008 and there are plenty of timestamped back-and-forth conversations about it prior to when you claim you invented it.

There are several folks who have attempted to track lost bitcoin by varying means. There was a self-reporting thread on bitcointalk (IIRC) about it where you could tell everyone how you nuked your HD back when mining because BTC were sub penny value and you only had 500 so who cares etc... The hard part, of course, is knowing when BTC are truly lost vs in cold storage. 
I know I am guilty, a few years ago when it was worth sub $500, of giving some small amounts to friends who I know do not have access any longer, of leaving some small amounts on exchanges I cannot recall, and of having a software wallet die with some, at the time, small amount. I personally have probably lost, forever, .15 - .25 of a bitcoin, just through playing around (as described above).

Libra was a strawman. They threw out an idea they knew would get shot down in order to get governments and the money people to define what they **can do** (or can't stop). Note that they have not developed the technology, the whitepaper is extremely vague on a number of key points, etc. It's a ruse. What comes next is what you need to pay attention to. Just think about how many man hours governments have put into the reaction to the Libra "announcement".

The sad part is that if it's about the technology then... well... the best tech will win and you could call it "My Butthole Hurts Coin". As the second layer solutions come online (like apps that use crypto natively and mostly invisibly) the name is akin to the importance of the name "TCP/IP" - very few care, very few know. 
But we know that it is NOT about the technology as much as it is about trying to hijack the momentum and the name recognition to bootstrap/jumpstart the BCH technology path. This was painfully obvious with the whole crybaby shit about "BCash" vs. "Bitcoin Cash" -&gt; the obsession with proper branding instead of saying "call it Dog Food Coin, it fucking rules, see you in the marketplace BTC losers". Now suddenly the argument is that it is actually called "Bitcoin", conveniently, after arguing for 3 months it was "Bitcoin Cash" (weeeeeiiiirrrrrrddd... or is it?)
The traditional financial marketplaces - the futures markets, banks, etc. don't seem to give a shit about Dog Food Coin at this point, there is one (two if you count ETH) crypto they trade. Period. Newly minted cryptoneckbeards can bitch all they want but it really doesn't matter. 
The part of this saga that I find annoying is the intent to purposely confuse, justified with the pretzel logic that BTC was Bitcoin until BCH was created and then, magically, the name transferred because "BCH is Satoshi's actual vision" - ignoring that when BCH was created, every system in place for BTC continued to work as it did the prior day. Adding a lot of weird noise into the marketplace (imagine if you were new to crypto and tried to wrap your head around what's going on... I can see a lot of people saying "this is too strange and looks like middle school, not a revolutionary financial technology, my money is not going to be a part of this until it gets straightened out"). So we could be promoting crypto in general, with the expectation that the best tech will win in the places it performs best, but instead there is this marketing noise.

Nice read. But I wonder - why does Lopp say:


Technically, SN has potentially a lot of power over bitcoin.
1. He/They could dump a bunch of coins, tanking the market
2. Concrete proof of Satoshi alive could stir up a media frenzy similar or larger than the last one with Dorian, thereby pushing price higher.
3. SN could send all original coins to a burn address, thereby destroying them.
I suppose maybe Lopp meant SN has no real influence on *the tech* parts of bitcoin? I'd argue SN definitely has influence over the price and psychological aspects of the project.
@_date: 2019-05-06 16:52:22
I did think it was dumb for the Drop Gold commercial to say that gold had no utility. That was silly.
However, let's look at Schiff's argument for why gold is goodness:
* is less volatile
* has a more liquid market
* trades in an established regulatory framework
* has a well-understood role in an investment portfolio
* has little overlap with cryptocurrencies on many sources of demand and supply
* is a safe-haven investment.
1. Less volatile - true for now. Low(er) liquidity = bigger jumps
2. More liquid - yes, true for now. Onramps and offramps are harder for BTC for now.
3. Trades in established regulatory framework - not exactly. Sure you can buy it via ETF, etc. but BTC has some of the same (GBTC, Coinbase buy/sell, etc.)
4. Well understood role - it's older, so more people get it. Not exactly a ringing endorsement.
5. Has little overlap with cryptos - so "gold is better than crypto because it doesn't overlap with them"? Wat?
6. Safe haven - I'll just leave this here: 
    [Over the last four months, gold futures have been knocked to the tune of fifteen percent, sparking reasonable speculation that gold is no longer a significant store of value or even a safe haven asset.](
There's also this statement:
    There is also the issue of supply. While the supply of a given cryptocurrency is constrained, nothing can prevent a new cryptocurrency from being launched, devaluing those already in existence
So, because a new crypto can be created, all crypto is worthless due to eventual dilution... this is only true if all cryptos are valued in some way AND so many cryptos exist that the "demand" market dries up (because everyone has enough shitcoin X Y and Z for a lifetime). The disingenuous statement made here is meant to confuse our derpy uncle who will tell us at the family reunion that "Bitcoin is bullshit, all you have to do is have some high school kid change a line of code and give himself all the bitcoin and BOOM, everyone loses". The fact that so many other coins have been created, have died, faltered, limped along, or thrived post BTC is a testament to its strength, not a sign of weakness. 
In short - the argument is "gold has a better established lifecycle for trading. The rails are well placed."  There is very little in the article that suggests BTC can't catch up to and surpass the position gold holds today. It's akin to saying "your middle school school kid just hit his 50th home run but he's no Babe Ruth, he should give up."
The fact that they felt the need to respond at all is telling.

@_date: 2019-05-06 00:34:57
It's a slightly complicated answer, especially when you are first starting out.
1. Lots of wallets will "auto-set" a fee at X satoshis per byte.
2. If bitcoin gets expensive AND the fee does not change properly, (or you fail to adjust it) then yes, the fee might be a lot of money
But let's talk about fees and why they exist. Only so many tx's (bytes of info, really, but just work with me here) can fit into each 10 minute block. If a tx is not written, the shared ledger does not know it happened, it's kind of in a "pending" state. In order to convince the miner who "discovers" the magic code for the next block (and therefore gets to decide what transactions get written into it) you pay a transaction fee. Some people want, no matter what, to be in that next block, and so they should set a "high" fee. Others don't give a shit... the tx can get written sometime in the next week, so might put a small fee (or even no fee). The "rational miner" then takes all the highest fee tx's possible, writes the block, gets the fees and the queue continues. 
On a side note: a miner can write whatever tx's they want. They could write no tx's (and get 0 fees) if *they want to* (See: Bitmain a few years back). You set your fee to make your tx look enticing compared to the others, and based on how fast you need it to confirm. There are websites that show you what kind of fees = how much time (dynamically). 
You really get fucked on fees when software autofills the fee "blindly" - a lot of older systems did this, and we saw people paying stupid amounts of money to send small amounts of btc to someone else.

I mostly agree with you. I think Buffett's major error in this narrative is that he strays from his core principles when asked about things like bitcoin. Instead of saying "I invest in things of type X, and bitcoin is not type X because A, B, C..." he instead responds as if he were a learned scholar on the topic of cryptocurrencies (see some of his earlier interviews where he mentions bitcoin - he's way off base, but he says things with authority and the interviewer doesn't know better so they move on). 
It's as if he has taken on the role of "wise grandpa who knows shit" and therefore feels like he *has to say something* instead of just saying "I invest in what I understand, and I do not yet understand this"
*Edit: I don't believe he's staying up at night thinking "OMG BTC, how can I kill it... I must start a propaganda campaign and call out the Blackwater Army of Doom".

Coinbase volume is 15x higher on BCH than usual... considering the whole buy side book is &lt;3000 coins and close to 30k have traded in the last 24 hours... looks like a game of hot FOMO potato with a couple extra pumps of sour cream. Grab yr ankles.

And then nothing. I was just pointing out the absurdity of imagining 250k purchased per day.

Is there an additional metric you can calculate that quantifies the size of the potential market? For example a "total value" that represents if all items available were bought at advertised value in crypto? In some sense, number of items is good enough, but once you get to the next level, knowing that market size value becomes meaningful.

Plant a tree. Drink a beer. In that order.

I'm sure some folks cashed out some of their coins back on the run up. Of course, they aren't on here bragging about it...

Seems like a lot of mental energy for a $22 purchase,  but you do you.

Oh shit... sorry mom!
