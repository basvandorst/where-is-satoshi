What is the word on them trading EUR? There's almost no one mentioning them, why? I'm currently transferring cash to them to buy some coins, starting to regret it tho. 
Any thoughts?

Yeah, and now you can't do a SEPA withdrawal from them without a crazy fee on 10 fucking euros. That's just so cheap of them, a SEPA transfer costs them almost nothing, greedy bastards. Glad they are slowly dying.

What now then, bought alot of coins yesterday.. Will we bounce back eventually?

That's interesting, do you have any more info on this decision. Was the market not small enough as it is?  I can't access my account right now.

I really do believe in it, but at the same time i'm not an expert in  any way. So i don't know if it will go down forever or if it will slowly recover to a higher value. Even if it takes a year or seven.

Yeah i can too, i even have a SEPA transfer that should have been in today but nothing...
Somehow i've been blind to all this information about Intersango the last months, didn't know anything. Now i read a bunch of crappy shit that's really making me regret this transfer. I'm buying my coins as fast as i can and then i'm out of there. If the transfer ever goes thru... Bitstamp here i come!
