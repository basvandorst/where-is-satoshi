Will never happen as long as proof of work is the consensus mechanism behind bitcoin. Companies like this defraud consumers for their own centralised data centres.
If bitcoin switched to pos, the huge argument over block sizes would dissappear and many of these criminal organisations would cease to exist.

Exactly, it's fucking 2015 it should be html5.

Yeah I'll give you that. I plan to not spend any more money on the titans though. I think it'd be funner to do disgusting things to the asics for YouTube in an effort to muddy their brand - would probably be good therapy to get over the complete waste of money they were.

Cross-post showing the psus that my titans set on fire: 
I'm seriously lucky my house didn't burn down.

Is no one caring that those hdds are sitting on top of carpet? Static discharge much?

Fuck kncminer. They knowingly sold extremely dangerous (mine set fire to two psus) hardware (titans) to the public and broke multiple consumer protection laws. It's companies like this that have solidified my belief in the fact that proof of work is the cancer killing cryptocurrencies.

Amen brother! Fuck kncminer!

Like fuck it's profitable. Proof of work is cancer.

I've been thinking about what to do with my titans.. I don't feel comfortable at all with the prospect of selling them since they're such a serious fire hazard.
Do you think we could rally all disgruntled kncminer customers to destroy the devices in crude and barbaric ways to damage their image/rep? Because at this point destroying them might bring me some joy instead of depression.

Yeah, I don't want to waste more of my money on the filth that are kncminer. I'm putting proof of work and the entire ordeal behind me.

Any chance of not using a pdf for this?!

A criminal* company. I can't wait to see them all locked behind bars. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:08:42
Yeah, but I have doubts about any lawsuit being successful against them. Plus kncclassaction looks like a scam for asking money up front. If it was free then I'd be joining in on it.

You should convert to bitusd if you're wanting stability in your paycheck.
