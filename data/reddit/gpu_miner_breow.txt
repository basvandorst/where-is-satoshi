What a complete load of shit I ordered a nano S and it got lost in the mail. I asked them if I could have a to the moon edition for the inconvenience but they said "you have ordered a nano S and you want a nano X as a replacement" all rude like (support). Then they said they can't deliver it to a PO BOX, so they wanted my real address. I asked for a refund. Fuck ledger

Hardware wallet in a fake power point sealed tub (behind the dummy powerpoint) in a wall behind a drawer. A sheet with my pin and 25th passphrase in a bank safety box (I also know this passphrase off my heart). Titanium engraved 24 word seed in a safe at another location. This way family can inherit it by having a trust return the contents of safety deposit box, as well as location of seed. (Also another hidden location of seed at another hidden location just in case titanium one is lost and a passphrase/pin engraved in a different bank safety deposit box just in case contents of another bank is lost (but separate location to the seed), this way they have 2 chances to recover it. Location of all of them will be written in a letter without going into much details, but instructions on how to collect, sealed in a letter at lawyer where they can send to family upon death.

Look at how hard it was to raise 6 million with every YouTuber promoting  so let's go up a few billion dollars with an even smaller community, makes sense

Fellow Bitcoiners, I have figured out how to influence the price.
1. Deposit Fiat into exchanges (Price will jump and keep climbing over the next few days)
2. Buy BTC or Withdraw Fiat (Price goes down and keeps going down!)
Exchanges could be CIA controlled assets and they all communicate with each other on how much is on deposit to manipulate the price so that people buy LUL! Since nothing is regulated is that so far fetched?

This was just me spamming twitch chat on those dates in channels that had 200k+ viewers each.
