Seems like a great way to sell stuff locally with bitcoin as an incentive. I posted silver coins on sale through mycelium with a free 1$ in btc for successfull transaction. Its an experiment but now im thinking of posting other goods and services on it.

That was on Linux Mint 14. I find it to be very clean and productive.

than you would need to register in a pool so you can get a worker and password for it to input it in your program of choice.. than if you want  you can write bash script to either make it in to an icon you click on to start  or as service to auto start on boot so you can avoide constantly typing the command in terminal....

dont panic haha its not stuck. thats just how it works usually when i receive it, takes seconds but the amount shows up in unconfirmed balance. after at least one node validates it the amount goes to my balance, than i just forget about other 5 validations. could take an hour or two but as far as i know transfered coins are in my balance already.

by us you mean the peasants? the definition of royalty is you work and I eat. this is not a popularity contest but a revolution. the world is mad because the 1% of worlds population owns 50% of worlds wealth. the system is nuts and bitcoin is a tool to disrupt old economy and create a transitional path to a better one.

wow how did you get to lizard-people all of a sudden? doomsday prophecy? bitcoin is a tool its how you use it.. do you really think it was created by the powers that be? i beg to differ ...
