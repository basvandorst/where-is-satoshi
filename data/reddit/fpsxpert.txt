You shouldn't be able to. Robinhood is currently in the US only, unfortunately.

Do they do the same crap for personal accounts? I've been needing an excuse to tell Wells to go frig off.

It's at 9K now...don't kid yourself if you think banks don't want the coin to die off.

Yup, it's really funny how my stock-backed IRA has lost $100 in the last month but I've made over $100 mining in the past few weeks. Crypto is making better returns than any stock out there, and Wall Street and their bankers are PISSED. I seriously think some of them are throwing flak like that to hope they can crash the coin, they want it to fail so their stocks and banks will outcome the economic victors.

Transactions from wallet to wallet need to be confirmed much like how a bank tracks transactions on their servers to prevent false transactions from taking place. The fact that I only just learned about these unconfirmed transactions is scary.

Just because you can doesn't mean you should. I owe $4 of BTC to someone but now I can't send it because I can't buy any because Coinbase wont let me sign in. Any alternatives?

That's not gonna stop the FUDsters though from crying wolf to drop prices.
