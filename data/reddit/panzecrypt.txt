I heard about it on dark web, with TOR, bought drugs and others stuffs un silk road, at first i found some bitcoin sellers in darknet forums, and mined some with my computer in 2010-2011, reward was 25 btc per block and with only 1 graphic card (6870) I could mine arround 1 btc/week with a miming pool...
I stopped Bitcoin, miming, darknet and everything in 2013 when mtgox was the place to be, and came back to it late December 2017
I don’t own any btc from when i started.
Funny facts: virwox took me arround 1btc as « inactivity fees » in this period, and I lost some satoshis when silkroad v1 closed.

Don’t really know I think it’s hard times most of altcoins gonna die and bitcoin could go back to 1000$, maybe, some alt gonna survive, the future of blockchain is clear and certain but not crypto’s one as we know/see it...
Still see a bright future for bitcoin and some alts through

Their website said: Talk about blockchain, secure your coin, buy/sell bitcoin, eth, iota, bch, stellar at best prices, monthly 1st Thursday: initiation to crypto's, crypto books and goodies, ... 
A "blockchain/cryptocurency hub" in the downtown of one of the biggest city of France. Looks cool.

ffs... switcheo fiat getaway please...

Btc gonna stay btc my friend, and it’s why he’s strong and not used to be like this, i think it’s good for ecosystem to have different approach of blockchain, a lot of shitcoin for sure but, Eth, Neo, Ont, Eos, Iota, Nano, Elastos, Quant, Litecoin, Icx, .... there is plenty of others challengers, diversity is great, it’s not the good way to centralize

@_date: 2019-06-22 04:07:45

@_date: 2019-06-27 22:23:19
Yep but ur not totally right, I would say that, if it don’t go up, it’s, that it’s going down.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:48:43

U don’t count those who cash out one of them, or cash out everything or just bought one, it’s not maths at this point, it’s been a medium
