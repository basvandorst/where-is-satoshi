Wow, very rude.
A bill can be passed without presidential support, it clearly didn't have actual bipartisan support otherwise it would have been passed.
Also, is that article supposed to be a source? The title of the article literally references the "shithole comment" which is a literal lie, Trump never said that.

Which white house officials? Names? Video recordings that prove Perdue or Cotton acknowledged it in private but not to the media when questioned so we know the "officials" aren't lying? 
Or even better yet, a video recording, hard evidence that Trump himself did say such a thing, I'll give you 0.05BTC if you can get me that.
Not a fan of Trump but a lot things are said of him without any actual evidence. Burden of proof can only reasonably lie on the accuser.

Is there? As far as I know there is neither an audio or video recording. Trump strongly denied he said such things. 
Kirstjen Nielsen, David Perdue, and Tom Cotton said they didn't hear him say it. Lindsey Graham and Mario Diaz neither confirmed or denied anything. Dick Durbin claims he said it. I might be missing a few but I wouldn't call that a consensus. 
Burden of proof is on the accusers, especially because Trump is a controversial figure, otherwise it's just a game of he said she said, not evidence.

It's blatantly obvious BCH is the real Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto said so in a meeting. Rodger Ver confirmed he did.
A video or audio recording that he said that? No I don't have one... But it's blatantly obvious, Rodger Ver isn't biased at all and doesn't lie!
