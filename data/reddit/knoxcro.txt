This might be total horseshit, but awhile back I've read that excluding 2014. (where BTC started the year ~800$, ended ~300$), BTC always grew, with the lowest annual rise of around 35% in 2015. With both years in mind, my moderate estimate would be that within 10 years time, we'll see 50k at least if Segwits sees broader adoption soon, along with Lightning Network and more public acceptance. I expect the volatility on big benchmarks, like 10k, 25k and 50k, but pretty much everyone can agree on that.
Again, this might be horseshit, as it's only my own wishful thinking, because with that prediction I'll be able to retire in about 15 years or at least before my 50th birthday.

Yeah, I know, I plan on moving my BTC from Mycelium to paper, but I can't currently do it in a safe manner. In preparation for that transfer, I'm only wondering should I do it before August 1st or until after the dust settles following UASF activation.

So, I'll have no problems come August 1st if i transfer BTC to paper beforehand and the split happens, I'll have funds on both chains, correct?

I'm currently using Bitcoin Ticker Widget
You can add several cryptos (BTC, LTC, ETH, ETH Classic, Zcash, Monero, Dash, Ripple and NEM) to your portfolio tab and also add other parameters, like when you bought them, sold them, at what price you bought them or sold them, etc. When you set everything up, it sums up your portfolio for each crypto individualy. I use it mostly for that, since I keep my BTC on paper, along with a price widget for several exchanges and several fiat currencies.
