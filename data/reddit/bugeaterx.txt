Don't listen to hater.  Moving these coins is a positive move.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:33:25
I'm with the others. In dollar terms doesn't make sense to buy more.  But I ain't selling!!
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:23:04
You serious?   If $100 makes s difference you don't need either paper or hardware.  Just use a software wallet for you 87 bucks.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:19:58
I'll believe it when I see it.  I have a bad feeling they'll never be able to withdraw bitcoin.  
(At least the guys buying phantom bitcoin have made a great profit lately)
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:01:14
Copay better IMO
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:51:21
Blockchain.info or Copay are excellent web wallets and far superior to coinbase.  Don't leave your coins in coinbase.com.    
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:27:48
We have to do this.  So many newbies don't buy bitcoin because "it's too expensive"
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:15:09
The facts are the facts.  You didn't address the blatant racism. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:20:26
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:10:23
Surprising to see Bitstamp first at $2400. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:12:16
Naw I like this idea a lot 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:52:00
I love people that brag when they make a right move. Like the guy that tells us when he wins at the casino.  But when he loses you hear nada.   
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:24:08
Good article 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:07:04
Sucks bro.  You can keep dwelling but let's be honest. The funds are gone.  You can ruin their reputation but no one is paying you back ever, let alone in bitcoin dominated value.  
Faster you realize this, better your life will be. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:33:23
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:13:16
This is nothing. Percentage is what matters. 
Try $1200 to $800 earlier in the year.  
Try $1200 to $200 through 2014.  
The real Bitcoin supporters stayed through this.  
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:32:59
Questions like this show we need to move to mBTC
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:18:30
Wow.  Terrible attitude.

This is USA dude.  Gambling is do highly regulated it's insane. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:43:20
Uh....no.   It's going to $100,000.  Don't be stupid

Do you have to give your name?

--Governments, banks, and ex-wives can take your bank account money.  Not your crypto
--wires still take 2 days, and not over weekends while Bitcoin will get there and be confirmed in a couple of hours if you spend a dollar.  
--opening a bank account can take a ton of paperwork and time and energy, and overseas many places they won't even allow Americans to open accounts. 
--Visa or mastercard can cancel or freeze your account anytime for any reason. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:38:40
Went from $2300 to $2050 in like an hour.  Now back.  Hopefully that was the pull back.  
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:27:58
Korea was part of Japan at this time in history. Pearl Harbor is the right answer and the reason why the Bitcoin is more expensive.

Please someone open up a competitor and put this company out of business.  
1. good customer service.  1 hour response time .
2. clear rules for verification 
3. no bull on deposits and waiting for purchases 
Is this really only a dream?
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:35:08
Hehehheheeh. I like this 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:19:43
Its coming and obvious 10k will be blown past.

Hehehheheeh.  EXACTLY!!!

No.  Expedia only for flights.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:34:27
A balance on Coinbase just means you own the right to get some bitcoin.  It's not like your specific bitcoin is locked up somewhere.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:18:07
Awesome comment.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:11:29
I'm my experience amounts between 10k and 50k are the amounts that piss people off the most and make someone want to kill.  
People lose 2k or 200k and it doesn't bother them as much. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:14:16
That's what this is.  Activate Segwit today.  2mb blocks a year later.  I love it.  Bitcoin $3000 minimum by Jan 1st 
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:25:28
I hate when these limits are not clearly posted.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:45:19
Still head in fiat ?   Right?
@_date: 2017-05-28 16:25:45
When the code for Bitcoin was written we added a few lines of code to specifically make it more expensive for nonwhites and women.

Put alerts on your phone.  If hits $1800 or $1700 I get an alert. Best thing I ever did for my sanity.

Uh.... he was getting life.  He was 24yrs old and probably thought he was "safe in Thailand.  Someone told him all is well there.  Living normal and rich for years.  Then your life is over.  
I can defiantly see myself ending it. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:48:26
What did he do wrong? 
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:05:34
Exactly.

Forgot to logout?  I'm gonna call bullshit on this part of the story. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:11:02
Wow.  That's a good plan. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:06:04
You're in the wrong investment if you feel this way.  Two options:
 If you can afford to lose $2000 or whatever it is then just let it sit.   Forget about it.  When it hits $10,000 don't sell.  I know someone bought at $250 and sold $800 and was so happy.  Don't be that guy.  
  If you can't afford it take the money out now and forget about bitcoin.  
Worst idea is to play the market. So many bots and pros with huge fortunes and I can promise you with your 1.3 bitcoin have no shot this way. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:20:55
Government just presents a subpoena.  Opens the doors or monitors your cameras all day. Wrong person?  Sorry.  You'll never know.  
We need strong encryption and zero knowledge cloud setups.  We need crypto to protect us for our fellow humans. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:11:20
Yeah but then I read South Carolina is adding. How stupid.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:59:14
Going to $100,000
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:23:58
Baffled me why they didn't just go to 2% and see how things went instead of shutting down.  
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:04:51
Panama.  And if I want to buy something for $5000 it's no one's business.  Not yours, not the government's.   
Maybe I've paid all taxes fully legal but they see this 5k purchase and then decide they need to look at me and raid my house with 20 swat officers looking for "money laundering" (which should not even be a crime).   Then they find nothing and just say "oh, sorry"
Yeah...I think I'd rather pay in cash.   
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:29:21
Interesting theory.  Not sure I agree but you have some solid pts 
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:35:32
Agreed

Funny thing is if Trump leaves the biggest winners will be the Republicans.   
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:08:14
Wow.  Well how about the poor citizens of Cyprus and Greece who woke up one day and all bank and ATM withdrawals were either not working or very limited.  
Then the bank just stole 30% off the top on Cyprus bank holders.  
Trusting governments and banks is just dumb. They've failed us over and over and history will repeat itself. 
This is the whole reason WHY  Bitcoin is so amazing and why we all support it so strongly.  It's trustless.  It's fair. It's honest and it's private.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:14:50
That's a whole other thread.  
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:31:14
Segwit will take us to $3000 for sure

Copay app rocks.  Open source baby!
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:30:04
Did you read what he said?  He's supporting Segwitx2. He said only if they back out of the agreement is the only way he'll back out.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:01:38
Can't you get in GDAX or how does that work?
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:27:35
MSB licences are not needed and should be abolished.  Two states don't have them and those states get along just fine.  Selling Bitcoin to  friend is no one else's business. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 19:31:40
Exactly.  Why we don't adding a value to each node based on number of Bitcoin I have no idea.  Would be the easiest way to decide everything.  
And if you own bitcoin you ain't gonna vote against your own best interests.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:03:35
Wow.  This comment is disgusting. How about people that don't want their every single life transaction recorded?  Heard of privacy?  Heard of government overreach?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:13:55
Cheapair and Destinia is for real. 
The rest I don't believe.  BTCTRIP for sure is a complete joke.  
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:33:55

Unfortunately they just come get you.

How is US based a positive? 
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:04:52
What?  Link?
@_date: 2017-05-12 00:08:09
This is dumb 
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:02:00
Government's never make mistakes?  Ever?  Read how many bank accounts have been frozen wrongly.  Read about how many doors been knocked down incorrectly.  
Happens all the time and ruins the lives for innocent people for years.  And then once they've made the mistake they'll make up anything you've done wrong to avoid guilt.  Unless you've lived the perfect life forget about it.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:30:52
Not even sure prepaid cards were accepted at Circle back in the day.  Don't think they ever have been and certainly not for 4%
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:08:29
Huge win if you ask me. Brilliant compromise. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:24:58
$5 million should be enough at age 40 to never have to work again.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:38:36
What a joke 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:14:41
Heheheheheh.  So so so true. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:14:14
So the government steals less of your money. Win for me 
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:38:06
Your fault man.  Never ever send funds FROM coinbase ever.  Gambling sites are stupid and don't mix their funds.  
Coinbase to Blockchain.info to whatever site you want    
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:47:52
I don't dent you nailed this one. 
I'm skeptical you're honest with yourself and others when you fail.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:21:59
Which cloud provider?  I've been adviced to use "encrypted" and zero knowledge cloud back ups.  Did you have this?
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:15:42
They do back Segwit.  But they also back bigger blocks. Just want the damn problem solved!
@_date: 2017-06-26 02:00:06
It was well worth the time to save a couple dollars?
@_date: 2017-06-07 03:17:45
Awesome.  Some people will never understand this concept.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:37:05
Yeah.  He's wondering about how to buy $500 worth due to the fact that bitcoin is $2000+  we should make bitcoin. Worth $2 instead 
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:58:11
Good explanation. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:18:14
I don't know how much you sell but I hear this from people all the time.  
Just buy gift cards and pay for flights and hotels.  There's so much you can pay for with Bitcoin. 
Get a BITPAY debit card for the rest.  Goto ATM
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:13:16
I'd seriously buy a Tesla win Bitcoin if he did this just to show support.
