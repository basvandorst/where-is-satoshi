Gonna stick it to the man by giving my money to Goldman Sachs instead!

I've heard roughly $3000-$7000 depending on your country. That's the cost of electricity and doesn't include hardware costs. (disclaimer, I'm not a miner myself)

If you like low and stable inflation, why not use fiat currency?

Peter Thiel famously wanted to buy blood from young people and get it transfused into himself as a potion of youth. I think he's also big on the idea of uploading your consciousness into a computer. Basically he's really on board with the dystopian sci-fi future where rich people can buy immortality at the expense of poor people.

Why would they integrate crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:21:36
No, and it's not because of the SEC or the Dow either. It's because a lot of people who got into Bitcoin just to see the price go up are getting out all at once.
And tbh, as long as people have to convert their btc back to real currency when they actually want to spend money on anything, btc's value will be totally hype-driven.

What makes you think there's a "bigger change" coming up? You can't even pay for a coffee with bitcoin, much less use it to denominate contracts.

The algorithm governs the supply of BTC. It doesn't back it.

If history repeats itself, Bitcoin will hit $20,000 again. That would be a repetition. Bitcoin hitting $330,000 would be an insane new breakthrough beyond anything ever seen before, requiring a whole lot of people who've never so much as considered buying bitcoin to plunge titanic amounts of money into it.

Those runs only look alike in terms of % growth. They're completely different in terms of how much money was actually being put into crypto, who was buying, and their motivations. The run-up to 20k was different from anything that came before it, and getting to 300k would be different again.
It's like saying that since Jeff Bezos can go from being worth $1M to $100B, he'll be worth $10 trillion in another 20 years. That's a whole new ball game!

Last time I asked this question I got several people saying, almost literally, "you can't know they DON'T have 1.8 billion dollars." That was before they were uncoupled from USD on that one platform, maybe that changed some minds.

Yeah, it's weird that they paid a law firm to check their bank balance on exactly one day (and IIRC, Tether knew the date in advance). I'd feel better if FSS checked on random days over a full fiscal year, or at least a quarter. Or, y'know, if they followed the same kind of accounting standards that any other large public company is held to.
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:39:24
That is exactly the problem.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:38:20
But really, it's a currency, so it doesn't actually matter what people think it's wo... oh, wait. That is, still, literally the only thing that matters.

That's incredibly implausible. Gold was seen as a safe haven back in 2008 and its price rose by about 300%, which if it happened to bitcoin today would put us at.. $10,000. 2008 didn't turn into a gigantic speculative bubble where gold was suddenly worth $100,000 per pound because pension funds thought it would replace the dollar or whatever.
If bitcoin actually is being used as a currency by 2020, a sudden bull market would be the worst possible thing to happen to it, because who's going to spend their coins on pizza when they're skyrocketing up in value?
