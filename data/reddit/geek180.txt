You mean within credit cards? I think one issue with that is most of the people with that capability aren't even aware of it. Applepay being a major feature in new iPhones will at least increase awareness of NFC.

woah what!? This statement clearly shows you have no idea what you're talking about. One of the biggest parts of the libertarian platform is ending the drug war and decriminalizing all drugs. Most libertarians feel the same way about abortions.

I don't believe he founded SR. he just acquired it and then ran it like it idiot.

I have a really hard time believing 91% of phones are android. Or am I misunderstanding the stat?

Woah tell me more

And adding a new credit card has been broken for days. I'm about ready to transfer my wallet from DGAX to Bittrex, this is just stupid at this point.

yup. they have dropped the ball so hard.

Asking if a bed frame is quiet or not is the most adult thing I've ever heard.

Sounds less like an "Apple" problem, and more of an issue of nobody developing good crypto apps for iOS.

What's seriously insane about that is economy/trade = world peace.

Oh ok. What type of apps specifically have they been banning? Like what does the android market have that the iOS market doesn't? I do have a few crypto apps on my phone but it's mostly just apps that feed me data about the currencies (values, hash rate, difficulty), rather than actual trading or account management.

Do merchants set the static price in USD?
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:32:32
How will stores accept a currency that drastically changes value every day? Will the price in bitcoins simply be equated to the USD value of the item? Will the items' bitcoin price be updated everyday the bitcoin value goes up or down a significant amount?

I'm not sure if that's so much a "bitcoin" thing, but rather just a theoretical computer hacking technique.
