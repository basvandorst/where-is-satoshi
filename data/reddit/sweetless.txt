How were you using your account? Can you tell us a bit more about that? What did you do with your bitcoins?
@_date: 2016-04-15 19:23:24
Bitstamp probably did not terminate your account for no apparent reason, Bitstamp probably terminated your account because they had a good reason. Now-a-days exchanges don't "just" close your account because they feel like it. How were you using your bitcoins? Can you tell us a little more about that?

to which European market were you selling bitcoins to? How do you know you are totally within the law?

Can you explain a bit more how were you using your account? What were you doing with your bitcoins?

They will send you your money back, you just need to give them a different bank account. You can clearly see that they cannot use the one they have and it is probably not even a problem with your bank but an intermediary bank. Do you have any clues as to why they would close your account? How were you using it?

Stop bsing and tell us WHY are they closing your account? Did you do something wrong? Maybe faked your documentation? 'Cos that would be illegal too you know. Send them proper docs and get your ass verified and you will be just fine. I did and I had no problems.

You still did not answer my question though. Did you use proper documents for verification? You say, you did nothing...you had to do something, you had to give them some kind of reason for such actions, because I think they won't "JUST" seize your money for no apparent reason. Like I said, I verified myself and all is good. And if you know they did...sue them. It's your money.

Bitstamp is not a storage facility nor they are a bank. Deposit / Buy / Withdraw + trade in between. If you want to safekeep your coins..put them in your own safehouse.

Which liabilities?
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:31:37
Is this the address the stolen bitcoins are going too?
Looks more than 500

You used to do whatever you wanted before Sept 2013 @ Stamp, than they made verification changes and notified ALL users (me included). Had you complied everything was fine, you got your coins your money, everything. Got the KYC questions, answered them and went on doing business. Absolutely not a problem for me, but then again I have nothing to hide. Don't kick them in their ass just because they have regulations...I think that is actually a good thing because this way you get rid of all those rats who do have something to hide and it gives me the feeling that they know what they are doing and trust is a big deal for me...I have no problem sending 5 / 6 digit figures to them and investing...but that's just me I guess. I had to verify my account so I did. Stamp has been informant from the get go and they take OUR money seriously. For christ sake, verify your account and take your business elsewhere if you do not like Stamp. I've listened and read about "being Stamped" and "Gox 2.0" for too long, from people who obviously have an issue and should I dare say "law issues". I ask myself, why?? Now ask yourself the same question. Do you have something to hide? No? Get your ass verified than and your problems will disappear.

Nice gesture I would say! Got the same e-mail previous time around. 
Stamp got hacked, they survived and on top they covered all their loss, so we were actualy not affected. Props to that! 
They implemented better security and are now apparently expanding to US and Canada with Vogogo.
Stamp keep up the good work, and for all you non believers; if you trade elsewhere stop complaining.

I think the only one insolvent is you because you have no idea what you are saying.
@_date: 2015-01-17 09:43:13
I made a wire withdrawal and received it without any issues. It took 4 days to receive.
@_date: 2015-04-17 09:24:49
This is insolvency at it's best!
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:47:14
They closed your account? You probably did something wrong would be my thinking...
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:47:15
why not...they are the most reliable exchange on the market. Bitfinex is sinking like a Titanic, slowly but surely...
@_date: 2015-03-30 13:55:38
Coinbase has 0% deposit fees? That's great...I thought they had just a 1% fee for each transfer from bitcoin to dollars/euro or from dollars/euro to bitcoin.

the only thing fake is your accusation...

Excellent news!
