One example is he spoofed information about users sharing warez  on his BBS and gave it to authorities when he was in trouble. Another example is his insider trading in the dotcom bubble. How you think he came to wealth? Just figured the german wikipedia is more precise on his early activities but google translation has some misleading wordings.
Career [ Edit | Source Edit ]
Kim Dotcom attended the Heinrich-Harms-school (secondary school) in Ploen and grew by its own account in one of the alcoholism on embossed his father problematic family. [6] Dotcom entered the mid-1990s for the first time as a computer hacker to the public , For great sensation made ​​his demonstration of the blue-box method in the WDR - TV Program Monitor . He was a member of the then flourishing mailbox scene with its mailboxes Beverly Hills BBS and House of Coolness BBS , where among other Warez were traded. It is the message of the users of its box have recorded and in this way of hackers have experienced insider information on weaknesses in the telephone system and software. [7] Pay he was, among other things with stolen calling card data, which he resold. [7] Later he ran a partyline who viewed the Forum of phreakers developed and in which he again collected to date information by listening to its users.
Dotcom started based on this information in the production of magnetic cards with fake payment information. In a search warrant on suspicion of black copies in the mailboxes were with him "hundreds of fake credit and phone cards" found. [8] Dotcom changed under the pressure of criminal investigations, the pages and gave information about the Schwarzkopie- and credit card scene investigators continue , He worked in the result for the lawyer Guenter baron von Gravenreuth and provided this information on Black copies. He was also active as a test purchaser to trademark infringements uncover. [9] This activity was recognized in the process in his favor, so he decided in 1994 for fraud, computer fraud, commercial air bands receiving stolen property and misuse of titles was sentenced to a youth sentence of two years probation. [10]
Kim Dotcom (September 1996)
Dotcom era [ Edit | Source Edit ]
According to Dotcom he got from an acquaintance from the scene evidence of vulnerability in the GSM system of German Telekom mobile D-1 (now Telekom Germany GmbH ). In exchange for silence, he received a consulting contract with DeTeMobil. [8] With the proceeds from the consultancy agreement Dotcom founded in Munich the company Data Protect Consulting GmbH , [11] he finally to 80 percent at the TÜV Rheinland sold. Dotcom retained 20 percent of the shares. The GmbH filed for bankruptcy in 2001. [12]
In a 2001 interview he claimed, systems of Citibank hacked and 20 million US dollars to Greenpeace to have paid what Greenpeace denied referring to his account reports. [13]
Insider Trading [ Edit | Source Edit ]
In 2001, Dotcom said the ailing company letsbuyit.com with 50 million euros to help bounce back. [14] This payment should have the newly formed venture capital firm Kimvestor AG [15] carried out. The company caused a scandal by alleged lack of legal capacity, incomplete information brochures for shareholders , shares without voting rights consistently, once switched on and once absagende supervisory boards and dubious liquidity. [16] The announced investment was never made. Since the price had shot up one day prior to the announcement of the interim financing, which took Procuratorate investigation on insider trading.
During this time he also struck by various public campaigns. So he sat, for example a reward on Osama bin Laden from [17] , claiming the FBI cooperate. The organization he founded Young Intelligent Hackers Against Terrorism (Yihat), which should enter into terrorists used networks and computers could, reported no success. Instead, that was site of the group multiply itself from other hackers tampered with . [18]
In January 2002, he fled to the Thai capital Bangkok and built a new website, which could be understood as a suicide notice. Instead, he presented on the date when King Kimble the First, Ruler of the Kimpire ( "King Kimble the first ruler of Kimperiums"). [13] On 18 January 2002, he was arrested in Thailand [19] and with his consent shipped to Germany. It was approved by on 27 May 2002 Amtsgericht München for insider trading to one year and eight months imprisonment to probation convicted and 100,000 euro fine. [20] [21] The court found Dotcom guilty on insider transactions with shares of the company letsbuyit.com N , V. to have achieved approximately one million euro profit. [22]
Following his conviction Dotcom moved to Hong Kong [13] and announced several new businesses, among them the company Trendax Inc. , which should generate by means of artificial intelligence guaranteed stock market gains. [23] In addition, raised his lifestyle media attention. End of 2004 planned Dotcom a seven-day road rally called Ultimate Rally in 2006, [24] which never took place.
In early 2007, the web presences of dotcoms previous projects such. B. Kimpire and Trendax , as well as its website kimble.org from the web away. The end of 2007 published reports that it with the Sharehoster Megaupload brought in connection. [25] Dotcom offered the scene portal gulli.com money in the form of a line item, so the connection will not be published. [26]
In February 2010 Dotcom signed a lease for the Chrisco Mansion [27] in Coatesville with the option off, New Zealand to purchase expensive private property worth 15 million euros later. [28] Since then Dotcom no longer appears under the name Kim Schmitz , but as Kim dotcom on. [29] According to an article of the magazine Investigate April 2010 dotcom is in the company archives of Hong Kong under the name Kim Tim Jim Vestor recorded. Supposedly he acts as director of, among other Megaupload Ltd. and Megarotic Ltd. [30]
As co-founder of Megaupload Dotcom in 2011 for alleged copyright infringement by the company Perfect 10 , which operates in the field of copyright erotic art and media on 5 million US dollar compensation sued. [31] [32] [33] The trial ended with a comparison of an unknown amount. [34]

Dear Bitcoiners: The anonymous currency "Bit Coin" is just another pyramid scheme. The only profiteers are the ones who got in early. Everyone else will lose all their money because it will collapse and fall to $0 any time soon. It is wildly used for buying illicit goods and fund terrorist attacks. That's why Governments  will declare it illegal and shut it down. It is created out of thin air anyway and offers no value at all. So, keep dreaming and post stupid jokes so we can all laugh about you next year. Recently I heard the CEO of bit coin got arrested again for money laundering so get out while you still can. 
Bit coin is so dead!
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:52:55

Core only uses a fraction of my 2 GB RAM. CPU on the other hand is always on the limit. It basically uses all processing power available. A browser with 5-10 tabs open, slows it down 20-30%. So most of the time bitcoind is the only program running except a few terminal windows. My guess is other processes are slowing down core on your machines.

As I said, download the linux binary from [bitcoincore.org]( or from github. Extract the file(Rightclick&gt;Extract Here should work). Now just go into that folder and click the bitcoin-qt file. It will run from here, no need to install.
Alternativly in the comandline it goes something like:
$tar xf file.tar.xz
$cd bitcoin/bin

Not a Ubuntu user and not aware of that addresses not showing up problem, but as a linux vet I have
3 guesses:
1. your bitcoin core version is corrupted.
2. software not running propperly on the very new 18.04 ubuntu kernel(I don't know).
3. backups are actually corrupted.
1. remove current bitcoin core version. install Ubuntu PPA version or linux binary from [bitcoincore.org]( . delete everything from .bitcoin folder and start from scratch.
2. install a fresh Ubuntu 16.04(or other well tested distro) and then install the PPA or the binary.
3. Make sure it still works in win7. If it doesn't, well...

Thanks for replying. Dont get me wrong, I like paperwallets too and I was talking long-term storage as well. Actually I wanted to hear why you wouldn't trust trezor on that purpose. The spending part was additional. Lets say you need to spend x amount from cold storage because 'add reason'. Unless you have several paperwallets with different amounts you'll need to import a bigger amount than you want to spend to your online wallet. Spend the desired amount and send the rest back in cold storage. Quite nasty, I know, but thats the way it is.

I had a subscription back in 2013. S3051 and AKWanalytics are well known figures in bitcoinland and they definitely know the market. I didn't know much about trading back then but I learned quite something. I think it's too expensive though for what you get, maybe that changed in the meantime, I don't know. If you already know everything about trading, support/resistance zones and trends but struggle to read bitcoin charts then give them a try anyway. They made pretty good calls on the run-up to 1000. They tend to be too bullish though. When everyone else was screaming BEAR they were still bullish as hell until it was obvious to everyone. I was kind of disappointed as there was no "sorry" just a "oh yeah, we are in a bear trend now". No kidding? Also you have to learn some basics on how to read their report. Sometimes I misinterpreted their words and sometimes I was confused as there was no update for days after a big move when I didn't know whats going on. I still like to read their free reports as it's always good to calibrate your sensors.

First of all you shouldn't run bitcoind as root. create a user Kitten-Smuggler and mount your second drive to /media/Kitten-Smuggler/ ! If you can't figure that out yourself, you probably shouldn't run your own Linux Server.
Next, you screwed up a little but don't worry, you just have to download the blockchain again. From what I read you tried to move the blockchain to your second drive but somehow that failed because it's neither in your root nor in /mnt/data. Also the error just means your bitcoind is not running (I think).
So, here is what I would do to just get it running again:
As others mentioned you can use the datadir method OR what I like to do is create a symbolic link with ln -s.
 
Basically you have to do this:
\ .bitcoin /mnt/data/
\ -s /mnt/data/.bitcoin .bitcoin
\ -daemon (response will be "Bitcoin server starting" and blockchain will be stored in /mnt/data/.bitcoin from now)
\ getinfo
Friendly reminder: never, NEVER ever let some stranger from the internet or anyone else ssh into your machine.

Depends on size of transaction and unconfirmed txs in the Mempool.
For example: Your spending address has 4 inputs and the size is ~600bytes. Check Mempool for unconfirmed txs at bitcoinfees.21.co for example. 200sat/byte usually is enough these days to make it in the next few blocks. 200x600=120000 satoshis. There you got your fee. Use less for low priority transactions but beware. If you choose too low, chances are it doesn't get picked up at all. This is expert level.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:52:40
Even if that would be the case. If the choice is:

Much has been said already. IMHO one is the real deal, the other one is a scam. Apparently you need to draw your own conclusions. Not saying either segwit or bigger blocks are bad. You need to ask you this: Does the code actually work and doesn't break bitcoin. who is sticking to facts and who is spreading FUD and misinformation.
Just in case you want my opinion:
Core Developers are the real deal(they deliver stable, backwards-compatible code and care about decentralisation).
Segwit is the real deal(long term tested and peer-reviewed, stable code that is already implemented in several altcoins without issues. More than doubles capacity without raising blocksize).
Bitcoin Unlimited and sorts are scams(code has lot of flaws and breaks every now and then. Despite that it increases the risk of centralisation and gives miners even more power to dictate future development).
Segwit2x is controversial(still vaporware, rushed thru and has few developers).
Roger Ver,  Falkvinge, Craig Wright, Gavin and sorts are scammers(spreading FUD and misinformation).
Some examples:
Craig Wright: I am Satoshi Nakamoto!
Gavin Andresen: Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto!
Rick Falkvinge: Segwit is patented!
Roger Ver: Bitcoin Genesis Block was first ICO!
Many of them constantly hate on Adam Back, other Core Developers and supporters.
I personally can't read rbtc without smh. It's just embarrassing.
recent nonsense they spread:
anyonecanspend segwit transactions, segwit is patented, non-mining nodes don't matter, Bitcoin was an ICO
But, that's just my opinion, man.

Abandoned ship in 2015 when they announced no further development and I also had some problems. I know goatpig took over the project and there is a Armory thread over at bitcointalk where you'll get more help, eventually. Can't help you with the export but I have a hint for you. If your Database isn't syncing, you may have to upgrade your RAM. Armory is very RAM hungry. 2GB was just enough for me. That was  in 2015 so you may need 4GB what was the recommendation back then. Good luck!
