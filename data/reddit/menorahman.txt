And just to be a thousand percent sure I'm not breaking any ethics rules by posting here... (I'm not expecting business from this, more just a dialogue about the legal field becoming a more solid member of the bitcoin community and wanted to finally make a post in the subreddit I lurk in the most...but since it links to my website...)
This is an attorney advertisement.

No, but I just checked out their website and it seems interesting indeed. Thanks for the tip!

No...but many of the programmers I work with ARE usually pretty high.

It really just boils down to our rules of professional conduct. The legal industry knows how most people view it and they are trying to change that. In New York for example, pretty much ANY communication to a non-client or non-friend needs to say it's an attorney advertisement. This is (I believe) to prevent snake attorneys from talking friendly to a potential client and tricking them into giving them more business than they would/need. 
The bad guys are few and far between nowadays, but they're out there. So as annoying as it is, happy the profession is trying to cut down even more on them.

I help a lot of indie developers and app creators get off the ground and protected the right way. Usually they just hire an "entertainment" attorney, but if you don't know how to write an internet or game friendly contract, you are shooting yourself in the foot. Look at Riot's issues with LoL streamers currently. 
Also, I am made of pixels.

I don't do the trolling. I protect against them.

We is the common nomenclature for solo's since we have a broad net of support and our retainers make it clear we help each other on cases that require more manpower or specialized knowledge that someone may be better versed in. I just added the blog and only just added some articles I had written about a year ago for another publication. Do you have to take me seriously? Absolutely not. But those are silly reasons not to do so.
Also, what spelling mistake? I don't see one :) But perhaps I'm blind. ((And that's a PREMIUM wordpress template, har har))

Very glad to hear. And I do hope so as I'm very excited about the idea of this. It's just difficult to sit on the sidelines when you want to play, all for silly reasons.

I read some things saying this was the last secure way to buy. I don't know if that's true, but as a newcomer those words scare me. I'm definitely open to trying something that this community supports though. I know you know your stuff, and I'm still bitcoinless after a week of trying.

Actually been following it for two months. Didn't have investment money until last Monday and was super excited to get in. Didn't try coinbase until Thursday though and they have still not made the bank deposits. But thanks for the answer and I am doing my best to be patient :)
