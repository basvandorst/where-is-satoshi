Oh, so you want me to exchange my btc to bch to buy an S9 from bitmain? mkay

No, thats not how it works
You would have to import the private keys of your BTC wallet that you had BTC sitting in during the fork to a B2X wallet.
But then when you have your B2X coins you cant really move it without risking a B2X tx of yours being replayed on the BTC chain basically putting your BTC at risk

I agree with you man, you cant just go to any computer store thats closest to you and buy an asic which these people seem to think is the case compared to gpus

So if i were to move my BTC to a new wallet of mine from the wallet that i held my BTC in before and after the fork.
Then Import the priv key of my old wallet which my BTC was in before and after the fork to a B2X wallet to get my B2X
And then send a tx of my B2X it wouldnt be able to be replayed on the BTC chain because of the same UTXOs not existing on the BTC chain?
