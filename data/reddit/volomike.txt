*"...is exactly why we need people to take payment with Bitcoin..."*
You'd be nuts to accept Bitcoin as payment on your website with $27-$30+ transaction fees, long transaction times, and huge price fluctuations. BCH is a much better option, but its price changes greatly too. LTC has climbing transaction fees but they're not so bad. To me, the carts of the future will be running LTC. In fact, I'm working on a cart project for a customer, and I'm going to be using LTC as the preferred money. Note when you go to Backpage.com, which, regardless of how you feel about it ethically, is a trendsetter on crypto ecommerce. When you purchase credits from there and choose to purchase with Bitcoin, it shows you LTC as the option on the top and in fact reward you if you use LTC or ETH (with LTC being the one on the top).
Note, I got so mad at BTC transaction fees that I sold all of it for BCH, although I still continue my hedge coins: DASH, LTC, ADA, ANT, QTUM.

What do you think of Nxtcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:06:45
Not nxtcoin.

Look at coinmarketcap.com.

From a legal perspective, I hope he is clear on cryptocurrency in general and doesn't just focus on Bitcoin. And if he says Bitcoin, that's broad because it has versions and is an evolving thing.

Great! Thanks, man! Didn't know this. I hope it comes true.

LOL. Takes ever and a year to synchronize with its blockchain. I gave up on it. Mining also takes forever. What did they do, copy Bitcoin, remove a few of the verifications, and change the name?

Let's compare to US dollars. I pay you $20 USD in really great, bogus cash that even your yellow counterfeit marker detector didn't pick up. You, being a place of business, probably won't turn in that cash until you do a night drop. The next morning, you get a phonecall from the bank that one of the $20s was counterfeit. How much time has passed? Now tell me which was better to process more accurately? Bitcoin or USD?
Let's compare to a credit card. I stole the numbers on that card using a botnet with keyloggers. Being the crafty guy that I'm imagining here, I reverse-engineer the magnetic strip system and print my own fake credit card with someone else's numbers. I pay you $20 USD on this fake card and it goes through just fine. About a week later, the owner of that card finds that bill and claims they never made that charge. They issue a chargeback request that gets approved. You, being the store owner you are, get notified about 4 days after purchase. How much time has passed?
So, I think BTC having to take 50 minutes is far more reliable than credit cards or cash. We've just gotten more used to accepting credit cards and cash as the holy grail of reliability, when they aren't so solid as you might think.

Here's the word list that Electrum uses:
Try restoring a wallet with words not on that list -- Electrum won't let you. Scary thought, huh? Gee, I wonder what happens if I use the first 12 words from this list? Or, use the first 12 words starting with the letter S? Will I get into someone else's wallet?

I've been curious about the cloud mining option too. However, I'd test the waters first with just a modicum of effort and expense to see if I turned a profit from my initial expense, and give it like 4 months before I bailed.

So, the only way to do this is with a third-party website like Blockchain.info? If that's the best way to do it, then I'll do it. Let me know. Looks simple enough.

Electrum uses 12 random words from a predefined list of ~1600 words. Here is that list:
Electrum refuses to let you create a wallet using any seed phrase that contains words not on that list. Don't believe me? Go try it yourself like I did, and you'll get a message that says "Bad Seed" and it won't let you move forward to create that wallet.
Hmmm...doing some thinking here...I guess one could write a script that iterates that word list, putting together 12 words from it, and since one can read the Python source code for Electrum, figure out the algorithm they use to get the private key from the 12 words. Then, it's just a matter of seeing if one can get into that wallet to see if it has coins in it. Might take like 10 home PCs in a room to do it, but eventually I'd think you might find coins.
**Please someone tell me I'm wrong**, because right now I love the Electrum wallet and wish to continue using it.

Not that I believe it. I'm just sharing for you to attack the article as bunk.

Got it. Will do! :)
