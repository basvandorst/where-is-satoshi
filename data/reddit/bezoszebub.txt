the better to obscure the fact of 2018's unrelenting bear market
@_date: 2019-07-05 01:11:01
well...don't take my word for it.  
i still never actually used the app. ...this is mostly just speculation on my part. i was hoping if it was incorrect that someone would let me know.
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:41:54
...lot of terrible reviews from the app stores.    
i finally decided to forget about it when i realized--unless i'm mistaken--that my notion of what it did (the only reason it would be cool) is NOT what it does.  
i was interpreting the concept as being: the moment you earn these small percentages of cash back, the app would somehow convert that into BTC--which you could then hodl in your account there to ride the market...until you decided to withdraw.  
but i don't think it does that at all. i think the whole Bitcoin aspect is just a gimmick. as in, you accumulate the rewards, but they're just promissory amounts--PEI being the only one who benefits on the appreciation while your money sits awaiting cash-out.  
like, say through the week you earned $3 and $5 and $2 and you wanted that to be in BTC. and at the beginning of next week, you decide to cash out to your wallet: well, they give you $10 of BTC..at *that day's* price: you don't get to enjoy gains while the rewards sit in your account.  
and so wtf is the point of that? what i want is something that would automatically buy crypto for me every time i earned spare change. ...otherwise, i could just decide to buy a few dollars of BTC every week my damn self.

from that flyer.
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:00:47
come on, man
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:08:39
...yeah, but you probably would have been dumb enough to ride it through the MtGox crash and lose everything.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:49:55
wow.  
A. Coinbase and Sofi are partners.  
B. You paid Coinbase those fees...only to *rebuy* the same thing elsewhere?  
C. Sofi market prices on all three coins are higher than Coinbase.  
D. You think it's a better idea to hold your crypto somewhere that just started...and doesn't allow transfers...rather than an exchange that's been around for years?
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:17:47
...you really think a (Coinstar) ATM in a mall in suburban SLC is going to be anonymous?  
dude, hiding from the IRS is over.  
...and tax on *gains*? what gains?  
you're gonna fucking lose money on crypto. ...but then guess what: find a "secret" place to buy BTC that the IRS doesn't know about ... and then you won't be able to write off all your *potential losses*, buddy.  
*"Step one in the U.S., crypto ATM operators must register with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FINCEN. Any money services business or MSB must register initially and renew every two years. FINCEN administers the Bank Secrecy Act, or BSA. The purpose of these federal laws is to detect and and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and other financial crimes.  
Step two, businesses are required to keep records of transactions, collect identification information from users, and create compliance policies to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes."*
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:10:59
i just can see no use for Bitcoin ATMs.  
Coinstar is for poor idiots: goddam 12% fee.  
BTC ATM is for rich idiots?  
there's zero reason to have all your money in crypto...so if you need cash fast...just use a normal ATM.  
if you suddenly discovered that BTC was tanking (like this week) and wanted to cash out...just use a normal exchange.  
EDIT: fun fact: Coinstar is the company behind these Coinme ATMs.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:38:27
they ought to at least let you watch a gumball come down a rollercoaster to justify wasting money by using it.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:51:23
yeah...not quite.  
basically, it's pretend-pretend-money.  
you can't deposit or withdraw crypto, but now, along with the 100 different stocks they sell, you can buy and sell--on-site--BTC, ETH, and LTC.  
so, in other words, if you temporarily deposit some fiat with them...then buy $10 of crypto, they'll award you with another $25 of BTC. you can then sell that there...and soon afterwards withdraw that (and buy crypto for real...if that's really what you want to do).
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:54:23


so how do you believe the money gets from your bank to Sofi...magic?  
(i did a transfer, and though i didn't check it hour by hour...it seems like it was simply a next day thing.)  
...but Gemini, for instance, (at least *used to*, as far as i know) allowed you to buy crypto instantly if you wired from your bank.
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:59:19
they'll give you $25 of BTC...so why not?
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:43:40
no...but you can get $25 of BTC free, sell that, and then withdraw the fiat -- which is a hell of a lot better idea than HODLing crypto anyway
@_date: 2019-10-02 07:57:54
its primary draw is fractional-share trading. supposedly this is somehow fee-free.  
...so why not throw BTC, LTC, and ETH into the mix? they make a bit off that by marking up 1.25%.  
it's a one-stop-shop for lazy wannabe daytraders.  
think about it: stock market closes at 4 p.m. ...the rest of the night you can attempt to time crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:20:16
the site is vague on that...probably because it's some ridiculous bullshit.  
but their fee is 4%.
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:35:22
...are you from 2017?  
this may surprise you, but...bankers are the ones making money off these gimmicky crypto gadgets.
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:23:21
prices are actually higher?  
what happened?  
(looking at $2.10 over the past couple of weeks)
@_date: 2019-10-02 20:32:45
7-10 days?! wow. did they get stricter?  
i seem to remember deposits from banks to Coinbase itself only taking 2 or 3 days.  
...Gemini called it a wire, I believe, but it didn't have those ridiculous fees that some banks still want to charge. it was free (and I was using an old-timey bank).  
that was Gemini's big draw...along with (formerly) pretty low fees.

"Walmart" is just for illustration.   
Actually, any place will do. Walmart is rarely the cheapest for almost anything (Ebay, for instance, nearly always beating their prices.)  
"Everything else" ... meaning what?
@_date: 2019-06-23 09:31:24
Food is just plain tricky to calculate.  
I expect their figures come from very specific averages which don't mean a whole lot in the real world. Supermarket prices simply aren't linear--even if you can somehow polish them down across time.  
For instance, the price stamp on a bag of Doritos might be $3...and maybe it used to be 2.79...and maybe next year it will be 3.29. But that's fairly irrelevant to what one will really pay through the year. Today a certain store may offer them for 2.50. The next couple of weeks they may go back to regular price. ...But then some other store may do a deal for $2.00. Sale prices almost entirely determine what I buy. (And if I simply *must* have something at a higher price...I feel compelled to cut my losses the next time there's a sale--*dollar-cost averaging* even my junk-food, you might say.) Of course, most people don't shop that way.  
Another thing, however, is that I don't often buy the "staples"...so I'm not as finely tuned to the going prices for those things--milk, eggs, sugar, salt, flour, chicken, beef, oil. But I think these things too have been fairly constant over the past 10 years or so.    
...With fast food--if you're a real fanatic--one could actually really trace inflation month to month...though, even there, sporadically you can come across huge deals that offset rising prices.  
And, for instance, in the case of pizza...I can say fairly confidently that *those* prices on average are about as low as they've ever been in 25 or 30 years.
TL;DR: Doritos and pizza are inflation-proof.
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:24:40
...so my Walmart receipts are lying to me?
@_date: 2019-10-02 08:01:05
as if everybody didn't already know that--like Coinbase Earn--this is just a desperate play to smokescreen the re-crash.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:09:12
...the market caps of gold and crypto are irrelevant.  
they aren't in competition with one another.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:12:50
you were one of the smart/lucky ones.  
people who didn't take profits then were just being greedy and irrational.  
...but i was talking about December 2018, at the bottom of the pit.   
people who rode it all the way down before cashing out, i expect, just gave up and needed back whatever was left of their money.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:21:40
selling in December wasn't panic: it was facing reality and cashing out to pay bills.  
actual *"panic selling"* was the best decision you could have made in 2018.  
the mistake, perhaps, would just be if those people totally gave up on it and didn't buy back in March and April.  
but who knows? FOMOing now could be a horrible decision.  
there were plenty of big bounces during the crypto winter that came to nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:09:54
...risky, careless maybe.  
but it's not stupid until it doesn't work.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:46:18
...who the hell convinced you that 10,000 was the bottom?  
name names.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:42:33
sound advice.  
...also smoking crack or meth--for diversification.
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:24:48
eh. ...well, just about anything that i buy costs the same as it did in 2018.  
and i can buy much more gasoline with $20 than i could last year.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:15:18
...if you factor in everything, then OK.  
but those are kind of outliers.  
if a couple of sectors go rogue and inflate for no good reason, to me that doesn't really effect the basic value of a dollar.  
just because an iPhone might cost $1000 doesn't make it accurate to say that the cost of "communication" has increased.
