It's not a company, it's a project made up of many people that support p2p trade. Only use BTC if you like, Bech32 segwit addresses are supported and lightning support is being worked on by contributors/volunteers

Use a moderator and you'll be fine

Hey there, we are not part of that team. And I think decentralized marketplaces are a great goal to strive for irregardless of disagreements with some developers. 
There are a lot of disagreements in the community and a lot of different personalities.  At the end of the day there are no other decentralized marketplaces that have made half as much progress as OpenBazaar.

I would like to clarify OpenBazaar is not a company. It would be roughly the same as asking if you work for Bitcoin. It is an open source project with many contributors. It has its roots from the darknet project started by the Bitcoin early adopter/contributor Amir Taaki quite a few years ago. 
The main team most people know are the OB1 company which has developed the majority of the implementation. I do not work for OB1 nor have I received any money from them either, we are two separate companies in the space.
I am the founder of Zokos which is a web implementation of the vendor side of OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar has had contributors add support for altcoins and there is work going on to support a lightning implementation currently.
The code is open source and by far the most advanced decentralized market software out there no matter your opinions on the developer's personal views. If anyone prefers to not support altcoins then many project contributors encourage people that it is their choice and can be done without an issue with the network or by forking the project.

For those who don't know, OpenBazaar has a built-in escrow system that allows vendors to use a third party moderator so that buyers can trust new vendors. If a dispute occurs a moderator steps in and decides which side is right in the dispute and gets the funds.
We just integrated the 2-3 multisig escrow system so users have the option to use direct payments or use a moderator.

It's a priority for the contributors and being developed right now on top of the  [  implementation. I will add lightning support to Zokos as soon as it's available and ready

OpenBazaar itself is an opensource project that has created a  marketplace for people to trade directly without having to rely on any single intermediary. The project has 100's of individual contributors and multiple companies form to support it (similar to Blockstream, Coinbase, Blockchain, etc for Bitcoin).
So, there's controversy because some contributors have their own contentious opinions on Bitcoin. OB1 was the company that raised some funds from Bitmain. And as for OB1, it is a company that contributes code to the project but they are not the 'OB company' or OpenBazaar itself. Similar to how Coinbase is not the 'Bitcoin company' or Bitcoin itself.
The company (us) that open sourced this code for OpenBazaar has taken no money from any company and we're 100% self-funded. We just believe OpenBazaar is by far the most advanced open-market project out there. Imo it's a great project with a lot of promise in the future for making trade free.

OpenBazaar is not a single company or uniform. IIRC it was Brian that expressed some interest in 2x. Brian is the CEO of a single company on the project. 
The project has a lot of contributors and multiple companies working on it, his opinion was never the project's overall view. OpenBazaar goes all the way back to Amir Taaki's darknetmarket + dozens of independent contributors since then - [

I think the moonboy/lambo demographic peaks at every bull market and slowly leaves as bitcoin enters its bear market. If you were around last year you can probably notice that there are way less memes about the price and more tech/adoption-focused articles on the front page. I generally take that as a good sign of bitcoin's future direction
