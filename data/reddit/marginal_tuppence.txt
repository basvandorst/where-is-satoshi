A lot of small blockers are speculating and pumping ethereum now. that's why the price has fallen: first because people selling etc are cashing out through bitcoin, second because the total lack of any growth in bitcoin is pushing investment elsewhere.
Expect the trend to reverse as soon as there is a big dump of etc, once we either get positive news about scaling plans from California and/or the miners realize that this is what the slide to irrelevance looks like and hint at a hard fork.

Apparently... I wasn't trying to shill. Just trying to think about how to structure something like with this BTC. It is an excellent idea.

Doomsday scenario is totally possible. Price surge makes hash crash a lot less likely though.

1 MB blocks aren't enough to support the transactions generated by a decent-sized mall, to say nothing of a developing country. Crypto as an asset class may grow, but bitcoin won't do much until Core bothers to increase the blocksize or they get dumped by miners getting freaked out by alt-coin growth.

This sounds like something that could be setup with smart contracts on ethereum, actually.

Write a script that looks up the full address history for all addresses that receive coins. Once the script is running send the account you're interested in a few satoshis so that it shows up in the pool for processing. You'll be blocked as spam.

Not sure what you are saying... accumulating BTC isn't even a consideration for my business because we can always just purchase whatever cryptocurrencies we need. Bitcoin support is simply a way to save money over using paypal or credit cards for most customers.
Anyway, that there are hidden costs with higher fees and businesses pass those onto customers. On a separate note, we are also seeing some transaction volume is shifting to ethereum as a result of the fee market, although that seems less because of fees and more because our customers don't want to wait a couple of hours for their transaction to confirm.

I've had 10 cent transactions take 28 hours.

Why would anyone buy a ton of ethereum and then vote against the hard fork? It would be like buying bitcoin and tossing it into the shredder. It is totally obvious that letting someone steal 50 million from developers is not going to help the coin.
The people with significant assets are the same ones with significant risk and exposure. The fact that the market is responding positively to the move is evident that their choices align with those of smaller asset-holders and reflect what is publicly perceived as best for Ethereum in the long-term.

I think you meant:
"Let me issue and control a blockchain's softforks and I care not who writes the code."
At least with a hard fork the market gets to vote.

Bitcoin fees are already very high compared to alternative payment methods. It's already significantly cheaper to send 20 bucks through Paypal or Alipay.

What exactly are the legal grounds for the United States prosecuting a law-abiding US-incorporated bank for the actions of a foreign bank?

Not disagreeing. Worth noting that if revealing your public key makes your private key more vulnerable all multi-sig transactions are vulnerable to the party that creates them. If bitcoin becomes vulnerable to this sort of thing a total-upgrade of the security aspects through HF would be called for.

I don't understand how Peter Todd's logic work.
Coinbase is selling ETH. And they waited until after the fork to start selling it. So on what grounds can Peter Todd claim they owe anyone ETC? There may well be ghost transactions on the ETC chain, but why should Coinbase care?

his calculator was coded by Core devs: it has trouble scaling and makes ambitious estimates.

No kidding. If the average purchase is 20 bucks and fees are at 20 cents, that's 1 percent in fees just to transfer the cash to the customer.
The problem will get worse for businesses that accept bitcoin, since they'll need to pay both to transfer funds to the exchange as well as in exchange fees as the exchanges deal with higher fees themselves.
