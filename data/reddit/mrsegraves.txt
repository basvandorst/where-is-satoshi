I know you're joking in this instance, but is that actually a real thing and if it is, can you do an ELI5? I'm not sure how deep the joke goes but I would like to learn

That was perfect! I learned something. It reminded me of some of the hijinks in the Big Short, honestly.

Would you be interested in starting a non-profit medical cannabis cannabis company? There are many patients who have trouble affording their medication due to the lack of insurance coverage for cannabis. Those who need large quantities daily, such as those suffering from epilepsy or cancer are especially in need of support. Additionally, there are many parents across the US who would like to move to states that offer legal access to their child's medication but simply can not afford to move, forcing them to rely on ineffective pharmaceuticals or to break the law (in some cases at great risk to their own safety and freedom).

I sense a distinct failure to elaborate on your point...

Just because it isn't BTC doesn't make it any less worthy of interest. Dogecoin may have started as a joke and the community may still be full of happy, friendly jokers, but the coin is actually serious now. It sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics. It sent an Indian luger to the Olympics. It can be used to purchase physical items. It's being accepted on Chinese exchanges. And the doge is on the rise against the BTC and USD, while BTC is down against the USD. And that's AFTER the halvening!

How did he trap them? He gave them his email and they did something stupid. He may have kept the conversation going after that, but in what way was it ever a 'trap?'

Hardly an elaboration on your initial statement.

I'm not a dogetard. I own doges, yes. But I also own BTC, LTC, PPC, and QRK. It's called diversifying, and it'll save your ass if one of them crashes.

I've had an account with them for 3 years, hadn't used it for about a year. They wanted me to revalidate my identity. The screen to upload those IDs was straight up broken on the app, the mobile website, and the desktop website. Their help desk kept sending me a stock response that I needed to do the exact thing I was doing that did not work. I have about $300 held hostage by their shitty system
