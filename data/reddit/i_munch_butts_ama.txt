It's already used more than gold though as a currency. 
If you think 'data' means anything in investing you're in for a sharp reality check. If anyone could just pull up some data and predict stock pricing, we'd all be rich. I'd like to see this multitude of data you're talking about.
You're speculating that the value of tesla will increase based on the technology behind it hopefully improving in the future so it becomes more viable to the average person and something better doesn't come along. 
Replace tesla with Bitcoin in that statement and it's the same thing.
Just because there isn't a centralized company behind Bitcoin doesn't mean the same thing can't apply. Phrase it however you want, but the comparison is nearly identical at its core.
For Bitcoin value to go up, there needs to be more adoption. For there to be more adoption, there needs to be improved technology and cheaper fees.
For tesla value to go up, there needs to be more people buying teslas. For more people to buy teslas, there needs to be cheaper models, which requires progression of technology.
Saying anyone who thinks Bitcoin could be adopted as a viable everyday currency is delusional is just silly. It's better than usd in every way when it works as intended, there are just hurdles that need to be addressed. Same thing with teslas (actually there's an argument to be made that there's far more negatives when comparing a tesla to a traditional gas car vs Bitcoin to traditional currency), there's no reasons for people not to drive an electric car vs a gas car, but there's hurdles that need to be addressed before there's mass adoption. (environmental footprint of manufacturing batteries, cost)
Yes, tesla has shown they are developing tech to address these issues, but the exact same can be said about Bitcoin (segwit, lightning)

So Bitcoin is a bubble because of speculation but tesla isn't because you are speculating that it wi profit in the future?
How is saying half the cars in the future will be tesla any different from saying half the currency used in the future will be Bitcoin?

I see what you're saying, and I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but while the stock value can be valued in relation to how a company is doing and it's not speculative that if a company does well its stock will do well, is it not speculation of how the company will perform? You can't loop that around again and say the company will do well because the stock is doing well. 
You're talking almost as if stocks can't lose value or a company can't perform as well as projected. It isn't any less of a gamble, there's just a lot less to gain (or lose).
If a company doesn't perform as well as your faith leads you to believe, nothing is backing its return, either. Your apple example is backwards. Sure, if a huge company that is performing well suddenly has an extremely undervalued stock, it will come back up, but when does a major company like apple randomly have a giant dip in stock value if they are performing just as well? Never. Stock market crashes, however, happen all the time (just look at 2015). When bitcoin has these 'crashes', it hasn't wiped out a years worth of gains, and doesn't take nearly as long to recover. Sure, the past isn't indicative of the future, but the same could be said about the whole basis of your argument.
At what point do you say the bubble has 'popped'?
in 2013 it fell 70%
Aug 2016 it fell 40%
Jun 2017 it fell 40%
Sep 2017 it fell 40%
Apr 2017 it fell 35%
Nov 2017 it fell 30%
Dec 2017 it fell 25%
The drops are only getting smaller... do you not consider a 70% dip a bubble bursting? Granted, that wasn't as extreme of growth within a year, but then is 40% not a pop? 30%? How many 30% dips in a year does it have to have before it doesn't recover, because we are at **5** now. How could it not correct after going up over 1000% this year? There are undoubtedly a ton of people in it for the wrong reasons, but as of right now it seems there's a stronger force of people who believe in it and are backing it.

I'm not claiming crypto has no risk. My whole point was that your criticism of crypto was that its value only comes from speculation, but you're doing the same with stocks.

Hey 10,200 here
I remember seeing the shit memes of grandpas with "I invested at 10,000" memes. I went all in and the profit is wonderful.
However, it isn't profit until you cash out.

If you really want to gamble you can try day trading, but you might lose money or at least miss out. Otherwise, keep your money in Bitcoin and watch it grow.

...and he's actively pointing out flaws of both the developers and the community. He's actively being a member of the community that is encouraging these flaws to be fixed. If everyone insisted on that, the community would be much better off.

It's gambling.
You can buy on small dips and sell on small peaks and come out the other end, usually not huge amounts. You can make a little bit of Bitcoin daytrading, but the only way it's going to have any significant value is if you hodl.
If you were to make good money day trading, you would either have to be very very lucky and sell at ath and buy on big dips or risk a lot of money. When I was daytrading like 1k at a time I maybe made $20 on a good day. More worth it to just invest and hodl.

The fluctuating prices all day have netted me some tasty gains.

Ah fuck off man, it's not rocket science. I'm up 5% just today from day trading. The price goes up, and then it goes down. It's basic economics. I've just been selling around ~9900 and buying at -9500 and multiplying my Bitcoin.
