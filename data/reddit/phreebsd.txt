Mostly.  Kinda.  Thank you.  I believe so.  Possibly not, but I believe it!

How constructive of you, malevolent sir.  I suppose in your undoubtedly numerous adventures of being a crypto pauper living from day to day riding the edge of the volatile beast that you've experienced much enlightenment which far transcends what one would obtain in a normal setting, taking the whims for granted.  Please, almighty wielder of the crystal ball of Intuitive Knowledge of Others, shine your light my way and make known to me the answer of what it is to not laze about and to see the path of conversion your way, the way of the nontard.
tl;dr: kindly fellatiate ones self followed by prematurely terminating ones own life force.

I've heard of bitstamp, but never used either of those 3.  Thank you for turning me on to them-- another issue has been a central source for trusted/accredited sites and those which are scams.

I do now have pizza coming :] -- Coinbase is a good suggestion, thank you.  I'll have to see how easily I can get that into my checking account.

Fairly unutilized, but one does exist.  Minimal activity to keep it open.

I am looking at the card route now, looks to be the best way to keep the kids happy.  That's the ultimate goal, the entire thing be as transparent to them on their day to day life as possible.  Ideally if done right them not know anything was an issue at all.

Agreed.  Although it wasn't always like this, life circumstances can change very quickly.  What has been fine and working for a while and would have continued to work is what I was going by, I failed to factor in the emergency 'someone needs to go to the hospital' or 'someone needs to get bailed out' scenario.  Lesson learned.
