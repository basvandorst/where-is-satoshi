If you have ever used a bit coin ATM you would know why it's a bad idea to put one in an airport. It's a slow process of transferring coins, verifying identities, getting confirmations... You really want someone sitting there for a 30 minute wait just to get to use the machine?

No it just means that the bank was lying about how much money it had.

Well, the example given by the OP is Japanese yen to USD. If you are a money changer (currency exchange) then you must comply with anti money laundering laws. They have to abide by the rules just like Moneygram or Western Union.

really? lets look at your greenlight page. What's the first word after 'the' in the subtitle? and what subreddits are you posting this to?

I don't know if they side with the buyer but when a buyer does a chargeback the bank takes the money from eBay. They have to prove to the bank that the charge was legit. They would rather avoid the cost and sit on their ass and make the seller prove that they are worth the loss. Unless the seller has a high enough volume then they aren't worth it. Simple business logic.

The economy shouldn't be your defining asset. Look at the game tensix.  It had a virtual object ownership system that was unique. However it's not important,  and it was hyped a lot. It didn't matter anyways. Focus on gameplay.

Well, I used a kiosk once. If you are leaving the USA for example, you can pretty much take USD anywhere and exchange them. In Russia there are money changers everywhere some even on the same street so they compete with each other to buy your USD (or EUROs). On the flip side, you'll have to go to your bank to change from RUB to USD. Either that, or just do it in the airport when you arrive. I choose the airport because it's easy. I don't have to go sit in my bank for 30 minutes standing in line, drive there, wake up early because they close at 1pm on Saturdays...
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:07:33
It's pretty much what's required in the USA.

Who says that they thought they had it? Maybe they just fabricated transactions.  Someone orders 100 btc they make a fake account and  in the database that they have 100 for sale at the exact price. It's just plain fraud.

I dunno is an ounce of Bitcoin worth an ounce of gold? It's a dumb measurement. It's an arbitrary amount of gold to an arbitrary measure of Bitcoin to a piece of paper.

Op is not getting the money. Best case, the coins are real and his parents can retire. Worst case, he steals the coins and his parents sue him and gets most of it back.  Mediocre case, wallet is there but coins are spent.

It could be a credit account. The bank puts money in, you have to pay them back for what you use.

Because the dollar doesn't mean anything to Bitcoin. Who cares how many pieces of paper a Bitcoin is worth? It has value without dollars.

I always feel bad for those guys that have a tesla. I always see them when I'm charging my leaf. I was going to complain, but they don't have many places to charge.

Cool, I'd love to pay for megafon in russia with bitcoins. I know you can top it up if you go to one of those machines, but it would be nice to be able to just do that online.

This should be the top comment. If they are hoping for a conviction out of this, they need to turn it over to police, have proper chain of custody.

Small amounts are traceable too. And if it comes to a court of law they can trace every single transaction. You bought $20 worth of weed one time 10 years ago? Yeah that's recorded. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:31:36
It's not though. It's traceable more than cash.

One bitcoin is about equal to one doggy coin?  I'll make you a deal then. I'll sell you two dogecoins for just one bitcoin!

I know. I don't imagine players will like waiting around a vendor for two minutes until their transaction is confirmed.

I appreciate you correcting me. I can do without the attitude.

Which is the bare minimum any company should do. Definitely not worth mentioning.

It's not worth commenting that they did the right thing. It is worth commenting that they did it a whole month late.

There is a transaction like little Timmy buying a coke and then there are blocks like little Timmy's dad buys a case of cokes at Costco. Gavin removed the transaction cache and added a block cache. So it's like going from reading the serial numbers on a can of coke to reading the serial number of the box they came in. If you are counting cokes it's easier to count 12 in a pack than to pull each coke and count each one.

I had a litecoin wallet with a few hundred coins. Hard drive crashed. My fault for not backing up but now I have online wallets.

Perhaps, but suppose they are for a minute, you'd be caught donating money to a terrorist group, which would make you an enemy combatant. Next thing you know, you are drone striked. Is it really worth the risk?

just wanted to say that you don't know who the people are.  could be mafia for all i know. fine of you aren't paying, but soon as you donate one cent you could be breaking the law.

I'd say that's fine if they want to mine the main bitcoin chain, but only if they give me the coins they mined with my hardware.
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:17:58
exactly. like you owned a piece of land and bought a gold mining rig and they deliver it, mine on your land then keep all the gold themselves. if they were up front about it and gave the customers a discount, then there would be no problem. but what they are doing is stealing from customers. they should be using the test chain because that's what it's for. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:35:02
Seems pretty simple to me - if you want to get the most coins, mine with all your asics until the difficulty increase, don't mine the next, so difficulty decreases, repeat.
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:09:26
Actually, when I was manufacturing computers, it was standard to do a one week burn in process. Two weeks doesn't seem like too much for completely new hardware. Still, they should have mined a different chain, not the main.
