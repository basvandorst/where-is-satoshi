Just found out Metacert kind of does that, this is from its telegram bot which we have in a group with some friends:
MetaCert Security Bot:warning: This address 
    1DG8pnwK9vdevHjB1nfDQRUmyYVJyPQNf9
is **unverified**.  
Because this crypto address is unverified, you should proceed with caution before sending money to it.  
If you believe this address should be verified or reported as phishing, please join the MetaCert Slack and send us a message.
