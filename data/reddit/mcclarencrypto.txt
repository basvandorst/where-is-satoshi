So the doomsday scenario would be where the dollar collapses creating so much instability that real estate and other asset classes begin to collapse leaving most people essentially poor and the govt is willing to kill people to gain control back of the money supply.
The idea of them peacefully folding would be where they say "ok, this fiat stuff is inferior to bitcoin. We will back the dollar by bitcoin." Or they become very involved in the mining and development of bitcoin for the greater  good of humanity and bitcoin becomes the national currency.

Really excellently put my friend

There is a cost to hodl fiat but because the us dollar is the international standard the price of goods in the short term are relatively stable. My bank reimburses ATM fees up to $50 every month. And....Well....if bitcoin could be used more like fiat cash it could replace it.

Sounds like your in favor of censorship but the truth remains that cash transactions need to be free or it isn't functioning as cash.

I mean lightning is nice but it is only an attempt by the community to cope. Which is sad. Bitcoin in itself is supposed to work perfectly like cash.

Hmmmm I have been thinking about that (philosophically) for a while, that would be an excellent scaling solution
@_date: 2019-07-08 08:18:17
Can't argue that the logic surrounding my post is much more sound than the logic surrounding your attempt at an insult
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:55:58
Hahah this is exactly what I envision. I'll race you on the moon when we get there.

Dude what an excellent way to put it. Absolutely roasted the non conforming nation states.
@_date: 2019-06-02 01:35:04
That's sick

McAfee? Is that you?
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:34:15
Good for you Tom! You're the man.
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:09:14
That is so fu king true... call it whatever they want depending on whats convenient at the time. Fucking cock suckers. The only other people that are like that are little fucking kids that make up a game that they want to be the winner at. "New rule! New rule!" 
They need to grow the fuck up and get real jobs.
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:41:48
Hahah was thinking this earlier
@_date: 2019-06-30 09:46:59
Dude, holy shit. I just checked to see if it was a glitch or something but it is still showing Jamie dimon as CEO lol wtf???
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:45:08
Be a strong frog
@_date: 2019-02-05 20:58:24
Omfg that was so funny! Lmao
@_date: 2019-04-22 05:35:12
I would never side with those guys lol
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:54:25
That's true man but the lightning network is not that easy to use to be honest.
@_date: 2019-12-25 23:45:47
Shit coins ;)
@_date: 2019-04-07 02:21:27
This is so sick Dude! I want this on a t shirt, a poster, and a bumper sticker 
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:17:38
That would really be pretty sweet. That would definitely solve all these problems.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:07:18
I like to think the time was not wasted lol anyways I was on break at work and had time to burn but I have that app and it's just awkward to need to open a channel with each person you want to do business with.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:54:12
That's amazing
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:45:58
To be honest with you I never actually used it. That was just how I understood it and that's the way it seemed to work on the app. But thanks for clearing that up for me. I will have to give it a full test in the near future.
@_date: 2019-04-22 05:33:45
That's a very good point... this needs more contemplation
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:03:37
Yeah I understand, I had a previous post that said that there should be no fees until the reward reaches zero. Then fees should kick in.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:09:49
Lol I know I am cheap I'm sorry!
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:49:06
Oh yeah that's true. Sure does make it hard to operate as a merchant who accepts bitcoin though that way. Because you have to trust that the coins won't be double spent in order to allow the customer to leave the store in a timely manor.
@_date: 2019-01-08 03:34:44
I should have threw that shit where it belongs. In the trash. 
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:56:04
Wow... that is just the most mathematically incorrect answer you could have possibly given
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:57:22
These are also the people that will run the world's largest corporations and head the world's largest government's making decisions on behalf of investors and tax payers
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:19:30
Incredibly true
