Fair point about the life of the channel. I think he was more aiming the point at how it would be impossible for some guy in sub sahara to make a L1 tx when he will only ever have €10 in his account and the fees will be much higher than that (presuming one crypto rules the world). So though technically L1 is censorship resistant, it is only for people who can afford the fees. Is there enough of a gain here for the entire world to switch to that format? The markets will decide.
But one thing worth noting. In the west we all want everything for free now. Telling someone they will have to pay money to move their paycheck to the LN is a risky move (in the EU bank transfers are free for years now); being paid in the LN itself would just bring back centralisation (you would be paid automatically in the LN to avoid charges, which leads to the catch 22 about whether bitcoin is then censorship resistant for the wealthy only).
Either way compromises have to be made.
In 10 years people will look back on this debate and wonder why it was so bitter and vilen everyone will just shrug their shoulders and be clueless

Coingeek actually calls it bitcoin segwit. Just sayin

It is the real bitcoin tho, every other one is a fork
@_date: 2019-03-10 12:32:14
But you are explicitly contradicting satoshi who said that th majority of nodes would be on farms. He said initially enthusiasts would run the code.
Is it that you think he was wrong.
Btw it is absolute discrimination. They can use bitcoin on a brick phone. Have you ever used it?
Th systen was not designed with 1mb blocks.
Do you know what the block limit was when bitcoin first ran?
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:13:55
Tell me exactly what you did not say? I kept a screenshot of your deleted comment btw 
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:36:35
This is true
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:11:10
What if i live in timbuktw and only have a brick phone? Participation is above my income limit. Do people with a lower standard of living not count as much as others?

So owners of full nodes supercede spv users and miners in deciding what bitcoin is and is not?
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:59:05
The offer always stands. Enjoy your weekend :)
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:30:19
Did you come to that answer by consensus across bitcoin users/miners or by your own opinion?
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:11:47
Is it that your previous comment was so bad it completely contradicted your point?
This is not trolling
I am looking for you to tell me how can you can say the system caters for someone on a brick phone who cannot afford to run a full node yet in the same breath say it don’t care about people who chose not to run a full node.
I mean yo can’t have both.
Which is it?
Someone who spends bitcoin is very much participating in the network. Or do you disagree with that also?
@_date: 2019-03-10 07:13:24
But your point makes no sense. Hw can it be fighting for them if by the rules of the system those very people are not considered the same as those who run a full node? You just said it yourself in this exact thread. It’s an argument that falls apart before you even finish making it
My parents have brick phones, they can afford smart phones but chose not to. Are you going to discriminate against them because one of them doesn’t chose what you deem to be a lower limit asa lifestyle choice? What if they want to wear jeans instead of trousers? Drink coffee instead of tea? Are they less entitled to consideration than someone who runs a full node?
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:07:52
Why delete the comment?
@_date: 2019-03-03 09:30:43
So if it ls less than a dollar a month how long before someone breaks even on the initial investment and actually starts making profit?
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:39:06
Have you ever seen the youtube video of Jack saying how twitter catered for the libertarian briagde to bootstrap the platform and then he starts laughing when he says they don’t give a fuck about that point of view now?
Have a look for it.
Jack is not on the side of the freedom loving libertarian.

@_date: 2019-03-09 17:20:32
If no one is more important than anyone why must you run a full node to have you voice heard? If a guy uses bitcoin 20 times a day on an spv you are saying his point is not worthy, so in fact others are more important than him
@_date: 2019-03-09 12:45:39
Care to explain how that consensus was achieved?
@_date: 2018-10-23 08:24:41
Its really ironic how the crypto space has evolved. All those years ago it started with people saying we can do whatever we want, we will change the world. We don’t need the ruling class, we are looking to dismantle them.
Now all we want is moon and approval from said ruling class
@_date: 2018-10-31 08:13:26
How things have changed since then
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:39:42
Is it because of the comments you deleted? I have screen shots of the whole convo.
It shows how you don’t really have a clue about what you are talking about. You say one thing then a minute later completely contradict your hardened stance. 
That said I wouldn’t worry too much. It is because of the rampant censorship that has been going on. Trust me you are not alone.
Me and plenty others were like you are now.
When you sit and think about it the whole thing is quite contradictory, feel free to send me a pm and we can start all over no hard feelings, it took quite a while for my brain to be un-brainwashed aswell tbh
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:31:42
What an idiot. Says you need to take responsibility to educate yourself then Don’t trust the banks but do trust these people I tell you to smh
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:05:16
So basically there is no profit to be made atm since the initial investment cannot be recouped, or at the very least it would take a loooong time to recoup it
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:16:10
I have read them.
I stand by my statement.
You have clearly stated two contradicting opinions
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:20:03
Actually Eth has far more devs on it. Prob 100x more. If you think that Btc has the best devs you don’t understand the free market

@_date: 2019-02-20 18:25:38
See if he came out and said he loved bitcoin you would have a hard on because there would be a chance you could sell yours at a huge profit.
When he puts doubt into your investment the only thing you can do is come up with some lame reply that doesn’t even refute his claim.

You can bring the horse to the water...
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:45:44
Yeah thats a fair point if you wanna go that way though you better be comfortable with Peter Todd’s past. I hope you hold him to the same standard as Mike Hearn
@_date: 2019-02-03 17:56:07
The links to the nsa. Do a bit of digging and you will see the emails are out there. Funny how he has always refused to answer the question isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-12-28 00:16:43
Its actually quite cheap to send the money to an intermediary bank account in iran who will then exit it through turkey and send it to a german account who will then sepa it to your friends account.
There are plant of rich people in iran who do this far more efficient than bitcoin for quite a small fee. Tell him get someone in iran go into a travel agent they all facilitate these transactions upto ish $100,000. Any higher you pay more for “elite” service

You do realise some of them are Bsv “proponents” right?
@_date: 2019-04-15 17:54:54
They also claimed Adam Back did not have Bitcoins best interests at heart. Ye all pretended not to hear that one though eh

Never said it was written by Assange. Unless you can point me to that.
Was written just after BS started, and Andreessen still had keys to the repo.
Have a read of the entire section there see some of the other releases and see what is said.
If you think that email is not a cause fo serious alarm then loom for John Dillon’s correspondences with Peter Todd.
The evidence is all out there.

Boom. That was when I opened my eyes a few years ago. Have a look at the other sub and you will see different topics all together

But when the second layer which is going to be used by everyone is choked by a few central players which provide liquidity it will become censorable. But hey, lambo moon is better

Jihan translated the whitepaper to Chinese, was first person to do so. He has been around all bubbles, bitmain has been around since 2013, more likely before but was confirmed as around then

Am...they are. They are saying the exact same thing as Ver, the only difference is what they wish to displace. One wants to displace another crypto, the others want to displace fiat
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:17:52
Ah ok. I see your point, I think. Correct me if I am taking you up wrong here (I may be) you do not have a problem with bitcoin as a crypto having a ceo, your problem is that (you believe)  Roger, being the ceo of bitcoin.com,  is trying to trick people who know nothing about the two coins into buying bch instead of btc? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:14:10
No, they claim they want to displace fiat
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:11:49
Ah ok. So then you have no issue if Christine Lagarde called Mow the Bitcoin Ceo...you know so you can remain consistent
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:05:20
 We can deal with each one of your points at a time to debunk them all clearly.
Lets start with your one ‘its also been proven to a degree....’
So when Armin Van Bitcoin says Btc will collapse governments does that make him the Btc ceo by same standard you judge Roger by? Or Samson Mow saying Btc is “not for people who earn $2 a day”....is he the Btc ceo?
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:10:24
Ok, I think I am beginning to see where you are coming from. But tbh it makes no sense to me. Maybe you can clear something up for me.
What do you think Roger should do with bitcoin.com
(A) continue the site as is, just insist in the future nobody or news program etc mentions he is ceo of the website. He also never says he is ceo of the website
(B) Take down the site completely so nobody else can ever use it, and it will forever show a blank page
(C) Hand control of the site over to someone who “represents” Btc, eg LukeJr, Samson Mow, Armin VanBitcoin etc
(D)If there is something else you wish to say or that you think should happen please let me know. I understand you are upset at this, I am just trying to figure out exactly what it is exactly that upsets you, because I cannot see any reason
@_date: 2018-04-27 00:35:40
But you didn’t answer my question. Its quite telling that you didn’t
You see, from my point of view I cannot understand your position.
You say no coin should have a Ceo, implying that you advocate a permission less system.
But then you say that Roger should or shouldn’t do something, meaning you think that there should be some degree of permission. 
I mean, you can’t have it both ways.
It is a trait I see quite often in this sub and shows how little people here actually believe in a permission less system. I think they believe more in getting rich and are afraid about bch takin value from their investment. 
I mean if you don’t like him, fair enough. Shout it out all you want. But you can’t advocate for a permission less system and then look for the rule book when something you deem unfair happens.
Just my two satoshis. 
Anyway no hard feelings
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:14:10
When did he say he was a Ceo of any cryptocurrency or wanted Btc or Bch to have one?
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:52:54
He has never used the Ceo label to mislead people. He says he is the Ceo of the website, you think he should not as people who dont know anything would presume he owns all of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:29:51
I’m not the one whining and looking for the feds to get involved here, thanks for the suggestion though :)
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:38:02
Well that’s a fair and reasonable thing to do. But just exactlywhat misunderstanding did I spread?
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:08:16
The end of what?
@_date: 2019-05-04 06:50:18
Utility; the state of being useful, profitable or beneficial
The majority of places you send bitcoin (which is a tiny fraction of places that accept either cash or cards) you have to search out for.
Bitcoin has zero to no utility
To spend bitcoin you had to send money to and exchange (which possibly cost you), exchange with fiat which incurred a fee, withdrew from exchange which incurred both a withdrawal fee and a tx fee, then send to the merchant which also incurred a fee. Using LN on top of that also had an extra transaction
I just want to clear up people who are spreading misunderstandings about
@_date: 2019-05-02 13:22:41
