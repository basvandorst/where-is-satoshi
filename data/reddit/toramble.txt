In the 80s A&amp;W stopped selling a 1/3 pound burger for precisely this reason: over half the participants in their market studies [thought 1/3 was getting less compared to 1/4](

To reiterate, this meme casts the roles incorrectly. 
If you apply the logic of this meme, it suggests that governments (Gandalf) are going to save the financial system (Rohan) by regulating (lifting the spell). And further that Bitcoin (Theoden) has been secretly controlled by a dark power all along (um, CIA?? Winklevii?). If that's the point, then I think OP is mistaken.
Bitcoin ought to be cast on the *other* side of the analogy. That is to say, Theoden/Saruman should be the regulators, claiming that Bitcoin 'has no power' as a currency. And then being proved wrong.

What I find amusing is that the leaked ['crisis strategy' document]( calls for exactly that, a bailout 'because this isn't about saving Mt. Gox anymore'. (read p2 &amp; 3) Lol. 
Granted its author(s) are drafting it with Mt.Gox interests in mind, but it would be a farce if this actually happened.

This is an interesting point I had not considered in my flippant comment. Thanks for the elucidation.

A slight problem with this meme/analogy is that directly after this scene, Tarkin blows Alderaan to smithereens.
Kind of implies that things are going to get rather rocky for cryptocurrencies in the near future.

An amusing speculation is, considering no one seems to know who they are, is if you substituted the term 'law enforcement' with 'state actor' in your above comment, and then took the idea one step further -- that an agency of some government somewhere *already did* take an interest, and is behind ghashio.
That is to say, a government is in the process of attempting to not-so-subtly take control of bitcoin (masquerading as an independent party) as an instrument in their battle kit for global financial warfare. You nurture the system till it grows big enough, and then boom, one day you control the transactions for a very interesting subset of people around the globe...

that's ... very clever wordplay.

Are you actually implying that governments *are* about to regulate? Because in [that scene]( Theoden (under Saruman's spell) declares 'You have no power here, Gandalf the Grey', and then immediately thereafter, Gandalf lifts the spell and shows that he does indeed have the power.
This meme image is not a good choice if you are trying to evangelize; you have the roles mixed up.
