I've looked into this a lot.  Specific trading ideas almost never had concrete logic backing it up.  "Well if the curves start to get close then a break out is going to happen soon."  A price move was inevitable anyway so this was pretty much a meaningless thing to say.  "Well when the curves look like an N that means the price is probably going to X."  Where X is different for all of the rain makers making claims.
I looked into trading futures for a few months quite seriously.  Really there wasn't good logic in most of what I read.
There are some traders that do well in other ways - for example, figuring out when an automated system, big player is making a move and exploiting a mistake or riding the wave.  Or from insider trading.  But really very few traders are doing any meaningful analysis.  The few traders I respect are often only making a couple trades a month.  And the amount of variance involved with so few trades is just sick.  Someone that smart could probably be making more money doing something else and with less stress... and actually be helping the world in some way.  But very few traders fall into the group that actually has an edge, especially after fees... just so that is clear.
I'd be interested to know where you think your edge comes from in bitcoin trading.
BTW all of this comes from a professional poker player so I am not some risk averse person that thinks people can't have an edge in gambling games.  I just don't think most of the people doing trading really have an edge at all - and even in the few cases they do I really question is all the research and preparation is worth a couple small edges a month... at least if you're not extremely rich.

Whenever I use my credit card for an online purchase it is remarkably easy and takes less than 30 seconds.  This is definitely not some sticking point of credit cards that consumers actually care about.  In fact, people rather like their credit cards for the most part and for general purchases there isn't a tangible difference between the two (at best, I'd still argue that learning a whole new system makes it less efficient for sure).  This also ignores plenty of very nice benefits of credit cards... such as fraud/theft protection and building a credit score.

Well that is just not reality.  Not sure how to put it nicely but when you write this it makes you seem completely clueless.  You don't want to save %s on all of your debts in life - like if you want to be a home owner or decide to buy a new car on credit later on?  How are extra options not at least a somewhat positive?

It seems like you are strongly in denial here.  I hope you aren't putting a  significant amount of money for you into bitcoin.  This is *extremely* risky and you are not some hero for doing this.  Just seems like plain greed to me.

With a credit card you get 1% oftentimes and you don't have to constantly buy gift cards to make all of your purchases.  Besides big purchases I know I wouldn't give a damn about 2% if it meant I was going to waste my time dealing with that crap.

The users are driving the real "adoption" outsides of exchanges.  I am only willing to invest in a bitcoin shop because I think people will actually use their bitcoins there.  As a business operator and user I actually think the people trading are detracting from its adoption due to massive price swings.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:12:01
Buying a house is cheaper than renting if you are going to stay in the same place for a long time, depending on the location.  This is true even with the interest expense.  Thus, it is a financially sound decision to buy if you know you will stay put.  If you have bad credit you might end up paying a couple percent more which ends up being big money!
A person can be in debt and still have a positive net worth, and be making a good financial decision.  As for a new car - yeah that isn't a good decision from purely a money standpoint.  But neither is buying almost anything.  You might not want a new car now as a luxury but in 10 years who knows!
You also seem caught up having an asset that doesn't depreciate like the dollar.  Well guess what?  Holding your money in bitcoins isn't earning anything in the long run, it'll just keep up with inflation.  If you invest your money into something instead - say, the stock market - you'll do better than bitcoin in the long run.  And heck, as a store of value bitcoin isn't some established long term standard.  At the moment it is extremely risky.

You think the price of that commodity is going to randomly be stuck to bitcoin?  You are cray.
@_date: 2015-01-30 00:18:44
Let's look at a real world example.  There is this site that tracks poker results on big poker websites.  For quite a while they only accepted bitcoin - although later on they started accepting other methods like paypal.  During the time they only accepted bitcoin the price was still pegged to dollars.  You were expected to send him 50 dollars a month worth of bitcoins for his service.
Price stability needs to come first before people will actually be willing to offer a good/service in a set price of BTC.  Rational people are simply unwilling to have their earnings fluctuate so wildly for no reason.  And on the other side, it is unreasonable that the price of a product shoots up a ton arbitrarily.  That service is fairly priced at 50 dollars a month.  If bitcoin were to go up 5x in price (which it actually did) it is pretty damn unreasonable to suddenly think his product is worth 250 a month.
Beyond that I'd suggest taking a course in international trade/finance.  It'll teach you a lot about how exchange rates aren't simply "numbers on a screen" that don't matter.  Indeed when one currency weakens/strengthens relative to another there are serious implications.  In your example where everyone accepts bitcoin (a one world currency) this might not be true, but that just isn't true.
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:59:15
Wasn't bitcoin essentially "premined" where some people got a ton of coins before anyone else was actually mining them?

That is sure going to get the masses behind adopting bitcoin.
Also I bet this would still be illegal in plenty of places, if it is in bitcoin or not.  There are plenty of ponzi schemes in dollars as well... the law doesn't seem to hold them back, either.

A portion doesn't solve the problem.  If they can't pay their rent and other bills, if they can't buy their food and if they can't pay their taxes with bitcoin the primary problem still remains.

You are talking about this like bitcoin doesn't have its own security pitfalls for individuals.  Considering the large number of reported scams/lost coins/theft of physical wallets/hacks on this forum I am really not sure why you're trying to portray the situation as something better than it is.
Take what you said and turn it on its head for a moment.  Bitstamp is a large company no doubt with security professionals helping guard their money.  Even still they fell prey to an attack.  An individual would likely be easier prey in most (not all) cases.

Even the world's most unstable currencies are really stable compared to bitcoin.
You didn't find a detour around the last mile until people can actually pay their large expenses with bitcoin, on a large scale.  And that definitely won't change at least until the above point is remedied, and even then it'll have many hurdles to overcome.

This is a big if that you're glossing over.  This is exactly why these protections are in place.  If a random guy from Nigeria gets access to your bitcoin wallet then you are screwed out of however much money is in there.  If the same guy gets access to your debit card information there is a good chance he'll be found out before he can take any of the money.  And because protections like these work reasonably well, banks can actually afford to reimburse lost funds even in the event that a thief gets away with your money.
And this is a *bad* thing?  All because of an inconvenient 20 minute phone call that occurs are few times in a person's life?  I'd trade in that hour of my time and be protected, personally, and I think most people (outside of the bitcoin world) would as well.
@_date: 2015-01-31 02:45:51
I failed to make you understand so I'll try another example.
You're a farmer and you have to buy a new tractor.  You want to buy one that is reasonable quality and for the lowest price that meets your standards.  This is just rational behavior.
Let's think of two scenarios.  The first bitcoin is worth $10,000 each and the second bitcoin is worth $50 each.  The tractor manufacturer in your bitcoin community charges 5 bitcoins.  A tractor in the neighboring city costs $2,000.
In the case where bitcoin is worth $10,000 you'd be paying $50,000 for that tractor.  Here you would obviously want to go to the neighboring city and buy the tractor in dollars.  You could sell .2 of a bitcoin to accomplish this.  This ends up costing you .2 bitcoins instead of 5.  Why would you actually buy the tractor for 5 bitcoins?
In the case where bitcoin is worth $50 it'd cost $250.  Here you would obviously want to buy from the bitcoin community.  However, now looking at the problem from the sellers perspective, he wouldn't be willing to sell it to you since he would only be getting 5 bitcoins.  If he instead sold it to the neighboring city for $2,000 he could buy instead 40 bitcoin with that money.
Does this example explain better why rational actors force the price to an equilibrium point?
@_date: 2015-01-19 11:46:25
Yeah except hundreds of people aren't writing tips.  Most people that gets bit coin tips are probably getting less than 2 dollars total lifetime.

Think about imports and exports.  I live in bitcoinville where people all use bitcoin to conduct business.  I am a farmer and produce wheat.  I can sell that wheat to anyone.  If the price of bitcoin were to go down a lot, I would no longer be wlling to sell it to people in bitcoinville since someone in the neighboring city is willing to pay more.  Conversely, if the price of bitcoin were to go up a lot then a citizen of bitcoinville would no longer be in interested in buying my expensive wheat - he could just buy it for a cheaper price from someone outside of this bubble.  This applies to every good you can think of.
What about services?  If the price of bitcoin went to such a high level where a waiter was earning 200 dollars an hour, people would flood into bitcoinville and demand jobs - to a lower pay level until it reached sanity.  Look at it from the consumer's side, too.  Nobody is going to randomly be happy paying 5 times the price for a burger just because the value of their bitcoins rose.
And so on.  Reality is that you cant simplify economics.  There has to be a balance and bitcoin doesn't change the realities of the world.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:29:10
Yes and despite the result the FedEx guy was being an idiot.  And sure, if that was his *only* way to keep the company then maybe it was actually a good risk to take, despite being a bit -ev.

@_date: 2015-01-19 10:27:38


Both of these points are backwards.
The cost of producing a bill is 4 cents, so on average the overall % is very small, even if the average bill was a 5 then it'd cost less than 1%.
Meanwhile there are about 3.6k bitcoins produced daily.  Their value is about 750k and the cost to mine them is only a bit less than that.  The % is huge.
This doesn't tell nearly the complete picture, but for the specific thing you're talking about you have it completely backwards.
@_date: 2015-01-18 09:13:52

No and the bitcoin community doesn't seem to understand how to properly tip someone.  Either you give an amount that people will actually appreciate... otherwise you're likely giving them an amount that is just insulting.
Edit: It'd be like going to a restaurant and leaving the tip line blank versus actually taking the time to write in 20 cents.
@_date: 2015-01-17 06:34:07
These kinds of price fluctuations are completely standard for bitcoin.  While this is slightly worse than average in the past, realize that bitcoin is extremely risky.

I am unwilling to take street amphetamine because in numerous studies I have read it can easily be neurotoxic.  The money is not significant to me and I'd rather just pay for a pure product.
What is truly crazy to me is that more people aren't beginning to sell adderall.  I know when I was a broke college student I'd have jumped on the prospect of making a grand a month without having to put in any hours.

Stock is not "a little prestige in their name".  It represents a % ownership of the company.  Someone that owns the company is not the slave... they are the king.
This ownership in the company provides a return on a person's investment that exceeds inflation on average by a fair bit.  When holding a commodity - be in gold or bitcoin - all you're really hoping to do is deflect inflation.  That makes it so your assets never appreciate in value in the long run and you end up having to work fully for everything in your life (instead of making your assets work for you).

Using a dark net market even if you know you're going to be scammed sometimes is not stupid by itself.  It is just a hidden cost of doing business.

This was pretty clear to the evil buttcoiners without hindsight needed.  It was just pure mania.  Even today bitcoin is not actually doing anything to improve an ordinary person's life and the elevated price is still just a result of people buying for the sake of hodling.  That all might change some day and who knows, maybe bitcoin or another like it will change the world.

It is an internet wallet that you can easily transfer money around with.  I know it because I am an internet poker player.  This (and neteller) are what poker players use to move around large amounts of money fast/easy.  And yeah, you can send 50k at a time.  It is extremely convenient and easy to use.  You can even get a debit card associated with a skrill account which can be used to buy stuff on a lot more sites than just a select few like overstock.
Why not actually look at other services that exist which use actual money before you assume that nothing else can "touch the convenience" that bitcoin provides.  This service already provides exactly what you're claiming is unique to bitcoin in the example you've brought up.  Only I'd much prefer skrill in this case because it doesn't have the unpredictable value fluctuations and with more options of where to ultimately spend your actual money.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:17:00
These negative stories are numerous.  The positive ones are a complete joke and anyone with half a brain realizes that bitcoin isn't actually improving anyone's life today.  It definitely might in the future and I am not a 100% bitcoin hater.  It is just pretty clear the pro bitcoin crowd is so delusional.
If you want to have a website dedicated to the human element of something then that something should actually be a positive force in people's lives.  Bitcoin is not that.  It is only actually useful for gambling and drugs.  That is seriously it.
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:31:02
Would you be willing to accept people with negative stories?  For example, the wife that posted on reddit recently who said her marriage/life is being ruined because her husband became addicted to gambling on bitcon.  Or what about the story of the folks that went deep into debt to fund their bitcoin gambling addiction?  What about some positive testimony of someone being able to easily buy heroin online?  Put some stories up from the people that had money on Gox when it went bankrupt.  And so on.

This is a thread about bitcoin from the average person's perspective.  You've made a decent argument for why a merchant would want to use bitcoin and I am not disagreeing with most of the points you bought up.
However, none of the points you've brought up refute the topic brought up by pizza_power.  As of today, there isn't a reason for the average person to use bitcoin.  I've pointed out a couple of big drawbacks that the average consumer faces and they are real issues.  Right now using bitcoin mostly comes at a price premium over traditional methods of payment and price fluctuations do in fact matter on the consumer's side if there is a delay in purchasing bitcoin.  That needs to change if bitcoin is to be adopted by the masses.
@_date: 2015-03-12 04:45:31
You should feel like a complete idiot for recommending bitcoin at all for a real world business today.  Maybe in the future it'll change but all variables point towards this being almost entirely fruitless for a business no matter what angle you're looking at it from.  There isn't any advantage bitcoin provides over the normal avenues and if you think it actually does you've drank the Koolaid.

Go to the bathroom and look in the mirror.  Now say this aloud.  "I tipped someone 10 cents."  It might help to actually say this in person and look at yourself as you say it to get an honest perspective of if you truly think this is reasonable behavior or not.
BTW receiving even a few dollars total lifetime (the upper limit of what most people might receive) in these micro tips is not giving anyone value.  The time spent to figure out how to actually get the money out of the account is probably not worth it for a dollar.  And yes, many people believe that if you are unwilling to give a decent tip then it is best to not tip at all.  It is just insulting.
Finally, it is great that people are "exploring" the idea of a micro tip.  However, part of that "exploration" is getting feedback to see if it works or not.  When people often shun someone for tipping 10 cents it might suggest that the exploration failed.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:45:16
If you can figure out how to make a market where the funds are safe for users and dealers while in escrow, then do it.  Right now there isn't such an option.  Evo was the best option for people who wanted to buy/sell drugs online.  Even knowing that a market will steal your money once per year on average it can *very easily* be a rational choice to still use their service.  You just factor that in as a hidden fee.
I'll give you my situation and you can decide if I am some clueless idiot after reading it.  I like to use adderall for work and it very obviously increases my earnings substantially - netting me at least another $5,000 a month.  I have ordered this for a couple of years now without being a victim to a market going down.  I always do larger orders and my last one was for $1,200 worth - a 3 month supply.  That decision in my estimation is earning me 15,000 - 1,200 = 13,800.  Evolution ended up stealing this money instead and I will not receive the drugs.  I figure that that will happen about 5-10% of the time based on the time it takes to receive an order.  So 5-10% of the time I lose $1,200 and 90-95% of the time I earn $13,800.  Is this still an irrational decision to you?  Is there a better way of getting this drug (it isn't available in the country I live in)?
BTW thanks for wishing I'd die of an overdose.  Pretty reasonable of you.

I read and understood what you wrote.  However, you are pretty much just ignoring the implications of a currency price change in your post.  To you is there *any* difference in the economy of bitcoinville when the price of bitcoin drops/inreases by a factor of 5?
My post isn't incoherent at all.  A 15 year old in high school economics would be able to understand what I just wrote.  The fact that you don't understand it doesn't mean you should be implying that other people are stupid.  It is indeed you who are woefully stupid on the topic of economics.  And I actually doubt you couldn't comprehend what I wrote.  There is probably some mental block from all of the bitcoin kool-aid you have been drinking that turns off your ability for basic reasoning.  What I explained is so profoundly simple that really a person should get it after reading that concise explanation.
For some odds reason you don't seem to understand that the price change of a local currency in fact does have an impact on the population using that currency.  You can chance the variables to look at the price of dollars changing if you want too but the same idea will hold.

That just strengthens the idea that people will use actual money because it is currently cheaper to use than bitcoin.  As a regular Joe I wanted to buy something with bitcoin the other day.  I looked through a bunch of the different options available to me and ended up losing 1% right away when I bought them.  If I could have just bought this with dirty fiat money I would have because I wouldn't have randomly lost 1%.  Nevermind the hassle involved and ridiculous currency exchange rate risk - I don't even know if my coins will be worth enough to buy my product because of a 5 day delay.  Great job, bitcoin!
Bitcoin's only upside is that it enables people to do shady business dealings on the internet.  If I wasn't buying drugs there would be no reason to use them.

Because this describes almost all of what goes on in the construction of the term human trafficking.  People make insane claims that cause a shock to a lot of people, who never question it.  They take it as a given.  When the rare person comes around and asks for some kind of supporting evidence there is almost never any.  And here you won't even try to provide any.  If you aren't willing to then don't get upset when people call you out for being a likely liar or manipulator.

Sorry about your family's shit experience.  I know that in NK things are really bad for this.  Yeah I can be a prick on this issue.  That is because 99% of the time when someone brings it up they are talking about completely voluntary decisions as "slavery".
I've seen organizations making vague claims ruin a lot of lives.  This includes one case in particular where a man successfully had several children taken away from their families in Thailand.  Turns out he made everything up but what a traumatic experience for those families.  That is why I am *really* sick of seeing unsubstantiated claims when most of them are just completely full of it.  Yours are not so I am sorry.
BTW I don't work with victims of slavery, I am just in the environment it supposedly goes on.  I've found that most of the "victims" of human trafficking are really just trying to build a better life for themselves and and to be left alone.
I help sex workers by finding them access to cheap/free medical tests, condoms and medications.  I just want them to be safer when they are doing their jobs.  I agree I'm not suited to the job of councelling.

I don't understand how it *isn't* a solid argument.  Gold has reliably been worth something for a *long* time and almost certainly won't lose the majority of its value in the next 100 years.  On the other hand bitcoin is extremely uncertain and loses 50% of its value week by week.  It might be worth nothing or close to it in 5 years time.  The other day when it hit down to almost 500 you weren't honestly thinking, "hmmm this might not go so well"?  A level headed person would think it might fall apart - even if they're damn optimistic and think its still a profitable thing to buy and hold.  There is just some decent % of failure in the near future.

Well he is pointing out that the data from an exchange is showing us that most transactions aren't for a "real" transaction.  That is, one that actually involves the exchange of a good/service.  Based on this they are not actually useful.  At least not yet, which is the rebuttal.

They generate *profits* which is what investors seek.  Customers come in and pay a big fee to get convenient access to money.  That big fee essentially goes to the person with shares.  Bit coin does not have profit in this manner, just capital gains.  Another facet of why this is an investment is that barring some kind of legal trouble (or other big catastrophe) you're not going to lose half your investment overnight with this company.  Bit coin might be the next big thing and really blow up, who knows.  But fact remains that you can't confidently say you won't lose a huge % tomorrow.
And technically speculating is investing.  So if you really want to lawyer it, great, you win.  But that is just being pretty ridiculous.  I'm trying to use more precise terms to explain what is really going on.  Investors/traders/etc like to differentiate between the two - and for good reason.  Investing a large % of your net worth is a good idea.  Speculating a large % of your net worth is a terrible idea.

Investopedia explains 'Investment'
The building of a factory used to produce goods and the investment one makes by going to college or university are both examples of investments in the economic sense. 
In the financial sense investments include the purchase of bonds, stocks or real estate property. 
Be sure not to get 'making an investment' and 'speculating' confused. Investing usually involves the creation of wealth whereas speculating is often a zero-sum game; wealth is not created. Although speculators are often making informed decisions, speculation cannot usually be categorized as traditional investing.
And speculation:

Yeah but it gives your statement no substance at all.  With that logic people ought to be able to make up any shit they want and never be questioned.


Nice random personal jab.  But way to be completely wrong.  I live in Thailand where I've spent time actively helping sex workers.  One of their biggest fears are NGOs that are out to "save" them.  They're afraid these people will shut down their place of business (which is not really warranted, it is the police that do this until they get bribes) or actively try to get them deported back home where they and their family are in serious poverty (a real concern).
Meanwhile most of the people I've met doing the saving are religious crazies or profiteering scare mongers.  I wonder which group you fall into, or if you're just a random jackass making shit up.  Given that you're not willing to give any details my guess is the making shit up camp.

I have plenty of empathy for people.  I just really hate folks that don't go around spreading lies and misinformation, especially on this subjet.  AKA: people like you.
BTW the reason for my particular hatred of people like you is that there is SO MUCH misinformation about human trafficking out there.  It has reached a point where most people are being defrauded out of donated funds to help this mostly fake problem.  And the people actually making a real "job" of it, a very small % of the organizations, are actively hurting these people most of the time.  They do it for no reason other than righteousness.  When the "victim" Romanian girl from the UK back home she is not better off for it - now she is likely in debt and doesn't have a means to earn the money.

There are some banks that are basically relying on making interest off the money you keep with them.  That is how they are making their money.  People don't earn interest with bit coins - at least not yet - so that isn't really a strength against some banks (definitely some banks do rape you on hidden fees, though).

I know a lot on this subject because I've used with a forfeitures lawyer for a similar issue.  Legally the money was in Silk Road owner's possession and does not belong to individual users.  It is actually classified as a *loan* from the people with money on the site who are classified as *unsecured creditors*.  Because the government can clearly link these funds to Silk Road they have a strong case to keep the money.  Once you boil it all down you basically don't have a legal basis for making claim on that money.  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  And I do want to say that personally I think that this is completely unfair and ridiculous.  But you're really just going to waste a lot of time and effort trying to pursue that money.

This same idea holds true with money that people spend already.  Instead of spending it on a 5 dollar coffee every morning they could put it in the S&amp;P500 and earn 5% a year after inflation.  Assuming bit coin cannot be invested (which will be true unless something drastic changes) then it likely will generate a worse return than stocks will.    Without being able to invest in it this does not actually offer a return: just works as a store of value that is far inferior to a lot of other investment opportunities.
The same thing is true of gold which holds many of the same properties as bitcoin (especially because most trading of it isn't physical, either).
Notice the value in real dollars.
BTW I think bitcoin will fail for other reasons.  But this argument that my fellow economists give is a really weak one.

A person can basically maintain the value of their money in a basic savings account against inflation.  And there isn't an actual charge *in some banks*.  Thus, holding money in a bank is basically a free way to do most transactions, much like holding bit coins in a wallet is basically free.


Bitcoin is not an investment but you're sure making it sound like one.


Many people can easily end up caught with their pants down in the end.  Thus, using this as a point is very weak because it doesn't look at the whole picture.  Would be akin to me coming around about talk about some stock that in the last few years did exceptionally well and using hindsight to say, "See the return on this trumps banks, period."
