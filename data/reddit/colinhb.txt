Check out this sub. Sort by top from past week.

Agree, either 0.02 mBTC or 20 μBTC is easy.

When I bought the payment stage / invoice was in mBTC. With shipping it was around 1.5 mBTC. 
Agree they should display mBTC in the store alone or with USD, but their backend is probably doing conversions USD -&gt; BTC at the time of payment and integrating that into the store may not be worth it for them.

Think there is something to that analogy, but in context of this discussion not sure I understand, since 1 RMB = 1 yuan.
@_date: 2019-03-06 21:26:53
Think bucks, dimes, and pennies in US dollars are closer analogs, and believe yuan notes are “1 renminbi”, but my memory may be off. Interesting take in any case.

Thanks! Also agree that sat isn’t a very useful at current price.

Understand that perspective, which is why it’s part of my post, but think adding satoshis as a pricing unit creates confusion because (as discussed elsewhere) for anything above a micro-transaction you still need to prefix. So you have too competing bases (one with no mindshare) that have un-aligned prefixes. Since you need prefixing anyway, why create that confusion?
One way the analogy to cents breaks down for me is the number of significant figures. For something that’s €5.30, five euros and 30 cents makes sense to a human. You’re using both units at once. For something that is 5.3 BTC, no one would say five bitcoins and three million satoshis. They don’t co-exist as units.

Understand that reaction. It was more of an olive branch to those who believe we need some new “unit”. (In this case sats.) 
I don’t think there is a need, and I think there are problems with promoting a new denomination. That’s the thrust of my post. 
But for the sake of argument, I’m fine with imaging a world where a new “base” denomination is more apparent. In that case, I think the new denomination should just be “Bitcoin” with conventions for describing what that “Bitcoin” means, since Bitcoins as 10000000 sats is just a convention now (it’s all integers).
I probably should have written the clause you quoted this way (replacing “as” with “under the assumption that”):


How formal that re-denomination would be I don’t really care. I just understand that many people expect to be able to buy pizza with Bitcoin and not have a bunch of leading or trailing zeros.

Why sats instead of milli-, micro-, and nano-bitcoins, the first two of which are already widely used?
@_date: 2019-03-06 18:52:40
I have a lightning node and have bought things with lightning. My point was that things I’ve bought are priced in mBTC (or fiat converted into mBTC) and the invoice format for lightning is Bitcoins (the “amount” field of a lightning invoice) because that’s what humans (vs software) use, not satoshis or MSATs.
For latter, see e.g. here: 
If your argument is that sats are more common for real-world (“actual”) lightning transactions between humans (vs theoretical adoption for micro transactions), I’d be very interested in the evidence because it would be a part of the ecosystem I don’t participate in. As said above the most popular vendors and wallets I know of default to mBTC for display and pricing.

Confused by this, because agree that SI prefixing is what works, but think SI prefixing with Bitcoin is what has actually happened. I've paid plenty of mBTC invoices, but I've never a never seen anyone discuss Megasatoshis, and thrust of my post is there isn't a need for satoshis in major part because of the effectiveness of SI prefixes.
@_date: 2019-03-06 22:08:46
Totally understand that, but don’t think it justifies rebasing on satoshis. In US dollars, you can say a grand, a c-note, a 10-spot, fiver, buck, quarter (from quarter-dollar), etc., and that inventiveness can exist without rebasing. A micro-bitcoin = bit being the most salient example.
@_date: 2019-03-06 12:57:27
Pretty much agree with you. I’m just more sympathetic to arguments on the other side (price of pizza should be a small integer), and my original post reflects that. 
In a world of high adoption and stable prices, I just think that the small integer should be “Bitcoin”, whether:
- it is advertised explicitly prefixed (m₿, your point about the metric system), 
- understood by context or convention to mean what we call m₿, or 
- (most extreme) there has been some more formal re-denomination that all wallets, merchants, payment processors, exchanges, etc., observe. 
This last scenario may not bother me as much as others because I view current Bitcoin definition (10^8 coins) as a display convention. There would just be a new convention.
My personal preference (disregarding needs of other actors) would be just pure metric prefixes.

I hear you on unfamiliarity of micro-, but you could say the same thing about most SI prefixes in America. Hard drive sizes taught the general public the SI system. Most people probably know tera now, but not peta. A few years ago you could have said the same about giga- and tera-.
As for abbreviation, “u” is a pretty common alternative, as is “mc” in the medical field (e.g. mcg = micrograms.)
On SI vs imperial units, as someone who lives in Europe, but grew up in America, people seem to get on fine using ml and not oz. ;)

Lightning's internal representation is millisatoshis / MSATs, but its invoicing format (as set in BOLTs) is whole / tonal Bitcoin with prefixes permitted down to pico-. 
Also, as far as I know, the major clients default display mBTC, and the popular lightning stores (like Blockstream and Starblocks from the old days) invoice in mBTC.
@_date: 2019-03-06 14:15:04
Totally agree that's easier in many situations and understand that point. Hope overall my post and comments reflect that. To your specific example: 0.00052 BTC is also 520 μBTC (micro-BTC often called bits). That has the advantage you highlight (smaller integer) but avoids introducing a new base (satoshis) that still requires a prefix (in this case kilo-). I think μBTC / bits have higher recognition and adoption than kilo-satoshis. This is the "just use metric" approach in some of the comments.

For software not humans. US currency is denominated to milles (1/1000 dollar) under the law but humans don’t work in milles. The fact that internal representation for bitcoin is satoshis (actually “coins”) and lightning is MSATs doesn’t mean humans need to use them.

Poolin was started by the same guys who started BTC.com, but they started it after they left Bitmain. (In fact, Bitmain sued them over starting a competing pool.)
