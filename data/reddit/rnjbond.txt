You're right, one of the most successful investors ever is "too lazy" to understand Bitcoin, but you're clearly smarter and harder working than Warren Buffett

That is amazing! No way could you have ever done that with existing technologies, like paypal!

I get where you're coming from. I don't agree, but it's an interesting thought.

Just because you'd be willing to lose your entire investment doesn't mean you shouldn't cut your losses if you don't see a good future ahead for that investment.

I'm curious, what countries in Africa would you consider to be first world (meaning developed, in this context)? South Africa has the highest GDP, but is definitely developing. Maybe Mauritius, which has the one of the highest GDP per capita in Africa, but even that may be a stretch...

Interesting - I don't think I've ever heard anyone refer to Libya as a developed country outside of the context of it being one of the more developed countries in Africa.

Botswana is no doubt a remarkable success story, especially for a landlocked country.
I suppose our disagreement comes from there not being an official list of developed/first world countries. 
I've been looking at the World Bank's list of High Income Economies ( and the IMF's Advanced Economies List ( That's what's led me to the conclusion that there are no "first world" countries in Africa.

Very aware, thank you. That's why I specifically defined first world as developed in my post. 
Third world has been used as a term for developing economies for a very long time now, far before those "Internet memesters". And it's really not a derogatory term.
