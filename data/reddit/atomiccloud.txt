Thanks for the reply! How quick does the money go through? Is there no way to transfer money electronically to bitfloor instead of having to make a bank deposit?

I've read some posts with localtill being backed up and taking a while to process requests. Hmm... Still might try it.

Then I guess it was mislabeled or something in my wallet. Hmmm....thanks for the info

This sounds like a good option. I too have Wellsfargo. Will look into this when I get home. Thanks!

I have used him two or three times. We both have Wells Fargo bank account so I just did a direct transfer. 
He is fast, friendly and reliable. And no I do not know him personally. Here is a post I made 3 months ago:  where his site was recommended to me from another redditor.

Yes I recognize the twitter name. I have bought stuff from him on bitcointalk!

What a dick.

This would be awesome if they were anywhere close to me. Hopefully more food companies will start accepting BTC. Just a matter of time I suppose...

It must of been mislabeled in my address book then. The money is not in my coinbase account. I just don't know why that address was saved in my wallet under coinbase

I sent a email to him stating that I would buy one immediately when it is released if he accepts BTC
