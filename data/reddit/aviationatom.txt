Not to attempt to down play what happened to you, but as others mentioned, in the grand scheme of things your loss was a drop in the bucket in comparison to major crypto crimes. It will probably be difficult to get any form of redress. Unfortunately law enforcement still faces a learning curve on how to approach these crimes, but truth be told they fail to act on all but the worst of financial crimes. My grandfather just got taken for $8K from the "grandchild in jail" phone  scam and law enforcement basically said "Sorry, not much we can do for you". What you might be able to do though is ping the folks at Chainanalysis and see if they'll take pity on you. This highlights the need for a "crypto blacklist" of sorts, where you sign a message with your private key stating that it has been ocnpromised and then all exchanges volunteer to blackball any outputs that originated from that address.

I've got a direct link to Satoshi. He had an affair with my mother once and we became best buds.
