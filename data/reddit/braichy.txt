Attack on bitcoin was great and the price drops, but so far it seems not to be related with those attacks?

Sorry to interrupt your conversation.
My two cents here from my Spanish vision: I dont think Crypto is the only way to solution as Maduro is not the only problem. We are talking about a country were a can of tuna cost the same that 1million fuel litres 
There are a lot of undesirable situations and bad synergies in government that are being copied by the civilians, if you don't have good examples or significant others and you live in a country were is not easy to have common goods, internet connection, food, health care and others, is easy to give up, wait for international help or government care and just live on common things that are coming in drops. 
Many things has to be changed at many levels, unfortunately this situation is not new for Venezuelan population. I really hope Crypto plans goes on the god way and at least achieve something to start to believe. Don't care if Maduro's or others.
