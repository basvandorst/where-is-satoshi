Price per coin is a lot higher.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:16:24
At an all-time high.

Gemini only has ETH and BTC, but it is a great exchange. Use Binance for alts. Bittrex needs to verify you before you can withdraw anything.

The Zimbabwean dollar.

There was one of ~510 coins at $9850 on Gemini last night.

I think you're right.

I've lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... Or ratings in not sure which. I won't be silent . Just saw it live sry
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:19:20
Oh yeah.

We'll see. The fun is just starting.

I had a buy set for $3000 on Gemini, but cancelled it because I though it would bounce back a few hundred at best. Oh well. Not touching this until China gets out.

It's not necessarily a good thing if they're shorting.

Why the fuck would I use Bitcoin on Amazon when I can have my saved card pay for a purchase in five seconds? 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:15:34
What will you do if it drops to $2000 after the Chinese exchange ban is officially announced?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:36:49
Day or two? Wait at least a week. Bitcoin has been on a downward slide for the last two weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:09:29
Wait.

Bitcoin adoption is increasing and it's back on track to new heights. I hope.
