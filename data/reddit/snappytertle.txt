Inflation at it’s core is driven by an increase in money supply. In the US, this is manipulated by the Fed. Printed money devalues the currency, which hurts those holdings USD. It’s in effect, a tax. Printed money is used to monetize debt so the government can spend more than it collects, supported by inflation by increasing money supply.
Bitcoin aims to separate money from state. No central authority should have the power to transfer purchasing power without consent. The fixed supply of bitcoins is deliberate.

Are transfers taxed? I transferred to a different wallet.

The govt has no earning potential since it doesn’t produce. It can only leech off the private sector’s production. When it spends more than it collects (which it has), then it need to take on debt to finance its spending. We’ve gotten to the point where we need to issue debt to service existing debt. That’s the very definition of a Ponzi scheme.

I replied to your comment about public goods

When was the last time the Fed decreased money supply?

I know why multiple QEs were used. Just don’t agree with it. It’s not simple black and white like you think it is. You are narrow minded if you think it was the only way
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:16:13
Yes, in the US at least. We seem to be moving away from freedom lately though. 
Bitcoin can help slow down government spending/growth by not feeding into the Ponzi scheme of national debt.

The US hasn't missed and payment and is considered risk-free because it has a printing press to monetize more debt. The US govt can pay it's debt by inflating the currency. The risk-free status of US debt is partially responsible for inflating the bubble. Remember all the risk-free mortgages? No debt is ever risk-free. This allows the US debt to grow at alarming rates without people thinking twice about it. There is an implicit promise for the US to either raise taxes (hindering the private sector and hard to get elected unless you blame the evil 1% who can't even cover the debt alone), cut spending (no politician can get elected promising this), or inflating the debt away (most likely).
I am also skeptical of other currencies. The Venezuelan Bolivar is a prime example of why we can't just keep using inflation to pay off debts. The scale of US Debit is massive, which is why it's so worrisome. Imagine if the world's "strongest" economy suddenly went into hyperinflation.

You have it backwards. Printing money causes the value of the dollar to drop. It’s a vicious cycle where more and more money is printed, driving the value of the dollar further and further down.

The rules do apply. The debate is whether or not these rules are justified.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:17:11
I agree. There will just be some pain in the process.

What about the consumption driven economy that inflation creates? Debt is incentivized since what you owe will be worth less. Savings is disincentivized which reduces the capital available for companies to make investment that increase efficiency. Wages would also lag behind inflation bringing the need for people to complain about minimum wage every few years. 
Bitcoin being deflationary doesn’t mean there won’t be times of inflation. There will be cycles of inflation and deflation. It will be dictated my market forces rather than manipulated by central planning. The long term trend is deflationary because the economy will grow and produce more things more efficiently.

It also increases the cost to service the $20T+ of debt the US has. Only way to pay is to print more money. In other words, take out more debt to service existing debt.

Private market. Those are out of scope of government responsibility.

The low interest rates for the past decade inflated a giant bubble for the USD. Raising rates is moving in the direction for the bubble to pop. So it’s good since we are moving towards a less inflationary environment, but bad because we will have to go through the necessary evil of the bubble popping.

Separation of money and state

My response was in reference to all the public goods which are being used to justify paying taxes.

All the great empires in the past crumbled when inflation was out of control. Economic levers are bandaids to the problem and make things worse in the long run.

Finally, someone that understands why bitcoin was created. Why do we have socialists telling us to fork over our bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:00:07
Yep, we don’t need net neutrality regulations. We probably need less regulation so we can have more options with our ISPs.

We don’t have a choice. We are forced to pay and can’t opt out.

Makes me sad to see bitcoin has lost its libertarian roots. People are investing in it without knowing the purpose of bitcoin. It wasn’t created to give governments another currency to own...its goal is the separation of money and state 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:52:51
Investing in BTC just because it’s increasing so quickly is speculation. When the price falls, the same speculators will panic and pull out. That’s what I’m worried about. The price might be too high due to people getting in without understanding what bitcoin is trying to accomplish and looking for “easy” gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:22:31
Interest rate is still low and net money supply has increased.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:17:15
I would argue that economic levers are bandaids to a problem and make it worse in the long run

More importantly, it's a superior store of value. Think of it as  gold 2.0. It can't be manipulated (devalued/inflated) by central banks.

Is this a bill for tax exemption or a green light to tax transactions over $600? How will they adjust for inflation (they won't)
