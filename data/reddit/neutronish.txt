It's pretty clear that gox is screwing their customers. I expect a lot of people to be pulling out of bitcoin because of this... it's a huge black eye to bitcoin. The people who understand it are shrugging it off and know it's time for gox to die, but for everyone else, it's a big red flag to not use it.

I agree, all I see are cheap coins. It's just how long until the dust settles.

I doubt it. Any rebranding would be completed and tested before it was switched.

The reason I want to format that computer was unrelated to bitcoin.
I have it dual booting and my main parition is too small.

Plot twist: Target DOES accept Bitcoins...via Gyft.

@_date: 2013-10-29 19:47:25
the real question is...if you set one of these baby asics off on it's own, when will it find its first block.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:07:44
checkout the little raspberry pi for $35 if you haven't already. great way to learn about linux and they work great with xbmc for a media center solution.

*Shipping in 2 weeks...*

i just don't get at what point OP bought the btc with usd to start with in his story? Maybe he bought them when they were $10 each so his $100 meal really cost him a nickel..maybe he mined them with his gpu or maybe he chulkdoodled witcoins favorite stuff animal for it. who knows, but I think it's safe to say that he didn't buy BTC to buy a gyft card to buy a meal. He already held the btc before walkin in the place.

in a week when it is at $1500usd you'd look back and say "yes".
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:39:55

see that button on the right that says unsubscribe? try that , or rebooting might fix it
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:36:50
I don't get why you think the gyft thing is obnoxious? 
Once upon a time, I had some bitcoins that I used to buy a Target gift card with so I don't know my math isn't fresh but it works. 
@_date: 2013-08-20 01:01:49

@_date: 2013-09-08 21:38:29
I did create new addresses for each of the payments.
I am going to let it re-build the blocks and make a new backup before I format. I will need to be strict about making backups after every transaction and/or daily.
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:57:21
git er done.

You will see roi when it gets to $1k/btc which hopefully will be within the next year? yes i am drunk thank you for asking. Let me get my thread jack on. I was thinking since sr is gone which was the last blemish to bitcoin, the next step is the exchanges. so the exchanges need to be de centralized. the retailers neeed to accept btc and it will skyrocket. tell everyone. this isn't a bubble its going to go waaaaaay higher.  
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:00:25
$203 yea it's going to level out at about $245
@_date: 2013-08-20 04:34:18
Thanks, it's pretty awesome...already made 0.00017157 btc... which actually in a way makes me feel rich as fuck....it feels like it's worth something...vs these nasty fiat dollars I carry in my pockets. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 17:31:52
if they are going to tax it, they need to provide subsidies for it too
@_date: 2013-09-11 01:22:55
don't forget about that bitcoinbillionaire cat who was throwing around btc like oprah
I offset it on the low end with a .3 total
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:57:32
yea cuz ssh tunnels are sooo hard to setup. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:10:37
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:44:58
That's just mind boggling, My first guess would have been *Two Weeks™*.
The even crazier thing is, if the 1.5mil years is actuate, if we come back to this calcuation in a month or two, that figure will likely be 10-100mil years. Soon there will be a day where there will be +1P/hash a day added to the network. exo in a year or two.
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:51:43
I think the big red dragon has found where the secret fruit grow, so I'm going to out on a limb as say that it's going to probably be well over $1k within the next year. It's going sky high. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:04:50
damn rite.
retailers = de-centralized local exchanges 
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:59:25
Don't be too scared, bitcoin's strength requires more power than the sun has to break. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:26:55
i think someone popped the bubble
@_date: 2013-10-22 08:44:56
meow thats 3
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:39:50
getting local retailers all over to accept bitcoin is the way to get decentralized exchanges.
