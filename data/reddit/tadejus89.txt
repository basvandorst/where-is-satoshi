Lol. You are so delusional.
I can't wait to see how UK economy wil tank when they leave EU. There will be no special trade deals and sweets like now in EU.
And I'm so glad you british fu*** will get out of EU. Do you really think you count for something in the world now? You don't count for nothing, other countries are MILES ahead of you and you are one of the biggest american bit*** that do whatever they want you to do.
Also I laugh hard when I see delusional posts like Britain will reset their economy. They will reset it burn it to the ground.
I was thinking about you exiting years ago...you don't want to embrace Euro and you are constantly agaist EU.
Now you can f*** off and do something better completely on your own. 
But wait why fathers of Brexit after referendum was done immediately resigned? Why did Johnson shit his pants? Why half of your country still wants to be in EU?
Hahahah LOL

Its quite silly posting pictures like this over and over again. Actually who gives a flying fuck about that anyway :)

Then smash into pieces everything I've said based of FACTS.
EU didn't need Greece at all. Its like Greece needed EU more. 
Every FIAT currency is a dead man walking on a long term. It gets worthless. Dollar is in its final stages too. But I see brighter future for Euro than dollar.
Dollar is getting dumped by China and Russia. Those two are major players in crude oil trade. Second one is one of the biggest exporters and first one is the biggest importer. Selling crude oil directly for yuan instead of dollars is a big thing. Also China holds a lot of USA national debt.
They can crush USA if they want to. And when the time comes they will. 
But thats another topic. We are discussing Britain and your delusional dreaming.
What will you do without EU free zone and with british pound falling from the sky LOL?
I can go to London for peanuts and spend less thanks to your pathetic national currency.
You are a fool if you think Britain can do more on its own. Your purchase power is coming down. Those are the FACTS.
@_date: 2018-09-24 21:43:14
What the fuck are you talking about?
Are you out of your fucking mind or what? Countries pay certain amount of money into EU budget, more developed more and less developed less and they also receive more money from it in order to catch up with more developed countries. 
Also it benefits developed countries more to stay in EU zone because of free trade, no currency exchanges, no tarrifs, they can draft the best working force without much bureaucracy etc etc etc...
Britain will have to pay a hefty fee for that and they want to keep all benefits without PAYING into EU budget hahah :D Now when negotiating goes on and they see they won't get this, that clown Johnson resigned. UKIP hypocrate immediately resigned after Brexit was voted in. 
I think they didn't believe Brexit would be a success and when it is time to implement it, they've just run away and let others resolve to this mess.
EU survived it biggest mistake of all - Greece. Greeks scammed EU with their financial tricks and all german banks together. They actually bailed up those german banks and not Greece. And those stupid greek politicans are held to be responsible for that.
If Brexit actually happens, then you'll see how EU is finished. You know what. Britain has NO future. Of that I'm sure of. Because half of its population still lives in denial and think of themselves they still rule half of the world.
But in reality one communist country eats them for breakfast. Your economy can crumble and world goes on. 
You are not America. You are nothing in comparision to that. When USA goes down, whole world goes down.
If you ask me Russia, Norway, Canada and maybe to some extent Australia have bright future regardless what happens in the future. They have a lot of natural resources. Especially Russia. And their schooling is great. But they have that post communist syndrome...a lot of stolen public goods, oligarchs, corruption etc etc...
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:25:54
Lol. Neither do you.
Whole world is connecting and trying to form economic zones, unions etc and you really think that freakin Britain can do better on its own?
@_date: 2018-08-22 13:57:28
There are few good projects besides Bitcoin. Buy yeah 99% needs to die out.

You are delusional. TPP/TTIP is a scam of that I am aware of. EU on the edge of collapse? Which countries? Please elaborate this. 
NAFTA is a thing between America, Canada and Mexico. I don't know the details and I cannot comment on that.
But if you think that every single EU country can do bettere on its own is just plain STUPID.
Having one currency, no tariffs, less expenses overall, having one and single market is much more easier than 30 independent markets. Also EU can be easily the biggest world superpower combined economically and in terms of army power.
What can do Germany on its own? What can do Germany + other EU countries together?
What will Britain do when they leave? Banks will leave for Frankfurt, tariffs will be imposed etc etc.
No wonder british pound is nosediving lol. 
I laugh how anti EU propaganda has washed certain amount of british people. You clearly don't know jackshit about economy. 
The fact is Britain is worth SHIT in global terms. Powers like China can thrash them economically without a blink of an eye. You are not an empire anymore. You are basically tiny country which doesn't have any say in the world anymore. You will crumble beneath economic woes. 
Countries like China and yes Germany will always thrive because they are smart. Hell I see better future for Spain, France and hell even Italy than Britain. 
I can't see any single positive thing for Britain outside of EU. Oh there is one single populistic thing yeah, the foreigners and muslims. You won't have to accept them anymore and EU won't force you to accept them.
But the damage is done anyway. Even before refugee crisis you've accepted a LOT of muslims. LOL.
When UKIP leader immediately resigned after Brexit was voted, you clearly know they shate their pants. And now others have to clear up this mess.
But you won't get it.

C'mon where is 50k per Bitcoin? 
We'll have to wait for a while...
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:40:15
Ah c'mon...what is so fundamental wrong with it to say 50c is more probable? ��
@_date: 2018-05-18 13:16:18
15k for nows looks like a pipedream.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:10:58
How the fuck did they know that man had BTC worth 250.000$ in the first place?! Was he bragging about that big time?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:23:34
Haha :D Good one :D

You clearly do not understand what Bitcoin is. No one needs Bitcoin to implement a blockchain. Why the fuck would they need Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a great investment because it is scarce. Also with LN you could make instant payments. And thats all. And it has the first mover advantage. 
Anyone can make their own blockchain if they want to. Anyone can invent something better than blockchain too.
So? And as for reasons stated before I'm bullish on Btc. 
Also whoever thinks we will get quickly rich is mistaken. Surely if you win a lottery ticket with some random shitcoin going up like hell then yeah.
Personally I'm 100% in Icx since the beggining. Before I hodled BTC for quite some time. And I'll be back in it. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:45:46
Lol. Amazon would create a cryptocurrency tied to $ or some other fiat value. That wouldn't add to anything. Do you really think they would create a Bitcoin sort like of a cryptocurrency?
Bitcoin is SCARCE and it has a value till the day its unhackable. When it gets hacked its worthless. Just like your bank account. 
And comparing kid drawings with Bitcoin is laughable. 
As for now Bitcoin is a speculation, we speculate that a lot of people would invest in it in order to drive the price up and you can make almost instantaneous payments with it for peanuts. 
Also all alt coins are tied up to it (which I dislike). Everything should be traded against $,€ but that brings a lot of bureaucracy. With time and new regulations we could see clean and tidy market. 
Bitcoin is here to stay as some other good supplements and alternatives to it. For my taste some 30 handful cryptos should stay and get traded, everything else is obscene and obscure.

Lol instantaneously and free through your bank? Now during easter holidays? Are you fucking kidding me? Or you should try transfer big sums abroad out of SEPA zone. That costs a lot and is very slow. You gotta be fucking kidding me, I transfered around 80,000$ for couple of dollars and funds arrived in less than an hour 2 months ago. Try that with a bank.
