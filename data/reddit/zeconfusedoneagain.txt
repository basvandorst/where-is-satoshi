I love this one. Its secure, and its based in browser, with keys in your hand.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:39:07
Easiest, yes. Most everyone regrets it though. It is notorious for being down in times of need and takes for ever to continue. Try GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:39:52
Store it on a investment wallet. Do not trade until you get atleast 30+ hours worth of readings and knowledge about btc market trading. Attached a reddit post that talks about one of the best investment wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:50:08
That is summed up better than I could ever hope to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:30:55
Have you stored a secure wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:43:05
Definitely not. Filled with great info.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:47:40
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:46:50
Its not a gambling ring. Its a BTC faucet. It uses satoshis. I dont reap any rewards. Please do read it thourghly before jumping to conclusions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:59:03
This lovely post is amazing to understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:55:16
No guarantees. If you want a more secure software, use Blockchain. But, since its not a hardware wallet, the security cant be guaranteed to the same extent. But definitely safer than Nicehash.

How long ago was this?

legitimitizing- 
Scams- Just look up scams on and r/LocalBitcoins to understand possible scams that can occur.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:56:43
I would highly recommend doing so. I took the plunge a few weeks ago and every week since ive bough just a little more. We dont know the effects of futures being released, but we can hope! If you do decide to choose an investment wallet,  is my recommendation for one. The daily compounded interest made me feel tons better about myself, especially when there were dips.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:17
One side bets bitcoin's price will rise, and the other side bets the opposite. Winner takes the cash. No bitcoin is involved.
 this expands on it.

And is it a recieving address?
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:12:35
Bank transfer

Im in. You buying the plane?

Tesla. Hands Down.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:09:34
By hot wallet, do you mean trading wallet? or Investment wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:44:03
Try investment software wallet
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:33
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:46:34
YASS DUDE! Go for it!. I invested 20k of other peoples money in August, and made a huge bonus. As a previous redditor mentioned. YOLO. 
I used this investment wallet to earn a huge daily compounded interest, which was great on top of the btc price increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:47:46
LocalBitcoins, or a Bitcoin ATM ear by far the eaisest way to buy BTC if you are not verfied by an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:00:38
Honestly, not too much. BTC went the complete opposite direction after Nicehash was hacked. I think people are more worried about futures
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:07:41
We cannot do anything bout it, as there is no standard of order within regulating it. What we can do, is help newer members of community understand that Coinbase is not all it seems to be, as they make your 100 entrance bonus get taken with only a few transactions due to exorbitant fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:16:54
Truer words are unlikely to be written.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:40:35
Cex.io is great place.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:42:10
Coinbase absolutely sucks. It is notorious for the amount of time it takes. Hope it works out soon! Keep us updated!
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:10:52
LocalBitcoins.com 
Many bitcoin ATM's (with tellers) also allow you to cash in with on-the spot money.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:39:34
But to note, in Canada, Coinbase doesnt let you sell, you would have to transfer your funds to another wallet to sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:58:41
Whoops.  
Here you go.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:12:17
Lucky. Thats Quite Lucky. I understand your point, but I still would recommend it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:20:18
I made a new link. 
Does this one work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:29:07
Interesting. cryptowat.ch has it at 14100..
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:01:53
Did this one work?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:25:25
I follow this logic. I hope its true. I dont like a bubblers. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:21:27
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:24:51
Woot woot!
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:26:12
Wait. where did you see this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:38:07
Also recommend going to the BitcoinBeginners Subreddit. Eaiser to be heard.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:41:08
Honestly, I would buy now. But, its a risk, nobody knows what will happen when futures get unleashed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:17:38
Please read Community FAQ
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:37:15
1. Are you in the USA?
2. Pretty likely, but people always say that. No guarantees to anything with Bitcoin.
3. Honestly, I would just get the cash payment, report it to your tax group, and if you do feel like investing it, use those funds into bitcoin at your own time. There is no rush, nor will you feel overwhelmed, and tax becomes easier. On top of that, not all eggs in one basket.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:29:15
Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:53:10
Blockchain as a wallet. But Blockchain isnt a buy/sell exchange. If you want to buy sell BTc, use GDAX.
If you want some info on BTC, try the @_date: 2017-12-05 06:58:21
explained it really well.

Not a problem, US Citizen. But it services 99% of the countries around the globe.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:31:05
Whoops, sorry wrong response. You cant guarantee that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:34:01
Its not a scam, you can look it up. Its lesser known, but it is an absolutely great website. Honestly speaking, what makes you think its a scam?
The post I refer to actually talks about how it isnt a scam, despite its appearance.
But its your money, if you dont feel comfortable doing so, your choice. I can only do so much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:20
Best Plot Twist Ever. Like. EVER.
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:11:19
Cex.io is as safe as cryptocurrency can be atm. I got my money in 4 days, and from numerous friends of mine, their customer support is excellent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:52:01
Right before weekends.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:51:34
I love this one. It isnt just iOS, as it is on a browser, but is better than most of them.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:47:45
After that, who knows? You might go all in xD.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:45:40
Rofl. Have you tried Local Bitcoins or BitPanda?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:14:22
I think its going to be a huge spike upwards. But the problem is, what I think is just what I hope. Futures do not have guidelines  fully set right now, so it can be determined if they will help or hinder btc. Wall Street is an unpredictable Whale.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:59:18
Congrats! I hope it does you good. I would recommend a hardware wallet or Blockchain(Digital wallet).
I use a Trezor, it is an awesome piece of hardware and software. Trezor developers are big figures in this community and their hardware and software is made completely open source.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:53:09
This is the one I use. Gives Daily Compounded Interest!
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:22
What did you store it on
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:06:24
Bitcoin.com is a scam. No it wouldnt. 
Basically if you have a BTC wallet (NOT BITCOIN.COM) go to an ATM with the qr code to its receiving address on your phone.  You can buy the BTC there, and it will ask you where you want to send it to. Scan your Wallet Qr code, and Voila.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:21:46
I would like to make a point though. I dont know where you found mSigna, but it is an experimental wallet. No guaranteed results.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:47:34
It takes time. It normally always does.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:42:25
So is the problem that the crypto wallet isnt operating? 
Another question, why multisignature?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:46
I honestly dont think so. Try looking up the software wallets from whichever year it was from, and try logging into them?
Use whatever seems familiar, with the login that you think you used at that time period..
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:54:40
It is, but it is so much faster.

2 VERY excellent resources to learn about crypto. If you would like to, I would recommend @_date: 2017-12-05 06:19:31
I dont know, but I found a complaint on him.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:27:24
You can make money. But it takes extensive training to go through with it. I mean, hundred of hours of reading and learning about market manipulation. I flip on major dips, but otherwise, I keep everything on an investment wallet.
