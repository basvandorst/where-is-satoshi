Everyone in state/city/national/corporate debts, voting, and title registration is already trusting central authorities, willingly or unwillingly. Every debt you hold is through at least one, and likely several, trusted, centralized authorities already. What's the point of holding your Bank of America mortgage on a blockchain, for example?
Like I said in the OP, I get the case for bitcoin (or whatever ultimately rules), you're making a global decentralized currency. But when I trade securities, it's under SEC/FINRA, so no reason to have a blockchain. If I buy some Verizon bonds or state or muni bonds, again through multiple trusted authorities. If we want to improve titling of land, we just need to make a central database. The current inefficiency and frustration comes from lack of centralization. It's not like you can have "trustless" decentralized blockchain ownership of real property, because real property depends on recognition from the local ruling authority (state).

So a peer lending platform, plus decentralization/anonymity. Peer lending sucks. Most people prefer to take out house, car, and windmill loans from banks, because banks by and large offer better rates and terms. You can trade securitized debt instruments on real estate, cars, and windmills already. For example, I looked at BitBond, but it's awful vs alternatives, as both a lender and borrower.


No. Cars, houses, and windmills exist in jursidictions. You have to depend on the US federal govt, even with a blockchained lending platform, if the underlying houses/cars/windmills are American. Because you already have to rely on at least one authority, there's no reason for that authority not to just run a regular database, saving everyone time, cost, and difficulty.
People can trade securities anonymously already. Have you heard of dark pools?

I don't understand what you're saying. Try forming a sentence, please.

That's what I'm asking in the OP. Beyond a worldwide currency, which will be solved by bitcoin, or whatever "one true coin" supplants it.

You can do all those things and more. But there's no reason for state/city/national/corporate debts, voting, title registration to be on blockchains. Just put them on regular centralized databases, administered by the appropriate already-trusted parties. It's cheaper, faster, safer, better in every measurable way. You don't need a blockchain for any of these, and in every case you mentioned, a blockchain is significantly worse, and strictly dominated by, regular centralized databases.

would be a stupid place to use a blockchain. It wouldn't remove the need for a trusted 3rd party when ~~a house~~ real property is sold. Federal governments can take land whenever they want. The reason you feel that land registry is ripe for disruption is because it is. There is no central database, and many of the records are still physical, with no convenient, quick, cheap electronic access. But it's still something that should be a regular old database at whatever level(s) of government make sense: after all, you don't "own" land, you're just renting it from the government, on leases/liens, through property taxes, etc. The government can take land at any time, foreign governments can steal it through war, government can change taxes on property at any time, etc. The primary entity that needs to know who owns what land is the government, so they know who they're collecting taxes or taking land from, so obviously they can't be removed as a trusted party, and should host a faster, cheaper, safer, i.e. better in every way regular old database. If you traded houses on a blockchain that wasn't recognized by the government, you'd be in a world of hurt real quick.

Right... so audit trails should not be blockchained, according to you?
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:36:25


Irrelevant. It needs to be ***possible*** to implement. Explain how.
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:20:39
Wouldn't it be nice to have a house
@_date: 2019-10-27 02:44:27
But the question is. I can't imagine a pegged unit of account without an authority pegging it to something.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:08:55
Yes, that ***was*** the point. The point ***is***


Stop dodging the question, and fuck you for downvoting me.
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:56:35


Yep, that ***was*** a point of discussion IN THE PAST.
The ***current*** point, which you still haven't addressed, ***is*** that




OK, so don't bring up the "technological implementation". Noone asked for that. The other user asked for *how*, not technologically, not practically, not specifically, but just generally *how,* to have a pegged currency without authority.
You downvotey little bitch.
