Say you're a foreigner who has purchased bitcoin back home with local fiat.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to exchange your bitcoin to the machine for some local currency?  This is one of the scenarios the people in the bitcoin scene love to talk about.  "No more conversion fees" etc.

Thanks for the response, "2 way" is particularly useful for Bitcoin users who travel internationally, given that brick-and-mortar merchants rarely accept Bitcoin directly.

Any Bitcoin "ATM" that doesn't accept Bitcoin and return fiat isn't an ATM, it's a vending machine.  Does any installed Bitcoin ATM actually spit out fiat in exchange for Bitcoin?

As of right now, the [fee predictor]( says:


0.5mBTC fee would make you wait a long, long time for your transaction to make it into a block.

Exactly.  We don't hear about how low USD is becoming vs. BTC.
Almost all of the discussion on and elsewhere is purely about speculation.  Speculation is not investment.

Yeah, back in the early days, Bitcoin was pitched to merchants as an alternative to credit card transaction fees.  I suppose that's true still, but now the fees are paid by the shopper, not the merchant.
