I agree.  There has to be an incentive for the miners to validate the transactions in the blockchain and if these guys are pro-blockchain, they really need to be bullish on bitcoin as well.  How else do they expect a network to devote countless amount of resources to do something unless there's an incentive?

I hope Andreas addresses all of Joe's questions straight up first before he gets too deep into Bitcoin like last time.  It was a great podcast but it got too complex and Joe and Co. still think it's some sort of scam
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:55:31
2)  This one will be handled by the infrastructures being built.  I believe in the future, you'll be able to choose reputable companies to take care of your BTC the same way banks take care of your cash now.  The only difference is you can decide how divy up how you want your BTC to be secured.
4)  The network self corrects the difficulty.  The fewer miners there are, the easier it becomes to mine.
5)  The beautiful thing is that BTC is a global currency.  One man's garbage is another's treasure and some government somewhere will accept BTC with open arms.  These bans or restrictions only hinders innovation, it doesn't stamp it out.

@_date: 2014-09-29 23:52:43
2) I'm not sure I understand what the concern is then.  You mentioned that the inability to recover private keys is a problem.  I mentioned there are services and future services that will deal with this concern directly.  On top of a 3rd party insuring and securing your coins, there's also the option of self diligence with the M of N key transactions.  What's the concern here?
4)  If you're talking about how the mining reward will decrease by half every 4 years until it's completely fruitless to mine, then I'll agree that the incentive to mine will decrease as well.  However, it will be many years before the reward dries up enough that it's not longer profitable to mine.  And if Bitcoin is still around when that happens, a solution will be implemented.

I find it funny because when the price was $1000, I heard many people say I'm gonna buy a bunch if it ever drops down to $500.  $500 has come and gone and the same people are now saying they'll buy a bunch if it drops to $50.

This is a common issue that a lot of newcomers to Bitcoin cite and it's a very valid concern.  It's true, the confirmation time can be annoying.  However, for corner stores and other everyday uses, the tiny amounts people will be transacting will be immaterial enough that people can basically accept the transactions immediately.  
On top of this, in the future, there will most likely be middlemen companies who will assume risk of these transactions to make it more seamless to the consumer.

Litecoin is similar enough to Bitcoin that there isn't really an incentive for people to build applications for it right now.  Why waste energy on something like Litecoin when there's already enough skepticism on Bitcoin?  Before Litecoin can really start to take off with the same amount of developers as Bitcoin, Bitcoin needs to have already succeeded in the mainstream.

The quantity of cryptocurrencies doesn't matter as does the quality.  Bitcoin has the merchants, the developers, the consumers; and it's had a tremendous headstart.
The biggest thing about Bitcoin as well is if something else does do a certain feature better, Bitcoin can adapt that exact feature into its system.  Again, it's the infrastructure that's been built for the last few years that really keeps Bitcoin head and shoulders above everything else.

Why do these same rhetorics happen over and over again?  You invested during a time when it was absolutely ludicrous to be buying into Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has inherent value, however, the $1000 price tag was ridiculous.  Right now Bitcoin is hovering at around $400.. is that too low in your perception?  Your only reason for divesting is because you think people don't care but you fail to recognize that Bitcoin has only been in the mainstream attention for less than a year.  
Meanwhile, all indicators aside from price has been increasing yet you cling to the reason that nobody cares about Bitcoin.  I don't like to use ad-hominem attacks but this is a special case: you're a dunce and I'll still be here when you post again about your missed opportunity and how you were one of the "pioneers" who originally invested in Nov 2013.

Coinbase finally arrived in Canada recently, and being such a big company, I thought I'd give it a try.  My first transaction went through fine, but my second transaction was a huge mess.  Because I deposited the same amount within a few minutes of each other, Coinbase deemed the second transaction as a duplicate, even thought it was done through a different avenue.

It actually is the problem.  By creating awareness, naturally inquisitive people will look into it.  Bitcoin isn't for the lowest common denominator of people right now; it's a 21st century idea for 21st century people.  You're not going to get cat meme lovers to adopt it regardless of how you try to sell it.  
Many people know of Bitcoin, but they don't know Bitcoin.  Associating it with a dollar sign and giving it to random Joe Blows will likely provide some activity.  Even if 1/15 people actually take it further with the tip and learn Bitcoin, that's 1/15 more than there was before.  How does this not make sense to you, eThug?

If you take an objective look at Bitcoin, it already has taken off.  It exploded to over $100 in 4 short years.  Is it the de factor currency?  No.  It's an alternative currency in the most literal sense and I don't expect it to be the primary currency for a long time, if ever.  
The great thing about Bitcoin though is that it allows whoever wants to adopt it to do so easily.  There are stores all over my city that are accepting Bitcoins for services.  Like I said before, this is a 21st century currency for 21st-century-minded people.  It's not "going to" take off, it's already taken off.  All it needs is time and awareness to keep the growth.
When your 1 year old nephew grows up, he will have never known a time before Bitcoin.  Think about that for a second.

There really is no easy way to govern populations in the hundreds of millions.  We definitely need a government.. we just need to figure out a reform.

I'm thinking a vast minority is actually using it for goods ans services.  The consistent rise in current price right now just doesn't make sense for ppl to be using.. scary

If Bitcoin dies, the other cryptos will die too.  That's like saying diversify your stocks in the same sector.

The confusion comes into play when you view Bitcoin solely as a currency.  Bitcoin is an asset class the world has never had.  It's not quite a commodity but it's not quite a currency either.  It's both.. and it's sort of a bond.  It's this mixture that makes it very difficult to try and analyze the trend of Bitcoin with our current analytical tools.  To me, Bitcoin is more of a money transmitting tool at the moment, something that's much more easy to use with lower fees than Western Union.
