What do you mean up by 17%? 1 BTC is still only 1 BTC. (With a bit of /s towards those who said the above thing when it crashed)

Close to the border yes, but otherwise not really.

It is for those who bought at $20,000 in the hopes of it reaching $40,000.

Be that as it may, that in itself is not solid investment advice. You can't just say "Look, the line wiggled like this those other times, it's gonna wiggle like that again." You have to actually tie it to some sort of solid thesis.
Note: I'm not saying bitcoin is going to 0 or to 150 percent, I'm saying you can't base your trading on such simplistic "technical" analysis.

Read the fine print. You don't own a credit card. It is the bank's property.

No. Something that has always happened has no 100% guarantee that it always will happen. I'm not saying that it won't recover, just that past recoveries are no guarantee.

If you buy gold with a CC and then default on your CC, the bank can come and take your gold away. That's why they'll allow you to buy gold with a CC.

Whoops, I meant to reply to one higher. They guy talking about how he's paying fees to the bank to "own" a credit card.

Plus, VCs will understand that the majority of startups fail and go bust. That's the risk part of the risk-reward relationship. Those 100 retail investors tho? They'll probably raise hell and be a pain in the ass when their startup of choice goes bust and they won't see any mad gains, let alone their initial investment of $1000 back.

Ding ding ding.
A broken clock is right twice a day.
A thousand broken clocks, all stopped at different times? That's a lot of opportunities to be "right".
