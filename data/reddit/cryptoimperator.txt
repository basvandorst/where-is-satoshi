We wanted to make them accessible for everybody thats why we put that low face value.

You can look at it as Bitcoin gives people freedom and breaks the old financial system chain, or you can understand that the chain is closing (Adding a new block) and so the Blockchain is the strength of BTC

We've been on the market for quite some time, this is our third coin released to the market (Previous one were Doge themed)
We have been trusted by tenths of customers all around the world, but if you don't, something we absolutely respect, we offer a DIY version of the coin (You get the Coin and Hologram and it is your responsibility to generate the key)

Making coins is not cheap, and besides designing it there are minting and hologram costs (All custom made). We try to offer a product similar to Casascius coins.

When the last 3 coins of the limited edition (numbered 11-100) are sold.

You have to consider also the collectable/numismatic value of the coins.
