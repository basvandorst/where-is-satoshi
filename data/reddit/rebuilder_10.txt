I was specifically thinking of a compromised CA, since the warning referred to a state actor and specifically mentioned the chinese being most likely to be targeted. So independent sources have to include something other than websites encrypted via https.

But if all your transmissions are subject to modification by the attacker, they might substitute the real key for a false one whenever it appears. IOW, if your only check is to look it up on different websites, ans your adversary can perform MITM attacks on web traffic including https, you can't be sure you're seeing the right key.

I don't know. It's not the kind of thing that should be decided by central planners, but by the market. 
What do you think the average fee for a transaction should be? How do you come up with a number for that? How do you determine what volume of tx is best?

I'm saying it doesn't make much of a difference, unless you're saying that the multi-year growth rate of the block size has been manipulated for nefarious purposes. We're hitting the blocksize due to growth, the effect of any spam attacks is pretty negligible compared to logarithmic growth.

If we're not nearly secure enough now, that's really bad news for Bitcoin IMO. Security is *damn* expensive as is, if we can't do cheaper than several percent annually, the store of value use case goes out the window. The thing is, there's no direct way to gauge it, and no market mechanism I'm aware of that would properly balance security vs. risk of attack vs. potential profitability of said attack. This of course is separate from the blocksize issue.

What happened is that the software doesn't write itself, humans do. The choices those humans make have effects similar to political decisions.
A hard fork is like a gun in the room. You might need it for something, but mostly everyone wants it to just be left alone. Your solution appears to be to try to stop anyone from talking about the gun.

That doesn't really lead me to any idea of how to make things better. 
Thanks for the discussion.

Are you saying the logarithmic growth in blocksize is a BU long con? The growth rate has been fairly constant for years now.

I'd say we're in the process of determining whether the market prefers central planners or not. 
But the level of security - how secure should we be? The last I checked, block subsidy+tx fees amounted to a 7% yearly cost for holding BTC. Mainly this was due to block subsidy, and I believe it was before the last halving. So it might be about 3.5% now. How much is enough? How much is too much? If you want central planning, you have to have a way to answer these questions.

I'm going to quibble a little with your first issue: It's not about whether or not we should have a fee market. A fee market exists, and will exist as long as miners can choose what fees they find sufficient to process tx. The biggest distortion to the fee market currently is the block subsidy, followed by the block size cap. 
The block subsidy is just that, a subsidy paid by BTC holders to effectively lower the cost per transaction. The block size cap in turn sets a lower bound on the cost per transaction, although it's not clear what that bound is as only the supply of tx space is controlled, not the demand. But a fee market does exist in any case.

By way of "tips", or transaction fees, of course! What does that have to do with blocksize? Miners are free to set fees as they like.

Ok, not such a great idea to not declare taxes when the card is in your name, IMO. Those crypto cards are sure to be any up-to-date government's radar.

Those require ID, afaik.

Compare the frequency of stock markets tanking, say, 20% in a day vs. Bitcoin doing the same.

Not everyone has to update, in a hard fork, although it won't go too well for the nodes on the minority chain. The majority chain will work either way.
A softfork avoids that but also removes a check on developer power. Instead of opting in to significant changes, as with a hard fork, users must opt out if they disagree.
Your argument that users running older versions is a good thing is... curious.

Thanks, if you can help.
