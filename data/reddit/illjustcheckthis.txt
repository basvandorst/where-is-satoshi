I mean, the system proposed doesn't make sense since it removes incentives from miners. But with that he is suggesting, the reception order is not needed to be guaranteed, they'd just put the TX's in the block in order they are recieved. Of course miners could modify the client and simply say they recieved tx's in the exact oder of higher feed-transactions, since it's their prerogative what to include in the block.

I wouldn't take a paper wallet like that. Even if the public key is correct, they could replace the private key with a non-functional one.

I'd argue that Bitcoin does have intrinsic value, by definition. Its value is in securing transactions and fast value transfer. That is the real value that Bitcoin has and that could make it satisfy the definition of a currency by the Regression Theory.

A couple orders of magnitude is still a lot. There are people right now investing in things that hope to get a return on that investment in 10 years, maybe double it in a quarter of a century. Even if the value "only" doubles, I think you don't realise how much that actually is.

Hal Finney is an amazing person. Few people inspire me as much as him.

Maybe he knows just as much as the rest of us and actually believes the dude might be the real deal, but has no evidence.

Could we close the mixers so he doesn't have a way to "wash" the bitcoins?

So what would stop Bitcoin from being backed up by the very same things? 
Eliminate nation from the phrase. Imagine that nations would want to implement some sort of global currency.Would it not look very similar to Bitcoin? It would probably not be deflationary, be physical money and not backed by crypto (that is one of the big pluses of it, not a minus) and would have a different distribution method. Pretty big differences, I'll admit. But you are not attacking those differences, you're attacking the fact that bitcoin is not backed up by any nation. Besides that, what if some nation somewhere, would agree to accept taxes paid in BTC. Would you accept its validity then?
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:59:56
I know what you're saying, but my point was the Bitcoin has intrinsic value in the same way a car that transports money has intrinsic value.
It's not just money, it's a secure value-transfer technology. Would you say that a secure value-transfer-technology has value? This is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin.

They can't. But once you send your bitcoins to them, you don't know where they are, they're in the Gox system. What you see there is a shadow of them, Gox reassuringly saying: "Your bitcoins are here, shh now...". Whether that is true or not remains to be seen.

Hey, I'm very interested by the technical aspects behind Bitcoin, so this kind of technical articles are exactly what I'm looking for. 
I'll look over it this weekend more in depth.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:17:01
Let me argue. Mixing is only useful if enough other people input legit bitcoins into the mixer. So big amounts of tainted bitcoins need big amounts of clean bitcoins to enter the tumblers. For all intents and purposes, this is a huge amount. You can't just shove it all right in in one big swoop, you need to gradually wash them. If a deal was struck with the biggest tumblers to simply not accept bitcoins in that batch then he would have to trickle it down far slower through other smaller tumblers, so it takes a longer time.
At most, it's annoying for the thief, but it buys you some time to maybe find other ways to track them down and it reduces the legit bitcoins that the fake ones get tumbled with, lower search array if you want to try tracking them after the tumbling. Although I'm pretty sure the thief will gradually and repeatedly mix them so this measure will just make everything just slower for him and not help the eventual tracking at all.
Also, the beauty of Bitcoin is that it's potentially anonymous, so I guess not a lot of people are interested in tracking these coins and potentially chipping away from that value.

I think it is feasible building some sort of firmware checksum or checking algorithm to make sure your device has the correct, un-tampered firmware on it.
At the end of the day, security is always going to be an ongoing race between a would be intruder and the legitimate owner. You can just make it improbably hard for the intruder to gain the information desired.

Eeeeh... true... kind of...but money is a zero sum game... If money were not a zero sum game, then simply printing $$ would not cause the value of a currency to decrease.

To be honest, your friend does have a point. Not necessarily about BTC failing, that may or may not happen. But that if you know that a bubble is rolling, you should sell when the price is high and buy back when the price goes bust. Selling your BTC and then getting them back at a better price is advantageous to you and it's silly not admitting that.

I'm not really paranoid, but this would be a decent move to infirm the existance of the tapes from a supposedly Rusian controlled wikileaks. Put ransom, don't cash it(since RU would have the tapes and it would be stupid to release them) =&gt; people dissociate WL from RU and start believing there is no tape. This works good for them if the tapes exist or not all the same.

Eh, even if it is a buble, I bought 0.31 when it was at @ 300. My first purchase. it's not a lot of money but if this is when Bitcoin reaches critical mass I don't want to miss it.
I expect the bubble will burst at some point. When the price is stabilizes I'll buy more and just hope Bitcoin finally goes mainstream.
It's just bad if they sell when it's low. I'm pretty sure Bitcoin will live to see better days, higher prices and greater stability.

I just posted a question about this but I seem to get downvoted to oblivion. Apparently, my question was moronic, so i'll post it here.
So if Bitcoin becomes a major player in the global market, what will happen with the other currencies? If a BTC gets at, let's say, 1 million $, what will happen with the dollar?
I see it only normal that if a Bitcoin's value increases, the value of the dollar decreases. We could see a huge inflation in the other currencies because of something like Bitcoin.
And that would bring a lot of problems.
So what do you think would happen?
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:02:36

Thought about BIP38? I want to implement a BIP38 capable HW wallet but I don't know how feasible is to implement BIP38 on MCU's and I don't know exactly how to keep the device as small as possible while still having a decent way of imputing a password on the device. 
This is still theoretical, mind you, but it's my current free time baby/most likely dissertation paper.
Is your code posted anywhere or do you intent to keep I for yourself?
By masking I suppose you mean toggling on the 1 bits, right? Or is there some other, better way you thought about?

They apply a price with a formula. So it's sort of: bitstamp*1.05. It's the seller's fee. You've got to realise that not everyone is in the US and it's really hard getting/sending money to one of the exchanges over there.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:32:40
If you adjust for inflation the $850 mean $2370 in in 2013. The price is almost half.

How could they opperate to constrict this money supply? The money is already in circulation. Do the banks have enough reserves that they just destroy the money they have?
I think this could be very very bad, and all disruptive technologies had their victims.
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:38:10
You are right. But I see a lot of new projects surrounding BTC and new ways to spend them are popping up VERY fast. If you get enough ways to spend them, it's done, you can't stop it them.
The part about policy attitudes is true, this is very important. And I never thought about this until now, that this strong peak of value will solicit a policy response. It rings true.
Yet, I believe(and hope, this might be a little bit of wishful thinking) that the policy response will be a framework meant for guiding bitcoins and its development(I.E.: You have to pay your damn' taxes, witch is fair) rather than outright banning it. The reason for my theroy is that:
1) The US government is aware of Bitcoin and the problems it poses, but they don't want to ["stifle a potentially valuable technology"](
2) Criminalizing it would just move it underground, supporting it as tool for crime instead. It would not disappear, it would just break it's value for good. That sounds pretty stupid in my book. 
Nonetheless, even without criminalizing it, they could issues policies that would cripple its value in the US. Still, it's not the only country where its value lies with and I hope policy makes are not that stupid or malicious. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:46:25
Oh, normal currencys will still exist, I have no doubt about it. But if Bitcoin gets big enough like, say, the value of all... YEN, let's say, how much would it affect other currencies?
