did he wag his finger at you as well?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:20:18
woohoo! I thought I was the only one. BitFlyer is possibly the best run exchange in the world. I'm so happy they opened a branch in the U.S.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:33:18
works for me.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:37:24
the potential concept is "first in, first out" money. meaning when you "spend" bitcoin, the government will tax you on the oldest bitcoin you own. a complete disaster in the making. we should start electing people with higher than 70 IQ's and slightly less sex-addled. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:48:22
No I do not. We do not need the specious oversight of a bunch of morons. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:29:33
wahn, wahn, whan..... ya twat.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:22
Try out Bitflyer U.S. as well. Very quick and easy sign-ups. Minimal personal info needed to start.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:50:17
[ have I mentioned BitFlyer has an english site? I started using them (quite happily) this week and damn if I'm not even happier now. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:11:23

@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:25
they're just bored.

Bill Miller is the guy with 50% in BTC. It's his hedge or nothin'
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:20:29
which is why we recommend Litecoin as a replacement. Please pass this along to Valve. Don't want them to miss out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:39:20
EDIT: EDIT: make sure they don't wet themselves ~~tomorrow~~ this afternoon when we hit ~~$17k~~ $19k
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:09

I agree with you. somebody should get on that. I'd love to have a paywall on my e-mail. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:20:53
Intriguing. can you name the program you use?
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:04:41

@_date: 2018-12-20 00:16:05
yes. we'll have atms that can bounce private keys around to get you funded when needed. Probably even spit out charge cards like those laundry mats.
