You lost me at destroying governments. Do some of you guys really think that A) bitcoin can do this B) this is a good thing?

They arn't bad, surprisingly. At least until you get to the dregs.

You invested in a "foreign" currency and made a profit. Depending on the country you might need to pay taxes on that. In the US you do for sure. Same for gold. 
At the very least you need to talk to a professional, or start wondering how you are gonna hide it from the IRS.

Well, escrow in bitcoin, *if I understand the protocol correctly*, wouldn't give the coins to anyone, they would sit in limbo unaccessable until two of the three parties agreed to release them. 
The rest of your point is the same, those coins are still out of commission for a year. This is dumb in both fiat and bitcoin, it can be put to much better use in either.

Its not an AMA, its him saying lines as requested in the movie subreddit.

It would be a little funny if they sit on it like that, look back later and see they have a treasure trove. Then bitcoin bails out the US government. 
I would chuckle.

Slightly ironic don't you think?

I entirely agree, and I don't blame you at all. Its a weakness of bitcoin until it gets setup.

You can put real money INTO eve, you are not supposed to be able to get real money out. CCP does a pretty good job cracking down on RMT.

Say you are in the US, you still have to pay tax on gains you make in foreign currencies.

The top comments in there have sparked an actual discussion and most comments not asking for more info seem reasonably well informed already. Nice. Very nice especially considering its Worldnews, which is not exactly the pinnacle of open-mindedness and fair discussion. 
Tips are raising awareness, while and not being spamed too.

How can bitcoin replace the trading of stocks?
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:01:39
That's what I figured.

Its like they are trying to make money or something. Its a gigantically popular and easy to use online store. They charge that much for the same reason you are agreeing to pay that much. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:02:00
Whats the point in that? Its the same thing isn't it?
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:15:26
He mentioned those in the article as well, how does it do that?

Along with this, it is difficult for some people to understand the technology behind bitcoin. Understanding how its secured, how mining works, and the like. 
When my parents were my age, the technology simply did not exist. I'm not surprised they are skeptical, it can seem very sketchy to someone from a different era. I mean how can people make money just by "mining" with a machine that looks just like another weird computer, and how can that money be worth anything in the "real world". I don't blame them. Patience is key. Its kind of mind blowing once you back up a bit.
