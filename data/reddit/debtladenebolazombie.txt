Not clearly at all: the whitepaper postulates some magical OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY opcode without explaining how it works or the security+incentive ramifications (which are the entire problem).  Then in *the appendix* they hand-wave a bit about "federations".
Also, isn't it a bit backwards to say that the soft-fork must come before the prototype of the post-fork rules?

This Ripple-style centralized system is not even a prototype of something that could eventually hope to become a final solution.
Seriously, **sidechains were sold to us as a replacement for decentralized altcoins.**  I just want to point out that the sidechains folks have still not produced a prototype of such a thing, or even a complete and coherent description of a hypothetical prototype.  Probably because it's a lot easier to poke holes in a prototype of an unworkable scheme than in unworkable vaporware.  I have the utmost respect for the people involved in the effort, but their "make miners magically vanish" scheme simply doesn't work.  Smart people do make mistakes sometimes.
I don't object to what they've posted being incomplete.  But it's not even trying to be a prototype of what they originally billed it as.  I think they ought to publicly retract the "THIS IZ TEH ALTCOIN KILLAH" propaganda.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:01:26
Before a soft fork can happen, a prototype of the post-fork codebase must exist.
They still haven't even made a prototype of decentralized sidechains.
Heck they haven't even proven it's *possible* to build a prototype.

This is turning into Ripple 2.0; terrifying to see Back himself write this:


So, bottom line, they still cannot figure out how to make the "sidechains" dream work without a central trusted party.
Which is pretty much what the altcoin world (icky as it is) has been telling them for the better part of a year now.  The game theory doesn't fit in a single post (and most people don't have the patience anyways), but you can't just magically wave a wand and make miners unnecessary.

Much respect for the people involved, but I think they need to come clean here and admit that what they've delivered does not in any way resemble the decentralized-altcoin-killer they so loudly declared their project to be.

With all due respect Luke, *this* is the nonsense!
People keep throwing around this phrase as if such a thing exists.  It never has and still doesn't.  Until today people kept saying "wait for the blockstream alpha release"... well, it's here and it doesn't even attempt to deal with this.  What next, "wait until after the fork"?  That's some [pass the bill so you can see what's in it]( nonsense...
There are very serious flaws in the incentive structure of all proposed mechanisms for creating some sort of "decentralized sidechain".  The centralized-federated-functionary system hides these flaws behind a trusted third party, just like Ripple does.
Sidechains are fundamentally centralized (Ripple-like) and fundamentally only SPV-secure.

I'd like to see a proposal for OP_SIDECHAINPROOFVERIFY.
I'm somewhat astonished that this big dust-up doesn't even attempt to include one.
Frankly, I don't believe one can exist that (a) has a stable incentive structure and (b) in any way qualifies as a "replacement for altcoins".  We've had the Turing-complete script language debate already; how to they propose to encode every possible block-validation rule of every possible cryptocurrency innovation, including those not yet hypothesized?

Almost all large water heaters run on natural gas.
Using electricity to make heat is dumb, and only done on very small scales (dorm room electric heaters).
Lastly, even an electric water heater is on for less than an hour a day.  Those things are insulated like crazy.  You shower, it refills with cold water, heats for a half hour, then sleeps the rest of the day.  Crappy ROI.
This whole thing is such fail.

That's a bad idea if the data is "hard but misinterpret".
Don't fall into the trap of assuming that demand for your-service-paid-in-bitcoin from your existing customer base is in any way correlated with demand for your-service-paid-in-bitcoin from the general public.  I'm guessing that without that differentiator you can't beat my current voip provider, which is why I'm not currently your customer.

You're certainly right that this is why VCs will never be happy about their money going to make folks whole here.

Now that's just not true.
I've been using bitcoin since 2010, and I use btc-e because they defy immoral AML edicts, which they can only do because they operate anonymously.
So there is another very real, and in fact even better reason for them to have such anonymity.  **They need it in order to provide a service that customers like me demand** and are willing to pay a premium in order to obtain.
That said, the possibility that the expense of that anonymity is partially subsidized by organized crime is a fascinating theory which would resolve the biggest paradox at the moment: why is the **oldest bitcoin exchange** and **least recently hacked** bitcoin exchange also the most anonymous one?  That's quite a mystery.  If anything I'd expect operating anonymously to lend itself to fly-by-night operations that get robbed-hacked by their owners like bitcoinica, and yet btc-e has proven itself more robust than any other bitcoin exchange in the history of ever.

"Blockchains" in the simplest sense were around before bitcoin.  See, for example, git: chains of blocks each hashing the one before it.
*Mined* blockchains were bitcoin's innovation.
Until the whole crypto 2.0 fad this was so obvious that people didn't have to say "mined" and just said "blockchains".  Unfortunately the crypto 2.0 crowd seems to need to be reminded.

There is nothing normal about that.
The exchange is in charge of policing margins; they are on the hook if the margin calls fail.  Otherwise they have no incentive to police margins properly.  Moreover, this is the only thing that entitles them to a profit.

The thief can just cycle the stolen coins to a new wallet in every single block, thereby mixing the coins with every other coin sent in those blocks.
The thief can easily afford the transaction fees to do this for a week.

Credit Unions can't send wire transfers themselves (they have to use larger "correspondent banks" to do this).  They hide this fact from you until something goes wrong, and then blame it on the Big Bank You Didn't Know You Were Really Using.  It's in the 20 pages of fine print you signed.
So unfortunately, you can't use credit unions if you need reliable international wires.
Not their fault, the system sucks, but it's not a no-brainer the way you make it seem.
