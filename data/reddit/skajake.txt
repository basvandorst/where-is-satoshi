That would be considered supporting the consensus, not breaking it.. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:14:09
If 75% is not consensus, than what is, the 25% side?  If consensus requires 100% then we certainly do not have consensus today because a large number of stakeholders do not agree with the current state of affairs.  It seems to me the term consensus to you  means "Play by my rules or GTFO".
As far as being on topic, this thread is certainly on topic to the sub-thread that I branched off of your original post.  You are the one that decided to engage me on this topic, so I am not sure why you keep complaining about it.

If 75% of the hash rate adopts BIP 101, then it will be Core which will be considered breaking with consensus.   Or maybe consensus to you means whatever rules are dictated by the Core developers?

Having the port forwarded on your router simply makes it possible for other nodes to initiate inbound connections to your node.  Failing to forward the port means only your node can initiate outbound connections to other nodes.  It has absolutely no bearing on what communications/transaction &amp; block relaying that occurs once you have established the connections.

Also one does not send btc to a public address.  Rather funds are sent to a script.  The script requires a signature who's public key hash matches the hash specified in the script.
Same outcome, but nuanced difference from how I understood it as a newbie.
@_date: 2015-06-22 03:17:04
Every bitcoin transaction actually pays to a script.  To redeem the money, the recipient needs to be able to provide data that causes the script to resolve to true.
A multsig transaction sometimes pays to a script which contains the M public keys and the opcode that requires the spender to provide N signatures.
A vast majority of multisig transactions however actually use P2SH.  This means they pay to a script which contains an opcode and a hash that requires the redeemer to provide a valid multisig script (that matches the hash) AND provide the N signatures.  In this particular case the pub keys are by definition obfuscated until the redemption of the funds.
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:14:09
Jon Matonis misses one major difference.  An increased block size is a huge benefit for the ecosystem and a promised follow through of the social contract that bitcoin would be allowed to scale up.
Changing the coin cap is in no ones interest.

I feel bad for people like Larry.  I is hard to blame such a seasoned financial expert for their cynicism.  After all, up until this point in time, 100% of all investment scams were tied to certain individuals or businesses.  100% of these scams ended in disaster.  To someone like Kudlow, this event marks the end.  After all, when issuers and marketers for the likes of egold and liberty dollars had their heads lopped off, it spelled the end for the underlying asset.
Bitcoin however is different.  We have never seen anything like this in the history of the world.  Such new concepts are hard for an old dog to learn.   Lets cut them some slack as they live in their bubble of ignorance.

stealth addresses are still addresses and come with all the advantages.  Also, if you want privacy, do you really think you will use the payment protocol?
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:00:00
Unfortunately Coinbase often takes exorbitant amounts of time from the moment you initiate a payment until they finally relay it onto the blockchain.
Last time I used Coinbase, the transaction was delayed 24 hours causing my Bitpay invoice to expire.  I had to contact the vendor directly to get a refund.  Not a great experience.
Until they can make certain assurances around transaction relay times, I will not be using Coinbase as a spending wallet.

I hope it is finally becoming clear to people why there is so much opposition to block size increase.  All you have to do is follow the money.  Blockstream devs have received funding to the tune of tens of millions of USD to solve Bitcoins scaling problems through out of band protocols.
These devs are terrified because simply scaling up bitcoin "core" is a direct threat to their source of funding.

A double spend is possible if you send money to the merchant and publish this to the p2p network. Next you have to generate a block containing a double spend of the same inputs. You need to generate this block before anyone else on the network is able to.

A couple thoughts.
1. Changing the license was a horrible knee jerk reaction and I'm glad you realize that now.  Take it as a lesson learned and move on.
2.  Retroactively changing the license on code already released under another open license smells like a very gray area legally and probably couldn't be upheld in court anyways.
3.  Keep yourself lazer focused on your consumer, don't worry about the crappy Chinese knockoffs.  Your customers know the difference.  There is a reason Apple is the worlds leading smartphone manufacturer despite the sea of android crapware.

The fact that the address begins with a "3" indicates that it is a P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) address.  This address format is slightly newer than the traditional pay to pub key addresses.  Some slowpoke services have not yet added support for P2SH.
As an aside, a P2SH address can represent any type of script, don't assume it is multisig.

It's a managed risk yes I understand that.  A risk that can be mitigated even further with double spend relaying.  Zero conf works fine in practice and is an acceptable risk level for small to medium retail transactions.  Why are you so hell bent on taking this choice away from users?

Peter Todd is the main instigator of the anti-scale bitcoin movement.  If the core devs don't squelch him soon, bitcoin will be in serious trouble.
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:12:23
Of course the risk cannot be mitigated.  Risk management does not seek to mitigate risk.  It seeks to manage exposure to risk.   For example, the chance that the miner about to solve the next block in a 350 petahash environment is colluding with a guy trying to buy a cup of coffee is about as close to zero as possible.

@_date: 2013-12-19 03:09:42
Let us try looking at this using simple arithmetic.  Lets say you have $1,000 to invest.  Now say you invest when the price of BTC is at $1,000 per BTC so you buy 1 coin.  Now the price plummets 50%.   Then you turn around and sell your 1 coin for $500.  Your overall loss:  $500.
Now alternatively, lets imagine the price of BTC was only $1.00.  Now with your investment you were able to purchase 1,000 coins!  Suddenly the price plummeted 50% to $.50 per coin.  You sell your 1,000 coins and receive $500.  Your overall loss: $500.
Do you see now that the impact of the price change on your investment was IDENTICAL.  It makes absolutely no difference how big the actual price drop was.  ALL that matters is the percentage change.  
Now maybe you understand why serious investors use the log chart?

ok with you so far.


Mayday Mayday!  You see by very definition the same percentage of two different numbers are un-equal.  You could say that this sort of scheme promotes inequality as two people receive the same service but one person is forced to pay more.


This is true, people do move do to taxation policies.  According to the New York Times, millionaires are considering leaving high tax states like California.  


I tell you what, since you believe so highly in wealth redistribution, I will make a deal with you.  I will agree to a one time redistribution of all wealth in the world so that everyone is on a completely even playing field.  My only condition is that you abandon once and for all any further attempts at redistribution.  deal?


The real reason there is a difference between rich and poor is that half the population will squander money on lines of credit and the other half delays pleasure by plowing portions of their income into business investments.  


I have seen first hand how wealth redistribution makes people dependent on others for their existence and I can tell you it is not better for society as a whole.

Ripple allows anyone to issue a currency.  These currencies are issued as IOUs.  Payments "ripple" through existing trust lines and across currencies using the distributed order book.
