This is legit, they have been working on it for ages. I have a feeling they were some of the folk who helped get the HMRC to reco, from their site: gnize BTC. I am giving it a go. Been waiting ages for this and it arrived on my real life cake day!
Edit: thanks for the downvotes from their site: Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs certificate number 12713897

Yeah, if it doesn't involve SEPA I am happy, otherwise its back to localbitcoins and kraken when I am feeling flush.
UK banks really need to be a bit less conservative, from the loom of it though it could be SEPA deposits :(
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:23:59
If its sepa based I will stick to Kraken, if not its a no brainer for anyone buying btc (above board) in the uk.

Yeah its absurd that some think there should be one coin to rule them all. For people who tout decentralisation they sure have no idea what a single point of failure is.
@_date: 2014-06-03 07:25:53
Yeah, me too. I would like a white paper on this from joepie91.

I have been doing business a long time and I understand your issues with slow payment. I also understand that nobody wants another gox or NnB.
The problem is that on reddit things that could and should be sorted in a professional way end up becoming raging dramas and witch hunts. My original comment about OP needing to be more transparent still stands. Any faceless group of individuals can demand things and spread fud. But how do we know that "cryptotruthgroup" is not just one guy with a vendetta or a competing company/exchange.  We can't just go on a witch hunt because some faceless redditor for 12 hours stirs up the shit.
I have been here for 5 years and I have seen some bad things happen to innocent people because of mob mentality. 
Threads where long time users (who are notable web comic authors) start getting death threats on their home phone because a couple of redditors thought he was lying about his polyamorous relationship.
The Boston Bombing detective drama, where reddit pinned it on a missing kid who turned out to actually be dead.
Cancer victems trying to raise money who all of a sudden are believed to be scammers, they start getting death threats and weird mail, then it turns out they did actually have cancer.
If you are having issues getting money back go to Citizens Advice Bureau or your local equivalent. You will get better results than here.
As a contractor sometimes I have to wait months for my pay. It sucks. My bank manager always tells me to do a business credit check on anyone I work with. It costs 5 bucks and will tell you liquidity of a company. In a couple of months Moolah's first filings should be available through companies house and everybody who cares can have a look at the data.
There is no need for a witch hunt. Sadly reddit, as much as I love it can be very mobbish.

Vice is one of the last bastions of real journalism. I love the way it has gone from essentially being a bit of a troll publisher to an investigative powerhouse. Things started to get serious when Shane started doing the travel guides.

In Spain it depends who catches you. If its the Guardia its tax, of its the Policia Local or the harbour police its a bribe with a reciept written on the back of a cigarette packet ;)

Its python dude, you can probably run this on Windows with a few tweaks.
There is even a run.bat in the github repo.
I would not be keen to run this on my windows 7 desktop. Its easier an safer to just fire up an linux vm in VMware Player and install it with four commands.
@_date: 2014-09-14 07:32:54
Besides that, I did say you could probably run this on Windows, however why would you deploy this on Windows? Doing a live deployment on a Windows server would just be a pain in the ass to maintain.
Sure open Bazaar oes not have many dependencies, but anyone who develops python on Windows knows what a ball ache it can be. Then there's the licensing costs and the headaches associated with using webservers like apache and nginx on Windows.
Why spend hours configuring Windows when you can install this on ubuntu with 4 commands.
    git clone 
    cd OpenBazaar
    ./configure.sh
    ./run.sh

Woooah this is pretty awesome. I have plenty of stuff I can take to them!

More fud about Moolah? Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?
Give them a break. They are a young and enthusiastic crew. Don't mistake their youthful enthusiasm and lack of experience of scaling businesses for scammyness.
I would give them the benefit of the doubt right now.

I can see why you are upset. I hope you get it sorted man.

HMRC do a lot more than collect taxes. In order to comply with money laundering regulations you need to be on the Money Service Business Register

The good old dipstick test works instantly, no need for a lab team, just a nurse.


If you have ever been pulled by customs you would know that they love playing games to trip you up. They will make stuff up on the spot to intimidate you and get you to slip up. Best rule of thumb when getting arrested is to shut your mouth.
French customs are especially pissy and unreasonable not unlike the Spanish Guardia who seem to make it up as they go along.

ITT: An ANONYMOUS group of "concerned" crypto currency enthusiasts demand the owner of a registered LTD company identify himself.
1) OP should identify themselves, get it in the open.
2) OP should demand BTC-E identify themselves too, who are those guys anyway?
3) OP should harass everybody who has ever registered a company through an agent and used them as company secretary or registered office.

They are probably playing it super safe, we live in a nanny state after all.

So do half the moolah.io crew but it seems the young uns have the balls for it
@_date: 2014-05-09 09:12:27
They do this in Spain already and not just for tax. Parking tickets, fines, unpayed bills. Boom, straight out your account.

Some of these innovations would require a massive hard fork. I don't think that is going to happen this far down the line with bitcoin. I think That bitcoin is here to stay. It's the benchmark currency. I think that there will be a few Altcoins sharing the throne room though. The world is big enough for more than one currency. In fact it would be stupid to only have one currency. The whole point of cryptocurrency is that it is decentralised and adaptive. It should be malleable like playdough and modular like lego.
Having multiple currencies allows for this and potentially creates less points of failure. A multiple currency ecosystem allows you to turn lead into gold and gold back into lead. There is no point in infighting between solid crypto communities. Sure we should self govern but bashing someone else's innovation makes us no better than the legacy systems we want to supersede.

It uses python so could probably work on windows with some tweaking. I would avoid running it on windows like the plague though. It's insecure, expensive to run and probably riddles with NSA back doors.

OSX is actually built on a flavour of BSD. Aqua, the pretty part is closed source and is actually what you are paying for.
Note I said probably not definitely.
Take into consideration that OpenBazaar runs well on a mac because macs are unix based. Any python app that runs on linux will be easy to install on a mac.
Running python apps on Windows is possible and as I said, this probably would run on windows provided you have python correctly set up and all the correct python modules installed and their paths correctly configured.
When it comes to a commercial deployment of something like this you won't want it on Windows. It would be painful to run.

The joke would still be on us even of we had bought. Lets say we had bought a crap load of it and hodl'd for the ATH. I bet both of us would have cashed out at $10 and thought we had made a mint!
