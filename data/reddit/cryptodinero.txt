BTC was cheaper befor obviously i miss those days as well, But BTC was also only 11cents not very long ago... BTC will continue to grow, it's blockchain is unstoppable. YOu guys shouldn't be dwelling the past but looking ahead,, we are just getting started... think of it this way, if btc was still 240, it would have found it's value then, it would be worth the same..  why isn't a higher value better.? that's all I was getting at.. One day you'll be missing ***these*** good 'ol day's
