3rd gen block chain is the future

Do we think this is because people are now converting their alt gains into btc ?

How do I sync my holdings in Coinbase with my Blockfolio app? Or is there a way to just input the number of btc I have just for tracking purposes?

It sounds like you and your girlfriend deserve each other

Is this a serious post?

Put in what makes you comfortable.
I finally jumped in with what I consider to be a significant amount of fiat when btc hit exactly $15k on 1/3/18. I'm hopeful that I got in just in time for some fun. 
I'll probably be adding a similar amount to Tron when my next deposit hits my coinbase account.

m8, wtf $20k used lambo are you buying?

What people think it is, because it's speculative.  Hence the downward trend.

This is the only reasonable comment in this entire thread.

Practically any business owner I've come across who had any financial sense is doing well for themselves. Hell, even ones that succeed despite their own stupidity can do well short term.
But here we have people thinking their $50k is going to make them a millionaire overnight because it happened to some Russians.

If you own a successful business, then wtf are you doing investing in crypto. You're already gaining equity in a much more broadly accepted and supported format. Leverage that increased equity and keep investing in yourself.
Unpopular opinion, but crypto is for desperate people.

Are you talking classic or modern 911s? Porsche is consistently ranked one of the most reliable brands behind Toyota, Lexus, etc.

I bought at exactly $15k and sold at $14.25k. lost a little bit, but that's okay. Watching the alts now.

Delusional people wanting to feel superior to one of the most influential investors of our time.

Got for a used 911. Worth it!
