Which highlights Bitcoin Cashs marketing scheme. They present Bitcoin Cash as  better” which is immediately validated due to branding / the bitcoin name. 
People are then mislead by Bitcoin.com and  to believe its true. As a result, BCash will have value as long as Bitcoin exists.

Another good one was Bitcoin.com ticker at the top right of the page. It’s supposed to show bch and btc current price.  However, Throughout last year, btc would have a red “down” arrow whenever the markets were down. Bch never showed a down arrow (only up). So when btc is in the red, it gives an impression that one coin is doing better than the other. Crazy manipulation.

It’s always easy to see things as a investor and focus on the metrics, bur if the average person lacks an understanding of these concepts, and honestly wouldn’t give a shit. 
In major cities, During the first few days of tax season, check cashing venues have lines extending outside their doors with people looking to pay 1-3% to cash their tax refund, after spending 20% of the refund just to get it within 24 hours.
The vast majority of the word are not financially savvy, and do not know what opportunity costs are, or look at things to the penny. 
If they see it as “free”, it’s a non issue.

Fees are irrelevant as evident by pay day loans, rapid tax refunds, credit cards, weekly financing, etc. People spend on convenience, and pay fees to do so. Bottom line, the largest crypto user-base in the world with free gains to spend can easily pump some into this gym. They could care less about the fee.

It’s perceived as “free”, since the gains cover all fees + taxes + a year long gym membership.  Does it cost more? Yes. 
Is it used? Absolutely
The same reasons hundreds of thousands of people will pay for “fast refund” tax returns just to get their tax return money in 24 hours, even if it cost 10%.-20%. 
There are reasons to avoid converting to  fiat because it takes days, spouses finding out, mortgage underwriters reviewing bank accounts etc.
