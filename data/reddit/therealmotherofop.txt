The Cola analogy has been the opposite actually. Coca-Cola was originally a medicine in it's "white paper". It evolved over time including changes in that recipe, but it's still Cola-cola.
The way I see it, there is Coca-Cola (BTC) and Coca-Cola light (BCH) (same protocol but with less sugar (fees) at the cost of taste (decentralization). There is no need for the first to be named Coca-Cola Core or whatever. 
And then there are other brands like Pepsi (LTC) or even other soft drinks with DAGs like Fanta (IOTA). 
Not BTC, nor BCH worked out the way envisioned at the start with ASICS, pooled mining, etc. Cola changed as well with the removal of Coca extract and additional of other supplements (Segwit, Lightning). But still remains Coca-Cola as originally outlined in the recipe. Slight improvements has been what made Cola-cola the success it is today.

If Coca-Cola is your analogy I'd rather say Bitcoin is Coca-Cola Regular, and it's forks are just flavors or Light, Zero, Etc. Still in the Coca-Cola brand, but Coca-Cola Light isn't Coca-Cola Regular, it is however still the same brand. If anything, if you want to get brands involved, I'd say their clients are the brands.
Bitcoin core: Coca-Cola Regular (BTC).  
Bitcoin abc: Coca-Cola Light (BCH).  
Bitcoin XT: Pepsi Light (BCH).  
Bitcoin Gold core: Coca-Cola Cherry (BTG).  
And so on. Just my two cents tho, and I agree when I order regular, I don't want light and visa versa. I'm just glad I have a choice in Cola.

Yea i see now that it's from that 365 days guy's blog. Actually I can even take my own point back too by using data even before 2017, where some top 31 alts even died. Interested to see how his portfolio goes in the upcoming years.
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:14:40
Ironically Litecoin is the only one in that list that survived which has exactly the same utility as bitcoin. Alts today have far more different utilities than back in those days. Platformers, DAGS, Privacy coins, Dapp tokens.. something tells me this time is different, but sure many will still die.
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:21:07
Well I'm lucky to be early I guess, since I only put a few hundred bucks in initially. But I wholeheartedly agree "buy the dip" is what will get you there as long as you work besides it. Look at it this way, as long as the price goes up while you buy, everything you already put in goes up. Even if it gets harder to reach that target your initial amount has gone up. Also reminder, never put in more than you can afford to lose, but you probably already know that
@_date: 2018-08-23 06:57:37
I mean, it's also cherry picking the date, alts had an extremely good year in 2017. Moving the starting point earlier would give different results.

To add to the other comments; that Twitter account is a bot which tweets every liquidation on Bitmex. ~~It was on that day BTC jumped 1000$ higher when most people where still bearish (short positions where building up fast) The call it a short sqeeze, and like this liquidation there where lots of people losing millions that day. It was a glorious day on Twitter, the bot went crazy.~~

You're not getting it, each user runs its own "service". Under regulations best they can do is shut down the website where people can download it, which will simply lead to new websites popping up. It's peer to peer in the same sense you use a wallet to facilitate your regular transaction.

Dpends entirely on the fee structure other coins have. Price matters too, but in case of BTC it's the cap and a fee market which is mostly the driving force in fees. Some coins don't have that and will never have sat/b transactions rise, at the cost of decentralization that is though.

Nothing is free, but I understand the point. I'm Dutch so debt culture is very different here I guess
@_date: 2018-06-24 04:05:16
Debt is inheritly loaned money and depending on circumstances money can grow faster than required fee on interest. Example when 10k in debt with only 5% yearly interest, if invested you can beat that 5% yearly and that can be seen as profit over debt.
In case of corporations this goes to the extreme where a brand (and stock) value can grow insanely which makes debt irrelevant. A company can turn loss year after year while still growing and thus building wealth. Pretty common these day, especially when looked into companies like Tesla

Yes but to be clear, box 3 covers wealth capital but only things seen as investments like stocks, second houses, precious metals, crypto and few other things. Actually, for most people most of their wealth/property will be exempted from box 3.

@_date: 2019-01-06 22:09:06
If you mean blocksize *limit* than no. The 32mb BCH is growing far slower in size than 1mb(+segwit so actually 3-4 block*weight*) BTC. Transactions take the same space regardless of the limit, it's not like they can magically compress to fit inside lower limit or expand when there is plenty room. 
Remember the blockchain is just a ledger of transactions, more transactions, bigger size. Optimize the data of those transactions or offload them off-chain than you decrease the rate it grows, limits are just there to prevent making bad use of the available space.

Why? Arguing multiple currencies replacing the limited supply of one is nonsense. As gold, silver or other precious metals all have value overshadowing it's utility (fundamental) value there should be the same intrinsic gap you speak of. If not, and Bitcoin proves supreriority, that will be for the free market to decide.


Written 4 years ago, before alts surged and proven the author wrong. For a Bitcoin maximalist one can even argue the LN works in similar fashion as alts as it works off-chain and changing the innitial consensus system with its own nodes. 


Relative to BTC? Low, however it outperformed BTC which is why i cashed out a bit back to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 11:05:28

Ouch, so crypto as a whole is doomed? Alts will always exist. I've read the article and while interesting it's dated and more importantly **opiniated** 


It is you, who is stuck in bitcoin maximalism. I've been in it and seen those alts, whom I've owned perish. Don't mind it, will always hedge my bets. 


Lol I figured such an answer. It doesn't change consensus on the mainnet but is still on off chain solution running on its own nodes. The argument I'm making here is not that this makes it less bitcoin, it's the similarity to running an alt for micropayments next to bitcoin for store of value. 


Nonsense, it's all speculative. I don't trade for more btc (*just because it's the main trading pair*) because I'm doubtful to bitcoin maximalism. I hold ethereum for ethereum, not to get back to bitcoin.

Not all trading is daytrading you know. Buying at 0.05-0.1btc and selling 0.15-0.2 works pretty well over periods of time, few times a year it seems. 
Then again, that's pretty much periods where other alts do the same when BTC dumps or rallies.
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:48:35
I never mentioned it was without any logical reasoning, it's always with TA, market trending sentimentments and fundamental events included. Last time I bought and sold was due to the fork and bullish sentiments in the overall market. Me mentioning price points was just how it has been historically (no guarantee for the future naturally) and you haven't been paying attention to the market, all alts usually follow a similar path relative to BTC. 
Even then, yes ofcourse trading is part bambling.

Yeah no worries I'm in this a long time but the btc chain split confuses me still.  For one I heard some exchange will handel the split for you automatically and I'm uncertain about the dates. I thought the fork wasn't even going to happen in the first place. I have a nano s ordered but it's not in stock for months but no worries about that either, I have some in my Exodus wallet as well but the coin on the exchanges are currently in alt coins for day trading. 
Edit: for more info, I use haasonline and trade using api's to spread risk of exchanges collapsing (poloniex fears me a bit currently) 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:49:30
Although I mostly agree, it does show there is that much money in accounts ready to be spent. Can be much lower if orders are cancelled but there is definitely strong pressure exercised to push for buy sentiment.

But, nor that the OP say that. One asking for an increase wasn't suggesting to sacrifice security either, saying it would and asking a loaded question whether that was appealing doesn't help. We need a bit of nuance here. Why not even take it a step further and say *we are allready sacrificing security with current limits* and go with Luke 400kb limit? 
Nobody is asking for "gigameg" blocks like the BSV camp, asking for a little increase however is *not* a controversial opinion.

Also that money emoji is fucking cringe

No those are gone for sure

I'm confused, are you saying it's an just a wallet issue (Satoshi won't be aware/won't see additional BTC) or that there are 2 entirely different public keys corresponding to the bugged 50 BTC and the latter transactions?
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:59:02
Genesis address is just a name for the first address, indeed like how some explorers say it. Don't really care about the semantics behind, all that matters is that there is only 1 private key to move something from it. Call it whatever you want though, I just care about it being legitimate proof that only Satoshi can move from it.

They aren't and apparently according to the users above the other 17+ BTC people sent to it are likely lost too since it was wasn't actually the same address.

I figured I'd get this response but the genenis address has *spendable* BTC actually, just not the initial 50 from the mined block. Good thing lots of BTC is on there from people random sending to it.

Allright gotcha, first time I've heard about this. As far as I was aware the p2pk from the initial 50 still had the same private key as the latter p2pkh, despite it being serialized&amp;hashed. Thanks though, I read more into it. Side note, I ran my own blockexplorer from my own node 2 years ago (don't do either anymore) and had similar fuckery and I'm pretty sure other explorers besides blockchaininfo had it too, so what causes this then?

Although top 1000 sounds very high, it is actually not that big.

Which is actually even more amazing, meaning that 10 billion marks still wasn't a rare amount to have (ended with a few trillion mark to the USD dollar) Hyperinflation such an odd thing to witness. Also amazing that even some of today's economies still have it too

Any ATM near Amsterdam? Limburg is just too far away for me to try it out.
