But .. but .. that's where we're posting now.
Oh shit!  We're trapped!  They collapsed the subreddit on top of us!  The whole damned thing was a trap!  [How will we get out!?](

"I don't care ... **but** I'm really upset about it and want to assert my opinion."
She doesn't seem to have the grasp of logic that I would expect from an astrophysicist.

"... pulled in by their friends and acquaintances."
This reminds me of why so many unbacked paper currencies still dominate despite a lack of minerals (no gold standard, etc).  Self-valued slips of paper that are still taken very seriously.  It is because these currencies are backed by nations.
But are nations any more "real" than some paper currency with a self-reported value?  Nations are really just large groups of people who choose to affiliate.  Draw some lines on a map, and declare a group of "buddies".  Friends and acquaintances writ large.
In the end, you want a currency with a user base so large that it won't dry up.  Then there is little fear that you'll later end up with a pocket full of worthless confederate currency.  You also get fewer hassles:  "I need a new power drill.  I wonder if the local hardware store takes [rubles] [visa] [american express] [diners club] [competitors coupons] [bitcoin] [doge] ..."
More friends, more friends of friends, and eventually you start to think "Of course the hardware store takes Doge.  Everyone loves Doge!"
This is why the almighty dollar works:  People are confident in the dollar because other people are confident in the dollar.  That arrangement, too, smells like a pyramid scheme.  But it has been working like crazy for over 200 years.

Yep.  I was wondering why the pumps in the back didn't even have the signs on them.

So Chase's big threat is that you might not have a Chase account if you deal in Bitcoin?  Funny thing about all of this:
I closed my own Chase bank accounts a couple of years ago .. because they suck ass.
Close my Chase account?  [Oh, no!  Don't throw me into that briar patch!](

The way they make their living off of fees is a disgrace.  But don't even get me started about their "upselling" efforts.  OK, now I'm started...
You go in with your account open for years and years, and your deposit slip in hand to do a quick cash deposit.  Then they grab you by the arm, and try to get you to change your account to a "new kind" that lets you win a raffle every month or some such shady gambling-based bullshit.  They strong arm you, and sell-sell-sell.  They won't just let you get to your deposit transaction and get out.  They want to sell you on a new account designed to give you more fees and penalties.
One time, my wife was in the drive-through trying to cash a check right quick.  The chase stooges waved their hands around and mouthed to her from the little window.  They pretended the microphone wasn't working at the drive through.  So she drove around to the front of the bank, and got out of her car fully pregnant.  She trudged up to the bank and went inside to see what the problem was.  Their head thief - er 'manager' - wanted to get her inside so he could talk her into some kind of retirement plan benefit scam.  Yeah, wouldn't let her just have **her** own money that they were holding.  When he got her in, he watched her waddle up super-pregnant (knowing he'd just tricked her out of her car) and started trying to muscle her into a scammy financial transaction.
So, its a bank that seems like a pyramid scheme or other 'con game'.  Every time I walked into that place, it felt like they were trying to sell timeshares to me.  They were slimy as fuck.  Anyone feel good about putting the money your work hard and earn in there?  I sure don't.  I'd rather put the money in a coffee can buried in the back yard.
Honestly, they made me think "Is this a **real** bank?"
I've heard of people [putting "skimmer" devices on ATMs]( or even setting up fake ATMs to steal your card data and PIN.  It made me start to wonder "Is this bank location just a very large version of that?  Maybe they just bought a little building on the corner, and put up a 'CHASE (tm)' sign on the door."
After briefly considering a solution involving violence, we instead opened Credit Union accounts at a CU about 1/2 mile from the Chase bank we'd been using, and the CU has always been the nicest people, with no 'gotcha' fees or scams.

They should send dollars.  That way dollars become associated with , and people abandon dollars for bitcoin.
Somehow I think I'm missing something in my theory.  I'm not sure precisely what it is, but is suspect that it has to do with the idea that if Bitcoin is so fragile that giving it to some guy will "harm" Bitcoin, then there is a much bigger problem here.

Nope, I'm that dude who simply broke up with her, because she's a skank.
In fact, I still have to do a miscellaneous transaction with Chase (HELOC payment), and since they have a manned location inside my local grocer, I do it in person.  Every time I go there, they try to get me to open an account again.

Probably not.
