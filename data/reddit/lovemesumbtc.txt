Where can you trade gift cards for shell gas cards?  I tried at CVS but they don't allow gift card purchases with CVS gift cards.  I think because CVS has that trade in any gift card for store credit program.

Well now that's debatable.  Both babies and BC aren't any fun so it's a risk too many people take.  That's why the earth is pushing like 7 billion people.

If you hold the bitcoin (just like stock) you don't realize gains so you cNt be taxed.  Once you decide to sell your coin (just like stocks) you report the gains and pay taxes.  Simple

It's just really sad how much negative energy you expell that benefits no one including yourself.  I don't want to insult you or start a useless online argument.

@_date: 2014-02-23 21:16:39
The difference is the "use value".  Typical pyramid schemes have no use value just speculative value.  The development of the protocol gives bitcoin use value that increases with more services.  The tulip rush was all speculative and had no potential for actual use, that's why it failed and there's your core difference. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:49:18
I live in the U.S.  And have bought items directly from the U.K. With bitcoin. It was incredibly quick and easy,  my CC info is not floating out there, my bank didn't freeze my account for foreign purchases (which has happened)  and I actually saved a few bucks on conversion rates.  It's also quick and easy to make overstock purchases or target via gift card while still not having to worry about CC info being stolen like it was last year.  It may not be for you but it is certainly quicker easier and leaves me with peace of mind after I make an online purchase.

3% percent is bullshit.  I'm sorry but half of the r/bitcoin previous posts were about bitcoin saving 3%-6 for merchants.  Great I'm sure coinbase charges 1% that makes sense.  Now the merchant saves and the consumer pays 3% extra?  Ok we're going backwards here.

This guy is just an idiot looking for attention.  He doesn't deserve anymore.

I'm relieved they're doing the right thing.  This is the greatest thing since the war on drugs. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:37:28
It's such a cute idea.    :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:13:45
Hmmm so money is embarrassing huh? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:22:37
Lol.  I love reddit
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:46:51
It's off the App Store for a reason.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:36:37
That seems quite interesting. There's always good in everything, you just have to look for it.

Ok. I read the original and updated.  They have a conspiracy to commit murder from the first one due to the PM's and payment received. Aprox. 80,000 USD.  The second one is strictly speculative.  There was 150,000 USD transferred (with nothing to tie this transaction to him).  Law enforcement from this area also had no records of missing persons or founded homicides at this time.  They also checked the said persons name, the address given, and the living situation that was described.  It's all non-existent according to law enforcement records.     Any thoughts??

This guy isn't a shoeshiner ya know?  He could easily memorize addresses and keys I'm sure.  Issue is the potential deals.  I.e. Private key for freedom/wit sec?  Note : This comment is based of off little to no information. Grain of salt.

LolZ.  Look at the drug war.  The greater the fight the more, purer, cheaper drugs arrive.  Maybe the btc fight will bring better programs more expensive btc.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:34:48
Nice.  I didn't know that.  Besides actually seeing it while it was active, any sources?
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:47:24
Lol. Like its gona raise in price through adoption of new systems.  Posts like this are wasted effort. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:43:58
Why do you post here if you hate bitcoin so much?  Every post is quite negative.  There has to be something else out there to waste your time on. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:52:04
I started buying in September which was great.  I did buy a couple coins at around 1000 as well.  I'm waiting very patiently to get back in business.   :)
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:51:33
Agreed and trust me I love me sum BTC
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:30:31
I made a name just to comment this.  You ser did a very good thing regardless of other peoples perceptions.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:35:03
I said before but I don't care.  This guys is negative and is a waste of energy.  Giving IT attention helps no one and is wasted energy.  He deserves no more attention. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:00:52
Aw snap.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:04:50
Done son.  Done.
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:01:37
Perspective!  I have 2 addresses and keys memorized myself.  Granted I do have a good memory comparative to most people I know,  I'm no rainman.   According to another users comments the keys were obtained and funds transferred to a separate wallet.  Seems to be moot anyway. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 21:54:40
Yea it's no problem. Restricted but fine. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:01:36
I'm not trying to raise emotion.  It's all simply too convenient.  It takes an intelligent person to organize what was there.  That same intelligence could not let personal information be disclosed like this.  Unless he was a savant that just didn't think using his real name would lead to anything.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:39:01
There's always a scammer in every system.  These people always fail in the end.  
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:56:28
I'm not willing to make deductions without proper information.  We know the same stuff apparently and most is speculation and opinion from third party sites. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:48:10
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:56:33
Who said he was denying it?  I can't find much information on this case. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:50:08
How much money did you lose hater? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:39:15
Stay positive and spread the good energy.  There's morons and haters everywhere.  It'd be less fun without them ;)
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:49:59
Maybe.  People put faith in the system and good things happen.  Just like every other system in place. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:37:18
Irrelevant to the mood of the post.  He was being facetious. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:43:31
Off topic but yea.  Much more profitable.  If bitcoin goes "to the moon" though.  We'll you know.  Edit: -well

It really is a good story.  Only a story though.  There is literally 0 solid evidence here.  "Unfortunately, we don't have any solid evidences (should we say no evidences at all?) to back up our theory but the timing of the blackmailing, the "arrival" of RealLucyDrop and the story of the rogue partner looks like more than simple coincidences."   This is the most important part of this article.

I don't think he sold drugs. ;)

Lol.  Steve jobs just got off a little bit.

Number 2 most useless comment I've viewed today.   Number 1 is this one.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:48:30
Very strong.  It shyts on 90 world currencies in its current state.
