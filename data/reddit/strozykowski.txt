I thought you could already buy gold with BTC. Isn't it listed as a payment method when you go to purchase?

I have a few ebooks that I'd like to sell here, but I don't see any information specifically for authors.
Should I email the info address, or is there a page that I'm not seeing?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:14:33
I haven't donated before, but I have been meaning to.

I just received my 5 GH/s miner from BFL that I ordered in April, so I agree. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 14:43:24
Can you give us a few more details? 
At 113 what? Antique glass bananas?
What is a whale drop, and what are the consequences?
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:25:26
Not bad, not bad.

Did you just accidentally tip @_date: 2013-10-24 23:04:22
What's it like to have lots of eyes? 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:23:47
Thank you. That's what I needed to hear. Hopefully I'll find out within the next 48 hours.

I put my scrotum on a nuclear reactor for this? 
OK, totally worth it. 
EDIT: Thank you! I promise this is the last time I'll mention the scrotum thing.

I think it's a different chain here in Maryland:

Right up until the standard is killed, and no news is able to move around the country by any means other than paper and radio.
That is...frightening...
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:53:15
To the $10k!
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:24:58
Fair enough. :)

We might even be at the moon by then. Except that the tricky bastard of a moon keeps getting further away...

Vaguely related, but the thought just popped into my head: Theoretically, could the DEA (or other government agency) buy up all of the BTC currently on the trading market and simply "lose" them, and destroy the currency via brute force?

I'd like to donate "A Nice Blanket". Hope it brings some warmth to someone in need!

I'm in the boat of waiting for ACH deposits to be activated for everyone. As soon as that happens, I'm going to be placing a few orders.

What is it like, being a potato?

The only reason I use a fax machine is for financial matters. Dealing with a large national bank for our mortgage, health insurance companies, etc. I'd say they had a pretty big impact on the economy.

Classic potato.

Personally, I want something else.

I'm only 29, *thank you very much*.

You are very welcome! Keep up the great work.

So, I just got this email as well, after initiating a transfer of $100 from Dwolla to Mt. Gox.
The transfer hasn't shown up in my Mt. Gox account yet, but has been deducted from my Dwolla account. Did I just lose $100?
Edit: The funds were successfully deposited into my Mt. Gox account after a normal time lag. So no loss.

Thank you for this, I've been looking for a simple way to sell my ebooks using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:06:10
Maybe a QR code wreath?
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:45:50
It's back up for me, but the message hasn't changed about it being delayed until Nov. 27th.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:14:06
Meh. Needs to look a little more Martian, IMHO.
