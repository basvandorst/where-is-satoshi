You're absolutely right but there also is luck that BTC wasn't overtaken by some alt, wasn't shown to have a 50% attack, wasn't found to have an easy double-spend bug, yada yada yada. Investing in technology early always comes with a huge amount of risk.  The people that invested in Iomega in 1994 made huge gains until they suddenly didn't.  No matter how much you believe in Bitcoin as a force to change the world financial systems there are tons of ways it could fail or at least fail to mewn. 
  
It's really important to be cognizant of risk when investing.  There are a lot of people in this sub who just like the smell of their own farts.  Maybe they'll have the last laugh, maybe not.  If they're really smart they're already identifying what the *next* big thing is so they can get in early.  If they can't do that then I'd say it's safe to say they're lucky more than wise.

If you haven’t been reading the stories about Bitfinex and the allegations of BTC price manipulation I don’t know what to tell you.  Maybe everything is on the up-and-up. But if Tether explodes it may became glaringly obvious how they are connected.  [This article]( is a pretty good overview of the situation today.
  
If those guys are printing coins for free, and then using them as if they are worth $1 each to buy BTC then that’s a lot of demand pushing price up.  If tether collapse and that demand goes away (and also a lot of BTC moves to cover losses) that could be a near apocalyptic event for BTC.

Yep, that is an easy, pat answer that ignores the actual meat of the argument.  You can't have it both ways.
  
People in this sub HODL and don't dare sell because they want it to mewn.  I know this because the "I'm not selling" meme is posted like every other day here.  But that same hodl logic means hodlers are loath to use their hoard as an actual currency - why spend your sats on a sandwich today if you think those sats will buy two sandwiches tomorrow?
  
So the current situation is all the hodlers staring nervously at one another constricting the supply (keeping prices up) hoping that enough new capital enters the system to allow them to cash out and lambo.  This does not drive adoption as a currency.  Hodlers will only succeed if they can attract enough new capital or print enough Tether to keep buy demand high.  If that fails then the hodlers will get rekt.

There was a lot of luck involved in your bet turning out to be a winning one. The most glaring of which was the possibility that an exploit could have been discovered. People believed in madoff, Enron, mt gox, quadrigacx, and a variety of altcoins and look where that got them. Congrats for jumping on the opportunity but there was still a lot of luck involved.

No it's not "from my point of view".  Random chance is a huge factor in investing and in life.  I bought a house in 2001 and sold in 2005 and made a six-figure profit from the sale.  Was I an investing genius, or did I get lucky?

You’re misunderstanding. OP means when 1 BTC=$3700 not when you finally scraped up $3700 babysitting.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:23:50
The case for bitcoin is schizophrenic.  On the one hand everyone here wants to HODL until mewn because BTC is an asset whose value may appreciate, like gold.  On the other hand it's a currency that desperately needs people to use it in order to demonstrate its worth and appreciate in value.
  
So far there is very little of the latter going on, and US tax law very much treat BTC like the former, which certainly puts a crimp into the latter.

Ten cents a pound is pretty cheap in the Midwest for pretty boulders (e.g. Mossy Arkansas boulders).  It's not hard to pay 15 or 20 cents a pound for really desirable boulders.  Smooth granite boulders for instance are beautiful but really expensive.  They tend to be &gt;10 cents a pound and since granite is really dense and heavy they weigh a lot, driving to cost up even more...
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:52:54
That may be true but it is also irrelevant...
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:20:22
Why do you have to be so confrontational and angry? My point is exactly the same as yours. 
 Landscaping is not just wasted money; a well-landscaped place can sell for like 10% more than the same place with no landscaping. I mentioned it because it is the most recent project I did and as home improvement projects go it's pretty modest. And it *still* cost like a third of that guys's savings.  
I've has to replace furnace and A/C and other shit too, and that stuff easily runs into five figures.  Buying a house when you have less than 10k saved sounds dangerous to me because you'll probably barely be able to keep up with maintenance let alone do much in the way of improvement, especially once you figure in other stuff in life beyond home ownership expenses.
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:02:39

Admittedly a lot of boulders, but at 200/ton it adds up fast.  It's not hard at all to spend 500 on plants at a nursery. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:56:57
The typical rule-of-thumb is that home maintenance will cost ~1-2% of it's value per year.  Admittedly this is "bursty", you may need nothing for two years and then need a new driveway for $10,000. Neglecting upkeep ("deferred maintenance") will eventually depress the value of a house.
@_date: 2014-07-17 01:39:07
Yes, this. So much this. I just planted a nice flower garden under some trees out front. North of $1000 for some nice boulders, probably $500 worth of plants and $300 for mulch. $100 or so for sprinkler / irrigation parts. And this was a somewhat modest project.
  
Houses are expensive.

Take a step back and re-read what you wrote. Stripping away the inflammatory crackpot nonsense, your first claim is that bitcoin is a currency, not an asset. People are fools if they treat it as an asset. Okay, got it.
  
But then you also claim the right thing to do is *hold it* and not trade it. Which means you are advocating speculating on bitcoin as an asset, not using it as a currency.

You can easily just buy crypto yourself from the dollars they pay you. Oh but then your clients might send you a 1099 and you’d have to pay *taxes* on that income. That would be inconvenient for you.
  
Rule  of business: make it easy for your customers to pay you. Acquiring and selling BTC has tax implications so you’re asking your customers to deal with that headache for...what value exactly? And then when they do go to send you a 1099 I’m not even sure how they’d calculate it if the transactions were denominated in crypto. If some contractor tried to pull that with me I’d say “no thanks” and find another that would work on *my* terms.
  
Your customers are not the ones behaving like idiots here.

If you owned bitcoin and converted it to another asset class (primarily other cryptocurrencies or dollars) then you are subject to **capital gains** taxes. If you can prove you bought for $100 and you sold for $200 then you owe on the $100 asset appreciation of that bitcoin.  If you can’t prove how you bought it you owe taxes on the full $200.

No I’m not disputing that. The supply of bitcoin is clearly algorithmic in nature. What I am disputing is that the *value* of bitcoin is anything like “algorithmic”.   Over the long term it has grown but over short to medium timescales it is wildly volatile. 
  
Personally I’m not convinced the “halvening” is going to cause value to increase.  I guess we will see.

Why would it be in a small business’s best interest to accept BTC? Name one product or service that you think would have a stable price in BTC? Tax laws would make transacting in BTC a PITA, one security slip-up and the funds are gone, and oh yeah, how long are you willing to wait around for the transaction to clear?  The value of any held BTC will swing dramatically overnight, so how would the business do forecasting, or pay its vendors (who do not accept BTC) Now explain how a business will see enough growth in revenue and profit from accepting BTC to justify the extra expense and hassle of dealing with it.

The term you want is "forex". Bitcoin is a currency similar to USD or the Euro. Most people here want to make money via speculation. If you believe Bitcoin will be worth more in the future then you could buy now and hope to trade back to USD (or Euro or whatever currency you prefer) on better terms in the future. This has been extremely lucrative for some but it is also extremely risky.  
  
You could try to make money via arbitrage by converting between currencies in a way such that you sell on better terms than you buy.

Wow! Your passion is admirable. The passion of a true believer.  Lots of things that seemed promising and were supported by a crowd of true believers did ultimately fail though. Lots of time the first iteration of a technology was not the one that ultimately succeeded. The best technical solution does not always win.
  
Crypto will find a place but I don’t think BTC is likely to be what you envision.  It’s clearly vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. It requires unreasonable disciple to secure. Every other day there’s a Quadriga-esque story of SFYL. The world is coming around to the idea that blockchain itself, while clever, is maybe not actually very useful.  Even moreso for bitcoin’s proof-of-work. I personally don’t think Bitcoin’s reputation is very good among “the masses” and the volatility on display here doesn’t help. Volatility is not a sign of strength it’s the sign of a weak, thinly-traded market.  When the US stock markets dipped last October I watched BTC carefully and didn’t see ant sign of anti-correlation — nobody was moving their money to BTC for safety.  I don’t see high-school-age kids using it and they are exactly the demographic BTC needs to reach to drive mass adoption.
You mention the Yellowstone Caldera - I think there is still huge risk of a “black swan” event dealing BTC a fatal blow or least driving the price back to the Silk Road days. (I think we can both agree that BTC &lt; $250 would be basically the same thing as “zero”). A security vulnerability in the protocol or in a popular client. A really spectacular large-scale rip-off a la Quadriga or Mt Gox. A successful 51% attack. A successful piece of malware (hardware or software). The risk of these things may be low but the risk is not zero and the consequences would be devastating. 
  
Maybe BTC will mewn. But I can’t look at the evidence and see that as very likely. I’m sure you’ve got arguments at the ready to attack me some more for being ignorant and stupid. But as you feel that rage rising up in yourself you might stop and consider if it’s really *me* whose judgment is being clouded by emotion here. Crypto is a fun place to play but I hope you don’t have all your money in the BTC basket.  Diversity wins in the long run.

There is absolutely no fundamental reason for FB to base their credit system on crypto *per se*. What they are proposing is not that much different from, say, frequent flyer miles. You don’t need crypto for that. Crypto’s advantage is supposed to be how egalitarian and decentralized it is. That’s the opposite of what FB and Uber want. They just want a bigger bite of the banking system. 
  
And personally, yes, I do thing crypto is headed for a reckoning. I don’t think it’s demonstrated enough value yet, and I think the price shenanigans are due to massive manipulation. I don’t think it is headed for *zero* but I am personally negative on the long-term outlook and I think hodlers are more likely to get burned than they are to get lambos.

This is nonsense. No one said that. You might have said that about the World Wide Web when it exploded in 1994 but there was no skepticism about the Internet itself. The parallel is weak at best. The Internet spent its first 20 years being built and funded by universities and the Federal Government. Applications and protocols came and went (Archie, Veronica, gopher, Usenet) but I don’t remember anyone ever predicting the Internet would collapse, especially once the WWW took it mainstream. The Internet was delivering lots of value even before it.
  
If you want to make that argument I’d say BTC and /or Blockchain are still in the early stage. The “www” equivalent that will cause it to explode has not yet been created, and it’s debatable if blockchain is delivering any real value to anyone besides speculators right now.

Maybe.  Every successive halvening will have a smaller impact on price than the ones before it.
In the beginning there were few coins available so most transactions involved newly-mined coins.  A halvening at that time is a big deal because it squeezes the [growth of the] total supply. If there are 10000 total coins and 1000 per month are being mined the market will notice when the mining stream falls to 500. That’s a pretty big event,
  
But now most coins have been mined.  If you want to buy BTC there is a plentiful supply. As the stream of coins being mined slows to a trickle it ceases to have much effect on supply and therefore price.  If there are ten million coins and miners are producing 100 per month will anyone notice if it falls to 50 per month?
  
I think the halvening is going to put the hurt on miners. Remember they are eventually supposed to subsist on transaction fees alone.  The question that would keep me awake at night is “Will it ever be possible to profitably mine BTC from transaction fees alone?”
  
Transaction fees can’t just skyrocket after all - one of the supposed benefits of BTC is how cheap it is.  If it gets too expensive to move people trying to use it for commerce will abandon it. If miners en masse decide mining BTC is unprofitable then BTC becomes useless and the price will crash.
  
I don’t see how this death spiral can be avoided.

You came and posted a question about future price movement and now you’re saying it’s very easy to use TA to predict future price movements. If TA is foolproof then just trade on it and you’ll soon be rich, right?
  
The reason TA is bullshit is because it commits the fallacy of using past performance to predict the future. Like using the martingale system to bet on roulette. Works, until it doesn’t.
  
Think about how turbulent the crypto landscape is.  Tomorrow a big institution might make an announcement that drives the price up. A security flaw or bad press might drive the price down. Nations may embrace it or outlaw it. A whale might decide he wants to convert a billion in BTC into real estate. Who knows?  These and literally billions of other random events drive the price.  Technical analysis “support” and “resistance” means nothing in the face of that randomness. It works until it doesn’t. Just look up “BTC” every day on Google.  Every day you’ll see stories from rags like cointelegraph saying that BTC is “poised for a breakout” or “in a bear trap” (or a “Bart”) or whatever. Pay attention to how often those stories are right and how often they miss by a mile. 
  
I’m pretty sure far more computing power has been invested in trying to predict movement in equities than has been spent mining BTC and the best advice is still to buy into an index and hodl for decades.
  
But it will be easy to prove me wrong. Use TA to get really rich and then come laugh in my face.  Good luck!

Bitcoin would collapse under the load. How many TPS can it support? How quickly would the blockchain grow? How long would people have to wait for transactions to clear when they want to buy gas or a sandwich? How much would be outright stolen when you try to teach an entire country to safely store and manage coins? The country is going to wind up setting up a centralized exchange. And bitcoin is volatile as all fuck so how will the country manage imports and exports? How do price exports when BTC regularly moves tens of percent against stable currencies monthly. BTC spiking up would be devastating to exporters and BTC crashing would be devastating to importers.
How will the country even acquire sufficient BTC for liquidity - even a small country will need billions. Buy it on the open market?  With what?
   
Who wins in this scenario? Not the government and not the people, as near as I can tell.  If a government wanted to go crypto they’d have to start fresh with something they could issue and control in a reasonable manner.

But they have no incentive to stay in the game unless there appears to be years of growth ahead of them.  If the difficulty is going down doesn’t that suggest BTC usage is shrinking?  Remember that miners eventually have to make all their money from fees alone. No transactions, no fees.

What happens if the cost of electricity and the lack of transactions means *no* miners can make enough money to justify the capital and operating expenses need to run mining rigs?

It has to be profitable enough that investors would rather put their money there than say, opening an Arby’s or buying boring old stocks.

I don’t see it. The whole point of the halving is to transition miners to getting most of their income from transaction fees instead of the mining reward.  Given that a large percentage of coins haven’t moved in a few years and given that transaction volumes have hard time staying above 350k transactions per day, I am skeptical that transaction fees will be enough to keep the miners in the black.  So I don’t personally think it is sustainable long-term. And I think every halving is just hastening the collapse.

Agreed.  Proves and facts are important.  Its been ten years and I am not seeing any natural uptake of BTC outside of speculators.  The fact that is not shooting up when other markets are down leads me to think no one really trusts it as a deflationary value store. Tax law in at least the US makes it a pain to use or trade.
  
I think it has a few use cases and will bounce around but I don’t think there will be enough to support a valuation of thousands per coin. And that’s not to mention the risk of a Black Swan event like a vulnerability being discovered that allows double spending, or another mt gox or a successful 51% attack.  I don’t think it will go to zero (there will always be some enthusiasts playing with it) but I don’t think it is destined to be an everyday part of billions of people’s lives.

Oh Lordy Lordy. Have you missed all the stories of people losing BTC due to malware or hacked wallets?  Keeping my money (or worse, my customers money) in a place where it can stolen by anyone worldwide if I make the slightest misstep (or if a new vulnerability is discovered) leaving me with zero recourse is the opposite of good business sense. It’s a good way to go bankrupt literally overnight. Who’s going to give a loan to a business with that kind of exposure? 
   
I agree BTC needs adoption for success. It has to start somewhere. Point me to *any* good or service primarily priced in BTC.  I can think of one: BTC mining, which is intrinsically based in BTC, not fiat. If adoption is going to spread there needs to be more.  BTC is not *that* new and a ton of money and effort has been sunk into it. Outside of “hodl and wait for mewn” what utility is it providing?  I just am not seeing it.
  
Email is an interesting choice because of the other parallel to BTC: nobody runs their own email servers. Sure, back in the day you might but if you’re a small company you are not going to set up and maintain an email domain and SMTP server. Who wants to manage that? You’ll use Gmail or something provided by your third-party web-hosting provider.

The only native BTC economy right now is mining BTC. The only real use case I see for it is moving money around the world quickly while avoiding the traditional financial system.  But governments are getting wise to that so that utility will diminish as they find ways to regulate it. Then what are you left with?   I predict two things happen within the next five years.  1) a “black swan” event that brings about a crisis of confidence 2) BTC prices fall to the $50 range.  
  
I think mining’s profitability will decline, miners will start to leave, transactions will take longer to go through, repeat — all the way to 50 bucks per coin. 
   
And finally there’s a chance that a different crypto will emerge that is clearly superior to BTC in some way and drive BTC to zero in a matter of months. That would be one possible black swan that could arise unpredictability.

The idea of the credit card was an entirely new concept built around a high-tech core. It got adoption much faster than “generations”.  Ditto PayPal.  Without adoption BTC is just a curiosity.  I don’t doubt we may see digital currency become a thing but I do doubt BTC will be it. I see zero signs of adoption growing, but I do see signs of decline.
  
Honestly a lot of the recent posting on this sub (you included) resembles nothing more than the discussion on forums related to the (revolutionary) EmDrive, or the (revolutionary fusion device) eCat. There’s always a group of dogmatic core believers that hang on after the writing is on the wall. Sometimes they ultimately triumph...but not very often.
  
I hope I’m wrong and you are insulting me from your Lamborghini next year.  But I see very little reason to think BTC is going to bounce back except for the fact that a few people have large amounts of money in it and would do anything to keep it from going to zero.  Then again, hedge-fund investors routinely see their investments go to zero, so maybe they’re already writing it off.

If what you say is true then I would expect stock market dips to correspond to spikes upward in BTC as people “flee to quality”. Instead it seems that bad days on Wall Street are bad or even worse days for BTC. If the economy implodes the nobody will give a shit about BTC. They’ll be too busy dealing with real problems.

If the answer is “ no” then they’re not *really* a BTC native economy are they? Especially if they take BTC and then immediately turn it back into fiat.

Instinct. BTC isn’t my first investment rodeo. It’s failing as a currency. Hashrates crashing. 51% attacks may be possible soon. Incredibly easy to have your coins stolen. Uses far too much energy to scale. Even it’s backers are now calling it a “store of value” instead of a currency. Institutional investors likely to dump it.  Its reputation as something that “criminals use” actually sorta growing true.
  
Personally I think it goes to zero within five years.

How exactly can any price correct downward “over 100%”? “Down 100%” means “Price goes to zero”.

I don’t know where you get this idea. Visa and mastercard went from zero to successful in less than a decade. PayPal was successful in much less than a decade. The Euro was successful in far less than a decade.

I think it's much more likely to got to $250 for awhile and then fall to $40.  I'll predict that a year from today BTC trades in $40-250 range.

I doubt the IRS gives a fuck about your .2 BTC holdings but if you cash out hundreds of thousands in profits then you better fess up or live in terror for the next seven years.

You are quite wrong.  The US treats BTC as an asset and not a currency. You can “insist” all you want but that won’t help you when the tax man comes calling you.  Maybe you would be able to hide it and get away with it but I thought BTC was supposed to have a use for non-criminal actions.  If you buy a car for euros *and then sell it for a profit* there’s a good chance you will need pay a capital gains tax.

difficulty drops -&gt; people with bitcoin start mining
  
Maybe. This is only true if the profit of bitcoin mining &gt; profit doing other stuff with the same capital.  I think falling stock markets will [ironically] test that. Suppose the S&amp;P and Dow go into heavy recession and go 40% off their peaks. You have a bunch of capital to invest and a long-term horizon (say, 20years). Which seems like the better use of capital: buying equities when they’re priced at low P/E ratios or investing in crypto-mining? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:15:12
And why will it?  I don’t see any use case for it right now that’s not either criminal or kind of crazy.  And I say this as someone who was really interested five years ago. Right now all I see happening in crypto is a huge zero-sum circle jerk of speculators selling to each other, scamming each other, or outright stealing from each other. 
  
Can you point me to any legitimate commerce that’s actually being conducted using BTC as a primary currency? It’s been ten years, surely it’s thriving somewhere by now? Without legitimate commerce what’s going to drive adoption?
@_date: 2018-12-27 14:20:30
Short term you’re absolutely right. But the HODLers on this sub tell me to look out a long way. One of them even said it would take “generations” for BTC to mature. It won’t take more that what, a year of unprofitability for miners to give up, write down losses, and find something else to do. Let’s be generous and say two years. Not a long time on any investment scale.

Honestly if you moved $50k worth of BTC around and made multiple trades then hire a flippin’ CPA.  But first do some basic googling like “crypto taxes USA”.  I am not an accountant but I am an anonymous person on the Internet so the value of my advice should be obvious.
  
There is a critical bit of information missing in your post, namely what the BTC was worth when you converted it to alts. **Trading crypto to crypto is a taxable event**. If you bought at 5k and held until BTC rose to 10k and then traded for alts then you owe taxes on 50k in capital gains. If however BTC fell to 3k before you bought alts then you have a realized loss of $20k dirty fiat. If you traded into alts while the BTC was worth about 5k the tax implications will be minor because the gain or loss will be small. 
  
There are short- versus long-term tax implications depending when you first bought that 50k worth of BTC and on how you can write of losses against your other income taxes, but that’s why you need a CPA. 
  
If you are sitting on a basket of [alarmingly shrinking] altcoins there is no tax event until you sell, trade, or spend them. HODLing does not generate taxable events. Remember how posters like to say “if you don’t sell you haven’t lost”? You can sell or spend the alts and write down the loss or HODL and pay long-term capital gains when those alts turn around and mewn next year. Which will definitely happen.

That hurts, coming from you. Not so much because you post drivel like this [this]( as the fact that you’re using Blue Thunder in your username. I loved that movie as a kid and watched the TV series religiously.  Although looking at it now, blue thunder seems like a symbol of overpowered centralized authority. I don’t think city cops should use that kind destructive firepower on civilians, do you?
  
Also the movie came out in ‘83. Not sure why you used ‘85.

I disagree that this is workable. Even giant corporations with huge resources are moving computing to the cloud (Amazon, Azure, Google) as fast as they can because managing servers is awful.  In other words, centralization.  Who’s going to insure these businesses against loss and liability? Nobody, unless the businesses operate under stringent guidelines in how they manage their nodes. Think PCI DSS, only moreso.  
  
Managing payment processing is generally awful. If my choice is between running my business and outsourcing payment processing or spending all my time managing some wacky software that has to run all the time costing me money even when I’m not doing business I’m not going the BTC route. I’m outsourcing it to Chase and getting on with my life. 
  
Sure some bitcoin speculators got rich, but can you show me any business that has found BTC to be central to their success? Any business that is not directly involved in BTC (e.g. not miners, exchanges, ICOs, etc).

So suppose you set up a wallet and BTC succeeded so now your wallet holds BTC that could be traded for $10million in fiat. You store it in a paper wallet. Your neighbor visits your house, sees the wallet and takes a photo of it, then goes home and transfers that BTC to a wallet he controls. He “moved” the “ownership”. In your terms. The next day you see him in his new Lamborghini.
By your logic I am not sure he did anything wrong. The bitcoin network doesn’t care. I bet you do though. Are you you going to engage the legal system to sue him? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 06:03:00
Bitcoin’s relation to the USD is not really a great metric, is it?  I mean right away you’re framing the discussion in terms of speculation and not utility.  
  
If BTC is to succeed as a currency only one thing matters: **adoption**. How many transactions is the network processing? How viable is it for day-to-day use? It will be a success when there are products **natively priced in btc**. Right now there are no real-world products or services that have a predictable, stable price in BTC.  If that emerges then BTC will be a success.  If there’s a simple, clear, and convincing use case where BTC is better because of practical reasons outside of  “teh evil government fiat” or “hodl because you’ll see”. Right now that is sorely missing. 
  
I think we can consider BTC a failure if “real” transactions decline over an extended period. (I say real because raw transaction numbers are too easily manipulated). It’s a failure if the number of miners declines over an extended period.  If it turns out that it really is mostly used for pump-and-dumps and money laundering. Then it may find it’s niche but it will just be small-time, and there’s no reason for coins to cost more than like, 40 bucks.
  
And in my opinion it will never succeed as long as we hear stories *every week* of people being swindled due to corruption, collusion, weak passphrases or any other security weakness.  The fact that a) there are no products or services “natively” traded in BTC and b) there is a VERY LARGE AND SERIOUS RISK that you will lose your coins if you make the tiniest misstep (or even though no fault of your own) makes it hard to recommend.  
  
And finally  there is still the possibility of a “DAO attack writ large” emerging. A global seismic disruption so severe it fatally damages the world’s trust in the integrity of the whole system. This could be a mining bug, a successful 51% attack, discovery of a way to double-spend, a monstrous botnet attack or even just good old-fashioned market manipulation. Sure the probability is small, but not that small.  I’d say there’s a good 50% chance of a major integrity-test within the next five years. If BTC faces such a test and recovers then it may gain enough trust to succeed.  But having living among tech since the mid-80s, I’m not optimistic.

I just found out that *spending* BTC (on goods and services) has capital gains tax implications in the US.  How can anyone expect adoption [as a currency] to grow if users have to deal with capital gains taxes on every single transaction?

Maybe I’m not intelligent. What I see is technology that is hard to use, easy to get stolen, uses way too much power and can never scale. I think you’ll see sub-2k within the next year. Sub 1k more likely that anything over 7k within their year, in my stupid opinion.

Let’s say there is a huge liquidity crisis in the banking system next year. People by the tens of millions look to crypto to be their savior. What confidence do you have that the BTC network could cope with the resulting transaction volume? Followed shortly by people forgetting pass phrases by the tens of millions, getting swindled and hacked by the tens of millions. Accidentally sending funds to the wrong wallets by the tens of millions.
  
Sure, prices would theoretically skyrocket in the panic but the whole system would seize up, Congress would call for investigations, it would be an absolute disaster. In such a situation hodlers who suddenly find themselves with BTC holdings worth $100MM on paper are going to be in for a rude awakening. 
  
All my opinion, of course.  /tips fedora

But if stocks go down then the potential upside at recovery goes up, making them more attractive, especially if interest rates are low. Bitcoin is far too volatile to take seriously as a “flight to quality” and there’s still a risk that a bug in the protocol or clever malicious code sends the whole thing to zero.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:02:52
We agree on the concept, just not the terminology.  "Holding debt" generally means "loaning money".  If you buy a car and have a loan you are *in* debt but the bank is *holding* the debt.  
  
gnaritas already knows the following as do most redditors probably but:
  
You (the debtor) would love to see a huge inflation spike right after you sign the papers because then you could pay back your debt in cheaper dollars.  My mom's mortgage is a good example: When she started paying $400/month it was a big expenditure but 25 years later when she was making $80 that was a laughably small mortgage payment. You can see this in reverse in lottery payouts.  If you win $1million payable over 20 years at $50k a year the net present value (e.g. "cash payout") will be a lot smaller because expected inflation is taken into account - $50k 20 years from now will probably buy a lot less than 50k right now.

The person "holding the debt" *is* the person loaning the money.
  
Mild price inflation is good for economies because it encourages economic activity - buy now rather than later becauses prices are going up. Deflation has the opposite effect - why buy now when your dollar will buy more goods next year? This can really hurt an economy, which we saw when housing went into the shitter.  Why buy a house now for $200,000 when you can buy it in six months for $120,000?
