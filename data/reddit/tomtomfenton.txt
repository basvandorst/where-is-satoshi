I would try comparing with nitrogen and direct bet, I think that they are pretty big, don't know about the rates though. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:20:53
Well, once I tried and they paid, so go for it! :)

how come? does the trust in US dollar revolves around it's creator? or maybe euro? peso? yen? 
Bitcoin is not a small nerd project anymore, there is not one thing that can change "everything", especially not something as worthless as the identity of it's creator 
@_date: 2015-12-09 13:46:12
I'm a 5 year old with broad interest in cryptocurrency. Deal with it. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:22:08
and how does his identity changes anything here? there is the creator, with a lot of bitcoin and can change a lot on the market but who he actually is seems completely irrelevant  
@_date: 2017-02-20 14:30:18
It's a trap! 
@_date: 2016-01-11 15:18:50
As someone said earlier: don't think about it, just do it! It's the best way to learn what people like or don't. And it will be the best evaluation of your idea possible. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:51:22
Why not? It's possible 
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:49:50
That's awesome that he manages to do that but it also shows that we'll have to wait for some more years for Bitcoin to became real easy and acceptable to use. Especially when you realise that US is a small fraction of the world which has a lot smaller implementation and awareness of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:49:58
And I'd say you are very wrong. The world is getting rid of paper money switching to electronic transfers. Maybe it's not easy to see in the US but Europe starts to forget how paper money works. There are even talks about getting rid of it once and for all in a few countries as well as in EU. 
So it's a matter of time. 
And Bitcoin as digital only currency will stay just that.

Nice one! 
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:43:14
How can you ban Bitcoin?

Great article!
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:37:24
Nice graphics etc, but it doesn't explain much about blockchain 
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:04:00
Yes. I'm using them for a very long time.

To the moon bitchachos!

If i were a ceo of Russia's largest bank i will have a lot of BTC, 
@_date: 2016-11-21 09:38:59
But Satoshi is against using bitcoins by WikiLeaks, right?
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:03:15
That's nice. Congrats OneHash!
@_date: 2016-11-10 12:59:17
@_date: 2016-11-10 12:59:06
Could someone please explain it in simple words? 
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:18:35
How cool is that?! 
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:07:48
I placed a bet on Trump, bet I hope he will not win. I just did to have just a small benefit from this disaster ... 
@_date: 2016-11-07 15:03:23
@_date: 2016-11-22 13:47:13
What is the maximum? 21?
@_date: 2016-11-10 16:19:44
Can't we do both? 
@_date: 2016-11-21 09:39:14

@_date: 2015-07-27 15:58:30
Good question - anybody else used this site?
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:51:51
Maybe leave it somewhere else? 
@_date: 2016-02-01 12:48:47
Thank you for that! 
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:06:35
Totally agree, Argentina is 100 % winner! I will think about it. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:11:29
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:50:25
What do you mean by format? I think the format is the same everywhere, if your bet is 0.01 BTC and final multiplier on onehash is 3.00  (and you win) you get 0,01 x 3.00

You are sponsoring a e-sport team or you are playing with your friends?
@_date: 2016-10-10 09:30:04
