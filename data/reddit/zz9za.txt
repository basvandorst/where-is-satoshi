Congratulations, you've reinvented the legacy payment system, inefficiently.

Geez, bitcoiners lying to seem more popular than they really are, that's NEVER happened before.
@_date: 2015-06-07 19:51:47
No, it isn't a killer app because time and time again consumers have shown that they fucking hate fucking micropayments.
They either want free, usually ad-supported content, because, well, FREE, or they want to pay a flat fee for access to everything (netflix model), because then a bit of relaxing content consumption doesn't turn into an economic dilemma of "Do I really want to spend 10 cents to see this?"

You understand the giftcards useds to make the purchase were likely stolen, right?

It's a completely HORRIBLE way to buy BTC.

Yea as a buyer I'm noping out of that faster than a craigslist deal in a dark alley.

Lol. Bitcoin would fail so massively at a big festival like that. Even completely ignoring confirmation time, the entire buffoon network could support 1.2 transactiona a day per attendee. That's with NO other traffic. BTC is so far from useful.
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:33:40
Umm no. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:11:37
Medium to high vilune merchants can do WAY better than stripe rates.
@_date: 2015-06-25 22:29:45
Why? No one can us going to shop somewhere with a more annoying payment method with no chargebacks to get a 1% discount. Any more than that and the merchant saves nothing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 04:38:56
No you can't. You can send an equivalent amount in bitcoin, but you're absolutely not sending "dollars". Just hand-waving away forex fees/exchange rate spreads does not an honest argument make.
@_date: 2015-06-10 02:40:33
For one obvious reason, most of the races are either in the Euro zone, or in places where the dollar is *at least* as welcome as the actual local currency.

Try harder. The Target debit card you mentioned has a *22.9%* APR.

No, you're in this situation because you were speculating with money you couldn't afford to lose.

Given history, I don't trust that. Way too much co-mingling of ownership. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:25:43
Further confirming my initial reaction. For a sensative platform you should really be using something with a smaller attack surface like nginx.
@_date: 2014-12-08 21:49:14

When you are acting as essentially a bank, you should have a commiserate security budget.

Yes, it is. Typical bitcoiner to the moon hype circlejerking
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:53:24
To prop up their investment and make it appear as if Bitcoin is far more economically relevant than it really is?
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:25:24
It doesn't even mean THAT. Anyone who's bored and controls a large number of BTC could massively inflate the daily volume at almost no cost.
Sent 1000 BTC for addredd A to address B, both self-controlled, then from B to A, etc.

LOL. You obviously don't understand the economics of mining. At best mining is a theoretical break-even. Then the mining company gets a cut. That's ignoring variance. 
Would you make a dollar bet to flip a fair coin, where if you win you get $1.50? That's the position you're taking.

Because solar is only actually useful for MAX about 14  hours a day - and that's assuming clear skys. If it's cloudy, output it cut. If it's overcast, foggy or rainy, output is zero.

This is likely not true. How good are your metrics? Do you know what percentage of customers bail on the payment page? Have you A/B tested the checkout page with and without the BTC option? There have been many UX studies showing that simpler / less option checkouts convert better.
