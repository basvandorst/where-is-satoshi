Yeah, the Japanophile-thing is not very compelling, 3 out of 10 people who are into computers, seem to be fans of Japan culture. It's just growing up with Nintendo and Manga/Anime. Cypherpunk definitely shows roots in early hacker culture but there's a number of people who were on the mailing list(s). I don't think being able to write C++ code is telling at all.
I think if he really holds that many bitcoins, that is a definitive factor that adds weight to the story though. I think, this is the best case that has been made till now, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.

I'd say this one has been the first time a case has been made in a plausible way with enough skepticism presented. Unlike the Newsweek story for example.
But I'd disagree that this is either him or Kleinman. I think the BTC protocol is very well designed but this whole talk about having to be a genius to invent it, is a little bit exaggerated. If one would take 1 to 2 years of actual work, it wouldn't be crazy to come up with this and write a compelling paper as well.
Satoshi Nakamoto could still be anyone else. But I agree with you, I think Kleinman was a good candidate, and this guy doesn't seem totally off either.

He's 12 years old and he's gotta catch them (the bitcoins) all.

Dr. Adam Szabo-Wright to you, Sir.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:07:02
Yeah, I felt a little like that as well. This article also added a little merit to it: 
Whether he is Nakamoto or not, I have little doubt that Wright leaked that information himself.

They didn't say it's absolutely true. They actually acknowledged that it might be a hoax. The rebuttal here is also not addressing all necessary points. Which is not to say that I believe Mr. Wright is behind the pseudonym. I doubt it.

Can you give me the link?
(sorry, here it is:  )

Y'all act like you never seen an anonymous person before,
Coins all on the floor like Newsweek just burst in the door

I find it odd that he seemed to have edited and added trails after 2009.

Calm down.

Well, whether or not the e-mail is really from him/her/them, it shows that the idea can't be based on his writings alone. That would only lead to a whole "the scripture"/"the founding fathers" said-situation which is not level-headed or rational.

It doesn't help if Bitcoin gets so complicated that people without much technical knowledge need to "Find out which Bitcoin is right for you!".

I'm sorry about your grandfather. And I think it's good to make ethical decisions like that, to be on top of the power of money.
