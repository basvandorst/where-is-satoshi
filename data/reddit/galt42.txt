However, detecting the Bitcoin code being transferred and arresting the sender could be enforceable.

He was an ASSet alright.

You're welcome to that opinion, but remember this day some years from now *after* the government is involved, and know that their involvement in why Bitcoin "just isn't like it was in the good ol' days".
I promise, if the government starts tinkering, this is exactly what will happen.

I am.

Aww... That's cute.

You mean the actual name?
Like, *Bit* coin? The coin of bits? As in single binary digits?
Otherwise I'm in the dark on this one.

I wouldn't. If you want to mine, go to coinwarz.com or a similar calculator to see if it's going to be profitable. Trying to mine a block, however, simply isn't worth your time.

I've heard the argument made before that finance companies should be monitoring credit purchases for weapons.

Why is cash limited? That sounds like it would do nothing but cause problems.

Jokes on you I used my GPU as a Bitcoin miner/dorm space heater freshman year of college.

But then the value will ultimately become deflationary, permanently.

I suppose in theory it's not an actual problem, but it could be problematic for some use cases.
The amount of time that it would take to make a significant difference also outlives the life of Bitcoin, I suppose.

Well I don't think that any of us believes that criminal activity has gone up as a result of Bitcoin, so all that Bitcoin has done is change the means by which criminals exchange money.
Doesn't really matter how they exchange money, frankly.
@_date: 2016-07-19 22:07:03
I was responding to your mention of criminal activity.
On the subject of government intervention, I think it really doesn't matter. They can't prevent private transactions from happening, and if they do the community will adapt around it.

They may be able to stop the banks, but they can't stop things like localbitcoins. If they pulled something like that it the community could just find a way around it.
