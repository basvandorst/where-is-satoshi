Since everything I invest in I expect to go to zero, a method ive been using with good success is buy established companies hovering near their 52 week lows, and with a drop of at least 50%.  It my take some time, but more often than not they return to their medium (50% above the low).

This guy is a fool.  There are plenty of accounts offering some interest and they are more or less as safe as BOA.

They'll be back!  I remember years ago I was looking at thx ( then valued at like .0001) and didn't go, well they're steady at .07 now.  I bought some just for sentimental value.

If you cant understand that not ALL tripled, but in general across the board prices have tripled, then you need your head checked.
Enjoy the bath!

Excellent post.  I know the sting of financial failure when I went bankrupt due to real estate speculation in 2008.  I at least have a job and can continue on, but after that - never again! 
Rule in Eve online works in life - never ever invest in something you cannot afford it to go to zero instantly.  Hard rule to follow but very necessary.

It's not false, unless I'm on drugs and the numbers I'm seeing at the grocery store are jokes.   And housing prices going insane too really take this into account.  
Mate has gone from 60 to 180 in just one year.  Other good have easily tripled, others have only doubled, some haven't changed much.
You keep reading your magazines then if thats what makes you feel better. Take into account all this increase in prices plus relatively stagnant wages it is not far off from 8 times.  Math is the language, but if you don't know what you're reading, someone like you, then its pretty useless.
You're like the frog being boiled alive slowly and not noticing it.

I'm in Uruguay right now and am enjoying their 100% a year inflation rates.  Its not widely published, but prices have tripled over the last 3 years on all consumer goods.
