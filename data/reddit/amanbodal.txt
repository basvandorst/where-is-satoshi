So can I dump let's say 1 million bitcoins at once and convert it into cash ? 
@_date: 2019-01-20 12:14:39
Let's say place would be online that would be coinbase or some other online exchange then ?

So it's not like stocks which you can dump any time you like ? Right ? To sell a Bitcoin you have to a buyer ??
