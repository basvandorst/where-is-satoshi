If you could figure out where the price was going would you bother arguing with anyone about it?

He is a Bcash shill. there are plenty of videos on youtube of him saying deal with it.

yeah once we had these hashrate wars and spam on btc i think everyone really saw the value of having litecoin around with its different hashing algo and miner population.

good. fuck them. i hope everyone that isn't jihan switches because they like money.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:33:30
maybe intentional due to the fact that no one else could have possibly mined the genesis block and would be unfair if he could spend them.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:35:22
i really like this idea.

Don't tell me how to bitcoin.

i think most people actually believe their chosen project, its just that the people that believe in bitcoin more than altcoins historically have more power since bitcoin is more valuable, and use that power to absolutely control these altcoin markets, creating false demand, tricking small time gamblers into fomoing for sick gainz, and then dumping on them on the way up until they realize no one is there to support the high price run up. These people work together, and are more patient, cunning than you will believe is possible in this space.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:40:31
We need to protect ourselves as this becomes more prevalent.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:41:50
"Large bitcoin holders" like Roger Ver and Jihan Wu? I'm sure you can take it from that scale all the way down the coinmarketcap list. If it can happen with billion dollar coins, it is happening regularly with million dollar coins. I choose to not be naive about it.

FYI, this has happened on every exchange in the past 9 months, as crypto's Eternal September continues. No exchanges are safe, I am choosing to take risk here.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:59:00
Gemini has always been my recommended on-ramp, and will certainly continue to be. This is such a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:17:10
I would definitely ping them. Haven't seen month long wait times since the middle of the year.

man thats gonna hurt. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:36:38
and why is that? you didnt even make a point to listen to.

In 2014 there was a mining floor that we jumped off of for a quick price rise, then slowly sold off into and beneath it. The only "floor" in bitcoin when the true hodlers step in and refuse to sell into the market at such low prices while smart money continues to scale in, knowing its a matter of time before the cycle repeats. Same thing happens at local tops, true hodlers refuse to pay 10x a price 6 months ago while smart money scales out on the way up.
@_date: 2018-06-07 09:14:28
Someones got some new chips out thats for sure. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:09:03
Yeah I think when more brokers introduce bitcoin custody services like Fidelity, sentiment will start to shift and let in these new sophisticated investors we all have been waiting for.

besides the face they are obviously going to make tons of profit off fees, you have to account for the costs of storing coins absolutely securely
@_date: 2019-01-31 22:52:48
looks like coinsquare.

Sad story every time this happens. I particularly feel bad for the Canadian traders that by definition have money on the exchange. The risks are real and have real-world consequences.
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:38:40
thats just wrong. I have personally done it on bitcoin, ethereum and zcash.
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:00:28
this is that good shit
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:47:37
ive sent many 0 sat transactions to clean up my wallet during this fine time.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:25:33
it means i paid no fees to pool many transactions into one, sending to myself so no need for a rush. next time when there is network congestion I will be able to send a relatively quick and cheap transaction vs the large transaction with many inputs.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:12:56
instantaneous payment, clearing and settlement. looks like a real use case here boys.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:05:57
these will become an old and tired meme and people will stop buying them after they burn enough speculators. then exchanges will stop listing them, then we can bitcoin in peace.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:35:15
so you think we're trading with the exchange then? someone is depositing dollars with the exchange's bank and is buying your coin... wtf is this comment.

All you need to do is verify the details on the device itself, which you should have been doing anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:20:06
what he is saying is that in order for blockchain to work like it should it needs to have an asset tied to it(to pay for consensus/record keeping mechainisms) and it needs to be decentralized, otherwise its not new. basically saying bitcoin IS blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:25:35
blame jamie dimon there too
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:03:45
this was by far the largest crash in terms of percentage of bitcoin wealth wiped away, so its hard to realize it went up through $10 during this time for the first time then crashed back on the previous level of magnitude's($1) support.
