Mycellium Gear lets you do this and lets you manage your payments in Mycellium wallet (incrementing addresses after each payment received as per Bip 44):
Using a fixed address for recieving payments is not considered good practice as it undermines the anonomity of each payer.

Since the number of addresses in a Bip39 hd wallet is infinite I suspect that any randomly chosen wordlist that conforms to Bip39 would actually contain any arbitrarily chosen list of addresses.
This is obviously useless, but a surprising fact (if true - not 100% sure). And a bit off topic.

Why? Why do you need the WIF?
Why not roll the dice to create some entropy and then use the entropy to create the bip 39 wordlist that you can use to produce the HD wallet and as many addresses as you need.

There are potentially interesting financing models that could be developed with bitcoin.
I put up $30000 worth of bitcoin as collateral and they take out their payment + interest each month. If bitcoin has increased over the period they return the remainder, or if Bitcoin goes down I then have to continue to make payments to cover the difference.
I would be much more inclined to buy a car with Bitcoins if such a model was available.

When I type 'footbags bitcoin' into google the first link I get is  (which I'm assuming is still your website) - on this website it is very clear you accept Bitcoin.
There needs to be something about Bitcoin on every page otherwise Google will not find you when people search this way - people don't wait until checkout before they decide how they want to pay. 
I never browse a site unless it's clear how I am going to be able to pay - no one wants to get to the checkout and discover that the payment option they need is not available.

Also it's important how you check the confirmations.
A few months ago I made a transaction with blockchain.info and the transaction appeared on their address search as 0 confirmations immediately. 
The zero confirmation remained for several hours, so I tried searching the address on another service and there was no sign of the transaction at all. 
It turned out that blockchain.info were having server problems, but their internal process was still appearing on their own blockchain database. They were not broadcasting transactions.
There was no transaction and anyone accepting the zero confirmation evidence from blockchain.info would have discovered later that no real transaction had occurred.
EDIT: ie only accept zero confirmations if you can see the transaction on the actual ~~blockchain~~ Bitcoin network, or use a service that's independent from your wallet provider.

The impulse to personally survive is just a sympathetic response to our DNA's programming which ultimately is only about genetic survival.  
The pursuit of wealth is the pursuit of genetic survival - the more money we have the higher the chance of our genes surviving.
Personal immortality changes everything in that we no longer need to genetically survive beyond our self  - we are guaranteed genetic survival by our own individual survival.
 
The pursuit of wealth then ceases to matter = immortals don't need anything (especially not money).

This is not necessarily true.
I use a paper wallet and spend from it using mycelliums 'cold storage' feature - they return the change back to the paper wallet.
Obviously I wouldn't recommend doing this for large amounts, but it's a convenient way to spend from a paper wallet.
I'm not sure why you believe you would lose 9btc if you spend 1btc.
This would only happen if you are manually creating the transaction and forget to send the change back to the original paperwallet address, in which case the 9btc ends up as the miners fee.

A hardware wallet is really just a convenient &amp; secure way to manage a paper wallet.
The 24 word seed is your paper wallet.
The problem comes when you want to spend from a paperwallet - it's very hard to do this securely and manage where the change goes.

BTC.com is down for me, but a quick search suggests that you control the private keys and it is a HD wallet.
Do you have a 12/24 word phrase as backup? 
If so you can import this into another wallet, such as mycelium or electrum (I think?) and set your own fees.
@_date: 2016-01-03 11:15:33
I've never used Electrum so I decided to have a play with it.
First thing I noticed is that they have a Portable apps version - this makes it easy to experiment with.
Download the portable apps version 
Create 2 folders 'Electrum 1' and 'Electrum 2' and copy the .exe into both of them.
Go into 'Electrum 1' and run the .exe. 
You will be prompted to create a new wallet - do it and copy down the seed. You can leave the password blank.
Click on the 'addresses' tab and you will see a list of your receiving addresses.
Leave this open and go to 'Electrum 2' folder. Click on the .exe.
Choose 'Restore a wallet or import keys'. Click next. Enter your original seed. Leave password blank.
Click on the addresses tab again and wait for it to synch.
Now you have two open wallets - one you created and one you restored - they should be identical.
Compare the addresses to confirm it to yourself.
Delete Electrum 1 and Electrum 2 as they were just used to practice.
(Keep a copy of the portable .exe on a thumb drive so you can quickly restore a real wallet if you need to).
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:21:12
When you first initialise the wallet you need to do it safely - ie you need to use an operating system that doesn't touch the internet and never will (ie air -gapped).
'Ledger starter' lets you do this. It's just a bootable usb which you can purchase from them or download for free. 
Once you have the ledger set up and have written down the 24 word seed, you can then freely use it on any device without worring about virus' etc.

A logarithmic chart lets you see relative change. 
An increase from $2 to $4 looks exactly the same as an increase from $200 to $400 on a logarithmic scale.

People in China don't want to think for themselves beyond protecting their family.  
People break the rules in order to make money - if you walk down a street in China everyone is breaking the rules - the person selling shaokao at the side of the road is breaking the law but he has given the police protection money.
But if you go to China people aren't following the rules as in 'law' they are following social norms.
It's a social norm to find someone who can modify your electricuty meter, and then it's a social norm to buy the guys who comes round to check the meter a meal so they don't call the police.
The Chinese don't want to rebel - they want the government to ignore them. It's a reciprical relationship - you ignore the government and they will ignore you. 
American prisons are full becasue the laws are so rigid - it's easy to break the law and then it's easy to be prosecuted.

I eventually understood!
The advantage of handing over private keys is that they don't need confirmations - the merchant can accept the payment immediately.
Let's say I have an address with 3btc in it - I buy something for 1btc. With the right system my 2btc could be returned first to another address and then I can hand over the 1btc private key immediately without concern and the merchant can then accept immediate confirmation. 
Now lets say the POS was set-up so that at checkout I scan a QR code containing the private key and 'change' address (could be printed on a bill) - I then instigate the change transfer myself at POS and observe the transaction on the blockchain - I then hand over the private key to the merchant who can immediately accept payment with no waiting for confirmations. 
There is no reason why anyone would need to trust the merchant at all if we take out the change first. It doesn't even need to be a paper wallet - it just allows for zero confirmation transactions (sort of).
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:13:31
No, you use the words generated when you set up the mycellium wallet in the first place.  It's the same wallet.
If a thief can access your phone and has the pin (which he needs to make a transaction), he can also access the 12 word phrase.
He can then use the phrase to see all your transactions and all possible future transaction - he doesn't need mycellium wallet. He can just watch all the addresess in all possible accounts - even ones you haven't created yet.
If you use account 10, then he can easily watch this on any computer - if you go to some high numbered account and generate 50,000 addresses he would need to do this for millions of addresses, which at least gives you time to act and move your bitcoins to a new hd wallet.

You can create multisig addresses via  (download from github for offline use)
The bip38 created addresses can be used to construct the multisig
You don't need to do this offline really since the multisig addresses are created from public keys not private keys.
Only signing a transaction needs to be done offline.
There is no need to protect the multisig wallet seperately since the signing keys can be protected with bip38 as normal.

Create a normal single paperwallet address using BIP38.
 
Take the decrypted private key and use SHA-256 to hash it (ie like the secret exponent of a Brainwallet). 
Use the hash as 64 character base16 entropy to create a 24 word bip32 passphrase.
Set up your trezor/ledger wallet with the passphrase and then just store the paper wallet wherever you like - you can easily reconstruct the passphrase from the paper wallet when you need to.

Experiment with 
Create a 24 word passphrase randomly, and then add a password ('BIP39 Passphrase (optional)') - you will see it generates a new list of address tied to that password - ie you have a new wallet.
You can put the bulk of your funds in password protected addresses, and use the unpassword proteced wallet as normal - if funds move unsuspectedly, you know the wallet is compromised, but have time to move your protected bitcoins.

for 2. If you are concerned about randomness you can use   to input your own entropy (coin tosses, dice etc) and then copy the pass phrase generated into your bip39 page.
The other points (less than ideal) :
1 If you want QR codes it should be fairly easy to modify the javascript  - its the kind of simple problem that would make it worth learning javascript if you dont already know it.
3 you could use  to manually construct the transaction offline with your change address and then broadcast it online  - you could do this on an android phone in a browser, though it would be a bit clumsy. I don;t think that there is an app that lets you do this.
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:06:40
The main advantage (EDIT: for me) is that you can sign the transaction air gapped - if you have cold storage wallets you can avoid exposing the private keys to a computer that may have been compromised. 
Hardware wallets like trezor and ledger make this easier now for the average user - but it's still useful to be able to construct these transactions manually &amp; safely should problems occur.

This is how all wallets function - if you import a private key that someone else holds in another wallet you are at risk of losing bitcoins in that wallet. You would have the same thing happening if you used the Bitcoin QT client.
Every time you send bitcoins from another address, there is a chance that the change will be sent to the publicly known private key address. Everyone who imported the private key would then have access to this money - but they would all be faced with this same issue too.
Don't import publicly known private keys

I think the most interesting thing about this chart is how the April rally settled at about double the long term trend (if you connect the lows).
I think the explanation is that the rally was ultimately a post block reward halving price discovery, that eventually doubled the long term trend line. (ie nothing to do with Cyprus etc)
Seems almost too convenient that block reward halving doubles the value of bitcoin, but that's the trend I'm sticking to until it fails.
Let's see what happens in 3 years.

It's a Kazakhstan journalist being clever and using the limitations imposed on him to state the opposite.
It clearly is satire, but like a Goya painting (ie done right under the noses of the people being satirized).

I'd like to see the Bitcoin payment network exploited for people who have no interest in Bitcoin directly.
A service that allows them to pay wherever they see the 'Bitcoins accepted' sign, with zero fees.
This would encourage merchants to accept bitcoin and pass on their savings to the customer.
Bitcoin payment services have to seem free to use otherwise there is no reason anyone would choose to use them - monetization of the business can be pursued in other ways.

These seem to be private sellers.
There are also sellers already on taobao:
Since withdrawing BTCC is free, it's cheaper to do this potentially than a direct bank transfer

What if it's a donation address and you decide at the last minute to donate less than the checkout amount?

Isn't a screen print already an original work? 
Printing is a perfectly acceptable method of making art.
The person asking this thinks 'print' means 'copy'

I thinks it's a brilliant idea - Insawallet without having to trust a 3rd party. 
You stay in control of your private key (I imported mine into my blockchain wallet)
Put a few milliBitcoins in there and spend them without logging in - at least as safe as everything else I use live on the internet. 
Certainly safer than trusting a 3rd party for a spending wallet.
I'd prefer to use it in firefox though

Some guys who ran a bicycle shop put together an atm prototype using a raspberry pi and then manage to get a fully working commercial model together in 6 months and you are disgusted?

Any plans to extend this idea? - it would work well for escrow type services so that the bitcoins retain their value while both parties wait.
Also why is it app only - is there a specific reason for not running a browser version?
