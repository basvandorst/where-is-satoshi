When you paid a dollar ten thousand is a fantastic price. For all the fomo folk who paid 15,16, 20 thousand it’s a tragedy. And there’s lots of them and early buyers loved them getting in as it helped them out either as a get rich quick scheme or for true believers as a way of ushering in the new age

Easy to make claims like that without proof. Your public key would show you’re telling the truth. Waits......

Let me guess, you owned a Ferrari, sold it to invest in bitcoin and cashed out today lol how much have you lost?

with hindsight clearly yes, it would have been better even in a 0% interest bank account.

person with vested interest in the price rising and people buying says 'buy and the price will rise' lol!
he's hardly going to say 'by the way this will continue to crash'

But I thought fiat currency is worthless? If that’s true they have lost nothing, they own as many bitcoins as last week

is the poster trying to suggest that happening one will cause the others to follow? - i think that's what you call wishful thinking.
