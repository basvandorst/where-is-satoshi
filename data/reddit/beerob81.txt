Erm I know a guy who sells these at about 300-600 depending on size and quality and he's pretty effing loaded.  Just because this guy is busting a hustle on a gas station corner doesn't mean he's taking a risk.  He's likely minimized risk by eliminating overhead like rent and utilities.

Never been to a craft show. I would consider anybody who nets 300k or more, more than comfortable and to the average person "loaded" 
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:52:29
Let me put it into perspective for you.
On average (I'm in the same line of work, different products) we work around 57-80 days a year.  Grossing more than 600k-1m a year in that time.  Profit margins of 60-80%depending on the event, employee pay(if used) and so on.  You work out the math.  Remember, this is less than part time work.  I own other businesses as does he so in sure he is what most would consider loaded.  Maybe not wealthy but not hurting for cash.

clearly you don't understand business and the power of social media (yes this is social media).  I've gotten a response in my inbox from one of their staff and an email and the problem has been fixed.  Call it what you want but when things got fixed and thats all I care about.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:48:15
care to chime in?
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:31:34
well, that was the main reason I did it.  It seems the only people who actually got things resolved bitched about it here, they are members of the community and sometimes a little attention gets things done.  Not saying they wouldn't have done it anyways, but I wasn't willing to take that risk and wait.  Seems like a lot of people have chimed in and said their stuff was never resolved, they also didn't complain.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:38:51
I was discussing this with a friend, at this point I'd say the lowest we'll see this go is 275, I don't think we will see it in the 100 dollar range again.  That being said, I'm still comfortable buying at that price and even 450...though I'm going to wait this one out, I think if things go well at the Senate hearing we will see an insane spike....and then pop...if prices jump to 1000...(i know i know, its high) then drop it might be safe to sell a coin and then buy when it bursts.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:32:20
6 months ago has little to do with how they handle things today IMO.  My reasoning was because me and the friend who referred me had the same issue on the same dates at the same amounts and he had purchased with them before.  I had a little more to go on in thinking something shady was going on, so I brought new substance to the table.  I did search, and that search led me to make a post about it.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:38:35
I would, I know prices fluctuate, thats a given and I'm a patient person in most cases.

This is a perfect example of its usefulness...thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:23:06
well they resolved my issue and honored the original purchase price i.e. just gave me 1 bitcoin.  I went ahead and purchased another to see if there would be any other issues from here on out now that i've been whiteflagged.

Have you not seen the countless people who have written support and heard nothing?  Talk about whiny!  All you're doing is whining because somebody takes an issue public and asks for help from others who have dealt with similar situations.
Social media changed the game for how businesses treat their customers.  Word of mouth is faster and more instant than ever and as a consumer it's my ducking right to demand top notch quality.  You just don't fucking get it.  I don't doubt coin base is a good quality service.  As I stated, I already purchased again through them, I'm a loyal customer and as such I expect good service no matter the situation.  I used to run an online business that provided goods.  My shipping times took a terrible turn thanks to a supplier and people took to forums with pitch forks.  It took a lot, a metric fuck ton of work to rectify the issues and because I stayed in tune on forums and explained what happened. People understood and forgave me and sang praises afterwards for being so transparent.  I had a similar experience with a company in the cycling world and their ability to seek out offended customers online really helped their image.  So fuck off if YOU have such a problem with people expecting companies to connect better to their customers in a time when it's so damn easy to do.  Others do it, shit, if social media is good enough for them to promote their business as they have done, it's good enough to catch shit from people as well.

^^^I ^^^like ^^^koolaid
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:25:36
the fact that this is OBVIOUSLY a problem and that they are working on it.  They are compounding the problem because they aren't properly informing potential new customers to an existing issue, not even in their FAQ.  Clearly the issue was resolved quickly, who's to say it would have been resolved had I not said anything.  Like I stated before, there are plenty of people who have posted and months later STILL have no resolve.
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:16:35
So in talking to my friend that recommended me to them, he too bought another coin the same day and was rejected as well after he had already bought two from them.  I think it's obvious they're running some bullshit there
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:39:48
yeah...but the point was that would make a 70 dollar difference at this point...
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:42:54
didn't know they had their own sub.  I'll check it out.
Now to touch back on some of the things you mentioned.  if you search their FAQ its completely vague what qualifies as high risk, seems like that should be outright defined to potential and current customers.  Maybe you didn't see the other post where my friend who already bought coins weeks ago and then another at the same time I did also had his rejected, clearly he wasn't high risk before, and now he is, the one thing we have in common there is the time we bought and the price at which we bought along with the sudden spike in price, so one can assert that there is something fishy there, though not be 100 percent certain.
I came here to seek help from others who have had this issue, not just to bitch about coinbase, fact is, i'd still like to do business with them if they fix this.  I like their system the best from what I've seen.  It's just unfortunate that this happened.
I'll be checking out the other sub now.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:52:32
good to hear
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:40:16
same here.  I originally thought I was blocked because it wouldn't pull up, not the case...but damn, its frustrating.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:41:11
It's a fact it was your dog!  Stop being cheap and pay the $19.99 to fix it.  I gladly would've paid for them with my bit coin earnings if I had them.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:21:38
seems like it was his own fault...he clearly let the raccoon situation get out of hand.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:58:44
The only reason I originally "bitched" here was because I received no response in 4-5 days...which to me is eons in customer service, especially when you have no clue whats going on and you start to find out that others also have had the same issue.  I do appreciate them reaching out and fixing it, so I figured it's only right to let people know that they did do something.  Somebody else will have the same issue and I hope they find this thread.
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:02:52
Thus the reason I made sure to follow up on the fact they fixed it, though I doubt they would have done anything to rectify it on their own.  Being overwhelmed is a good thing, they need to focus on how to handle that influx of business and improve before it causes them to lose business
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:56:23
I think the fact that they are so inviting to new customers and allow purchases to happen so quickly opens them up to these issues.  They need a better system of instant verification that won't cause so many issues.
@_date: 2013-11-10 21:22:57
their customer service will change and does change, how they approach problems will change.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:34:57
agreed, both sides need to be discussed, good and bad.  We want to encourage adaptation to BTC for our own sake.  The more people who start using it, the more chance for it to succeed and really go big.  By no means am I an early early adopter to this, but getting in now still has plenty of upside in my opinion and I'm looking at becoming accepting bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:24:34
I wasn't trying to devalue BTC my point was their transaction times are faster.  Making it a more viable source for instant payment, unless something changes with BTC 
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:56:19
Hey, thanks for sending out the warning.  Just to let you know.  I checked and withdrew some coin back to another wallet...no problems whatsoever, even did it mid-flight.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:57:35
I've had zero issues.  Though I see your point, if they were to start scamming people they would quickly lose credibility and usefulness.  It's not in their best interest, especially at this stage of things.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:36:19
well, I don't want to say that they only respond to people who make a public stink, but I've often found that social media is a quick way to garner the attention of even the largest corporations when things go wrong.  It's understandable too, there has always been a serious disconnect between companies and the people that allow them to exist.  Social media has changed that.  You'd be surprised what a major airliner will do when they find out things are fucked up.
thing is, they fixed it and I'm happy and thats what matters, best of luck on your transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:12:14
wow, thanks for the tip! i'll be sure to pass on the kindness
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:29:01
I don't think its too far.  It's a public forum about bitcoins and people are going to talk about their experiences, be it good or bad.  problem is most people notice the bad over the good because satisfied customers rarely speak up.  At least they respond and fix things when they are brought up and that means theyre connected and have their ear to the ground and thats just as important as providing quality service.  
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:21:58
if their supply is limited, it should be clearly stated.  What they have available.  I truly think its just a matter of them holding bought coins and reselling them at a higher price to other customers...i'm almost certain you could buy a coin at the current price no real issues...I'm not willing to buy it from them just to see though
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:34:36
Well no.  I own my home.  32, have several businesses, doing well and looking at opening a restaurant next.  Paying my bills isn't really the issue.   Since these payments are immediate, not financing, what the fuxk of it to them if someone isn't paying rent on time?
@_date: 2013-11-06 22:41:02
I emailed them, though I got me email pretty late in the day I doubt I'll hear anything today.  You would think that after so many issues they would figure out a better way of following up with possible rejections, especially if they are "automated".

if its learning and advancing, it's clearly wrong and needs reworking.  Seems like such a system is nearly useless.  In the other thread somebody made mention of using a similar system that they had to discard because of false flags.

there have been plenty of people who still haven't had their problems resolved.  Something like this should be visible on their page rather than hiding it and people having to seek out a solution
@_date: 2013-11-11 03:01:40
the issue is their faulty flagging.  There should be a better system in place to begin with.  If the problem has been around for over 2 months, the problem should have long been resolved.  It's not how we tech companies operate.  Have an issue? Address it...it's why you have developers on hand, its why they get paid.

thing is, people will do their research and find threads like these and stay away.  had they just responded and did whats right I wouldn't really have an issue.  The only reason I went with them over others was they came recommended by the same friend who later got rejected as well, after he had bought 2 with no problems.  bad business is just bad business
