As much as you are willing would be extremely helpful.  Thanks!  :)

If you have an Andrioid, you can install Coinami, create a new BTC wallet, and **sweep** the paper wallet with that.  Once it's in there, you can send it directly to your Coinbase account.
Ignore the weirdos.  Feel free whatever you want with it, but please don't share the keys with anybody on the Internet.  There are entirely too many predators out there (as you can see).

Holy crap.. that was a toxic read.

Well.. we are all already here.  Let's hear them.  :)

Let that sink in.

Actually, there really are people in this world that are just plan "bad".  Free or not, they will always be around.

Whose yards did you mow to get that kind of jack in the 80s?  
I must have grown up in the wrong neighborhood.  :(

What is their equivalent to the GDAX?
(yes, I am still pretty new)
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:02:51
Move it to GDAX for free, then transfer out of GDAX to another place for free.

I have over a million septims, and about 10,000 caps.

You are an idiot.  Where did you get $100 at 13?

Top post.

You'll want to talk to a tax professional versed in crypto.
That said (I am not a tax professional), it's taxable when you incur some kind of "taxable event".  If you buy in 2015 and hodl until 2020, then such an event wouldn't occur until you sell it.  You'd pay taxes on your capital gains (profit - original cost), but on your 2020 return.

Jeeps do that for you as well.  Jeep = Just Empty Every Pocket

Dump it to a good hardware wallet, or a paper wallet.  Don't leave it on ANY exchange if you are intending to hold.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:06:07
The culture in the BeeCash community is unsettling.  If the technology is actually good, then folks wouldn't be trying so hard to sell it to you.  There would be no need to try to deceive folks, as the tech would speak for itself.  Yes, bitcoin has its problems, but minimal reading suggests that their coin does not adequately address them.  It's a band-aid coin. 
At least, that's what my gut says.  Between the deliberate deception going on in the community, and the behavior of that "Roger" guy, I'm completely put off with putting anything into it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:16:46
Wait.. what if I was already drunk?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:47:51
Roll it over into a Scottrade account.  You won't get pounded in fees, taxes, penalties.  You may pay a closing fee with the current 401k place, but that would be it (if anything).
There is no way to get it into Bitcoin without cashing it out completely and buying normally.

I use a new one.  I don't want my junk showing up too high in the food chain.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:50:01
It's actually something like:
"Bears make money.  Bulls make money.  Pigs &amp; chickens get slaughtered."
What it really means - don't invest using emotion.  You gotta shove that shit down DEEP when you do this stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:11:29
Some people call it junk, but I call it.. treasures.

That makes sensse.
I detassled corn for mine.  :)
Although, they wouldn't let me do it at 13 - state laws and such.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:31:38
I wouldn't do it for the long haul.  If you are not trying to time the market (which you shouldn't), then getting them in a paper or hardware wallet is much safer.
Google Mt. Gox to see what can happen to coins left on an exchange during an institutional insolvency.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:26
I am new to this as well.. and don't have any skin in hardware wallets (yet).  I've just been generating paper ones.
Here is some information on doing that:

It's all fun and games until somebody drags pubic hair into the conversation.  :P

Perfect.  Thank you!

Seriously - this is the kind of advice that makes this community so awesome.  Folks are looking out for each other.  :)

You can see his nipples through that shirt.  :(
Why did I not notice that before?

Gotta watch that stuff - makes folks antsy in the pantsy.

It's owned by the BeeCash guy.

There are plenty of banks out there that will leave you alone.  Switch.

I've done that in the middle of the night.

This was 7 hours ago.  I hope he didn't bleed out in his kitchen.  :(  He only had steak knives, some generic A&amp;D ointment, and a roll of gauze sitting there.

I would buy some PoopCoin.. if it existed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:22:09
Nope.  At least, mine doesn't charge to ACH money around.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:25
People like you are why I would never invest in Bcash.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:22:13
I signed up on Coinbase on Thanksgiving day.  My ACH verification deposits came through this morning.  After some horsecrap verifying my identity (it took several times to get my driver's license picture to actually authenticate), I was able to buy in this morning.
Yes, horrible entry - but I am one of those guys that will be sitting on these (and buying more with each paycheck) until it's time for me to **retire early**.
