Are you outside of the USA? I see the same terms that you see and am not US based. Perhaps they serve a different page based on geographic region.

I'm seeing what is seeing. I assume they are serving a different page to non USA regions.

It's not a suitable patch for normal use due to the effect on user balance. There's a reason the satoshi client allows spending unconfirmed change - it matches how the user thinks the wallet works. The user doesn't know about change. The patch would not be accepted as is.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:38:44
I should note that with the patch the effect on your balance can seem odd. if you have one output of 50 BTC in your wallet and you send 1 BTC to someone then 'getbalance' will show 49 BTC but a send of any other coins will fail until 2 confirms. You can see the sendable balance with 'getbalance \* 2' which will show 0 BTC. This is because the 'change output' of 49 BTC is unconfirmed and not sendable under the patch rules for 2 confirms.

There is no BTC functionality in Firefox OS devices. There are some bitcoin apps in the mozilla marketplace but no BTC wallets.

Even services that don't use transaction id can be bit by this bitcoin issue. 
If a site allows withdrawals and uses 'bitcoind' then one withdrawal can use the change address of a withdrawal prior to it even though that one has zero confirmations. This is a 'feature' of the reference bitcoin implementation so users don't have to wait for a confirmation before respending their own coins.
Unfortunately if that first transaction is rewritten by a malicious relay bot then the second is a double spend. The recipient will not get their coins. Every user of the reference bitcoin software can get hit by this issue and it will be more prevalent as more malicious relay bots become active.
Bitcoin isn't broken maybe but the reference software needs work to handle malleability. A [discussion on bitcointalk about it](

Someone needs to modify the bitcoin client to change the coin selection alogrithm so it takes into account the price that those coins were obtained at or what their basis value is.
The client could then optimize the coin selection based on minimizing tax footprint.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:36:09
I think that what is being seen is [the rewriting of transactions]( clogging up wallets with double spending of change amounts. The behaviour of the reference bitcoin client causes this. This has happened to me a number of times today.
A [bitcointalk thread with more](
What I've done to workaround is modified my bitcoind to not select any inputs with less than 2 confirms, including 'sent to self' change. I also modified "getbalance '*'" to show me the balance not including sent to self change so I can check the sendable balance under these rules.
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:46:20
I'm definitely seeing incorrect balances. The balance reported by 'getbalance' increases when a double spend of a change transaction occurs. I think the reference client is counting the change transaction twice. This is due to special case behavior where it counts unconfirmed change transactions as being part of your balance while ignoring all other unconfirmed transactions.
That's why my patch includes a getbalance patch - to provide a way of saying "what's my balance without unconfirmed change transactions".
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:32:27
Thanks, I put a [top level post]( here with a bitcoind patch with my workaround in case anyone wants to get something working quickly.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:45:35
I disagree. See [my post here]( In the case of spending unconfirmed 'send to self' change then the malleability causes issues. This can be a common occurence in an exchange, pool, or online wallet running unmodified bitcoind.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:48:41


The problem is the reference implementation has a problem with it. As mentioned in the original post it allows spending the change output while it is unconfirmed. If the original transaction that created the change is changed via a malleable transaction then a double spend happens. The reference client does not deal with double spends of change transactions well.

Namecoin allows arbitrary data to be stored. That includes material that is illegal in some countries. Not using namecoin avoids this problem and the excessive blockchain bloat that storing any data has.
@_date: 2014-02-11 14:58:34


It's somewhat harmful in that it can lock users funds if they spent the unconfirmed change output and that is double spent. They can recover though with some wallet manipulations. It's also possible for 'getbalance' to report the wrong value as it seems to double count the change transaction for both the double spent and the accepted transaction.
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:08:24


Arbitrary data isn't stored in the blockchain. It's stored in a distributed hash table. The blockchain is used as a timestamping service to ensure registered usernames are unique.

Unfortunately there are a lot more people who deposit sub cent amounts - especially from automatic withdrawals from mining pools - than withdraw large amounts. This causes quite a bit of fragmentation.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:54:09
I believe it's the transaction malleability issue. I've written [my workaround here](

The messages aren't stored in the blockchain. They are stored in a distributed hash table.

It's probably easier to trigger than mining four bitcoin blocks so the time spent exploiting is more profitable than mining.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:16:18
It's not nonsense. Check the namecoin blockchain yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:38:45


Not always. If their bitcoin wallet is fragmented then withdrawals that require pulling in data from lots of small inputs will fail. This will happen most with large transactions.
This can be common in exchange and pool wallets if they're not regularly defragmented as people like to deposit/withdraw tiny amounts.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:14:47
It is not 'lazy exchanges' that is the issue. If the exchange is using the reference client they will have withdraw problems and stuck transactions. Bitcoin developers recommend the reference client and prefer people not to use third party protocol implementations. The foundation has ignored Mt Gox's reports on the issue, blaming them as being incompetent, when there has actually been a problem with the reference client as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:35:59
Bitcoin was like this in the early days when it was worth little. People would give them away, donate, etc. It was a much more interesting community.l
@_date: 2014-02-11 23:00:56
For the curious, the getbalance change was done as my software checks the sites wallet balance before issuing a send and informs the user if there aren't enough funds available. I needed a way to know the balance that could be sendable.
@_date: 2014-03-27 11:08:53
Changing the coin selection algorithm doesn't change the protocol. Which inputs get selected to create a transaction are the concern of a client - having it in a website doesn't help. And if selecting some inputs over others reduces the tax bill then having a client does it would be a good thing for some people.

It looks like the key is to use target="top":
    &lt;a href="/sitekey" target="_top"&gt;the site&lt;/a&gt;
This is allowed by the "allow-top-navigation" attribute in the sandboxed iframe.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:12:43
I tried importing a private key produced by zeronet but the bitcoin client rejected it:
    error: {"code":-5,"message":"Invalid private key encoding"}
@_date: 2015-01-13 08:28:58
is it possible to create links in a site to other sites? it looks like absolute URL's don't work - is this due to the iframe sandboxing? For example:
    &lt;a href ="/sitekey/foo.html"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;
If 'sitekey' is a valid site it does not work to click on the link. Relative URLs work fine.

Actually puddinpop invented pooled mining and predates slush's work. It used a different system but was in use before slush's pool was active. See [this thread]( on bitcointalk.
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:21:33
Slush did not invent merge mining. The first person to create a merge mining implementation was vinced for namecoin. They created a python proxy program to enable getwork miners to merge mine bitcoin and namecoin. Slush was one of the early pools that started using it.
@_date: 2015-08-31 21:44:47
Sure. but that's different from inventing 'pooled mining'. Eleutheria of BTC Guild also developed something similar to stratum at the same time as Slush. He converted his implementation to match Slush when Stratum was announced. The history of pooled mining in Bitcoin is quite interesting.

I notice in the archive of emails that Dustin published that Satoshi uses the word "Sweet". This is a common kiwi slang term. Given that Satoshi also wrote using british english spellings, could he be a New Zealander? 
@_date: 2013-12-09 08:10:18
There are a number of merge mine coins that have had hard forks. I0coin recently hard forked when updating to a 0.8.x client to apply recent bitcoin fixes. That said, nice to see a smooth namecoin transition and hopefully a positive future.
