I'm 99% sure that BTC could drop to $2000 and they wouldn't buy.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:24:25
That's actually some solid advice for newcomers!
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:56:35
'Just 5% more and I will buy'... and the next day it's up 20%

Not exactly sure if you are serious with that question or not but I'm gonna answer it anyway. Maybe other people will learn something even if you are not being serious.


It's not about the hardware, it's about your private key. Most people don't write down their private key, instead they write down their 24 mnemonic words which every modern wallet can turn into the private key. That means, you aren't dependent on the app as in if you delete it you lose your BTC. However, you are still dependent on it as in if they put malicious code into it through an update then they could steal your funds.


You can either create a mobile wallet with your 24 words and delete that after you return home. This is probably the best option if you are on vacation for some weeks. If you don't want to do this you can pre-sign transactions from home and just broadcast them when you need to pay via your phone. However, for that you would need to know the recipient address and the amount of BTC you want to spend, so it's not an ideal solution. If none of that suits you then you need your wallet. In that case having a bluetooth capable wallet is the most comfortable.


That is a really broad question and I'm just gonna give a quick answer to it. Miners are responsible to verify your transaction and they will do this for a fee. The higher the fee the faster the verification. If your friend needs the BTC really quick then it's going to cost more. Also, if you don't use SegWit it's going to cost more. You also shouldn't compare banking to BTC. That's comparing apples to oranges. A centralized system is always going to be faster and cheaper than a decentralized one.


I think you mean Lightning. Lightning is a second layer protocol, meaning it sits on top of the original blockchain. I could go more in depth but most YouTube videos would do a more efficient job at explaining it. You don't need to worry about using it right now as it's still in an immature phase and will need more time. The reason there are now two "standards" is because it's way fast and way cheaper. It's like an upgrade. But again, that's a really broad question and YouTube will give you a more efficient way of learning it.


Agree, but this is not Bitcoins fault. How much do you really understand banking, yet you are able to spend money as you please without a problem. The first time online or mobile banking was probably strange but after a couple of transactions you got it. Same with BTC. There are already some really user friendly wallets out there but as long as people don't use them every single day they probably won't get used to it.


IMO it already is. As long as you didn't trade your brain for a brick you should be able to download a wallet app or register on one of those coinbase-like sites. However, something that is hard as of now is the buying of BTC. It's pretty complicated to buy BTC from a website and send it to your wallet. But again, that is not BTCs fault. You don't need to worry how you "buy" your euro, you get them from your work.


Gonna repeat myself here: Not BTCs fault. If you think it's a trade option then you view it as one. If you think it's a currency then you view it as one. Traditional money can be traded as well but most people don't so we don't view it that way.


Whatever floats your boat. But you can't just sit there in the corner having your arms crossed and whining that it needs to be easier. You wanna have it easier? Go out there and spend BTC. Buy stuff with it. Use it. Until then you can whine all you want because nothing is going to change.

Sorry, don't wanna disagree with everything you say, but no, it's not. It already is accessible to everyone but not everyone needs to know it. Only one, maybe two question you asked are important to the end-user. The remaining questions are way to technical for the average person to understand. 


Maybe, but I could say that you haven't seen the right websites or used the right wallets in that case. There are wallets that are a hundred times easier than the average mobile banking app. BlueWallet on iOS or Samurai on Android are two that I know are really good and I have heard really good things about Breadwallet and HOLD (or HODL, not sure) as well.


This is how bitcoins works. Of course the volatility is going the decrease as market adoption rises but Bitcoin is always going to be more volatile than current currencies. The reason being that the €, $ etc are artificially made stable and this is not good for a lot of reasons. I don't even call this a problem because there is no problem with it. It's just different. People will get used to it if bitcoin ever becomes a viable alternative. Until then it's a problem for early adopters. If you don't want to pay a premium (through volatility, fees etc) for being able to pay with bitcoin then you aren't an early adopter. That's fine but there are a lot of people who are willing to lose money just so they can push bitcoin further. And this is a slow process. Contradictory to most people on here I think it's going to take at least another decade until we can really speak about some market adoption.

I think the nice thing about learning that stuff is that you don't spend too much time on here. Don't get me wrong, this place is a great occasional visit but I just don't enjoy the vibe that you get here. It's tied so much to the current price. It makes you think that just because the price goes down Bitcoin is in a bad state. Instead, I like to look more for the technical side of things because you see constant improvement. Not numbers that are going up or down but real progress.


Thanks! Am really pleased to hear that!

You are right, just because something is a traditional currency doesn't mean it's stable. Obviously Venezuela and Zimbabwe are prime examples. But I don't think Bitcoin is ever going to reach the stability of the Dollar or the Euro. I read a really good book once, where the author said the best algorithm we currently have is the stock market. The stock market is able to adjust itself instantly after any event globally. Doesn't matter whether there is a volcano erupting in Hawaii or a hurricane in Japan. The stock market reacts within minutes. Now, the top currencies aren't like that. The dollar isn't going to drop significantly within minutes just because something happened in Japan. Because it's a centralized system, the government doesn't allow this to happen. But this is not the case with bitcoin. Anything, and I mean anything, can affect the price within seconds nowadays. Just a couple days ago we saw a 20% increase within an hour after someone supposedly bought $100 Million worth of Bitcoin. Hopefully in a decade this will just be peanuts. But other stuff won't. There will always be events that are going to drive the purchasing-power of Bitcoin upwards or downwards. Today it's ±20%, in a decade it might just ±5% who knows.

I know, but I like teaching people things and maybe someone new will stumble upon this and be a little bit more knowledgeable afterwards. Plus, since English is not my mothers tongue, I love to write it and train that way. Gotta take every shot you have.

It really hurts reading comments on their facebook page. It's like someone is hitting you straight in the face every time you read a word there.

Nice, so we are able to trade 2x around the time the airport in Berlin is up and running? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:21:18
I'm new to speculating with bitcoin but not new to bitcoin itself. I'm probably going to buy a little bit more in the weeks before august. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:56:57
I will definitely keep holding!
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:52:06
Yeay, I achieved something!
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:57:00
That's a cool post, thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:28:42
Buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:16:43
That's some good advice, ty! I got this habit to check prices every couple days from the stock market, but maybe this isn't a good habit with BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:59:12
Wow that sucks for those people. 
Yeah, I got this habit to check prices every couple days from the stock market, but someone here already said that this is a bad habit for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:51:25
Yea I'm just not gonna look at it for the next months. Otherwise I would probably get a heart-attack.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:06:43
Spent too much time there...
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:55:18
Oh I thought you always buy high and sell low? Damn, I spent to much time on again
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:37:33
That's my plan right now. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:24:39
Just after it went to $0.13 in 2024, haha. The volatility is just insane with bitcoins, but I love it.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:27:31
Definitely holding. I'm confident it's gonna recover soon.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:58:54
It looks beautiful. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:12:04
Speculating on bitcoins is not different than gambling in a casino. And if it really doesn't recover, than well "you win some, you lose some".
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:55:04
I only bought ~0,5 BTC so it's not a huge sum to lose. But I'm confident it's gonna recover that's why I'm just holding it for now.
