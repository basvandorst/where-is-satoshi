Yeah, same experience here. I think people aren't actually moving their BTC around and they just believe the FUD about fees and speed. Get your hands dirty people, use your crypto. Try wallets, buy stuff, send money to friends etc

I wish it was

Right, but this would literally be the first "crash" that didn't bounce back to an ATH. Of course we don't know what will actually happen this time, but that's just a fact.

What wallet were you using? I'm wondering if blockchain.info and GDAX are using segwit, or possibly helping piggyback small transactions for cheap fees with their volume somehow

I really love the square cash app actually..super useful to split bills with friends and stuff. Also, you can buy BTC instantly with debit. of course it's not as good as a "power user" platform like GDAX. But this is a simple app that Bitcoin newbies can feel comfortable on, and buy tiny bits (or a lot) of BTC easily 
Another thing I like is the square cash debit card...you can hold BTC in your app, and when you want to spend, sell some to fiat, then swipe your card
Done shilling Square now

I like Bread. Very simple Bitcoin wallet app. Makes the 12 word recovery seed something easy for people to understand. I think it's one of the best pure Bitcoin wallets on Android. Now that you can buy BTC instantly, it's actually good competition for coinbase. And with bread, you actually control your private keys. Would've been nice to be holding BTC in bread vs coinbase to be able to access all forks and airdrops (wasn't possible with coinbase)

Probably because someone has so much BTC that they are profit taking in the form of a lambo. Pretty sure Peter (guy in the pic) paid like $107 for his lambo when you consider his dollar cost average.

Hmm. My TA says USD is about to bull flag double bottom and we're due for a nice bounce back to 7 cents. Amiright?

I'm 99% sure you have to sell your Bitcoin to USD first.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:12:31
Right, it doesn't depend where it came from. Except when BTC becomes 99% of your net worth, you might want to hedge out into other assets. Some people really love collecting cars. Some cars will actually appreciate in value too

"cryptocurrency" "experts"

Whether it becomes reality or not, people are excited that someone this successful and influential in business, would even believe something like this for one second. Of course anyone with common sense should take it with a grain of salt, and not bet the farm on it. But it is something to think about. Or just say LOL WHAT A DUMBASS, I'm sure you're much smarter than Dorsey.

I tried transactions again like last week after being scared off, and was really surprised at the speed and low fee. Then I started wondering why I was holding other "currencies". That said, I'm still holding those bags too

"It's goin tah ZERO! Wake da fuck up! I know EVERYTHING about cryptahcurrency. Believe me, i was gonna mine this SHIT befor u even FUKIN knew what the FUK it was."

What if he just does it, live streaming, full on psychotic break 
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:03:09
It's probably a good thing that he's mentioning Bitcoin to all the kids/people watching him. Of course I wouldn't donate to him myself, but he is a big influencer right now and it can only be positive long term
