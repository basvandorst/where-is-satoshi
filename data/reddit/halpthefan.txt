Know that feeling. I've been talking about it to my partner on and off for the past week. I decided to get 0.02 bitcoins....right before it dropped 20%. Shut me right up.

As an Australian, who just got his first proper Smart Phone, which has NFC, thank you for being progressive in our shitty country.

Just sent a bunch of stuff off today
 Doing it now :)

I'm not really. I'm just being hyperbolic. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose more than a few hundred, let alone a full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:07:51
No such thing, eh?

For them two bit hoes who be after his coins, ain't got beer in his stomach but fire in his loins,

Is it possible to get an ELI5 on MtGox? I'm so confused and amused right now.
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:32:02
Ha there's no way I'd win that and there's no proof you'd do it

Wow, thank you friendly stranger. I just wish I had a sizeable amount of bitcoin to tip you.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:05:38

I've tweeted a few people your story + told a bunch of video game journo and tech journo mates your story. I have to say, you are one awesome dude I hope to do the same thing in a few weeks when I head to Sydney. This year has been a bitch, but hoping next year can be totally awesome and bitcoins are apart of it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:57:54
Congrats on the dumb luck. I'm just enjoying the really positive outlook everyone who posts stories on here. Hope you spend the 2.88 when it goes past 1200 in a few weeks (hopefully)

I just watched his routine while waiting for my Doctor. I was thinking wow, I should tip him some money when I get home and then I was like lol, I can do it now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:25:29
I'd be happy to set up a subreddit where everyone can post their stores and online services which take Bitcoin :) Maybe @_date: 2013-12-01 09:19:48
You're doing Godbot's work.
