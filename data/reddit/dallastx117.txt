Jealousy, IMO. They are looking for any excuse for not being smart enough to get in. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:59
Gemini, and congrats 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:57:32
That kind of stuff leads to bad blood. 10% could very well end up being thousands of dollars. Somebody will balk. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:04:33
You don't sell them dude 
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:47:38
Their fees are high 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:43
This isn't 2013 anymore.. the market is significantly different. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:48
It's probably being spammed by the bitcoin cash peeps. It clearly looks like an attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:05:12
Beginners... Coinbase or Gemini
Gemini lowest fees but Coinbase has litecoin so... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:19
Seems like a crescendo today... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:25:24
I assure you I still have them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:14:58
DDos attack

I did earn it in BTC... I am Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:15
That's all irrelevant if it ends up being viewed as a commodity... which it very well could 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:43:47
Solving the algorithms cure cancer. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:24:52
Coinbase sucks... super high fees 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:38:53
I think it crashes after the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:18:38
Investors will flock to whatever is most profitable.... what the community "supports" is kinda irrelevant and as far as I'm aware... I'm the only billionaire in this sub 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:45:22
Ok, let's say you trade your btc that you've gained on for ether or alts... would that be reported? I guess what I'm asking is are you only liable when you convert back to fiat? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:40:10
Have a feeling when the resistance breaks through it's going to be big 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:34:31
I find myself laughing at the other sub quite often 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:19:25
This is what I'm leaning toward... some cryptos will have value as commodities and others for utility. Interesting futures ahead 
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:05:22
The 1.49% fee isn't worth it when you can buy from an exchange like gemini and pay 2 bucks flat. Coinbase is a rip off. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:52
I believe it must be. The odds of all them going down at nearly the same time are remote. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:14:01
When will the US economy collapse? Not anytime soon 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:35:48
8k by the top of the hour more like lol 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:22
So what if you sell a little bit of btc, then wait for a drop, and buy back in all on an exchange... you supposed to report even a couple hundred bucks?
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:29
Less than 10% are even aware of what it is. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:21:41
Must be the reason socialism keeps failing... they didn't have bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:21:56
Dallas? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:24:26
You can put all those on any of the hardware wallets mentioned above. The alt coins start to have different forms of wallets and what you can use/can't. The biggest ones you can put on a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:09:30
The value has been inflated with fake money... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:53:47
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:14:35
Yea, but how would anyone find out? Say I live in a non-disclosure state where real estate purchase prices aren't reported to authorities. It would seem impossible to get caught. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:25:53
what is the cause of the next dip 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:37:05
Not necessarily a good thing for some countries. Debt isn't inherently bad, it helps the economy and world function. If the USA couldn't take on debt shit would be real bad. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:11:45
What I want to know is... who are these effing idiots who start selling whenever they hear bad news out of China? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:47:08
I was kidding. Throw it into the pile of excuses I always read why it doesn't work 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:18:40
 An overnight collapse of fiat would result in anarchy. The price of bitcoin would be the least of your worries. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:46:22
If you bought goods directly in bitcoin there's no way they'd ever find out 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:45:56
It's the currency of the future my dude 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:19:40
Thank god I didn't get a loan from these fools 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:54:24
Takes 4 - 5 days. It's the advantage of getting the instant funds available.

If there is no adoption, then what the fuck is the point of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:02:35
Markets react to what influential people think. Buffet just has to mention a company by name to have an affect on value. Same with Trump. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:46:28
You probably shouldn't be "day trading" unless it's something you are willing to spend a significant amount of time on. Basically primary source of income. You will need a lot of money to make a living off it. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:06:56
Theoretically speaking... if I made a nice profit on bitcoin and used that profit to buy a house via bitcoin, couldn't I avoid paying taxes on that gain?
