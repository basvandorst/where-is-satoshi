ELI5: does every average user need to use LN for it to "work"?  What happens if just major institutions use it -- folks like Overstock (major merchants), exchanges, banks, etc.  Genuine question.

But why would Bitcoin be considered a financial instrument (such as a swap) or a security (such as stock)?
And why would someone involved in Bitcoin be givng the financial advice required to make them an Investment Adviser?
I personally think some regulation is needed, but that's on the *bank* side.  That is, banking regulations need clarity so that exchanges and transmission can be fostered in the U.S.  But to me this would have nothing to do with the advisors, securities, etc. areas that you're referring to.  That's more Bank Secrecy Act, OFAC, etc.

I know.  It's killing me.

I do agree that a "BitLicense" would probably have onerous provisions on the business/exchange selling BTC.  (Probably in terms of AML, OFAC, Deposits, Documentation, Quarterly Reports, Background checks, posting bonds, etc.)  All of that would be overkill, obviously, but it is nonetheless foreseable in today's environment.
Which brings me back to my point -- this has absolutely nothing to do with the way IA's or Broker/Dealers are regulated.  Most, if not all, regulation of IA's and Broker/Dealers has to do with ensuring the public gets honesty, good financial advice, and isn't swindled by complex financial products.  These are sales guys pushing variable annuities, not an electronic BTC exchange.  Apples &amp; elephants.   
It would be like an Oil &amp; Gas guy posting on Reddit "look how much I'm regulated -- don't let that happen to BTC!"  While it's true that over-regulation of BTC is a likely possibility, and it's also probably true that petrochemicals are over-regulated in the United States, there's no link between the to, and no reason to think that BTC would be regulated in a simlar manner.

Fair enough, I just think Redditors might be a bit misled into thinking that this is what will happen to BTC if the U.S. "regulates" it.  But what you're discussing are regulations that apply to *people/companies* who give *investment advice* and *sell securities/financial products*, whether BTC is involved or not.  
But at the end of the day, if BTC is "regulated" in the U.S. it won't look anything like what you've described.  (Other than the fact that, if investment advisors are recommending it to their clients as an investment vehicle, they'll still be subject to the same regulations you're referring to.)

You're exactly right.  For example, if you trade a car for weed, the car is subject to forfeiture.  It doesn't matter if it's a "monetary instrument", a financial instrument, or a musical instrument.

The clause after the semicolon is unnecessary.
