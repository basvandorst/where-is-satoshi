The greater point is that Coinbase has been and continues to be misleading to their customers and [investors](
I wish it wasn't so, I want to like the platform. It's done great things for the cryptocurrency/blockchain movement, but this was the final strike for me.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:10:23
Unfortunately, I doubt that level of self awareness would occur during a conversation about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:16:29
Gotta love those Christmas bonuses!
And I completely understand what you're saying. I tried to do it like you're saying and it ended up burning me(at the time) . I had to take the emotion and the decision out of the dollar cost averaging
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:32:14
My suggestion would be invest $150 a week the same day each week to dollar cost average and take the emotion out of it.
Then with the extra $50 you're big each week use those to buy the DIPS. Don't buy it when the price is running up bc you're scared you're gonna miss out.
Then you're getting the best of both worlds which seems to be what you're trying to do

My problem is announcing it for one date (including to your investors) and then springing it on everyone on another date two weeks earlier.
Ideally, it should have been available at the time of the fork, but coinbase said they were doing it one way and then did not. 
It is impossible to trust or believe Coinbase's announcements, unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:05
This is about the way they went about it, not whether the users are getting it sooner or later.
I agree it's much better to get it sooner, but again it's not about that. It's about that if coinbase was going to do that then why did they announce something completely different? Why did they lie to us, the users? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:23:29
Wait so $200 a week or when it's a good buy in? Cause those can be very different
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:57:04
Anytime, keep pushing yourself and I'll do the same. Appreciate you and cool to see ppl like you in the bitcoin universe
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:53:32
This is about the way a business runs not bitcoin vs BCash which is clearly the reason you commented. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:38:34
Then why say something different? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:31:00
Running on something and actually being something are completely different

@_date: 2018-08-20 11:56:16
Is it hard for Venezuelan's to find the BTC&gt;Bolivar exchange rate Bolivar&gt;USD? If so, how is that being remedied?
Would it be beneficial to put those exchange rates on the BTC blockchain every day or even once a week as a censorship resistant solution? 
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:24:47
Yup, that is the origin
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:50:49
I am definitely hoping for that, but I'm thinking I will probably have a 50-75% success rate with my family and just bc a family member doesn't necessarily buy into Bitcoin right away or it takes  few years, I wouldn't want them to lose out on this gift.
One option I've thought about is having a wallet with their balances kept and I can give them updates until they do come around to the Bitcoin ecosystem. My biggest hang-up with that is it being a Christmas present, it won't give them anything to open.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:03:14
Best answer
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:24:07
I think a lot more people have him money too
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:47:29
Oh I'm definitely behind ethereum as well and have a few other Altcoins in my portfolio. Was just interested on your take on Litecoin. Thanks for the great answer! 
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:53:09
Any idea where the stream will it be hosted?
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:13:14
I do like this idea. I'm mostly worried about those accidentally getting thrown away or wearing out.
I do think it may be the best option short of a hardware wallet, though
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:11:35
Back up the keys on a hard drive and write them down in a notebook
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:35:30
And I'm pumped for you! I was just telling him how you got even more. Congrats, dude. I'm glad you're in the game with us now. 
I hope you didn't think I was hating on you in any way or this community. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:19:16
Curious, why litecoin? Isn't it just a lower valued clone of bitcoin? 
Not arguing with you just really wanting to learn
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:51:20
That is a great idea
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:24:30
Shit, I'm 26 and that's a lot of money... 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:15:29
Start working towards that now! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:17:59
Aw yes, I saw your comment somewhere else saying that. That really sucks, man. 
Start dollar-cost or value-cost average investing to earn it back slowly
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:01:44
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:23:45
Very cool! 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:39:34
Unfortunately only almost 2%. I'm about to start doing something small to add more like $20-$50 a week into BTC &amp; ETH
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:45:57
That was a really well written and thought out post. Thank you
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:41:58
Lol hype is going to the moon, if nothing else
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:21:49
Even better
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:48:11
Just think, if Bitcoin reaches $1,000,000 that's $0.01/Satoshi. Pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:44:34
Interesting, I had never thought about that before
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:23:12
They have some cool wall safes on Amazon and at home depot. Hide that shit and make sure no one can walk off with it and you're probably good

In her defense, it was 7am and I'm not a morning person either. Also I don't she was really angry and this was a big deal

Is there a list of segwit wallets
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:04:18
If you put money in coinbase and then move it to gdax (no transaction fee) and then place a limit buy there is no fee
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:07
Discussions are ok here
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:02:36
Based on past Bitcoin history, I would expect a small, quick correction/dip and then back up higher than ever more quickly than anyone can anticipate
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:38:51
I see 1.25% with Ally (who I save with since that was one of the best I found). I'll check out the others though
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:06:56
I think automating the investment process and taking the emotion out of it is key.  
My strategy is to buy at market price at the same time each month with the same amount that way the price doesn't affect my investment and I remove emotion from the situation.
Now if I want to get emotional about it and/or have fun and try to buy the dips or do any other kind of investing then I might save some extra that I keep as a little lump sum to buy at those times. Lately I've been selling a bunch of stuff on ebay to do just this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:48:17
Do good, my man
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:30:33
It takes time to get there though
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:42:07
While most of us here are very happy to answer these questions here there's a really good beginners subreddit called r/bitcoinbeginners

Tales from the Crypt ep 1 &amp; 2
The host, Marty Bent, even does a montage of one of the years.
Best bitcoin podcast imo although it's only 7 or so episodes 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:16:59
There should be one more at the bottom that says "The price broke $9000!"
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:00:00
It 10x'd this year and everyone is saying 2018 is gonna blow 2017 out of the water.

Then your tattooist will know it! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:44:08
And then with any extra after that: buythe dips.
You can set market buys for those for what you think the price can drop to. Just don't get impatient after seeing a market buy. I would say leave the market buy out there least a week if it hasn't filled 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:08:57
We're honestly rivals

Satoshi is from Dallas?! I would have at least guessed Austin
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:14:56
Not automated as in hands off bc I haven't been able to find a way to do that yet.
Just automated as in you use the same amount at the same time every month at market price. That isn't a decision point it;s just an automatic thing you do every month.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:55
All the beginners are on coinbase everyone ever gets on the other exchanges then. We're all on at the sane time. I don't think it's that wild
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:01:25

Haha no kidding. I just mean in terms of the Bitcoin you're holding
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:30:23
The only problem I have with what you're saying is that if you're invested in the SP500 you're losing out on BTC when the price goes up whereas if you're gaining interest in btc then you're protected from price increases
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:38:24
I agree completely, my only point is that your second option to just HODL is the ideal choice
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:11:13
Awesome! Welcome to the club!
I'm not much more experienced than you. I bought my first Ethereum in May and my first Bitcoin in June.
What ledger is that? Is that provided through the exchange you're using?
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:30:59
Agreed! By far
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:33:02
All very great points that I did not know
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:56:17
Fees are going down quick
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:31:52
I think it's a human nature thing. I'm not entirely sure
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:53:17
I like ethereum a lot as well. It's not the tiny price you're taking but it still could have some major ROI
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:32:08
 I like it, but there support sucks.

I think this is a perfect bullet list for beginners and people you want to explain bitcoin to
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:56:59

@_date: 2017-09-21 00:15:59
That's awesome! Sounds like he's got a good head on his shoulders. You're just fighting against 71 years of brainwashing.
I feel the same way when I talk about climate change and homosexuals with my conservative, southern family. Slowly opening up Haha
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:33:32
Supposedly it's better to buy on Mondays and sell on Fridays
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:33:49
I have seen a lot of ppl who say the things that OP is talking about without the caveat's you responded with.
Your initial comment may have sparked OP to post this but only after seeing many ppl say the same thing before you and without your secondary comment of replacement. 
Don't take it personally. If you stand by what you said than don't worry if you think someone is hating and also take a step back and think maybe he isn't just targeting you.  
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:00:33
I've found that those very questions are the hardest to answer. Bc no one knows and it's all speculation at this point. 
But you know, you can't get in on the ground floor if you wait for it to get to the tenth floor to prove itself. I want in on the ground floor and I feel like that's still where it's at.
And I want my friends and family to be there with me.
I already decided I'm going to invest $100 into bitcoin throughout the next few months for each of my immediate family members and give them a paper wallet for Christmas.
Also one of my friends asked me to pay him back for something in bitcoin (I was thrilled) and I have so bets I intend to lose just to get other friends into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:19:04
Agreed! I have family, friends, groupchats, and coworkers now that will come up to me and ask about something they heard in the news or will say something to put down btc (not all of it is bad, but the first few conversations are usually dissent).
I've found it can give me a big head at times, but then I think "I have barely even scratched the surface and will likely take years to even get there."
It humbles me and drives me to learn
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:22:02
Thinking about the same thing but with my online website/store I'm starting. I havent even begun to look into it yet cause I'm honestly intimidated.
That tells me there are so many opportunities for business to start that pave the way for commercial/retail bitcoin use
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:28:30
And if not? He doesn't need a reddit account to be invested in bitcoin

@_date: 2017-09-20 23:59:54
I think I've seen you on here taking about your dad before. 
Keep it up, it sounds like he's definitely coming around compared to your posts before
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:55:16
OK so I think my confusion then is the difference in running a node and mining. And how come mining has a bitcoin "incentive" and running a node does not if its so important
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:35:36
For fun. And as a conversation starter at the office

Cool man. It's still a great outlet to spread the word for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:21:25
Probs now. Maybe tomorrow
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:30:32
Can you only buy with bitcoin or Euro's from the official site?
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:58:28
So then maybe he wasn't calling you out?

What was the argument you heard today? Just interested
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:52:36
Very nice. I'm a big advocate of Ethereum. In my mind if Bitcoin is gold then Ethereum is copper. It can be used as a currency but it has a lot of utility as well. 
Are you just recently starting out?
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:24:42
That's fine. I just don't appreciate the nationalism it tends to stand for these days. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:20:45
What was the price when the $8000 was invested?
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:07:18
I get what you are saying and appreciate your post, but segwit2x is not a compromise. It was a decision behind closed doors that is not in line with the vision of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:48
I love gemini and don't hear enough praise for it around here
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:30:42
I had a standard account info ticket out with them. Took them something like ~90 days to get to it (I solved it by then)
Stay strong. I do believe poloniex is working hard. There is a lot of fast growth that is sometimes to keep up with in the business side. Hopefully it is resolved in your favor
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:15:06
Interested as well
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:44:46
Ethereum. It's a network. If bitcoin is gold then ethereum is copper. It can be used as a currency but also has utility 
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:34:56
They've had customer support issues. I believe two hacks. I do not like that they have futures on the segwit2x coin.
Correct me if I'm wrong on not wanting to use it because I would love to buy iota 
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:48:49
While I agree with everything else you said, it could be a problem if one "group" buys a majority of the Ether 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:33:41
What you said, basically
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:50:59
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:46:15
Yeah that is my routine, every three months. You're saying it should just be immediate instead? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:41:06
Thank goodness and thank you for pointing that out
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:54:22
I love this community and am very active in it and I gotta say: I can't agree with you more.
While we should talk about the fork and what it means, demonizing the other side isn't the right thing to do.
Bitcoin is such an amazing thing, but a little poison can pollute the whole stream.
Edit: it sucks but it's funny that your post had become a self-fulfilling prophecy of ppl just bad mouthing r/btc
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:36:38
Heck yes. I will say (not from experience) I think you should get one of those mesh bags underneath the seat. You never know when you're gonna need to carry something with you
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:27:20
Thanks! I really appreciate it
@_date: 2017-10-03 11:37:37

@_date: 2017-10-19 12:40:22
I'm a lot more annoying to my friends bc I can't seem to shutup about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:00:07
That was a really good segment
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:26:36
Coinbase is the easiest by far (in America) although not recommended for long term
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:26:19
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:20:43
How is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:18:26
I can't remember what all of our signs said but they definitely followed all the rules. Had about 5 different signs. All taken when going in
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:15:42
Do you know of any tutorials for this? 
I'm a compete noob to setting up a node but have a raspberry pi and arduino lying around that I'm itching to use for some decent purpose 
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:40:57
Dude I'm so excited for you
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:42:03
Okay cool, thanks for your thought out answers. Definitely along the lines I was thinking but couldn't put into words or back up
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:09:49
Also, I had to look up what fair dues meant in your first comment Haha
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:50:08
I think the B's should be rotated so much that the cross in the middle makes an X
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:15:19
There's always a chance it can die. That kind of thinking is dangerous. Nothing is too big to die
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:13:42
I guess I don't quite understand what a node is yet
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:02:11
I love humble bundle
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:39:13
So when the candlestick charts are red does that mean more people are selling and vice versa for the green?  
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:08:08
Is 50 years old 20 years from now or is well before 50 years old 20 years from now? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:10:52
I hate when I see his MAGA pic on the front page of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:26:39
If you add funds to your USD wallet with a bank account then you avoid the crazy fees

I love Honda Ruckus' and especially that color. Any plans to mod it? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:03:24
Do you think it's worth getting my bitcoins off the exchanges before the bitcoin gold fork?
I know, I know. Never leave bitcoins on an exchange, but I move them over every 3 months. This is just the middle of my 3 months   
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:32:39
I love this sub... And hate it so much
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:58:45
I think I'm hitting that know-it-all phase. I realized that on the ride home from work and told myself I gotta tone it down and work on learning more
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:38:42
More than a hundred, or more than a thousand, or more than ten thousand.
For me personally I don't want to lose any, but it just depends on each person really
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:50:43
I was thinking about it. 
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, you have the private keys with Jaxx
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:15:12
I think one day it could be a currency, but we are a long way away from that. I do think that should be the goal, but it's a store of value right now
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:13:38
Unfortunately the only place I know to buy iota is bitfenix and I really don't want to get involved with that exchange
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:16:18
Anyone tried out that app? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:44:47
Then especially not creepy. Based on the filter on the snapchat it looks like this was at the university of West indies st. Augustine. I think that's in Trinidad 
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:28:36
How many people do you estimate hold bitcoin? And how? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:05:10
Very fair points. Does the lower price of ethereum have any effect on that though that you can think of? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:48:47
No, you will have both
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:09:09
I ask Madam A every morning. I just wish she did Ethereum too
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:58:18
I bet that's gonna be worth a lot more one day. You might as well put it in a wallet that you hold the private key for and forget about it
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:54:17
I'm wondering about jaxx 
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:28:15
It is, the acronym was added later
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:02:18
And he keeps it "realistic" enough for people to buy in before they realize these are some low ball numbers 
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:17:23
Glad you took the time to say this instead of the 3 second response you could have given him.
I get your point, but let's try to make this an inclusive community. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:23:08
That would be pretty cool
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:10
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:11:28
This doesn't help
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:05:02
I think gold and silver and bitcoin have a lot in common. I don't think either is a bad investment at this time.
And I did buy back the same amount in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-08 23:47:28
They are different cryptocurrency's that someone else created
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:08:07
So working with only the ppl who use the internet it looks like anyone in the first 97 million are the "innovators" and mass adoption will occur when there are 1.95 billion bitcoin users.
Yep still a long way off
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:08:49
I know one estimate is over 7 mil
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:14:12
And then immediately buy back the amount I just spent 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:17:15
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:13:20
I was checking it out while waiting for your reply. Seems real legit. I like how it has no access to withdrawals or trades.
And the layout of the site is really nice. It really gave me a lot more info then I was expecting. Which is why I asked for your sell in the first place.
Thanks for the reply! I'm definitely gonna give this a go when I get home from work.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:15:11
Reply to an old comment, I know, but sell me on cryptolend if you have the time and want to help a fellow investor
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:57:26
Well BTC is a little different on the selling side, bc on average the price has only gone up, so hodling is the best tactic rn imo. Rather than buying and selling.
My tactic is to buy and hold as early as the money i'm investing is available due to the fact the btc had only been increasing, on average.
The Monday, Friday thing is just an interesting thing about human nature
