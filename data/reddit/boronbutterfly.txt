Bitcoin is the most used by that measure.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:24:07
How are you measuring “most used”.

He really claimed bitmex bankrupted millions of people?

I proposed once and for the following weeks I had to listen to how small the diamond was and how it didn’t compare to her coworkers.  I called that shit off and took back the ring.  Best decision I ever made and she turned out horrible.  I dodged a huge bullet.  Diamonds are a scam and anyone who buys into them is an idiot.  It was impossible to sell that ring for what I paid or even close.

Same thing that happened in Egypt when they shut down the internet.  Everyone went outside and overthrew the government.

Bitcoin doesn’t try to be perfect.  That’s a dumb premise you made up to try and validate your argument that centralization is good.  Fail.
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:04:05
Come the fuck on!  Just because this guy talks shit about Bitcoin doesn’t mean we should start paying attention to what he says about anything.
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:56:06
He gave no timeframe or details on what he described.

Alex Jones says a lot of stupid shit.  Only idiots listen to him.

Fuck Alex Jones

Bitcoin is more than a currency.

Do not get married.  Do not buy a ring.  Hold a few years and reevaluate.

How is that not organic?  Whales exist in every financial market.  People dumping at “strategic points” exists in every market.  Do you always talk from your ass?
Edit; I checked your submission history and you do indeed talk from your ass on the regular.  You’re a toxic little fucker.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:31:00
He’s a nocoiner.
@_date: 2019-02-24 11:03:33
Nope 
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:30:28
What bank?  I would not tolerate that.
@_date: 2019-06-19 01:39:43
Off topic but semi-relevant is my guess.
@_date: 2019-02-27 19:49:34
That’s not logical at all.  The loaned money still devalued at the same rate as everyone else’s and you’re paying interest on top of it.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:30:39
Discourse for the sake of discourse is a lot like trolling.

It can change on a dime.  A green day guarantees nothing.

But paper currency steals from everyone equally..

We are decades away from mining asteroids.

Not going to happen.  People would just buy it below market rate and then sell on the open market to pocket the difference.  Auctions are usually where big pockets can pick up large amounts without affecting the market price.
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:05:34
That’s not normal, I would take my business elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-06-10 10:04:10
Sell and go away.  Never invest more than you can afford.

Dash is a shitcoin.

There is no spend, only hodl.

It’s really irritating how the media reports Fakeamoto’s lies as facts.  There’s no proof Kleinman and Wright worked on Bitcoin at all or that Kleinman was a “computer genius” whatever that is.
@_date: 2019-06-18 16:01:18
Serious gold bugs hold Bitcoin too.

Would India allow USD in their borders?

Just based on the answers I can tell the AMA is fake.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:11:51
Can you explain what an organic market is?
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:16:02
Don’t use the word organic if you want people to take you seriously unless you are discussing agriculture, farming or chemistry.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:33:26
Bullshit blockstream propaganda that’s years old and tired.  Your centralization argument is especially funny.  Pathetic attempt to manipulate.  Get a better script, yours is old and worn out.
Edit: You removed the blockstream propaganda.  Good dog.
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:09:17
Dash is trash and all the marketing in the world won’t change that.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:29:07
The topic here is about cash.  Loans are financial instruments and we can just as easily create crypto instruments that remove all the advantages/disadvantages of crypto.  
My point was that the premise for the headline is a contradiction and fallacy.
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:16:31
Nowhere does it mention bitcoin, crypto or even digital currency.  It mentions a new League of Nations(like the EU) and a new currency(like the Euro).  It’s BS.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:48:25
You need to provide better evidence this is not evidence
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:41:41
Paper Bitcoin?  Where does the actual Bitcoin get settled if at all??
@_date: 2019-04-01 10:00:55
If he really controlled that much bitcoin he would be falling over himself trying to prove it to the world so we would all take him seriously.  He has a huge ego and proving it would be easy so he would have done it long ago.

Lamination is fine as long as it’s not thermal paper.  I still have things I’ve laminated 30 years ago.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:43:41
There is large crossover of people who want to change the world in the two groups.  Everyone I know who is into crypto also has or wants a Tesla.
@_date: 2019-06-05 16:59:41
There are no public keys associated with Satoshi except the genesis block that was hard coded by Satoshi.  That is the only key acceptable as proof.
There’s the keys from the first bitcoin transaction with Hal but we don’t know how those keys have been exposed.

Oh my.  It was Spartacus.

It would help to learn about a subject before you tried lying about it.

I found the TX and I think you’re lying.

Compare the address you sent to with Coinbase with your wallets address to make sure they are the same.  There is malware that will replace your address with theirs when you cut and paste.

WTF is with the picture.

Probably a troll.

Pretty sure a company can’t compel its employees to not invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:04:38
You are correct.  There’s also too much trust involved in a crypto backed by gold.  It’s ripe for a ponzi situation because you can’t audit the supply.
@_date: 2019-05-09 20:52:18
You are high.  The people supporting and innovating crypto in the USA are overwhelmingly liberal.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:43:42


No USD is taken out of circulation.  Fiat is destroyed and replaced by new bills and that is why most fiat money printed is replacing destroyed old bills.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:56:40
Where can we watch?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:22:23
Yes.  Be your own bank.

You just signed up and have no history with them, they owe you nothing.  Your limits will increase automatically the more you use them and establish trust.

Everyone I hate has no clue about bitcoin and it is glorious.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:16:51
There is a physical bitcoins maker who mines BTC directly to the coins address.  I forget the maker but someone here might know.  I’ve seen them on eBay.

That guy is fucking dumb.  Bitch is going to take the money and his kid and run.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:39:21
She’s going to take the money and run off with the kid.  She can’t legally sell her kid and the dumbass admits she doesn’t want him in the kids life.

They don’t really gain anything and most people hold and don’t spend their bitcoins.  And why would eBay add Bitcoin before PayPal?  It doesn’t make sense.

The very first thing you need to do is stop using Citi.  Find a credit union.

Your goal right now should be to get above 1BTC while it is still in reach.  There will come a day when only wealthy people own at least 1BTC.

If someone pays you with coins mixed with stolen bitcoins and miners decide to take it back you’re cool with that?  I doubt it.

It undermines the expectation that the blockchain is immutable.  It technically still is even if they undo a transaction in a later block but it still goes against expectations that have been built over a decade.

Of course a TD poster is going to have a problem with the truth.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:28:33
This!  If you’re broke, figure out how much you spend per month on vices and entertainment and quit them so you can put that money into bitcoin in hopes it pays off in the future.
The person who got me into bitcoin quit smoking in 2013 and started putting that money into bitcoin every month, it was around 300 a month.  He took off to travel internationally a year ago and I haven’t seen him since.  I’m not too far behind him.

It’s not hard to change a coin nobody uses.
