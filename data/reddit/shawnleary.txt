yea but in terms of world adoption, the more the powers at be, don't allow exchange to fiat, the more apt businesses will be to have to hold BTC and then have to transact in it with their partners.  It will boost the network effect on the B2B side.  the best way for government to slow it down is to actually adopt and accept it as quickly as possible and make it seems like it's not big deal.

everything up to 10,000 I use Satoshi's, just easier.  Then for tenths I just say a "tenth of a bitcoin," or "seven tenths of a bitcoin."
its the "centi-bitcoin" that i get stuck at.  
millibitcoin doesn't really roll off the tongue either.  8 millibitcoins? 
maybe we should name each decimal place in honor of the pioneers of btc.   10 Satoshis equals 1 Gavin.  100 Satoshi or 10 Gavins equals 1 SIPA.  1000 Satoshi or 100 Gavins or 10 Sipas equals 1 Gmax, and so on.

I agree, microdonations for charities is huge!  I remember kids used to collect dimes for the "march of dimes" in little cans.  There is no way to really make that kind of collection anymore with fiat or credit cards.   bitcoin and cryptocurrency allow for crowd sourced microdonations to be made.  a new orphanage in India is probably like $5-6k brand new.  That's like change we find on the ground at a gas station and don't even pick up.   BitCoin changes all that and puts every "cent" into play!  :D

@_date: 2014-07-10 16:52:36
My point is there is a chance that this could all happen.  If it can go from zero to $650 in four years, anything is possible.  I would predict there would be a tipping point in which we see governments attempt to clone BTC or whatever crypto makes it to the point of threatening collapse of the current systems.  If it happens slow enough, it might actually not be that painful.  The cat is out of the bag, and whether we like it or not, fiat is doomed, period.  It's not going away anytime soon, it will be kept around like the Queen and the Lincoln Penny as a vestige of yesteryear.

I guess a better question would be, if LINUX was started as an open source project with issued shares?  There would be additional motivation for the developers to contribute other than just doing good for mankind.  Of course we can't pay each other in shares of Apple, but technically we could, if someone wanted to build a system that allowed it.  The regulations behind the stock market would probably prevent it from happening.   
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:18:17

@_date: 2014-06-05 23:28:30
Again, my point is, Bitcoin needs competition.  Its a natural progression of technology. I love bitcoin and want it to succeed but the circle J of this post is amazingly blind.  Many are pump and dumps but the tech being put forward COULD be adopted by Bitcoin, and if it isn't and its something the people want, bitcoin will be left in its dust.

yep, based on absolutely nothing.  The next big rise, if it mimics the previous ones, is, in my estimating going to get it to 4-5k and then it will crash again and everyone who bought at $2,500 will be pissed when it settles back down at $1200 later next year.  Then the next bubble will grow in 2016 and will reach $8,000 at the halving.  heard if here first :)

Are you able to understand the underlying technology and not discuss the price?  the math is pretty solid there, don't think it's going away anytime soon. it may not be called bitcoin but cryptocurrency isn't going away.  it's not to say the government won't try to clone it at some point.  I am almost certain they will.

All I had was a link to the meet-up, no other fluff, even using my real name as the poster, and he said I am searching for "investment partners in risky trading schemes."  
Its just frustrating knowing that the first bitcoin purchase in the world was here in Jacksonville and trying to post a meet-up link gets yanked on reddit.

If you overlay the last two bubbles over the current, they line up fairly well IMO.   We should see a continued 5-6 months of stable 400-600 range and then when Amazon begins to accept it next March it goes bananas again.  If bitcoin does become our one world currency, it's going to have to scale up rather violently over the coming decade.  making some people very rich and leaving others heart broken for a year or two as they buy at a peak.  or it could all go to zero, obviously.

Hate to be negative, but this article promotes all that is wrong in this "space."  I don't even know where to start, but when I read this, I don't see the need or efficiency gain using a Blockchain.
