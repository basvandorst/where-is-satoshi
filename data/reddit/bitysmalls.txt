Saying that one of the greatest financial innovations of our time was helped along by this POS is an insult. Satoshi would bitch slap you..

You sound a bit salty there mate, glad to see your gold investment is going so well for you that you can afford to troll on reddit :)

While I do hope that he is right, one has to question the usefulness of making such predictions? Everyone knows it's almost as accurate as palm reading. 
What I would prefer to see is an analysis of larger adoption and potential technological developments. These are far more relevant IMO

Ahhh, so in US one can buy an AR15 but I can't touch a digital token. 
Sounds sensible to me...

While the mainstream media is pushing this with the "FUD" narrative, I for one, am glad. 
No longer do we have that questionable ICO or scammy broker appearing for a search on "Bitcoin". No longer will one have to dodge blatant phishing links trying to impersonate legitimate sites. 
All together, great result for the long term health of the cryptocurrency market.

Not a Bannon fan, but can't argue with his logic here. Good to see that people understand the potential of crypto to give personal liberty back to the HODLer.

Countries in Africa are ripe for crypto. People are inherently sceptical of the volatile currencies and erratic monetary policy. Even in SA which has the most developed economy on the continent, people are enamoured by Bitcoin. There is a reason that google trends showed the most searched per capita for "Bitcoin" globally was in South Africa. Moreover, its an easy way for those in SA to "internationalise" their savings without going through onerous central bank restrictions on buying dollars.

Think so but this is like a completely new country in a contests border region between Serbia and Slovenia. lol

Yeah, think so. They have been trying to get it off the ground for some time. Think Puerto Rico just best option for US citizens. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:32:18
Yeah. They have had many issues in the past. What are you using?

Haha I was being sarcastic. No list and no grudges. I'm happy with my investment, my returns and my belief in crypto. I pity their jealousy

Bitcoin shorters should know better. Don't short sell the future

Waaay off the mark. 
According to my advanced statistical analysis it will hit $247,564 by Dec 16 2021.
