Waves.  Bitcoin is pushing ashore in waves until all the land is flooded.

Yeah...how's the inflation going for you.  By the time you send it the value of your money has already deflated by about the same percentage.

Say you own a bitcoin but you have to eat.  You would like the value of that bitcoin to rise.  You could spend fiat on that Subway sandwich and do nothing to increase the value of your bitcoin or you could spend more money on bitcoin, buy the Subway sandwich with it, support the growing bitcoin economy and increase the value of your saved bitcoin.

I don't see why this can also use bitcoins.  It's a great thing.

Wealthy bitcoiners cannot print more money for themselves or give out their buddies loans they never have to pay back.
In a bitcoin world, to maintain your wealth, you must provide valid services to mankind.

Stop giving a shit what he thinks of you and he will respect you more.
Buy him a bitcoin or a fraction of it, print it out on a nice paper wallet like at bitaddress.org and tell him to watch it's value each week in all the major markets at bitcoinaverage.com.

It's not as though speculation itself is not a huge market.  Speculation is great.  
Do you know the HUGE ass potential this particular speculation is?  If this works, it will likely have as big an effect on the world as the Internet--maybe bigger.  That is HUGE.
Speculation comes first and is very, very important.

I'm going to tell you something that will be downvoted like hell but mining bitcoin and even litecoin is reasonably expensive now.  
Go to gldtalk.org and they'll tell you how to mine GoldCoin.  The coin is a longshot to ever get in the top 10 but they're decent guys over there.
