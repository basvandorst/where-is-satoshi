Here: 
There's no way to prove it's being manipulated just as much as you can't prove it isn't. It's simply my view on the subject.
All things aside, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't buy or sell it. A lot of profit can be made riding the waves.

There is nothing wrong with buying gold. History has proven it. The gold market is manipulated through gold futures right now. Back in 2014, The Reserve Bank of India reported that the ratio of paper claims to gold exceed the amount of gold available for delivery by 93:1. 
If everyone tried converting those futures to physical gold, only 1% of people could actually get their gold. Stop creating gold futures and the price will go up.

I find the Hunt brothers story very interesting when you compare it with the chinese market. Both borrowed heavily to invest and both margin called.

Very well written post. There are definitely differences between the two and cannot be compared outright but both also have some common grounds.

I've been using Cavirtex for the past 2 years and for the most part it's been great. It's excellent for transferring CAD in and out once you have direct deposit setup. As far as a trading engine though, I don't like it. A few things I'd improve:
1. When you buy and sell, the page goes to another page to confirm. The amount in CAD shows 4 decimal places, just round to lowest cent. If my balance in my account is just 0.0001 less than what it calculated the cost of btc would be, I have to go back and change it on the previous page.
2. Show more depth in the order book
3. Add a price chart or link to a website that has one

Looks like a poorly coded bot. At the exact same time, LTC was sold for USD, BTC sold for USD, and BTC sold for LTC. This happened several months ago when a bot was stuck in a loop. It went from USD -&gt; BTC -&gt; LTC -&gt; USD continuously making a trade every 2-3 min lasting a couple hours. Someone lost a lot of money.

Success to predictions:
1. Be as vague as possible
2. Make thousands of predictions
3. Waite and eventually some of those predictions will be applied to future events

You're right, my mistake. The point I'm making though is the market can be easily manipulated through futures contracts.

I agree this seems like way too many steps. In Canada, a verified cheque would've worked great. I sold my car for cash a few years back and had it deposited in my account directly. If you tell your bank you need a temporary limit increase it usually isn't a problem. While BTC is a lot quicker in this case, it seems like the banking system that was used was extra inefficient than usual.
