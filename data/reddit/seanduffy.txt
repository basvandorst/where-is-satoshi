I'm just a little confused at the wording you used in your post, who did you direct to Gemini? And why weren't they interested? Surely if you're paid in crypto it's you that needs the exchange account for cashing out into fiat, not anybody else.

You can already do that with localbitcoins.

This definitely isn't "The very first UK Bitcoin robbery", I've seen a few stories on here of people being robbed during in-person localbitcoins transactions.

Why do you need to get an exchange involved to get paid in crypto? All your employer needs is your wallet address.

I understood it when BTC was $3 and I still didn't invest. Back then the news was "Bitcoin is no good now because you can't make money mining it on your PC".

What? You were meeting a guy to buy rocking chairs with bitcoin?

You said it there yourself. The price is determined by the emotions and opinions of those who participate in trading it, the same as stocks or any other asset.
There is nothing about the valuation of bitcoin that makes it any different from other instruments, it can just as easily be overvalued.

Oh damn, that sucks, sorry to hear that. I guess we need to treat bitcoin wallets just like cash in normal wallets, only carry what you need.

Yeah but Venmo is a "middle man" as you say. Right now there are hundreds of different ways for you to transfer money to someone freely and and all of them are at least 10x more convenient than any cryptocurrency. But none of them are decentralised and trustless, which is where blockchain comes in. If you aren't interested in those aspects, crypto isn't for you.

Very different because a bank account is associated with an identity, if someone gets into your online banking and steals your money, your bank will most likely find out and get your money back to you. With bitcoin, if somebody else gets hold of your keys, that's the end.

The technology is still in its very early stages and the people who are in it right now are those who are willing to accept the inconvenience in order to try something new. That and people who heard about the hype and want to make themselves some money.
Only when using a crypto wallet becomes as easy as using FIAT can we expect to begin seeing mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:28:43
Yeah, that’s possible too. Either way, this fantasy of bitcoin somehow being perfectly rationally valued has no truth to it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:44:15
Not too long ago the fees were pennies, Bitcoin hasn't scaled well which has resulted in the now outrageous fees, making it unviable as a currency. There are now better cryptocurrencies out there which improve on the idea of bitcoin and offer very low fees.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:14:47
I'm not a salesperson.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:41:56
Yes, but you said that bitcoin couldn’t collapse because it’s valuation is based on its merit as a technology. This isn’t true, if people stop using it or take a disliking to it for some reason, it’s price could collapse.

Sorry if it seems harsh but a huge amount of the info on this poster is either false or only applies in the US.


This definitely isn't always true as we all know, it can take hours or days if you mess up.


Again clearly not true, tell that to the people who paid $25 fees on $20 transfers in December.


Huge generalisation, many kinds of fiat transactions don't allow "chargebacks", for example cash transactions.






Oh, so like a four digit code I can memorise? Cool.


Again with the fee thing, and what credit card fees? I definitely don't get charged when using my credit card, that would be insanity.
It's a nice idea but bitcoin isn't easy to understand for the average person and misinformation is only going to make things even worse.

Right, if OP had just shot the robbers dead instead of letting them get away with the cash, he'd be in a much better position right now. Oh wait no, he'd probably still be out of pocket and also be potentially facing a murder charge.

For a subway system in a busy city it just isn't realistic at all, there's no way you can cope with this kind of demand with anything but a digital smart card based system.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:44:16
Would that have changed anything in this scenario though? Would the thieves believe you when you said you had the money in a deposit box and just admitted defeat and left?
Somehow I don’t think so. From a violent robbery point of view, having your coins in a secure location is no more secure than just lying and claiming they’re in a secure location. Unless your dealing with very trusting thieves, it’s pretty useless. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:17:37
As opposed to what, running the entire subway network on hand-stamped paper tickets?
