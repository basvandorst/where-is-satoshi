@_date: 2018-01-19 06:18:20
The same can be said of any asset whatsoever.
Edit: Your point makes no sense anyways. When property is shifted from a seller to a buyer there is no ownership over the exchanged asset. The transaction is complete.
You are probably referring to a system such as fiat currency in which new money is printed thus diluting the supply and taking value from all who own the asset to begin with. That is more like a pyramid scheme.

Insider trading is trading on privileged information. 
Shares of a company are worth more to shareholders that have privileged insider information than they are to those without it.
Insider trading should NOT be illegal, but it SHOULD be illegal to market a product fraudulently. 
Ideally, insider trading should be assumed to be taking place in all markets unless otherwise stated.
Consumers will naturally prefer owning shares of a company/asset that agrees to provide a standard of disallowing owners from trading using privileged/insider information.
Companies that wish to offer shares of ownership that are fungibly equitable to all participants may market the shares as such and thereby be held legally responsible for such claims.
A company may limit such liability by requiring contracts to be agreed to prior to entering ownership of a share. Shareholders to be would be required to agree to uphold the ethical parameters set by the contract or be held legally responsible for fraud.
Alternately, everybody could wake up and realize that mathematical anonymity is possible and will be utilized by individuals with privileged information.
Whether it is an algo trading on natural language processing that gives it an edge against humans when trading based on news, or the CEO of a company sending encrypted messages to decentralized token markets that allow anonymous trading, shorting, leverage, futures markets.
Eventually regulation will be impossible to enforce, so it is time to get real and think about how to perform in a future that looks very different.

"Insider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company.

It is useful in this instance to understand that there is no "company" that sells shares, only owners of shares that sell stakes in a company to other owners to be. 
In this sense there is no secondary market. 
It is possible to loan, rent, borrow shares, but then the owner ought to take on the legal onus of the actions of their clients, or require that they agree to behave according to the same contractual obligations that an owner must.

So, basically, because the investors take an active role in promoting the investment it is multi level marketing? I still am not making the connection.
You state that MLM isn't a technical term. According to wikipedia "Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they personally generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit. This recruited sales force is referred to as the participant's "downline", and can provide multiple levels of compensation."
Based on that I just don't see it. Just because something is not a technical term does not mean an arbitrary interpretation is justified.
I think it is this component of MLM that more clearly matches up: 
"cult-like techniques which some groups use to enhance their members' enthusiasm and devotion."
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:27:40
Liquidity and "market cap" are correlated in the same manner supply and demand are correlated as a function of price. 
The more consistently the supply and demand function in equilibrium, the less volatility there will be and the more functional bitcoin will be for transactions of a specific volume.
If the volume exceeds liquidity you will see volatility in either direction.
It is better to look at market cap in relationship to volatility in order to gauge liquidity and function.
For instance, it would have a greater impact on the dogecoin market to liquidate a "tesla" worth of dogecoin than it would to do the same with bitcoin on the bitcoin market.
The demand for dogecoin at a given price is less than that of bitcoin. This is known as the depth of a market.
The depth of a market is related to market cap, but not in a vacuum. In other words the functionality of the bitcoin economy is relative.

Why isn't Satoshi Nakamoto touching the coins that represent such a large percent of the coins in existence?
Wouldn't it make sense to take some profits along rhe way?
It might also bolster the value of the commodicurrency as it would alleviate concerns over concentration of wealth and thus power to debase the value of bitcoin via flooding the market.
I acknowledge that an entity concerned with conserving the value of their property has a vested interest in avoiding actions that would devalue it. But, in reality, the identity of said entity (Satoshi Nakamoto) remains unknown.
Here is a conspiracy theory that may have been discussed already that I would simply like to adress as a hypothetical:
What is to stop an existing institution from identifying a technology that has disruptive potential and marrying it early on with malificent intentions. They foster said instrument and allow it to grow into an entity that appears to be a direct threat.
Next, when the time is right and public perception of the new paradigm has become adequately widespread and positive, they begin to dismantle it. They flood the market suddenly, causing a bubble burst scenario. This would indefinitely, damage the reputation of decentralized currencies.
This action might be followed up with the introduction of a bug in the protocol as a coup de gras.

Logic checks out, except that during the "China bubble" there has been continuous development of infrastructure surrounding the protocol adding real value.

This should result in the price floor being higher than that of the pre China phenomenon.

The American dollar is, in fact, infinitely divisible as well. However, this is not what makes fiat an inflationary currency. It is the fact that the buying power of one dollar decreases when more dollars are introduced to the system.
If there were another unit of divisibility in the bitcoin protocol 1 satoshi would still have exactly the same buying power because no new bitcoins have been introduced to the system.

The only issue I see with your reasoning is confusing the word bitcoin with the word cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency like blue is a color. However, color is not a blue.
Altcoins do not add or subtract from tje scarcity of bitcoin, they add and subtract from the scarcity of cryptocurrencies.
Just as discovering that a new color exists does not subtract from how abundant any other wavelength of light is.
There is still just as much blue, but now we know ther is also a new color that nobody knew about before.

I agree that the public perception of bitcoin leaves something to be desired by those who would like to see its success. 
I also question the rational that marketing ought to be crowdfunded.
Interestingly, the cost of marketing is built not only into the everyday products that we buy, but also affects shareholders of stock as it is an expense, obviously offset depending upon the success of the marketing campaign.
It is my sentiment that the marketing of bitcoin should be handled primarily by the companies who stand to make money from it succeeding.

Bitcoin has garnered repeated regulatory action from Chinese officials; meetings held. Why have they been wasting valuable time on something you deem "insubstantial"?
It is not the money that they are interested in (although some are making a killing) but rather it is the potential that decentralized currencies hold.
This is Chinas method of destabilizing a burgeoning disruptive force. They are systematically undermining the faith and trust that are so vital to bitcoins success.
If China had initially all out banned bitcoin it may have risen from the ashes atronger than ever. But instead, by continually enforcing an atmosphere of uncertainty, China is instiling a higher degree of volatility while simultaneously buying time with which to study the phenomenon.

They may never admit they were wrong even if bitcoin is wildly successful. 
Value is inherently subjective. It is a reflection of supply which is objective and demand that is generated from subjective entities. 
As such, demand is subject to the ebbs and flows of the cultural zeitgeist. 
As this is an ever-changing phenomenon one may deduce that there is no such thing as intrinsic value and it follows that the values that we bestow upon goods and services are all "bubbles."

Now China must continue to stymie growth in this space because the original regulations were geared towards currencies with central issuers (blizzard creates WOW gold). The issuers are responsible for complying with the regulations.

Regardless of whether or not you understand the transaction that occurred (in which an individual spent bitcoins and recieved a Tesla) to be someone "buying a tesla with bitcoins", this same "transaction" (purchase) is not currently feasible with the alt coins that you claim to "work the same as altcoins."
It would currently be impossible to arrange a transaction in which an individual exchanges an alt coin and receives a Tesla (buys a tesla with altcoins) without crashing the value of the altcoin. 
The reason why the value would crash is because, at present, the market is too small to handle the immediate liquidation of the altcoin for cash that would result from the transaction.
Bitcoin works differently from altcoins in that it can handle such liquidation without suffering the immediate effects of volatility that alts would.
There is utility in liquidity that altcoins lack, thus making the functional utility of altcoins inferior.

 without annihilating the supply will keep the price from jumping up too quickly. It will also reduce volatility, thus strengthening the usefullness as a currency.
Additionally large lump purchases are likely transacted off exchange, thus having an apparent delayed effect on price.

I am not so sure. Average Joe Schmoe heard about bitcoin during the media frenzy correlated with ATH in November. He has since seen nothing but price depreciation since then.
Average JS is thinking "obvious bubble, LOL bagholders, pyramid etc."
1-2 years ago JS had not even heard of bitcoin. The only group that knew about it were tech savvy individuals who were more likely to pursue an intellectual understanding of what bitcoin really is.
Today JS is dismissing it as whatever the first two lines of a shitheaded mainstream media article paints it to be. i.e. Ponzi, pyramid, etc, words that do not make sense when applied to bitcoin. People just use those words because they are parrots.

There can be infinite crypto currencies but that does not effect the scarcity of bitcoin. No matter how many currencies exist there will only ever be 21000000 bitcoins. And nobody will ever pay attention to the worthless basket of thousands and thousands of copy cats.
You seem to believe that if somebody invents another currency it automatically reduces demand for bitcoin. It seems like a silly assumption.
It is more likely that more currencies dilute the market for tiny startup currencies.
There is a niche of individuals looking for the next shiny new altcoin. They have tiny market caps that are dwarfed only by the attention spans of the investors in the niche market.
As soon as the next best altcoin comes along these individuals must have a piece of the action and before long their whole portfolio consists of tiny stakes in floundering altcoins, none of which have any hope of catching on because nobody in this niche circle believes in any one coin enough to commit.
What you end up with is a bunch of diluted currencies that only appeal to a tiny group of people with increasingly thin stakes in each one. 
On the other hand there is bitcoin. It has a following that believes that the network effect is self fulfilling and exponential and thus continue to invest ever more into it thus maintaining its demand and position as the most valuable coin.

We have millions upon millions of capital flooding in to fill the vacuum that illegitimate exchanges leave. New exchanges will put old ones out of business because the new ones will be operated from legitimate spaces where there will be legal accountability.

What he states is undeniably correct. What he failed to add is context. The trend on the three day chart is the most obvious gauge of what to expect from future price movement. It is a solid 4+ month long downturn with a clear trendline.
However, he provides almost no context for his comment which actually addresses another chart altogether; one that actually has candles.
Because he does not clearly connect his comment to OP's content and references charts without linking or clear analysis he earns my downvote. 
His comment is straight up lazy. Then again so is OP's analysis.

You're not convincing anyone
But whatever, keep going on with your conspiracies and how big banks are afraid of you and how there's a paid FUD campaign or whatever. Reality will smash your illusions in the end.
This is actually a glimpse into how bitcoin is perceived by a vast number of people in the general public.
The vitriol is palpable, no?
This is bitcoins biggest hurdle. People hate bitcoin. Public sentiment is straight up resentful.
You might ask, "Why would anybody actively despise bitcoin, what has bitcoin done to them?"
I too am curious why.
I believe that people look for opportunities to revel in the misfortune of others, particularly when it reflects the validity of their own judgements. 
Be honest, on the face of it bitcoin looks like a giant scam. Common sense screams "scam". And people cant help but use things they perceive as gauges of common sense as weapons against the intellect of others.
These are people with low self esteem. They are afraid to take risks. When their fear is validated they gloat over that which had become a potential source of humiliation.

Do you mean to ask why people judge the actions of others? A topic to which you will find many answers from a range of disciplines.
One common reason is that judging the actions of others creates a sense of comradery. People can get together and say and think "we're better than that". We would never commit atrocious acts like (fill in the blank) hitler, general sheridan, aztec priest... you get the point.

Heres an unpopular proposition, coming from genuine curiosity and an open mind. 
Given that the 1% are bye and large the greatest beneficiaries of the fed inflationary monetary policy, ie. closest to the "spigget," and that the US is profiting immensely through printing money at the expense of those who use it as a reserve currency, would it not make sense for its citizens to seek to disproportionately tax the 1% and even out the spread?

I don't understand what you are getting at. In your example one must have US dollars but it is not necessary to own Bitcoin. So which has a more objectively necessary utility? It seems obvious that the answer is the US dollar. Unless you wish to have a discussion about what the word value entails.

In other words the value is at worst retained by it's use as a "stay out of jail card".
Do you value your freedom? Then you value the dollar.
This can be extrapolated to international sovereigns such as ghadafi who attempted to refuse to sell oil for dollars and subsequently saw the consequences.

Actually, fiat serves as an ongoing sustained ponzi scheme reinforced by the threat of violence in the form of state intervention should a participant later choose to opt out by way of not paying taxes.
The ponzi is thus: The money printers give new shares of the ponzi to a select few. Those who first receive the newly printed shares enjoy the greatest value from further selling the shares. The shares are ultimately diluted into the global pool having lost the majority of their value by the time they reach the lowest members of the wrung e.g. inflation.

Ok. That is fine, but there is no standardized terminal for customers to interact with. There needs to be a qr, NFC, text address blue tooth. Whatever in addition to a display that shows the Fiat amount and the crypto amount. So... Hardware. And software. Simple stuff but some company should standardize the customer facing component so that customers have a payment station that they are familiar with and makes the process as seamless as possible.

They do not care about bad guys exploiting back doors to systems in use by the general public. 
This is not about being able to identify and prevent specific incidences.
They want to be able to forecast society like the weather.
In doing this they can better control future movements through marketing and propaganda and assassination.
If everybody uses strong encryption then it severely limits their ability to forecast because it limits the information they have for projecting.

My keep key has been a joy with the exception that I created an outgoing transaction recently for a small amount and when I looked at my balance a much larger amount had been removed. I looked at transaction histories an the correct amount was removed, but it gave me a scare. I fervently checked that I hadn't released the wrong amount. 
Some time later my shown balance displayed the correct amount.

I have read every thread looking for some semblance of a response to Stolfi's arguments and the best yet mentioned has been that his argument could similarly be applied to gold. It may be true that the Stolfi's arguments are similarly applicable to gold, but this makes them no less true.

I have had nothing but positive experiences with purse.io. I have saved a ton of money, with the exception of having been scammed by one user who sold me e-gift cards that were stolen or something. I received no compensation as gift cards are not protected through purse. Lesson learned.
This is speaking from a user of the service who has not participated in the earner side of the site. 
Love this service and hope to see it thrive well into the future.
