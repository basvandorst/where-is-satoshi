Well I'm looking for some big tippers to help me out. I've been stuck in between a rock &amp; a hard place.  I'm a graphic artist that is looking for work, but Sadly no go.  I'm looking to get a couple of bitcoins to help me out.
Here's my address: 1KYJXpc2w1gDyNkH6rXPcmcogMo2XBr4Lv
Also, here's my digital portfolio:

You're right! It's so mediocre that people have legitimately bought my t-shirt designs &amp; asked me to make Album art for them. Like I said before, beauty is only in the eye of the beholder.  I cannot change your mind. You do not represent all of Reddit since you're only one person.

Except I wasn't being the asshole in the first place. You are being a scumbag to begin with.

TIL there really isn't nice people on reddit at all like reddit claims. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:00:09
Yes.... All 200 of them felt sorry for me.  You're an idiot.

Then I must be doing something wrong here. How does one get a bitcoin? My laptop is not good enough to mine.

Yeah, since we're on Do you give women shit who show their tits to get bitcoins over at It's the same equivalent.

You are respectfully entitled to your opinions, but I believe your opinion is utter shit, because you have not heard of the saying , "Beauty is only in the eye of the beholder."  If white paintings to a picture of a brick in a toilet can be art then I don't know what is.

TIL there are assholes who are rude to assholes on reddit.  Thanks. I'm glad you like to piss in an ocean of piss.

Because the Government who run taxes end up misusing your taxes.
