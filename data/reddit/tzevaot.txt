The Hang is made by a different company. We have developed our own unique processes to make our instruments warm and resonating

Could you please rephrase the question? The video is me playing, I'm not the best but I try and let you guys have any idea of the raw instrument. I am working to get into a studio with few artists to put out a nice edited video soon though :)

Around 3 weeks. Each instrument needs to be heat treated several times and tuned and fine tuned so that it will last for a long time to come.

Price is $1800 USD+shipping(unless you can come pick it up in socal) or whatever that is in BTC

Thanks! Each one is handmade so a lot of hardwork goes into each and every instrument. It takes upwards of 3 weeks to make each instrument, going through several stages of tuning and heat treatments(annealing) to get the instrument to hold the tuning for a long time. Each one I ended up calculating travels 28,000 miles just between all our facilities to get proper treatments and processes for the proper sound.

Yup, here are a few popular ones:
Akebono (for those who really enjoy the mysterious sound): 
Aeolian: A bit of mystere, with a brighter side to it: 
Hijaz: Middle-eastern scale, a very dark beauty:

Considering keeping it in coin for aslong as possible, but thankyou. Been using Coinbase so far, have a few BTC, and some litecoin as well. Will check out their merchant side.

Oh that's how long it takes each one to be made. We are still new and getting the word out--we have up to 3-5 months waiting time for specific scales. We like to do things on a first come first serve basis so whenever I receive a batch of instruments I will make an announcement and everyone has a chance to get one. 
So right now I have 2 instruments available and Reddit has been good to us in the past :)

There's nothing on it, but  
I just load up all the videos onto our youtube and if you are interested in buying/more info you can just e-mail me at teddy
Edit: I feel so ill-mannered, apologies. Thank you for your compliments :) Is this your first time hearing this instrument?

Still figuring out conversion to Bitcoin(fairly new to it, even though I've been looking into it for the past 2 years). Any tips on processing is greatly appreciated.
