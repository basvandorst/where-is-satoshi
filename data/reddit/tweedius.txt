The arguments presented in this post are that of an extremist and ideological purist.  You can't just switch the way the world works without the good work of companies like coinbase moving the thing forward one iteration and win at a time.  
**I totally disagree with your point and believe your arguments are aimed at friends of bitcoin when they should be aimed at foes.**

The 51% attack by the US has always been my biggest fear.  They could easily do it and if the $ is ever in (serious) trouble would certainly have the motivation.  I don't know why that kind of thing hasn't been addressed yet, now is the time for them to act while bitcoin is still relatively small.

I know exactly what this guy is going through as I got in on gold at the very wrong time and second guessed my position.  However, I learned from that mistake and waited to enter this market until it is where it is right now.  Right now is the time for a value investment and riding it out until it swings up again.
What really makes this market suffer is basically Mt Gox.  All I hear from the more financially savvy colleagues at work whenever I talk to them about bitcoin is Mt Gox (and these aren't college kids, they are D level and business development folks).  Until confidence can be inspired in the "lay man" bitcoin will not hit the next upswing that everyone is waiting for.
Back to the point of this post though.  He got in at the wrong time.  He doesn't have any patience and bitcoin was probably the wrong investment for him.  He probably should have put his money in the stock market as it is definitely going up right now.

I like Mike Hearn, I think he served a great purpose to Bitcoin by posting what he did yesterday.
However, my first instinct was the same as yours.  The blog post was meant to serve two purposes.  I'd say that it probably worked for both of those purposes.
1) It seems to have served as a catalyst for the Bitcoin community to get its shit together.
2) It probably did a favor to whatever group he is now a part of as well.
After reflection I think that overall everything will be better now that he posted that (as long as Bitcoin Classic moves forward like it looks like it is going to), but unfortunately nothing Mike says about Bitcoin will ever mean as much again, he used up the remaining capital he had all at once last night.

Sure, but what you're missing in that argument is that there are all sorts of easy to use applications developed for those tasks.  Outlook, gmail, etc take care of all of the email functionality you just described.
Bitcoin does not have this, it has weird QC codes and weird numbers and letters to deal with.  If web pages or for your use case email addresses could only be accessed from IP addresses I don't think either would have as much widespread adoption as they do today.

Blockstream stands to benefit from the blocks remaining small so that they can monetize their off-chain technology.  Whenever there is opposition to progress, Blockstream is there.  Although now that the debate has turned toward the forking of core vs xt they seem to just want to retain their power (i.e. keep core the main implementation).

There is a large contingent of people who dislike the direction the sub has gone.  Censorship goes against most people's core values and not only annoys them but makes them mad.  They can't just unseat the current mod team but they can downvote anyone that they see as the cause for the unwelcomed change.  This has caused the behavior you are observing and describing.


It seems to be the mod team's right to take the sub off the cliff (my view) because all petitions to the reddit admins have gone unanswered.  It also seems to be the individual user's right to downvote whatever they disagree with.
I can think of a lot of subs approach to moderation that while it annoys people is respected.  The science subreddit heavily moderates the comments so that the discussion sticks to the issue and does not cross into politics, fart jokes, or anything else that doesn't discuss the topic at hand or relevant other topics pertaining to the article/link posted.  A lot of subs have turned off link submissions to prevent people from link karma whoring which cleans up the front page of that sub.
However banning discussion or shoehorning it into one post a day of something you don't like but is VERY relevant to the future of a protocol that is supposed to be the topic of discussion/interest of the sub is going to end up just like this has.  Petty attacks on both sides.  To me it appears that the mod team is trying to pick the winner rather than let an open discussion take place.
This is all your prerogative, but downvoting whatever I want is certainly mine.
I am inconsequential, I haven't left (I keep hoping the mod team will see the error in their ways rather than dig their heels in in a fit), but I do hope that one of the other bitcoin subs takes off if this place does not get its act together and stop with this.  There is a reason that all of this hate is being spewed towards the mods and others getting downvoted, people don't like your rules.

I think this is the key area where I disagree with you.  I won't say for sure but it would also appear that the loud minority of the community disagrees.  I don't think anyone asked you guys to enforce the consensus rules.  I don't think anyone wants you guys to enforce the consensus rules.
I think people want a central place to discuss all things bitcoin popular or not.  Any attempt by the mod team to enforce arbitrary rules that no one wants is going to be met, unfortunately, by the opposition you are seeing.
If you want to try to silence (or shoehorn) discussion you're going to be met with opposition, it goes against human nature to think otherwise.
As far as the silly "I WAS BANNED FROM threads, those are just idiotic and any rational person can see right through them.  If it makes you feel better I actively downvote those posts as well.
I guess I'm not trying to be confrontational, but this whole debate and the way it is being handled has driven me to stop checking as much for sure.  I still come back obviously, but it is vexing, terribly vexing.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:41:29


As a project manager type who has to manage these kinds of debates and ultimately make decisions I think this is one of two root causes of the direction this subreddit and the overall debate is going from an emotional standpoint. 
The other root cause of a lot of hate the core devs are receiving from a technical standpoint is the fact that increasing the blocksize by changing the variable to a higher number is something anyone that doesn't have a programming background can get their head around and it seems like an obvious solution.
@_date: 2015-10-18 15:40:08

First of all, thank you for a thoughtful response.  I just have a couple responses to your comments.


I'm sure it is, but just knowing human nature this sounds like a lot more work than people are probably willing to do.  It really isn't the simplest answer, but we can disagree on that.


I think this sub would return to somewhat of a stable place if the censorship of xt was lifted.  You can call the "censorship" whatever you want but in a lot of people's minds that is what it is and this is based on multiple comments from multiple sources respected or average like me.
Unfortunately, due to the people involved in the blocksize debate, until the issue is resolved the tension won't go away but maybe we can all be friends again and just disagree rather than hating each other.

That is because Coinbase has now come out for BIP101.  Coinbase is a huge stakeholder and a potential customer of what Blockstream envisions for bitcoin.  That is why you saw Theymos go apeshit in the thread about it and why all the Blockstream folks are out in force.  
Coinbase adopting BIP101 would be a game changer for the smallblockers.

"Sockpuppets" or alternate accounts that are made to skew votes in favor of one person or another are clearly against the reddit sitewide TOS and actively banned by the reddit admins.  It is why unidan was banned.
