Why would I pre-pay 12 months when I can enjoy my gains in crypto instead

Bitcoin is a store of value. It's shit at everything else. If for example litecoin was accepted with 2 minute transfer time and cents in transfer fees this post would make sense. Paying small amounts with bitcoin is stupid.

why buy food when you can starve and be rich when you're dead

I know segwit is better, but coinbase/gdax don't support LTC segwit adresses, I couldnt withdraw to a segwit adress. Could the same be happening to btc?

As far as I'm aware, you can't put a sell order below the average market price on GDAX. At least it didn't let me do it no matter what.

Good luck paying double for your haircut now

I was just looking up how long it takes for coinbase to send the LTC to my ledger :/

If the world goes to shit you want to own as much bitcoin as you can, and as little fiat as possible. Look at venezuela where it already happened.
You can also buy a LOT of things with bitcoin.

Same, I always get bored of my money increasing in value
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:12:47
By your logic gold would also have 0 value. In markets supply and demand create the price. There is only a limited amount of BTC, which is 21 million. No more.

After the wave washes over everyone will forget it and business will continue as usual.. remember the american airlines doctor incident? Guess who remembers that. The investors don't, that's sure as hell.

how retarded are you that your brain ignores 30% of the monitor screen?

Wait you can do that?

It's only a current loss if you sell it.

Grant Cardone, is that you?
Good writeup btw.

Amazon doesnt, not the seller.

Exactly, this tells us nothing. This is like walking into a makeup store, asking 5 people about their interest in makeup, then concluding that millennials think that makeup is more important than anything in the world.

It's a big change, and people will sell out of fear before it hits.
