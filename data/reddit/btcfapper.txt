Part of me agrees, but part of me is pretty enamored with just how much easier it was to pay. I always spend a lot of time looking for good free porn (which I admit is somewhat of a fun process). But, with this, I just paid $15, and instantly had access to a ton of high-quality stuff - for the next 30 days. It's all DRM free, and I can download all the good stuff for future viewing. Free stuff is so often just low-quality clips, or just a few low-res pictures from a picture set. It's nice to just have easy access to the original source material.

So, pay for a monthly fee for a seedbox? Or, how about instead just pay a monthly fee directly to the content creators, so that they can keep making good stuff.

Supporting things you like isn't really a giant leap backward...

I belong to many private torrent trackers that are dedicated to porn. However, none of them are as organized or convenient as this was. Plus, I didn't have to leave my torrent client seeding after I was done!

Well, one of the downsides of using a throwaway I guess. FWIW, I can tell you that I am genuinely not connected in any way with the site I linked to (other than being a happy customer). I am an avid bitcoin supporter, and I truly think this is one of the next major growth areas for the currency. The same way porn was one of the first major use-cases for the consumer internet, it will be for bitcoin as well.

Haha, now I get it. I was just skimming the first time :)
