Understood. But you will find English spelling errors in virtually every Chinese (origin) website. 
It’s the growth process of a company when the top people hired Mandarin&gt;English vv translators which studied in Asia. 
Even if they’re graduated, Mandarin will be their first tongue and continue to make mistakes. 
That’s not an excuse but my own decades long experience in China. They should improve quickly since there’s money enough. Often it’s done in order to not lose face...and in haste.

Yes, you're right, but I'm hoping for a new development within Blockchain that all these crazy transactions and platforms won't be necessary anymore.

That's because most westerners don't know much about China and are only informed by their regional press and media and most of the time that's one-sided info.
China (government) is VERY careful about ICO's because Chinese people have a tendency of gambling in their blood. Therefore, many many HUGE scams in the financial industry have taken place, way before ICO's came into the picture as an investment possibility. Also: many financial crooks and criminals ended up in jail for life because they "stole" money from innocent and naive believers in pyramid schemes and I'm talking many many $Billions of USDollars. One of those scams lured almost 1 Million (! yes) investors who lost their money..big time and I know because I know of a few people (friends) who lost money in that scam. Just Google "China scams" and you wil find what I mean. "Beijing" is extremely careful about ICO's and doesn't want their naive investor citizens lose their money because it could create an uproar in the streets and that's something Beijing wants to avoid at all times.. That's the MAJOR reason "Beijing" isn't very keen on ICO's but promote Blockchain technology on a gigantic scale with many Billions $'s. ICO's will come one day but with a regulation a-la-Beijing which is lacking in the west..still. 
I think "we" need a sort of regulation also and I mean that with all the best intentions because if we don't have some sort of regulation, many governments will try to stop and regulate "Bitcoin" and the cryptoworld in a way WE don't want them to do. Cheers..UPDATE:
I would like to add that, personally, I see the speech by Xi Jinping as a very positive one for the total Crypto currency future and with a magnitude we can't foresee yet but that it will be of great importance to ALL crypto's and especially for the ones, created by Chinese and in China/Hong Kong/Singapore. It needs time and Chinese always think and act very longterm!

I agree with many points you say. The problem with China is that most of the ignorant people in the west (about China) cannot comprehend their culture. It's extremely complicated and it needs a lot of time before real democracy will set in. But, it's not just China, although the biggest country always gets most attention. The "dictators" are all over South East Asia and beyond: to name a few: Laos, Cambodia, Thailand (yes) Myanmar, Indonesia, Philippines etc. It's not so easy as we think. We are blessed that we live in relatively "free" countries with so called Freedom of Speech but if you look at TRUE freedom of speech in many countries one will be amazed how little real freedom there really is...

I agree with the BTC part. But Western countries/banks did the same in the past. What do you expect? Banks, whether American, European or Asian, do NOT hold full reserves of your hard earned money since your money is their Revenue Model: no money - no bank -  most banks don’t even have 2-5% cash of total clients’ money. That’s why EVERY bank will close doors and IT so that you can’t access your own money anymore. Just to prevent that you will lose ALL of your cash.

"" **Little-known, China arrests core Plus Token team**
*Yet just days after the first reports of faltering withdrawals emerged, June 29th, a perhaps deliberately opaque piece by the South China Morning Post revealed that six Chinese nationals were arrested in Vanuatu by Chinese law enforcement for operating an unnamed “internet scam” from the Pacific island. The article did not disclose further details.
Later, Alibaba-backed Chinese tech news site 36KR would reveal that the six apprehended in Vanuatu were none other than the founding members of the Plus Token team, and that a “person close to the police” put the total amount of crypto misappropriated through the scheme at 20 billion Chinese Yuan (approximately $2.85 billion).
Wan’s estimates, however, may indicate a significantly larger figure if correct. Having reported that up to 200,000 BTC and 800,000 ETH has been traced back to Plus Wallet addresses, Wan would put the total amount of funds “scammed” by Plus Token close to $3.5 billion."" *
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:08:02
This rumor has been going on for some time now. Beijing will NOT lift the ban on ICO's if they're decentralized.
The reason is that they want to prevent large scams since they've had enough of HUGE financial scams in the past few years whereby millions of people lost their assets. Criminals will immediately step in and create vague tokens and rob people of their money. Beijing will NOT accept anything that they can't control and decentralized ICO's belong to that category never mind they promote Blockchain technology on a large scale.

PEOPLE LIKE US....!! The Governments and Banks in our Global society managed to control all citizens throughout the ages via “centralization”. Now, since Bitcoin, people feel “free” for the first time EVER and are able to decide for themselves. That they risk their own cash for REAL freedom says something about the immense pain, caused by these financial chains that they intend to brake down. Isn’t it amazing that there are so many signs, all over the world, coming from the “old” financial powers, creating and challenging crypto coins ? They’re losing control: THANKS TO PEOPLE LIKE US! Let’s stay together instead “pissing” on tokens or coins we don’t have or like. We’re on the same ship �� ALL OF US. STAY PUT!

You’re wrong. That’s not how the Chinese work. They will find the majority of the stolen money, funds and crypto. The top 6 guys were arrested already on June 29th 2019 on the tiny island of Vanuata by a special team from China. That’s where the Ponzi scammers were working from, stealing/fooling small time investors. China will do everything possible to bring the money back to investors. Scammers will face the most severe punishments you can ever imagine! Life in prison is a guarantee and rightfully so!

These scandalous lowlifes mainly steal and lure the money away from retired elderly people who worked their whole life and saved little by little. These guys KNOW they face bitter and horrible consequences. I know...my own FIL was victimized and lost a lot of money. The problem is that these Ponzi groups are very organized and move their “offices” quickly so that people (investors) can’t find them anymore. They “massage” their victims over long periods of time to get their full trust, paying them money back monthly during 3-5 months (with money from other victims. Then they disappear. Their victims are usually people without much knowledge of computers. These lowlifes are scrupulous and have no mercy whatsoever. Very sad story for the victims.

This announcement is not the same as before and it's serious although NOTHING is final in China. 
The enormous waste of energy during mining is a bad thing next to the intentions of the Chinese government to control the crypto industry completely. 
After all, they want to limit or completely stop the flow of money (crypto) out of the country. 
It's extremely difficult for Chinese to invest into the crypto business and some are trying to do so via family or friends outside China or underground at extra costs and fees, which if, of course, tricky.

What most crypto investors don't think about is that it could happen that both partners pass away at the same time (car accident, plane crash etc).

Your comment **Mass adoption requires easy to use front end Crypto is clunky as fuck** is one of the most simple, yet most intelligent answers to the Crypto world and token/coins developers, I've ever read.
Many of the guys here (investing Crypto) are kind of whizzkids who are bright into the IT world and I mean more IT educated than the average Joe, who's sending emails and watching movies and porn. But for the people in the streets, investing in Crypto is pure hell. It's simply too complicated for mass adoption by individuals (not financials or banks) and *itchy-balls* is right when he wrote: *put your mom in front of a computer and you'll see what's wrong*
I'm not a techie but SOMETHING has to be done by all the smart developers to make Crypto really great and simple with double or triple verification for security . Blockchain is the future but that development is created by smart guys and the *Blockchain products* will be used by end-users who wouldn't even know they're using a Blockchain product. But investing in Crypto is not easy and very scary to most users or users-to-be. A lot of my friends won't even touch Crypto since they have ZERO clues HOW to to it and even start. And they do have lots of money but they simply stay in stocks, bonds or real estate. 1 phone call to their stockbroker to buy this or that: job done. NOT WITH CRYPTO.

“Nearly all inflows in Q1 were into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (99%). One possible explanation for this is that Bitcoin found a ‘sweet spot’ with respect to relative risk and return expectations versus other digital assets.”
Bitcoin has outshined its competitors throughout the 2019 cryptocurrency recovery, enabling BTC to surge to its most dominant market position since December 2017. As of the time of writing, bitcoin and its $137.1 billion valuation retained a 60% strangehold on the entire crypto market cap.*

I always advise investors to spread their hard earned money, no matter if little or large sums. I see too many youngsters putting all of their cash into just one coin...didn’t they learn something of successful investors and the King of them all....Warren Buffett? He would NEVER put all of his money in 1 stock. NEVER! Spread is the message.

Apple, Google, Amazon are more positive examples �� there will always be winners and losers. Let’s focus on winners. I’m honest enough to say I won but lost also, quite a bit. But I’m still investing...75 years old and kicking ass enjoying crypto to the fullest.

Thanks. The link doesn’t open. Wonder why..�� but there’s a link to a company named ‘Messari’. Never heard of them but will look into it.

Stocks vs Coins. I like the coin challenge a LOT more than investing in stocks so we agree. But the basics are the same: you invest with fiat/cash and jump in the pool ����‍♀️ hoping for the best. At the moment I also opt for bitcoin. Exciting times ahead and may the best Alts survive...even better:  MY Alts which are still sleeping like a bear �� way down below heavy snow. But they’ll be OK in 1 or 2 years. There’s no other option. Patience prevails  ���� stay safe and wish you good fortune ��

This Ms Eleesa Dadiana is a very rich 30yr old lady from Georgian nobility and is moving in extreme wealthy circles in London (Arabs, Russians, Chinese and others) where billionaires buy her art and she's accepting Bitcoin and Alts as payments for her art and even expensive cars since 2017. That was a smart move!
I tell you, we have no idea how rich her clientele is and it's not a surprise to me that the very wealthy are buying silently into Bitcoin since some time via her Dadiani Syndicate, UK's first luxury-crypto exchange.
To be honest, I don't see billionaires sitting behind their computers themselves but "allow" secretive buyers like Dadiani to buy into Bitcoin/crypto in high volumes.
They hate banks as much as we do and investing in assets like companies, start ups and minerals is a risky business in this era, so they move elsewhere: Bitcoin.
Money is not a problem for these super rich because cash doesn't bring them anything in banks.
Personally, I think this is a very smart move since Ms Adiani built her Art empire around these wealthy individuals and promotes Bitcoin via her Art business.

One interview (there are thousands every week about BTC) doesn't move the price of BTC but I agree that the numbers are exaggerated 
**About buying/selling BTC**
All the big wallets (some of the BTC firm size addresses with 1,000-10,000 BTC) have already been accumulating 450,000 BTC since August 2018, in just 9 months.
Next, we have the retailers with wallets (0-100 BTC on hard wallets and/or Exchanges like Coinbase or Binance) who also accumulated some 126,000 BTC.
These retailers own some 38% of all circulating supply.

Cryptocurrencies: some 2,170 and Market pairs more than 18,000 on CoinMarketCap. There’s nobody who studied all white papers. Impossible. The market will get rid of most. It’s a question of when..not if and then the process of selecting the best ones begins. But IMO the very best ones are already known now and are within the Top 100 crypto’s. I own just 10 coins and all of them in the top 30-40

I'm curious why you call him a moron. If you're 19 or 20 and made a few million $ already with cryptocurrencies  I don't think you're a stupid moron...just my opinion.

I want to add that Coinmarketcap mentions about  :
**We have received reports that user deposits and withdrawals are impeded. Please be careful with your funds.**

Agree. With more than 2,170 cryptocurrencies the market (read investors) will grab their swords �� and kill the worthless coins. Very good!
