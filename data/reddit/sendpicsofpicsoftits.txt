Thats cute but my family whom was raised in the US mostly stays in Brittian now and travels the world routinely. His millions could have got great private healthcare instead they reset a bone incorrectly put him on a 3 months waiting list, he got an infection during that 3 months and came back to have to have the bone broken and reset because it had been so long but anyways.... Yeah universal sucks ass. 
No incentive, equal wait, no doctors with any incentive to do better. Less medicines.
Further noting: he now flies  for any major health concerns to places he can pay to receive care... Because hed rather.

Correction: if it switched to universal during your stay theyd disconnect you for new patient processing and put you on a waiting list behind all the other free patients and then come back to you (still comatose in the waiting room) in 3 years with a doctor whos performed 37 surgeries today and thinks your a diabetic who came in for a toe amputation.

I am a sociopath by many of the proper definitions which you seem to have confused as a blanket term for people with some sort of disorder causing some very stiff case of apathy however, I see you specifically want to defend this one woman and a dumpster thing. Theres actually free services just for folks like her and Id be hard pressed to assume just like universal healthcare those systems such as homeless shelters arent working because shes eating from a dumpster or just like the free healthcare services WE ALREADY HAVE. IE: Free health clinics... She chooses not to go to one because they suck and there are waiting list because they arent funded like a private practice.
