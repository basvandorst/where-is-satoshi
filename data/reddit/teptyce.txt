Great news! now, get some of those coins China has on sale
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:26:28
It is much more simple than that if you take into account Bitcoin's main attribute: **Immutability**. 
That's why bitcoin will be OK no matter what the politics or how human emotions swing. So there is no risk of any hard-fork, bitcoin will never HF as the first internet protocol never was substituted (despite 'better' options developed) because it was already too big and had the network effect. 
So layers and apps on top of it were delivering what the market was asking for. The same for bitcoin: scalability, anonymity/privacy, smart contracts, wills/deeds/birth/marriages/death/property registers, voting, etc. will all be built on top of the original blockchain. 
BU and others can diverge to create their own alt-coins, but that has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it will always be only one Bitcoin the same way there was and there is only one Internet. There will be no hard forks.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-02-11 05:53:17
Stop that negativism, you give him too much importance, not even governments can run bitcoin into the ground. Honey badger don't care. Even in the worst case scenario, they will hard-fork an run *their* 'unlimited' alt-coin into the ground. Bitcoin will be ok.

@_date: 2017-02-11 04:51:11


Nah, they are running out of bullets, and even If they do, their effect is ever smaller and shorter. As somebody else said, the honey badger is getting immune to the dragon bites. Also they are running out of coins, since they are panic selling them all and coins distribution is getting more decentralized as many other countries are entering the game and picking up those coins.

@_date: 2017-02-03 14:48:20
So now, even when bitcoin rises, even breaking the psychological barrier and landmark of $1000... bitcoin still plummets? ... WTF media.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:57:47
It is the opposite, Chinese continue to sell their bitcoins for Yuan (they can't withdraw their coins but they can *and* they are selling them), evidenced by the $50 dollars gap in price. So the supply has been constant from China, the difference this time (vs old "China Bans Bitcoin" crashes) is that many other countries are entering the game and are scooping up all those panic-sold cheap Chinese coins.
@_date: 2017-02-18 14:34:52
I was referring to the sudden change in trend: 1hr volume vs the 24hr (shown in your screenshot) or longer period, where indeed US volume it has been higher as stated on my post.
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:18:49
The "Mega Crash!^TM" happened just *yesterday*, and so many here said it would take weeks or months to recover. Honey badger begs to differ.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:01:23
No, it will not. Bitcoin recovers faster every time, panic sell is over faster, even this "massive bad news" had a very limited effect. bitcoin ownership is becoming more decentralized as more and more countries enter the game, so China-FUD gets more diluted over time.

@_date: 2017-02-18 04:52:23
I think that will be just temporary, just like with the "Massive China Bitcoin Crackdown!" latest news, honey badger shook it off and kept going. Bitcoin is much more mature and there is an ever accelerating organic growth, with more and more new countries getting involved. So Bitcoin will continue to go up, regardless. Just keep buying a little bit every week and enjoy the show.

This is as absurd as saying in the 90's that internet/email was not the alternative to regular mail/communications because could not handle the traffic.
There will be apps on top of the bockchain that will handle everything it needs to do (privacy, scaling, smart contracts, microtransactions, etc.)
@_date: 2017-02-10 21:45:17
That's what will happen anyway, and  this is good for bitcoin also because the coins distribution is becoming more decentralized as panic-sold cheap Chinese coins are being picked up by many other countries entering the game, decreasing more the China FUD news influence/impact over time.
@_date: 2017-02-02 18:45:20


@_date: 2017-02-10 04:36:08


That's not accurate, most of the innovation and  bitcoin ecosystem is outside of China, also most real trading volumes is done now in dollars, after the bust in China's margin trading and stopping 0 fee trades. It is getting more decentralized by the day as more countries are entering the game.
@_date: 2017-02-09 08:23:01

 The future economy will be totally digital and decentralized. Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Almost for free (a few cents fee).
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.
@_date: 2017-02-10 18:38:53

Yes, very good, they are running out of bullets, and even If they try to pull out another fast one, their effect/impact is ever smaller and shorter. As somebody else said, the honey badger is getting immune to the dragon bites. Also they are running out of coins, since they are panic selling them all and coins distribution is getting more decentralized as many other countries are entering the game and picking up those limited supply  coins.
@_date: 2017-02-18 05:30:57
I think it will be approved, there are no real reasons not to do it, even if not explicitly approved then it will be by default (no decision one way or the other). I agree it may go to $2000, but the pull back would stabilize around $1500, in my opinion.

If this would be general knowledge (possibility of a 'default' approval by not deciding one way or the other) the betting markets would have the odds for approval close to 90%. That option is why I feel very strongly it will get approved.

Your interpretation is misled by your feelings. Nobody is celebrating that, what are you talking about? This is not about celebration, but purely about raising awareness. Do you want the people to remain ignorant/uninformed?
@_date: 2017-02-15 13:22:53
Exactly, we have a floor around $1000 (last big bad news from China stopping bitcoin withdrawals just sunk the price to $950 and recovered back to $1000 quickly).
So the next bull run (maybe triggered by ETF approval) will take the price much higher.

* Less excessive gambling/speculation/bubbles

 Bitcoin, just like the internet/email are no bubbles, are decentralized systems, the CENTRALISED companies created around them can become a bubble and eventually fail, but Bitcoin is here to stay, the future currency will be totally digital (e-coin/centralized vs bitcoin/decentralized).
All the major banks and ‘smart money’ are investing in bitcoin and related startups, as well as they are buying physical gold and silver, they know what’s coming soon.. Also, the amount of bitcoins is limited to 21 million ever. 
Remember when bitcoin was less than 1 dollar each? there are cycles, it grows to the 10ths of dollar and crashes to 1 dollar, then in "bubbles" to 100 and crashes to 10 dollars, next bubble went to 1000 and then crashed to 200's, when this "bubble" pops the price will "crash down" to $3,000 after peaking around $10,000. This run/cycle/"bubble" has barely started.

That is correct, the proportion of transactions are usually more than 50/1  (China/USA), lately it has come down to around 20/1 (sometimes 10/1), so more selling by China and more buying by USA. Many westerners that were sitting on the sidelines are jumping on this opportunity they were waiting for, good for them.
