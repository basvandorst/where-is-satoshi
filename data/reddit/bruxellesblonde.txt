Weird. I used my Chase Freedom Unlimited to buy Litecoin on Dec. 21. Worked for me. Is it just checking accounts?

Thank you!

I mean, initially, I'd say tulips are perishable and tulips were not the brainchild of some very smart dudes whose ideas attracted other very smart dudes and eventually attracted those smart dudes' investments.

Interesting. And why does that differentiation matter?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:04:48
Nuances would be appreciated. I'm here to learn. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:18:46
That explains why it doesn't scare me. I'm not a traditional investor. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:07:42
And what's the conversion on that? Can I get fractional tulips?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:55
Okay. Cool. I get that. Which makes it far different than tulips.

That's what surprises me. I just saw a financial guy talking about it on our local news this morning and he did a decent job but still treated it as this weird, volatile thing.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:09:23
You bring up good points and it all makes sense to me. But why aren't we seeing those counter-arguments popping up in the mainstream media? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:30
Also, "volatile" is relative, right? Yes, LTC tripled and then dropped 25% in a matter of days, but what about LTC in the year-long context?

...and because you a$$holes are gaming the system, the rest of us now have to pay cash advance fees. Hope you enjoy that free flight.

They didn't change the code. The networks did.

The networks did, I believe. I'd be interested to see exactly how everything went down and what the benefit is for all parties involved. Obviously, credit cards don't dictate MCC's. But they certainly have sway with Visa, AmEx and MC. Fees mitigate their risk. 
However, yesterday's announcement that BofA, Chase and Citi are banning crypto purchases adds another element to it.
