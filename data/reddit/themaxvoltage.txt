And then wait 3 days for the transaction to confirm because you receive your churro. It’s the future!
The guy is just being funny, and I would probably see that sign, shoot the shit with him about BTC and then buy some churros in USD.

That’s little spike recently is what’s commonly know as a “bull trap” before assets crash. But what do I know. To the moon? HODL? lightning network! Overthrow the government! Fiat is useless!

You don’t realize that trying to obfuscate profits is tax evasion right? You’ll probably get away with it 99 times out of 100, but the IRS will fuck you that 1% is the time.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:04:35
That is incorrect. If you make a profit on any buy or sell, you are obligated to report that profit as capital gain (either short term or long term depending on how long you held it). Not reporting your profits is a quick way to get fucked by the IRS.

This is probably the most naive comment I’ve ever read on the internet .

Lol. No its not, its GDAX not sending the wire. Fed Wires are instant.

Nah man, when I buy coffee I like to wait 4 days and pay an $18 fee before I receive. The future of money!
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:03:22
Lol ok man. If I transfer from checking to savings it’s instant. If I transfer to another bank it takes one day unless I opt for a wire (which I get for free) in which case it’s a couple hours maximum. The banking system in the US isn’t perfect but people act like paying $50 to move $40 dollars and waiting 3 weeks is some sort of revolution when in fact it’s just ridiculous.

You pay a fee to withdraw your cash because cash is heavy to transport and requires security. That’s why there is a fee. Fees for point of sale transactions are incentives for the companies who created the point of sale network to offer their services. BTC fees are there to incentivize the processing of transactions.
But comparing withdrawing cash from an ATM to bitcoin is an unlike comparison.

I think you underestimate the desire for privacy.

That’s pretty interesting actually. Sounds like the plot to a Mission Impossible movie.

Cash is heavy and requires a lot of security to transport. That’s why ATMs cost money.
Comparing an ATM withdrawal to an electronic transfer is an unlike comparison.

It’s not a million dollar bet, it was an options contract that had a strike price worth a million dolllars should the buyer choose to execute.
A call that far out of the money has to have been incredibly cheap. This hedgefund probably made a $10,000 bet that BTC is over 50k lol.

Intentionally withholding financial information during a divorce proceeding could come back to bite you in the ass in a big big big big way. I recommend being honest and truthful /I am not an attorney this is not legal advice

The irony, of course, is that bitcoin on has value because we believe it has value. The only reason bitcoin is worth $10,000 a coin is because someone was willing to pay $10,000 a coin. 
Fundamentally this is the same as fiat, but let the downvotes commence.
