Just because you can't convert it all to the marginal price now doesn't mean you can't over some time convert it to some large fraction of the marginal price.

Sounds kind of like usenet before spam choked out all of the non-binary groups.

Was your salary set at a fixed quantity of bitcoin, or was it expected to float with the exchange rate?

Why do you think that lost is better than stolen?

I suppose this is tangentally related, but I have been wondering for some time what would happen if you cut your target off from the bulk of the bitcoin network prior to attempting to spend fraudulent coins. 
Is there some warning bells that would go off in the standard client if you MITM'd their internet traffic and directed all bitcoin messages exclusively to machines you controlled? You wouldn't need 51% of the entire network, just 51% of the network your target could see.

I'm really sorry to hear it, I hope that hasn't led to severe financial hardship.

Were you to rename it, what would you choose?

Additionally, if the network on which you wish to use bitcoin is under state control, they can inhibit your traffic at will. 
(I ran some google searches prior to posting this and found several people suggesting that bitcoin traffic could be easily disguised or hidden, allowing it to function within a hostile network. This is fascinating - it's like a subset of DRM. You would need to generate packets which are unrecognizable to the network yet comprehensible to remote and untrusted bitcoin participents.)
