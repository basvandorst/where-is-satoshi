Thanks,  
My initial target audience are non-technical Mac users.   
I'm building an SPV wallet (not a full node).
Currently some of the features I'm working on are :  
\- multiple accounts, ex. Savings for a new car, Joint account with your significant one, Shopping, Donations  
\- ways to lock/unlock your account via a group of "guardian" accounts  
I'm grateful for any feature requests you post, no matter how wild or crazy may seem.

Elum224, what is your use case?   
Ideally would you want the software to work like a shopping cart (think Shopify) or you only need the fiat processor that stores your account in Bitcoin ?

Thanks, the main reasons are:   
\- I don't have significant experience with the programming languages  Electrum or Bitcoin Core are built in : Python and C++  
\- The 2 projects already have good developer teams committed to the them  
\- I'm interested in building a wallet for the non-techies

Would the user receive something from you like a digital or physical product or service ?  
If not, you could use an API like [ to convert Fiat to Crypto.
