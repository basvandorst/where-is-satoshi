don't use Coinspot you will get destroyed on fees...
btcmarkets is best imo, or NCX is a new exchange with NO trading fees, only withdrawal fees

because it changes nothing - there was no ETF decision before and there isn't one now, Bitcoin will continue to exist regardless

you mean you didn't write down the code for the authenticator and store it safely like binance told you to?

The fact that it has dropped from $20,000 to $6,000 in a matter of months. The amount of hacks, scams within the cryptosphere as a whole. Mt. Gox. The amount of responsibility that is required regarding the security of your own funds. The amount of obvious paid-shills on YouTube which have a large following. The amount of bot manipulation and whale manipulation. The amount of mainstream media manipulation. The amount of power Bitmain has. The amount of influence a select few people have. The lack of regulation within crypto as a whole. The fact that regulatory decisions that you have little to no power over can greatly affect the price. The fact that your response to these changes will generally be too slow compared to the market. Not to mention most betting sites that let you bet on Bitcoin prices have the likeliest price of Bitcoin being between $1k-$5k EOY 2018.
Really could go on and on...
Now with all of that, I think it would be hard to convince someone who is used to the safety of banks and relative "stability" of more traditional investments such as property, stocks etc. to part with cash for BTC. Unless your national currency is extremely volatile too (in which case they would most likely trade for USD).
EDIT: By the way I'm invested, these are just some reasons that I could easily see as a deterrent from investing.

From Australia, recommend using BTC Markets for AUD/BTC pair. Relatively cheap fees compared to the competition (Coinspot). Or you can give up and coming exchange National Currency Exchange a whirl, no trading fees, only withdrawal fees.
Coinbase will be difficult for you as you'd need a US bank account afaik.
Good luck!
