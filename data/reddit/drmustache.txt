No, we support someone who the gov't has accused of being a wannabe murder... especially when we see all the accusations falling apart at the seams.  The prosecution went on and on about how he should be denied bail because of these allegations, then later never bothered to bring them in as formal charges.  Well wait a sec... if he's being accused of this, maybe you should ...ya know... include it in the charges or soemthing right?
     Not to mention there's zero... with a great big z.... evidence to support the claim, which... appears to have ammounted to nothing more than media fodder in an attempt to condemn him in the court of public opinion before trial  This is the M.O. for government when they don't have a case but really want to set precident... bang the war drums, accuse the person of acts which will destroy all support from all sides, then hope that the negative sentiment against the person will be strong enough once the trial comes along and that it will be a contributing factor to lead to a guilty verdict.
If you take any time out at all to examine the facts behind the case, you'll see that the alligations start falling apart immediately and have virtualy no substance to them.

@_date: 2012-08-09 00:38:21
Just a couple things that come to mind: (sorry if someone has already mentioned them.  Just chiming in real quick and getting back to work)
1.  Create a brief persuasive and educational video under 5 minutes about the benefits of accepting bitcoins.
2. Look into gold and silver dealers in your community.  Many will have lists of companies which will accept gold and silver as a form of payment for goods and services provided.  Contact them about bitcoins.  Since they already demonstrate a willingness and understanding of the benefits of accepting other items of value, this may be an easy way to increase the number of places that accept bitcoins.
3. Write something for a local newspaper/magazine about bitcoins.  Many people simply do not know enough about them and the more prevalent the item is, the more curiosity it will arouse.
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:58:17
Sweet.  Yeah I've just been watching the whole bitcoin thing for a while seeing if there wee unknown externals to watch for or not, but it's looking pretty solid at this point so wanted to start testing the waters.

@_date: 2012-09-14 13:56:09
Yeah, that makes sense well enough.  I think I just had my expectations set a little high perhaps and wasn't taking into account all the variable factors at play like you mentioned above.  I don't think I will let this dissuade me however from getting in on this.  I'm going to be talking to my landlord later about allowing for bitcoin payments for rent.  Might even take them down a couple of coonskin caps and tell them what pioneers they'll be for doing it.
@_date: 2012-09-14 13:53:27
Ain't it the truth.  I am still highly interested in making a move to bitcoin.  I think that the more people begin asking/offering/insisting that their exchanges be made in bitcoin, the more influence is had in turning the tide away from a system based on fraud and towards one based on sound monetary practices which will lead to prosperity for all and not just those at the top via a parasitic model of deceit and violence.  The trick is to spend energies working TOWARDS what we want however rather than simply working AGAINST what we don't want.
@_date: 2012-09-14 13:58:08
Yeah, I think you're right.  All that has to be done is continue to work towards solutions we want rather than against systems that we don't want.  Can you imagine the impact that could be had if everyone who was so focused on how bad the FED is just stopped wasting time on petitions and protests and invested that energy instead in buying and selling bitcoin and educating local businesses about the benefits of exchanging in alternative currencies?  
@_date: 2012-09-12 13:17:35
yeah that was kinda my problem going into this.  I was expecting it to be fairly uncomplicated.  That's kinda what I get for thinking I guess.  Anyway, found someone on there willing to sell at $12 per BTC, which I figure is roughly what I could expect anywhere else after the fees and everything.  I just had this idea in my head that I'd be able to hop on whenever, plug in some numbers and click 'buy' and that'd be that.  Not so much it seems.
@_date: 2012-09-12 12:05:36
All of this because of potential charge backs?  We can send a man to the moon, but we can't sort out a proper system of when money exchanges hands?  I don't get it, this doesn't seem like rocket science.  A agrees to give B money via C.  C gets money, then gives it to B.  Once it's in B's hands, B transfers goods/services to A... why does this have to be so complicated?  Idunno, this just seems like a huge barrier getting into it.  I mean, it seems like things are poised to jump today, but the longer it keeps moving up in value, the less compelled I am to pay more for it ya know?  I'd be happy to buy shit for a local bitcoiner, but what are you supposed to do just hang out the window with a bullhorn or send up smoke signals or?  Idunno... whatever.  It's probably a sign I wasn't supposed to get in on it anyway.
@_date: 2013-02-19 15:45:12
I've been thinking along similar lines.  A mass propaganda campaign seems to be about the only way to shut this thing down as far as I can tell.  
That aside, they could try outlawing merchants from accepting it as a form of payment, but I think more study would have to be done to get an idea if such restrictions could be pushed through.  Which, I think... would lead back to the propaganda campaign.  If they can convince the house and senate that 'bitcoins are bad...mmmkay', then they might be able to push it through.  Of course there's always good old fashioned economic political influence should the banks that comprise the Federal Reserve decide to buy out the politicians to do their bidding.
In the end, I think it's going to boil down to a propaganda campaign.  The banks that comprise the Fed, (as I understand it) own both the AP &amp; Reuters (where all the other news outlets get their parroted stories)... and we have the internet and various alternative media outlets (Infowars for better or worse perhaps being one of the bigger ones).
There's an old war general who's name at the moment I can't recall.  As I heard it, the guy never lost a single battle.  At the end of his career, when asked how he managed to pull off such an unfathomable record he replied something to the effect of, *"It's really quite simple.... you just be the first one there with the most."*
I think those words might serve us well here. If this is all going to boil down to a war for the hearts and minds of the people... then it would serve us best to be the first ones there with the most.  An effective, and relentless PRO-bitcoin propaganda campaign may very well be in order at this time.

I always try to wait for just after the dips personally.  The thinking is, you never know when something has hit the bottom until after it's hit the bottom.  So you wait until you get to the bottom of a nice valley... then, see if a mountain forms at the top of that valley on the other side.  Granted you miss the floor, however... you also don't risk buying in at a 20% drop when it will be a 40% drop overall.  I say wait for it to prove that 40% drop, then buy 10 to 15% up off that.  You still get a discounted rate from before the drop, and you dont risk as much.  That's my approach anyway.

@_date: 2013-11-17 22:11:40
I don't see the major players being interested much in making money.  I mean, think about it... they *own* the printing presses and the governments that they loan that money out to with interest attached.
As Mayer Amstel Rothschild once said, "Give me control of a nations money supply and I care not who makes it's laws".  For the big players, it's about control of currency and the power that they get from such control.
In short, they're not interested in earnings to be had from Bitcoin holdings.  They're interested in the power they posses being retained and not disrupted by Bitcoin.  Thus, their main focus is using their ownership of government, which in turn has a monopoly on the initiation of violent force, to shut Bitcoin down.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:52:44
True.  I tend to look at it from the angle of the existing power structure.  I mean, we all know that the private bankers who combined, own the "federal" reserve system *own* the government in the way a parent who doles out allowance *owns* their children, and for the most part, their kids will do just about whatever they want given that relationship.
We also know that government is a one trick pony... that one trick being to flex their monopoly on the initiation of violent force against people.  Which is in part why btc is so beautiful, given that theirs no source point to go wave guns at and threaten, making it much more difficult to control.
But couldn't we see a scenario where... say for example, politician A is having their pockets lined by company B, who is threatened by the expansion of Bitcoin, so they do what they can to ensure the safety of what should otherwise be an outdated company given the new technology.  So they pass some law using the usual methods and say, "ok, now any merchant accepting bitcoin will have a gun pointed at them if we catch you accepting the evil currency... ya know, for the children and apple pie and stuff." ?
I could see something like that, but... I also find it to be of little consequence as it would only increase the value of BTC the same way alcohol went up in price during prohibition or the price of pot once it was made illegal.  Additionally, I should think that if trends are similar, it would actually increase it's usage and desirability.  So while a bit of a headache, ultimately it would work in BTC's favor.  But then, left unattended, it would continue to grow and flourish also... so...
But yeah, that's kinda where my mind is at with some of this.  Just wondering what others are thinking on this topic.

In my opinion, there are a few possibilities.  One is that people would simply adapt to buying fractions of coins.  While I see this being entirely possible, I suspect by the time BTC reaches a price per unit which is no longer viable (without buying in fractions), there will be a split.  Some will prefer to continue with BTC and buy in fractions... others will prefer the psychological comforts of owning whole units of something similar.  This is where LiteCoin will start shadowing Bitcoins movements more closely.  All else constant, we should anticipate a value on Litecoin roughly 1/4 of BTC value.
   In short, some will prefer to spend $100 on 0.5 BTC, whereas others will prefer to own whole units, and will elect for spending their $100 on 2 LTC instead.  I suspect BTC GPU miners will be the initial advocates of LTC as the margins on earnings decrease due to the growing influx of ASIC miners into the BTC mining market.
As for goods prices, they will most likely still be primarily influenced by the existing system/patterns associated with the USD and inflationary rates over the next several years.  Broadly speaking, expect prices on goods and services to continue to rise.  Growing adoption of BTC however should dampen such rises though.
Bitcoin will eventually stop growing, but that is a distance perhaps a bit too far out to begin examining yet.  I would anticipate the volatile fluctuations in price to stabilize however... something akin to seeing a car slowly work it's way out of a fishtail.
Overall, I would anticipate mostly net positive gains for BTC over at least the next 2 years.  One of the beautiful parts in my opinion is that conditions are such currently (and in trending) that nearly any maneuver on the part of banks or government to attack BTC will almost certainly lead to a rise in BTCs value and use.

There's some truth to the investment angle certainly, however I'd be leery of tying any of said investment too much in anything connected to the USD.  Suppose you buy some stock in ABC company and it goes up from $100 to $500.. all good and well.  But then if the dollar does what many Austrian economist types tend to think it will in the next few years, then it's all for not, as those gains might earn you one too two loaves of bread.   Instead, I would recommend  diversifying between gold, silver (physical holdings, not certificates), holding mostly bitcoin and various bitcoin based investments.  There's plenty of ones out there that pay out dividends, so that might be a wise option.  Regardless what you do with it however, congratulations!

Here's another one:
Internet pornography industry:  Estimated value of $97B annually.  If we assume a 5% annual growth, that's 101.85B, and estimating Bitcoin is adopted by 25% of that market as a method of payment, then that brings each coin value stand alone to $1,212.50.  If we add the estimated 25% market share of the remittance market, that comes to $8057.73809524 per coin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 16:56:52
Agreed.  lol @ tinfoil.  Hadn't heard that one in a good number of years.  I'm just wondering how it hashes out on the chessboard here if/once they do make moves against it.  I mean, ultimately I see it playing out as a win for BTC.  Maybe it scares everyone into a panic sell when the US says, "ok, it's illegal...we'll point guns at you if you accept it".  That creates a panic sell... price plunges hard and fast before stabilizing and growing even larger than it is now in a grey and black market environment.  
I mean, ultimately, I get the sense that any attempt to negatively control BTC will result in a positive growth for the currency (see prohibition, and other illicit items before and afters in terms of usage and price for reasoning), I'm just trying to sort out how to make it best work in our favor regardless what they do.

Here's one I used to email a local e-cig store I do business with.  Obviously you'll have to edit it a bit to make it a cut and paste type of thing, but hopefully it helps:
Hey there,
     I was just curious to know if you guys had any plans to begin accepting Bitcoin as a payment method at your store/s.  I've been vaping for a few years now and regularly do business at your store.  I've also been holding and investing into Bitcoin for about a year or so.  At any rate,  I'm wanting to move away from Federal Reserve notes as much as possible and into something more simple, convenient and secure and so I'm looking for merchants to do business with who accept Bitcoin for goods and services I frequently purchase.  As of now I'm looking at  ,  ,  , &amp;  as possible options for doing business.
     I like doing business with you guys though, so I thought I'd just give you a heads up and see if you had any plans to incorporate Bitcoin as a payment option any time soon.  I even know a guy that helps small businesses get situated easily for payment acceptance.  His site is here if you're interested:  
Thanks for your time and I hope to be using Bitcoin in your store soon!
I'm thinking if you make the needed edits, and then maybe plug in a bit about the benefits for merchants, that might help spice it up a bit more in your favor.  If you do, please message me a copy as I would like to continue to email local businesses about accepting bitcoin.

I got downvoted into oblivion over on at r/Apple for inquiring if the company itself had any consideration or concern into this sort of thing.  Not exactly in a static sense, but rather in a trending sense since it seems more and more I see the sentiment expressed that the individual intends to drop iPhone due to Apple's hostilities towards Bitcoin.  Seems the cult creation method of advertising might not only serve as the boom to their business but perhaps the eventual bust as well.

No... economists of that nature are only household names because the institutions that benefit from their "intellectual" analysis basically force feed them to us.  It's kind of a perverted symbiotic relationship really.
The real economists (read: Austrian) who have been accurately predicting prices, bubbles, crashes etc over the last several decades are typically much more chatterbox about it.
In short, the Krugmans of the world aren't talking about it because it would be the end of their career.

I used to work for Apple.  I was actually selected for a pilot sales program exclusively focusing on the iPhone in an attempt to boost their closing sales volume (which was remarkably low at the time, largely due to the exclusive they had with AT&amp;T at the time).  
So essentially, my job was to just sell the iPhone.  I did that job, and I did it well.  I was actually one of the leading revenue generators in the sales department.
However even with that level of knowledge about iPhone, I still can not recommend it to friends or family, regardless of what carrier you're on.
There's a wide variety of reasons as to why, but their hostility towards Bitcoin is just the proverbial icing on the cake.

It's definitely a risky investment.  It's an experiment in a sense. However, it's an experiment with a strong number of reasons which support the hypothesis that it (or something very much like it), will succeed in the long run.
So don't put more in than you can afford to lose.
And while Bitcoin is extensively complex in it's structure, I tend to think it's much like the internet.  We all start off asking "how does it work", and most of us eventually come to a point where we cease to ask"how does it work", and begin asking, "how does it work *for me*"?

I have about an 80-20 save to spend ratio that i try to apply.  I mean, what's the point of gaining wealth if you don't enjoy a little material gain in the process?
I also think it's good to have a strong showing of success for those that choose to adopt BTC, so I'll support just about anyone at this stage in the game that adopts it.
So for now... I'd say buy with BTC.  Yeah it'll be worth more in the future, however that's partly because of the adoption factor.  So sit on about 80% but allocate about 20% to buy goods and services and reward anyone who makes the plunge right now.

They do a rockstar job when it comes to predicting currency and value prices.  Rewind to 2005 I started paying attention to these guys since they were saying some things I'd never heard before.  Many of them were talking about gold prices being poised to take off through the roof.  I looked at their track records, compared them to the track records of the Keynesian economists and laid down my bets.
While I didn't have much to put in, I knew some people who did.  I kept on them from 400 to 500, 500 to 600, 600 to 700 and then they listened.  Annuities were sold off, 401ks were cashed in, gold was purchased, and some people did pretty well on up to 1800 &amp; 1900.

Too bad about his career choices later in life.  Regardless, I think most of us would agree that the community will be facing a battle somewhere down the road over the future of bitcoin.
It would most probably behoove all of us to give some time to consider how best to win a battle before it begins.
I think there's something about this in The Art Of War... something about how every battle begins with a battle for the hearts and minds of a people, and how the outcome of the final battle tends to be determined by the success or failure of that initial propaganda campaign.
I don't think it will be much longer before the mainstream media comes trumpeting us all as drug dealers, pedophiles, money launderers, gangsters, crooks, and so forth.  I just think it would be a good idea to convince the people quite to the contrary before hand.

If you need it in the next month, jump ship.  If you're able to hold out longer than that, stay in.  I'm thinking we're going to see a dip to about $14.75, gradual climb to $20 ballpark, and then another jump like we've seen in the last weeks bringing us into the mid 30s, possibly higher depending on if any major online players begin accepting bitcoin.

I never said they over reacted. Plus the sub is closer to 80k than 50k at this point which is something like a 60% increase in a fairly short time frame.  The point to examine also is not a stationary one, but rather a trending one.  That is to say that perhaps 25k people setting down iphones and going to other phones isn't problematic for the company now, but if we assume a rough trending growth (estimated) of 60% every few months, then yes... at a certain point this would become highly problematic.
It's less of an attack on Apple and more of a friendly inquiry due to the potential for financial loss.  Sort of the market equivalent of telling a friend they have a little booger hanging out of their nose.  But it seems that the cult creation method of advertising that Apple has successfully used over the years has made many of it's evangelists a little blind to that concept.
I would add that I've been using Apple products for roughly ten years now.
