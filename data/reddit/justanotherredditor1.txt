I just found out that i have a backup of a wallet i created back in 2013!
 I think it was created with client from bitcoin.org. How can i easily and securly check the balance of this wallet? I downloaded the client but i'ts gonna take a day to download the blockchain. Is there any other way to do it, without risking my bitcoin?
It's not a lot of money, we are talking about maybe a month's salary, but it would be a nice bonus to a otherwise poor student :)

Guess i'll just wait for the blockchain to download. 
Thanks tho :)

It prints to the console now. Is there a way to get it in GUI? (Python 2.7.3 on Windows)
