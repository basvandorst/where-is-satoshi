Some of those people on zero hedge are preparing for a complete collapse of society and its infrastructure.

I think it has a good chance. I think a lot of those 300k new coinbase users didn't buy right off the bat, instead they want to wait for a big drop, which they might not get. IF there is a hint that the market is just going to keep going up, many of these people holding back will fomo into the market, which could bring it to 13-14k pretty quickly, cause a media frenzy, then that would take us to 20k.

I don't think it's possible to go from the worlds first decentralized digital currency being worth nothing, to being a stable currency worth X amount of dollars without it being volatile between those points. I think this 'insanity' is really just par for the course. If bitcoin went from 0 to stable in just a few years, something would be very fishy about that. This seems normal to me, not insane. 
Edit: I also think that generally things that look like scams, and promise huge returns generally are scams. The problem is that when you have a genuine opportunity, they're almost indistinguishable from these scams you've seen before. A wealthy man once told me "Life is going to give you 1, maybe 2 chances to make a lot of money, over the span of your entire life. The tricky part is identifying the real chances." My advice to you is this, consider the fundamentals. 17 million bitcoins, 2-3 billion possible speculators, perhaps 1 million total bitcoins even for sale at any given moment. It would be pretty hard for anything with those numbers NOT to look like a pump and dump as new money entered the market. Do not write this thing off just because the increase in price is spectacular, because if you do the math, you'll see that it can get *way more spectacular* than this. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:57:34
I don't know why, but it just seems like all these forks have some purpose that the majority of people aren't considering.  Could you launder money this way? This fork is absolutely retarded, there has to be some other motive, and it's not usurp bitcoin from the throne.

Shaking out the weak hands I suppose. Testing lower support is always good in these price run ups. I get more concerened when the price just goes up and up and up (going up too fast), although I haven't seen that happen since 2013. 
I Dunno if there are any videos of what that looked like back then, but it's definitely a vivid memory to me. The price starts going up like how it just went down, but for a weirdly long sustained amount of time. It's incredible.

A really good way to get the most out of your investment is to learn everything you possibly can, about any that has to do with bitcoin. Learn how bitcoin works, learn about encryption, learn about networks, learn about what the internet is and how it works, learn about economics, learn about the history of money, learn about how the stock market works from trade to settlement. 
If you learn the stuff that goes along with understanding why bitcoin is so great, then even if you wind up losing the $400 you invested, you'll still have learned something very valuable.

Yeah, I'm really trying to support overstock though, I think it's awesome what they've done with bitcoin and what they're doing.  
@_date: 2015-06-13 06:38:10
You should just buy something on overstock on the projector in front of them using your phone. That always blows my mind, when I send the coins, and the window on the overstock bitcoin payment screen instantly/automatically recognizes my payment. Maybe buy a ledger hardware wallet :) 
Edit: I know that this could be done with something like apple pay, but the other thing is It feels more like a cash transaction considering that the money could go directly to the merchant without an intermediary. I say 'could go' because right now overstock uses bitpay, but I think eventually merchants will keep their sales in bitcoin. Right now a bitcoin transaction blows my mind, because it's like a glimpse into the future of online payments. 
Edit 2: It's also cool to consider what else overstock could do. They could program their incoming revenue to automatically pay employees, issue dividends for stock holders, pay suppliers etc, all without someone arbitrating the distribution after it's coded. I'd like to see credit cards do that!
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:57:20

Even though bitcoin threatens banks in some ways, i believe one of banks main income sources that will remain untouched will be loans. 
I could see them offering bitcoin services to slow down the erosion of the services that bitcoin will threaten (transfers etc.). They can probably turn a nice profit using bitcoin. Some people may never want to secure their own bitcoins, or even come up with a good password. They might even be too scared to send bitcoins themselves. That's where banks could help.

Noticed a lot of upvotes on this comment. Which I understand, because it makes sense, but I think it's important to reflect on this. 
We 'hate' kids who do wierd things for what we perceive as the right reason, because we want to help this hypothetical kid act normally.
The problem is that sometimes us trying to help by hating or shaming a kid, doesn't help at all. In fact, it just alienates the kid. 
When we bully, or make fun of someone, we always assume that the person we're bullying is really only capable of coming back with some verbal response that is as damaging as the verbal attack we initiated. That's the worst case scenario we're thinking of at the time. They fire back with some witty response and make us look like assholes. 
I think people need to start thinking a bit more deeply about the situation. That person you're making fun of, or hating for all the right reasons, has the ability to come back at you any way they want. ANY WAY. There are no rules.

People want to make a difference. Look at Toms shoes, they would have never made it if it weren't for their shoe charity. When you get that warm-fuzzy feeling after making a purchase it makes you more inclined to make similar purchases. I bought a $1,200 item from a brick and mortar store using bitcoin and I got that warm fuzzy feeling when I realized that I just put ~$50 extra bucks in this guy's pocket. He was just a dude, maybe he had kids, but by choosing to use bitcoin I bought him groceries for a few days. I made a difference. I didn't care about toppling banks, or credit card companies, or governments. I want everyone to get the same feeling when they buy stuff using bitcoins.

Thanks! :) 
I agree with you, I don't think bitcoin is more valuable than your money now. Everyone takes your regular money now, it's stable, it's easy to store, safe, secure, etc. But that's where it ends. You can't really do any cool computer stuff with regular money. There lies the potential. Some think bitcoin has potential, some think it will crash and burn. I personally think it has great potential, but to each his/her own. It's fascinating to say the least, I love keeping up with the news and seeing the new developments. 2015 will be an exciting year. 
I think one of the coolest parts about my experience with bitcoin is just how much i've learned about networks, cryptography, and computers in general. That in itself has been valuable to me, and has already made me look good in front of some potential employers. Best of luck. Cheers.

No it's an argument for getting him on stage to promote bitcoin by showing that he is a good/qualified/pragmatic person that would make an excellent spokesperson. You may have gotten confused, I was addressing your sourceless concern that Allaire's statements have been "A little anti-startup and pro-regulation." You were using that to show that his character is what makes you not want him to be on stage at SXSW. When in reality, what you think is a character flaw is actually something someone speaking to potential investors needs to have in order to be taken seriously: An open mind toward regulation that won't limit bitcoin's potential, but still allow it to flourish.
Also, please, a source about his anti start-up attitude, do you have one? Because, it's funny to me that you think a start up could be anti start up. Wouldn't they just explode or something?

@_date: 2014-10-02 15:08:09
So? I think my point was I don't really consider a buttcoiner's opinion any sort of basis for qualification of something like this post. You said *even the most rabid bitcoiner* as if that's the meter stick here. And what I'm trying to express is that all buttcoin offers is endless scrutiny and insult, which bitcoin has endured and survived, yet the scrutiny is persistent. So buttcoin goes beyond just being peer review, and seems more like a group of assholes jerking each other off, and throwing feces at bitcoin supporters. I understand and like scrutinizing new ideas, it's important, but there's no need to brand themselves as something different, and it's stupid to assume that "they" are the standard or upper limit of bitcoin scrutiny. 
Edit: Spelling, clarification.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:37:37
I still disagree. Not many of them understand the benefits of bitcoin, and are happy with the status quo. I think a continuous bubble cycle only gives them more ammo to help them feel like they're making the right decision by not getting involved. Because no matter if it even goes to 10,000, to them it's always eventually going to go to 0, because they don't get it.

A rock is a solid aggregate of one or more minerals. Gold is not a rock, it's an element and a mineral. 
To classify as a mineral, there are a few criteria: Naturally occurring, inorganic solid, definite chemical composition
specific atomic arrangement. 
Also, sounds like BK is referring to the public blockchain as an aggregate of multiple blockchains. I don't see how that makes any sense. I do see where he needs to be open to alt coins though, it allows him to do more stories by being open to many, as opposed to a proponent of one.

If bitcoin were to become stable then the price of goods in bitcoin would have the same affect. The reason why you differentiate dollars from bitcoin at this point is due to the relative stability of the dollar's value. The dollar does change in value, and goods change in cost, but at a much slower rate than bitcoin, a rate that you don't really notice from day to day unless there is a time of crisis, like when the euro crashed to nearly dollar parity recently.

I would say use circle, or coinbase, but I just used buttercoin last night for the first time and was able to get my identity verified, link my checking account, and initiate a transfer to my buttercoin account within 10 minutes. If you're only buying a little then a wallet like multibit with a couple backups would be fine. IF you're going to put a substantial amount of money into it I suggest getting a trezor first, or a piper bitcoin paper wallet printer, for storage. Of course if you go the way of paper wallets then I would suggest using Bip38 encryption (Which the piper does automatically if you want). Then use one of the services that lets you put your encrypted private key on a piece of steel or aluminum. Good luck, and watch out for the trolls. I'm really sorry about them, they're just so...angry. I don't get it. Anyway, Cheers! Please keep us updated on what you wind up doing! I'm curious how the process feels to someone new to the whole thing these days. It was a little more tough when I got involved. Full disclosure, I'm in the red right now, and you might very well be in the red too, just keep that in mind. In fact, it's more likely that you will lose money, than make money, if you're simply making a bet please don't. If you think bitcoin has potential because it's bad ass, then by all means be responsible.

You're right it's not a new thing. Currency isn't new, digital payments aren't new, it's the unique combination of old technologies which acts as a new thing. Check this out, suppose we lived in the time where the car was new. We both have been using horses our whole lives, so this car thing is weird. It's like a buggy, but there's no horse pulling it? Wtf? So basically this *car* moves us around like we're in a buggy, and no longer need a horse. It has combined 2 old technologies to become a new animal. 
I see bitcoin the same way I would have looked at the car when it was new. "But I have my horse! Why would I need a car?! My horse never breaks down!  I see no benefit to this new fandangled car see. And I heard you would need rubber for the tires and paved roads! We'll never have enough paved roads to take me to as many places as my horse can take me.

I think the beautiful thing is that you wouldn't need artists to agree to any contracts. Once they agree to have their music on the service, and to only be used for streaming, the band could just sit back and watch the bitcoin trickle in. Straight from the consumer to the artist. If we think bigger, bands could stream concerts, interviews, anything really. They could have a merch shop within the site too. I really think there's potential, especially for really bad assed niche bands like "The dear hunter" (Who record and produce their own music, and belong to their own label) or "Manchester Orchestra" (Produced by the dear hunter). Lots of bands are saying "We don't need you anymore" to the record labels. Turns out they're like any other business that wants exposure, they need google (youtube).

They said it all in the beginning. Transactions to third parties. Not just transactions. If they meant transactions in general, they would have said transactions. They're just using words to their advantage. Everything they said is true, Bitcoin really does have a core problem (a problem for them) and transactions to third parties not limited to Mt. Gox, (not limited to doesn't mean that it's happening elsewhere, it's just that if another 3rd party operates like Mt. Gox, then Bitcoin has a fundamental flaw for them too!)

Coinbase charges ~2% for bitcoin purchases. Bitstamp requires that you internationally wire money (Which cost me ~$30 when I did it), plus there is a .5% fee per trade. I suggest you take the dollar amount you would like to purchase and do the math. That will tell you which one has an advantage (As far as price goes).
I do not think 300 is the bottom, but I have a pretty strong feeling that 275 is the bottom. That's unless we get some really really bad news, in which case I could see $180 to $120 coins again. 
I think most people hold bitcoin as an investment, but also use it for transactions at the same time. Holding bitcoin makes me compelled to use it.
Keep reading, make up your own mind about buying. Odds are you won't time the bottom perfectly, so the trick is to only buy a little and forget about it. That way if it the price goes really low it's not a huge deal. 
If you want a good video check out "How bitcoin works under the hood" On youtube. It's the best if you're computer savvy. Cheers.

My Mom died of brain cancer 2 years ago. I took care of her until the end. I wish she were still around to tell me how she feels about bitcoin. I can only presume what she would think, but to be honest, I would be happy with whatever she thought about it, i really wish i could just hear her opinion on anything these days. I just miss her so much. Life isin't nearly as bright as it was when she was here. I'm sorry for your loss. I hope this thought helps you as much as it does me: no matter what, we all will be together one day, weather we maintain our individuality and means of observation has yet to be empirically determined. But the laws of physics still apply, and all the energy that we have stored within us is conserved, we all dissipate across the universe, everyone.

How what can be put in to place? What's a a long ride? I know i'm asking tough questions, but i think this is going to help you more than sending you bitcoin.
You need a clear and consise statement as to what your plan is to help the people of Botswana by integrating bitcoin in their lives, not a referral to become another twitter follower. 
I'd like to offer some ideas to you that could be good for boosting e-commerce in botswana. I'd be interested in what sort of art or goods botswanans make that is a refelction of botswanan culture. Right now, if i wanted to buy botswanan art, i'd probably have to go to Botswana, or find an importer here in the United States. Here's where you come in, you could help set up small businesses where local artists could sell their goods internationally via payments trough bitcoin. This would allow them to join the e-commerce realm, while maintaining independence from banks, allowing these merchants to be masters of their own financial destiny. 
Implement this and it's what we call in the United States a "win win" situation. You win because your quest to help people in your nation could be fulfilled, they win because you help them make bitcoin. We win because bitcoin grows. So maybe it's a "win win win" situation haha. 
Ok good luck. FORM YOUR PLAN! I know you want to start a charity, but you need a "business plan." Do this and it will help you get the funds necissary to "get things off the ground." (get things off the ground is something english speakers say to mean "get things working/going") I apologise if you already know these idioms, i have non-native english speaking friends who are sometimes alarmed by the english idioms such as "break a leg" which means good luck, and "don't look a gift horse in the mouth" which means don't be critical of gifts you recieve because it is rude. 
Best of luck! I mean...break a leg! But really i hope you never break your leg.

I bought bitcoin for the first time, when the price was going down, because it looked like the United States was going to default on its loans. At the time I didn't know much about bitcoin security, I just left them in my coinbase wallet, with a strong password, and two factor authentication. Once two factor authentication was enabled on both my wallet and my email, I wasn't worried about them being stolen. Plus, now coinbase has the cool vault service. 
What characteristics does this average consumer have? Is this an average for the United States, Europe, India, or the world? Because the average consumer in Venezuela has some pretty good incentives to get the fuck out of the bolivar. 
In the United States, the average consumer doesn't have much incentive, but could develop it if there were more and more data breaches, another government shut down, another bail out, etc. 
I fucking hate the bank cartel, taking them down a notch is my incentive. The slaps on the wrist aren't enough of a punishment in my opinion. I want to destroy their bottom line.

There's also tons of people that are creating new technologies, that may be able to apply bitcoin if they get to know it well enough. Even if SXSW isin't as big as the silicon valley in the bitcoin world, it wouldn't hurt for Bitcoin to get more exposure. If SXSW isin't that big of a deal, then why are Allaire, Second Market, and Gavin all going? They must feel like SXSW is somewhat important.

If people were to send $10,000 in bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet in a month, you would see 100% of that. For merchants, fees start coming in when a merchant adopts payment *service* like bitpay that immediately exchanges their bitcoin for dollars (thus eliminating exposure to market volatility), offers a more user-friendly customer/merchant interface, and free/easy integration for a businesses' website. The fees bitpay charge for their services are ~1%, still much lower than credit card fees. An added bonus is that you get your money that day, whereas credit cards take a much longer time to pay their merchants. Coinbase is a similar service to bitpay. Coinbase offers no fees for the first million dollars in business, there's no signup fee, and you get free website integration. 
When *sending* bitcoin there is an *optional* miners fee. Miners confirm transactions, so by setting up a wallet to automatically add a .0001 BTC (about 6 cents) fee, your transaction gets a higher priority in confirmation. Anyone can choose to turn off these fees. In fact, in the recent government auction, the ~$18,000,000 in bitcoin was sent to the winner without a six cent miners fee. lol. 
So yes, bitcoin exchanges can easily be 100% free. For merchants bitcoin payment services add a few cool options, but charge a small fee that still beats the credit card competition. 
In my honest opinion, the low fees and instant access to your money part is great, but the best thing about bitcoin for merchants is that there are no *chargebacks.* Thus negating the exposure to fraud. 
Anyway, hope that answers your question. Cheers! 
Edit: Spelling, grammar, punctuation, added a word. I need to work on my writing.
@_date: 2014-07-05 20:49:26
Yes this is a good point. But in order to be a perfect analogue you would have to remove all transactions not involving the exchange of goods and services. Sites like satoshi dice skew the results in favor of your argument.

Bitcoin is a new tool. If you've ever wanted to subscribe to something online, but don't want to commit to automatic monthly charges on your card, bitcoin offers an escape from that. You can pay for things online just like you pay for things with cash in person. Furthermore, there's no need to enter sensitive personal information when using bitcoin. With a credit card, you really have to put a lot out there, it's scary. 
Businesses get a little more money from bitcoin transactions than they do credit card transactions. I think credit card fees are around 2% on average. Right now bitcoin is at 1% when you use bitpay (they also offer a $30 per month unlimited transaction option), or free for the first million dollars with a company called coinbase. It's nice to know i'm helping out businesses a little by using bitcoin. I don't see why any 3rd party deserves a cut. This is especially true for companies like western union, who charge a lot of money to send money to other countries. With bitcoin I could send billions of dollars for about 6 cents, on a sunday at 10 pm in the desert from my phone.
Spending/owning bitcoin is activism to me. Read about the Libor scandal, and prepare to get pissed. The bank bailouts in 2008 also pissed me off. I don't like how my bank account is subject to confiscation by the government. I don't like how USD is just printed in unlimited quantities, and backed by nothing. To me bitcoin and freedom go hand in hand. Bitcoin offers an escape from middle men who take cuts that they don't deserve. It's also very fun to be a part of something so revolutionary. 
Here's $1 I suggest donating that to charity. Seansoutpost is a good one. It's one thing to recieve, but giving that bitcoin away will really be an eye opener for you. You can either leave that dollar in your tip account, or send it to a different wallet, as a user friendly option i suggest blockchain.info/wallet  Feel free to ask me any questions on how to send bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:24:44

So this post got a lot of upvotes, but most of the comments near the top tend to disagree with you and I. We both understand what a put-off the tin-foil hat lecture tone is we're speaking of, and a lot of the comments here at the bottom would agree too. Perhaps people who would like to see bitcoin fail put on the libertarian anti-fed mask, and hit up public forums like this to build negative sentiment. If i wanted to turn people away from bitcoin, that's what I would do.

It's almost a good parallel, so i'll upvote you. But the difference is that there isin't much positivity in the bitcoin community, this is a real community, filled with nice folks, assholes, neutral folks, and trolls. 
Plus You couldn't sell your doge for fiat. I'm not even sure you could buy a hand-job with doge during a bank run ridden depression. 
Theymos may or may not have done shady things, but that doesn't change all the cool infrastructure that's building around bitcoin. Sheeit.   
I'm sorry you sold. I hope instead of buying and holding you'll just use bitcoin as a means of transfer. I have my buy and hold coins, but I buy whatever I can from newegg, overstock, and tigerdirect, but only when I need the things I'm buying (I didn't really need the gaming laptop, or the home stereo, or the cool 2nd monitor). Allthough i did buy zen magnets today, and i signed up for grooveshark (which is fucking awesome by the way), oh and I bought VPN service. FUCK ME I bought a trezor AND a piper wallet printer.

Good question. Honestly, as of right now I would say that there literally are no benefits for you! None, zip, zilch. But the reason you *should* buy a little is because of the benefits it could provide in the future. Bitcoin can do lots of things regular money can't, so it's useful in a new/unique way. Some people feel like the usefulness of bitcoin has yet to be fully realized by the average consumer, but one day will be realized, making bitcoin more valuable than it is today. This means buying into bitcoin means you're taking a *risk* that it will infact become much more useful in the future. 
I personally find bitcoin fascinating, beautiful, and brilliant. I'm happy that there's something out there that has the potential to give so much more power back to the individual. I think you should read up about bitcoin's potential applications. Forget about speculation, how much it's worth, etc. The things you should focus on are, *why the fuck is bitcoin even a thing?!?!* why are people so crazy about it?!? Be critical of everything about bitcoin, all smart bitcoin enthusiasts were at some point. Feel free to ask me any questions, and i'll be happy to answer any questions. 
Edit: Sorry, I said "you should buy bitcoin," and that is not true. "You might want to buy bitcoin" would have been a better way to say it.

I honestly wouldn't mention the ecb thing. I think it's too much to ask of a newbie to understand the implications of that and if/how bitcoin offers any safety. Plus it's negative, it's probably best to stay positive. 
Ī would focus more on: The MIT bitcoin project and how these engineers of the future and essentially engineers of our future have been given early access to an emerging technology that could suppliment e-commerse, make payments more safe (Insert target credit card reference), and competing with credit card companies by offering a lower-fee/lower-risk option to both merchants and consumers.
This could segway into the ebay thing.
Then you could polish it off talking about how more and more VC money is entering the market, making it easier to get bitcoin through companies like Coinbase. 
So peoples minds do this, "Hmmm MIT huh? Bitcoin future looks bright, hmmm advantages over current system!?.. out compete credit cards!?! VENTURE CAPITALISTS! Give me my computer so I can sign up for this coinbase the man spoke of!"
They'll have a better chance of remembering the website if you mention it last. 
Anyway, good luck on TV!
Edit: MIT----&gt;(Ebay and apple)-----&gt;(More adoption because more people understand the ADVANTAGES OVER CURRENT PAYMENT OPTIONS)(Target)----&gt;(More VC money)(Ie. Horowitz)----&gt;(Coinbase).
sigh, I always have good advice for others, but none for myself. 
Edit 2: Actually I wouldn't mention any advantage regarding risk, that's just begging the reporter to be like "Lower risk? What about this whole Mt. Gox thing, and the volitility(Buzzword)" Just talk about lower fees, that's plenty, no need to swing for the fences, just get on base.
Edit 3: here's some stats about VC investment increase this year 
Edit 4: I almost forgot, I got bullish again when I heard about being able to send bitcoin over facebook to my friends and family. Please mention this. Lots of people love and understand facebook, and this is a great way for them to get excited about bitcoin. I can send money to my friend on vacation in peru while i sit on my couch in texas on a sunday at 10pm with my cellphone nearly for free.

I am being realistic. I would never call someone an idiot after they experience a misfortune, and I feel like if I did it would be a bit cruel. I think we can all agree cruelty is not good, be realistic. 
Edit: Not sure how many people read it before it was deleted by the mods, but right after the gox insolvency happened, when people were calling the people who left their funds on gox a bunch of idiots, a fellow bitcoiner/daytrader posted his suicide note.

Coinbase did a pretty good job for a while. But Circle is relatively flawless. If you don't want a paper trail, buy in person with cash from localbitcoins.com, or there's a mycelium app. I've done the localbitcoins method, usually I just met in a coffee shop, covert nerd status. Congratulations, I hope you enjoy your new found financial freedom. I recommend reading up a bit, you'll see more than just an investment opportunity, bitcoin is a freedom movement. Once you understand the overall theme of bitcoin, it's purpose etc. then you'll be *proud* of your bitcoins, and it will change the way you think about money.

Cool, glad you're interested. If you're using a web based wallet make sure to use Two factor authentication on your wallet, I also suggest using this for any email addresses tied to your bitcoin in any way. Two factor authentication is just another level of security. You log in to your wallet with your regular password, and then you will be prompted to enter your two factor authentication  which is usually a randomly generated number sequence. This makes it so anyone who wants to steal your bitcoins, will have to have both your password AND the device with 2FA on it (Cell phone, Tablet). 
Congrats! 
Edit: Google authenticator, and Authy are both good 2FA services.

*Some* people hate the banks. Others have grown accustomed to bank services and understand the fees. The problem is the topic is negative. If you open up using *positive* terms, like how bitcoin can help small businesses by avoiding excessive fees, then people will associate bitcoin with something *positive.* 
I totally agree with you though. But imagine you were selling bug poison to people, would you first fixate on exactly how the bug poison attacks the nervous system of the bugs, killing them nearly instantly, noting that the wiggling they do before they die is only due to nerves.

The # people who are willing to exchange currency into bitcoin simply due to a company accepting bitcoin has diminished greatly. It remains a speculative currency. Good news is not killing the price, the price is going down due to the realization that the *same type of news* that brought a price increase before is no longer having the same positive effect. 
During the December 2013 bubble Baidu started accepting bitcoin, but this was not the only reason why the bubble began. There was also the budget crisis in the US, which scared a lot of people. Furthermore, the Silk road had just been busted and bitcoins were close to $100.

People aren't only interested in bitcoin to avoid banks. Allthough the loudest people in the room will make it seem that way. Newegg, Tiger-direct, and overstock didn't start accepting bitcoin just because they follow a libertarian ideology, they accept it because bitcoin is a unique payment utility that nets them more $.

I'm a fan of simple, a 1-play to 1-satoshi ratio seems more aesthetic (for lack of a better word), I think your addition is a good idea and might make a cool option. But personally, as a consumer, 1 to 1 just sounds better to me than a divison problem later, with 1 to 1 know exactly how much I spent every song.
Plus, this could be marketed by emphasizing the 1 to 1 ratio, so that way the consumer feels like they're supporting their favorite artists with each play!

The mining aspect is really cool and brilliant. Whoever created this currency had to have some way to distribute it while maintaining its legitimacy.
If he were to give some to his best friends first, no one would want to use the currency because it would be unfair for a few people to start with so much. So instead of distributing the currency himself to chosen people, he decided to just give it away to anyone who was interested. Mining is the way people showed that they were interested in having some bitcoin. 
So then he decided to code the protocol to release the coins in blocks every 10 minutes. If you were mining, you were just trying to solve a simple math problem, this showed the protocol you were interested. If you got the problem correct first, you were awarded the bitcoins in that block. 
At first only a few people were interested, so the odds of them winning the block were very high. Today hundreds of thousands of people are interested, with very powerful computers. So the odds of winning the block are much lower. Still mining remains a way to distribute the currency to whoever is interested. 
The cool part is that whoever created it combined the mining aspect with the confirmation of transactions. So while people try to mine for bitcoins they are simultaneously confirming transactions. This is what allows bitcoin to be self sustaining. 
I hope that clarifies and simplifies what exactly mining is. Today most beginners do not mine. It's much easier to just buy the bits rather than buy equipment, pay electricity bills, and hope for the best. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:15:35
I'm not. I'm anxiously waiting for my skeptical friends and family to finally understand the benefit of P2P digital currencies. I'm waiting for them to realize that bitcoin is not some fad, scam, or get rich quick plan. So many more people know what bitcoin is now, and they know it has *some* value, so the seed has been sewn.
On a different note, I don't think recurring progressively large bubbles are good for bitcoin in the long run. If we had another perfectly timed and proportionate bubble, anyone who bought some during, would know that it would be highly likely to lose value if they held onto it. So in the end, i'm patiently watching bitcoin do the right thing, which is whatever bitcoin does, because at an integral level bitcoin is and always will be an amazing tool.
To me, bitcoin has always had the same value: it's priceless. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:08:34
Yeah i think your right. I was thinking "Bitcoin is to cash, as cars were to horses" and you're right it's not an extremly good parallel. While i agree that bitcoin has added nothing new, and is in fact not bringing anything new to the table, i still believe bitcoin is a new aggregate of modern technological advancements in online payments and cash/cenralized currencies. 
Modern online payment methods lack the permanence of a cash transaction because i can call visa(the central authority) and have them cancel payment if i have a good enough reason. No other online payment system besides bitcoin has the permanence of a cash transaction. Now is that a good thing? That's a totally different argument. 
So there's an example of how bitcoin has taken components of each thing, and combined them to form a new compound. I guess a good way of describing bitcoin is like a new chemical compound. Carbon isin't new, so by your logic, carbon nano tubes are not new. And the cool thing is i agree, carbon nano tubes are not new, they're just a new arrangement of old things...very old things (carbon, sigma and pi bonds, etc). So if cash is graphite, and paypal or visa are carbon fiber, then bitcoin is graphene. Do you see where i'm coming from?
There is nothing new about bitcoin.

Centralization of mining wouldn't be effected by someone advocating for centralization. Mining has been trending toward centralization for a while now, without anyone advocating for it.

Bitcoin is new, and is subject to a lot of speculation, there's no way in hell anything like bitcoin would be stable in the short term. If bitcoin were stable, it would be really weird. There are no sure bets in life. The best thing to do is to look at what bitcoin is and does, figure out if you think it's a good idea, figure out how good of an idea it is to you, and then go from there.

Sex robots. The "female" ones could accept BITchcoin. Oh, and every home should have a 3D printer but more like a *materializer.* TV commercials for kids toys on the character's TVs could have ads like we see today, but instead of going to the toy store, you pay with digital currency (ehem. bitcoin) through the screen and the toy is 3D printed out instantly in the home. :) 
Edit: Assassin-bots. Robots that you could hire anonymously to take someone out. The thing about the Assassin-bots is no one knows who is actually getting the money from all the hits. All the payments are sent to a wallet that contains money that never seems to be spent. People start to speculate that the Assassin-bots have no owner, and work for themselves...dun dun DUNNNNN!

You seem to think bitcoin has more of a chance of getting you a big profit than gambling. Every game has different odds, so when you say you know you're gambling what game do you think the odds are like?
I'll forgo waiting for your response to give you mine: Bitcoin is worse than gambling if you're comparing it to blackjack, certain plays on roulette, etc. I'd say it's probably about as good as playing the slot machines. 
The odds of bitcoin gaining much value in the short term are miniscule. The odds of bitcoin gaining much value in the long run are very small. Don't invest in bitcoin if you're just trying to make money. If bitcoin fits your ethos, then buy some and use some, and by some I mean &lt;1% of what you're worth. You can still be a part of bitcoin and not expose yourself to so much risk. 
Edit: And stop listening to this bullshit about being young and it being ok to take huge risks. If you lose that money you will regret it forever, you will always think about what you could have done with the money. Young people are not immune to this. Say you lose 100K, and you think "It's ok I'm young, I have time to fix things!" Then suppose you fix things and get your 100K back. You would have had 200K if you wouldn't have taken such a big gamble on bitcoin, and you will be beating yourself up when opportunities pass you by because you didn't have the capital to get involved, because you put it all in bitcoin.

Thom yorke of Radiohead is an opponent of spotify and pandora and refuses to put his solo stuff, and the new "Atoms for Peace," on either one of those. He might be a good place to start. But if artists signed away the rights to their own music, then there's not much you can do about that until the contract is up. 
You could also live-stream concerts, which as of now, record companies have to do pay-per-view on tv in order to make it happen. Too much money lost to the tv company. Cut them out all together.

A note for beginners: In addition to not using this type of service, please refrain from using "random password generators." I don't even trust encryption software. Make your own super fucking complicated password. Don't listen to advice like "use 5 random words as your password" because this narrows your password down to words, which are far more limited in variation, than a string of whatever YOU can randomly come up with. Don't mash keys, there are patterns in this too. You need to decrease probability by adding as many different factors you can. Thanks. 
Oh then write it down in pen, and put it somewhere safe.

 I totally understand. It IS dangerous. I bought some items with Bitcoin recently, one was 1200 dollars, and when I sent it I thought... wow I hope he actually sends my item! 
But it does have a few really cool possible applications that aren't dangerous. One being microtransactions. I think something like Bitcoin is perfect for getting around paywalls such as, web based science publications (I hate having to join their club just to get 1 peer reviewed science journal) A pay as you go method, that doesn't require personal information would work great for numerous online business like Netflix, VPN services, Or payments from banner advertisement.
Also, check this out. Irreversible cash-like transactions online are very dangerous for the consumer, but remove risk for businesses. Not only does it remove risk, it also increases revenue for business by a lot. Sometimes 8%, usually 5%. For example, I bought a 1200 dollar item, 5% of that is 60 dollars. I asked the merchant how many items like mine he sold that week with Bitcoin, and he said 6! 6X60 is $360. By using Bitcoin, I helped put more money in that dude's pocket. 
But yes overall this Bitcoin thing is dangerous and is nowhere near ready for mass adoption. Thanks for the compliment, and the conversation. Have a good one!

Rather than thinking of it as 3 cents, why don't you consider that 3 cents to be a % of the persons overall tip fund? 3 cents could have been 50% of what bits he/she had to give. Also, I think one person giving 3 cents is not a big deal, but when you have hundreds of thousands of people giving three cents to a cause, then it can make a big difference. Bits allows people to throw change in a digital bucket, we couldn't do that before.

It can be used to fund accounts instantly, rather than having to wait for a bank transfer. Suppose you like to trade stocks, and you want to add $10,000 to your scottrade account, you will have to wait 2 or 3 days. **IF** scottrade or a company like it would accept bitcoin, you could fund your account instantly and buy stocks right when you want them. 
Today I accidentaly overdrew my account, I had to make a transfer from another bank to fix the problem, my account will be in the negative until the transfer is recieved. If i could fund my bank account instantly, by buying bitcoin with a CC, I could have prevented the overdraft charge.

Yeah, I realized my 8% value was more of an upper limit and rarely the case because most businesses don't only sell $1.50 items. 8% would be an ok estimate for something like a coffee shop or a sticker store. I just don't feel like arguing with those guys. Sure there are no flat 8% credit card fees but my point is still valid at 3% too (plus chargebacks). I read another article that said in 2008 credit card companies made 48 billion in fees, which really gets made up by raising the costs of goods and services. It all came out to &gt; $400 per household per year that we're shelling out to compensate for credit card fees. $400 per household that could be spent and used to boost the economy. I'll find the source and link to it, i'm at lunch and lazy right now. Thanks for noticing my post though.

The cool thing is with bitcoin the artist gets way more by cutting out the middle men.

It's not really a bubble. It's over priced right now due to QE, but I still wouldn't call it a bubble. Look at the dot com bubble for a good example of a bubble in the stock markets. It really needs to go parabolic first, like bitcoin has done a few times, then it's a bubble.

If someone were considering bitcoin, and they think "Oh looks like it's not working out, the price is down over the past year," Then they're not really thinking about it right. It's not a fucking stock, and it's not just currency, It's currency that has a few utilities to it.

Cash, in-person was always a fun and interesting way to buy. I met some interesting people.

Edit: Fed Aims to Hasten Payments
Central Bank Says System Is Fragmented, Out of Date Fed governor Jerome Powell said an efficient payments system aids economic growth. ENLARGE Fed governor Jerome Powell said an efficient payments system aids economic growth.
PHOTO: BLOOMBERG NEWS By RYAN TRACY Jan. 26, 2015 6:12 p.m. ET 9 COMMENTS
WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve wants to speed up and further secure the U.S. payments system, which includes everything from checks to credit-card payments to online transactions, saying the infrastructure is fragmented and out of date.
The plan, released on Monday, calls for coordination among a broad swath of companies that help move money throughout the U.S. and internationally, from banks to credit-card networks to clearinghouses **to virtual-currency firms.** The central bank, which has limited authority over the broader payment system, called on private-sector firms to participate in task forces to coordinate efforts.
It also promised to speed up its own service for settling payments by slightly extending its hours of operation later this year and working to make it a 24-hour-a-day service over time.
The move comes as new technologies are upending the long-established processes for moving money. Digital currency systems, for instance, can now transfer money across the world in minutes, whereas the current U.S. system can take more than a day to process a check.
“Despite high levels of innovation in the U.S. payment system, a lack of coordination is creating fragmentation, inhibiting ubiquity and creating confusion,” said a Fed paper released Monday. “Several countries around the world have already developed or are in the process of developing a ubiquitous, faster payments capability and the United States is at risk of falling behind.”
Fed staff said the plan would help create the infrastructure for consumers to transfer money to one another in seconds, a capability that some companies provide today but isn’t possible for all transactions. The initiative has been given a high priority within the Fed, the staff said.
“A safer, more efficient and faster payment system contributes to public confidence and economic growth,” said a statement from Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell, who will be co-chairman of a Fed committee that oversees the initiative. “We look forward to working with payment stakeholders to realize this vision.”
The Fed said it wants to coordinate efforts by businesses, card networks, banks, payment processors and “emerging payment firms,” among others. Mr. Powell and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George will start that process with a webcast outlining the Fed’s goals on Thursday.

I heard you. Good job! Although it didn't really feel like they responded well to your suggestion that people not always connect bitcoin with illegal transactions, how it has many positive applications. I think his response was something along the lines of "Yeah, and there's lots of these currencies out there so don't worry about just one..." It wasn't a direct quote, but it was a shitty response to your comment regardless.

@_date: 2015-01-12 04:27:08
People might be starting to 'wake up' and sell because they're either afraid it's going to go bust, or want to buy in cheaper. But none of that changes how bad-ass bitcoin is regardless. Price is down? So what? Anyone who thought the price would just go up, or thought that the first decentralized digital currency would be stable is totally loony. Expecting another bubble would have been a stupid move, but that still doesn't make bitcoin a failure, or any less of a brilliant working idea. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:27:08
I agree, there could be an extremely long lull in the price like between the $30 bubble and the $270 bubble. This is ok with me because the developers are really working on some cool shit, and I cant wait to see what they come up with next. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:22:35

A lot of the down voting of criticism come from critics who want to make us look like we down vote all criticism. Think about it. If you wanted to make bitcoin look bad, this would make a good technique. Create and up vote irrational and crazy pro-bitcoin posts, down vote any signs of reasonable criticism, make bitcoin look like a cult.
@_date: 2014-06-04 03:57:24
Yes, a bit low at the current price :) let's hope that changes. But seriously, 10 satoshis per play works too. 
Edit: at the current bitcoin price we would need ~300-500 satoshis per play to be competative.

I believe satoshi thought that eventually the network would rely on transaction fees once the block reward got small enough. I'm not concerned at all, 3 cents, 5 cents, it's all still a bargain for what you get. Heck, sending $50k without the need for anyone's or any government's permission is worth a lot more than 3 cents. 
I started out on the side that insisted on larger blocks, I even ran an XT node, but lately I've changed my mind and I remain confident that 1mb blocks will be sufficient for a long time. If someone wants to continue to spam the market with dust, then so be it, I hope they enjoy wasting money. I'll pay my 3 to 5 cents (for now) and bypass their bullshit any day.

Uhg. For fucks sake. Why does he consider the deployment of XT as a moment where the XT developers tried to "take advantage of" the fear of reaching network capacity? What on earth would the motivation be, where these evil - doers would want to prey on fear to implement a network capacity increase? I mean, either they had something to gain from implementing XT, or they just wanted to toy with the network. What would they stand to gain? 
On the other hand, does anyone benefit from dependency on the lighting network?
Why can't we have a lighting network AND 2mb blocks? If the lightning network is such a great addition, then shouldn't it's incredible value and utility carry over to a 2mb/block blockchain?

I think eth could win both battles. My issue is with people not calling a spade a spade. They're in direct competition for the same use case, and perhaps soon in both currency and smart contract applications. I'm just not a fan of bullshit, not saying you're bullshitting, but there are people who like to pass it off like there is no competition, yet they know damn right there is. 
I think the purpose of that bullshit is for when one or the other takes the lead in some respect. People who support the losing faction can just claim that they have different use cases, so it's nothing to worry about, yet when their side has the lead in another respect they can claim their side is clearly on pace for total victory. 
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:19:53
Ah ok I think I see what you mean, calling bitcoin a currency doesn't even begin to touch the surface of what bitcoin can do, it's a new element. Calling bitcoin a digital currency today would be like calling The Internet the 'digital TV' in the 80's. Is that right?

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:35:28
Hackers can spoof your wifi by providing a separate wifi network with the same name/id. Your computer automatically connects to your wifi when you turn it on, the exploit is when you get the victims computer to automatically sign on to the cloned wifi network. At that point you can log keystrokes, and fake actual https websites. So imagine logging on to coinbase, seeing the https, but really it's a trap. Like phishing, except you're actually on coinbase, and the hacker can make programs to change the sending address to their own, making it seem like coinbase produced the sending address. You could hit the deposit button on gdax, thinking you're sending to gdax, after all it's https, but really the hacker put their own address as the deposit address. That's the way I see it happening.

I like this post, but honestly, you don't really need to buy bitcoin to support it. I remember it being a thrilling experience when I got my first bitcoin, but that really wasn't important. The important thing was that I did research, and began to understand why bitcoin is such an important invention. My stance turned from wanting to own bitcoin, to wanting to be part of what I feel is a movement. 
So sure, you can buy bitcoin if you want, it will probably always have value, but learning about what money really is, and understanding what's going on in global finance is far more valuable.

I think you're getting the wrong idea. I understand that you're not saying the bitcoin community is toxic. My concern was more related to how you were basically saying 'no wonder people consider the bitcoin community to be toxic, when these types of posts spread baseless rumors.' 
You scrutinized the post, but didn't scrutinize a group of people generalizing the bitcoin community as toxic. Why turn a blind eye to that? Do you condone that sort of behavior? Why be so up in arms about a baseless rumor, but be so willing to let a baseless generalization slide?
Regardless of weather or not one person is spreading a baseless toxic rumor, people shouldn't be generalizing a group of folks to begin with. Cheers.

You're right. 100% It's misleading. Cyprus had wealth confiscation from citizens, this is wealth confiscation from municipalities. Therefore greece is not = cyprus at the momen. The title of the post suggests otherwise, that in fact greece = cyprus right now, which is not true, therefore it is misleading. 
The two situations may equate soon, but that's beside the point. Also, even if greece starts confiscating bank accounts tomorrow, you're still right.

I think it's great and I use it too, but I don't think fold is going to work on a large scale. There just isn't enough supply of discounted giftcards out there to sustain fold if millions of people start using it. I could be totally wrong here though, i'm not really certain.

Yes it has, that's what happens when a currency loses value relative to other currencies.


Yeah, over the last year, since bitcoin has come down from a huge bubble. Great job cherrypicking your time frame to fit your narrative. Try to sit back and just take this one in: Look at the increase in value in bitcoin relative to the decrease in value of the euro over the last 3 years. Bitcoin is up 1000s of %, the euro is down big time. Check mate.

The anti bitcoiners are ok with me, even if their reply is just a flat out disagreement without any explanation as to why they disagree. 
The ones that I don't like are the more subversive anti bitcoiners. The ones who pretend to be psychotically overly bullish about the price on purpose. Or better yet, the ones who will set up a post like "I'm selling my house and putting it all into bitcoin, is this a bad idea?" then followed up by ridiculous comments like "Yes because bitcoin is going to the moon!" I dislike them the most because the whole point of their action is to make us all look like greedy conspiracy theory nutjobs, or to synthesize content for r/buttcoin.

I think you're right, that they are just as easily bought with paypal, cash, or credit cards. So i think the real benefit goes to those who are selling their gift cards. They get their money sooner. Typically if you sell a giftcard to a giftcard buyer/seller, you have to wait for your check to come in the mail if you want to get the max $$ value out of your giftcard sale. Taking bitcoin allows people to get that money sooner, probably instantly in some cases, and therefore spend their money sooner. Instant gratification.

I'm not sure if cash is the best idea, the euro could lose a lot more spending power. Gold or silver would be better than cash, because it holds it's value in currency crisis situations, it's easy to transport in case you need to be mobile, and it's value is known everywhere you go. Problems occur when you start trying to move a lot of gold, because when you cross boarders you need to declare that gold. Bitcoin has the disadvantage of not being as liquid as gold, and there is a higher volatility due to the much smaller market cap. Bitcoin has the advantage of being invisible, no need to declare the 20 word pass phrase in you head when you jump on an international flight. So yes it would be good for sending money to someone abroad, but it's also becoming better and better for transporting money yourself, without having to send it to someone else.

Why on earth would anyone do that? It just seems like doing it for the sake of manipulating the growth rate of daily transactions is just really obvious. I mean, if they are, they're not going to be fooling many people for long. 
Manipulating the transaction  could be used to benefit the perception and viability of bitcoin, but it could also be made to be a detriment to bitcoin as well. By obviously manipulating the transaction volume, some people might throw that in the evidence bin that the success of bitcoin is just a bunch of smoke and mirrors. I think would be considered some type of false flag.

Why are you blaming the bitcoin community as a whole for the spread of a rumor? Comments like this just seem like a poor attempt at a character assassination. I think you should be more concerned with *yourself,* because generalizing a whole group based on the actions of a few is not a smart or level headed thing to do.  
Edit: From the continued conversation below, plus some more thoughts.


Some may consider a post of this 'type' a reasoning to generalize the bitcoin community as "toxic," but YOU'RE the one who is providing the justification for that prejudice. You did not explicitly disagree with the generalization, rather you made an implicit agreement by justifying the generalization.
Further thoughts: The best parallel I can draw would be if someone said "No wonder people think the black community is "toxic" to this country, there was absolutely NO BASIS for rioting after that trial." See how It sounds like i'm condoning the generalization of black people in america? 
Edit 2: You scrutinized the post, but didn't scrutinize a group of people generalizing the bitcoin community as toxic. Why turn a blind eye to that? Do you condone that sort of behavior? Why be so up in arms about a baseless rumor, but be so willing to let a baseless generalization slide?

A lot of stuff keeps me interested, things like when I look at the news and hear about bankers not going to jail for theft, or central banks continuing their currency manipulation.

When the hack first took place someone made the comment that the best thing the hacker could do with the bitcoin is to give it back to bitfinex for a large fee. Treat it like they found a security flaw, took the bitcoins to protect them so that someone else wouldn't abuse the security flaw, then returned them -X% (some reasonable amount like $250,000).
I think the reasoning behind why this is better is that it would be harder to remain anonymous and spend the bitcoins they stole. Instead they could walk away with a lot of legit/legal money, maybe even go long on bitcoin before the news breaks...etc.

What were the amounts of bitcoins sold in each auction? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:00:48
We're not in a bubble until you start seeing $100 increases in a day. The auction may bring the price up if it gets a lot of press. It also depends on who bids. If someone like donald trump or michael jordan win the auction, then the auction is going to raise the fuck out of the price.

I think that phenomenon happens when an individual is too caught up in this idea that bitcoin will replace the dollar or all fiat currencies. I used to be like that, but then started thinking of it more as an internet of money/digital gold, and that most likely fiat currencies and bitcoin will coexist peacefully. 
After all, bitcoin is an entirely new animal, it's hard to compare to anything else, so simply stating that it's better than fiat and thus will replace fiat comes from a place of ignorance, where one is not considering what a unique tool bitcoin is in its own right.

Yes, spend and pay homage to this beautiful network. Spend at places that directly accept bitcoin, and preferentially spend at places that keep some or all of their bitcoin holdings. Baron fig keeps their bitcoin (not sure if this has been confirmed via blockchain), and it has now rewarded them. Spend at newegg, spend at overstock, donate to charity. Say 'fuck the system' and donate to Rand Paul from an outside country, or divert your vpn to somewhere outside the country and donate, just for funzies. 
Buy coffee from the Vietnamese coffee place (who probably wish they would have held, if they didn't). Buy from novel coffee roasters if you want whole beans. 
Get VPN from privateinternetaccess even if you don't need it, just for the fuck of it. It makes you sound really smart if you say things like "I couldn't set up my wireless IP camera today because I'm running a VPN." I can hear the stampede of women coming this way right now.

Even if the point was to make money, it's still not a scam unless there is fraud involved. All I'm trying to say is that dogecoin was not a scam, I'll agree that dogecoin sucks, and was a stupid copycat coin, with a founder who figured out a way to get rich by copying bitcoin in a clever way, but there was no trickery involved, people adopted it because they thought it had real potential, or because they thought it was funny. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 23:11:50
It does not *have* to be bitcoin, it's just more likely that bitcoin will play the role as the major cryptocurrency because it is established, trusted, proven, and most importantly adaptable.
Bitcoin is open source, so anyone can review the code and make changes to it. Core Developers can modify and have modified the code of bitcoin to do new/different things. Bitcoin has the ability to evolve, so something new could come out that's better than bitcoin, but that thing will be new, untrusted etc. It won't matter bitcoin can most likely just adapt to do that same new thing. Bitcoin can't copy all new things, for example, there are only going to be 21 million bitcoins ever, some people feel like that's too few, so they made new currencies that have more units.

Nice, I think you'll really dig it. The price is right. I have 2 ledger wallets and 2 trezors. I also have a piece of aluminum with a encrypted private key laser etched on it.

I think to be fully reasonable, one must consider the fact that we may not actually be in a bubble equal in magnitude to any of the famous bubbles. This may just be a small price rise.

@_date: 2015-03-31 19:57:27
The whole case against him has lost a lot of credibility in my opinion. He's guilty if the prosecution can prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury. Federal agents commiting crimes throughout the investigation induces more doubt. Now it's the defenses job to make it look like there is a reasonable doubt that he's guilty, similar to the OJ trial, there was tons of evidence against OJ but no smoking gun, is there a smoking gun for ross? For OJ the glove didn't fit, that was enough to be a reasonable doubt. Would the threats against ross' from the undercover agents cause ross to act in ways he normally wouldn't? This is turning into an amazing case to follow. I'm so excited right now, but i'm losing focus on my work, why must this happen during midterms!!!???

Best way by far, is to produce a bip38 encrypted private key on an offline device, this way the private key that shows on the paper wallet isin't the real one, instead it's an encrypted version of you real private key. Now your private key is password protected. This can be achieved by using a piper wallet, or using tails. Piper wallet is by far the best choice for the lazy. 
Then, if you're worried about fire, get a crypto card, which is a "paper wallet" that's laser etched into a piece of aluminum. If you're worried about theft get 2, 1 in a safe place and 1 with a trusted family member or friend.

Well we might need some of the services that banks offer. Not sure if it has to be your typical bank that offers those things in the future, but credit cards and loans are nice. I think a better way phrase the comment would be:
Banks: We now use blockchain technology to arbitrate transfers and to secure our accounting. 
Customers: We don't need you to arbitrate transfers/transactions and I would rather you not gamble wi... store my money for me anymore. If I need to start a business I'll come to politely ask for a loan. Now that I've been waiting in line for 10 minutes, can you cash these rolls of quarters and dimes for me? Thaaannnks

This could work for smaller amounts, ~$1000, but would not work for very large amounts at the current market cap, because the spread couldn't absorb a huge buy without the price going up.

Honestly, i think this is a terrible ad :/ i'm probably not alone with my feelings. It looks like something a 17 year old would think was a good advertisement, because him/her and his/her friends think it is so funny, but in reality it doesn't fit what it's trying to sell, and it just causes confusion as seen by this thread. Someone get this goddamn mess off of reddit ASAP. 
EDIT: I think it's ridiculous that this is being downvoted so much. Don't you think a different viewpoint ads to the conversation? Or should i only agree when i see something i think threatens us? I'm sorry, i think it's a funny ad, but funny ads sell things like car insurance, etc. you can make a funny ad once you've gained more traction. Mastercard didn't come out with a comedic ad campaign first. No, first they came out with a serious one, probably involving trust. Trust Mastercard. Not, magic money card.

They'll transfer money to your localbitcoin wallet, then you can transfer them to any wallet you want. It will not happen instantly and here's what you should do: Meet the guy/girl, initiate the trade, have them send the bitcoins to your localbitcoin wallet, if they offer to do anything else just say no, not sure why but just keep the whole transaction on localbitcoins to be safe. Now you wait until you see the BTC in your wallet, should take 20 minutes. Do not hand them money until you see BTC in your account, if they're not willing to wait through the "confirmations" (which are basically a waiting period while BTC is transferred) then you should not be willing to give them $$$. When i did it, i had the money out so he knew i had it, but i wasn't going to give it to him until i had BTC in my wallet. Once you see it in your wallet the transaction is done. 
Edit: sorry, initiate the trade (hit the buy button on localbitcoins.com), then meet them, wait for BTC, pay the person.

Dude, i've used coinbase AND local bit coins. Coinbase is the way to go...usually. But you're going to have to wait a week before you can even think about selling them...with local bit coins and a cash deposit you're looking at paying 10 dollars over spot price, BUT you'll get it within 3 hours. It's up to you. Local bitcoins is legit, just get someone with a lot of feedback, if you're uncomfortable buying a bunch at once, buy a little bit (lol) to test the waters.

It's hard to say "i'll buy on the next dip." I say that to myself, but the thing is...usually what causes a dip is something that I am concerned about too. For example, i really wanted to buy some tesla stock, and i was like "hey i'll wait for the next dip." Then the tesla fire thing happened, and my immediate concern was that there would be a recall. So, i hesitated, and i did not buy during the dip. :(

Well if you auction them then they're probably going to go for wholesale cost. Meaning the bitcoins may total $60,000,000 in value, but the people bidding know once it sells bitcoin is going to drop a little, so the highest bidder will probably only pay 20-30 million for it and make a cool 10 mil. If they sit on it good for them, if they dump it, good for them. I really don't care either way. I just want to increase my holdings, and 150 would be nice to see again :) 
@_date: 2013-10-25 04:16:08
Yes, thank you. They're going to want to squash this bug before it mates anymore. But will they accomplish this goal? who knows? amiright? I mean it threatens everything. As much as i want bitcoin to succeed, if it does what everyone wants then most americans are going to have to buy in pretty high...that would make a lot of hard working people...poor. That's not good right? I know we can sit here and bark, well they should have adopted bitcoin early blah blah, the fiat blah blah, but still, people would really suffer.

You're right, sharia is used in a lot more contexts than simply forceful implementation by terrorist groups. For example, Sharia degrades women, promotes homophobia, and gives people justification under god to continue to commit crimes against humanity. And you're right bitcoin being assosiated with sharia law doesn't *necessarily* make it associated with a terrorist group. But if it were used to transfer funds to a terrorist cell then it would. 
"Bitcoin used to fund Hamas bombing killing 38 civillians"
No it's more like saying bitcoin was used to send funds to the 911 hijackers leaving no paper trail to the people who funded them. The whole point is for you to imagine the media shitstorm that would occur, and then re-think about how great it would be for bitcoin if EVERY(including every bad guy) muslim to use BTC because it fits so well with their religion. If EVERY muslim used it, then EVERY sharia touting terrorist would use it.

You should sell your initial investment, that way you eliminate risk. Keep your profits in the game. Your girlfriend will think you're even smarter. 
Don't worry about convincing them to invest. Right now is the WORST time to invest. We are at the highest ever, over 1000, to the point where every bitcoin is essentially a nice lightly used motorcycle. Take a look at the charts, we're in bubble pop territory and lots of people are in denial.

Don't fall for this shit. Do you own research, there are plenty of books out there on any subject you want to know about. Why do you think there's so many people telling you to buy gold?

But i think it's ok for a little while at least, keep in mind if the drive fails, goodbye BTC, if you have a lot, do the right thing and make a paper wallet. Experiment first with making a paper wallet for small amout of BTC, and then recovering that small amount of BTC.

You should just do a cash deposit from localbitcoins.com all you gotta do is follow their directions, initiate the trade (click buy), go to that bank (bank of america, chase, US bank...etc) The seller will tell you which of those banks it is. You'll deposit money into their account, the seller will then (or in an hour or so) send you BTC.  The BTC will go into your localbitcoins wallet. Bam, you're done. Whole thing takes about 2 hours.

We may not see eye to eye, but you have to admit that ad has a downside, and could have been better thought out. In fact, we should raise some BTC to pay a small marketing company to DO IT RIGHT.

The site is great! I just bought some catnip bubbles and cat treats as a christmas gift for my girlfriends cat. 
Suggestions: The transaction went very smoothly, but have you thought about implementing coinbase? I think the first 1,000,000 in sales have no fees. The only reason why i say that is i've done transactions through them on other websites, and it was really smooth and awesome. Having to send to a random address leaves room for error, coinbase removes that risk. 
I also wish i could have sorted the dog food by wet/dry. I'm assuming the cat food has the same problem. Thanks and good luck with your business! I can't wait to try these bubbles out lol.

Hey it's all about how YOU feel. If you think it's going to drop to X then wait. IF you think it's going to go up, and then drop to somewhere around 300 and stay there then guess what, now's a good time. I really think there is still upward movement in the short term. Yes longterm it will drop, but i think sub $200 BTC is a thing of the past. Maybe sub $300 will be too. In my honest opinion, you should buy 1, the most likely bad scenario is that it drops back down to 250 and you're out 50~100 bucks. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:54:08
Yeah they don't have bank accounts and have a hard time buying the stuff considering it's nearly impossible to get on an exchange without one. The target demographic is businesses, if i own a business and i see that ad, i'm gonna question the legitimacy of bitcoin, and let's face it, legitimacy is EVERYTHING. So they can downvote all they fucking want to, but maybe when they grow up a little they'll see that when your going to advertise to millions of people, you don't do it so goddamn poorly.

Now take your average joe and put my original headline in front of him...still think it's a good idea to associate bitcoin with sharia law? or do you think that maybe it's better to get this thing rolling a bit more before we insist it fits best with a morally flawed system of law.

Bitstamp. You'd think it was hard. But actually signup took 15 minutes, and my deposit went through in 48 hours. Paid $80 to the bank to deposit $3000 but now i only pay .5% per transaction to bitstamp. Fuck coinbase, they fucked me so hard. They were late on withdrawing from my bank account, and they decided it would be a good idea to charge me for all my purchases, before sending my sales, so it overdrew my account, and they confiscated 1 BTC (when the price was $1100) that i paid 800 for. They literally stole $300 from me. And won't answer my emails. Going to sign up their support for every spam email thing i can think of. Have fun with your porn spam assholes.

I think the probability of him being ok with it is very low. 1st of all you're assuming he needs to get his rent faster, when collecting checks and taking them to the bank only takes a little bit of time. That little bit of time is a waste, but the perceived risk involved in accepting rent through this "new fandangled bitcoin thingy that my tenant told me about" far outweighs the time he loses from collecting checks, and dealing with bounced checks. This is all assuming that you aren't buddies with your land lord.

I understand that fear, but wouldn't it be ok to just buy the gift, and then immediately replenish your stash? Furthermore, you should think about WHY BTC has gotten where it is, we not only have ourselves to thank, but the businesses that accept our currency. If you think about it, it's these people that have given you this gift. Now you can return the favor by simply purchasing something weather it be a small or large gift is up to you, and giving it as a gift. Odds are you're gonna have to give gifts anyway, why not make it a win-win-win situation?

Instead of using amazon, perhaps it would be better to do business with a company taking the risk of directly accepting btc. I Mean if you think about it, they've really scratched OUR backs, I just think this holiday season it's a good time to scratch theirs.  Just get something small, anything really, chocolate etc...something small you can give to your mom or dad, sister, brother, or close friend.
Edit: Sorry i overlooked the fact that Gyft does take the risk I was talking about. I'd like to amend my statement and thank Gyft for being so rad. However, it would be really nice to see more Commerce going directly to small BTC supporting businesses, rather than amazon. Amazon hasn't done much for the community.

Check out coinbase, and bitpay, they have little to no fees. I think coinbase does 0 fees for the first 1000000 in business. They also have the option to instantly convert to USD and deposit to your bank account so you carry no risk. Buying/selling BTC with coinbase costs 1%. They also host a wallet service.

It takes a week with coinbase. But you can do instant transactions once you complete a transaction (with the 7 day waiting period) and then wait a month. However, if you buy with coinbase now, you'll lock in the price at the time of purchase, so what you pay/recieve will not change as the price fluctuates over that 7 day waiting period. Local bit coins is the way to go if you want them NOW. It takes 3 hours max. I got my bit coins within 5 minutes of payment on my last transaction. I would refer the buyer but he is "on vacation." These local bitcoiners ARE brokers, they're running their own business, and some of them even use business accounts. Honestly, if you feel like 175 is a good price and are willing to pay 185 to get it now, then use localbitcoins. It will work out, and what I did was transfer my bit coins from the local bitcoin wallet to the coinbase wallet. (will back them up soon, physically, in my safe, on a thumb drive)

I'm on a post having to do with Sharia law being assosiated with Bitcoin. Boku Hiram is a terrorist organization in Nigera trying to impose Sharia law on the nation, one of their means of leverage is through terror. This is only one example, so i think it's fine to talk about terrorism on a post talking about Sharia law. This "not all muslims are terrorists" stuff was just unwarranted. My comments have an assosiation with the topic and therefore are fine as they stand. Furthermore, it's probably not in bitcoins best interest to be assosiated with such a devisive issue. Currently Bitcoin is a young and easily stigmatized currency. It's not in bitcoins best interest to be assosiated with Sharia law, and any organization imposing sharia law on people.

If the bitcoin dealers are smart, then they're hedging. So they buy an equal amount after they sell, and make their money by having a spread. Market goes up they make 10 dollars a coin sold, market goes down they make 10 dollars per coin sold.

You're swinging for the fences. Please don't give this to him, you're just going to create a skeptic. No offense or anything, but just from personal experience every time i push bitcoin on someone they just get skeptical. Now i just say, "Have you heard of bitcoin?" And if they say yes then cool, have a convo, if they say no, don't turn into a used car salesman. He'll get wind of bitcoin soon enough. Until then you can still pay your rent in good old fashioned greenbacks...right? Oh and no personal info...phil.

I'll do my best. Hype and fear aren't exponential. But hype caused the exponential $250 bubble last year. Look at the chart, it went from a nice ~linear increase, to what looks like the graph of y=X^2. I also remember there was a lot of hype about bitcoin at the time. Fear can cause the same thing, just think about crashes...exponential decrease. Hope that made things more clear, like i said, i don't know what i'm talking about but it's fun to discuss things. And yes like the growth of an organism. Whoa, that's cool to think about.

Yeah i think we're starting to blow the bubble. I'm wondering if i should pick up a few more before it goes haywire. If it is a bubble, i think this time when it pops, it will settle back down around 138 and never go below that again.

I think the best thing to do would be to go psychological on their asses. So don't talk to THEM about bitcoin, mention bitcoin when they're near you to someone else! Don't try and promote it, just talk about it. The goal is for them to hear the word, and think "Heyyy people are talking about this thing...maybe i should do something so i don't miss out on an opportunity...". I think its better to do that rather than talking to them directly and trying to SELL the idea of bitcoin to them.

If you're truly long on bitcoins you wouldn't sell regardless. Plus, the demand is too high now to see sub $200 bitcoins. 300 feels like it is the new 200, which was the new 120...and so on. We may see 250 or 280 again in my opinion. And the ball is just beginning to roll on this. Media is STILL picking up attention and more and more companies are starting to accept BTC. However, do your own research, formulate your own opinions, and don't expect anyone who says their holding to actually do so. It's the wild Wild West right now. If this is like the 1848 gold rush, then it's 1849 right now in my opinion.

If the US tries to bring BTC down, china will push BTC like crazy. The senators won't allow the US to be left in the dust. BTC is gonna coexist and find a niche, even if that niche is gambling and drugs, BTC will survive. Coinbase might not though. Lol as soon as one of their account holders goes on a drug crazed killing spree, they're done.

But then again...it would be really great if apple came out and said they accept bitcoin. Seems like the 2 ideas are conflicting. For one we want apple to accept bitcoin, on the other hand we don't want apple to hire a guy to make an alt coin and then accept that alt coin?

Agreed but the 1.6 billion figure OP threw out there was for every muslim. I've got muslim friends who don't like sharia (actually in my honest opinion, I think a vast majority dont want sharia law) But if we're playing "lets pretend all muslims adopt btc under the premise that it adheres to sharia law," then we're also pretending 1.6 billion muslims want sharia law. So that's the frame of mind my comment came from, not a hateful or generalizing place. Sigh, I take things way to literally, it's becoming a problem in my day to day life.

Don't forget a credit card offers well...a credit card. I can spend money i don't have, unlike bitcoin. I see this as a major drawback for bitcoin seeing as it would be extremly hard to lend it. Lending makes the world go round.
A consumer wouldn't want to give up those protections. In the future if more and more people start accepting bitcoin, you'll see more and more cases of consumers getting ripped off, and bitching about not being able to get their money back. Bitcoin is cool, but like you said it's like buying stuff with gold. Accept the difference is if i go to the grocery story and buy something with gold, at least i know who and where they are, so when my goods turn out to be shit and i want my money back, i know where i can walk in, and find a muthafucka. With bitcoin, if i get ripped off buying petfood from some dude in alaska, all i can do is write an angry letter, and wish i'd used a credit card. Bitcoin has its niche, it's a temporarry vessile for money laundering, evading currency controls, gambling, and buying drugs. All of these things are on the backs of the legitimate businesses that accept bitcoin.

All you're going to get is answers telling you to accept bitcoin because it's great. We can't tell you anything that's going to make the market less volatile, that's just a risk you're going to have to take. However, most of the exchanges Ie. coinbase, offer instant transfer from USD to BTC and BTC to USD...so as long as you don't hold them then there's nothing to worry about. OR you could hold them considering the new bottom that seems to be forming, the more popular it gets, the more valuable it becomes. So good luck with your game! And i recommend you not take too big of a risk, in the end you have to go with your gut. Edit: a word.

i bought back in at 850. Not selling anymore. This shits about to get real. It's gonna get adopted more and more, so even if you buy at 900 vs. 500 thats's not that big of a difference when you think of the potential value of one. Keep in mind they may even move the decimal point soon.

Yes but if facebook embraces bitcoin they put themselvs in the position to make a lot of money off it. Think, if they just charge .0001 like the miners fee per transaction, or less once that gets changed, they could make a ton of money in a new innovative way. This would set them apart from google, which is what everyone in the stock market thinks facebook is...the next google. 
Look at what they have in common: Google started out as a search engine that sold ad space and everyone thought "How the hell are they ever going to make any real money?" Now look what google is doing, all sorts of things OUTSIDE of search engines. They have an OS, they bought youtube, google glass, the self driving car, google maps, google translate. Google became the HUB of all that is the internet, and look at their stock price, over $1000 US. This all occured due to innovation, and the kahones to not try and predict the future, but to MAKE the future happen. 
        
Now look at facebook. They have a billion users, and everyone is thinking the same thing, "How the hell is facebook ever going to make any *real* money offering a free service, and just selling ad space?" Note the facebook stock price at ~$45. Now if they just saw the potential of what bitcoin could ADD to that they could push innovation, and create the future just like google did.
Facebook can't just make an OS or a Phone, or a device, or a self driving car, its been done, they're stuck. But imagine if you can facebook not only being the hub of where you keep your social interations, but the place where you keep you finantial interactions. I could check my bitcoin balance, and see how chad is doing, ask chad if he wants to go to the ball game, head over to the redsox facbook page, buy tickets to the ball game, post what i'm doing this saturday so everyone gets jealous. etc.
Bitcoin IS the special ingredient facebook needs to become a powerhouse like Google. Bam, they should hire me.

I would love to spend them. But, it's hard to buy the essentials with bitcoin. I don't need to buy electronics and alpaca socks. I need toilet paper and windex.

Hi Adam, Coinbase user here, i love the layout and think y'all have a great thing going on. I was actually trying to do some shopping tonight using bitcoin, because i want to get as much money moving through the bitcoin economy as possible. The problem was that just about everything on the merchant list is stuff that is nonessential. Here's what i think would be great: I want to be able to buy my essentials with bitcoin. Toothpaste, household cleaning supplies, toilet paper, etc. I really think it's important that THESE things be readily available to the bitcoin user. So this way i'm fueling the bitcoin economy by buying things i would buy anyway rather than wasting bitcoin on nonessentials like alpaca socks and electronics. I don't mind spending my bitcoin (and therefore having to buy more bitcoin) to pay for the things i need...the bitssentials.

I agree with you but i just don't couple it so hard with libertarians. I think profiteers are using libertarianism as a shop window ornament. That being said i'd like to say it's nice to see some folks on here who aren't all hidden-agenda to-the-moon anon-get rich quick asshats. I'll admit, i bought gold at 1600, like a sucker, because i was scared, but learned a lot, lost $4000 in the process, but was able to see things from a new perspective after it was all said and done. Just look at the commercials on fox in-between news shows. It's gold commercial after gold commercial after gold commercial, they're literally preying on old people and it's sad, and psychologically twisted. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 14:18:05
It's great to have high hopes but 1000...That's a little far fetched. The nice thing about BTC right now is that everyone can play, if it gets that high people will feel alienated and won't buy anymore. BTC needs to stabilize in a comfortable area around 150. This is fun, lets make our predictions. I think we'll reach new highs, resistance where the last bubble popped (as people finally get their money back) a pop around 300   a dip down to 100, dead cat bounce to 180, and settle in around 150.

"VISAcoin couldn't be decentralized since they'd want to keep control of it" 
You're assuming they want to actually make money on VISAcoin, when in fact no, they would just want to destroy bitcoin. So spend 100 million on ads to save them a billion in the long run? Easy to do. All you have to do is scare people/businesses away from bitcoin.

Good news is wallets are free. Blockchain.info is a good one, but if you buy a bunch you should look into a "paper wallet." As far as buying goes, I suggest going onto  and doing a cash deposit. You'll pay ~10$ more than market price per BTC but you'll get them instantly, as opposed to waiting a week with coinbase, bitstamp, etc.
