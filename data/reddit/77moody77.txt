What exactly goes on in your head when you ask a question like this? Who do you expect to answer this? The Oracle?
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:44:03
From 3 to 10 people?
The fact that they don't mention any real numbers tells you enough. 
The topic title is also completely ridiculous. 
An article written by bitcoiner to hype other bitcoiners. It's all part of the pump.
It's just so pathetic to watch. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:27:05
Bitcoin isn't a safer alternative. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:42:04
Haha wtf?
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:25:56
So the "epic" part the OP was talking about. Is that about the price or the epic help?
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:48:44
Somewhere dark, smelly and moist. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 18:07:25
Yeah, the Euro stops working during weekends. Nobody is able to use it and they obviously should switch to Bitcoin instead. 
Ok. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:57:33
Haha that whole article is nothing but wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:43:01
Why? I thought this was all about helping Greece and not about the price. That's what i just read in several threads. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:56:01
And next you wonder why so many people can't stand Bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:44:49
Yeah. Somewhere close to 0. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:13:50
Good thing it isn't about the prices around here. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 17:53:36
And so does the Euro and every other currency out there. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:48:58
Nothing is happening. Nothing other than bitcoiners pumping and pumping. As soon as you get out if this sub you'll notice that absolutely nothing is happening. Zero. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:37:55
Nobody, absolutely nobody, as in not one person there is gonna barter for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:57:26
So Bitcoiners are creating fake Greek profiles now to pump the price? Fuck me. This is just too much. 
This is some of the most ridiculous shit i've seen in a long time. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:12:37
No. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:55:18
I must've missed that part. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:25:56
They aren't. They really aren't. Can we please just stop with this nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:46:24
Try a different sub. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 21:42:30
Common sense. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:08:26
Wait, i thought this sub was all about helping the poor Greek people? Why would you be happy if the price goes up?
@_date: 2015-07-05 09:51:41
Like Dogecoin? Ripple? Litecoin?
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:30:59
Oh give me a break. The second it looked like Greece would implode and millions of people would suffer this sub turned totally euphoric. 
You are obviously aware of this but as you're goal is as well to get rich off Greece (or any other event that can pump your coin) you are perfectly fine with. 
Stop putting up this show. It's pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:50:01
Most of my downvotes come from me pointing out uncomfortable facts and not joining the pump. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:26:55
The Greeks should switch to any one of the 100's of alt coins. Which is perfectly fine with Bitcoiners as they just want to help Greece and not use them for their own gains. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:11:47
Yup. The whales will once again take advantage of the Bitcoiners here. It's hilarious to watch. It's the same thing every single time. For 2 years now. And every single time they fall for it. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:24:49
Riiight. Now it's 12 to 15 months. 
How many of these nonsense predictions have we seen by now? 500? 1000?
It's always next week, month, year with you people. 
In 12 to 15 months when nothing happened you will pull another date out of your ass. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:40:55
Translation: "i want the price to go up so posting non stop pump posts is fine"
Surprising. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:27:21
They are all very valid points. It makes a lot of sense. 
The only reason you call this a crap article is that you are holding a bag of coins and want the price to go up. I can almost smell your desperation. 
Also the 18 month "bear market" has nothing to do with manipulation and everything to do with not enough people caring about Bitcoin. But this is also something your little fantasy world will reject. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:45:24
Based on what? This little pump and dump? Tell me you have something better than that. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 18:45:16
What a dumbasses. If only there was a currency where you can be your own bank. 
Like Dogecoin. They should've bought Dogecoin but now it's too late. Hopefully other countries will learn from this. You have to be real ignorant not to put your savings in Dogecoin. 
The downvoting and irony is hilarious. You people are so desperate. So amazingly desperate. Unbelievable. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 19:44:51
Yes it's digusting. Just as the majority of this sub wants to see the Greeks suffer so they can pump their coin. 
This gets weirder and scarier by the day.
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:58:22
What large group are you talking about?
And do you realize that during every single pump in the last 2 years people here were saying this time it's different?
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:45:45
There is absolutely no evidence that this is the case. You just pulled that fact out of your ass. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:30:54
But when i call this a pump and dump i get downvoted to hell. 
There are more traders active than there are buyers in Greece. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:01:22
Funny how you edited to make it look like a joke. 
But really, how stupid do you feel now?
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:06:46
No they don't. No matter how many times this gets reposted. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:47:41
Are you high? Look at the post you replied to. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:04:38
Let's not play this stupid game again. Read my first post. 
The same goes for Bitcoin. The coins don't just magically appear in your wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:16:13
This being yet another pump and dump like every other price rise in the last 2 years even more. 
But yeah, this time it's different. Right
Edit: when by next week the price is down again will all you downvoters come back to upvote me instead or just ignore it, act like this didn't happen and move on to the next pump?
@_date: 2015-07-05 17:46:56
No they don't. And even if they did it would never ever EVER be Bitcoin. You won't get rich off Greece. Believe me. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:14:02
Article doesn't add to the pump? Check. --&gt; downvote to oblivion. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:04:50
I'm not even gonna answer something so obvious. 
The desperation here is reaching insane levels. 
Anyway, as always you will see the answer in a few days when the price is back at 250. Which you will completely ignore and act like this never happened. And then you will look for the next thing to pump and believe that this time it's different. This time the price rise is real. And repeat...
Just like you and the rest of this sub have been doing for 2 years straight. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 00:35:46
I nowhere said anything like that. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 15:18:38
How euphoric are you right now?
@_date: 2015-07-06 08:18:06
You're here every single day. You know shit gets reposted over and over again. Why didn't you check the page before submitting this? You really think this wasn't posted many times already? This completely off topic news?
@_date: 2015-07-06 15:03:42
I don't see you going around tell the non stop pumpers to calm down. Why's that?
@_date: 2015-07-05 07:17:13
Don't be ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 13:42:49
How many more people are paying with Bitcoin in the last 2 weeks. 
How huge is current Bitcoin adoption level in Greece (last 2 weeks). 
How many coins does your grandma own?
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:02:47
Heading towards 10k? Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:34:53
The end goal for every Bitcoiner. Cashing out their mad profits in dirty slave statist fiat dollars. These threads are hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 16:37:18
Sure sure. You altruist you. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 20:53:40
This time it's different right? 
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:03:12
Wtf are you talking about? How can you just completely switch to a different subject like that?
May i suggest you start reading from the top again and then post instead of this nonsense. 
Here, i'll make it easier for you. In this specific case (a few posts above) what does Bitcoin solve that Paypal doesn't? If the answer is "nothing" then man up and simply post that instead of writing a wall of text trying to change the subject. It makes you look desperate. 
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:14:48
Yeah, pumpers would never take advantage of a situation like this. Never. 
Have you disproven me. Damn! 
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:44:49
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:29:43
I have no crystal ball. It's just common sense. 
If the price goes up it's because of traders doing yet another pump and dump. And that will be all. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:14:48
Nah, my little bagholder. Next stop down again. Just like after every other pump in the last 2 years. Your life must be filled with dissapointment. 
I know how entitled you feel. You convinced yourself that you deserve to rich because you're "hodling" a few coins. The future has a lot more dissapointment coming your way. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:13:38
And what does it solve that Paypal doesn't exactly?
@_date: 2015-07-12 13:02:11
Yes. But don't remind them they have been claiming this for years. They don't like that.
