I think this only provides pseudonymity at best.
I believe the OP's point is that pretty much **anyone** (ie. any private company, any government, or any private citizen) can destroy this "anonymity" by developing analytic/data-mining software that looks at the full public blockchain.
The more connected an organisation is (eg. big internet companies, ISPs, governments, exchanges) the more input data is available to link your real-world activities to your Bitcoin transactions. Increasing the number of Bitcoin addresses you receive funds at, just means the analytic tools we are talking about just have to look a few extra steps forward/backward in the chain (not computationally difficult). In addition you will eventually have to spend those coins (either with a merchant, or at an exchange) and by doing so possibly lock in a section of the transaction graph. (depending on the trustworthiness of the merchant/exchange)
It may be possible to use a bitcoin laundry - but then our hypothetical business has just taken on a *different* counter-party risk.
Try this [blog post]( for crash course on the topic.
...Personally I find Zerocoin very interesting academically, but it might be too much to hope for it being implemented in Bitcoin. However there seems to be a few such solutions bouncing around in the community right now. Like the OP, I think it's really important that we start making this a priority in the discussion.
