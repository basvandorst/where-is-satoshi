Not a huge amount...I was trying to sell them at $18ea. They were the proceeds of mining.

Pretty much how it went down for me too. Lost 44btc
@_date: 2016-04-07 21:35:30
Well I did, they were the proceeds of mining and I transferred them to mt gox to sell :)

Yeah I had 44btc on gox that got stolen.  Granted I did have a sell order in place which I was waiting for, so I can't complain really.

That also means people will be paying maximum interest on purchases made with actual credit cards (ie. Not a visa debit etc)

That's unpossible!

I lost 44 bitcoin during that.  I had a sell order in anyway so it doesn't really matter, but still.

I got this email as well.  I really hope it's legit, waiting to hear back again.

I always used  when I couldn't find something on nzbmatrix...I guess I'll be using it full time for now
@_date: 2019-01-04 11:17:01
Me too. I lost 44 and gave up on bitcoin at that point. Motherfucker!
@_date: 2015-11-15 08:20:03
I lost all of my 44 btc a while back thanks to the Mt Gox hack.  Never really got back into it :(

They're afraid of it because they either just don't understand it or don't want to...any they want other people to be afraid of it too.

I know your pain.  I had 48 BTC taken from my MtGox account last year.  Many months of mining gone down the drain in a single transaction.  Shit happens hey!

I've sold a bunch of Ubiquiti wifi products and they all come with their own POE adaptor (as opposed to standard power pack).
