Thanks all for the great discussion — we learned a lot.  Closing out the thread for a while to consider the feedback.  Have a great week!

True - if uncontrolled.  We would penalize account holders who spammed (ie, failed to attain a minimum engagement rate from their friends).  So they are motivated to send relevant messages to appropriate contacts only - otherwise it would cost them money.  It actually makes spamming harder since this is the platform that traditional spammers would be competing with.  Also, it would likely make brands compete for end user engagement (each brand offering higher rewards).  That is our objective - better authentic engagement for brands and proper respect for value end-user brings to process.  Thanks for the comment :-)

We expect that the closed beta will go live in the next day or so at  where users will need to request an invitation to participate by sending a note to invite  We think a few hundred testers will get us the feedback we need to prepare for proper launch.  If you need more info, just drop me a line anytime,  Thanks again / much appreciated.

Here you go.  :-)

Absolutely.  Working right now to button things down.  
And thanks again for the quick/valuable lesson on Reddit :-)

We are testing this type of platform already with tokenized gift card points and need to know which crypto currency communities (if any) would value a similar service.  We think it could be a good way to establish a floor on how brands re-value their user relationships and put a bit of extra cash in the wallets of regular non-crypto enthusiast users.  But if an existing crypto currency community would have problems with it we need to know (at least as much as possible).
For instance, making BTC embedded ad GIFs might be a great way to get most Americans (Mom &amp; Pop) to create and use a BTC wallet (frictionless-ish tied to an email account let’s say).  But at the same time, if 200M BTC wallets popped up and were used regularly, does that make BTC more or less likely to be regulated by the govt?  I would think less since the voters would finally understand the power of BTC and demand full and unfettered use.  But it could cut the other way.  Law of unintended consequences.  
So we are asking for feedback - good and bad - from the folks that would know best.

Just accepted Moderation.  Thanks again -- we owe you one!

This is a great comment - and sheds light on a big question we have had in our minds pertaining to a core mechanic designed to respect the view you have shared.  Thank you for your candor - very valuable and appreciated.
@_date: 2019-09-16 00:34:36
Well done - I’m sure you are inspiring many others��
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:39:09
Happy to send you links.  The docs are currently behind our Euphoreum.com firewall for registered testers only, but your request is very sensible.  So please give me a moment to grab the PDFs and get them into a open access setting (Dropbox is easiest for me today since I’m traveling / driving).  Thanks for your patience / stay tuned...
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:54:31
Apologies for delay.  I’m traveling today / just operating from my phone.   Doc links posted to your earlier question / comment above.  Thanks again!

We’ve never considered ourselves a potential spammer, but it’s good to have your view as it is an important consideration to always hold in mind.  As a practical matter, we will never encourage a user to spam anyone.  If the message is voluntarily sent and gladly accepted by a known recipient (with rewards going equally to both sender and recipient), we think we’ve created value add for all involved.  If the recipient does not want it, we will endeavor to make sure their wishes are respected.  Thanks again for the input.

@_date: 2019-09-29 15:52:09
Maybe.  That’s why we are asking now.  If it’s a better idea to not launch a BTC wallet feature, we would prefer to figure that out now. ��
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:59:18
Will do.  Thanks again for the time / guidance :-)
@_date: 2019-09-30 07:26:23
Agreed - we absolutely wouldn’t want someone to get a branded message from a friend if they didn’t want it.  As mentioned earlier, we will enforce protocols to make sure traditional spammers stay off the platform and cultivate mechanics where this is a known person to known person mechanic.
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:20:39
Fair enough.  Would value hearing your concerns if you have time.  Thanks either way :-)
@_date: 2019-09-29 15:38:12
Thanks for that - much appreciated.  Sounds like you are definitely not going to be in our target market then :-)
I also recall there being a use case discussion in the early Satoshi threads about attaching BTC to personal email to make it too expensive for spammers (you only open a message that hs a high enough “postage stamp” value on it).
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:45:46
We would agree.  But innocent people also tend to proclaim their innocence as well.  :-)
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:44:44
Exactly - spammers would never choose this.  But legitimate references might.  But testing data and community feedback need to be collected for us to make an informed decision.  Thanks for the comment :-)
@_date: 2019-09-15 20:03:43
That's awesome - thanks.  Yes please.  How do I manage?  Sorry for not being very Reddit savvy -- just figuring it out now.
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:20:17
I’ll be on a long haul flight in about an hour and will be unable to answer any questions until tomorrow.  But back soon / thanks again for all the valuable feedback.  We are listening :-)
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:57:48
We have no interest in the sh*tcoins for numerous and obvious reasons.  We instead want to build something that demonstrates the true value and sustainability of legitimate crypto currencies.  But we have to be realistic - building a service for a particular community that doesn’t agree with the value proposition is not the way to go. 
So your honest feedback / assessment here is very valuable to us as we try to assess the potential for all likely community stakeholders.  And we thank you for that :-)
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:11:30
Not a scam.  But the fact that you view this as a potential scam is a big deal to us.  If backed by credible community partners, would that assuage your concerns?  Thanks again.
@_date: 2019-09-29 16:48:49
Thank you for your comment - it is appreciated :-)
@_date: 2019-09-15 19:48:44
The longer term plan is yes (v2.0), but for test purposes we are creating tokenized brand engagement points that can be redeemed for complimentary gift cards.
