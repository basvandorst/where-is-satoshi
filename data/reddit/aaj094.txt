If your objective is to trade while not believing in bitcoin then go ahead and use the strategy you think makes you money. But if money is what you really want to make, you are warned that 5 years from now, there is a high probability that you will look back on your short trades and lost holdings at this level and rue the amount of money you didn't make by HODLing.

You raise an interesting point. Even if there is value, the fact that something like bitcoin now exists means that game theory will ensure that individuals will have incentives to put capital into harder money than weak govt fiat. This is regardless whether you think there is larger good in govts having control over monetary policies.

Those who adopted early took a risk and ultimately were part of the reason acceptability increased for a superior form of wealth like bitcoin. So it is incorrect to call early adopters as having not contributed anything. 
Your argument can be made against any traditional passive investor too who puts their capital at risk and earns the rewards of that capital turning out productive. Active contribution is great but it is not the only way progress is made in the world. Progress is a function of capital and labour. For example those who invested in Apple's ipo in 1980s and held till now are very rich but would you argue they contributed nothing except getting in early? If all those investors did not put in their capital then perhaps Apple would not have taken off.

You just got lucky that's it. One could have taken the same view in beginning of Sep last year at 5k and been smug about it in mid Sep when price retraced to 3k. Only to look like a dunce again in a matter of 3 months. 
Hence there is no point feeling smug about one successful trade. If that's the approach then looking at the wider history of bitcoin, argument would be bulls favour game set and match. 
Instead I like to rely on qualities of Bitcoin to argue why it is set to go higher.

I think it is also because of possibility of a fork of that coin resulting in 2 versions of bcash. A real mess I would say if that happens but some punters feel that such splits result in getting free coins so the fomo to get a piece of the action. 
If you really want a piece of that irrational action, you could try to buy some bcash and sell it a few days before it splits. It is a huge risk though because at the end of the day it is a shitcoin and a trading decision to take advantage of irrationality can come back to bite you.

Something that is good money should ideally not have other uses which can interfere in its usecase as money. So whatever you mean by 'intrinsic value ' or lack of it is actually good for bitcoins use case of money. 
We don't have to hope for miners. The incentives in bitcoin through fees and block rewards automatically incentivise miners without needing any hope. 
You talk of thieves and that can happen with cash and gold too. At least in bitcoin, you have the flexibility of keeping things very inconspicuous and controlling multiple keys which no one can know about. So easier to have plausible deniability. 
No sign of govts in most parts of the world trying to actively obstruct but even if they do, they will find it difficult to control the peer to peer nature of the coin. Yes they will tax it but I am not saying you should look at bitcoin as a tax evasion technique. Pay your taxes.

What was the trigger though in 2015 for the recovery from the 200/300 range? I think it was mainly because the bears ran out of steam and supply passed to hodlers.
Back then the 200 to 300 range was what 6k to 8k appears to be now. And no real trigger manifested that took it out from this range. Just happened with no one really expecting it. Same with $5 to $7 range in 2012.
I think the reason is simply that hodlers eventually capture the majority of a limited supply and from then on the speculative ups and downs have less and less of an effect until upward pressure prevails. That then sets of fomo and upward pressure reinforces the situation. The tide finally turns only after the rise from previous base becomes so huge that even a good chunk of the old hodler base starts selling if only due to prudent risk management concerns and a desire to book at least some profits. This is when the fall starts and this where we are now. It will continue until majority supply again passes to the next batch of hodlers.
These cycles will continue until adoption reaches so high that hodlers will no longer wait for a very huge rise before selling part of their stash and also when the coins become so widely dispersed that selling by few individuals no longer impacts price by too much. Thus the volatility will decrease.

There is no such thing as dormant dollars nor can is there an equivalent of a blockchain where dollar balances or their transaction history can be seen. So your comment makes little sense. 
But let's say all but 1 bitcoin were considered lost. Then all the market cap can converge on to this 1 bitcoin. But if the view on whether some of the remaining bitcoins are really dormant changed one fine day due to some news then the price of btc could crash. This uncertainty could kill the viability of bitcoin once a good proportion of btc become dormant.

Keep thinking of it as a pure currency and I agree one can get caught into the cycle of thinking you are caught in.

Well I guess you may have also shorted during the time bitcoin was stuck in the 200 to 300 range in 2015. But obviously you wouldn't let us know how that one went, would you? After all, things actually did look a lot bleaker at that point than it does today not just because of price but because of the mt gox hack, much lesser mainstream interest, etc.

Exactly. It is staggering how people prefer to trade bitcoin short-term for some dollars of profit (actually even that often turns up a loss) when they could do easily HODL and make a magnitude higher amount in a few years. 
I will excuse the guys who lost out in this way in 2012 and 2015 bear markets because bitcoin was truly in untested waters and a lot more uncertain about the whole experiment. But now after knowing that this is tried and trusted technology and immensely difficult to shut down, future suckers who lose out due to myopic view will have no excuses. They will look back with salty eyes wondering in their middle or old age.. "what on earth was I thinking when I sold my bitcoin for those few dollars"? They will come back to these reddit posts and further punch themselves for ignoring what would seem even to them obvious on hindsight in their middle / old age. You are warned and you have been warned!

Yep. Just like 1.2k peak of Dec 2013 never recovered after bitcoin dipped to $177.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:27:40
There are a lot of people who are aware of BTC but do not own btc. The fomo can actually be quite high this time but only once it becomes a bit obvious that reversal is taking place. I think the first shoots of that effect will take place when 5 figures are achieved again and then stronger once 12k breaks. People who are waiting aren't going to wait for the peak to get in.
People do avoid knives that appear to be falling but at the same time, it is foolish to expect that they will wait all the way until the peak to get invested again.
The peak was 19666 and the repeated support line so far is 6k. If that holds then I would say a good estimate of fomo point is the geometric mean which is around 10850. This is where the % gain from bottom is equal to the % gain remaining until peak. So kind of the rational point of entry for those seeking uptrend confirmation.

One simple way of quantifying is to realize that bitcoin embodies many of the attributes of gold and in fact improves on most of them apart from the utilitarian value of gold (which btw makes up only a tiny fraction of the market value of gold). Therefore you could project the long term market cap of Bitcoin to tend towards the observed market cap of gold today (roughly $7 trillion). With this market cap, you divide by the bitcoin supply and you get a figure of around $400k per bitcoin. 
This is just one way to quantify the future value of Bitcoin and I like it because this directly values the store of value usecase that I described to you earlier in another post. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 12:24:26
Let me tell you one more thing. If at all some superior decentralised tech outside of bitcoin comes up, there is good reason that it will be distributed to existing btc holders. That is the only way a new coin can hope to not be dragged back by bitcoins network advantage. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:58:10
I would like to think that most serious hodlers keep their bitcoin in their own wallets. Not your keys not your bitcoin is one of the basic must - knows about bitcoin. So I would say those numbers are largely representative of what we are looking for. 
Also if indeed a lot of individual bitcoin holders are keeping their coins in exchange then those numbers are actually showing you less dispersion than there actually is. That's because all the exchange balance is probably getting lumped into few addresses and appearing in that table in one of the higher balance buckets.

It ends when enough supply passes from speculators into the hands of hodlers. This is inevitable with the limited supply and passage of time. Eventually the upward pressure will overwhelm these dumps. I don't want this to happen too soon as I want to accumulate for a while. If it shoots up now sure I make money but not as much as I would if it stays low for a while and then shoots up. With limited supply, upward movement is inevitable at some point. Exactly the same mechanics which drove the recovery from the 90% and 85% falls in 2011 and 2014.
The way to beat this seemingly frustrating period at its own game is to DCA.
@_date: 2018-09-11 07:59:56

Agreed and for a while that was the fear in December. But it turned out unfounded and BTC is again the leader. So it is more likely that the other limited supply shitcoins bite the dust. Also, where will this magical new coin come from and why won't that development happen to bitcoin itself? You might say govts or big corporation like Apple, Facebook may introduce a new coin with great marketing but then that coin is never going to be as decentralised and uncensorable / unconfiscateable as bitcoin and hence will not really be a bitcoin replacement.
The only feature I see bitcoin struggling to introduce is fungibility and again I do not see why a large centralized entity like a govt will introduce a truly fungible coin. Hence I also put my money in Monero.

To be honest, unlike the 2014 and 2015 bear market, it is not the case that bitcoin is continuously falling this time. Rather it has been bouncing but with lower peaks off the same 6k support since Feb. That pattern wasn't there in 2014 and 2015 where the fall seemed bottomless without support.

Being a store of wealth itself is a utility. Any other accompanying utility is just added benefit but will not compensate for any lacunae in the primary use case of 'store of value '.
If you doubt that Bitcoin acts well as a store of value tell me please how you could store wealth securely in a way that is unconfiscateable and involves no physical storage and costs negligible to transport anywhere across the world in minutes. Add to this where the supply cannot be manipulated by any govt or event. And where the item in question does not decay over time or get physically damaged. And where the item is infinitesmally divisible with no inconvenience.
This has been an important use case to humanity from time immemorial.
Before you say 'any crypto', think hard what securely means. 
As for the criteria you have listed, bitcoin is difficult to acquire (being strictly limited in supply) and impossible to destroy. Possibility of losing keys or getting hacked is not a counterargument as gold too can get stolen. As for your third criteria, I have argued above that no additional demand via some other utility is necessary for something that performs the 'store of value' usecase well.

DCA is the way to go. Daily if feasible. Then you cheer every day like today like you do if your neighbourhood shop hold a discount sale for a short period. Then your buy price hugs the curve tightly and you land in green within a very short period of recovering from the bottom. Just like how DCA hodlers starting at the Dec 2013 peak were in the green from Nov 2015 - just three months after the bottom. If you started DCA in Dec 2017, your average purchase price at the moment is around $7.8k so you could be in the green within weeks or even days. Brutal bear market throughout the year?
DCA makes you enjoy the volatility rather than frustrate you.
@_date: 2018-09-12 19:00:20
Although often quoted casually, there is indeed some logic behind the reasoning that a dip is required for the next sustainable rise. It is to do with coins getting distributed into a larger number of independently controlled wallets. This usually happens during big falls when people panic sell or long time hodlers decide to cash out at least partially. Both of these dynamics don't quite play out in a rising market. Once coins change hands and into larger number of hands, the next rally sees lower sell pressure than it would have seen if no such fall had taken place. That's because the coins are now more dispersed with less at stake for average individual hodlers and also new buyers do not have the history of the previous fall's agony so not itching to sell. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:54:58
If you are convinced about something, always better to accumulate when others are not showing much interest rather than when the world is euphoric. On the other hand, if you are not convinced about something, you should not be buying regardless of whether others are showing interest or not.

And gold is accepted in coffee shops?
It is your mistake if you think the primary usecase of bitcoin is going to be coffee payments. No, its main usecase will be that of store of value and to be a crypto asset that is valuable through scarcity. And yes, success is this usecase will also make it the choice of payment mechanism is certain special conditions where finality of payment without needing intermediaries is of high importance. Coffee shops and micro payments are use cases that could be served but far from what is necessary or imminent for bitcoin to succeed.
You need to think for a few seconds. If you fiat in your pocket or contactless card, what incentives do you have to spend the bitcoin rather than fiat on your coffee? On the other hand, do you have incentives to store wealth in an asset whose supply is absolutely fixed? Also if you are buying property from a seller abroad where a large amount is at stake and you have doubts on finality of transaction, will you be incentivised to receive bitcoin? Think of all these situations independently to see which are core cases and which are fancy ones.
Tldr: coffee payments by btc may become widespread but if they do, it will be the last rather than first stage of bitcoin adoption.

It is nobody's case that bitcoin is as accepted as store of value as gold today. But an objective comparison of properties makes it a good candidate of achieving that usecase and competing with gold tomorrow. For such future projection, why would one say that bitcoin necessarily needs something that gold empirically does not have i.e. widespread acceptability in everyday transactions?
Infact a token competing for store of value usecase will naturally struggle to find everyday transaction usage because of propensity to HODL. When given a choice, anyone would prefer to pay with something that is  considered weaker as a store of value. So unless there is a special situation, why would a user not choose to pay for grocery with normal fiat than with bitcoin? This is why any store of value will struggle as everyday currency. They are kindof contradictory use cases.
Special situations are a different matter and we are actually seeing examples of BTC being used in some high value transactions.

 For a bitcoin owner who loses their keys, why does it matter whether the bitcoin is permanently lost or whether it got transferred to a new owner?

Here is a gedanken experiment. Imagine bitcoin starting out but somehow being a very stable asset from the beginning of its lifetime. It steadily and gently keeps rising with only gentle dips (much like how the newbies would ideally like it to behave). Consider the consequences now. Whoever now bought such a well behaved bitcoin would hodl without fear and would have simply no incentive to sell at all or to even attempt trading. Why bother when you are gaining steadily anyhow. Result would be that such a bitcoin reaches a very high value but remains heavily concentrated in the hands of miners or whoever managed to buy. All these holders are sitting on huge wealth without worry because bitcoin is so well behaved. Now one day some large holders finally decide to cash out and sell a good chunk. This reduces market price and for the first time induces fear in some other holders who also then decide to take profits. This thinking spreads and very soon a huge quantity is dumped as it was owned by only a few holders who feared losing a good chunk of their wealth. Thus the very high priced bitcoin finally crashes hard. 
Now how might things have been better or the crash softer for the same high priced bitcoin? Well it would have been so if there had been a lot more holders with most sitting on modest profits that they were not that jittery about. In this way, neither would people have sold so much nor would there have been a coordinated dump by a few. 
But how could such a state have arrived? Only if the route to the high price had been attained by interim cycles of fear and hope which triggered continuous exchange of Bitcoin from one set of holders who cash out a portion through fear and another set of buy at lower prices out of hope. Only through a few such fear/ hope cycles would you reach a state of high priced bitcoin that is not as susceptible to a massive coordinated dump as the one in our initial gedanken experiment. 
The conclusion being: the cycles of fear and hope that we see is the only way in which a limited supply of bitcoin can disperse into a state that makes a high priced non-volatile bitcoin sustainable after a few cycles. Something to think about for those who say bitcoin can never succeed because it is such a volatile asset. I argue on the contrary it can never succeed without such volatile cycles because the coins wouldn't then disperse enough for it to become a success.

It is not if you took the time to understand why bitcoin is unlike any other asset and why it cannot simply be replicated as many seem to casually say so.

Data does not bear out your statement though. Take a look at this blockchain based data on bitcoin distribution.
It is not entirely foolproof due to number of addresses is not quite the same as number of owners but still reasonably as good data as we can get.
To check if bitcoins are still being dispersed, I regularly look at the % of coins in the buckets 0.001 - 0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, 0.1 to 1 and 1-10. Right now this is 0.12%, 0.72%, 3.28%, 8.82%.
Take a look at what it was back in October and November last year when bitcoin was at the same price level as now. Here is a snapshot from 13th Nov 2017 when the price was more or less like today:
We see 0.1%, 0.62%, 2.81%, 8.36%. So we have reached a better susainable price than when the same price was reached last year. If you go to October of last year, the improvement is even more stark.

I am a bitcoin fan and yet I think its core usecase is never going to be that of a currency. That does not mean that it cannot be used as currency - just that its role as a currency will always be second fiddle to its role as a cryptoasset. Do you see an inherent contradiction in what I say? If so, what is the contradiction?

Adoption as a payment mechanism does not by itself make a coin high value. Fiat is used widely for payments yet actual wealth stored in fiat is a fraction of wealth stored in other hard assets. 
A high value coin must provide some advantage for wealth that stays put in that coin. Merely acceptability on transactions is not it because you could always switch to the transactional coin when wanting to make payments and retain wealth in the coin where storing it made more sense.

 But also know that in the context of the larger history of bitcoin's price movements, buying now could very well be considered 'buying low'.

Thought it might be cool to post a link to the Daily discussion thread of 6th Nov 2015. This was close to the bottom of last bear market. To be precise, there had been some recovery from the bottom but not enough to convince most that another dip was not going to happen again. Price was around $350.
And here are the links to the Daily for the rock bottom date on 21/8/2015 (flash crash to around $170) and the next day 22/8/2015:

Monero not only keeps transactions private but also keeps your wealth private. There is good reason why people may choose to keep wealth stored in monero. It is literally the only coin other than btc where I see advantage for someone to hold the coin. For btc the reason is security of wealth while monero provides privacy.
Coins which boast of fast transactions can be taken advantage of by holding just during transactions. There is no reason to hold these coins more than a minimal amount just because they provide fast transactions.
Scarcity of a coin and hence high price is a function of how much people prefer to hold a coin rather than by how much they prefer to transact in it.
Ergo.. price advantage with btc and xmr. I find these to be the only two coins worth HODLing. I do hold bits of other coins but the objective there is to 'get more btc' eventually. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:24:04
What makes me confident? The use case that I mentioned and the fact that I don't see any alternative that promises to address the same use case. Merchant adoption and use for everyday transactions is good to have but not part of that use case just the same way as gold is not supported by merchants for day to day payments. I see bitcoins value predominantly as a wealth solution with transactions being a supporting bonus use case.

You may or may not be positive about the future of bitcoin (like I am) but I am sure you notice that there is a dedicated hodler base who is. And if I follow a rigid DCA accumulation strategy then I am sure many others are too. Even if such users are a tiny fraction of overall users, it means that every passing day results in bitcoin supply slowly passing into the hands of this base who don't assess bitcoin by just price sentiment. 
Given that bitcoin has limited supply and the coming halving will even further cut down new supply, guess what this diminishing free float will eventually mean for the price. The mechanics here differ from what happened in the previous bear market only in scale. In the meanwhile technological and infrastructural progress in the bitcoin ecosystem continues and lubricates this process.

@_date: 2018-08-30 19:02:05
 Let's say it remains stagnant for 10 years and then a bull run finally arrived due to the vast majority of supply at that point being firmly in the hands of hodlers who diligently accumulated in the interim. When this bull run does a 10x (very typical and even being conservative  based on every observed bitcoin bull run), you would then see 10x in 10 years. 
Does even this seem like a bad deal considering almost every other traditional investment?

Bitcoin 'doing very badly '. You speak as if the technology is somehow not doing what it should be. Market cycles in bitcoin have no real correlation to how bitcoin works - a simple look at bitcoin price history will tell you that.
Honest question - in November when you bought, did you have any idea at all what you were buying or was it just based on 'price going up?
You need to get a grip on what makes bitcoin different from any other asset in human history and also from other cryptos. Then talk about 'doing badly'. If the qualities of the protocol do not convince you then fair enough but just pointing to a market cycle and saying bitcoin is failing or doing badly is to be extremely myopic.

If it goes lower then make hay and accumulate while you have the chance. It all depends on whether you are convinced by the use case or not. If you are then you should be happy to get an elongated accumulation period. If you are not then why did you consider bitcoin to be a good investment vehicle even while 'price was going up'? Did you decide that something becomes a good investment vehicle purely based on a supposition of sustained good sentiment?

Keys can be kept concealed much more easily than any physical object can. You have the control to set up any number of keys and have plausible deniability of ownership. Can you have plausible deniability of a physical object or bank account?A trezor being stolen or lost does not result in you losing coins if you have backed up keys. 
As for Tether, I won't try answering that one because what you say cannot be proven or unproven. In any case that part has to do with the state of market infrastructure today. Let's say we have a world of only decentralised trading where no tether is used. Then your objection on bitcoin goes away? In other words, tether is not some feature associated with bitcoin but something part of the market today. If you are critiquing bitcoin, stick to critiquing features associated directly with bitcoin.

I buy a fixed fiat amount worth of bitcoin on a daily basis and it has now become a habit. I like it when the price goes down because I get more BTC on my next purchase and I like it when it goes up because my existing stash is worth more. Helps that such regular purchases can be done at a click of a button on your phone. 
Why do I do this? Because I am convinced of how bitcoin is unique and useful as an asset and transaction medium and I don't need market sentiment to make me understand this.
If you did this strategy starting Dec 2013 (peak of last bull run and start of multi-year bear market), you  broke even as early as nov 2015 which is just 3 months after the bottom was reached.

DCA is the way to go. Daily if feasible. Then you cheer every day like today like you do if your neighbourhood shop hold a discount sale for a short period. Then your buy price hugs the curve tightly and you land in green within a very short period of recovering from the bottom. Just like how DCA hodlers starting at the Dec 2013 peak were in the green from Nov 2015 - just three months after the bottom. DCA makes you enjoy the volatility rather than frustrate you.

The justified price of bitcoin at any given point of time is a function of its distribution. If distribution is concentrated, price will tend to tank and oscillate until distribution comes to a state where most of the bitcoin ends up with hands capable of hodling. Then price goes up and keeps going up until again HODLing capacity of the holders wanes due to sitting on large profits. Then the cycle of decline and oscillations starts again until a new stable state of HODLing is reached. This is the single most important factor that has driven most of the bitcoin peaks and valleys. 
Not very easy to figure out what the distribution is like at any given point. You can get blockchain address balance distribution stats but those are not the full story either as addresses do not equal holders and also do not reveal the holding capacity of the holder.

@_date: 2018-10-31 17:43:32
Your thinking was flawed. Even in theory, it is impossible for bitcoin to just keep steadily rising and reach the steady state of gold market cap. Reason is that doing so would not facilitate distribution of the coins more widely and thus cannot make the higher price level sustainable. In other words, too few people will be sitting on too much bitcoin wealth if such a continuous appreciation occurred. 
This is the main reason for the peaks and deep valleys of bitcoin price enroute to the steady state. The price fall is far from worrisome. Infact it was only to be expected albeit timing your sell to take advantage of this pre ordained price mechanism is not easy at all. So HoDL.
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:09:59
True but what I tried to explain is the factor that essentially drives the demand and supply of bitcoin at any given moment. 
For example, why is it that bitcoin appears stable at $6k today when it remained stable at $200 for so long in 2015? It is because in 2015, a lot of people owned 100s of bitcoins and some 1000s. Now very few do. That is why the price today can sustain at 6k while being totally non-sustainable in 2015.
Price will start climbing again only when most existing hodlers end up selling such that few even own more than even 1 or 2 btc. This shakeout is what is achieved by these big bear markets. And this is also why bear markets don't end quickly. It takes a while of decline and stable bottom for a new steady state of sustainable distribution to form.
Now with this knowledge of the mechanism of the market, you might think you can stay ahead by holding on and sure we can try that. But in a game of who blinks first, someone always looses. So the game is really who gets tired of hodling. The ones who hold on will eventually see gains when the recovery occurs due to others having sold and made the distribution better.

It is true that news of a future event that seems highly probable to occur normally gets priced in. But the exception to this rule is when the news is about enablement of more money to flow into bitcoin through institutional enablement.
Even if everyone is fully aware of this going to happen, the full impact will not price in prior to the event because you need money to price an asset and without the money, it just cannot get priced.
Therein lies the importance of Bakkt and other institutional solutions that will make it easy for big money to flow in. No, this has not and cannot get baked in to the price now even if you know this is coming.

The shitcoins that these forks were are slowly but surely dying out. Some can have minor use cases and others may continue with the use case of gambling that sustains most crypto shitcoins.
The pristine Bitcoin blockchain is one that will always have a distinct identity by virtue of being the first and also the most secure crypto. It also benefits from the network advantage. Increasing number of forks and coins might be a concern for any of the other myriad coins but this factor does not bother me in the least about diluting the value Bitcoin itself to any great degree. You can see this at work right now with 1800+ coins on coinmarketcap and yet the market piling into bitcoin and raising the dominance ratio throughout this year. 
I know this ratio was once 90% but that was before the altcoin market had any kind of mature existence at all. The fact that the dominance ratio again climbed after an alt craze like last dec shows that Bitcoin has an absolute special place within crypto and won't be susceptible to dilution by any fork or altcoin.
There is also the point that any coin that can even hope to get past the network advantage barrier must be a fork of Bitcoin and if this is the case then again holding Bitcoin is safe as you would gain ownership of the forks as well and thus lose nothing even from the dilution.

I agree. I always look at these two use cases separately. 1) store of value like digital gold 2) everyday transaction currency. 
Note that the first is what lifts the price up. The second may well follow from the first but also may not. A govt issued fiat cryptocurrency has a good chance of becoming the defecto for usecase 2 but in no way can compete on use case 1 with bitcoin. 
I am not sure why many seem to think a crypto either has to achieve both or end up as nothing.

At this point of time, the investment thesis for bitcoin is also to do with rise in price due to being in early stage of adoption.

When bitcoin is fully adopted then yes, it will behave more like gold and be negatively correlated with interest rates.

This is an article on bitcoin price movement in mid Sep 2015. This is right at the point from where the recovery began but you will notice that the tone of the article is very similar to the situation prevalent now. Just replace the 200 to 300 range that this article talks about with 6k to 8k of the present scenario. 
In particular, this note in the article matches current concerns quite well:
"Overall, the market is split between the beginning of another bull cycle, or the threat of lower prices sub 200. $200 – $300 range has been difficult to get out of, as price keeps coming back to retest support at $ 200."

I have some serious doubts on how to interpret some of these numbers like 5.5% of population touched bitcoin. 
Total number of addresses with greater than $1 worth of bitcoin is something like 15 million. Even on Jan 6th, this number was just about 20 million.  That does not look like a lot unless you say that a very significant number of people hold their bitcoin in exchange addresses.

Recovery happens due to new Joes and not due to more investment by the same Joes who bought at peak. The new Joe is not feeling any pain and is actually going to compare the price now to ATH and feel vindicated in buying now. And there are vastly more 'new Joes' yet to buy crypto.

Many were sceptical at 6k because a capitulation event had not yet taken place. Now perhaps the sharp decline and rise in high volumes may be just that. But you may well ask: Why did so many think that only after a very sharp decline and rise could a full recovery happen? I mean why couldn't recovery just have happened after 8k or 6k without needing one event of a very sharp decline? Here is my take on it:
Two things happen on a very sharp decline like last week:
1. Many who bought at high prices and were increasingly frustrated by the declines reach their threshold of frustration and sell off. They get replaced by new buyers who have bought at a low price. The new buyers are much less likely to want to sell off on further rises during recovery than the earlier ones who would be eager to recover some of their lost money. 
2. Long time hodlers who have a very sizeable stack bought years ago at low prices may have been sitting on a fortune at the peak and as the price declines, some may have the fear of losing all their gains which changed their life. Although they are seasoned hodlers, at some level, it becomes a very difficult choice to come back to a day job or retain what is still a decent amount of money. Infact we all saw one example of such a person last week on this forum who saw his wealth reduced from 2 million to 400k and thus ended up selling his stash on Sunday.  So the net effect is that a sizeable number of bitcoin that were held by few individuals suddenly gets distributed amongst many small buyers who were nibbling away at the order book at lower levels. This helps bitcoin become more distributed.
A more distributed bitcoin is a state that can sustain much higher prices because individual buyers are less susceptible to then be able to dump large amounts. 
But there is no way for Bitcoin to reach a more distributed state without a shakeout of a capitulation event that forces, via fear,some large hodlers to dump their coins. 
A few people's loss thus becomes the gain of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole and therefore after the shakeout of last few days, any price we now see is a much more healthier and more sustainable price than when we saw the same price prior to this dip event.

I have been studying the Google trends chart. This log chart is particularly helpful as this is the only way to see the whole picture instead of one huge spike. 
Now as I have often mentioned earlier, one has to be very careful interpreting the relationship between price and search trends because they feed on each other. That said, one uncanny takeaway I see is that the price at various bear market bottoms for Bitcoin has been proportional to the square of the search index prevailing at that time. Search index on the link above is defined as the search multiple from 1/1/2012. 
So if you look at the boring lows of 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and even late 2016, you will see that price has been very closely proportional to the square of the search index during those periods. But the relationship very quickly breaks down during any period of hype or over bullishness. 
My theory is that this is because at the boring lows, Google trends are indeed a good indicator of how many people are genuinely interested in learning about bitcoin whereas during hype periods, the search index gets contaminated by speculators who are searching bitcoin only because they hear of rising price. 
So now that we are at a boring low, I see a search index of roughly 25 whereas in Oct 2016, it was around 9. So this shows a support for a price of around 700 times (25/9)^2 = 5400. 
Ofcourse this is assuming that search interest has stabilised and not still contaminated by speculators but I think that's a fair assumption especially after the very dull and low volume markets in October.

Pyramid schemes rely on investors being ignorant of the truth that their returns are being generated by the proceeds from a second line of investors who do not know that their returns come from a third line of investors. Ultimately there is no real benefit to anyone in the scheme other than the above way so the chain breaks at some point. 
With Bitcoin, the asset in question has an immediate benefit of giving you a defined proportion of a fixed supply that cannot be manipulated, a secure way of making trustless payments and an asset that cannot be confiscated. Knowing all these benefits, you also gain by virtue of adoption of this fixed supply by increasing number of people and thus causing appreciation of your holding. 
So unlike a pyramid scheme, there is an immediate gain of holding Bitcoin and also a justified reason to expect appreciation.

If your 'price follows interest' theory was strictly true then price should be rather stable and gently changing for most of bitcoins history right? After all, if interest is the causative factor and not the other way round then one must also accept that interest is not something that will keep shifting up and down heavily. So then why do we see huge peaks and valleys in the historical price trajectory? Please explain what causes interest to go up and down in this volatile manner?
The logical answer is that price and interest feed off each other but you seem to be adamant that price follows interest.

 Buying Bitcoin when it is down 80% from ATH is not analogous to buying Enron or Lehman stock on its way down. When stocks are plummeting, you are not getting the same for less. That's because the stock has value only because of the earning potential of the company behind it and a plummeting stock is usually the result of lower earnings, lower future potential of earnings, management incompetence and most importantly bankruptcy risk i.e the risk of the stock ceasing to exist. 
With bitcoin however, the thing you are getting for 0.2x of ATH now is exactly what you were getting at ATH. There is negligible risk of bitcoin ceasing to exist and there is no deterioration in the way bitcoin technologically works.
This is why the idea that a 80% fall will deter new buyers is flawed. Infact since they are getting same for less, they will be encouraged. I know because I was in the same boat as a new buyer in 2016. I will also add that people who buy in times like this are much more likely to HODL and stay comforted during volatility because they do so after some research about how bitcoin works. During a bull phase, most jump in because hey it is going up. They are the ones who fret and fret when momentum reverses and turn on to be what are called 'weak hands'. 
This transfer from weak hands to strong hands is why bitcoin has historically launched into a mega bull run after previous 80% fall events.

The issue is not about being convinced of a moon price target or a zero price target or some intermediate price target. It is great if you have some target in mind based on your research. 
The real problem is that many holders do not have any view at all. All the did was see a hype train and upward price momentum and jumped in without knowing anything at all about reasons for upside and risks of downside. They are the ones who are fretting and not knowing what to do now after the price momentum turned in the wrong direction.

Nobody forces away any hands. Individuals decide for themselves whether they wish to sell their coins. 
This has been true of wealth in general which finds its way to a few. In bitcoin though, to start with, the distribution is fair through competitive mining. But where the coins land up later is down to individual decisions. The design doesn't load the distribution in anyone's favour.

 This is exactly what you should do if you do not believe that Bitcoin is headed for heights way beyond 20k and probably to something like 250k. The problem is that many bought bitcoin without any understanding of what it is and why it has such price targets and therefore cannot comprehend why the price can ever recover from a 70% fall. These folks must either build up understanding or exit. No point riding the market blindly.

Fixed supply on the one blockchain that is objectively the most secure blockchain and has the best ecosystem of developers and has the most network advantage. This blockchain has a certain genesis block and consensus rules which distinguish it from others.  Yes it does have a name but why should it not? You are called by a certain name too. Someone else could have a similar sounding name as you but you are still you and retain a unique personality, right?
Similarly another blockchain can objectively be distinguished from the one that has until now been called Bitcoin. There is no confusion or lack of distinction between coins of different blockchains. And there cannot be more than one 'most secure cryptoasset'.

One of the many great things about the Internet is that your words are preserved. I see a lot of naysayers giving all kinds of reasons about why this bubble was so different from the last and why Bitcoin had one shot to engage the global audience and lost it, etc. All these comments will be very much accessible in 2021 just as the 2015 ones are now. 
 If Bitcoin touches 100k in 2021 (for which we believers have reasons that convince us), what new excuses will naysayers likely provide in 2021 given a written history available of their unsuccessful attempts? Would it make people even more unwilling to part with their coins than they were during the bull run to 19k? How will naysayers then show that 2021 was unlike any previous Bitcoin bubble?

So you think the value of gold comes from what you can build with it?
As for forks, forks are not Bitcoin so while you can create a fork, you cannot replicate Bitcoin. And if this was really a concern, how come Bitcoin dominance % has been on a rise since the mania of Dec 2017 when it became common knowledge that cryptos included Bitcoin and 1500+ other coins? 
Bitcoin is the most secure cryptoasset with the most network advantage due to the ecosystem of developers and businesses built around it. A fork or new coin has its task cut out to replicate these qualities AND still retain a fair level of decentralisation.
If a bigger network, more decentralised, more secure appears then yes, Bitcoin could get diluted. But why will that happen? Most Bitcoin forks happen, in the first place, due to egos and hidden objectives of a few so that takes away the possibility of what you are saying or at least makes the possibility very negligible. I am not here to tell you that Bitcoin is a zero risk vehicle but rather telling you my view on some of the supposed risks. I do have some alt coins though BTC is lion's share and M is lion's share of the remaining. The proportion I have in alt coins is based on my assessment of the probability that they may end up with a valuable network. I don't claim it is absolute zero for other coins but at the same time it is not that any new coin or fork start on the same footing as Bitcoin and immediately dilute its value. So calling crypto 'infinitely replicable' is just plain incorrect.
@_date: 2018-11-16 16:19:53

More reason for crypto to be held in wallets controlled by the owner. This is the whole reason for calling bitcoin 'uncensorable'. There are other benefits too but this one is given up if the owner doesn't control their own keys.

There is this conundrum always raised about people being bullish on bitcoin but not preferring to buy with bitcoin (when fiat is an alternative accepted by seller). I do not see any contradiction though. 
 Why do I choose to buy bitcoin? Because Bitcoin is the most secure deflationary cryptoasset. If I have to park my wealth in some crypto, I am going to do so in the crypto where I have an advantage. I see this only in bitcoin which is the most secure or in M* which is most private. Why should i choose any other crypto to park wealth?
On the other hand, to spend, I actually prefer to use the weakest currency which I have and which the other party is prepared to accept.
Now it is possible that due to these hard money qualities (But see my last para), eventually sellers may also insist on payment in bitcoin in which case then I will be happy to pay in bitcoin.
So you see there is no contradiction here in not preferring to pay in bitcoin now yet expecting it to nevertheless get adoption as a payment mechanism gradually and as an alternative asset class much sooner. 
Also realize that when a seller decides which currency to accept, part of their concern is what their suppliers want to be paid in and which currency taxes are denominated in. So there is good reason why adoption in transactions may take a long while. But while this happens, there is no similar impediment to adoption as an alternative asset in which to park wealth.

To take note: For Bitcoin to correct to the same % decrease as was seen in 2015, we will have to see a price of $3100. That would then correspond to the $1200 to $190 bear cycle of last time (after which bull cycle was 100x to $19k). Let's see how it goes this time. I don't claim to have any idea of the bottom. I am just proceeding with my daily DCA strategy where I have recently increased my daily fiat amount. I guess there is no point doing any more guessing or taking unnecessary risks. The reason I am a cool cucumber is because I always followed the rule 'Only invest what you can afford to lose'. I would remind that to anyone who is thinking of plunging in at these prices.

Better we see organic growth due to people learning about bitcoin themselves than due to scammy ads. Pumps due to incessant media articles and pressure to buy because others are buying are what result in unsustainable surges and later disappointment such as what you seem to have. But for the surge in nov and Dec, the bitcoin price trajectory appears a pretty reasonable extension of rest of 2017. I remember huge hype only in November and December. Rest of the year was tame in hype compared to these. Infact no hype occurred at all until mid May then again slipping until July and gradually building in Aug through Oct. Nov and Dec were indeed insane hype of the kind that does more harm than good as you are seeing.

I will tell you why I value Bitcoin. It is primarily because it represents a fixed supply of the most secure cryptoasset that exists. I find it very unlikely that any other crypto asset can substitute bitcoin for this use case. Govt issued crypto can be used widespread for payments but will never have the fixed supply feature. So you see, I am less hung up on the cost and speed issue and more attracted to the fixed supply and most secure and trustless feature. 
Now this may either convince you or not but to each his own.

I think what they are hoping to achieve by blacklisting an addresses is to prevent the coins that already exist at that address from being of any use. If you can't spend it or exchange it for fiat because merchants and exchanges are prohibited from accepting BTC from those addresses then those coins are essentially worthless. 
Yes people can create new addresses but when you transfer coins from the blacklisted address to the new address, this can be seen on the blockchain and so now the tainted coins are still identifiable.

Being a decentralised censorship resistant and limited quantity asset is a usecase by itself so nothing wrong in people buying it hoping for a price rise due to more people buying that asset after understanding the usecase. This is the reason why it got from $1 to 32, then 3 to 250, then 65 to 1200 and then 190 to 19000. Why do you think this will change and not take it from 5k (?) to ???  .

That's BS. Any close look at the Google trends data makes it very obvious that big spikes in price are what cause big spikes in interest. You will go nowhere if you try to time the market bottom using the interest indicator. 
Take a look at interest indicator in Oct 2013. Did you see any pattern there that told you a huge upswing from $70 to $1200 was coming? But it did come and then ofcourse the trends indicator too shot up to highs.

Rising price in December sure corresponded with rising search index but not in any predictable proportion. Search index on many days of December reached absurd high levels like 200+ and even just under 600 near 8th Dec. But the price did not increase in any proportion as this would suggest. 
Click the link I posted above. It shows gtrends data but it expresses the daily gtrend figure as a multiple of what it was on 1/1/2012.
As for why square, it probably has to do with Metcalfe's law. As more people join a network, the value rises not only in the proportion of increased people but also because each person tends to put in more money due to gaining increased confidence in the value of the network.

Ok so we can see from what you wrote that you just made a bet but without gaining any understanding of why the upsides and why the downsides that could be involved. That is not the correct way of making investments as you are now finding out. 
All of have now is hope that maybe the price might recover and hope without reason is what is makiing you angry and frustrated. I too am down from my portfolio peak by more than 75% but not at all frustrated because I have my reasons for expecting recovery and many multiples higher and I am convinced all those reasons still remain valid.
Hopefully this is an investing lesson for you in future.

Why do you think forks dilute Bitcoin? Are the forks ever comparable to Bitcoin in security or in their decentralised nature or in their ecosystem? Can anyone be confused and mistake a fork coin for Bitcoin? With fake jewellery, it is a worry that imitations could pass of as real but with crypto that is not a worry. So what is the concern about being able to fork?

Please understand there are two distinct usecases: one concerning store of value and the other concerning transactions. They are NOT the same. And success in one does not imply success in the other. Nor does failure in one imply failure in the other.
There are some valid arguments to think that a single asset may struggle to achieve dominance in both. 
This is the number one confusion most in crypto do not immediately get.

I knew that bitcoin had lost 85% value from ATH and that actually encouraged me to buy bitcoin in 2016 after reading about it (Because you know I like to get more for less and not the other way round). Why will others be different?

Fine. But over a period of time the buy and HODL group only increases in number and is only poised to grow since it is still a very small proportion of what it can be. That's why despite these valleys, the price is poised to go upwards over the longer horizon, notwithstanding the presence of traders.
You need to reflect on why bitcoin firstly rose from nothing to where it is now. There might always have been traders but the rise is due to the expansion of the buy and HODL gang. Why will that trend stop now?

What do you not understand about institutional custody solutions? The situation is simple. Hedge funds and institutional investors cannot simply use a trezor to hold their crypto. They would be sued to oblivion if funds were somehow lost. They are therefore unable to even offer crypto holding funds for this very reason. With the institutional custody solutions in place, this major impediment goes away. What part of this is unreasonable hype?

What hype juice? At that point less than 0.01% might have bought crypto, now might be 0.5% or at best 1%. So what indicates no juice? On the other hand, much more awareness of bitcoin by the 99.5% who have been unaffected by all this fall because they never bought. By what stretch then is there 'no juice '?

I agree I am a bad timer. In the next bull run, I will use some of the lessons and indicators of over- exuberance that I observed in this cycle and perhaps use it to my advantage. But this is a matter entirely different to the topic of whether it is worth buying bitcoin now. This is clearly a phase of irrational panic - a situation quite analogous but  opposite to what you are pointing I should have noted during the peak.
I don't consider myself a genius for buying in 2016 nor stupid for not selling in Dec 2017. But I will try next time to perhaps time my sale at over exuberance period of next bull run at the risk of looking stupid then.
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:30:50
So even Mr Neveragain admits 100K likely in 5 or 6 years. 18x in that time horizon. See if you know any other investment asset that can boast of such a prediction from its naysayers :-)
And to be honest, that is the kind of timeframe one should have in mind for crypto. You come in for short term gains, be ready to probably get burned. If you can stick out 5 to 7 years, then the risks are far far lower. I have no beef against this view.
However I disagree that the Dec 2017 bubble was any different from the previous bitcoin bubbles we have seen. It is just the same pattern that should not surprise anyone who cared to study the previous price action patterns and the reasons thereof. There are just more number of Joes involved than the previous bubbles but notably this number is still a very minute fraction of the number of Joes who can get involved in future.
Read and re-read this to understand this seemingly disastrous price action:
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:52:08
I don't know which public you have spoken to but in my country (a major western one), I have yet to come across any one in my workplace or friend circle who bought any bitcoin despite the hype. And I work in financial industry and interact quite a bit with technology folks. I think people in this forum somehow carry the mood outside and think everyone is just as familiar with and involved with bitcoin. People, this forum is hardly representative in any way of people in regular lives. Not the teeniest bit.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:31:26
Posting this again as it is now more pertinent:
Buying Bitcoin when it is down 80% from ATH is not analogous to buying Enron or Lehman stock on its way down. When stocks are plummeting, you are not getting the same for less. That's because the stock has value only because of the earning potential of the company behind it and a plummeting stock is usually the result of lower earnings, lower future potential of earnings, management incompetence and most importantly bankruptcy risk i.e the risk of the stock ceasing to exist.
With bitcoin however, the thing you are getting for 0.2x of ATH now is exactly what you were getting at ATH. There is negligible risk of bitcoin ceasing to exist and there is no deterioration in the way bitcoin technologically works.
This is why the idea that a 80% fall will deter new buyers is flawed. Infact since they are getting same for less, they will be encouraged. I know because I was in the same boat as a new buyer in 2016. I will also add that people who buy in times like this are much more likely to HODL and stay comforted during volatility because they do so after some research about how bitcoin works. During a bull phase, most jump in because hey it is going up. They are the ones who fret and fret when momentum reverses and turn on to be what are called 'weak hands'.
This transfer from weak hands to strong hands is why bitcoin has historically launched into a mega bull run after previous 80% fall events.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:12:06
The Fedcoin will ofcourse have value just like the dollar today has value. It will just be a replacement for dollar. But the comparison between bitcoin and the Fedcoin will be exactly like the comparison between dollar and bitcoin. Just being a crypto and powered by a blockchain makes no difference to this comparison. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:29:56
All such predictions need to be accompanied with an explanation of why a recovery happened in 2015 from 85% below ATH.
Not just bitcoin, every coin that has been around for a while has seen 90% corrections in the past. Be it litecoin or be it Monero and have all recovered. It has been the nature of crypto price movements and adoption. So why are you so convinced this fractal won't repeat? Because humans have changed?
@_date: 2018-11-18 18:48:48
Well you will hold and probably sell when it reaches your buy price or a little higher. But eventually when it does moon, as many of us are convinced it eventually will, will you again be upset and hate bitcoin or yourself? Moral of the story: Do your own research to find out what price you should buy at and exit at and don't let this just be determined by the price trajectory that the market takes the asset through.
For example: If you don't think bitcoin is even worth 5k, why aren't you exiting now instead of waiting for the market to do something?
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:53:50

I live in a major western country and have never met anyone yet in my work circles who bought crypto. Sure they have heard of bitcoin by now and some were curious earlier this year.

Seems less then 1%, probably much lower, from my experience.
@_date: 2018-11-11 10:30:04
Agreed (that there is no hard floor like stocks but not that Bitcoin 'will go straight to zero cents '). Anyone who invests in bitcoin should know that this asset is not akin to stocks in any manner. The value proposition is entirely different and so are the risks involved. You are right that there is no floor like a dividend generating stock might but equally Bitcoin does not have the bankruptcy risk that a stock has. It is really chalk and cheese. You cannot really compare anything meaningfully between stock and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:36:00
Well you seem to agree that those shitcoins lack any decentralisation. No wonder that either since most forks of bitcoin are due to small interested parties who cheer lead some egoistic individuals. If this is the genesis of these forks, then it is actually logical that the mining and decision making for these coins is concentrated among few parties too and thus lack any semblance of decentralisation. 
Now since blockchain cryptography ensures that these coins can't just be mistaken for real Bitcoin, then where does the concern of dilution come from? For a while, there were concerns that the similar names were what was confusing. But now with the forks fighting amongst themselves and becoming abc and SV, even that falls away as the concern. 
I really want to know what you are thinking here.

This one. 
Interest from general public is the bedrock of why Bitcoin has a price at all. At boring bottoms, this search interest (which becomes largely composed of people genuinely interested in bitcoin) becomes a good indicator of the fundamental driver of the price. And the empirical data provided in the post fits this theory quite well. 
And if you don't like the idea of using Google searches as indicator, here is another way I have described

It just needs to be accepted as a form of wealth which bitcoin's secure uninflatable nature alone is good enough to ensure. As a consequence, it may be that it also gets accepted widely in transactions but this is not guaranteed. Acceptance in transactions has many other criteria to it. Easiest way to see this is why do shops in various countries prefer to accept their home currency and not necessarily some of the relatively harder major currencies like usd, eur, GBP? Merchants need to see what their taxes are due in, what their suppliers want to be paid in, etc and not just what is the hardest currency. 
Transactions and store of wealth are really two independent use cases.

It's not 4300 that is heartening by itself. After all we were 6k+ not two weeks back. It is that we saw a steep crash and then a steep rebound in volumes that left even most days of Dec and Jan behind.

If bigger network, more decentralised, more secure then yes. But why will that happen? Most Bitcoin forks happen, in the first place, due to egos and hidden objectives of a few so that takes away the possibility of what you are saying or at least makes the possibility very negligible. I am not here to tell you that Bitcoin is a zero risk vehicle but rather telling you my view on some of the supposed risks. I do have some alt coins though BTC is lion's share and M is lion's share of the remaining. The proportion I have in alt coins is based on my assessment of the probability that they may end up with a valuable network. I don't claim it is absolute zero for other coins but at the same time it is not that any new coin or fork starts on an equal footing and immediately dilutes Bitcoin.

Use of XRP in the way that these companies do for money transfer will not necessarily contribute to rise in price of XRP. 'Use' in the general sense that most people think of the word is not a sufficient condition for a crypto to rise in price. For price rise you need 'Use' of a certain type. To be more clear one that requires HODLing the coin, not just buying and selling it as is the case with money transfer. I only see Bitcoin and Monero being the coins which have a strong 'HODL' usecase by virtue of best in class of security and privacy respectively.

Both. Primarily an asset but which can also easily be used as currency when the seller insists on being paid with Bitcoin or when the use case is a high value or cross border payment scenario where finality of payment, speed of payment and cutting out financial intermediaries may be desirable to the transacting parties.

I will agree that short term trades where you hope to get in and out quickly with profit and try to apply some TA based logic to anticipate short term swings are indeed a type of gambling.

All money by definition is make-believe. But you can choose which ones you want to believe in. The answer can be different depending on the use case you focus on. Daily transactions and knowing what it will be worth tomorrow, probably good to believe in fiat. Longer term store of value (say about 2/3 years or more) I believe in bitcoin. Actually at the end period of a deflated bubble such as now, I believe in bitcoin as a store of value even for shorter time frames than that. Hence I am accumulating now and will continue for a while. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:55:55
I will tell you why I value Bitcoin. It is primarily because it represents a fixed supply of the most secure cryptoasset that exists. I find it very unlikely that any other crypto asset can substitute bitcoin for this use case. Govt issued crypto can be used widespread for payments but will never have the fixed supply feature. So you see, I am less hung up on the cost and speed issue and more attracted to the fixed supply and most secure and trustless feature.
Now this may either convince you or not but to each his own.

@_date: 2018-11-17 07:02:05
You either get this or you don't. There can only be one 'most secure cryptoasset' and unlike any other asset in the world, this one is assured to NEVER increase in supply. Google trends, sentiment etc may keep ebbing or rising but this fact does not change. 
If this realisation was not part of the reason why you put money into Bitcoin, please go back to the drawing board and maybe consider exiting. 
10 years of history show that this impacts the price dynamic in a fairly consistent cyclic manner and still many refuse to comprehend the staring reason behind it. As I said, some just get it and others don't. Those who don't, laugh for a few years while those who do, end up with the last and much longer laugh. There is no reason for this to discontinue.

When Bitcoin gains say a multiple of 10, the mechanism by which this happens is not that you will need to find one person paying you 10 times the amount. If this were the case, Bitcoin would be like an indivisible Mona Lisa for which you need the entire appreciated amount to come from one buyer. But Bitcoin is infinitely divisible so the sustainable gains come due to adoption by growing number of people buying a smaller and smaller proportion of the supply for the same fiat amount. So this doesn't require you to be in search of people with higher and higher amounts of fiat in their pockets. 
And you talk of dividend being the benefit of a stock. Here it is a different benefit - that of being an unconfiscateable asset that can be transferred trustlessly and whose total supply won't change. Why insist that fiat is worth exchanging only for one type of benefit?

Heard and getting burnt are two very different things. As soon as something like 200 day MA price falls below the bitcoin price, sentiment starts shifting as the most recent buyers couldn't care less about the movement before they bought. Old holders too are fine to have the price trending up. There is no longer reason for anyone to be upset and new buyers get attracted again not bothering what happened to those who bought at 19k. This gentle trend continues until naysayers suddenly realise bitcoin is actually not that much below ATH. And a new cycle begins. Story of 2012 and 2015 and story of future.

Nope. You are not taking into account that Bitcoin is unique for its immutability, fixed supply, infinite divisibility, no storage costs, ability to be communicated over a network and importantly high degree of security that too without the need to trust any entity. None of these apply to toilet paper. So it is not just a question of believing in anything. The object to believe in must have certain qualities that enable it to be a form of wealth and it is here that Bitcoin shines.

It did predict a drop to 3k levels if I had done this analysis in October (notice in my data that I used October search results) but I admit we are in a learning period where I improvised on the model after the fact. Now this will be useful going forward. Both methods above would have clearly signalled over valuation in the entire period from may 2017 until now. As I said, there had not been sufficient history of bitcoin to know which models work but now we gain more confidence in them for future use.
The rise in search results post October is irrelevant as that was a volatile and non boring period. But if you used the second method then either way (Oct or nov data), the conclusion would have been that 3k was on the cards.

Ha...I got into bitcoin in 2016 and it mattered little to me that bitcoin had crashed 85% in 2014 and 2015. On the contrary, after I read up a lot about bitcoin and then looked up the price history, I was encouraged even more that I was buying at a price that was at a very appealing discount from the then ATH.
The day the price moves up over the 6 month moving average, you will notice that new buyers on this forum couldn't care less what the previous history was. For them, all that will matter is that they are sitting on profits.

Are you on drugs? Bitcoin price touched 3k on Sep 16th 2017 and remained under 4k till about 25th Sep. At the beginning of 2017, price was 1k and at the beginning of 2016, it was $400. What are you on about?

Gtrend graph assigns the index 1 to the number of times the word 'Bitcoin' was searched on 1/1/2012. Now for all other dates, they scale down the number as a multiple of searches on 1/1/2012. So today the index of around 25 means that 'Bitcoin ' is searched 25 times more often than on 1/1/2012.
Now my observation is regarding periods of boring bottoms. Here I find that the price at these bottoms has been proportional to the square of the gtrend index. And I have given you the reason why being proportional to the square makes sense. 
Look for the price prevailing in mid 2012, mid 2013, mid 2015 and now. It ties up very closely to this proportion. 
And ofcourse all this data was taken from Google trends.

At this point, I will strongly discourage anyone who has a timeframe shorter than 3 years, from venturing to put money into Bitcoin. This is not a get rich quick scheme. You need to understand the rationale behind the rise many expect and also the risks involved including the fact that right now the crypto market is immature and much like a soap opera. Now is a good time for those who have done their research and willing to stomach potential downside for the next 2 or 3 years. Ofcourse it could happen we are already at a bottom but do not count on this being a certainty.
Come to think of it, this advice would have been apt at any point in the past for bitcoin including last December. But at that point, too many jumped in with no regard to the risks and the result is so many whiners today.

At the outset let me say that I support action against criminals .
But that said, I cannot understand the practicalities of the OFAC blacklisting of certain Bitcoin addresses. From what I have read, the expectation is that US citizens should not be accepting bitcoin from those addresses. But then those bitcoins can easily be transferred to other addresses and since mining is open and competitive, those transactions will get confirmed. So now, how will anyone who accepts bitcoin know for sure that they aren't actually receiving bitcoin that originated from those addresses?
Will the authorities also stipulate that miners should exclude transactions from those addresses? And then there will need to be a rule that miners should not build on top of a block that has confirmed a transaction from those addresses. But how will all this be enforced unless a forked bitcoin is created that incorporates this blacklisting as a consensus rule?
If this seems to be the way things go, only Monero with its fungibility can plausibly survive. But I would like to hear how else events can play out that can still make Bitcoin viable despite the above conundrum. I hold both Bitcoin (57%) and Monero (22%) in my portfolio.

Let's leave it at that. We will talk in 2021 or thereabouts. I am conscious that the arguments around Bitcoin are a head wrapper for both sides.

@_date: 2019-01-02 00:04:37
I am not sure whether 1) is objectively a point in favour. I like the fact that Bitcoin is not tangible and thus has no storage costs or security concerns of the same nature such as what storing gold entails (yes there are other kind of security concerns with bitcoin storage but I prefer dealing with those than guarding a safe). 
2) Blockchain aims to replicate the same kind of persistence, scarcity and immutability. Now I wouldn't go too the same planetary time frames you have mentioned but perhaps good enough. 
3) and 5) don't really address why gold has value. You are essentially giving examples of where it was considered valued.
4) is a matter of debate because it is widely believed that while there are industrial and other uses of gold, those alone fail to explain more than about 10% of its market value.

Ok so that exposure made people aware of Bitcoin. So now what? Why do we need hype again? People can now calm down, take their time to understand what they had heard of, let themselves mull over thoughts and then enter the market when comfortable. Slowly but surely, the price inches back up because the number of bitcoins is fixed. No more insane hype needed nor desired. The hype has done its work of spreading awareness of the existence of a thing called Bitcoin.

You keep saying that. Did you check out Google trends data for 2015? It was flatline from Jan 2015 till about Sep 2016. Yet price tripled gradually over this period. And then fomo made the trends indicator catch up.

Because Bitcoin is the most secure crypto. If I have to park my wealth in some crypto, I am going to do so in the crypto where I have an advantage. I see this only in bitcoin which is the most secure or in M* which is most private. Why should i choose any other crypto to park wealth?
On the other hand, to spend, I actually prefer to use the weakest currency which I have and which the other party is prepared to accept.
Now it is possible that due to these hard money qualities (But see my last para), eventually sellers may also insist on payment in bitcoin in which case then I will be happy to pay in bitcoin. 
So you see there is no contradiction here in not preferring to pay in bitcoin now yet expecting it to nevertheless get adoption as a payment mechanism  gradually.
Also realize that when a seller decides which currency to accept, part of their concern is what their suppliers want to be paid in and which currency taxes are denominated in. So there is good reason why adoption in transactions may take a long while. But while this happens, there is no similar impediment to adoption as an alternative asset in which to park wealth.

What do you mean? Folks who sold off in the 300/400 range in Dec 2014 must have been very smug and thinking of themselves as SMART for the whole of 2015 when price settled in 200s and occasionally even below. Most of these folks also would not have entered back even in Dec 2015 when price recovered back to 300 and then 400. These folks probably shut themselves out of the next bull run all the while convinced they were the SMART ones or ended by sheepishly entering at levels 5x of where they once sold off. 
Those selling off now are in all likelihood repeating this same picture in a magnified fractal.
In saying all this, I don't deny the possibility of market taking a step lower before recovering.

You are forgetting that 99.5% of the populace has not made any losses since they never touched crypto. For them all that happens is that something which was expensive is now cheap. How is this something that makes them less likely to invest?
This effect was exactly what convinced me to buy bitcoin in 2016 after knowing that it had seen an 85% crash in 2014/15. 
Things would be different if some massive scam had been perpetrated such as bitcoin supply being actually a lot more than the 17 million known to be in circulation but there has been no such scam. This is pure market movement and this won't turn away new buyers but rather bring them in.

I don't buy into the first argument either.

Yes bitcoins value is dependent on how many buy it in future but how is this a problem? It is like saying a stocks value is dependent on profits generated in future. 
In both cases, as long as one has the right reasons to believe the forecasts for the future, the valuation today has a basis. 
Now you may disagree on how many will buy in future and that's fine. But don't say that it is a flaw in bitcoin that it's value is linked to how many will buy in future.

One model uses Google searches because searches show that people are interested in bitcoin - hence a proxy for how many people want to buy bitcoin. 
The other model uses data from the blockchain on how widespread the distribution of bitcoin is. More widespread means more adopted. 
Both provided a similar conclusion. 
Now until we have anything more reliable than this - and I cannot imagine where you can expect any more reliable proxies of real interest in Bitcoin, I do trust my model.
Your statement is kind of right but that's what models are. They are not crystal balls but best efforts at predicting what might happen.

Note though that this is the first rise in quite some time to happen on very heavy volumes. And it was immediately preceded by a crash on very heavy volumes.

 You think BTC is too radical for govts?  I hope you have researched and seen other coins like Monero which are far more radical in what they could mean for govts. I own both Monero and BTC because when you look at these together, you almost get the feeling bitcoin will be the more acceptable and friendly crypto for govts. Nevertheless I see Monero also potentially finding its way to niche use cases so I have a stack of that too. But just wanted to point out how BTC is probably one of the less threatening to govts by way of its transparent blockchain.

Gov't fiat exists and govt crypto can come. But there will always be space for some decentralised currency that govts cannot control. This will be regardless of whether govts like it or not. That was the whole point of a distributed ledger technology like blockchain that cannot just be shut down. Not all govts are going to cooperate to shut down a crypto and therein lies the strength. You seem to over estimate the possibility of just shutting down something as resilient as Bitcoin.

20 years to a million would still mean a compounded annual growth rate of 32% here on. Not something you can count on for most other investments.

Given human nature to desire gains, I just cannot visualise Bitcoin just grinding down without finding a level where greed stabilizes it and kicks off new fomo. This is not a defect.

Wrong. The desired growth path is not by one person buying your stash for higher but by many more people adopting bitcoin and buying your whole stash together - each still putting in only a reasonable amount of fiat. So the bulls base their growth not on bitcoin changing hands among same number of people at ever higher prices but rather on growth due to higher number of people sharing the same fixed supply of Bitcoin.
And there is nothing wrong or Ponzi like in this model. You expect more people to learn about and adopt what you as an early adopter learnt about. Nobody is getting fooled here and there is no zero sum game either. Everyone wins either by making money in fiat or by ending up with a stable bitcoin that is widely adopted.

If the search index sustains at 25, then I would say this should sustain support for $3500 to $5000. So the price now seems to be in a territory which doesn't look much frothy. Momentum can ofcourse take things down but there appears to be a level of safety at current prices judging by the gtrend index. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 10:34:03
A lot of the crowd (and most of it is from those who recently sold at a loss) here seems to think no one will now buy Bitcoin because it has fallen 83%.
What they really mean is that I hope new investors do not now buy Bitcoin and thereby make me look like a fool to have bought at 5 times as much and then sold at a loss. 
I hate to break it to you but that's not how the world runs. People do not make investment decisions in solidarity with your losses. They will look and assess for themselves whether they think Bitcoin is worth buying at current prices. It is a different debate on whether the current prices are worth buying at or not but I can tell you that one thing which is definitely an attracting rather than putting off for for new buyers is the 83% fall.
Hint: It was for me in 2016.

Nice example and a perspective for folks who think an 80% crash is the reason why people will no longer buy Bitcoin. 
Just like you, I bought bitcoin in 2016 and the main reason was that I too got convinced after reading a lot about it, that this thing is here to stay. However, the fact that it was still 60% below ATH acted like an icing on the cake and further dispelled any doubts that I was blowing my money. 
I have no doubt there are many who researched and convinced themselves about bitcoin last year but were hesitant to jump in because of the frenzy. Now when things have calmed down and prices are 80% down, these are the strong hands who accumulate and lay the foundation for the next bull run.

How is it that there is hardly any rise in number of transactions on the blockchain during this dip? One might think people would be in a stampede to sell.  But the transaction numbers aren't showing that. So it must then be that price decrease is only due to the bitcoin sitting on exchange wallets.
Remember on this day last year when bitcoin hit the headlines, the network got clogged with too many transactions. Why not now when selling is taking place?

I do believe in hard money and prefer one monetary store of value. But I also see the current reality that Bitcoin is not fully fungible or private. Therefore given that these two qualities are quite essential for a monetary system, I can either hope that Bitcoin eventually implements these or I can hedge by also owning another coin like Monero which at the moment is streets ahead of all coins as far as privacy and fungibility is concerned. This way I am covered in either scenario by holding both Bitcoin and Monero. You can have belief in hard money but why should that translate to blind belief in Bitcoin inevitably enhancing itself in areas where it is currently deficient? If it does then great but why should you not hedge by backing another coin that does better in the areas where Bitcoin is currently deficient?

What is the thinking behind the thought of many that prices will recover but after a flash crash to an absurdly low level?

Is that how the logic goes?
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:23:59
What changed due to this bear market is redistribution of coins from some large holders who sold into the hands of many informed small holders at lower levels. Remember the buyers at lower levels are the ones who are well researched and have conviction unlike most who bought one the way up simply because price was going up. 
So a new layer of hodlers has been cemented that will trigger the next bull run. All this is aside from the fact that technologically and ecosystem wise, things are far better than last year.

You aren't getting my point. For sure speculators can use futures or cfds or whatever to play their game. But speculation alone is not what we mean by adoption of Bitcoin. The real purpose of Bitcoin is to make payments, transfer value and store in your control. All these you can't do with futures. So the scarcity remains.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:37:18
No. Good investors will not have the word 'only' in the above sentence. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:06:35
You think the normal investor is going to prefer entering a derivative contract at CME instead of holding coins in their wallet? Plus cash settled futures are not even a proper replication of the spot market. Wait for the ICE physically settled futures. They will be the ones to have a proper linkage to the spot market. 
If the futures contract reduces speculation then that is great. But by bitcoin adoption, I mean people holding bitcoin for the actual utility it provides I.e a way to hold value outside centralised entities and being able to make payments or transfer value without needing third parties. Futures may just replicate the speculation aspect but by no means the real utility. So on that count, scarcity for the real non speculative use case remains.

Scarcity is scarcity and being achieved outside of natural reasons is no disadvantage. 
Utility is there and you just need to think a little too realise it. It allows trustless communication of value securely in an infinitely divisible manner. There is no other way period to achieve this today in an equally secure manner. Note this utility is in addition to the scarcity so it is the combination of the two that makes Bitcoin an asset worth investing in. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:37:43
It allows trustless wealth storage and trustless wealth transfer and it does this better than it did years ago thanks to being a more secure coin now due to sustained higher hash rate. What do you mean by saying it has no use case? Can you achieve this by any other means? It doesn't follow that one has to need this use case for purchasing daily groceries or cups of coffee.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:20:23
To be precise though, it stayed sideways for quite a while until Aug before a breakout. People right now think it's headed down so they will need to see the price not going down for a while before any fomo can take place. So I think the recovery from bottom might be a gradual one with a fast take off after a while. I might be completely wrong. Let's see.

Mantra for staying sane in crypto: Only invest what you can afford to potentially lose and stay invested for a longer term of least few years where you don't need access to your funds. 
Follow this and you can actually enjoy days like these. Don't follow this and you will shit your pants during a bear market and also shit your pants during a bull market. 
Yes, it is possible to always find that sweet balance where your investment is meaningful enough to stay actively interested in the market yet still sticking to the above rule. That sweet spot is what you need to find for yourself.

It is kind of the opposite to last year when people who otherwise never talked crypto started enquiring about how to buy crypto. That was the top. Now if you are seeing people make snarky comments like that then maybe it is a sign of the bottom. 
It is actually intuitive when you think of it. When there is too much optimism, the price probably already reflects the max the market can support. On the other hand, when everyone seems very negative, the price probably already has been bashed down to the minimum level.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:36:35
I guess a key reason is that the index fund included other shitcoins with weightage as per their market cap. And their marketcaps are arguably higher than what they deserve. So even if an institution is interested in crypto they would want to stay away from such a market weighted index fund.

True. I got in when the recovery from last bubble burst was just about starting. Yes, I probably should have sensed a bubble forming at 15k thereabouts. So my mistake there. But I won't make another mistake by not taking advantage of the burst bubble now. If, as I expect, we reach new highs in a few years, I would be better off than if this bubble had not happened as I wouldn't have had extra time to accumulate. And accumulation is what I am doing now.

Yes it can't go on for ever. But ask yourself this: isn't it the case that about 5 to 10x more people know about bitcoin now than in Jan 2015? As for fear factor, that should have been worse in 2015 due to gox scam. Also, the market of people who worldwide bought  crypto is about 1% or less so the market itself certainly has room to grow that multiple for now.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:42:11
 And that is one of the reasons those prices will never reach. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:13:58
On the contrary, Bitcoin is remarkably unique but it takes some thinking to realise that. It is open source and you can copy it and create bitcoin2 but by no means does Bitcoin2 become indistinguishable from  Bitcoin. Nor does it capture miner hashrate and hence it does not attain the same security level as Bitcoin. So the title of 'most secure decentralised crypto ' is one that is nearly impossible to steal from Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:18:49
Why are you not selling then? You trust your one year prognosis, right?
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:30:10
I guess this debate can only settle in a few years time. You realise decentralised exchanges are coming? Once that happens, not issues of the sort you mention will happen because coins will truly never be in a centralised entities control. Today you can store coins in your own wallet but still have some dependency on centralised exchanges. That will go away with decentralised exchanges but all that is a few years away. You can take a look at how Bisq works today.
I don't disagree there is hype today but you too are ignoring the changes that are likely to come in just a few years. As they say, impact of new technology is often overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term.

Actually that's one part of it. The other part which most implicitly do and will care about is the fact that the supply will never change. This may seem to you like an irrelevant matter in the absence of a 'real' use case but it is unprecedented in the history of the world to have an asset so easily transferable but one whose supply is rigidly fixed. To know that you own x% of an assets supply and that you will always retain x% is a fact that should be treated as a usecase by itself. If you don't realise it now, you will in future even if you continue looking for another 'real' use case.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:36:00
Not much. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 00:51:55

Gambling doesn't repeatedly produce winning streaks over the years. Despite the rather unpredictably short term behaviour of bitcoin, it has been remarkably predictable in its pattern over time.  And there is good reason behind it:
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:37:37
All of what you are saying is the case with normal sanctions too. The govt just announces sanctions and most people including businesses end up complying. True that because banks are necessary to transact in fiat, it becomes much more difficult to transact with sanctioned entities because you will not be able to do so via the banking system. But with crypto, enforcement of such sanctions is a lot more difficult. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:34:10
 If you see old bitcoin threads from years back, one of the most striking thing you will notice is that typical buyers had 100s of btc in 2015, 500 of btc in 2013 and 1000s in 2011 and 2012. Now such whales are very far and few. Why? Because the massive price cycles have caused redistribution of coins among a wider swath of people through a combination of profit booking and panic selling. 
It is the more thinly spread out BTC that enables a much higher price to be easily sustained now than say in 2015 or 2012. There is every reason for the same trend of distribution thinning out to continue and thus support higher prices in future. 
This is also the reason why you do not have to find one person to buy your stash at higher price in future - something that many call Greater Fool theory. That only applies to indivisible objects. The mechanism that supports higher BTC price is entirely different and is supported by the money like infinitely divisible feature. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:33:17
But when it reaches its old high again and exceeds it, what will people look back on 2018 and think? I mean what do you think today about 2014 and the fact that Bitcoin recovered from not only that price decline but also a genuine scam like Mt Gox? You see, we are still 17x the bottom of that cycle and 3x the top. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:24:06
It is clear that the reason for the cycles is hoarding of coins by hodlers who bought during last trough coupled with fomo from new buyers. Ultimately, at a peak many multiples of the trough, many hodlers dump their stash due to size of profits they are sitting on (pure prudent risk management). That triggers the opposite effect of price decrease reinforced by panic sells. Ultimately this cycle ends when panic triggers even hodlers who had not yet sold to dump out of fear of losing their still decent profits. This finally gets bitcoin into a more distributed state at a price low enough to tempt new hodlers. And the cycle then starts all over again.
If you think of it, it is unreasonable to think that the price of an asset like bitcoin can take any other trajectory other than the one described above. For example, tell me which of the above effects has a valid chance of not happening at all and thus to break the cycle of peaks and troughs? Do you think it is at all possible for price to keep on rising smoothly and if so, how can this square up with the effects I described above?
All that said, it is still not easy at all to predict what the peak and trough points will be in a cycle.
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:26:28
Not appropriate since cards don't reassemble themselves repeatedly like bitcoin historically has.

How on earth is it even remotely possible that a coin launched by a centralised private firm displaces a coin which gained value in the first place due to being scarce (fixed supply) and most importantly immutable and decentralised? Without the latter qualities, it is ludicrous to think that some FB coin or Gcoin or Amazoncoin has any chance to displace bitcoin. Plus it is impossible for a coin launched by these entities to have these qualities. 
The situation is simply not analogous to Facebook replacing myspace or similar other cases. Those were services being replaced by other services. Bitcoin is not just a service. It has value due to other unique qualities and not just for being a service.
Now you tell me how a decentralised immutable new coin springs into existence and displaces Bitcoin? Who develops this new protocol (without being a fork of current bitcoin)? And how are these new coins issued to the public (if not a fork of Bitcoin). Remember that if this is a fork of Bitcoin then bitcoin remains valuable.
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:12:59
 Facebook and Google are companies run by their respective Managements and depend on employees working. They cannot run on autopilot based on human behaviour. 
Bitcoin on the other hand needs no employees or centralised management to run. There is no support centre not needs employees to run. Yes, there are dev teams in the ecosystem who are working on improving Bitcoin but left to itself, Bitcoin would work as it does now without depending on any central entity. Miners will mine not out of altruistic intentions but out of pure incentives. Users will HODL and use again out of their self interest. 
Got it?
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:28:33
I think once an address on the blacklist sends coins to another address, then only these coins on the other address will be considered tainted. Other coins that already existed at the new address will not be considered tainted. This sort of taint designation is possible because inputs to an address are all clearly segregated. 
This does still mean problems for the receiving address because they will not immediately know which of the coins at their address are tainted without employing some analysis. Further most wallets do not easily allow choosing selected inputs when sending a btc amount. So it will be trouble for the receiving address to identify tainted coins and to prevent them from being sent out in their next transaction.
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:11:54
Let's revisit this statement in a few years. What you forget is that recovery isn't about the same people buying again. It is about new people buying for whom all that is important is that they are seeing a price far cheaper than what they saw last year. This also is how I bought in 2016. It wasn't a secret for me that Bitcoin had crashed 83% in 2014 and 2015.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:53:57

@_date: 2018-12-07 23:53:57
I am actually surprised that there is hardly any rise in on chain transactions during this entire dip. This means the price action is entirely caused due to traders shifting coins on exchange as opposed to normal people who store their coins in a wallet panicking and sending to exchange. No significant uptick in sat/byte transaction fees either.
@_date: 2018-12-04 18:57:44
All of what I said is over and above the fact that Bitcoin has useful qualities (It is the most secure trustless way of storing and transferring wealth).

Another nugget of ignorance. Do you know how mining secures bitcoin? Do you know what a 51% attack is? When you read and learn about this, you will understand that Bitcoin has a huge advantage over any other crypto and is by far the 'most secure crypto'.

Good strategy and everyone is welcome to try it now and in future. If you manage to pinpoint the peak and bottom, all power to you. 
Infact with the known history, if everyone tried to benefit from this knowledge of the pattern, maybe we might actually see a less volatile Bitcoin as any huge tendency to rise will be countered by people trying to sell because they think they have timed a top. Similar opposite tendency during a bear phase.
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:37:57

I always think of it as an asset with the capability to act as currency under conditions where the parties involved deem it beneficial to do so. So if the owners want to hoard bitcoin, they can do so and this will have a positive effect on its price. The market price by definition is one which has tempted hoarders to not continue hoarding.

Right now a lot of people are licking their lips thinking they can buy a whole bunch of coins at a lower price when last year it took 19k to get one.

So at some point when people jump in to execute their desired strategy of getting a big bunch of coins, they cannot all succeed because there just aren't that many coins. What happens then?

Buy high is not by itself bad because one only realises on hindsight what was high.

I like and own both Bitcoin and xmr. I think both have their pros and cons and are excellent hedges for each other:
1. Private vs transparent blockchain
2. Gentle perpetual but reducing inflation vs fixed supply
3. Adaptive blocksize vs fixed max blocksize
4. Scheduled hardforks to keep asic resistance vs fixed proof of work that leads to high hashrate via asic
5.  Steeply reducing block reward though maintaining a tail emission vs gently reducing block reward
None of these (including the first one) are slam dunk in favour of one coin. You could argue every one of these, reasonably, in favour of either approach. Since the game theory as to who will win is rather hard to predict, what's not to like about having both? 
These two are the gold standard of crypto. I own bitcoin (57%) and Monero (22%) in my crypto portfolio.

Hashrate falling is not a major threat for Bitcoin. When mining becomes unprofitable, some miners start switching off and this manifests in lower hashrate and slower blocks. But every 2016 blocks, the difficulty adjusts such that with the average hashrate seen over the previous 2016 blocks, the new difficulty would again see 10 min blocks on average. The reduced difficulty eases the situation for remaining miners. If it is still unprofitable, the same thing repeats and miners who remain into next difficulty cycle again see better times. This happens until enough miners leave and the adjusted difficulty once again makes mining profitable for the miners who remained. 
The only problem can be if a very large proportion of miners left together in the middle of a 2016 block cycle in which case the remaining blocks can take a very long time to finish this putting pressure on transaction confirmations and fees. But with the competitive decentralised nature of bitcoin mining, it rarely happens that miners will leave together at the same time, especially as mining costs vary vastly across the globe.
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:47:35
Actually there are many who thought Bitcoin was a high return low risk aka 'get rich quick ' scheme. Because maybe they evaluated it by looking at data for 2017 alone. You see very few periods where you made losses and many where you made gains. So high return low risk. Bingo.
Buy by the same logic, now they will evaluate it as high risk low return by looking only at 2018 data. This ensures that those buying in now are a strong hodler layer which lay a sold new base for the next rise. And that lasts until the next round of noob logic kicks in...
