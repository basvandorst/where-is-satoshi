I am still trying to get a new machine or a refund as they sent me a defective one. :/ They took it in for repairs for a month and never repaired anything.

Does your Ultrapro have bad back-light bleed? I own one as well and system76 support is awful so far. All they do is argue with you about repairs they never did. I am pretty sure they sold me a referb laptop as well.

As an owner of a System76 Galago Ultrapro laptop. Stay away. They swear up and down it's "their custom made laptop" but in reality it is a lower grade Clevo W740SU which is used by a bunch of other companies. Their main support guy Bjor tried to say a bunch of crap saying it's custom made but here is proof.
Here are other laptops that are precisely the specifications of the custom made Galago Ultrapro.
Zeus Hercules
Clevo W740SU
SAGER NP2740
AVA Direct
Schenker s413
