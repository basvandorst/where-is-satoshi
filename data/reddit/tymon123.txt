I don't understand all the "it actually works!". Why would anyone doubt it? I thought the criticism was about the way it is implemented, not whether it works or not.

You said the same thing when Bitcoin was at $10.

This is no rebound. It's obviously the "back to normal" before the real dip. I'm hodling anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:35:45
It will.

Google Translate? The text makes no sense.

Again, the Bitcoin Gold fork is shown as well. Are you blind? What exactly is shady?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:48:27
Bitcoin Gold is literally right there. Also, it shows major events in general (most of them negative) and to say Bitcoin Cash was not a significant one is just dellusional. Nice try though.

Why would I sell? I will buy loads.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:08:57
What the hell? That was uncalled for.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:44:36


Uhm, that's nothing and we will for sure see these numbers very soon without affecting much. $100k will be just another milestone.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:04:11
Very immature. Why not rename all coins called Bitcoin to B-something then?
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:12:36
How do you handle taxes?
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:18:38
You should be banned.

Can you please stop using the word "cockhead"? Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:21:15
It's very disgusting. You should say "dickhead" instead.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:00:29
I would. I prefer a good-looking game even if it gives me disadvantages. Not everyone cares about winning.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:55:58
No, it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:16:41
And why would you do that when there are coins with algorithms that actually work with CPUs? Mining Bitcoin in the browser is nonsense. You will get 100000% better return if you mine Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:32
Neither this script nor other browser-mining scripts utilize WebGL. Coinhive targets Cryptonight where CPUs work almost as good as a GPUs.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:07:23
Your comment completely backfired anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:44:53
No, security by obscurity is an anti-pattern.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:02:25
Moosti is using Coinhive which is definitely not utilizing the GPU. It's a WebAssembly CPU miner running in a WebWorker so it's not blocking the main thread.
Quote from Coinhive's website:




If that's not enough to convince you their slogan is "Monetize Your Business With Your Users' *CPU* Power".

WW3 will be the greatest thing ever for hodlers. When all other currencies crash and become useless Bitcoin will stand strong and we become gods in the New World.
