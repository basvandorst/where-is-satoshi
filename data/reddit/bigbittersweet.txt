hmm, the result was not that bad actually. The moment i started to think of buying bitcoin was 2017 august and the max amount of money i would have had courage to use back then would have been 1000$, probably closer to 500$.

yeah, i think too that this is the last moment to hop on before moon
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:21:50
It's a good day to buy hard
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:52:21
What this?
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:53:51
Technically speaking, if you buy in at 13$ and sell at 9$, you lost $. Yes, you can lose money on investments, gambling or whatever you want to call it
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:51:42
bought somewhere around 13$... should I wait or buy more now?
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:38:27
or sell half now and buy more if it dips more?
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:47:19
Well, in our dreams at least

What if people have realised that bitcoin is not worth 10k, because it always crashes and you can buy it cheaper. Is it possible that it never achieves 20k?

buy the dip! buy the dip! buy the dip! PANIC MODE ONN FOMOFOMOFOMO
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:05:42
Hoping for dip so that i could buy more...
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:18:48
Do you come from a land down under, where women glow and men plunder? Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? You better run, you better take cover!!!!

i'm holding happily because why not – no one invests more than they can afford to lose, right? Bought at 12k so i am going to hold for a while before there is any reason for me to sell, lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:50:19
Am i the only one who made the biggest purchase pretty much at the moon and is still feeling pretty desperate
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:24:13
no, you just end up living in a land down under
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:35:39
nah, just going to buy more and more and making big$$$$ after this dip turns to moon

Ok, so it seems that a lot has happened in 2018 and for a bc-noob it's kinda hard to keep up. So what are the "facts" that support bitcoin going to the moon? And what kind of facts are against bitcoin mooning? No "i feel like bitcoin is the future" -comments here.
At least, what I have found out is that there is no sign of banning bitcoin, or is there? There is no sign that the banning for example in S-K will happen. There has been some banks that are trying to make buying bitcoin harder – for example in Finland Nordea prohibited bitcoin and other crypto investments from all of their workers.
