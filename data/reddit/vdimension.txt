 **Only Bitcoin Holders Can Unlock the Ultimate Wealth Miracle**
Time flies. Bitcoin is already on its 10th anniversary. Even today I remember when Bitcoin wallets came with a built-in mining function, and the happiness the first time I got 50 Bitcoin off CPU power. Even to this day, I’m thankful for those friends who’ve held this common belief. In these 10 years, we’ve built so many miracles together. I trust that this time, we can still bring some surprises for everybody.  
VDS has carried on the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto, continuing on decentralization and the defense of privacy.  
Let these thoughts be delivered so as to inspire the modern people to re-acquaint themselves with this world.  
Bitcoin players should all know clearly, the success of Bitcoin originates from its decentralized nature. If we were to participate in the ecological development of Bitcoin in its earliest developmental stages, in those early days it was out of interest and hobby. However, the majority of information received about Bitcoin comes from that which is shared among friends- because they have the passion to spread this info with others.  
So, for a decentralized product, word-of-mouth is of vital importance.  
But as the crypto industry comes to the attention of mainstream society, people forget the essence of decentralization, however this essence is the strongest power of our group.  
In order to reawaken this power and solve the problems present in our society; VDS, built on blockchain technology, has designed and developed a system that relies on transaction signatures to connect multi-level interpersonal promotion revenues. Under complete decentralization and transparency, promoters can earn massive revenues and allow more people to join in the ecology to increase cash flows within the system. The final result is a net-win for everybody who participates; we call it the Trust Stamp Network.  
The Trust Stamp Network is a fission promotion system composed of interpersonal relationship pyramids. However, Bitcoin players need to activate these pyramids; only those players holding at least 0.1 Bitcoin on the 558,000th Bitcoin block qualify to activate a pyramid and obtain the Genesis VID at the very top.  
Based on the numbers from the Bitcoin blockchain, the number of people who hold this qualification could possibly exceed 2 million.  
Claiming a Genesis VID is free of charge, no Bitcoin need be paid. An empty private key can still perform the operation so it’s extremely safe.  
VDS considers Bitcoin to be the most widely used crypto in the world, a strategy like this can allow VDS players to disseminate to every corner of over the globe, this is extremely important for a new currency.  
After Bitcoin players get a new Genesis VID they can earn Vollar through fission promotions. This is the best cash flow system you’ve ever seen. You only need to let your friend pay 10 Vollar towards your VID, he/she can then acquire their own VID address. You will also receive 4 Vollar as a reward for this, and that is also to say any given VID needs only to push VDS to 3 other friends, adding them into the Trust Stamp Network and then you’ve already made a return on investment, however this is just the beginning.  
Every VID in the Trust Stamp Network has a 12-level Trust Stamp System, and every VID can fission out 12 VID relation locks, that is also to say any VID can fission out approximately 9.7 trillion new VIDs. After the 12 spots in the first level of our Trust Stamp System are full, any VID that invites a new VID into one of the 12 levels in our Trust Stamp System will bring a 0.5 Vollar reward to us. A revenue multiplier like this will make for an astronomical number, and on top of that this is a never-ending, unstoppable game.  
Since all the revenue distributions are clear on the VDS chain, just like Nakamoto’s unstoppable Bitcoin, even the VDS Devs themselves have no way to shut VDS down.  
The most interesting part is that this is not only a one-time promotions game, this is a real-life version Ready Player One competition for Bitcoin distribution rights. Every week the system will calculate the Top 10 most excellent promoters to receive huge amounts of Bitcoin rewards, yeah that’s right, Bitcoin.  
The Bitcoin rewards handed out for the competition are generated from VDS Resonance Trade, a kind of cross-chain one-way Vollar exchange channel that allows Bitcoin players to obtain more legal tenders under absolutely anonymous conditions. However, the Bitcoin from Resonance Trades is paid directly to the winners of the fission promotion competition.  
This is the experience of perfection that VDS has brought to cryptocurrency players, and more so it is the full unification of the power of Bitcoin believers.  
In the name of decentralization, let us once again sound the horns of war.  
The final victory belongs to each and every one of us.  
Nothing is eternal, only thoughts will last forever.

 **VDS Competition for Bitcoin Genesis Game Start**
Through two years of design and development, $20 million USD in investments, V-Dimension fully adheres to the ideas of decentralization and pays attention to the user experience of every player. Through the product’s perfect design which makes cryptocurrency even more powerful, the charm of blockchain technology will be displayed for the whole world to see.  
 
On V-Day, 14th February 2019, VDS chain will officially activate, the Genesis Game to fight for Bitcoin will begin.  
This is the cryptocurrency industry’s first real-life version Ready Player One fight for Bitcoin distribution rights, a competition of unstoppable circulation, this is the first “re-distribution of Bitcoin”.  
The Bitcoin produced by the ICEX high-multiplier phase will all serve as Fission Promotion rewards, and given out to the Top 10 and Lucky 20 light master nodes through Resonance Trade. ICEX will at minimum raise 1,150 Bitcoin. If this number hasn’t yet been reached at the end of ICEX, it means this project startup was a failure and the VDS Team will return the Bitcoin received to the original addresses within 24 hours. If the plan is a success, the competition winners of the first 21 Games including the Genesis Game get this minimum guaranteed Bitcoin reward. This was designed to kick-start the VDS chain, and it’s called “The Spring Rain Plan”.  
All the ICEX-raised Bitcoin reward is divided into 23 portions. The Genesis game receives 3 portions (at least 150 Bitcoin), after that the 20 Regular Games each get one portion of at least 50 Bitcoin.  
That is also to say the round one Genesis Game rewards are at least 3 times higher than the rewards in Regular Phase games.  
Blocks 0-30,239 of the VDS chain (approx. three weeks) are the Genesis Phase. Any VID address can join in on the fight for Bitcoin, use VDS’s decentralized wallet app, and through fission promotions- invite other people to pay 10 Vollar to their own VID address, easily gaining fission-weighted points. At last the VDS chain will count up the Top 10 players to become the Game’s Top 10 winners who will the receive Bitcoin rewards.  
Together, through “The Spring Rain Plan”, Fission Promotions and under the stimulation of Bitcoin, the VDS community will rapidly channel in a massive volume of users. Due to the attendance of this mass of users, everybody will purchase 10 Vollar to create their VID address and make Fission Promotions the Vollar market purchase demand will gradually rise, however the Vollar circulating on the market is limited, and this kind of situation will definitely make Vollar’s price expand.  
The price of Vollar will continuously climb, it will bring in gigantic returns for Bitcoin users who participate in ICEX, and at last be a total-win for everybody in the VDS society.  
Finally, we hope and pray that all participants can reap the stupendous spoils of the Genesis Game.  
The Fission of Life is infinite, the Vastness of the Universe is Limited.
