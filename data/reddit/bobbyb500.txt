Kraken offers a USDT/USD trading pair that works same as their other trading pairs: that is, you can buy USDT from other Kraken users who are selling it in exchange for USD; or, you can sell USDT to other Kraken users who want USD. You're not "redeeming" USDT from Kraken directly.

Jesus fucking christ. 
1. Never invest or risk more than you are willing to lose. Never. Whenever you invest or risk money on something, assume that the money has been spent, is now gone, and will give you no return on that risk. If you are not OK with that, then you should not be risking that money. Even if you have faith that the price of a bitcoin is going to go up.
2. I have complete faith in Bitcoin. My faith has nothing to do with the price. My faith in bitcoin has everything to do with the fact that Bitcoin works. Bitcoin does what it is supposed to do, and it does it exactly how it is supposed to do it. There might be some issue or problem in the future that might shake my faith, but right now, there are no problems for me; there are only potential issues or problems, and I don't care about those until they actually become problems.

The question really is whether or not you want to trust Coinbase. I personally have been given no reason to distrust Coinbase, and I think they seem to be secure. But I don't keep my bitcoins there because I don't want to or need to trust anyone other than myself to keep my bitcoin secure. If you trust yourself to put your bitcoins safely in an offline wallet, then do that. If you don't trust yourself with such valuable technology, then I think Coinbase is would be good for you.

If you're perfectly happy with the way money or banking works in today's world, then there might be very little about bitcoin that is going to interest you.
But maybe you think money and banking don't really take full advantage of the internet. And really, think about how many things computers can do instantly. So why, then,  will my bank process a transaction from my account when I don't have sufficient funds? Can't a computer easily see that I don't have this money? And then the bank wants to charge you money for that, basically passing on the cost of that inefficiency directly to you. 
Why does it take 10 days for a check to clear?
Why does it cost $25 to send a wire transfer overseas? 
If I had a million dollars in a bank account, and I wanted the bank to give me half a million dollars in cash, why can't they just give me my money?
How can bitcoin do these things?
Banks want you to give them your money in exchange for a service. Bitcoin is an attempt to provide many of the same services, execute those services better than banks can, and do so for a small fraction of the cost.

See [my reply to OP]( It'd be more along the lines of a nice thing to do. Maybe an organization provides interest-free loans to low risk candidates because they have the money to do so. Maybe they do this because this organization also sells stuff, and wants to help its public image, if we need a purely capitalistic reason for a company to do so. Or maybe it's an organization purely based on charitable donations which exists solely for this reason. I don't think interest-free loans will be the norm if bitcoin succeeds, but there's a lot fewer negatives than with an inflationary currency.
I'm also not saying I expect any organization to give interest-free loans to anyone who walks in the door. Some people can obviously be more trusted than others to pay back a loan.

That's because the Coinbase wallet is not guaranteed to send bitcoins immediately. It sometimes takes up to an hour. But Bitpay's invoice is only valid for 15 minutes, so by the time Coinbase actually sent the coins, Bitpay may have closed the invoice. Contact Bitpay, they should be able to help you by properly relaying the transaction to the merchant.

A buy limit order is filled when someone is willing to sell to you at a price equal to or greater than your bud. If someone was willing to sell for $500, then that very same person will sell at $506.23, because they'll make more money. The exchange not only fucked over both OP, who was willing to buy at 506.23, but also whoever sold below that, because the exchange was (or should have been) aware that someone was willing to give at least one of those sellers a better price.

I've never been sure it should be a retailer's responsibility to take the hit when there's a transaction in stolen money. If my bitcoins are stolen on my watch, I think it should be my loss until I can recoup that loss from whoever stole them; when someone is proven to have stolen my bitcoins, then it's their responsibility to pay me back. A retailer is a third party in the matter, and shouldn't be required to pay my loss out of pocket because a thief chose that particular business to further their crime. 
One of the things I love about Bitcoin is the prospect of a greater societal emphasis on personal responsibility. It is possible to secure your bitcoins so that they can never be stolen from you. If you don't do that, why should anyone else besides the thief compensate you when your coins are stolen? Or, if you are storing your coins in a third party's wallet, the theft is between you, your thief, and that third party. But if your thief buys something on (my example business, for the rest of the post,) Newegg, why should Newegg be responsible? How did they wrong you such that they owe you the money that was stolen from you?
So, ethically speaking, I think they would have minimal liability. Legally speaking, I think they might very well be liable, but I would hope the theft would have to be proven first.

Ok, that's some good context. You should put that into your post. But I'm still unconvinced of your sincerity. You don't like bitcoin users attempts to convince you of its value; can we state that as granted? I'd like to hear your justifications against using bitcoin rather than your complaints against its users.
In that article you linked me, it quoted one of the replies to your original comment: "Bitpay? No risk and you pay 1%. How can you say that doesn’t save you on 3% credit card fees?". The article attempts to contextualize that comment as "the same tired schtick" and compares it to comments calling you "a liar, a troll". But I am, sincerely, curious; how would you answer that? Why doesn't that save you in credit card fees? I'm not asking because I know for a fact that using BitPay or Coinbase will save you money; I don't know that, while you seem to know for a fact that it will not save you any money. Would you be willing to elaborate?

That's a natural perspective, but I believe you have to be able to think clearly while making trading decisions, and worrying about whether or not you're going to lose money is a big inhibitor of thinking clearly; so, I always pre-define my risk level, the maximum loss I'm willing to take in this trade, and spend that much to enter a position. That money is gone, in the sense that I've bought the opportunity to take even more money out of the market.

For Macs I highly recommend the firewall program Little Snitch. It lets you allow or disallow connections on a case-by-case basis and allows you to set rules for which programs can connect to which web addresses over which ports. By default it will ask before allowing a connection unless you've explicitly allowed it permission.
So if someone tries to VNC into your computer, you would've had to allow the VNC server to connect to that particular address or Little Snitch would pop up on your machine and ask you whether to allow it; if somehow a keylogger managed to get installed on your machine, it might record your passwords, but it can't send them to anyone unless you've allowed that keylogger program to connect to the internet.
The only proper solution to completely secure your coins from malware is to have an offline wallet, either paper or an offline PC. But for a hot wallet on a Mac, Little Snitch definitely gives some added peace-of-mind.

There you go again with the "we". Please don't do that, you or anyone else reading this. Speak for yourself, speak your own opinions and identify them as solely your own. When it comes to matters of what other people are thinking, none are qualified to speak for anyone else but themselves. Feel free to *speculate* what people are thinking, but identify your statements as mere speculation. When citing facts, try to be explicit as to what those facts mean to you; don't just mention a statistic and leave it for everyone else to infer what point you are trying to get across. Ask questions of which the answers might prove the point of either side of the discussion.


I, too, would like this. I would also like to see more people admit that they might be wrong and that others' criticisms are valid. I might very well have been wrong when I said *your* post was meant to antagonize, so I'm going to go strike that from my original post. But you are right that a lot of things are said here that are wholly unsupported by any facts, and I would love to see us act individually and collectively to point out when this happens.

Regarding your point on loans: Wouldn't banks only have to charge minimal interest rates? If a bank were to loan me a bitcoin, and I pay back that bitcoin over the course of the next five years, they would have made money since the bitcoin will be more valuable in five years. I don't think they'd have to charge *any* interest ; the bank would still come out ahead.
Regarding minimum wage: You're right, a fixed minimum wage wouldn't work. I imagine any wage or salary would have to be lowered incrementally to account for the increasing value of money. A raise could become earning the same amount of money as you did last year. It will take a shift in public perception for this to be accepted, and I think this is a huge hurdle to overcome. Can the average person learn to separate the number of units of money from the value of that money? Can they start thinking, "a bitcoin in a year is worth more than that bitcoin today," or will they get caught up in, "you paid me a full bitcoin for this work last year, and this year you want to pay me less than that" as a grievance? 
But on the other side of the coin, you will also have to have prices falling incrementally to counter this. Something that cost 1 bitcoin last year should cost less than a bitcoin this year. Could price-cuts outweigh pay-cuts in the public mindset? Would it balance out in their minds? I don't know, and while I doubt it will be an easy shift to make, I don't think it's an impossible one.

Yeah, the interest rate a bank charges for a loan would have to be the incentive for not just holding the money, and would also have to be enough to outweigh the risk. It would take a benevolent sort of bank to give out loans without interest, but it could be done if they found the risk to be minimal, because they could still make money on the value growth of the loan.

Not only that, but if it turns out that the leak is due to a security failure from Apple (I've only heard rumors that the leak was from iCloud, I've not seen any confirmation), that's an issue that can be compared favorable with bitcoin. "We can send money without having to trust a 3rd party, but for pics we just have to trust apple or google not to peep?"
But there's the possibility of a negative backlash as well. It is bitcoin, after all, which allowed this 'bad actor' to be payed anonymously for these stolen pics. However, if its true that TMZ offered money for them, then clearly the pics could have been paid for and distributed thru more established channels even if bitcoin wasn't an option.

Coinbase acts as a wallet, a broker, and a payment processor. I think the brokerage services are their bread and butter, and if they focused purely on that, I'd be completely satisfied with them. But instead they feel the need to branch out, which I don't fault them for, but I think they've spread themselves a bit thin.
Meanwhile, BitPay is purely a payment processor. They do that one thing, and they do it better than anyone else. They are focused on that, while Coinbase seems unfocused by comparison.

Whether or not it actually said anything of any relevance (before you deleted it to complain) is guesswork on the part of anyone attempting to contextualize this for themselves. Then you make a complaint post on which once again omits what you actually said. Hell, in the post, you have a pretty shady looking link which, from my perspective, looks to be an attempt to get past reddit's non-participation rules. And once more, in this very post, you manage to complain about bitcoin zealots while not talking about what might have attracted their ire.

I mean, how could Internet currency be worth anything? Can't people just make as many bitcoins as they want? But I kept seeing it there, and still kept seeing it, until eventually I got curious enough to ask myself, "Ok, how does this bitcoin thing work? Is it somehow not obviously a scam?" So I looked into it further and learned what every bitcoin enthusiast knows: that it's brilliant. But if it weren't for my seeing mentions of it pretty consistently to the point where it was starting to annoy me, I'd have written it off as a phase or a scam, and not thought twice about it.

Hold on, let me go find the last comment I made about risk and investing...
 &gt;Never invest or risk more than you are willing to lose. Never. Whenever you invest or risk money on something, assume that the money has been spent, is now gone, and will give you no return on that risk. If you are not OK with that, then you should not be risking that money. Even if you have faith that the price of a bitcoin is going to go up.
Ok. Now, if you can do that, feel free to risk however much you are comfortable with. Also, this is almost exactly what day traders do. What you're describing is in no way specific to bitcoin. Maybe you should look into Forex trading? You can start that with a pretty small account size and still not have to risk too much per trade.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:04:23
I've said this in a couple other threads in the past week, but that's because I really, truly think it's the most important part of trading and investing.


I know this doesn't really answer your question about whether *now* is the time to buy, but I think that's a really subjective question. Is it the right time for *you* to buy? I think you're the most qualified to answer that, even if you come to that decision based on advice from people you deem more knowledgeable on the subject. But don't just blindly follow someone's advice; use someone else's advice to inform your own decision.

Assuming his order was in before the price traded that low, OP should have been partially filled, at the very least, before anyone was able to buy at a price lower than that. If only 1 satoshi was traded at 500, it should have been traded at 506.23 first, because obviously the person selling that 1 satoshi would take the extra 6.23 per bitcoin. Mt Gox would have had to ignored his order to let someone sell at a lower price.

You don't need to use the console at all anymore; all the necessary options are in the menus now. 
To set up a watch-only wallet on your online PC: 
* From the offline wallet: Go to Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key. Copy this string to a flash drive and move to your online PC.
* From the online wallet: Go to File -&gt; New/Restore. Choose a place to save the new wallet file. and then in the electrum dialog box choose "Create a watching-only version of an existing wallet". The next dialog will ask for your Master Public Key, so paste in that string you copied from the offline PC.
So now you have a normal electrum wallet on an offline PC and a watch-only wallet on an online PC. Now, to create a transanction:
* On the Online PC, in the watch-only wallet, create a transaction in the Send tab. Type in an address and amount, just as you would with a normal transaction. However, you'll notice that the 'Send' button has been replaced with a "Create unsigned transaction" button. A dialog box will open with all the details of your transaction. Hit Save. Save this file to a flash drive.
* Offline PC: In electrum, go to Tools -&gt; Load Transaction -&gt; From file. Select your transaction file. A similar dialog box with all the transaction details will open, but now with a "Sign" option on the bottom. Hit that, it'll ask for your password. The dialog box will now show a TxID. Hit Save once again, and put this new file on your flash drive.
* Online PC: Once again go to Tools -&gt; Load Transaction -&gt; From file and select your signed transaction file. That transactions details dialog box will open once again, but now with a "Broadcast" button on the bottom. Hit that, and you've just sent a transaction from an offline wallet.

There's no ill will behind mining an empty block. After a new block is mined, miners have to verify that block. If someone quickly mines a second new block before they've verified the first one, they won't know what transactions have been included in the first one. They could wait while they verify the first block, find out which transactions haven't been included, add those into the second block, and reap the extra transaction fees. But the longer they wait, the more likely it is that someone else will mine that block instead. It makes more sense to broadcast the block as soon as it's been mined, which means forgoing verifying the previous block.
Maybe as transaction fees go up relative to the block reward, this practice will be less incentivized.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:30:03
I think the question will be if the market will follow the miners to the BU chain, or, if they don't, how long until the miners come back to the Core chain.
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:16:29
They mined a new block faster than they could verify the transactions from the previous block. So they couldn't include any transactions because they don't know which transactions were already included in the previous block. They COULD wait, but then they risk someone else mining the block.

You could use both. The Bitpay wallet is basically the same as Copay; they're both maintained by Bitpay the company. The Copay wallet is meant to be an open source wallet with no real allegiance to any company, while the Bitpay wallet can integrate more directly with Bitpay's services.  
The seed phrase you generate in one can be input in the other. If you do this, when you add or spend any funds from one app, the transactions will be kept up to date in the other. So you can try them both out and decide for yourself.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:10:50
The Bitpay and Copay wallet apps are free. Sending a bitcoin transaction will include a fee, which the wallet adds automatically. I'm not exactly sure how the wallet calculates the fee, but the appropriate fee right now, according to [bitcoinfees.21.co]( is 0.0003164 BTC, or ~$0.30 USD, and I'm pretty sure the wallets will be in that ballpark.

Well, Segwit got off to a much stronger start, but BIP66 looks like it had much more consistent growth. BIP66 never seems to have encountered the stagnation in adoption that Segwit has had since it got to ~25%.
I'm very excited about Segwit, and I'm definitely not in the camp of "Segwit is dead, it'll never reach 95%", but the apparent lack of any new miners signalling for it since early December has been gradually tempering my optimism. Are there still any mining pools that intend to signal for Segwit but have not yet updated their software to do so? Are the majority of holdouts intending not to signal for activation? Or is this more of a situation where we don't really know what the miners intentions are?

Have you tried Copay? It's multi-platform, it's deterministic, and you can create multi-signature wallets. You can create a wallet on an offline computer, export it without the private key, and import it into the iOS version, allowing you to view the activity of the offline addresses without being able to spend them on the iPhone. I'm not sure about the Korean language option, however, and I doubt it can pull the price from Korbit.

They haven't deprecated Copay, they are still developing it, AFAIK. In an AMA a little while back, they described it as Copay wallet : Bitpay wallet :: Chromium : Chrome.

Yes, that's 100% true. You haven't lost the coins. 
But OP asked, "Do I own bitcoin on the 2 chains?" You would own coins on both chains if you controlled the private keys. If you have 1 bitcoin in address "123" prior to the fork, then after the fork, you could send 1 bitcoin to address "456" on one chain, and then also send 1 bitcoin to "789" on the other chain.
But if you have your coins stored on a web wallet, then after a fork the web wallet will not be operating on both chains. It will have either stuck with the original chain or changed to the new one. So now, you won't be able to spend your bitcoin on both chains, unless you have the cooperation of the web wallet.
@_date: 2015-08-07 13:41:40

It's 95% of signalling, not 75%, so yes, it seems like waiting for miners to signal will result in SegWit not activating. But alternative ways of activating Segwit, such as UASF (user activated soft fork), seem to be gaining traction, so we'll see how it develops.

You don't have to do it through the console. You can create a wallet on the online PC with the Master Public Key from the offline wallet, and then create unsigned transactions in the GUI, which creates a file of the unsigned transaction. Then you transfer it to the offline PC, sign it there which creates a new file of the signed transaction, then bring it back to the online PC.

I'm not sure if you could actually do this yet, but I think there is a way to have a transaction executed only after a certain block height. So you could be able to automate your manual solution. You create transaction T2 to execute only after block H, using the same funds as transaction T. T2 just moves your bitcoin to a different address you control. So, if T is executed by block H, then T2 will be invalid; if T isn't executed in time, then T2 executes and makes any future attempt at T invalid. 
Again, I'm not sure if there's a way to do this yet, but IIRC it was being talked about at least. Sorry, I can't actually remember what the technical term for it was.

I had a transaction cancelled yesterday. I was very upset about it and sent an email to their support staff. Early this morning they wrote me back and were very apologetic, explained how new parameters introduced into their risk detection system were causing some hiccups, and undid the cancellation. So long as they've got people willing to correct the mistakes of an automatic system, I'll be very happy to continue using their services. Considering how quickly they fixed my issue I think I might be happier than I was before this incident, since now I know I can trust their customer support staff.

What you're looking for is called a stop order, and most exchanges do NOT offer it. BitFinex is the only exchange I know of that does offer it. The other exchanges only offer limit orders, which means that you will sell when the price gets high enough or buy when it gets low enough.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:22:50
You can't sell below market value. The lowest price you can sell at is by placing a market order, which sells to the highest bidders. You can't just skip those bids at higher prices. On an exchange anyway. If you want to sell to someone in person below market value, that's another story.

I don't know of anyone who talked with customer support who didn't have their issues resolved, save for some people who removed their bank account info before Coinbase could rectify the problem, and just because a user is impatient doesn't mean they're being scammed.  


I definitely don't think they cancel an order because they don't have the amount necessary to credit, but I could be wrong. I've no proof they don't do this, nor do you have proof they do. They very well could be scamming people, but I think it's a stretch to believe that without any evidence. When these issues arise and the support staff is notified, not only do they fix the issue of the moment, but they also whitelist your account to prevent the issue from happening again. They are usually communicative, helpful, and actually fix the issues, while a scammer might be communicative, but once they have your money, they won't usually take the time to help you or fix your problem. From what I've seen, Coinbase wants people's business rather than just their money; they seem to want their customers to keep using their service. 
I completely understand someone not wanting to use this service because it still has its share of issues. It's still in beta, so by definition it's not for everyone. But all the issues that have arisen that might suggest Coinbase is scamming people could be much more simply explained by software issues.
Coinbase could be a giant long con. Mt. Gox could be a giant long con. Bitcoin could be a giant long con. I don't think any of that is true, but I'll eat my words if I'm wrong.

Edit: Nope, not the first sentence, but in the middle of the post. Jeez, I'm really not paying enough attention. 
Good for BitFinex then, I've always liked their site. Besides margin trading, their the only site I know of that offers stop orders, which I think is incredibly important and a huge oversight by the other exchanges.

Very interesting. I too would like to hear more about this issue from Coinbase. It has very negative potential consequences, and I would like to hear an in depth explanation of it. I also wonder, if you had no pending transactions, how the issue would have been handled.

Coinbase. They're not shutting down for the week. "We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today," is what it says, and furthermore, though it isn't outright stated, it's well known that they use a rolling 24 hours to determine "today", so they could be back to selling in a matter of minutes, or, more likely, hours. But they are not shut down for the week.

Last time I used it, it was whatever the price was when they send your bitcoins. Last time I used it was back when the price was at $10 or $11 so this might not be up to date.

As far as I can tell, they do. When I go to place an order, they have a line for one URL, and a box for "Additional product URLs and notes". Is that not what you mean, or are you just looking for a spot to place single URLs for each item you want to order?
Also, when you say that your amazon order shipped by prime, you had nothing to do with that, correct? I should assume every amazon order would ship with prime?

That assumes only one address per person, which is simply not the case. I don't think there's a way to estimate how many people have &gt;= 1 bitcoin unless you could figure out an average number of addresses per person, and even then it'd be a rough estimate. 
@_date: 2013-02-24 02:43:22
Yes, I agree they seem to be having more than their fair share of issues. I think their user base must have increased dramatically since reddit announced they were going to accept bitcoin, so the number of users with issues has increased at a similar, if not higher rate. I'm glad to hear you haven't jumped on the 'I'm being scammed' bandwagon that seems to be the natural, fearful reaction when this happens. 
I was very angry when they cancelled my order, but after I emailed them, support reversed the cancellation by the next morning, which greatly raised my confidence in them. This was no more than a week after the first reports of cancellations happened, but long enough that I had read one or two reports. Had they not reversed it, I'd imagine myself still being angry with them, potentially to the point of no longer using them. Maybe since you were one of the first people this happened to, the support staff hadn't yet taken the stance of reversing these cancellations; maybe they wanted, at first, to let the risk-detection software sort itself out, but later decided to fix the issues manually when they kept popping up so quickly.

Did this get 50 upvotes in 4 minutes?
Edit: Ok, what's going on here? I thought this was a pretty innocuous comment, but I racked up the downvotes pretty quickly. I mean I think OP's question is one worthy of reasonable discussion, but for just a question with no new content, I thought this post got a disproportionate number of votes, so I asked about it. What aren't I getting?
As to the question at hand, I don't have a strong feeling about BTC vs mBTC, but I think the reasoning behind the switch to mBTC is still valid unless the price gets to the point where a mBTC is worth less than $0.01.

Interesting, and a little disappointing, I'll admit. I'm still of the opinion you've been affected by buggy software rather than scammed, but my enthusiasm for their support has been slightly tempered by your account. I'm curious, how long after your order was cancelled did you contact support? Not that a delay on your part, within reason, excuses your issue being unresolved. Also, am I right to assume that it was a maximum purchase (10, maybe 100 BTC) that was cancelled? Lastly, I take it you've since stopped using Coinbase? Was this the only issue you experienced or were there others? Did you remove your bank account info or simply stop buying from them?
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:21:53
I completely agree. I think 'mill' is the way to go, especially if the public can make the connection to 'cent'. In the same vain, we can use 'mics' (pronounced 'mikes') when/if μBTC becomes a viable unit of exchange. We could add a 'bit-' prefix (bitmill, bitmic) if people think it's necessary for Bitcoin-specific terms, but I like to think that Bitcoin can become pervasive enough that it isn't neeeded. I could also live with m-bits and u-bits, since they roll off the tongue pretty easily as well, but I like mills and mics better. But I think anything more than 2 syllables is too cumbersome for everyday use.

BitPay does not use Mt Gox prices, not even averaged with Bitstamp and others. In fact their price is not determined with an average, but with the best sell price of the exchanges that have "adequate liquidity and withdrawal capability in USA and the Eurozone", and Mt Gox does not meet that qualification. BitPay's price almost always lines up with BitStamp.
Now, there is a price gap between BitStamp and BTC-E or CampBX which could probably be taken advantage of in this manner, but I personally don't have enough trust in BTC-E to send them money, and CampBX has incredibly low volume.

@_date: 2013-02-23 20:07:20
Well I imagine they take so long to be cancelled because they first have to clear the banks. Coinbase can't very well tell its bank to cancel a transaction the bank hasn't yet received. So after the bank clears the transactions, Coinbase software goes through the list of the day's transactions and either clears them to the appropriate accounts or flags them high risk. (All pure speculation on my part, how I think it happens). An admittedly slow, cumbersome process, but low cost bank transfers tend to be a slow, cumbersome process. 
I think in the long run Coinbase would make far more money collecting fees of repeat customers rather than taking money a price move. A business that can't do what its customers want won't survive very long. But Coinbase seems to be in the business of helping its customers when issues arise, and if they planned to fix this high-risk cancellation issue for everyone who asks, they couldn't possibly plan to make money from the error. Rather, I choose to take them at their word, in that they are trying to prevent loss by chargeback by flagging potentially risky transactions.
Lastly, I don't have all that much sympathy for the people who refuse to deal with customer support when they come across an issue in a beta. I can understand being angry over losing money (though losing money and not making money are two different things), because I was angry myself when this issue happened to me, but it is not as though there was no recourse available to them.

They're not really an exchange. You buy coins from them (or sell to them), rather than other people using the site, like on Gox, Bitfloor, etc. If you just want to buy or sell coins Coinbase works, but to trade it's better to use an exchange.

@_date: 2013-02-23 05:07:15
I can understand that viewpoint, but how would you fix the problem without testing? Granted, I don't know (they won't publicly release them) what variables they use to determine what constitutes "high-risk", so I can't say precisely on what kind of scale testing would be necessary, but I'm almost positive that a system like that couldn't be tested entirely in-house.
 
Also, Coinbase is in beta. It's a public test of a system that has not been deemed fit for release. That's not to say it's buggy to the point of being unusable, but users can't really expect an experience that comes completely without issue. Considering that, I think the service works mostly pretty well, and the issues that do arise are quickly handled by the support staff.
@_date: 2013-02-08 01:34:44
Oh I did get that message, and was very pissed about that line in particular. Like I said to them, the only thing my luck should affect is the value of a bitcoin, not whether a transaction is going to go through. They seemed to agree with me though, so no harm done in the end. 
But I would like to see that line about luck changed, it is a bit short of tactful. Something along the lines of 


would have been more appropriate, I think.

Mt Gox has been consistently $10-$15 higher than the other exchanges for at least a couple of months. Because of this, most payment processors, namely Coinbase and BitPay, have stopped using it as their price.
I don't think Coinbase uses the exact same method as BitPay, but BitPay [uses this method]( to calculate their price, and I'd guess Coinbase uses a similar method of price calculation.

I've seen a lot of complaints about Coinbase lately, but I feel it's much more relevant that I have yet to read about anyone emailing their support staff and not having their problem dealt with. Everyone who has said something along the lines of "I've emailed their support staff and..." finished that thought with their issue being resolved, myself included. In some cases I've read of their staff above and beyond the call of duty by sending an extra bitcoin for the trouble. But in my mind so long as they address and correct the issues with their software, they've done their job. 
I actually am very curious. Are there any complainants who have received a response from Coinbase support that did not resolve whatever issue they were having? Because, as I said, I have yet to read an account of that happening.

@_date: 2013-02-28 21:08:13
They aren't currently taking any new customers. In early December they announced they'd be opening a website by the end of the year while simultaneously not allowing new customers until the site opens. Now their stance is the website is low priority, because they make enough profit from their current customers, and until they start running low on money to buy people's coins on FastCast4Bitcoins they won't even bother with the website or new customers.

BitSpend closed a while back after having their bank accounts frozen. Beyond that, we don't really know what happened except that a good amount of people who ordered from them right before they closed did not get their orders fulfilled. There's been pretty much silence from BitSpend regarding this issue.
Bitsumo.com seems to offer the same services Bitspend did. I've never used them before, so I can't give a first hand account of their service, but [the thread on bitcointalk]( seems to indicate favorable reviews.

Yeah, the advantage to Coinbase is the low fee and ease of use. If your going to buy and hold for the long term, Coinbase is a great way to do that. But if you want to day trade, buying at lows and selling at highs on a short term basis, you'd want an exchange.
But even if you're going to trade short term, Coinbase isn't a bad way to buy bitcoins to put into your Mt Gox account. Though, from what I've heard, Bitfloor is also pretty competitive regarding moving money into an exchange.

That's very interesting, this is the first I'm hearing of an issue like  Are you sure this wasn't a superficial reporting issue, like when balances were shown as 0 BTC without corresponding transactions? Did you receive double the amount in your off-site wallet? If so, when you say they "took my account negative" are you saying that they sent more coins than you had, so that with a balance of, for instance, 5 BTC you managed to send yourself 10 BTC? Very curious to hear more about this issue.

I was having this issue as well, showing 0 BTC balance. I sent a small amount, 0.01 BTC, from my external wallet into my Coinbase acct, and as soon as I did, Coinbase showed the entirety of my missing balance and allowed me to withdraw it.
