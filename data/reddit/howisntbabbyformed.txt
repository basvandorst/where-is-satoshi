Umm, except adoption of technology as a percentage of the population by definition can't go above 100%. So if a technology is compelling enough that people generally want it the it will always be asymptotic to 100%. That has nothing to do with prices of financials.
Also, if a trend follows an S-curve, then it is by definition not exponential growth.

I don't necessarily have a problem with that. I was just pointing out that if that's true then bitcoin falls short of its libertarian ideals. Well -- I don't want to anthropomorphize bitcoin -- it falls short of the rhetoric of many if its libertarian proponents.

If only that were true! Everyone figures out what they want to make in dollars first and then back figures what that is in bitcoins. Over the one year period when bitcoin went from $10 to $1000, did merchants keep their BTC/goat prices the same? Because I'm guessing the USD/goat price stayed much flatter.


It most certainly does. At least at this point in time and for the foreseeable future it does.


Because inside the eurozone they don't use dollars to buy and sell things, and for the most part they don't care what the current exchange rate is. Fluctuations between those currencies directly impact some areas like imports/exports/tourism, but those take a while to adjust and don't immediately impact the rest of the economy. With bitcoins everyone immediately adjusts their prices for everything to match dollars every second. Imagine the equivalent, a european supermarket where prices were really based in dollars and their prices in euros changed every second based on what the euro was currently trading at. Now imagine every single aspect of the entire eurozone being immediately tied to and converted back to the dollar, then yes, I'd say the euro was backed by the dollar.
As I said before, the only reason these stores exist is because they can currently get their bitcoins out into some fiat currency. So in that case, yes, bitcoins are backed by fiat currencies. If Euros couldn't be exchanged for dollars, people inside the eurozone wouldn't immediately stop using euros.

That's only because your bitcoins skyrocketed in value. That hopefully won't keep happening or else people won't spend their bitcoins very much because they'll always be worth way more in the future. And in your case, a 1-2% fee isn't a big deal because your bitcoins are worth 1000% more than they were a year ago. If the exchange rate for bitcoin stabilizes, those fees become more and more of an issue. And with our cabby friend who wants to change them immediately into dollars, bitcoin's past performance doesn't mean anything.

First of all, the pattern recognition software isn't that good. Like I said, it's not particularly sophisticated. Even on the website it says:


The point is that even a fairly simple pattern recognition algorithm is good at catching patterns in the numbers that humans generate when trying to produce "random" numbers. The point is just to say, "Don't trust the numbers you produce yourself to be random". It isn't saying anything about anything else. Your computer's random number generator may be better or worse than you. But that's not the point. The point is that you're bad. The author goes on to say:


So this is only saying not to use random numbers you made yourself. Use some other source of randomness. Obviously this raises the question, "What source of randomness should I use?" Well, that's something for you to figure out. And if you think you've found a good source of randomness, you can have it generate a bunch of 1s and 0s and try it out on this game and see how it does.

I don't know exactly what you're getting at. If I write a program that can guess what you're going to type next with better than 50% accuracy then you're being less than random. That's all this program shows. Also you can look at the program's source code, it's not an incredibly sophisticated algorithm. Which is why even if you're doing better against this program, you still might not be very random. You're just not producing the type of patterns this program is good at picking up on.
If there was another program generating random numbers, the guesser program might also be able to do better than 50% against it. But that just means the computer isn't perfectly random either. However it's almost guaranteed that you'd do worse than the computer based random number generator.

So your cab driver googles bitcoin, finds out that it's not just a "transaction system" but its own separate currency.

Then I would argue that the USD was never backed by gold. If the central authority behind your currency has the power to say, "Sorry, it's not backed by gold any more", then it never was. You had to have a certain amount of trust that this central authority would give you gold in return for your dollars. If they always had the power to change that, then there was always a non-zero chance that you wouldn't be able to get gold for your dollars.
I don't know exactly how the US left the gold standard (passing a law, executive order, policy decision at the Treasury, etc). But imagine it's the day before leaving the gold standard and you've got $1000. Are you 100% confident that you can change all your dollars to gold? How could you be that confident if the very next day you definitely can't exchange your dollars for gold? So, if the day prior to leaving the gold standard, you can't be totally sure you can get gold for dollars, then I would argue that at no point were your dollars ever 100% backed by gold. There was always some faith involved that the government would give you gold for dollars.

You really like saying bias. I don't think I have a dollar bias. I think I have a useful-as-a-currency bias. and I think the *slow speed* of monetary loss is a much bigger deal than any sort of bias.


Agreed, but if people don't use it for those types of transactions, then it's not very useful and I don't believe it will continue to have value and it will drop in price. As I see it fiat currency's inherent value is that I have to use it to pay the government and literally everyone else in my country accepts it. Bitcoin's only inherent value is its ease of transfer between entities, and if you're of the libertarian bent, all that stuff about being outside the control of any government.


First, I don't believe a deflationary system is a good one to have a lot of value tied up in (I don't think I need to argue this, lot's of economists have weighed in on this one). But more importantly, I don't believe the price of bitcoin will continue to rise for those looking for an investment if its inherent virtues don't actually pan out.


That's exactly what I would want out of a currency, "I got back 10% more BTC than I put in, woohoo!" But everyone else is still comparing the value back to dollars on every single transaction. The strongest advocates (at least on this subreddit) still think about it in dollars which is why I think it won't take off for either camp (day-to-day transaction or investment/savings).

But that was just you. The seller was still thinking in terms of Euros. With bitcoins, both the buyer and seller are *really* thinking in terms of dollars. I think the best thing that could have happened for bitcoin is for it to have stabilized somewhere under $10. There's a bit of psychology that makes people feel better about exchanging similar-ish values, but the more important aspect is the stabilization part. Many people here are cheering for it to go up and up and up, but no one's going to use it as a currency if that happens. The crazy price increases also lead to suspicion of those who got in early at less than $1 (or $10, or even $100) and accusations of it being a ponzi scheme, which I don't agree with, but perception still has power.
And to those saying I don't have a solution... You're absolutely correct. I don't know what I could do to help this. Maybe if more people opened shops where things were really priced in bitcoins that would be better, and people were paid in bitcoins. What might be best is if some small country just decided to adopt bitcoins as their official currency. The only problem with that is if prices continue to increase, no one will want to buy goods from this country and no one will visit this country.

I was being a little snarky with the "backed by" bit. But doesn't it feel that way? The only reason bitcoinstore is selling things in bitcoins is because they are really thinking about them as dollars. How many bitcoin merchants and things like gyft where you buy gift cards in regular old dollars, are just thin shims around dealing in dollars?
