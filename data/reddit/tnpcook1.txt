Because sensationalism is what attracts people.
Price is a simple, and sensationalize-able value that can hit a broad audience, who them become the majority present.

I'm speaking of btc fees, he could get fiat deposits and retain the option to purchase btc, or not, but it might cost exchange fees that the employer may be absorbing here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:18:59
He may also be dodging some fees. Though the employer might include those as deductions.
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:51:18


Storj would disagree.
@_date: 2016-03-13 03:33:36
Its' sole use-case is payment.

Bitfinex's "othercoin" addition
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:43:44
Strongly a thing.
Couldn't even mention a big exchang's feature addition, because the exchange was temporarily censored, to avoid any discourse.
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:52:51


fucking melted down irl
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:55:21
Agnostic to any protocol, economically it is better at present to mine that chain with the same hardware that mines bitcoin.
Bitcoin losing hashpower is a huge problem.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:31:34
is be drive do than government yea more.
fucking what.
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:07:09
That is how I've understood it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:03:05
I've managed to get about 7%, with a handful of lends still out.
So long as the fork coins are worth less than that, I get to feel pretty darn clever.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:39:41
A lot of this runs under the assumption that blockchain technology is exclusively for functionality as a currency and store of value.
Multiple blockchains create an aggressive feature addition and auditing environment where stability is filtered by success.


They should, technological complacency is indicative of a failed technology, it's why bitcoin benefits from mutations.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:40:48
With the increase in resource, either logistic, or validation, I have a hard time understanding how a LN channel would be equal in efficiency.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:55:11
This might not be the best statement, since it's more profitable to mine several other chains.
It's worthwhile to add that bitcoin is also a bit more liquid, or has network penetration. Solely mining profit isn't it's strength.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:17:11
Not buying your own money.
Use a service, pay for the service.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:03:22
I don't get it.
One guy paid less, so he got less.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:30:21
More akin to copying an equal amount of currency to each usd holder, then naming it something else.
The logical question is "why does that rename have value?".
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:13:44
It(silver) must have a separate use-case or mechanism that is mutually exclusive with the primary (gold). Otherwise there isn't reason to fork.
A better analogy would be discovering oil while also using gold, which is functionally different, but still has value.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:31:08
Except the value of that printed silver isnt additive, but derived.
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:31:30
Stop linking shit that is so vague in it's sensationalism.
"Cryptocurrency" can't be hacked as a whole, it's a concept that doesn't apply to one unit.
A better title would be "token treasury account hacked".
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:30:32
The treasury holding funds was hacked, not the coin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:51:43
Other operations and bullshit fractional reserve of banks are agnostic to that machine filling consumer demand for convenience.
If the machine didn't fill a desireable service role, it couldn't charge a fee.
If I use a bitcoin atm, it will also charge a fee, because the provider will certainly not install and maintain the device out of benevolence.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:07:16


Someone ELI5 why there isn't just a majority fork then?
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:03:41


These are all things you want more than being rich.
It's hard to be upset when you've selected your preference.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:05:35


this is something I never expected to read about bitcoin, ever.
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:12:16


This, in addition to the bitcoin feature set with timing improvements.
@_date: 2017-04-21 05:37:28
Good perspective, thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:23:41
Eventually time would make a fool of it, yea.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:22:36
Rationalization via complacency is a bitch.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:19:47


Well that's a shit idea. Exposes several vectors of attack, such as them being able to have some credibility regarding account ownership.
"Yea, I can prove the account is mine, the number is XXXX-",
"the new password is YYYY"
If they're willing to associate their account with coinbase, there isn't any barrier to entry they haven't already overcome that inhibits them from starting their own.
Offer to act as an intermediary and deposit their money, since they are asking similar amounts of trust from you.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:34:00
At best, nothing happens.
At worst, there is potential for compromised personal information, and coinbase closing the account.
Those limits aren't put in for the user's benefit, and they would most likely prefer their delegation of limits maintain fidelity.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:59:11


I would impose that was due to accessibility.
The blockchain economy has rapid data proliferation thanks to existing tools like the internet to speed communications.
The initial online economy didn't have that.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:07:34
Decentralized exchanges Bois.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:55:33
I'm not sure that detail was a fundamental mechanism of the statement.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:28:25
Does this maybe
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:12:29
It usually tracks it pretty sharply :X
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:12:41
The gain between your opening and closing position on each purchase is a capital gains tax.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:19:37
They can regulate mechanisms of access they have agency over though.
Banks, communications.
On the upside, those entities are economically incentivized to partake instead of reject.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:39:12
I prefer the rejection of complacent money in inflationary models, but it just isn't socially stable enough to persist.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:07:29
I'd be more concerned if tentative group organization would have a greater affect on price than existing market mechanisms.
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:38:12
Every moment after you buy, is another evaluation you make potentially resulting in a sell.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:48:55
Pretty much this.
Nothing can conceivably go wrong with exposing a secure device to external connectivity. /s
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:10:03
A physical device , and it's point of interface interface, will never be as completely trustless as a transaction executing on chain.
This sounds like a complicated way to induce risk into a token.
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:43:04
From my understanding, a smart-contract methodology that decentralizes code execution to machines.
Similar to ethereum, but just runs the code on a machine, rather than in a virtual chain environment/state.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:10:40
What if I want to use my crypto for actions that aren't exclusive to currencies.
(like staking)
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:54:20
This is a bit of a fallacy.
It's also up over 10,000% since it started, but I'd still be concerned if it dropped to the double digits.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:56:06
People want it implemented, and are interested in it on bitcoin after implementation elsewhere.
It is evaluated as being desired, so it is safe to say it is desired. 
Maybe i'm misunderstanding your grievance.
@_date: 2017-05-28 05:23:28
That's the point I was making, no need to be so aggressive if you're just agreeing with me.
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:45:46
I keep seeing that thrown around casually.
This bubble is large enough to become disruptive.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:08:10
Technology before price.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:14:20


The lending rate on polo is so good (3%/2d!), that it would be a loss for me to pull them off during the last 10 days, even entertaining the idea the fork tokens I'd get would have 10% the worth.
@_date: 2017-07-14 21:55:57
It's a cost-benefit analysis really.
It cost more of everyone's time, and effort, to confront these queries than to dispel them with quick compliance.
The emotional, and freedom cost in that situation was certainly worth the expedience and convenience. The decision to accept that trade would be exclusive to that situation and doesn't affect future decisions for your freedom.
Because I comply with requests at an airport doesnt mean I am a sheep.
@_date: 2017-07-03 03:32:47
yea, spam attack or not, the event certainly moved people away from transacting on the bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:40:54
Wasn't aware of that, some quick google does confirm.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:27:45
If a position goes negative/isn't safely covered, it gets called.
@_date: 2017-05-31 04:07:42


what a world to live in when you can trust the developer.
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:17:20
Weak hands regarding buying?
Because weak hands weeks ago are pretty happy.
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:26:33
Can you imagine how great it would be to have a rsk or eth smart contract manage that?
Or heck, even manage quantitatives of modern financial life, like credit, loan approval, etc.
If someone tried to centralize that shit, you'd just launch a different contract that does it free.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:52:23
This feel is so true.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:50:01
This draws a horrible analogy, where the bitcoin protocol is the gas dependent car.
In that situation, you are describing what would be a migration to other technologies, should this one be transacted upon largely.
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:56:55
Malleability is a good example, visa would have a protocol update shoved in weeks/days
@_date: 2017-06-18 23:49:31
It is real, but extremely hard to orchestrate.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:04:25
One off-site ledger, one on my person.
You CAN restore them without the originals.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:51:02
In those contexts, aren't the depicted sentiments correct?
A sharp rise and 80% corrections, looks like 3 bubbles.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:38:57
Didn't the users follow and miners signal the split though? isn't like they forced them to download it.
Seems similar to the uasf stuff.
@_date: 2017-06-04 14:51:06
This would be lucrative to those mining on it though.
@_date: 2017-06-04 04:20:38


u wot.
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:57:57


Yes, but my qualifier of them was their ability to be vilified easily.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:24:39
True that
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:47:12
But why?
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:28:17
Modern socialism constituents are just virtue signalling against an entity that can be vilified to generate homogeneous group thought. Aware of it or not, that is the direction that ideology has moved for those persons.
Edit: enemies such as, The State, The 1%, Nazis.
