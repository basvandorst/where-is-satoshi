Truly how a short works:
I have 1 BTC and I'll lend it to you for a day for the price of .01 BTC.
You take the loan, sell the borrowed BTC immediately at $15k. Price drops tomorrow to $13k. You buy it back and pocket the $2k difference, and I get $130 for lending it to you.
Now obviously, if the price goes up, you're screwed and have to buy back in at a higher price and lose. The longer you borrow, the more interest you have to pay me, so you can't wait for it to crash for too long.

Yeah. If their API is working, their core infrastructure is fine. It's like the automatic door at a grocery store is broken, so everyone who wants to shop has to go in the side door. The store is still open, but you can't get in the normal way. It's just most people don't even know there's a side door and never use it.
I think their main web servers/load balancers are just choking under the load of people looking to panic sell. They probably have separate servers for their API, even though they're both just http servers running ngnix. I've seen this before, it keeps API users from knocking out web users and vice versa.
In theory they do everything in-house (banks with cloud infrastructure is just a legal nightmare) and can't spin up more instances a la AWS to handle the load.

Why does everyone feel regret about spending Bitcoin because the price will increase? Spending Bitcoin is good. More people accepting Bitcoin is better than people just buying Bitcoin as a speculative tool. The first adds actual value to Bitcoin as a currency. Everybody just buying it up to sell it later creates a lot of volatility and bubbles that will burst from over valuation.

Wasn't the fault of Bitcoin. I lost money to the "hack", but I know it was my own fault for using a hosted wallet. If you don't have sole ownership of your private key, you do not have sole ownership of your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-10 05:56:10
I agree. It's kind of a pain to do BTC transactions when you gain or lose a bunch of value overnight.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:57:04
I wouldn't recommend Bitpay. It's at least $300 a month to a company that is likely going to get paid maybe once a year in Bitcoin. Bitpay is great if you have a regular stream of Bitcoin customers. Otherwise you're just tossing money away, and wasting time trying to explain to people wtf a Bitcoin is when they see the "Bitcoin accepted here" signs.

Mining doesn't have to be all about profit.
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:38:01
Here's how it works:
Solo mining: You hash like crazy until you find the solution. If you find the solution by yourself, you get paid the entire reward + fees. You need a shit ton of hashing power to find a block at all. You make more because you don't have to pay a pool fee, but the entry level for solo mining is extremely high, and you can always have bad luck, causing your payouts to be a bit more spastic.
Pooled mining: The pool operator accepts solutions that are "easier" than the required solution, and pays you a smaller amount per solution (aka shares). Eventually one of these solutions will be hard enough to be the solution of the block. You don't get paid extra for solving the block, but you also get paid for not solving the block is the trade-off. The pool operator gets the reward and then pays out to everyone using that reward. There's a fee attached, but you're often getting much more consistent payouts. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:49:26
They'll only talk if you had more than 1 BTC in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:40:17

You're late to the bitcoin mining party. Just spend the money directly on bitcoins, and hope that they go up. You'll buy more than you could ever hope to mine without dedicated mining equipment. 
If your heart is really set on mining, buy some ASICs instead of home-use computers.
But you're mentioning "If I get 10 computers and don't pay for the electricity," it sounds a lot like you're trying to either run a botnet or take over some computers at your school or work or whatever and set them to mining. In which case, piss off.

Obviously, getting a (fireproof) safe for the paper copy and USB stick wouldn't be a bad idea. If the file on Dropbox isn't encrypted, you may have a weak link there, and it may be best to use an email address and password for your dropbox account you've never used elsewhere. Also in that safe, you may want to save any private encryption passphrases there if you plan on keeping them for a long time, because of the very real possibility of forgetting them (considering that these passphrases should be completely unique, as to avoid any possibility of compromised passphrases).

It may be extreme to say "nobody," but most people are just investing and speculating in it. It's really tough to spend and use BTC. I donated to a guy yesterday in BTC, and he was like "That's the first time I've seen a BTC user. Ever." 
It's really rare people are actually using it as a form of currency. A lot of people use it as a medium for exchange akin to the original graph. I'd love to be paid and pay in Bitcoin, but it really hardly ever happens.

That's nice. What does it matter? They can't double-spend without a huge amount of luck with all of their hashing power, and they'd lose more miners even attempting to double-spend than what any possible double-spend would be worth.

Doesn't even need to be in the browser. If they're intercepting your HTTP traffic (easy to do on public wifi, or any kind of shared connection), they can just sniff the HTTP traffic for addresses (anything that starts with 1, has however many characters, and the last 4 characters that make up a checksum fit the bill for the rest of the address), then replace. Perhaps ignore traffic for blockchain.info as to not make every transaction go to the same address, and sooner or later you'll get a bite.

The only "security" these have is that they're less used, more obscure. "Security through obscurity" is total bullshit. If you're not installing every update, you're vulnerable. Why? Every patch is essentially a roadmap of "Fix this, because it was an exploit" that's released to the world. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if bitcoin thieves were targeting Linux because of the amount of Linux servers out there that might be housing large amounts of BTC from mining clusters or online exchanges or hosted wallets.
Windows, yeah, it's easy to get a virus on because it's the most targeted and used by most people. But if you buy Windows (Don't fucking torrent), keep it up to date, and don't do stupid things, you're likely not going to get infected. 
tl;dr: Security is a lot more than picking your OS.
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:04:10
I think it provides an easy method to get bitcoins to those who may not have the means or desire to go through a ton of verification to simply just buy the bitcoins. Perhaps some also expect massive price swings in a while. I mined .07 BTC when I first had the GPU to do so, which was worth about 70 cents when I mined it. I kinda tossed it to the side, but then it was suddenly $7 and then $70 for a short while. I was kind of a hobbyist miner myself, and it was sad I had a laptop when I first heard about Bitcoin, and I wasn't gonna mine with that. 
I mean, I think it's kind of fun to mine. There's the contribution to the network, but maybe someone will see the little erupter and want to know what I'm doing. 
I guess it's kind of hard to explain. Sadly, the poor erupter is weakening with every new generation of ASIC. :(

If you buy (don't fucking torrent) Windows, keep it updated (goes for Linux, too), and keep your stuff together, you should be fine. Linux and Windows both are imperfect when it comes to security, but no OS is. 
Hackers attack Linux all the time to get info from DBs on Linux servers, and they probably use Linux to hack with (not that it's impossible to do on Windows, either). Any security expert will tell you that "security through obscurity" is total bullshit. 
It is easier for the average user to fuck up Windows, sure, but that average user is probably not going to like Linux too much when they can't open their MS Office docs from work at home, or they can't use that one program that was only made for Windows. And if you're going to say Wine, congratulations, you've made .exe viruses able to run on your more "secure" OS. 
I mean, my first virus for a hack-a-thon was for Linux. If a hacker sees a wallet with 100 BTC on an outdated Linux laptop, he's just going to pull out an old exploit that he used to pwn a database from a few months ago, and wait for some delicious coins. 
Also, easy way to do so without compromising the computer: If you are currently intercepting traffic to that computer (e.g. routing all of their packets through your laptop before hitting the default gateway, common MITM technique), simply sniff for HTTP traffic that includes "Bitcoin" and an address, replace addresses with your own. This does not require malware on the computer. It simply requires you to have their *traffic* go to you before hitting the internet. Super easy to do on public Wifi or by conveniently "leaving" your network open to the friendly neighbors. There are plenty of other attacks to fuck with routing tables to get the traffic to you that don't require compromising of the target machine. MITM is powerful stuff. Of course, HTTPS traffic couldn't be replaced as it is encrypted, but I've seen websites that forgot the HTTPS for processing credit cards.
tl;dr: securing your computer is way more than picking your OS.

There is a term called bitcoin days *destroyed*, which attempts to be a better indicator of the volume of bitcoins that are moving around, versus people just sending themselves bitcoins to move from an exchange to a wallet, and then some to their cold storage, etc.
Basically, if I move one bitcoin in a wallet that has been sitting for 24 hours, then I have one bitcoin days destroyed. If I move a bitcoin that has been sitting in a wallet for 100 days, it's 100 bitcoin days destroyed.
The idea is that when there is a BIG spike in bitcoin days destroyed, a very large volume of coins is leaving cold storage and coming back on the market, which implies that there is essentially a greater supply, which lessens the value. 
Sometimes it can be inaccurate, though. For example, if this person found that their paper wallet was on its last legs, they print out a new wallet, and move the coins from their old wallet to their new one. There's still a huge spike in bitcoin days destroyed, but it won't kill the actual value because none of the coins moved are coming to the market.
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:41:43
