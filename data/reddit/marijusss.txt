 put $500,000 into Bitcoin at $600-$630 so I guess that makes me either brave or stupid, considering I've lost 20% of my investment already.
Here's the proof: 1DDWEQM11uMUKiqpGEWvBT2at3CjCw3Vra 
Nevertheless, I am 100% convinced that Bitcoin is heading for $1000 or more in the next few months.  It's always a wild ride in the Bitcoin world.
And if I lose my $500k it's really just a drop in the bucket :-)

Coinbase has security steps in place to prevent this from happening to a user if they protect themselves. You can setup 2-Factor Authentication for Buys/logins/api key creations + Email notifications, I think I read in one blog post that you could even have your coinbase buys go directly to your multisig "coinbase vault" after the waiting period.
Any buys on coinbase over 1000USD are not instantaneous, a 10btc buy on coinbase most likely you can get them too cancel the pending order if you inform them you were hacked and provide details etc. The reason they can cancel it is because it takes multiple days to receive coin values in amounts greater than 1000, also I've heard from people that some banks won't debit coinbase right away with larger purchases so that can add yet another day or two before the funds leave your account. Since all of this waiting for the coins happens before your account ever gains control of the coins you should have enough time to contact coinbase and your bank and get it canceled.
tldr; Worse case scenario in my mind someone does manage to get into your coinbase, they would make a buy for ~999.99 dollars each week you don't notice because it would be instant and they could broadcast a transaction to a wallet they own within seconds.

In my opinion a tourists will be using them in the near future.

1 some people do take small losses on purchases because of the principle
2 Those with the eventual objective of an all bitcoin economy have to initially deal with the reality that while getting to that point it takes time for all the things they need/want to purchase to be available in bitcoin only.
3 During that process a fiat/$ reference allows them to estimate relative value in the existing economy...eventually the reference can be purely bitcoin..but of course if fiat still exists it will always be compared
4 why not?....freedom of choice.. not everyone interested in bitcoin share that principle but many do.
