Completely irrelevant if you use coloured coins as a mean of settlement for fiat, maybe you want to learn a bit more about the blockchain tech before writing hyperbolic, ignorant posts like it's your job

So why should we believe he actually supports Bitcoin rather than just using it as a political platform to drum up support from a community he has identified?
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:51:31
you mean the bag full of money?
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:48:05
Yep, I tried being a "trader" and I've learned my lesson, my coins are safe in cold storage and I just work on other things in the space now. Besides there's lots more money to be made on alt/app coins now. See you in 5 years

Most likely all of the above.  Probably thrown with some ephemeral forms of money in there as well.

Bartering is observed in animals, which proves it is necessarily antecedent to money.

that's interesting, but wasn't the money intercepted as it was sent to btc-e? or am i getting confused with something else?

basically you create tokens on counterpart or coloured coins or master coin or any other similar platform. you make those tokens represent something else, "back" them with fiat through some sort of third party exchange, and you can transact them as if they were the fiat they represent but with the ease and speed of bitcoin

If anything, they would be driving it up... But yes they do have downward pressure on the price which does make btc a rather poor store of value as far as that the current dynamic prevails

Forgive me, what are you talking about?

So what you're saying is that he is an ideologue?
@_date: 2015-04-14 23:40:13
I don't follow the market price 24/7 but from what I've seen, the latest dives seemed to be mainly due to a single whale dumping a bunch of BTC. The books are thin and easily manipulable.

I'm surprised shapeshift.io hasn't yet been pinched in the ribs for facilitating laundering, LE should be all over this
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:46:55
Because it makes it trivial to launder money since there is zero aml/kyc

To me, saying you shouldn't change the money supply (and other so-called ideologies) sounds as clueless as saying you should. Both seem like dogmatic assertions that fail to take context into account. Surely changing it seems like it should be a decision made based on prior evidence and weighing the relevant opportunities and challenges, not some blanket decision you would make based on "ideologies".

It halves the rate of monetary emission, which might be enough for demand to catch up and surpass inflation in terms of impact on the demand/supply wall
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:46:46


Alright then, that's settled... /s
