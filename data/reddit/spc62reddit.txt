They will have definitely already thought of all of these tactics, as they use them on a daily basis in other arenas

Be careful, or you may start a bubble about the bubble of bitcoin bubble threads.

what's the unicode of that B?

Solving a block is very difficult, it is a poisson process so solo mining you could be waiting a very very long time (potentially eternity) waiting to succesfully mine a block.  Joining a pool means whenever another pool member succesfully mines a block, then you get a share of the reward.  BTC guild has too many miners already, and are approaching 51%

Exactly, I wrote this little post when the cyprus run-up was happening, but did not post it.  Now that all of it is happening, here it is.  Look at if from their perspective!

Dude just write a computer time grant proposal to the NSF, make your heist plan sound really sciency, and you're bound to get some time on Blue Waters

You would build a computer and put as many high end graphics cards in it as you can.  There is a bitcoin wiki that tells you the hashing power of each graphics card on the market.  You load mining software onto the computer and join a mining pool (not BTC guild).  Then the mining pool will pay you bitcoins based on the hashing power of your miner. You can plug in your predicted hash rate into an online calculator which will tell you the expected rate of return.  ASICS, which the commenter above is refering to, are backordered), but there are also FPGA which don't have the same hash rate as ASICS but are better than gpus.
