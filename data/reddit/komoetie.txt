I did a quick and dirty calculation using [Coinmarketcap's]( 24-hour exchange volume. I filtered out all trading pairs except for BTC to fiat (e.g. BTC/USD, BTC/ZAR, etc). The results: BTC/ZAR is 9th most traded bitcoin/currency pair! So there is definitely a lot of Bitcoin going around in South Africa :-)

It's not well advertised, but they use Payfast as a payment processor and Payfast support's Bitcoin payments.
Edit: See steps here, won't blame anyone for not finding it:

Thank you, very informative post! Based on a quick and dirty calculation I did yesterday ([here]( you can also add to your list "BTC/ZAR is one of the most traded bitcoin currency pairs". Another interesting graph is that in South Africa has been the top source for bitcoin related Google searches in the last 3 months ([link](
Edit: tl;dr - Our weather and food and people are amazing, bring your Bitcoin startups here!

South Africa (and Cape Town specifically!) seems to be an exciting place to be for Bitcoin and fintech in general!. If you live in South Africa, you could already have just about anything delivered to your doorstep from [Takealot]( and pay using Bitcoin. Just last weekend I paid for my drinks/meal using Bitcoin at [Alexander bar]( And now it seems like I'll be making my weekly grocery trip to this Pick 'n Pay. I wonder if my 25% discount on healthy food will still apply :-)

I bought a Takealot.com voucher earlier today using Luno, bitcoin fee was 0.00002321, around R1.20 (0.07USD?) which is negligible :-)

I know! :-)  Though it _was_ quite big news in 2014 when they first announced it:  Back then "BitX" (now Luno) was still a "Stellenbosch based company"!
