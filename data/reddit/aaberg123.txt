I'm not denying anything, but I'm not putting special importance on Jesus as a historic figure either. The interest revolves around the claims made about him being as a deity, which is also the one of the roots of his popular success. Had no such claim been made, you probably would never have heard about him. Caesars, Pharaohs and viking rulers are interesting irrespective of any divine claims.

When your whole story revolves around an all powerful deity, for which we have zero evidence, every other statement gets tainted.
Look at a Superman comic. Would you use that as a credible source for when Metropolis was founded?

You are completely missing the point.


Yeah, that's the inconsequential and trivial story that nobody would have cared about, *had they also not claimed it was said by the son of god(!)*. Nothing Jesus said was truly new, but a rehash of other philosophies.


I don't. The New Testament does.


Jesus didn't write a single letter in the New Testament. Every single thing said of, or supposedly by, Jesus was written by some else. This makes it irrelevant whether or not Jesus actually claimed to be a deity or not, since we aren't going by the trivialities of the *red letters*, but by the whole packages: The New Testament.


I agree, which renders the New Testament trivial and inconsequential.




As a moral philosopher he's a dime a dozen. He makes some assertions as to how people should treat each other, but not really why. This is where the Bible relied on the authority of a god to work its wonders. He's ***only*** interesting due to the claim that he's the son of a god.
Regarding Superman: My point was that no matter how much the different authors of the Gospels corroborate each other, or other independent text that may verify the existence of a historical Jesus, doesn't lend any credibility to the claim that Jesus was the son of a god.
Just like no matter how many different editions and authors of Superman comics all agree that Metropolis was founded in 1785, does that lend any credibility to the claim that Metropolis is a real city.
TL;DR Whether or not Jesus existed is ***only*** of any importance, whatsoever, if you argue that The New Testament's description of him holds true. Otherwise, it's one of the most futile and irrelevant efforts, ever.

Because you wouldn't believe a comic about Superman to be true, yet people do for the bible, while both have zero real evidence for their statements. That's why.

I find the two terms interrelated.

I don't believe that. You've never caught yourself thinking up a joke when out with friends, but simply not said it because it would be completely inappropriate?
