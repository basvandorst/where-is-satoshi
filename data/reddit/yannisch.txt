Amazon reviews:
Send me a PN for field reports of this information about sending love and transforming reality.
*edit: Love has intelligence too. It designs reality in it's own way.
Okay enough upsetting post for the status quo and 'normal' people here ;)

Start writting down the blockchain on paper xD or print it. But still... xD
@_date: 2015-06-21 10:07:18
ah ok. thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2014-10-18 02:12:03
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:11:56
Yes, makes sence.
@_date: 2014-09-19 07:30:37
Agreed 100%
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:28:20
I send love as described in this book:  "The messenger" (it's free to download/read right there where it says  Read English version)
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:56:05
That's maybe the best answer I'll get and it is a very good one.
But why make the first step in one direction that limits you instead of making the first step in a way where everyone can pay with Bitcoin. After all it isn't that complicated. It may be even more of a hassle to limit Bitcoin than to have it as it is: borderless.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:35:14
PLEASE, could someone changetip him some bits already! All he wants is a satoshi 😄 :D
nevermind, everyone got the same idea
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:42:10
wuff! 
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:46:24
Try circle.com if you got a limit at coinbase. Still a limit but another one ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-10 10:45:18
Bitcoin is Bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:30:36
And maybe part 2 of my method is not to play when I can't send the love.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:54:49
Well jt depends if a service is charging 1% additional for it's - service - to transfer to fiat money. For example to mexican pesos. If you want to support my referal go to mandamundo.com or if not it's just sendbitcoin.mx (as an example they charge 1% for converting n pesos band making it available at a bancomer fiat atm)
The .04 dollars are additional for the sender of a bitcoin or fraction of bitcoin.

Care to explain newsletter? thx!
@_date: 2014-08-24 11:45:44
because of security LOL
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:41:09
I have thought of something similar. System-Data that can't be changed without the private key signing the transaction. A slow but super safe system could be developped on top of this idea.
Basically peer to peer security supported by blockchain tech.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:59:13
I have thought about that.. yes.
Now I start with 0.05 and leave with 0.8+ happened twice in 3 days. didn't loose more than 0.3 in between and that's only because I wasn't sending love then. Summing up I entered with ~0.4 and left with 1.6 betting various times.

hell yeah I like yours - you should read the book @_date: 2014-12-03 22:27:08
and there was another post by me... just 3 days ago. here it is:
that user ( LoveSender-livingonlove_com ) can still be found about 5 times in the rare wins stats of the last 7 days
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:41:04
I'm sorry to hear that and at the same time, thanks for the story I guess. I will stop it now with gambling. See the other comments. If you like to improve your life with something as easy as sending love go read the book. It's free and something else than gamble. All the best on your way
@_date: 2014-12-04 05:37:52
Thanks! I'll invest my luck into other things now :)
The book mentioned is still a good read and free.
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:25:15
not sure why you get downvotes...
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:40:58

Maybe he's being blackmailed into doing this. It's not that hard to find him.

He can do whatever he wants. At least I hope so.

If Bitcoin wallets fall under Art 3. you might be right but if it's a product then I could have been correct with my statement.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:39:34
I will stay away now. After all it's a good time to quit at ~1.2 btc+
Thank you for your comment. It sounds true.
I will now try to make bitcoins with something else :)
@_date: 2014-09-21 08:05:23
All of the sudden 2 out of 10 would not bang becomes a completely different meaning...

@_date: 2014-11-12 20:10:37
Maybe in some places they don't care about Bitcoin or bits even if it's cool.
I like Bitcoin. My uncle and aunt were quite interested once I made a 22$ dollar donation over bitcoin to these guys:
(disclaimer: they convert to another currency)
There are people like my aunt and uncle that stand in awe when they realize that it took 2 seconds to transfer value to people that need it most. 
And not 2 days or 2 weeks.
PART 2:
A charity could donate a QR code or address 'enablement' tied to a geolocation or another condition such as 'if people are in need then they have a certain address'? Maybe then a village could survive easier because someone could help them. The helper would know who they are helping!
tldr: the ones that help would know that they are helping the ones who need it. Reducing corruption.

@_date: 2015-05-31 20:42:07
I am technical but not that much. I've got a question 
What if blocks were 100GB (huge number, doesn't matter how huge). How could we (read: you core dev people :)) behaviour-code bitcoin the protocol so that every node of the network (node as in device) works fine regardless of speed connections?
Just trying to soften the discussion a bit and give input.
And another inspiration I just had: what about making dynamic 'zones' in which addresses that exchange value more often are somehow generated closer together? Like a code that is win/win for everyone if they choose if they are a mergant, frequent spenders or high balance spenders or both or an exchange or whatever and optimized in that way. It would have the requirement to be 'neutral' against discrimmination. Win win as I said.
That's all, going to sleep now and thank you and all the devs out there giving their focus on good things. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 12:19:21
Thanks for the help! 
It makes much more sense now.

@_date: 2014-09-27 12:20:25
Yes. I had the feeling that something was odd but couldn't put my finger on it so I asked Reddit. Thanks!

I like the way you look at things.

Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2014-12-19 06:00:25
Have used it as well amd can only give positive feedback. One thing I found suspicious though is their referal program. I refered over 250 views with mandamundo.com as a referal domain but no one seems to have used it? Anyway it was a good service to send money to my family.

If in europe kraken.com is quite a nice choice!
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:39:49
Yes, I think so too. Maybe with more research it could be used otherwise though. Booting Systems with private keys, ...
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:37:39
Prepare and show a transaction. Maybe with a huge public key QR code, pay with your smartphone and track the address with Blockchain.info.
Then ask your audience if anyone already has a Bitcoin Wallet on their phone.
Next display the private key QR code of the transaction. 
Let it be 5 Swiss Francs e.g.
Say that everyone without a wallet already on their phone should compete against each other for who scans / imports the private key first.
Funny thing is that several people will pass around the Bitcoins (I think) unless they transfer to their own hidden private key.
At the end let the winner donate the money to a good cause such as google thewaterproject.org donate bitcoin.
Take what you like :)
Have an awesome presentation. Bonne chance from Lucerne!
