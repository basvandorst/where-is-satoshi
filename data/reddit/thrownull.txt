Every educated person should realize that too;
Tax on income are most unfair. 
Tax on land, or better just "the rent" and "the bill for utilities" is what responsible adults want to pay - so they should pay that instead sponsoring evil thugs like governments.

@_date: 2014-05-26 14:09:13
Incorrect, they want to limit state intervention and influence/power, living the power for local organisations, NGOs, people etc.
They want to cut down taxation a lot or remove it - this already is important.
If they say each person can do what he wants, buy gun, open shop with LSD, work without minimal-wage, drive without seat-belts etc, why should they at all regulate some virtual points, surly they will not want to limit that.

or try some risky new idea like old timers from bitcoin?
What is this communist crap.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:56:37
You are right in saying that it is different thing,
and yes - In some ways it is indeed a less of horribly idea then minimal-wage.
But in others it is even worse (you get money even without trying to work AT ALL).
So, no thanks.
It's time to remove communism, not embrace more of it. (Or at least allow people like me to keep states and it's fucking "protection" away from me).
@_date: 2014-07-03 07:55:28

@_date: 2014-08-13 15:14:42
This is total and utter bullshit.
If I can hire 2 young Negroes for 2000 or 1 White guy for 4500 (assuming they have similar experience/skill) I will go for the Negroes and give them chance to learn and all.
If you set min wage for 2500, I will obviously prefer 4500 then 2*2500=5000.
If you will rise tax, I will avoid it or maybe lower price for employees, or at worse e.g. buy worse car.
The poor people will have serious problems.
But it all boils to question, who should spend your money?
You, or some other guy? I say that you.

Why should I pay someone for doing nothing (the money comes from somewhere, certainly not from pockets of politicians).
People should move own ass and get to work.
Basic income is damn socialistic/communistic idea. We have too much of communism already, no thanks;

It is the not-intrusive censorship, "you can not say that - on my property" more or less.
Of course that is far less bad then intrusive censorship of democracy "if you say that thing that scared masses are afraid of we will arrest you, ANYWHERE"

Assholes. We should keep asking imo. As the community, and warn other people to not turst Google / Chrome.
Just in case someone would some day for some reason also "disappear" this COMMENT you made:
 Mike H • 5 hours ago Featured by CoinDesk
Let me explain what most likely happened here (I don't know for sure because I don't work for Google any more).
Google systems are programmed to hide content from accounts that are terminated. The reason is that accounts are typically terminated ("disabled" in Google parlance) because they have been spamming, like by uploading scammy YouTube videos or sending spam from Gmail, or posting spam blogs and so on. Once identified as bad, all the content associated with the account is also assumed to be bad.
Google has many automated systems that are designed to hunt down and terminate fake accounts. I wrote some of them myself. Sometimes they are so sure they do it immediately, but most often they decide to probe an account by logging the user out and requiring them to pass a CAPTCHA or phone verification before they can log back in. Once an account is put into this mode, a timer is started. If the account doesn't pass the "proof-of-humanity" type challenge within the time limit (often e.g. a month but it can vary) then it's assumed that the spambot which was using the account got stuck and can't pass the test, thus the account is bad and therefore it is moved up to full termination.
Unfortunately once an account is put into CAPTCHA/SMS verify state, no emails are sent (because users can't tell them apart from phishing). So if you aren't logging in to the account semi-regularly you may not notice the account is pending CAPTCHA/SMS. This often happens when people create dedicated Google accounts just for uploading a specific piece of content. Because the account has no activity and only uploaded content, but doesn't actually use any products, it looks a lot like a spammer account. Then it gets CAPTCHAd/SMSd and eventually terminated, the content it was hosting disappears, and this is the first time the real owner sees that anything was wrong. Then there's usually a manual appeal which is reviewed by the support team and the account gets reinstated after an inspection.
In this case, the Chrome Store is probably programmed to remotely uninstall extensions created by terminated accounts, because the usual assumption is it's better to remove users from harms way and let the manual investigations mop up the occasional false positive.
The solution is to not upload content to Google using one time accounts, if at all possible. Use your personal account that has real usage and activity, and where you'll notice if Google is trying to contact you through the web UI.

Lol. Not me, it's what the market assumed, and the mechanism here is historical example of situation from USA when one of the presidents rised the min-wage. 
He in fact admitted it was done to make life harder for various immigrants or ethnic groups, because they were often (of course not always!) the group of employees that we perceived as worse.
You can google or wikipedia all the details on this easily.
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:52:47
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:10:19
And many more. Excellent! :)
This is the list of things that I can finally have a bit of competition instead of state super monopoly and no accountability!
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:41:33
This mechanism was very visible in the afair 1920's (check Wikipedia as I written in other comment), but the mechanism is universal, in many businesses you will have a lower income as certain group, or as immigrant. 
When min wage is higher then what people are willing to pay for work of these employees, then either business is run as charity by altruistic owner who keeps making loses just to let some people earn more then what they make for him...
or, they get fired.

Don't ever trust your government (unless they promise to tax the citizens, e.g. they promise to give some "free" things to everyone - then it's true, well at least for the taking money first part)

Of course it is, just keep it, not give it out to some other person/company.
Keep it on paper, or in brain wallet.
Use own, secure computer.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:49:44
If you keep your bitcoin in your paper wallet or brain wallet, then no one can steal them. If you give them out to other entity and they are hacked, well of course.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:22:49
You keep it offline when not using it - like in a safe.
When you want to spend it, you take some amount and use it online.
Like with a wallet and an armored safe box at home.
If you keep 100000$ in wallet, instead 500$ in wallet when you go shopping, then don't whine you can get mugged, it is not fault of fiat that you are mugged that way.
But with fiat like USD, you are always a bit "robbed" by inflation that is a other people will decide in not-transparent way.

This video has many errors.
It keeps using "European Countries" and "European Union Countries" as it's the same thing.
Many citizens of European countries are against European Union because it brings over-regulation, kills free market, brings socialism/communism.
Many of us are for Free trade in Europea, but not for European Union.
ON some maps it was showing Poland as part of Euro-Zone; While you can spend Euro in many places in Poland as option, the official currency is Polish PLN.

This could be the case now in Poland when paid for services in BTC: first you pay VAT because you sold a service, and then VAT on exchanging bitcoin to PLN.
All depends on interpretation. There is no clear law.
