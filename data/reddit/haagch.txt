Heh, I've been in contact with someone there about some VR project on Linux. Definitely cool, but do they need donations, given that it's a company created by Elon Musk?

Many important causes already. Definitely I'm seconding FSF or here in europe FSFE and OpenStreetMap.
Close to my heart is VR on a free software stack. VR is going to be an important technology for the future and currently if you want to do almost anything with VR on PCs, you need a proprietary stack like, windows, Oculus SDK or SteamVR, Unity or Unreal Engine. Far too few people care, but for the future we absolutely need a free software stack.
A project with some buzz behind it already is godot engine, of course open source, heavily improving their 3D support for the next release and also working hard on VR support. 
OpenHMD is reverse engineering HMDs and other VR hardware and writing open source drivers for it. They have a bitcoin donation link, but better check with them before sending a larger sum.  It's a relatively small project, but there are people who are part of Khronos' OpenXR group around. If you want open source lighthouse positional tracking and use it  either directly with the OpenHMD API [or even in SteamVR, you can soon do that]( thanks to the OpenHMD reverse engineering.

They're saying: It's fast enough. Not that there is any real support from AAA developers.
They're more advertising to game **developers** with a demo of Unreal Engine 4:

It's always possible it will gain hugely in value, but let's be honest, if you look at a graph like  there is also a high chance that this will not last for very long.
That's not to say not to invest. Overall bitcoin has gained value quite consistently over longer periods of time. But right now seems one of these bubbles that will go back to a more reasonable price soon.
