There has been a strong argument for eliminating ir severly limiting the supply of $100 USD bills for a while now as it would make black markets much more difficult to sustain and most consumers don't require the $100 bill on a constant basis. Most done fine with the $50 or even the $20. However doubling or even quintupling the amount of space needed to transport millions of dollars would cause a much bigger headache for criminals.

This is the pool that your "rewards" card tends to pull from. Businesses usually respond by charging more if you use a card because of this. So if you use your card for everything, then your rewards are really just a ludicrous cycle of your money you've already payed going back to you.l again.

Didn’t Ulbricht also order a contract killing against someone who double crossed him?
