Andreas is an absolute legend and this was a great read. Thanks for sharing.

Yes, I can't wait to find out how they will help secure our interests. Bitcoin will no doubt corrupt our youth if they don't step in to save us.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:05:27
LMFAO! This is gold.
Dude has great balancing skills though. Will make a great HODLer.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:00:02
Yes, Waltonchain is an amazing project and looks poised to succeed regardless of what Bitcoin or Ethereum do in the future due to its adoption by real world businesses where it will save them enormous amounts in cost saving efficiencies. Keep an eye on WTC - it will be doing A LOT of growing this year.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:20:12
I like Tom Lee.
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:04:25
Ouch. So this is why you should switch off your rig when you go on vacation?
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:08:33
I like it. I like it a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:56:30
Yeah, like just $1 million. Just to check.
@_date: 2018-01-15 12:39:25
Moving YOUR hard earned money around in the "free world" is a joke these days.
It's sad that ordinary people feel like they may encounter problems or even feel criminalized when they choose to move THEIR money to or from an exchange.
THIS is why we need crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:31:13
"But you know what’s more popular than stable monetary instruments? Casinos!"
Author of the article obviously still doesn't get it as they are saying that people are investing in Bitcoin because they love to gamble.
Do some proper research, watch some Antonopolous videos and it'll quickly feel like a whole lot less of a gamble.
The real gamble is keeping your savings in fiat and not buying any Bitcoin.

When people talk about Bitcoin and bubbles they are looking in the wrong place. They should be looking at the humongous fiat bubble that is leaking... leaking into the vacuum outside that is Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It is transfer that is going to be virtually impossible to stop
and the leak has barely begun.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:12:41
Well put. For starters I think Japan recognises this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:10:06
Haha! This is golden.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:36:19
Until you encounter the dreaded KYC with Bitstamp and then they ignore you for weeks on end. Otherwise they're great.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:36:59
48% Gold / 52% Bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:29:33
No, "just" 21 bitcoin. No more than 1 million people can theoretically own 21 or more bitcoin so it's an exclusive club!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:48:46
?? But he can now short it without putting money into it using futures. Have you been living under a rock? I could say "idiot" but that would be childish, eh?
You know it's not too late to jump onboard, BTC is still in its infancy and you don't have to buy a whole one ;) Invest now, enjoy the free money and then later you can find out that the technology behind it will change the world (for the better). Do yourself a favour and go watch some Andreas Antonopolous videos. No need to thank me later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:40:08
That might actually destroy the moon though! Now we're going to Mars!
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:30:16
I wish the BBC would get Andreas on. Even the so called experts on there are completely clueless.
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:13:37
Yes, there certainly is that element but for those that are well read on the subject it isn't really a gamble, more of a hedge and diversification.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:22:51
Because the questions can be difficult to answer, your account then gets put on hold (potentially for weeks or closed altogether) while it's reviewed and you cannot reply to the open ticket without putting it to the back of the queue. KYC can cost you a small fortune in a rapidly rising market. Also, you cannot supply the information in advance and you're not allowed to know what the invisible thresholds are that trigger further KYC. Try googling people's experiences with it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:30
You just won the Internet. Haha, that was awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:07:38
Has anyone tried to work out how much money Venezuela might pump into Bitcoin/alts in the near future? I guess it's difficult to work out/predict when their currency is hyper-inflating.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:13:39
ABSOLUTE LIVING LEGEND
Unbelievably intelligent and able to articulate essential information in a concise and engaging way.
Every newcomer should watch as many of his talks as they possibly can. Scratch that, everybody should watch them.
Thank you, Andreas!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:56:11
Unless you're a whale, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:05:18
This could be related to the random phonebook name theory.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:22:45
This would also make the Bitcoin market cap similar to that of gold... interesting!
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:19:21
So $47,619.04761904762 per BTC? Sounds about right by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:55:14
Great article, thanks. The future is bright!
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:12:19
He has explained that when he first learned of Bitcoin and blockchain technology it blew his mind and the obsession with it utterly consumed him to the point that he forgot to eat and sleep.
He has an amazing ability to model, in his mind, how an emerging technology will impact the world. He is like an oracle when it comes to futurology (is that even a word, lol?). He recognised what impact the Internet could have way back in 1989/1990 when 99.99999999% of people had absolutely no idea.
Whenever he speaks, we would all be wise to listen very carefully.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:08:17
And maybe if it is Hal and Nick they chose to use a multisig wallet or simply split their seed between them which is why it's never been used. That would mean Hal's kids now have access to his part.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:30
Maybe he got confused with Monero??
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:00
This! When the whales start selling, just watch an Andreas video.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:07:49
The first Bitcoin billionaires? Erm, I highly doubt that.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:30:53
Why's that?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:43:45
Deposits at Bitstamp can take weeks at the moment - they seem to be very understaffed. Though I'm sure the same can be said for most exchanges at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:14:13
I don't see why it can't eclipse the precious metal market cap and after that anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:08
This. Cash out profits and buy Bitcoin with it separately and keep it in a hardware wallet. It's most certainly not safe otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:23
What a ride!
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:12
HODL and you'll be fine ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:09:30
Maybe just nominate Nick Szabo...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:51
So you had 33 BTC and don't understand the fundamentals of how Bitcoin works? Seriously? And now that you sold, you're spreading FUD so you can buy back cheaper? Something doesn't add up - I don't buy that you're ignorant or stupid enough to not know how Bitcoin works. So when are you buying back in?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:07:11
He's done it. He's broken through the psychological barrier of 20k and is now at 21,593. I think this is bullish.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:27:59
Yes. It's certainly wise to diversify in order to hedge against a potential fiat (dollar) collapse and Bitcoin is currently still an extremely good choice amongst other things (land, property, precious metals etc).
One thing is guaranteed and that is that fiat money will always be worth less tomorrow,
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:21:00
It would make sense for them to use a child chain of an existing blockchain, like Freyr on Waltonchain.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:45:52
Could be worse, it could be Facebook.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:26:28
Really? I missed that.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:35:18
Cool, cheers.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:05:42
Haha, this is gold :D
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:50:58
I have no words. Keep drinking the koolaid.
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:56:13
Surprisingly this is the first time I've ever seen/heard Elon Musk speak. Was surprised to see him tear up like that - normally people in his position seem super hardened and don't show emotional responses in public situations.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:54:40
But if fiat starts to fail it can lead to hyperinflation so the numbers could get really crazy without BTC really changing too much in what it could actually buy outside of dollars, i.e. a loaf of bread.
