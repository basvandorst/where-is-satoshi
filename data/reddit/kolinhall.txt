I am 100% behind core but in this case I think it creates more confusion rather than helps. Now we'll end up with trolls here talking about a split in core where one developer has decided to go his own way. Even if that is NOT what it is, the trolls and news media looking for new click bait blow everything out of proportion and have no interest in reporting the truth.  Better to not have this project than to have it.

Very good overview.  Thank you for posting this. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 14:45:59
Do you have a Facebook page, blog post, twitter history. If not then I assume your not too serious about getting anywhere. 
I clicked on your web page and it took long to download. All I saw was a progress bar and that didn't inspire any confidence.  For all I know it could be downloading something to my PC. If you're serious about the app and getting help I suggest you stop development and put energy into making people aware what you are doing first.  Once that's all done then go back, rework the front-page to at least not show a white screen with a progress bar.  Hope my suggestion helps.  Just trying to give you some advice if you want to get ahead. 
If you want to see marketing at work.  Check out Yours on twitter.  Very frequent postings or check out Brave Browser where it gives good information on the development timeline. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 08:27:28
Basically you've been unsure and unhappy about everything new that's come out over the last year.  It's kind of depressing reading your posts. If you're that unsure about things then why not go join the r/btc guys or join the Bitcoin Unlimited loonies.

@_date: 2016-08-20 06:40:19
I do daily buys and 99% of the time they have been okay for me over the last year.  I was pissed of for a few days when they asked me to reverify once but after an email to support all was okay again (took a few days).  Other than that nothing I can think of to complain about.  The service has done exactly what I needed and continues to work okay. Shame they increased they fees though. I guess that's not a good thing and maybe there are cheaper alternatives.
@_date: 2016-08-19 00:29:55
I moved btc from Coinbase to Trezor a few times today and all seemed normal.  What time did you experience the problems.  Mine were first confirmed in what seemed like less than 10 minutes.

These guys were saying it would grind to a halt with 1mb almost one year ago. Seems to be still going strong and segwit should add a lot more space in the next couple of months.  Would you prefer a fork like Ethereum did?  
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:48:01
Very probably. About time people started asking more questions.  You don't just lose $63 million to hackers without being some of the dumbest people in the world.

"We engaged Ledger Labs in the hours immediately after the attack happened" 
Can you clarify if this is the first time you have mentioned this? As there have probably been many hundred messages from your company I'm sure many of those make mention of the company you hired to look into the problem. 
It's been a couple of weeks and so far I think you have forgotten to mention which authorities you have contacted. Surprised you've not mentioned this in the post but perhaps something you forgot to add. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 04:33:16
Stop knocking the guy.  He never said it was profitable.  He does not talk about performance and if it does one single hash then it's infinitely more than anyone else has done. Given the opportunity I would love to get involved with something like this even if it never returned a single cent. Multiple here have said "this is stupid".  I would say that those people are stupid to make the assumption that this was done for financial return.  There are some people in the world who do things so they can say they are the first to have done something.

Trevor.   But Ledger's looking good these days.  No new products out from Trezor for quite some time.   Part of that's because there's no need for anything as Trezor works good. But a lower cost alternative from Trezor would be a good thing I think.

He seems to focus on what is best for him / his business interests and not on what his best for the community.

Good to see a blog. Do you have a twitter feed.  Not trying to be a troll here and I'm just trying to help.

So many scam artists on blockchain looking to get btc coins. Be very careful what you invest in.  Watch this guy try to wiggle out of answering questions about what he's doing with his crowdfunding coins.  Also listen to him try to claim his new company has no connection to his old failed company.  Pretty boring video but he around the 30 minute mark onwards the interviewer starts to ask questions and he tries hard to change the topic. Would you send your bitcoins to a private individual, with a history of failed scams, who does a podcast from his bedroom and refuses to use and escrow. 
@_date: 2016-08-20 16:32:41
This appears to be big news. There's also an option to just send btc from your wallet without needing coin base.

You're joking, right?
@_date: 2016-08-20 10:36:53
Just like there's a web site for Bitcoin obituaries maybe there should be a similar site naming those who have done the most harm to bitcoin.  I can think of quite a few names of people who have put their own financial interests ahead of everything at the expense of bitcoin. Luckily there are still many hundreds of people who are dedicated to helping bitcoin but sadly they don't have the means to run PR campaigns as much as the Bitcoin hurters do.

So where would you suggest we put our money?  My bitcoins have increased almost 100% in value while the money in my bank has gone up 0.5% or something like that.  Not really sure of the bank rate any more as I don't look at it because it's so low. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 18:08:31
Good try but no it was not promised. The estimate for 0.13 was September 1 when I just looked at the schedule.

I'm sure others will give interesting answers but I think only 1 in 5,000 or less people who "try bitcoin for the first time" would think to use a bitcoin core wallet.  Your choice when there are many others and when you are just starting and moving coins before the wallet is even set up sounds very interesting . Why did you make that choice?

If you want to get anywhere with your app the do a blog, update the blog at least every 2-3 weeks and promote, promote, promote.  Then if you have spare time add features. So many companies these days do all the dev and zero marketing. Bitcoin core would be a great example of that.

No need for bitfinex to reply to anything any more. The gullible customers believed everything they were told. The scam's over and Bitfinex have their money and more coins than they know what to do with.  Now I'm wondering what they will do with all the bitcoins they said were hacked.  My guess is they will leave them for a long time until their exploit is over and new mixing tools are put in place.  A nice nest egg for bitfinex guys retirement.  
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:10:51
Sounds like it.  Your original coinbase account was probably just fine but then you logged into a fake web site, gave them your login details and password.  The hackers will then use that information to go into your real coinbase account.  But if you are using 2FA I think it's not possible. So were you using 2FA ?
@_date: 2016-08-28 08:31:36
I was just waiting to see the usual FUD and sure enough it's all there.

I am sure a lot of technical work has gone into this but the web site the name "Bitcoin Knots" and the logo you created for this looks and sounds like something from 20 years ago and doesn't leave a good first impression :-(  Just check out the first posts here saying "wtf is this shit" and "lol a clone of bitcoin core".  That's the impression I think many less technical people are going to have when they see this. Needs a good name other than Knots and even a different version name from v0.13.0.knots20160814. It really does not sound professional and in this field marketing your solution may be more important than what the solution actually contains. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 04:35:09

Amazing job but it will go unnoticed if you don't market what you have done for the masses.  Time and time again I see great things created but nobody knows about them, documentation is lacking and there's no good instructions, tutorials, videos, examples on how  a person who has only very basic knowledge can use the software.  I suspect this product will never get anywhere for the simple reason that it won't be marketed and 99.9% of people will know nothing about it or have any chance of using it :-(   Sorry to be doom and gloom but that's just the way I see it.  If you want to get anywhere with this spend a significant amount of time on documenting and making the product known to everyone.  If you don't do that then ALL your work will be wasted.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:13:58

As a person who's been following bitcoin on and off for 3-4 years it looks to me like the amount of work now being done on protocol development is many times more than a couple of years ago.  There are no lazy developers working on bitcoin and of course they are conservative as security of the network is absolutely critical with a protocol like bitcoin.

But consolidation that maintains the price to within 0.0002%? You know I checked earlier and the price was 6400.000.   Can't get much closer to 6,400 than that and it seems to be stuck to that point almost every time I check.

You should learn about what you are putting your money into.  If you do consider investing then a small amount every week with a view to holding it for a long time is a great way to start.  Take things slowly, don't fall for all the scams, buy from a real exchange.  This world is 99% scams and I personally believe that Bitcoin is one of the few things left in the world that's not a scam.  But research for yourself.  Watch some videos by  this  guy:

Sorry I should have been more accurate.  A blockchain is nothing more than a linked list that can be securely updated by multiple parties which luckily happens to be perfectly suited to the needs of Bitcoin.  If you want to check out more about databases I would suggest you spend time reviewing the current state of databases that have been under development and continuous improvement now for almost the last 40 years by companies like Oracle and its 138,000 employees.

For anyone that doubts it didn't happen then yeah it did.  I checked my bank statement online years ago and found another account had been created and that someone who I assumed was an identity thief had moved money from my other account into it. I was very worried. Now I thought a person has access to all my bank details.  I called up Wells Fargo and they said they had no idea who opened the account. I closed all my accounts, reopened, changed passwords, moved money back.  Lots of stress for a long time. 
Only years later did I realized it was the bank that committed the fraud against me !

That's right. I had about ten thousand in one account so they opened a new account without me asking and then moved about five thousand dollars to that new account. This was a few years ago.  By now I'm sure everyone has forgotten about it and nobody has been charged with any crime.

Breaking backwards compatibility?  Who's the source of this BIP?
@_date: 2016-09-22 16:06:05
Brian just cannot seem to get it right.  Every time he announces an Ethereum success then something bad happens to them. Here's the news from the Ethereum reddit just now:
URGENT ALL MINERS: The network is under attack. The attack is a computational DDoS, ie. miners and nodes need to spend a very long time processing some blocks. This is due to the EXTCODESIZE opcode, which has a fairly low gasprice but which requires nodes to read state information from disk; the attack transactions are calling this opcode roughly 50,000 times per block. The consequence of this is that the network is greatly slowing down, but there is NO consensus failure or memory overload. We have currently identified several routes for a more sustainable medium-term fix and have developers working on implementation.
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:17:12

With Bitmain's history of lying it's hard to believe that it's really going to ship on those dates when they don't yet know (for sure) it's specification.

Just more lies from Bitmain hoping the new units will convince IPO investors again.

The losses may have been small. In my case it was just that they opened a new account under my name and then moved half my money from one account into it.  I was freaked out for a week or longer as they told me they didn't know who did it.

Never got a good answer from them and never knew why it happened until this week. '

Yeah Ethereum is good at forking.  Start off with one and now they have two Ethereums.  Then later on when they do the next fork for POS there will be 3-4 forks.

You don't seem aware that eth is almost integrated everywhere and this is where all the new blockchain project are migrating including a lot of big names. The darkweb have integrated monero which is why it's value has skyrocketed. Bitcoin is slowly making itself irrelevant due to awkward economic incentives AKA Gregonomics. I don't know where the market will go but I'm keeping a close eye on it, what I do know is with the current market conditions there is no reason for this trend to change."
eth is almost integrated everywhere !
The channel is just full of pumpers trying to pump alternate currencies and I don't think anyone in their right mind who supports bitcoin hangs out there.  Just pumpers talking to pumpers, pumping or trying to find faults with bitcoin.

A compulsive liar is defined as someone who lies out of habit. Lying is their normal and reflexive way of responding to questions. Compulsive liars bend the truth about everything, large and small. For a compulsive liar, telling the truth is very awkward and uncomfortable while lying feels right.

Happened to me. Check my accounts one day and there was a new account that had been created with money moved out of another account and into it.  I though some kind of identity theft at the time.  Now I know who did it, the bank employees!

It's very easy to be banned from r/btc.  Create a new account.  Pick a thread that is even slightly controversial and suggest that what is being done is not in the best interest of bitcoin.  I tried this a couple of month ago wiht a new username and was banned after 3-4 replies I made to posters on a thread supporting bigger blocks.  I am guessing they saw I was a new user and that was a big flag for them. Thankfully Roger usually keeps a low profile on the slack channels except for today when he appears to have been back to his old self.   Think I'll hop over there right now and see if I can get my account banned just for the fun of it

Interesting that this appears on the altcointoday web site.  I wonder if that's a Roger supported site.  Anyway his quote is like saying "let's jump off a cliff to see if it kills us because if we don't do it we'll never know".  This guy Roger needs to stop trying to destroy bitcoin and get a real job helping in a positive fashion.
@_date: 2016-09-19 05:53:19
Is this related to your we need bigger blocksize posts that you keep making? I assume that's where you're trying to direct this thread too.  You may have more success on r/btc with the big blocksize posters there.  People here learned a long time ago that bigger does not mean better and there are better upcoming solutions. 
@_date: 2016-09-25 08:20:55
Alt coins are not discussed here and that's about it.  Don't play the "this forum is censored" game like Rodger. Well maybe you are Rodger in which case there's no place for your silly mod policies blah blah.   If you create a forum then you can set your own rules so go create your own.

2-3 months testing sounds rather long as there will be nothing to test if segwit is not yet activated. In the past the rc1, rc2 &gt; production has been in the order of 1-2 weeks recently. I am hoping activation period could start mid to end of October. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:54:23
Well for sure they are NOT anticipating the end of bitcoin.

I certainly agree with this.  For over 1 1/2 years now they have been forecasting doom and gloom and questioning why ever coffee cup purchase cannot go on the block chain.  Got to the point now where I wonder what the agenda is.  Either these guys are fools or they are (my suspicion) alt coin guys who want to push bitcoin to the sidelines so they can increase the price of their alts. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:31:55


Do you have any documentation on how we can run a liquid side chain full node?  Not saying you are guilty of this but I see so many projects where the developers spend thousands of hours developing and then the projects fail because the documentation is not good and people don't know how to use what the guy developed.

Did you look at the milestones and see what is left? Also a lot of chatter on the slack channels which I follow every day. It's a "guess" but hopefully not far off based on what I have observed.  I'm welcome to hearing from others on how long they think it will be.
@_date: 2016-09-23 05:19:41
Which Ethereum are you talking about.  I'm confused as there's ETH and ETC.  Well I guess you mean ETC as that's the true Ethereum but that's a bit odd as most developers seem to support ETH which is the one they were able to fork to get their money back after the first attack.  So confusing to me.

@_date: 2016-09-24 05:52:02
Have you checked the milestones and tasks remaining:
My guess would be more like 5-10 days for rc1 but core devs could I am sure give a better estimate. However 5 years seems like about 4 years and 10 months incorrect.

Very impressive but does this not require Segwit to be deployed? The way that Ryan is adding to confusion by pushing and complaining about block size and the need for forks we'll never have segwit as we won't get the needed 95% for activation.
