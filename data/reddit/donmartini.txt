Segwit is not required for lightning 
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:54:00
There is a temp solution that would make the system usable, I  know block size is not a complete solution but it would help right now.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:33:15
Bit isn't everyone saying bitcoin is digital gold. It's working as it should. Difficult and expensive to move. Now everyone is complaining.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:56:42
Debatable since they have more transactions in a block and therefore even though the fee is lower they will get a lot more of them
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:17:57
How much does it cost to open the channel? Also what happens if the other party closes the channel?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:47:03
Do you think a 2MB blocksize will make bitcoin not decentralized? It would sure help with the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:23:27
If I don't pay the high fee and pay, say only a $7 fee. I won't get in the next block, it's still expensive, and still slow. $7 is expensive for a transaction.

Hey, the exchange I experienced lag with was bittrex. Fair play for the reply. Nice to know you guys are active and engaging with the community.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:37:47
Lightning will need a block size increase anyway so they should just go ahead and move to 2mb now and save us a lot on fees
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:16:49
Old non segwit version though. You need to update it manually
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:30:36
Neither are happening right now though. Segwit adoption is painfully slow, at only 8% now, it's going down instead of up, and schnorr is when?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:12:08
Pumping my altcoin, ha, good one. I am not married to either coin, I hold both. However it can't be denied that bitcoin is now difficult to move. And by difficult I mean expensive and slow. Just like gold.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:44:55
Because you said right now. Tesla wasn't running for 7 years and then started having battery problems. If they did then the situation would have been very different. Bitcoin was working for 7 years, the last 2 it has not been 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:54:26
Well since we dont even have a Monaco card out yet then how could they be affected
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:05:46
The problem with fees is that they are too high. At least the dogshit works
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:13:47


except one is barely adopted and the other is not available to use yet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:18


Bitcoin is a store of value by force, not by choice of the users.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:43:10


The CEO has said its not a priority because nobody has asked for it. That completely kills that theory

This is a stupid statement to make. Day trading is a good way to increase your stack without putting new fiat in. Some real advice would be good here. If you are a beginner and want to day trade then make sure you read all the information you can about it. Buy some books and watch some videos before getting started. Learn about risk management and reward/risk ratio. Don't risk more than 1% of your account on a trade. Pick a pair, btc/eth for example and build a sample of 50+ trades for your strategy. Read read read and read. Don't go in a trade just because, you need to pick good trades where the odds are in your favour. Set your stop losses based on support and resistance levels.

There is a noticeable lag on coinigy and can cause you you miss buys and sells. Best option, have 2 monitors, trading view open on one and your exchange open in the other.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:38:52
That is wayyyyy too high. Post the tx here!
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:12:25


Show me a coin with 1gb blocks


This has been going on for at least 3 years now, not just this year.


Bitcoin doesnt have that long, it needs to sort its problems out fast. The end of 2018 will not be good enough.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:59:58


But by this time your competitors will have taken all your business. Bitcoin is suffering by not sorting this problem on a temp basis until the longer term solution is available.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:50:01
How do you know? Fees have gone up 10000% in just a year. At some point people will stop using it because the fees are so damn high. That time will come very soon unless something is done to change that, and fast.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:00:57
The value doesn't matter. Only the percentage moves
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:29:06
Those are fees for using the network. The wallet you are using doesnt take those fees its the miners. The simple fact is that bitcoin is very expensive to use right now. Transaction costs are too high for sending small sums of money. Hopefully these problems will be fixed soon and there are already things in place which do help this(segwit) but adoption from exchanges and wallets has been way too slow. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:11:35
You think an increase to 2MB will affect the dencentralization? No it wouldn't, even 4 or 8mb wouldnt. But it would help a lot with the problem of fees until Layer 2 is ready
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:36:39


Yea, you.
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:51:40
And bitcoin is sold for what? Potatoes???
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:52:39
 smacking yourself for keeping coins on coinbase ever
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:51:18
Why would you keep your coins on coinbase anyway?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:30:34
You could print a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:52:07
Yea at 20% mark down
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:26:52
Very little support, the blocks have very little transactions in them. I could find a lot of shitcoins that do more transactions than Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:01:17
I thought segwit will stop asic boost?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:37:28
Never had a problem yet. I only use it to get money out though so maybe I am avoiding all the shit parts
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:13:19
Can you expand on this?
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:55:51
The volatility needs to calm down and that will take time. It's a very risky payment method for businesses to adopt right now but over time it could get better. It's a fun game either way at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:13:37
Spend it
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:05:08
For the moment. Product based businesses 2 years ago would be at a huge profit if they still had those coins. Bitcoin is cool, the concept and tech is amazing but it is far away from being a stable, and practical method of payment for everyday business use.
The truth at the moment is a lot of the new money that came into the market is from people who are viewing bitcoin as a way of making more fiat money. They get in and get out fast, hence the spikes and drops. I am fascinated by the concept and the tech behind it and believe it could be a great additional option to fiat money. It won't replace it. All just my opinion though. I could be completely wrong and taking out my arse
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:24:31
Why don't people want a block size increase? Wouldn't that reduce transaction fees and clear backlogs a little bit?
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:32:37
With all the posts on this sub the last week, I can honestly say that I have no fucking idea what is going on.
@_date: 2017-05-31 09:01:34
Internet is gonna internet
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:10:51
Pretty new to bitcoin and yea the transactions fees are very high, so is the wait time. I used to hear about how great bitcoin was because it was instant payment and had no fees attached to it. If the exchange rate goes any higher then the fees will be insane and put a lot of people off.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:42:22
Whenever more people and business start using and accepting it. 10 years maybe
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:01:21
Except if everyone did this then it becomes worthless

Stupid fucking post. If the government collapsed who do think runs the country. Prisons, schools, hospitals etc etc - the level stupidity on this sub sometimes is unreal.
