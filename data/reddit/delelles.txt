How much was the miner fee you attached to the transaction?

That's cool. But I don't think it would solicit local news coverage. I'm talking more about physically hiding paper wallets in the real world.
[MathGate.info]( is also a place where you can find hidden bitcoin by solving math problems online.

IMO, this is best to have in the event of an emergency, as walkie-talkies are big, and you're most likely already carrying around your smart phone.
This is what they say to the walkie-talkie comparison in their [FAQs](
* Integrates with the smartphone you already have on you
* Texts allow for less miscommunication than real-time voice
* Delivery confirmation &amp; automatic message retry
* Chat with specific individuals or groups, or anyone within range of you
* Don't worry about being on the same channel or having your conversation interrupted by others
* Share your location and points of interest on detailed offline maps
* End-to-end encryption for total privacy
* Small and light form factor

Looks like Lelo is selling the product themselves on Amazon at the same price they sell the product to retailers.

Maybe it was a temporary promo. I know Gyft also offers 3% on btc gift card purchases.

[Contact]( the [local news]( stations to ask them cover it.

Or, use bitcoinstore.com, where the prices are often much better.

Heehee, I agree, Urban Outfitters is certainly hipster as well. I've always considered AA mostly hipster. I assumed most people did, but maybe I'm wrong. I can't wear most of their pants because they're just too damned tight.
I'm wearing American Apparel sweat pants and t-shirt right now, which is why I thought to post this.
I linked directly to [their contact page]( where you can fill out their form if you're so inclined. I just shot them a message asking they consider accepting bitcoin.
Thanks for your help!

Just used a WF Gyft card today.
Just a heads up; you can only use up to 3 WF gift cards per transaction. When I first tried using WF Gyft cards to pay my $300+ total, I tried using 4 $100 Gyft cards. Their system only allowed me to us 3 of them, and I had to use cash/credit for the balance. Had I known this, I would have made two separate purchases.

How about all of them? I'll spend some time contacting these for sure...
We'd certainly be a well-dressed bunch should these retailers decide to accept bitcoin!

...and fuck regulations, too.

I never said I wouldn't, I just need to buy more! I'll be able to next Friday, l just thought people could roll with it sooner.

I've purchased a lot of groceries at Whole Foods with [gift cards]( bought with Bitcoin over the years.

What incentivizes the "spender" to use Purse/Amazon?
@_date: 2016-12-23 01:42:45
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:14:27
You're right, I meant to ask what incentivizes the "buyer" to make the purchase for the "spender" -- Here's a 2 minute video that describes the process, but doesn't talk about what incentive the "buyer" has for going through the process ----&gt;

You must have misread. "Additive free," like American Spirit. Normal cigarettes have hundreds of chemical additives to improve taste, as well as to make them even **more** addictive.

I'm using the iPhone and it's still asking for my password, which I'm entering, but then it asks me for a password again.
"Password Required - There was an error decrypting your wallet file. Please enter your main password below."
It was showing my Bitcoin balance and transactions. I just re-booted my phone, thinking that was the problem, and now it shows a 0 balance and continues to ask for my password.
What should I do?
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:04:48
There's the 'delete card' feature, which I use when the balance on any given card is 0. But, I'm guessing you don't want to delete them for some reason.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:42:34
Is your app showing your balance &amp; transactions still after you deleted then reinstalled? Also, is your email address &amp; identifier still showing up on the account details tab?
My balance shows 0 with no transactions, but I can still view account details (identifier &amp; email.)
Also, will it allow you to login to your wallet here?  - I'm using the correct passcode and it's saying "Error decrypting wallet, please make sure your password is correct."

On my iPhone 5, it's still asking for my passcode, which is correct, yet won't let me in. Same issue. It also won't let me in at: 
I was very, very, very, very lucky in that I still have my iPhone 4S loaded with with the app, which loaded up fine. This iPhone 4S wasn't even charged up and turned on until well after you said you were back up and running yesterday. Thank God! I created a new wallet with a new passcode and put them in there.
There are several question mark characters in my passcode that still isn't working on the iPhone 5. Could that be the issue?
I remember this happening back in around April. You were having issues with the network. My iPhone 4S app started asking for my password, which I tried entering, but it never worked. I could always still see my balance and transactions. Eventually it started working again on its own without having to re-enter the password.
This time around same thing happened, but I stupidly re-booted my phone, which I didn't do last time. When I went back to the app, it showed a 0 balance and no transactions (no data,) but still showed my Identifier and email address. It won't accept my password.
If the app is remembering my account details as far as email and identifier, should it not still remember my passcode?
