investing in crypto is the future.  Bitcoin has serious design flaws

Yes, you're correct most other cryptos, are jokes or scam, but that doesn't mean every other crypto is a joke or scam.  And bitcoin itself has been targeted by market manipulation schemes so it's not like it's innocent of scams either.
Crypto is the future, but there are doubts if bitcoin is the future.  Bitcoin, and crypto in general have major scaleability issues that have yet to be solved, and if some other crypto solves this problem before bitcoin does, bitcoin could very easily be replaced as the dominant crypto.

I literally said I'm not buying into bitcoin because I know the people who are pumping and dumping are more knowledgable than me and have better tools.  
If you're one of the people who bought into bitcoin in the past couple of months, but don't understand the technology behind it, then you gambled your money.

I've been following bitcoin for a while but I've never invested.  I consider myself more informed on bitcoin than most people I've met who have invested, but the reason I don't invest is because of all the speculation, pump and dump, and obvious manipulation schemes that have and currently are targeting bitcoin.  I'm competing with people who are more knowledgable and have better tools, so a safe, winning move is to not play.  
Having said that, congrats on all the people who mindlessly bought into the hype and walked away in the positive.

That value token doesn't have to be bitcoin.... You know this right?

I never said I was smart, but if you don't realize how easy it is to lose your money to speculation and investments you don't know anything about, you're dumber than you think.
