Since the hack Zane Tackett has claimed multiple times on reddit that the insurance is not applicable in this case because the loss is not a result of market fluctuation.
In any case I can agree with funkinaround in that Bitfinex has never mentioned the potential of losses for margin funding providers through theft of cryptocurrency. It seems they were completely unprepared for a situation like this. Very worrisome.

Well, you should be sensible here. Do you think a rogue employee stole the money which I could absolutely fathom or do you suggest that the company stole the money in an institutional way? The latter seems very hard to comprehend and absolutely illogical as they could have just offered their "BFX tokens" without this incident.

Why do you not comment on the snaypsepay situation?

Zane, please answer regarding the synapse situation. Is it true that those customers have not taken a cut?

Will bfxcoins be tradable from the get go or at some later point?

According to who? I'm a creditor of bitfinex and have significant funds at stake and I would be much more content with them continuing operation in order to be able to repay the customers eventually. A several years long bankruptcy procedure is one of the worst outcomes in my opinion.

This is very interesting to say at least. I'm certainly not expecting them to sell their family silver at this point because they need room to breath if they want to continue operating but they should absolutely use any liquid assets like BTC or USD to contribute to the loss. I'm also impressed that 120,000 btc only amount to 36% of their cusstomer funds apparently.
If BFX pulls through and manages to buy back the BFX tokens eventually I suppose it doesn't really matter as they then have compensated the users but what happens in between and how long that will take if it ever happens is the interesting part.
