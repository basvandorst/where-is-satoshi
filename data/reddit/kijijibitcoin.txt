i'd like to put in a request to see the CIA's original plan on how they executed 9/11 as a pretext to a multi-trillion-dollar war.  Seems a bit more important than what we do with our cryptographic technologies.

well look at the profitability of Bitcoin:
that just tanked yesterday. 
now suddenly the litecoin hashrate tripled yesterday.

there are over a dozen different mining companies on GLBSE, no need to advertise a single one.

Bitcoin profits got you down?  Here's a bit of help to get started mining Litecoin:

don't mine bitcoins with your laptop!!!  especially the 4xxx series are simply NOT worth it.  even if you had a brand new 7xxx series chip in your lappy, it wouldn't be worth the potential failure.  mining puts a card @ 100% usage, and they get crazy hot and you could overheat your laptop and kill it in an evening.

yes, people mine Litecoin with GPUs now.  
basically the block reward just happened on Bitcoin, making everyone's profits plummet, and if and when BFL (and other companies) release their ASIC, the bitcoin difficulty is going to go bananas, like a 20x increase, so there would be no way to profitably mine Bitcoin on a GPU, but you can mine LTC on a GPU.
It seems pointless how it was originally designed to make use of idle clocks since Bitcoin started to get mined by these super powerful video cards and if left all the CPU miners in the dust, now that people can GPU mine litecoin now its like they are two of the same, but Bitcoins' profitability if mining with a GPU is not so certain.  I think right now it's quite unprofitable, at the moment. 
So everything shifted. 
First it was CPU -&gt; BTC.
Then it was GPU -&gt; BTC, CPU -&gt; LTC
Soon it will be ASIC -&gt; BTC, GPU -&gt; LTC.
Don't believe me?  Ignore these messages, meanwhile the Litecoin network TRIPLES in 1 day.  LTC could go from 8 cents to 80 cents in a few months and you'll be kicking yourself you didn't mine them when the getting was this good.

if you want to see results fast, pick up a cheapo computer, like a Dell Optiplex GX280 can be found locally for around $100-110, or any small computer that can fit a PCIe card, then put as big of a mining card in there as you can, your best bet is a 5870 (400-420 MH/s, ~$150-200) or 5970 (650-750MH/s, ~$250-350), you'll probably want to upgrade the power supply to something decent like a Corsair CX600.  
That theoretical build would be getting you like ~0.25 BTC for a 5870 or ~0.45 BTC per day and this way it can run 24/7 and you don't have to worry about the laptop dying on you.
Of course you could pick up a $70 mobo and a $50 cpu and start building a proper rig to upgrade later, but if you are new at it I figured a cheap dell would be a good suggestion.
