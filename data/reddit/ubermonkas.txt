„Crypto education“
YouTube pays these fools so they can gamble without losing money no matter how much dumb shit they talk.
They don’t want to anymore which is a good thing.
Bitcoin and all other crypto’s don’t get the attention they deserve because there is so much Bullshit and scams and greed and fake news.
Nerds rule the world and always will. Get good and start learning. Gather knowledge and spread it. Youtube is not Wikipedia.
If you don’t like YouTube,  don’t follow the chain. 
Protest smarter.

Its probably some watercooled advanced and scalable and quantum extreme blockchain. All clones will fail. They are made to trade for bitcoin.

Depends on your broker.  You cant hold positions forever and 1% rise or fall is not enough no cover fees and opening or holding positions. You got only 100 dollars and you open a position for 25 dollars you need 25% rise to cover your opening alone.
Also you are paying for bitcoin but not getting any. 
100 dollars is not enough to do this stuff.

Calculating rates back and forth is very common everywhere in the world although you wouldn’t try to calculate how many coka cola you can get for your apple stocks. You also dont convert your fancy real estate into coffee cups.
Bitcoin is still in early development and could be a part of the very baselayer of what’s next to come.
I think people don’t know what bitcoin really is in this time frame.
Some wanna topple governments, 
Some wanna help governments, 
Some wanna help themselves,  
Some wanna help others,  
Some wanna help bitcoin,  
Some wanna copy bitcoin.
Bitcoin has gotta mature and evolve into something we all agree on.
Only then it’s no longer a game we play as a collective.

You can only mine altcoins and then convert back to bitcoin.
With highend rig eg ryzen 3000 and 5700xt you can make 1 dollar a day while spending 2 on electricity. 
Just buy bitcoin. Mining is dead for consumers.

Bitcoin is the supercategory, the Index.
Bitcoin is the observer and the attractor.
Is Newcoin the next bitcoin?
Its not. bitcoin is already the next bitcoin.
parasitic chains will die, symbiotic will survive.  In order to beat bitcoin you gotta be something else entirely and then you still coexist.
The best bitcoin is always gonna be bitcoin.
The next war is bitcoin vs govcoin.
Bitcoin can and will fight.
Every altcoin is constantly sucking on bitcoins milky tits
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:27:12
As long as people run the protocol, bitcoin will rise in value.
It will never go 1000x again but now is always gonna be the best time to get into it.
Stack some satoshis every now and then and keep living your live as normal. You still got at least 4 years but then it’s really to late. Only filthy rich people will get some pie then.

I guess he just retarded.
bitcoin is the product of the farm. 
you cant throw money at a bag of wheat and expect it to do shit for you. you could however get a mining farm and earn some bitcoin
