I'm pretty sure this is exactly what drug dealers would tell their parents if asked...

Why is that?

Something better could be created that replaces Bitcoin, which seems likely at some point in the future. My personal favorite example is that the 1st touchscreen phone was by IBM in 1992 and it was amazing at the time, then interest died off as it wasn’t that useable to most until the iPhone came around 15 years later. Or Bitcoin might be like Windows, and continuously evolve to stay relevant. No one knows with 100% certainty what will happen.

If bitcoin collapses in the next few years, is your ETF by itself sufficient to live off? (i.e. is putting half your money into bitcoin more or less than you can afford to lose)

If your US federal income tax bracket is 15% or less, your long term capital gains tax is 0 percent. 25-35% tax brackets have their long term capital gains taxes at 15%. Then then the top tax bracket has 20% long term capital gains tax, and then an additional 3.8% net investment income tax that was added in 2013. 
Additionally, State and Local taxes typically include capital gains as ordinary income regardless of short vs. long term holdings.

Elon Musk has also done that.

Neither Amazon or Apple where  at anything during the dot com bubble, so this makes a stronger case that some alt coin will take over if there's a bubble pop.
Look at Cisco (still hasn't recovered), Yahoo (still hasn't recovered), Microsoft (recovered last year), etc. that were major companies during this time period.

Well... that escalated quickly

Congrats! Since we're close to the end of the year, you may want to split your BTC selling over the new year to help with taxes. (e.g. Sell 25% before Dec. 31st, and 25% after), this could help lower your capital gains and/or impact whether the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax applies to your gains. A Tax Adviser could be well worth their cost here. (Assuming in the US)
EDIT: pointed out below this post is most likely fake, unless it's just a coincidence a nearly identical post appeared 4 years ago:

Just to add, typically the best bet for long term investing is a combination of Total Stock Market, S&amp;P 500, and International Index funds. Examples would be Fidelity FUSVX, or Vanguard VFIAX. Expense ratios of any fund should be less than 1%, or ideally less than 0.1%. 
John Oliver has a good video explaining the danger of small fees over time: 
"Actively managed" stock funds that try to beat the index funds nearly always make equal or less money over 10+ years periods. 
Alternatively, there's "Target Date" funds that will slowly adjust your risk profile as you get closer to retirement age. For these, Vanguard is better than Fidelity due to a much lower fee for the same product.
