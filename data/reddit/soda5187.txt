That was mean.

I'll just use a new address for each transaction from now on then. Thanks for the reply!

Really good video. But what can anyone do about it?

I don't think it's the quotation marks that are the problem. It's just a confusingly-worded sentence and there appears to be a typo: ON rather than ONE. It might also read more clearly if you wrote "bitcoin being its product" rather than "being bitcoin its product." Again, you can keep the quotation marks I think, but I didn't include them here.

I'm new to this sub but I've seen a number of really helpful people also. I think every sub has a few of those not interested in helping unfortunately.

I mostly use coinbase. I haven't been able to figure out how to generate a new address for the wallet, although it does appear to change on its own every so often. I don't think it automatically changes with each transaction. I've also used bitcoin core and that is easy to generate a new address but I didn't know there was a need to do so until recently.

So you're saying to use a different address as much as possible?

That puts my mind at ease; I was thinking I did something bad so I'm glad it's not really a major problem. Thanks!

Thanks! That's a relief. Not that you care, but no, nothing to hide I mostly just trade small amounts of crypto back and forth to try to make a little money like day trading. It's pretty fun.
