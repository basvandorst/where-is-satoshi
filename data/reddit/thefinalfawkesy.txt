If you'd like to read it all, here is the conversation between myself and mod bitcrunch:

+0.0905 BTC verify
One very last thing
Here are my ill gotten gains. Actually this is the exact amount that Julian and I split coming from our revenue from the videos4btc referrals. 
I encourage you to learn about Bitcoin but you can do whatever you wish with it. Tip it to some redditors, buy people gold with it. I don't care what you do with it. It's yours now.

I'm invested deeply in the bitcoin community. If my "good" name is going to be sullied I just want people to know the truth about exactly what I did. 
I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that my account is vapor. I don't need to "get my way". I'm fine with you banning the new subreddit, I even expected it so much I put a warning about it in the sidebar. 
I don't have a cause, you're the boss and can do whatever you wish. I had to make a new account just to reply to this post. It could disappear seconds after I post it. I just want it publicly known exactly what I did, why, and how I responded to that. 
Also, now you've got almost 1/10 of a bitcoin and with that much you've gotta go learn about it. Even bill gates would bend down and pick up a $20 bill off the ground. If the last thing I do on reddit is get a mod involved in bitcoin I'm fine with that.

Actually I miscalculated this. I didn't account for the deposit I made originally to test the site and also that Julian and I split the tiny amount we got 50/50.
Debited withdrawal (response: "OK") of 0.058 BTC to girlfawkesybtc - 1 week ago
Debited withdrawal (response: "OK") of 0.0475 BTC to girlfawkesybtc - on October 4, 2013
Debited withdrawal (response: "OK") of 0.042 BTC to girlfawkesybtc - on September 24, 2013
Debited withdrawal (response: "OK") of .0180 BTC to girlfawkesybtc - on September 6, 2013
Credited deposit of 0.075 BTC from your email address - on September 5, 2013
This works out to 0.04525 BTC I received from the videos4btc promotion. So effectively I earned $9.05 USD at current Mtgox price. Sorry for the earlier miscalc.

Just to make it fully public I received 0.00025 btc for every 0.01 btc spent on videos4btc.info. I don't think anyone would imagine that I would give up my username and everything i've ever done on reddit in exchange for the mere 0.08 BTC I received from this over three months.

Oh, incidentally if you reject the tip it automatically goes to Sean'sOutpost the charity for the homeless that runs on bitcoin donations entirely so that works too.

I posted the complete transcript earlier in the thread, but here:
For context, was sent to to all mods before I had any understanding what had happened and why. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:58:14
Will confirm, was banter. Had no idea of the seriousness of the issue at the time. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:16:45
All my accounts have been banned so i've created this one only to post this, then I will disappear:
I felt it was pretty clear from my posts that Julian and I benefitted from referral income from clicks to my own blog, stripcoin, and videos4btc.info. I openly admitted this in numerous posts on multiple subreddits and publicly apologized for it.
I also made it clear in my first post in the new subreddit I was going to help things get going, then remove myself as moderator and allow other people to run the subreddit. I never intended to moderate the subreddit after it was initially set up. This was present in posts in the subreddit, mod messages, and elsewhere on reddit.
I openly admit to what was done. Julian and I received a very small percentage of payments on videos4btc.info in exchange for supporting them as the official video host for the site. We'd previously had links to sites like stripcoin.com or my blog which also generated referral income. Reddit was the primary traffic source for those sites. I honestly was not aware this was a problem. I had seen countless out links to personal blogs or other sites with advertising in the past on other subreddits.
Perhaps I have a broken moral compass, or perhaps I just haven't spent enough time on reddit. Either way I am still culpable and I openly admit the wrongdoing, here, publicly, and to anyone who will listen. This is my fault. I screwed up. I did something that shouldn't have been done.
I'm sorry for this mess, I'm sorry that I did not live up to reddits expectations of me for mod conduct and I'm sorry I tried to make it right by helping start a new neutral community moderated by others.
Please do not punish the entire community for my isolated actions. There are a lot of good people who enjoyed ggb and other related subreddits and who were completely unaware of this. There were posters like fayflirts who had literally no concept and had their accounts banned.
Ban me, punish me, wipe me from the face of reddit but don't punish everyone for my misdeeds.
Lastly, you wrote "We prefer if you not moderate any more subreddits". I replied back to that and explained what had happened, apologized, and asked for a chance to make things right and try again and do a better job. I never heard back from you.
If mods cannot make mistakes, screw up, and learn from those mistakes there is no way to be a good mod other than being born one. I wasn't aware this was a problem, had I been warned I would have fixed it instantly. Had I been given a chance to live up to expectations I would have loved to do so. I would have loved to say I'm sorry, and try again to do better.
I'm sorry for my mistakes, and I'm sorry that my attempt to make it right was misinterpreted as being sneaky or ignoring the wishes of the alpha mods. I never heard back after my last message and I only wanted to help get things started and then step back and let other people handle it (like I said in my posts).
I'm not sure what else to say besides that I'm sorry and I wish I'd had the opportunity to try and do better. People make mistakes, we forgive them and allow them to learn and grow. I screwed up here, but I wanted to make it right.
