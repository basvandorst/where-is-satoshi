Pressing ⇧⌘G while navigating the Open dialog will give you similar functionality to the Finder’s “Go to Folder…”. You can also press TAB after typing part of the pathname to autocomplete.

People who care about the integrity of the answers they get from DNS, to avoid such nonsense as phishing scams aided by cache poisoning, or misguided attempts to legislate DNS blocks against unfavored sites (à la SOPA).

Too bad the [DNSSEC for bitcoinica.com]( is currently b0rked. No one with working DNSSEC resolvers can access the site at the moment…

The “mathematical problem” is coming up with an input to the [SHA-256]( hashing algorithm such that the output, when hashed again, produces a value with the required number of leading zero bits (based on the current difficulty, which is varied to achieve a more or less constant rate of block creation).
The input is based on a potential block of Bitcoin transactions to be added to the block chain, including the creation of some new coins to be awarded to the block’s creator. The “nonce” is just a field miners can modify in order to try to get the hashing algorithm to yield the desired results. Mining basically consists of trying all possible nonces over many different potential blocks until a combination is found that satisfies the leading-zeros condition.
The “rules” by which the network follows, e.g. setting the difficulty such that a new block is created on average once every 10 minutes, and capping the total number of Bitcoins ever to be created at 21 million, are enforced entirely by the Bitcoin client software. As long as a majority of the clients people run agree to the same set of rules (and reject deviations from them) then Bitcoin forms a coherent system.
All it would take to change the rules, then, would be for a majority of the people to run different software. Bitcoin is consequently a very interesting form of democracy.

Well, no. Is not the mod function just the remainder after division?
Assuming each of the 2^256 possible hash outcomes is equally likely, you would ideally want a fair mapping from hash value to ticket number. But that’s not going to happen here because some tickets have a greater number of mappings than others. Namely, the first 1936 tickets (2^256 mod 2000) have an ever-so-slightly greater chance of winning than the last 64 tickets (2000 − 1936).
This is easier to see with smaller numbers. Assume 8 possible outcomes, and 3 tickets:
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | ← Outcome  
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 1 | ← Outcome mod 3
You can see that tickets  and  each have three chances of winning, while  has only two.

A currency with an absolute limit cannot be devalued by making more of it.

This isn’t strictly true:




The result will be biased, since 2000 does not divide 2^256 (the total number of possible hash outcomes) exactly.

I’ll let you do that… I’m just offering some pedantry. :-)
