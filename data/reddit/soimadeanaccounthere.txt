True, but he was just pointing out that people can hold a lot of value's worth of currency and still have fun with it in reply to the other guy.

Eh, to start a less childish argument...how exactly is this guy a money laundering thief? From what I can understand, he gave a whole lot of people good tips, and then donated a good 10k to a damned charity. He said nothing's stolen, and though I'm not saying he's definitely telling the truth, no repercussions seem to have happened after his appearance (which I would expect if he did actually steal the metric fucktons of money he just gave away), and nobody seems to have been actually hurt. 
Is there something I'm missing here?

To be fair, have you actually looked at his archives? This is he first time he's poked fun at you guys. He's actually poked fun at doge 4 times in the comic (not to mention studiously praising you guys in *every other strip*. And as for the few insulting people, fair enough. A few dogecoin holders are assholes. No offense, but so are some bitcoin holders. Don't judge the entire thing off the worst peoples.

I think you're doing it wrong. It goes more like +250 doge

Not what I meant exactly. Listen, I get that you aren't really from here, and you want to have fun, and you don't agree with this guy. Hell, I come from that sub too. But what in the world do you gain from actively mocking them? Firstly, it's just kinda petty and completely pointless, and it's not like it'll make bitcoiners any more 'fun'. If anything it'll just make them less fun and less trusting of our community. There's a place for everything, but what were you trying to even achieve here?

Also, the constantly stickied newb question thread helps a lot.
