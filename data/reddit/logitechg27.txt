1)She is plain stupid.
2)She has a left-lib agenda against "tax evaders".
3)I don't like her!

Exchanges are very lean, with few employees. If I were a yakuza, I would sure invade an exchange in Japan, point a gun to the main employee or even the owner and say:" Deposit in this address or you will die!" 
It is way easier to do this with an exchange comparing with a bank.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:20:02
This is meaningless. The cop's quotes has nothing to do with Dorian being Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-02 16:29:17
Why staying away from kraken?
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:14:12
I found her letter to Karpeles:

We have two negatives: Dorian Nakamoto denies he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  Satoshi Nakamoto denies he is Dorian Nakamoto.
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:22:35
This changes nothing. Bitcoin is vulnerable. Deal with it!
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:36:44
The point is that someone knows what percentage of bitcoins MtGox have to cover customer deposits. Is it reflected on price?
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:20:24
So in relative terms, how those 1 billion a year compare to the recent thefts in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:14:39
She is evil. Take a look at the video:

Does this contribute to an increase in the block chain size?

Banks &gt; Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:14:36
What percentage of bitcoins MtGox have to cover customer deposits? 
Is this information already reflected on prices?
EDIT: It seems that SarahCoinBit have this kind of information.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:19:48
It makes sense. It is a possibility we should consider.
@_date: 2014-09-10 11:48:05
The truth is: nobody needs bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-03-03 18:22:30
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:14:17
This is social engineering for sure. If she can't do this stuff for getting the magazine cover, does she can do the same to rob someone else's coins?
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:10:59
It is meaningless if she correctly quoted the cops. This has nothing to do with Dorian being Satoshi.
Edit:puctuation ? for .
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:41:59
Perfect! Unfortunately, it is *very very simple* to rob vast amounts of bitcoin.
Besides, in the MtGox case, it was very easy to have access to  Karpeles. Just remember the few guys protesting in front of MtGox offices.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:55:31
You are correct and I support you!
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:43:45

You CAN'T trust bitcoin. It is not safe at all. It is a toxic asset/mean of payment.

I don't understand. I really really feel that you are trying to defend her only cause she is a blondie little girl.

:To check your balance, you need your Mtgox USER ID, from your first email of registration at MtGox.

If I see your private key, you are owned. If you see my money, all you can do is envy me.

I am a Kraken customer and I am very happy. Congratulations for the excellent job.
One thing concerns me about any exchange: what happens (G'd forgives me) if the management die, in case of a tragedy, or something? Will we be able to get our funds? Or they are so safe that in case of a tragedy, it is impossible to have our funds back?
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:39:17

I agree. It would be good if Dorian forgives her.
@_date: 2014-09-10 11:49:45
So the "two billion people out there now who are hungry to be included in the global economy" are the target for bitcoin?...nice.

Just to make myself clear: they charged twice for the same purchase. They didn't deliver twice.
I bought one banana, they gave me one banana and an invoice. They charged two bananas from my credit card account.  
How can it be my fault?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:02:37
I totally agree with you. One bad employee can take all the money from an exchange. This doesn't happen in banks. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:23:58
I think that one of the biggest problem is the total lack of transparency.

Katherine Forrest:In August 2014, Forrest dismissed a price-fixing suit against Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Glencore. She held that, although the defendant's actions did affect the aluminium marketplace, the plaintiffs failed to show the defendants had intended to manipulate prices.
