I will also keep trading on BitFinex if they bring the site back up and allow me to sell and buy coins again real fast. Withdrawal will probably be on hold for some days to avoid too many people leave instantly, i just want to trade and get on with life. 36% instant loss is much much better then bankruptcy and waiting for years to see if you ever get something back. Lawyers and courts, please spare me, this way as a bitcoin community we solve our own mess. The BFX tokens are a nice gesture, who knows. The 36% loss we can all make up again in not too much time.

Me too, had to convert to ETH to get my funds out, worked like a charm after many failed/stuck BTC withdrawals

Yes that still is unclear, logic to me says just to scrape off 36% of every asset, not convert.
But in the case they prevent trading maybe they will convert to usd.
In any way trading should not be prevented, i want to start to regain the haircut we all just had.

Same here, it says "withdrawal processing" but no BTC goes out.

Consider yourself lucky (-:
I was in ETC and those devaluated during their closure.
My final loss after selling BFX and finally being able to move out, 41%
Yes i blame myself, i went in in free will and got shaved.
Centralised exchanges are just as crooked as banks
Let's hope decentralised exchanges become mainstream soon

I am also still waiting on my withdrawal to be confirmed on the blockchain.
They have to regain confidence by playing open card concerning the hack, their bookkeeping and all.
If they do i will start to trade there again.
For now after having lost major, not only because of the 36% haircut but also because of locked ETC losing a lot of value last week it doesn't help my trust in them my withdrawal is still in limbo

I bet people of the US of A are screaming the loudest about lawsuits and suing. Like you consider it your birthright to go after someone until that person or entity is in one's grave.
Playing around with bitcoins isn't part of your safe space, life is risky and sure are cryptocurrencies, we all knew  and know that, now the fear comes true. Take some blame for your own actions, be a man.

Indeed no BTC withdrawals are going through.
I converted BTC to ETH and was able to get them out that way.

I fail to see the difference with MtGox.
Open up the site for clients to see their balances to keep the dream alive but file bankruptcy after some time when the storm subsides.
I also keep my hopes up to get a percentage back of my funds, swallow the loss and continue trading on bitfinex but that is just to avoid me panicking.
Seems BitGo is trying to hide

and we are waiting and waiting and waiting for the amazing expert support team.......
Reminds me again of how i have lost funds before at centralised organisations, bitfinex. Single point of failure, just like shapeshift. Yes i am stupid to trust money to greedy organisms, decentralisation please

Amazingly silent support team you mean. not a scam while they only steal 0.2btc? well they stole about 1000 dollar from me too. So all those amounts together...
They stole money in 3 transactions, .13btc, 2etc, 999gnt
