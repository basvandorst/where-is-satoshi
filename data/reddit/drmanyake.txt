Yeahhh bitch... Bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:58:05
I get your point. Just the other day I was telling my friend that I still believe BTC is the future of money. But it’s a shame that the crypto ecosystem is plagued with trolls, scam ICOs, guys like Roger that somehow got the media attention (oh and a lot of them behave like fucking kids), and other BS.
These things should stop for BTC to be taken seriously once and for all.
