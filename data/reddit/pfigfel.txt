Bitcoin is a crypto, Jesus Christ, that’s so immature to nitpick. Grow up.

It is, and I’m fairly new to all of this, I just bought crypto’s from Coinbase and used them to buy stuff, I’m not someone that’s very interested in it, I just use it (which, let’s admit, the people that USE the coins are the reason why it’s worth a lot, not the people that just buy and hold it in their wallets waiting for the prices to peak and sell) right? But that’s a bit condescending, which I don’t mean to sound like. But I did find a way to get my funds off of BitPay without having access to my wallet so I’m all good now :)

And... if no one is spending them, at all, they’re still worth anything; right? Wrong.

Haha, you have no self-esteem.

Why would anyone want to invest in something that no one spends or accepts as payment then? That makes no sense, whatsoever.

Yes, that’s exactly what makes it different. It’s tried, and true. Has more uses, used a lot more widely and is the standard for currencies of nations. People trust it more and you’ll always have it.

Gold is a standard, it’s tangible, and it’s used in a lot more than “payments” like jewelry, computers, and various other applications. Not just payments.

That doesn’t help my current situation, but I agree.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:55:36
Yes, that’s what I used and it worked :) Thank you
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:53:35
This is epic. Haha

Haha, Toxic people make life interesting sometimes, this is one of those cases! :)

I do have money in crypto, just not as much as I do in other assets. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:28:13
Doesn’t work. No options work at all to fix it, even reinstalling it
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:44:38
Well, you obviously don’t seem to understand my valid point, as I can understand yours, so I’m done with the argue meant as I have no more points to make. You made some good points, thank you. :)
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:26:15
Aye aye, it does indeed.

I thought they could stop your payment if you don’t pay a high enough miners fee, though? Lol
