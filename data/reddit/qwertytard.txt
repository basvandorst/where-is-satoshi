just used armory. did it in a ubuntu vm. printed out two copies of the key. one is in a lock box, one is encrypted with a one way key that i know in my head and kept in my finance folder. the offline wallet is kept in a truecrypt volume, on a usb key, that has a hidden TC volume and regular TC volume. a bit over kill, but when i was doing all this i was watching a spy movie i think lol

holy cow you sound just like me! not kidding, nor am i making fun of you. i kept putting off moving assets from bitfloor to my own cold storage wallet. i finally got around to making a linux vm and doing it 2.5 weeks ago. im reading this now, and reading the comments to see if anyone had a similar story to mine. looks like you made a mistake, sorry to hear that. i kept reading all these diff. btc exchanges being hacked and figured it'd be a matter of time till this happened to this guy. and it did.
sorry dude/dudette
@_date: 2012-09-21 02:24:29
wait, seriously? wow, i may need to contact my cc company   thx!!!
@_date: 2012-10-12 13:42:22
projects and ideas like this is what will keep bitcoin interesting and viable for longer and longer periods of time. this is great!
nice job
@_date: 2012-09-05 13:44:31
Good call. I'll start using that method, thanks!

if anyone were capable of helping you, other then trying to get the password out of your head, it would show the world hos fragile and insecure the bitcoin security model is. which it isn't. it is secure, as long as you use a secure password. which you did.

thank you for this explanation!

Only problem I see with this, is that the coins accepted by this person can then be used in a social network pattern.
The person who receives them, will need to "wash" the coins before use, otherwise people can look at the bticoin history and see where the coins where sent/received by whom, etc
@_date: 2012-10-04 02:18:59
dude, just stop. just stop.

if you buy with a credit card, you can just dispute the cost if they end up being a scam, no?

I've been thinking this, since day one.
@_date: 2013-03-02 21:16:36
getting the government involved, will only lead to big banks getting involved. the one thing that government and big banks have in common is corruption, and control. these are the two things that bitcoin is fighting against. this is not good news.

You're infected with a virus.
Possibly from pirating a video game, recently the new Farcry and Tombraider were infected with this, as well as Crysis 3.
The idea is that if you are playing these games you are using video gaming cards that can hash nice coin rates.
Delete the files, run malwarebytes.
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:30:56
Malwarebytes won't actually find this particular virus, you need to remove it from starting up, using msconfig to find weird shit. Also delete the folder manually and you *should* be good.
Damn dangerous world we live in :(
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:54:47
fair enough
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:56:47
keep this sort of stuff in mind, because its a great way to speak about btc to people who don't know about it, or are hesitant.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:20:22
got it
@_date: 2013-02-28 02:12:34
Lets say you bought 5 of those BitForce Single SC miners, they'd come out to: 6500
Now, at the time when these first came out, for preorder, a Bitcoin / USD was about 1 BTC / 6 USD so, lets say you bought Bitcoins, instead of the miner, you'd have:
1083.3 Bitcoins
Now, the price of Bitcoin has gone from 6 to 31 and is looking to hit 32, but lets say 31. So, if you had put that money into Bitcoins (and lets face it, if you bought the device's you figured the price if bitcoins would go up) then you'd have today: $33583.33 worth of Bitcoins. Which, you could have sold at some future date when the BFL labs production lines were moving along at a normal pace and bought those miner for 6500 OR bought roughly 26 of them. 26 of them outputting 60 GH/s would get you  1560 GH/s... holy fucking cow... now I don't know the difficulty that will exist when these ASICS hit the public space but still... that is insane. 
Just for shits and giggles I put it into the calculator for today's difficulty and got this:
	Coins	Dollars
per Day	฿214.88	$7,039.54
per Week	฿1,504.17	$49,276.76
per Month	฿6,532.39	$214,001.94
HOLY COWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
....i know i know, you can hold back your down votes (OR NOT!) the difficulty will get harder
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:14:49
Wow thank you!
might be a silly question but how do I accept a bitcoin tip?
tip or not, your "great story" comment is more appreciated! :)

i know what you mean, i thought it was some new IE update
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:19:13
Heh, Yeh. I dont know why the groups or members in the group are doing this.... but ok.
I may start tracking down the bitcoin addresses though ;)
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:18:05
oh sweet! yeh i have a "go-usb" drive, good idea with the bitcoins!

I'm thinking a bitcoin exchange linked to a chinese bank account.
@_date: 2013-01-31 04:11:47
Yes, but till that happens, this machine is making those Bitcoins!!!! awesome, jealous!

when you over clock, does your rig literally go on fire?
@_date: 2013-08-07 17:40:15
exactly that. its to make it seem like they know what they're talking abuot. thing is, no ones dealt with an economy based on something like bitcoin before, so everyone whos used to writing about fiat before, thinks it will work the same way this time. or, they look at btc as a type of "investment" and thus speak about it that way, in terms of popularity.
@_date: 2013-01-31 05:19:54
how come? genuinely curious.
@_date: 2013-03-29 16:50:33
i don't see btc as an investment, i see it as a replacement
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:25:42
bitcoin is legit
@_date: 2013-05-01 17:58:45
well that makes sense. some people use liquid cooling, and some people like to live on the edge and use gasoline to cool their rigs

you need to remember that iphone/apple has their own proprietary reasons for not having bitcoin on their system. 
   
if all finances go through them, they can take a piece of the pie.
with btc... not so much
  
i am NOT defending apples decision to be closed box, but  they've always been, so no surprises here, right?

during the time he was in the house, did you ever notice at any point any weird ssl errors? if so, he may have done an ARP attack to spoof the gateway, making your PC believe his computer is the gateway.
  
 at that point, he could've given you a fake ssl certificate to a website, while in fact, the traffic was being relayed through him, decrypted in front of his capture tool, encrypted behind it, making the website accept your traffic AND allowing him to eves drop on it.
the worst you could've done is approach him about it, before getting solid proof. now? he can format his drive, 0 out the sectors or destroy it physically (the hdd).
 
 next time? dd the disk, so you'll have a copy for later.
better to ask forgiveness later, right?

 RBI’s statement saying,  ”Bitcoin is emerging in India and it would benefit the users if RBI could regulate it or take ownership of it.”

   Ehm yeh
NO, clearly this guy is not enthusiastic enough, because the whole strength of btc is that no one can take ownership and thus control btc

The only problem is that the U.S. government came out a few months back and said that they don't view Bitcoin as an actual currency/form of money.    
So... were they really breaking the law?

it is and it isn't. i've read a few forum posts where people's cards were OC'ed and they became hotter then usual at night with the PC on, but they were asleep and unaware.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:49:30
Held and bought, bought like it was going out of style, and then bought some more.      
Only flipping and flopping I did was with LTC over at btc-e, between LTC and BTC, able to get more LTC in the process.

why don't we as a group take down the names of everyone involved in this "BFL scam", and shun them in the BTC community?
  
don't do business with them in the future?

this is actually the best thing that could happen to btc. why? when betamax was fighting vhs, who won? the one media format that the porn industry chose, which was vhs.
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:32:07
exactly this. the price fluctuation that happened 3 weeks ago was not due to bitcoin users/investors that have been hovering about btc forums for a few months/years. it was due to people reading articles and viewing television about it
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:09:46
you're absolutely right.  
they see bitcoin as a threat and probably have a task force of some kind looking for a slip up
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:13:42
i thought banks were making it harder for people to purchase bitcoin, but not the countries themselves.   
"While more countries are making it more difficult for its citizens to purchase digital currencies, there is a growing demand for services such as CoinMama."

It reminds me of persona management:

I think HSBC even has a service where people can buy good money with bad money, all in USD... no?
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:10:29
what would also be good, is to find a list of services and goods that the TOR network would need, and see if they will take BTC. It's a hassle to have someone convert BTC to some local currency to purchase something for the sustainability of the TOR network.   
Plus it would help start pushing BTC away from being reliant on other currencies, and to become its own
