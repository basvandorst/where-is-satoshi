I sold at 19k, thanks to all the hype and new stupid.money coming in. I'll buy again when it's 2,500 - 5k, after a few months in a bear market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:01:50
Haha yeah that won't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:51:46
�� 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:58:40
And why to invest in Bitcoin! This is critical to show that Bitcoin can defend itself! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:46:37
I sold out, this is too unpredictable 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:52:43
Awesome observation, we need to send a message that spammers will be dealt with to the highest degree. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:46:17
Because it's a Ponzi 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:39:53
This will be ongoing till BCH implements a new difficulty algorithm to stop the oscillating PoW between Bitcoin and BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:54:52
Wow I freaking love this! There should be a fund that awards the miners that do so.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:02:15
Or just not participate in any of this and save your money ��

@_date: 2017-11-14 06:55:33
What law, this is BITCOIN!!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:56:27
Divest From crypto completely it's too experimental!!!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:20
Not really transaction may take up to 48 hours oh and the fee is more than a bank wire... Such revolutionary currency my ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:31
Wow �� 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:20:51
I sold everything. ! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:16:11
The attacks won't stop because it's profitable!!!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:59:56
I'm not going to tell you what to do. I completely divested from Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. The reason why is because this fork war is going to scare traditional investors in the coming weeks and months. It's too experimental and I have absolutely no idea what's in store for the future.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:15:34
I dumped everything including BCH
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:57:30
I disagree this show those new Wall Street investors that Bitcoin is not to fuck with power of the people. They will love to see that Bitcoin can defend its self to protect your value! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:47:45
I sold out, too unpredictable 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:41:17
I love you!
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:40:41
Yeah I don't know what the hell is going on. I sold everything back to fiat and I'm just going to watch from the sidelines and see what happens in the next few months. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:53:41
Yup BCH is attacking and guess what this is going to be devistating for the entire crypto community! The only way forward is to have new comers invest into the coin and this will scare everyone besides people that are using it for money laundering!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:48:41
What goes up, must come down. And oh will she ever. Bitfinex is the new gox... 
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:21:36
Truth I saw the writing on the wall in 2017 it’s done folks pack up it was fun 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:17:45
They run a fractional reserve...
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:02
Yeah,  1300 -1800 by next Friday lol 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:51:05
I don't know of any former Executive or employee that has been murdered due to their exchange going insolvent. Yes, obviously someone has paid for a hit with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:48:15
It will be awhile, your most likely to sell before it recovers 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:38
No.. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:50:01
All Indian Bitcoin exchanges are scams.
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:08:04
Well to be honest I'm very surprised no one has been killed yet lol. A ton of people lost an insane amount of value from mtgox, Btce, and every other exchange that blew up. One of these days someone will get killed.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:46:02
Yeah,  1300 -1800 by next Friday lol 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:12:08

It's called the Chinese flush. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:52:05
Lol 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:52:21
Oh not for awhile bud
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:04:34
That's retarded after exchange and transaction fees your paying more for what you are buying than with credit cards.
