I'm curious... when I import from LocalBitcoins and Coinbase, the USD subtotals for those totals are used. In both instances, the fees are not included. On coinbase, I don't pay $1000 for each BTC, I pay $1000 + 1% coinbase fee + $0.15 bank fee. On Localbitcoins, I don't lose 1 BTC for the price shown, I lose 1 BTC + 1% LBTC fee.
On Coinbase's export, they have "Subtotal", "fees", and "total". It seems the "total" should be used as my actual cost. On LocalBitcoins when I sell, the "btc_amount" is the amount of BTC I "sold".
Am I correct in my thinking? Fees should chip away at my reported profits.

Kind of odd that you would tell people you're about to buy a ton of BTC before you actually do. If that had any impact on the market it would be upwards, making your purchase more expensive. Now, if you were ACTUALLY getting ready to sell... That's a different story.

That doesn't solve the problem of today's lack of market penetration... Through many garage sales, craigslistings, etc... No one has ever spent any Bitcoin (Well, not in buying something from me). Today it's basically a closed loop with BitPay and CoinBase merchants. I've yet to be able to complete a transaction, money in and money out, without USD entering the picture. There are lots of places to spend BitCoin, but I don't see, at least in my area, people looking to spend it. I can get Bitcoin by buying it. I can get Bitcoin by having my wages automatically converted to Bitcoin (Which is same as buying it, really). But I have yet to see anyone opt to use it to pay for anything locally, which basically centralizes it around BitPay and Coinbase.

The transaction ID you have may have changed due to the malleability fun. It is up to them to provide proof that the transaction occurred, by providing a confirmed transaction ID. You cant prove to them that a transaction doesnt exist.

I know nothing about BTER... But if your account on their end shows a transaction where you sent money out and you can't find that transaction in the blockchain, they need to provide a valid confirmed transaction ID that proves they transferred it out. Good customer service dictates that if you even THINK you didn't receive the coins, they would show you the proof that they have done everything in their power to transmit them.
If they are scamming you or suck at customer service, I have no advice.

@_date: 2014-02-11 19:13:30
Sent to a friend in an attempt to address his questions. Figured since it was a wall of text I might share it here in case not all of it is wrong. :-)
Heh. "Malleability" being in the news... There is something of a DDOS occurring right now, many nodes on the network are modifying the transaction IDs for basically every transaction thta passes through. This is freaking out some users who see both transactions out there (even though only one will ever be confirmed). It is also resulting in some funky balances in a few of the wallets.
The sudden widespreadness and attack on every single transaction is causing the following...
I send you 2 BTC... You want to send .4 BTC to someone. You need to use the 2 BTC I sent you to fund the transaction. The transaction you generate will have to be a 2 BTC transaction. I think you saw this yesterday. As part of that transaction you will send .4 BTC to the person's address and 1.6 back to one of your own addresses. Some Bitcoin wallet software, when it sees a transaction from itself to itself, will immediately mark that balance as spendable. Why wait for confirmations when there is a transaction we signed, sent from us, to us. So, with the DDOS occurring, you send your .4 BTC, your balance drops by .4 BTC.... but then the transaction gets duplicated by the attacking nodes.... And then your spendable balance actually appears to INCREASE... 1.6BTC. Your wallet will let you then try to spend those funds, but that transaction will never go anywhere because it is spending unconfirmed (and never to be confirmed) coins.
Apparently the most popular Android wallet (the one I use) does not succumb to this, but one of the most popular PC wallets does. The end result of the attack is A: Temporary confusion about your balance, B: If you send Bitcoin while the wallet is in that state, your transaction will likely not come out the other end since it is spending unconfirmed inputs.

This seems like an issue to take up with BTER. These are the official transactions involving that address:
If your transaction isn't in there, BTER never sent you your funds and it is very easy to demonstrate that to them. Regardless of today's happenings.

I had my own little project that petered out because I suck at javascript... But the /friendliest/ way to OSM is to grab your own set of the OSM data to query against. That is a big chunk of data though! I was working on a project that required custom tiles, rather than yours which just needs to grab some points and can use standard tilesets.
If those blow your mind, I can try to answer specific questions based on my previous work, but I'm not a guru either. :-)
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:58:34
The DDOS isn't breaking transactions... It's confusing wallets and software that rely on the not-immutable transaction ID AND unconfirmed transactions. I have had no problems at all today with transactions through LocalBitcoins, for instance. The only thing that is not working as expected is unconfirmed transactions in "improperly implemented" software.

I just bought my first thing from Overstock with Bitcoin... It took 23 minutes for the payment window to confirm that I had payed. It kept timing out and asking me to try again. "Sorry, the balance at this address is still 0.00 BTC". I had the first confirmation in about 5 minutes I think.
Congratulations to Coinbase for snagging this contract, but this was a really crappy first showing for me. Wife laughed at me, trying to show off Bitcoin... "And I just snap a picture with my phone and... wait... wait..." [30 seconds later] "Hmmm... let me just check Blockchain.info..." [5 minutes later] "Well maybe they're waiting for 3 confirmations...".
Overstock customer service was quick to respond, but at the ~25 minute mark, Coinbase finally reported me as paid and my order went through.

That would indicate that Mt. Gox is blameless. They're not. This is 100% Mt. Gox's fault. Anyone who had money in Gox was either unaware of the risk (ignorant, sure) or aware of the risk but willing to take it. Neither of those people "Deserve" the loss as if it's some kind of punishment.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:55:17
Based on the fact that you use Coinbase as your wallet, I'm assuming that the money you recently gave away may have been on MtGox? :-)
Curious, what benefits does an online wallet give you over a wallet on your phone as your wallet, a wallet on your PC as your safe, and a paper wallet in a fire proof safe as your bank account? Seems risky....

You can retrieve any information you want, as long as it's not one of a few "protected" classes of information. Obviously you can't FOIA social security numbers, but you can FOIA a list of all holders of a permit to carry a concealed firearm (which sure seems like private info to me), the salaries of public officials, etc. I would expect the results of an auction, even a sealed one, to be FOIA-able. The whole point of FOIA is that the government doesn't really get to call things "secret" without a damn good reason.

Nah, not rude. Just frustrated. :-) Y'all were definitely arguing about different things!
Obviously if Reddit is building in a way for people to trade their Bitcoin addresses, they're cutting themselves out of the fee structure, so other than "good will" and fuzzy things of that nature, I don't know why they would do it that way...
But I also don't know why they would build in a "withdrawal" address as part of the profile. Coinbase and other such web-based wallets generally ask for a withdrawal address at the time of withdrawing.
As far as ways Reddit would make money, I expect if they took a percentage of the tips, that would probably not go over well with (most?) people... They're not running an exchange, so having peoples' balances contribute to their overall balance wouldn't seem beneficial either...
I dunno. :-) I feel like it's just a simple profile addition. That would certainly be my preference! I hate all of the not-really-Bitcoin Bitcoin transactions that go down. I don't want to store my Bitcoin in your service. I want it in the block chain, and I want to be the one in charge of it.
Have a good day!
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:39:41
Different poster here. The Bitcoin address is independent of Reddit. Someone compromising your Reddit account would not compromise your Bitcoin, because Reddit isn't hosting wallets. At least not from this mockup. You could put a Bitcoin address in there that is part of a wallet hosted at Coinbase, or Changetip, or the wallet on your phone, or PC.
The only apparent risk, really, is that if your Reddit account gets hacked, someone could change that address, and any future tips would get sent to that new address.
This all assumes Reddit isn't storing BTC associated with your account and then disbersing it to your configured Bitcoin address... which would be an odd thing to do. Typically you would just ask for a withdrawal address at time of withdrawal, instead of having it configured in someone's preferences.
In theory, there would be a "tip" button next to my post that, when you clicked, would either directly open a bitcoin:// URI in your Bitcoin client or provide a QR code for you to snap with your phone.
Though, if people are actually depositing BTC into their Reddit accounts, your concern would be VERY valid. However, since Reddit wouldn't need to add a Bitcoin address configuration to user preferences in order to do that, it doesn't seem that's what's planned (yay!).
If I post this address:
Not only can no one do anything risky to it... But that's literally all anyone needs in order to send BTC. Reddit (or the whole world) knowing that address compromises nothing. In theory, "tips" from Reddit would go directly to that address, person to person, (why else would you include it in user preferences) rather than Reddit trying to manage Bitcoin wallets.
It basically becomes like an email address field in a forum profile... That doesn't mean the forum hosts my email, but that there is a button where you can easily click it and email me. Just more information in the directory.
Changetip is different because Changetip DOES store your BTC's itself. People don't need a Bitcoin address to receive Changetips (thuogh they do to withdraw it). I can send you a tip with Changetip and you can send it to someone else without the BTC ever leaving Changetip's control. You deposit BTC into your changetip accuont and then you can send to other people. That really isn't a "normal" Bitcoin transaction, it just makes for an interesting way to send "money" to people who don't have BTC, probably as a convenient way to encourage people to get a BTC wallet in order to withdraw it. If everyone had a Bitcoin wallet, changetip would be far less useful than a bitcoin:// button on Reddit that automatically fires off my Bitcoin client.
Is that any better?
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:33:25
I am not familiar with the services you are using...But the problems being seen are not that your money disappears, it's that if you are tracking your transactions by the "Transaction ID", you may lose track of the transaction if the "mutation" occurs. The transaction will still go through. What are the addresses in question?

You have to exchange keys in a trusted fashion. If you're not using web of trust, you're sending your key through PM. If you're sending you key through PM, and there is a man in the middle, you're fucked. A sends key to C. B receives intercepts message from A. B replaces A's key with B's key and passed message along. C sends message encrypted (With B's key) back to A. B receives, decrypts using own key, and then re-encrypts with A's key.
Note: I'm talking about public key exchange, people. You can't send an encrypted message to someone if you don't know their public key. Public key exchange is the hard part of this type of encryption!
