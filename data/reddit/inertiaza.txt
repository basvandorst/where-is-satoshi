Its not easy, but the whales tend to group at the right time which means a run. Proves patterns do have some prediction

lol ! read your comment again and read mine, you are just boosting what i am saying. obviously the supply is shrinking but Coinmarketcap does not reflect true value, its all speculation. The OTC Market is seperate.
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:55:48
okay sparky, please let me know then when coinmarketcap accounts for the OTC orderbooks and the retail exchanges orderbooks change to account for that.

everywhere i look their is bullish talk of bitcoin and i'm reminded that when people are greedy to be careful and when people are careful be greedy. i think it holds very true now, i don't trust anything coming from news anymore. a +- $2 trillion dollar anticipated Bull run has now suddenly became a $20 trillion "soon" Bull run. Come on what bs, i would LOVE that to happen but i think we, the non-rich investors, are being seriously set up. The institutional investors have bought in a LONG time ago after bitcoin fell to $6k and ripple at $0.22. They missed 2017 bull run but they manipulated the market back down to get in and as greedy as they are i am anticipating a further decline. The seriously rich don't play with small fry, they take from the poor and trade with the rich. Would you see rich poker players playing with poor poker players? No they play BIG stakes. The OTC market is theirs for the time being and unfortunately for us,the retail market, the true value is not being accounted for on coinmarketcap - our retail exchanges order books do not reflect this, BUT if we put our crypto away and forget it - DON'T LET EMOTION DICTATE YOUR ACTIONS. Before you guys flame me, understand this is just a opinion that can be something to keep at the back of your minds, and should the above prove true you can act accordingly. The Elite, the governments, wealthy want all the money and control, they don't want us to have wealth as they will lose control because of it. Eventually the OTC market will bridge into ONE market and THEN i think the Crypto Market will be massive but dont have expectations of a time frame guys. Invest with money you wont need for a few years and HODL! Wishing you all FREEDOM as i do for myself.

nice observation sparky, whats your point?
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:41:58
wahahaha ...i'm sorry.. Blockchain a technology of Bitcoin just automatically had that reaction for me.. i have to ask.. Do YOU understand what you are saying? So let me get this straight.. are you saying their is no blockchain without bitcoin ?
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:21:10
rollercoaster for sure.. i was expecting a nice downward there hahahha
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:58:10
Yeah man i fully agree, Tether is dodge as hell.. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:19:15
HitBTC and Shitopia are the worst exchanges.. lost a lot of money through them...
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:58:27
its going to have rebound effect......
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:22:04
19k was the moon, we back to earth now...well at least some of us :P
@_date: 2018-10-11 05:25:26
sell while you still can, we gonna have a reverse of last year. Bitcoin has no team no stability...rubbish as a currency, rubbish as a store of value. FOMO of last year wont be repeated, way to many people got burned...
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:41:53
not talking on a single exchange.. thats not how it works
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:31:17
We will have to just wait and see :&lt; BUT take a look at TrueUSD trading since BTC pump. So even if its 1% of market cap, i see quite abit of that still in the market in TrueUSD, PAX. $5000 BTC will suck though :&lt; ----&gt; this is worst case i think guys. Like i said i reckon these are whales creating serious FUD, tether will recover and the whales will have accumulated a lot more going into "hold thumbs" soon BULL RUN
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:44:26
bitcoin needs regulation. they are not stupid to throw away their money. watch now how btc is dumping, under 6k here we come, that was such a obvious bull trap its not even funny
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:57:10
yeah, 7200 - 7500 key point we need to break. Don't get to excited people. Lets hope for the best!
@_date: 2018-10-11 08:48:00
I don't own BTC, its just a middle man unfortunately for me..Why hold something with such a massive risk with such low gains while Real projects making awesome gains. where is the sense. only for the senseless i guess..
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:16:14
wow your life must be pretty sad if you regard the fall of Bitcoin as the end of the world. Bitcoin spawned the market - thank you BTC. thats about it now. Blockchain is the real Hero and will win. Couple awesome projects out there that will soon untether from BTC as they will be killing it on their own. What do you think will happen to BTC then? Does your brain have the capacity to look further? lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 13:18:29
yes i think it will go down, people are freaked out about Tether and if they choose not to go for other "stablecoins" then they will opt for selling BTC to FIAT. Most of us just watching if it falls below $0.90. personally i think whales are manipulating the shit out of the market and creating SERIOUS FUD..Weak hands will sell out of crypto. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 04:41:14
their is, most people
to dumb to realise what is going on and the elite are laughing their asses off, all the dumb investors will be shed from the market first. money is being poured in you just aint seeing it because its the OTC market that is being pumped, do you honestly think they want to make us rich. anyone who is waiting for a mega pump is seriously deluded. growth will be slow and takes years as they want it... impatient people will sell

To the rest of the world here is a prime example of a african with a major monkey on his back, they are now driving fancy cars and living the life and their brother zuma and malema stealing money and they still cry victim... thanx Wilanb, you just demonstrate your utter racism
