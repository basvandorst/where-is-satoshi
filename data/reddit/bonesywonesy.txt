Give them the coin/public key so they can look at it, keep the private key yourself, and when they want to learn how to retrieve it, provide them a one-on-one lesson and explanations of everything. That way they have to go through you. And you get to 'teach a man to fish...'

If you'd be pissed about losing what you have that's reason enough to get a hardware wallet.

My girlfriend and I had pretty much this exact interaction last night too.
Not sure how serious she was, but at least she wasn't like 'don't buy any more of that crap'.  =)

Or get on the QRL bandwagon =)

Yeah it'll be a pain in the butt. I'm kinda keeping tabs on mine though.
One thing I'm not sure about is if you mine the coin, there was no initial purchase, so the tax man couldn't really tell that you traded it for another coin unless you use the same wallets. In that case, I would think you would only be taxed on cash out, but I'm not sure. Still learning and researching! =)

If you did transactions through exchanges like coinbase or gemini, then they'll probably know that. They'd be able to tell that you did a transaction from there to somewhere else. They might not know you owned the destination wallet, but in theory they would just follow the paper trail, especially if you cash out big. If you think the government isn't working on tools to trace these transactions and discovering relationships between wallets then it's time to reevaluate. =)

This is basically what goes through my mind every time I see 'HODL'. =)

Read this post: 
TL;DR: In the US, converting one coin to another is a taxable event, cashing out is a taxable event, etc. Track everything for the tax man.
