Which conditions does it violate?

Thanks for your thoughts, I'm going to look into this more. I've had about a dozen tx dropped from the mempool and they've never been rebroadcasted.
Also, I don't believe nodes will continue to reshare transactions in the mempool. This is my understanding of how nodes work, and if I'm mistaken I'd love to see some hard evidence one way or another. It doesn't make sense for nodes to continually share their state of the mempool with other nodes, otherwise we'd be looking at absurd bandwidth requirements.
The current mempool size is over 100mb, and nodes aren't able to distinguish between transactions that have been dropped by other nodes and transactions that have not been dropped. When a transaction is broadcasted that's the only time it will be completely propogated around the network, unless rebroadcasted. Even if a node doesnt follow the two week rule, it would need to broadcast the entire mempool state after every block, as when a block is produced it changes the list of transactions still waiting to be confirmed.

if your receiving address starts with a "3" (P2SH) or "bc1" (bech32) then you're using segwit. When you go to send a transaction, it will be a segwit transaction
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:58:36
The only one I've used was ViaBTC tx accelerator and it was free. To be fair that was a while ago like I said and idk the current options
Usually how they work is the company works with a mining pool and tells them to prioritize your transaction over the ones with higher fees. Miners don't need to process tx with fees at all, but they're incentivized to because it makes the more money. They can choose any tx they want to. So they may have worked out some deal with the accelerator company to process the order they tell them to process
I'm assuming the revenue model is a split of the money you pay for the acceleration. The miner is still getting a fee (albeit lower) for processing your transaction, and maybe the accelerator company gives them a cut of profits.

To be more anonymous, you should use a separate receive address for every transaction. For more privacy, you can use a Bitcoin mixer. They basically take your coins and give you someone else's coins, making the coins anon. You can also trade your coins for monero, do a quick tx, and exchange them back. Since monero has stealth addresses and ringCT, they'll be completely anonymous
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:09:21
Bc1 indicates a "bech32" address, which will hopefully become the segwit standard in time. Currently the "3" you're seeing indicates a P2SH (pay to script hash). This type of address denotes a complicated transaction, such as segwit or multisig.
The "script hash" bit of the acronym means that there's a bit of code attached to it ( for multisig, it would be the code that makes need multiple signatures to be valid) is hashed (put thru a function that is one way, you can go original to hash but you can't go hash to original) and the coins are locked according to whatever the script says
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:10:47
No I get why it changes, my question was more specific about the hash algo.
I think I'm at the point where my btc knowledge is limited by my lack of higher level math :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:21:43
Can you link me somewhere that says they get rebroadcasted? I can't find anything talking about that on Google. 
Would that mean that the device that sent the transaction needs to be online at all times? What if you're sending from a hardware wallet? Who/what is rebroadcasting transactions? Is it a manual process? If OP does not have access to his private keys and there for can't open a wallet, what software is rebroadcasting the tx?
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:22:13
Ah, I thought electrum just added the P2SH version of segwit, didn't know they upgraded to bech32
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:09:00
So it doesn't really need to be zeros, its just needs to have a specific set of numbers at the beginning?
So assuming very low hash power, lets say you need 1 zero to produce a block. If it increases a little the numbers after the zero could be something specific? for example
where the bold numbers are the required numbers and everything else doesn't matter?
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:25:47
Is there any hard evidence for the first part? All i've seen is people saying its completely controlled but without anything to back it up
You can see all the markets for BCH on coinmarketcap, there were all sorts of pairs way before coinbase added BCH
This last one isnt even breaking anything. There was a demand for BCH, its evident in the fact that the price recovered from its low of $300

Hey man, unfortunately your transaction will eventually get dropped from the mempool if it hasn't already (IIRC it will drop after about 2 weeks). If it hasn't been dropped, you can try a transaction accelerator thatll get your tx confirmed quicker. Google "Bitcoin transaction accelerator," I haven't sent Bitcoin around in a while due to fees and the unreliable confirmation times so I don't really know what services have sprung up in recent months. Hopefully you get your coins back!

I think the theory is that they aim to profit off sidechains (sidechains is their business model, thats what they develop) if the main chain is too expensive to transact on. Both conspiracy arguments are a little off the charts, I have no idea what to believe

The lead maintainer of Bitcoin.org is some dude named Cobra. Cobra recently pushed an update to the website to get rid of the Bitcoin Core wallet software from the site and replace it with another node software called Bitcoin Knots. This update had no peer review and once detected it was immediately reverse by other maintainers of the site
He also recommended editing the whitepaper to align more with the current direction bitcoin is going in. In my opinion, thats fucked
A guy who pushed updates without peer review and wants to edit the whitepaper is one messed up guy, and theres plenty of other places to read the white paper. I don't really trust bitcoin.org anymore after the shit he pulled
its not the fact that they shouldn't read the whitepaper, its just read it somewhere other than bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:43:04
Regardless of where it is sent first, I always mix my coins to maintain a decent level of anonymity. That is going to happen whether I send it to a full node or a Ledger first.
I didn't know that Bitcoin Core could have watch only addresses, thanks for the tip although I'm getting paid in other currencies, making the whole thing kinda moot.
The whole Bitpay thing, do you have a source on that? Everything I've looked up has no mention of this extra $20 fee.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:37:56
I agree that 2nd layer is needed, but the day I can't send an onchain transaction because the fees are more than Im looking to send, I'm fully cashing out. The blockchain is what gives Bitcoin security, and if normal people are priced out of using it then it's useless except for the ultra rich
Edit: I'm a writer for a Bitcoin news site and I've already asked to be paid in eth or LTC instead of Bitcoin, because as soon as I send it to my cold storage I'm losing $10 in fees
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:28:20
Every single transaction should be equally valid on the chain. We're all peers on this network, just because you use Bitcoin doesn't mean you can dictate how others use it. if I want to but my coffee on chain, I can do as I damn well please
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:06:59
the "3" denotes a P2SH (pay to script hash) address. Basically any wallet other than a default wallet will start with a three. Some examples of P2SH are multi-sig wallets, segwit wallets, etc. Pretty much any complicated wallet. 
In the future, segwit addresses will start with "bc1," also known as a Bech32 address
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:27:34
While this is true, running your own economic full node is the only way to 100% verify the transaction. While have my own reservations about sending directly to a cold wallet (IE privacy concerns), running your own full node is still the only way to 100% verify each transaction as it happens. 
I really don't think I'll have a problem receiving a phony tx. But it's what I do to put my mind at easy 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:19:18
Not yet, but the plan is for bech32 to be the standard for segwit addresses. I don't know if/who has implemented this address format, however
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:17:10
Segwit was a transaction malleability fix, which opens the door for Lightning Network
If my understanding is correct (and if its not, feel free to let me know) any malleability fix can allow for lightning. Segwit isnt the only thing that can fix malleability 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:45:46
I guess its just paranoia. I completely agree, full nodes are cumbersome and expensive to run, but this way I have complete confidence.
If you are confident in receiving transactions via an SPV wallet, that's your prerogative. I prefer running it through the full node first.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:41:21
I consider 6+ confirmations to be secure, but still running the tx through the full node is a good look.
This point is kind of moot though, as I dont get paid in BTC anymore. Its not worth the fees
Edit: I consider the node a business expenses. I run it out of hobby now, as the University I go to offers "free WiFi" (it's free to access, but I definitely payed for it in tuition). It's not expensive to me. The fees on the other hand are much too high to consider conducting any sort of transaction on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:20:33
I mean anyone who is using Bitcoin Core as a wallet needs to send transactions from it. And if you're running core but not receiving transactions and verifying every tx for yourself, theres no point to running a full node
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:05:54
No reason, that's just the options I have currently. I'd accept Bitcoin Cash too if they offered
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:28:42
I'm assuming the reason not to have a blocksize increase is to make it easier for everyone to run a node
If we settle transactions on other chains and want the same full-node level of security, users need to run full nodes on the chain where their transaction settles
Either way, more block space regardless of the chain will be used
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:58:02
The whole reason to run a full node is to 100% verify that the transaction you receive is valid. If you're just running a node to run a node, it's not really doing anything other than helping other nodes receive blocks. SPV wallets (electrum, ledger, any wallet that doesn't download the full blockchain) is also 100% safe, except during a 51% attack or other attacks against the network.
I receive to my full node to verify it, then store it safely when I'm confident that it's valid. I trust my employer, but the whole point of Bitcoin is to be trustless :)
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:14:55
Ethereum offers a much in terms of smart contract functionality. Most of the op_code scripts were disabled early in BTC's life, but even then the scripting is not turing complete. Ethereum has solidity which is turning complete and let developers build much cooler things
But the whole reason the scripts were disabled in the first place was the concern that people would build crappy smart contracts and funds could be lost

The network is going to blocksize increase eventually, and at one point last year it was on the Core road map. The lightning whitepaper even says it needs 100+MB blocks to work properly.

If the entire community suddenly decided tomorrow that Litecoin as superior by every metric, does that become bitcoin?

Hey do you think you could explain some bitcoin related stuff to me? I am using bitcoin core and transferring funds from coinbase to the core account. When i "Back up Wallet" it creates a wallet.dat file. What is this file? Would i only need this file incase my hard drive died or something to restore my wallet? And does doing this make my wallet any safer? And do i need to create a new back up everytime i recieve or send coins? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:50:36
Regardless of how much your holding I would start out with a desktop wallet, only to at the very least learn how to send a transaction and what it looks like to receive one as well.
I think holding in the coinbase vault is silly, like if you're going to do that you might as well just make a cold wallet yourself. 
The amount money that would warrant a hardware wallet is different for everyone. Personally, I don't think I'd ever get one because I believe my current set up is at the very least as secure as a hardware wallet and is completely free. If you think that $50 is worth it to secure your funds in this way is worth it, by all means purchase one. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:49:02
Breadwallet and other person wallets are the only way to have full control over your funds. Out of the three it's the ONLY way to truly own Bitcoin. Hosted wallets you're trusting a third party.

Great! Nodes are the backbone of the network and help verify blocks and send them to other nodes
First off choose your Full Node software. The most popular is Bitcoin Core, but make sure to do research to pick whatever one you want to use.
In terms of requirements, its pretty lax. You'll need around 4GB of memory along with roughly 120GB of hard drive storage to store the full blockchain
Its gonna take some time for the node to get fully synced back to the network. Turning it off will force it to verify all the blocks it missed while offline, so its best to keep it online as much as possible 
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:37:47
No, Segwit had close to 100%. BIP 148 had a fraction of a percent of hashpower support
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:15:34
I don't really use exchanges, I just know that gemini and coinbase are both highly repected and regulated
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:37:08
Exactly. Everyone can do it so counting nodes is not a reliable metric of measuring support
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:43:55
The point of Bitcoin is to be a trustless system. People can trust these large companies, but if they want to have a trustless private wallet, one could make it as secure or even more secure than those wallets that are hosted
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:26:07
I think that BIP148, if anything, only gave the signers of the NYA a deadline. BIP148, despite having a bunch of supporting nodes, had next to no hashpower. Which is also why I think that people who ran BIP148 and were mad that the code for Segwit2x was being developed in such as short amount of time have themselves to blame
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:03:40
but what if one party is just creating thousands of nodes? its not that hard to spin a lot of em up 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:02:21
Most people's end game idea of LN is that almost all payments will be routed thought payment hubs. The most popular payment hubs will be those who have the most channels open with other users, leading them to become more popular. This becomes a HUGE centralization point, as hub operators can simply deny people to use the hub. At that point, without a blocksize increase, average users won't be able to use the blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:47:37
When people say segwit will increase the blocksize, it doesn't really do that. The 1 MB limit is still there, but the number of bytes per transaction will be "counted" differently. The some of the transaction data, specifically the signatures, will be "discounted" so that more transactions can fit into the block.
The reason this won't provide an immediate solution is that all of the addresses that currently have funds in them are non-segwit addresses. A non-segwit address can't send segwit transactions. Meaning that all of the coins that are regularly being transacted will need to be moved to realize the full effect of segwit. The moving of those coins could take months.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:25:10
Also its been like a month since the fork. Give it some time for the market to figure out which one is Bitcoin. 
The ratio of BCH blocks to BTC blocks is 1.0033. Thats a slim ass margin
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:29:22
by the same logic, why should the devs have the say? Shouldn't companies that handle much of bitcoin's transaction volume have a say in the matter?

While lightning can't control user funds, they can control who the funds can be sent to which is essentially the same.
I think lightning has a commercial use between two constantly interacting businesses or maybe of a debit card use. But using lightning for ever transaction is ridiculous, it's like you're not using Bitcoin anymore

Dude I'm not even sure what you're talking about. What is Second Wallet? What wallet are you using? Coinbase, electrum, etc.
If you're using a wallet that is accessible from a website and has a "recover your password" function, then you can go down that road. If you encrypted a wallet that opens like any other computer application (like a .exe) and dont remember the password you are shit out of luck
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:15:01
You risk losing money if Bitcoin decreases in price whether it's on an exchange or in a private wallet. It's always a good idea to keep coin in a private wallet because that is the only way to guarantee you own the coins. Your balance on an exchange is merely an IOU.
People will put their coins in a wallet either to spend them from the wallet or just to hang on to them. Not everyone with a private wallet trades on exchanges. 
The string of seemingly random numbers and letters that you saw on Bittrex was probably your deposit address. That was the thing out probably copied and pasted into coinbase to send the coins to Bittrex. That's what's known as a public key. If you have a private wallet, it will generate and public key/private key pair. On Bittrex or any other exchange or online wallet, you don't control the private key.  Meaning you can't actually spend the coins, you can only ask the exchange to send them for you. 
I'm not trying to knock exchanges or hosted wallets. I'm just saying that you can't control those coins 100%
The private key is usually hidden. It's a much longer string of numbers in letters that you'll likely never actually see.
The "seed" is a list of 12 words that allows certain wallet software to regenerate your public and private keys in another wallet. Most wallet software will give you this list when you first set up the wallet
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:31:20
Breadwallet is what's called a personal wallet. So when you install it on your phone, it creates what's known as a "private key." The private key is simply a file proves you own the coins in the wallet and gives you the ability to spend them. You don't own Bitcoin, you own the private keys needed to spend the coin associated with them
Blockchain and coinbase are both called "hosted wallets." These companies will hold your private keys for you, and send the bitcoins on your behalf whenever you send a transaction from one of their wallets.
The problem with hosted wallets is you don't truly on the coin on those website. It is, at best, an IOU and a promise to send the coins whenever you request them. For the most security, you want a wallet in which you can control your keys. Famous saying goes like "not your keys, not your Bitcoin!"

I normally leave my node running when I'm not at my computer, as it does get a tad laggy when the node is up and I'm using it. I don't normally notice any lag spikes. In terms of capping, there is definitely documentation out there than can help you do that
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:03:26
If you dont want to have a middle man, or device, you dont need too.
Right now if you had a hardware wallet you could simply skip over the device that sits between coinbase and your Ledger and simply send the coins from the Vault to the Ledger. I would still do the "send a little and try to recover it" thing no matter what you do
If you are going to go the desktop wallet route, the chance of a trojan or a keylogger in the midst of your PC is the risk you'll have to take. No method of storage is 100% secure, theres just varying levels of security. Just remember that this chance, while present, is insanely small.
If security is your number one worry, I suggest reading the [Glacier Protocol]( Its like a guide for holding bitcoins with an almost nutjob level of security.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:42:06
Depending on how much coin you're holding, a hardware wallet might not be the best idea at least at first. I would look into getting a [simple desktop or mobile wallet]( to start out with just to get comfortable moving coins around. I personally recommend electrum for desktop. Easy to use, very secure.
Electrum will give you a list of 12 words that serves as your back-up. So if your laptop goes tits up and your harddrive is corrupted or something, you can still regenerate your wallet on a different device. Many wallets, not just electrum, use this 12 word backup system including Ledger IIRC.
The hardware wallet option is admittedly much more secure than a desktop wallet, as the private keys are generated in the device and are never able to be exposed online.
Whatever option you go with, I suggest moving a small amount of Bitcoin, no more than a dollar or two, into your new private wallet. Then, wipe it clean. Delete the wallet. Get rid of the private key. To test if your back up really works, go ahead and recover you wallet using the 12 word list. If everything works great, then you're all set! You can move the rest of your coins into your fancy new wallet

I agree, sidechains are a whole other story. I personally don't know enough about them to make a complete argument either way for sidechains.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but are sidechains arguable more centralized? Aren't they federated by a third party?
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:22:58
No, not really
The miners that left to the other fork were the long time supporters of a blocksize increase, such as ViaBTC and some pools related to it.
The ones left on the BTC chain were everyone who was on the sidelines the past few years and finally have come together to support the segwit2x agreement
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:00:12
No, it doesn't have a "incase of politcal take over" clause. It following the most valid chain is kind of a no brainer. However, if the longest chain IS taken over by some entity, then yeah Bitcoin is a failed experiment. In that case either crypto will die all together or most will switch to another coin
Holy shit this is just dumb. If I turned on a shit ton of ASICS on a fork of bitcoin for an hour and a half, and for only that hour and a half, does that become bitcoin for that time period? Of course not. You need to look at both chains for a while, one will come out as the clear victor in terms of proof of work completed. Instantaneous hashpower does not make a chain superior to another chain.

If some miners stop mining, the difficulty of mining a block will decrease. Bitcoins are created from each block a miner produces and blocks occur on average every ten minutes. So if some miners drop off the network, blocks will still be produced every 10 minutes (due to the lowered difficulty) and BTC would still be minted at a constant rate

Hey dude I wanted to address some of the points you've made just to give people another way of looking at it.
**Quality of code**
Segwit2x has been publicly open source from the beginning. Anyone could have gone through for themselves and check it out. There isn't a single bug in the code that could cost users their funds, and if you've found a bug that provides this vulnerability you should report it ASAP
**Speed of roll out**
From the very beginning they've been stating their intent to fork within 3 months of segwit activation. The code has been done for a month. While I guess you could make that argument, its not that big of a problem
**Increased cost to node operators**
This is a valid concern, however it is necessary. There's no way that 1MB blocks will be able to handle more used regardless of lightning adoption (which has it's own centralization worries, but that's another discussion). It's been a long time since we had this amount of hashrate in agreement, I say we up the blocksize now while we can. Why put it off?
**Lack of replay protection**
This is also a serious problem. IIRC an "opt-in" replay protection was announced but it should be in there by default. Any fork needs to give users the choice to choose
For those people who don't know what replay protection is, it's a system put in place so when you broadcast a transaction, it doesn't end up on both chains. So for example, if there wasn't replay protection and you tried to send your bitcoins (not 2x coins), there's a chance it would also send your 2x coins. You're sending two assets to the recipent address
**Claiming Bitcoin brand**
Bitcoin is supposed to be whatever chain had the longest proof of work over time. May the best chain win.
**Hashrate dictating policy**
Regardless of the views of the miners, hashrate IS the most legitimate voting method in the Bitcoin protocol. You can't fake hashrate. You can, however, fake node count, community polls, or almost any other support measuring method
That being said, the UASF system is a good way to check miners control. The problem being that future UASFs need MUCH more community and economic support to he successful. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 23:34:59
No, the question is what attack vector would be introduced
Seriously, what problems do you see arising with optional fields. And how is this any different than optional segwit?
Also, the hardforks can be done safely. Set a flag day well in advance (6+ months, longer for more safety). Start releasing clients that support the new format, but will only support them come flag day.
Anyone who checks whats going on with development less than twice a year is probably not going to be running their full node

So you're asking what to do if you trade and own some alts, but just want to chill for a minute and hold the Bitcoin between periods in which you want to trade?
In that case, I suggest getting a private wallet and getting your coins off the exchange. List of wallets (here)[
Bitcoin is generally used as the reserve currency, most people trying to sell alts for fiat will convert to btc first just because it is easier to sell. 
You can go the Alt -&gt; BTC -&gt; Different Alt route, or you can use a service like Shapeshift.io or Changally to convert alt-&gt;alt.

Okay, but Bitcoin wasn't usable for most of late fall and early winter. Fees will more than likely go back to December levels within the next year and a half. Segwit adoption has been rubber banding around 35% for three months now, and that level of usage won't bring the extra capacity needed.

@_date: 2018-06-22 23:13:54
The argument for BCH isn't really about LN sucking, its more about letting it grow unrestricted by a blocksize. Most core developers see the blocksize limit as a good thing, most BCH developers don't
The lightning network has it's problems. While personally I don't think it can scale to the level people are imagining, it absolutely has great use cases. High frequency business to business transactions, basically anything where hundreds of small payments are made back and forth
If and when LN devs work out all the bugs and makes it much easier to use for tech-illiterate folks, it could be added to BCH. The point is not betting the entire network on a piece of new technology

There will always have to be payment processors, how else can you ensure you don't get scammed online? 
If you pay your BTC to someone, they have no obligation to send you the product. Using a payment processor adds the option to have a mediator if a transaction goes south in terms of buyer/seller relations
Irreversible transactions are a very valuable feature, but so are reversible transactions
@_date: 2018-06-12 04:23:30
lightning transactions aren't iron tight though. The person you have a channel open with could broadcast an old channel state where they get more coins than they should. The solution to this are watch towers, but you have a third party monitoring all your transactions
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:22:12
If, extremely hypothetically, one team controlled all the development of the network and refused to compromise with different parts of the community, what would you want to happen?
Personally I think another person/group of people should come together and make an implementation that provides a way to get away from this theoretical all controlling dev team. 
Now lets say this dictating dev team refuses to implement a change that a large section of the community wants. The competing team releases their product, and people can run the program if they prefer the second dev team's approach. 
What if the first dev team controls many popular discussion forums online? They refuse to allow anyone to discuss this alternate plan, even though a portion of the community genuinely wants this change. They argue the idea doesn't have enough support while banning the ability to spread the word about it and gain support. Anyone who discusses it is immediately labeled a troll, shill, pick your favorite insult. More often then not, they get banned of these forums controlled by the theoretical dev team
Would you call that moderation, or censorship?

For the hub and spoke model to work, the node must have a lot of money.
If Alice is trying to pay Carol and wants to do so over the LN, they would have to open a new channel with each other. But they quickly realize that they both have a channel open with Bob! Bob, in this example, is the hub operator. Alice sends 1BTC in the channel with Bob. Bob, being the rich guy he is, has 10BTC locked up in his hub. 
Bob in turn sends 1BTC to Carol. This is all done trustlessly, so that Bob can at no point steal Alice's funds. All parties can cash out at any time without risking loss of funds. 
Now imagine a scenario where Bob is the biggest hub in the town! Everyone loves using Bob's hub because he has all the best shops only use his hub. But its all good because Bob has insanely low fees. As more people flock to Bob's hub, it will make less and less sense to stay on other hubs. 
Bob's hub is the only way to transact via lightning network in this town, as all of the businesses use it not only to receive payments, but also pay their employees. All the people's monetary transactions are going through this hub. 
Now lets say Bob is getting a divorce. He hates his ex-wife, and decides to close out their channel. He won't re-open it. Is his ex-wife fucked? Can you explain why this *couldn't* happen? Or is the expectation that users would rally together to maintain decentralization?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:09:16
Just because they can't take your funds doesn't mean its not centralized. They can still view all transactions throughout their hub, and deny accepting transactions with parties they don't want to transact with. This could even lead to only specific addresses that are tied with your identity will be allowed to connect with the most popular nodes. If you can't connect with the most popular nodes with a full scale LN model, then who you can transact with is severely limited

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:50:49
You're doing something wrong then
Shapeshift was one of the first big exchanges to fully integrate segwit.
I just made a random exchange and you can see very clearly that it is a P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) address, denoted by the three at the beginning. Segwit is P2SH. Proposals have been made to change the segwit format to bech32 addresses, and at that point they would start with a "bc1"
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:07:00
This is where you need to be careful. Since the 2x upgrade is almost identical to the legacy chain, transactions sent on the legacy network will look the same on the new network. In this case, your coins on both networks could be sent to the recipient address.
I'd be like if I tried to send a Litecoin transaction, the Bitcoin network would just ignore it. But since the code for both networks is nearly identical and every wallet has identical balances, transactions can be valid on both
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:59:12
There's no explanation, just a restatement of what you said. Can you show me *why* the blocks will be 2.2MB?
Or maybe they don't want to use segwit? The beauty of a soft-fork is that its completely optional to use. I personally use segwit and hope adoption continues to increase throughput, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it isn't getting used to full affect. To me, that says people don't want to use segwit, but there's absolutely no reason to not want lower fees no matter who you are. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:55:21
No, he literally doesn't explain it. He just says that it is.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:01:03
The calculations mentioned in the article were done assuming 100% P2PKH for a blocksize of 1.6MB, and assuming 100% P2SH transactions for the size of 2MB. 


**filled** with 2-of-2 multisig p2sh transactions, you'd hit the limit at
670kB of base data and 1.33MB of witness data.
I agree that it is very safe to assume that the complexity of transactions is bound to increase which will inevitably lead to a higher blocksize, but these calculations assumed what you've been saying
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:53:33
You're right about multisig txs, all the signatures will be aggregated into one. This also affects txs that use multiple inputs, so if you are spending coins that are associated with multiple addresses (each address having it's own ~~private key and therefore~~ own signature) all the signatures will be aggregated into one, decreasing the number of bytes your tx will be. Schnorr will be an amazing advancement for the network, but there is no word on when this could become a reality
Edit: I don't actually know if every address has its own specific private key, but every address does need its own signature. The key however may be the same. If anyone knows one way or another, I'd love to know.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:18:05
You can't set zero fees if you want your tx confirmed in a timely manner. Some people still try and use Bitcoin as a currency, not just sending coins to a cold wallet
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:14:13
Theres no point to support the old fork though. The new Bitcoin Cash chain is identical to the legacy chain just without the massive hashpower changes. There was a reason to support ETC, as many argued it preserved the integrity of the code and the network. I can't think of any reason to support a chain that had a function that most everyone agreed was broken
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:59:38
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there only wipeout risk if there is more *work* done? Not just a higher block height, but each block has x amount of work done to create it. The legacy chain should theoretically not get any significant hashpower, and therefore even if they manage to overtake in height the upgraded chain is still not at risk.
Again, I'm not too versed on wipeout attacks and if I'm wrong I'd love a proper explanation. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:00:59
One thing to note is once you send coins to a segwit address you can still send them to standard format addresses. The number for txs sent from the wallet also doesn't compound to make fees cheaper. The thing that id actually making fees lower is the ratio of standard transactions to segwit and other P2SH transactions. As the ratio increases there will be more room in blocks for transactions, allowing more throughput and less congestion
P2SH (Pay to script hash) is the address format used by segwit, multi sig, and other complicated wallet types
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:06:41
At first, I agree there is no barrier for entry. Eventually lightning network hubs could scale to the point where everyone in a region is using a few hubs with some being much more popular than others
If an established hub that has channels open with every person or business you'd want to transact with, being denied from using that hub could have serious implications. Sure, you could to use another hub but if the people you want to transact with are on another you can't interact with them. Accusations of censorship could be cast against the hub, but this doesn't mean everyone would switch to a less centralized hub.
You could try and make another route, but if the hub controls the only path then you're not going to get anywhere
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:59:52
I disagree with a dynamic blocksize as well. This would be scheduled increases, dynamic implies is can increase or decreased based on the current market

a-3) If bitcoin plummeted to a tenth of its current price, like it has in the past, how well off would you be?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:39:08
That argument could be used for any coin that already isn't established. I support coins that I like and think have a future.
I also use Litecoin, and occasionally ETH. I'm not really on either side of the debate, I have both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. I think lightning network is going to be very cool, but I also thing on-chain scaling is essential for further growth
BCH works for what I need to use it for, and hope to see continued adoption as time goes on. And if the time comes where BCH and LTC are both at capacity, BCH will be cheaper. Or maybe the LN will see huge adoption quickly and I'll be able to send tx for pennies on many networks.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:08:50

@_date: 2017-11-07 23:34:48
What gives it anymore right to be called Bitcoin than a 2x hardfork?
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:31:09
I really don't know what to say now. This is literally agreeing with what I've been saying. Average of block assuming 100% segwit adoption is 1.89MB, not taking empty or low tx count blocks into the equation. These are important, as they do, whether you like it or not, affect the AVERAGE blocksize. I want to see the data including all blocks, regardless of tx count. I'd bet it comes out to close to 1.7MB as an average
Segwit blocks CAN be higher, and they CAN be lower. But the average blocksize assuming a very high percentage of segwit adoption will be pretty damn close to 1.7MB

Shapeshift implemented segwit over a month ago
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:44:59
First off, Shapeshift does use segwit addresses. I don't know where you heard otherwise. 
The beauty of segwit is that it is completely opt-in, no one HAS to use segwit if they don't want to. If Coinbase, BitPay, and blockchain all don't want to use it then thats their prerogative. You can't be mad that people won't use optional software.
It's completely valid to disagree with segwit and still want a blocksize increase. Just because you want scaling doesn't mean you have to support the current option on the table. The same logic could be made against anyone on either side of the argument that doesn't like high fees.


And also, these aren't shitty companies. I personally recommend them to people I know, as I use them regularly and they are almost always reliable. Shapeshift was one of the first exchanges of its type, letting people exchange between coins more seemlessly than ever. BitPay is one of the biggest drivers in helping merchant adoption, with almost every company that I've used Bitcoin to pay using BitPay to process the tx. Coinbase has provided one of the easiest onramp exchanges for people new to Bitcoin, and blockchain has an excellent wallet for new people to learn what a wallet is and how to manage it. And their block explorer is top notch. 
Just because someone disagrees with you doesn't mean you attempt to deface them and their company. Speak with your money. Use something else. But these attaks are silly.
Segwit2x has led to people viciously attacking companies that have made the space what it is today, and frankly its disgusting. People are getting death threats for supporting what is, at the largest level, a blocksize increase that has been in development for close to half a year with much of the ecosystem backing it. Forget backroom deals, forget corporate takeover. This is a blocksize increase, and people are making it so much more. The code speaks for itself. People keep saying that "if a bunch of CEOs can decide to change Bitcoin then all is lost." 
Code talks, bullshit walks. The code is a 2x capacity increase for the Bitcoin protocol, the worry is that some nodes will not continue to be able to function if this increase occurs. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:18:14
Bit of a correction, the current tx/s rate of Bitcoin is roughly 3 tx per second, not 6. Full segwit usage will give us average blocks of ~1.7MB, so call it a little over five tx per second with close to 100% segwit adoption
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:54:37
I would love something that forces the network to upgrade blocksize at a certain block, possibly in line with the predicted rate at which bandwidth increases.
Right now congestion is high and fees no only rise in the number of satoshis you're paying, but each one of those satoshis are increasing in value as well. If Bitcoin's price continues to rise, not even at this rate just in general, fees will quickly become too high for average people to use.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:59:42
There is nothing hard-coded into the protocol that increases the blocksize anytime soon. So realistically, while many Core developers have stated that a blocksize is on the roadmap, there's nothing guaranteeing a blocksize increase.

This is not true, but definitely do some of your own research on what segwit does and how it affects the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:45:57
There has been some discrepancy from exchanges on which chain will retain the name "Bitcoin" and which will be considered a different chain. Most have adopted the ethos of waiting to see which chain retains most of the hash power and which chain the majority of the ecosystem supports. If you know you want to purchase coins on the legacy chain or you know you want to purchase coins on the upgraded chain, check with your exchange about how they are classifying the two
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:46:54
So when you go to your wallet and get a new receiving address, each address is unique, and all the Bitcoin sent to it is tied to that address.
For example, I sent you one bitcoin using address x and someone else sent you one bitcoin usinf address y. You now have two bitcoins in you wallet. If you then sent me two bitcoins, that tx would be bigger than if me and the other guy sent you the two bitcoins to the same address.
More address associated with you wallet, the bigger the tx would be if you went to clear it to another wallet
Also, complicated Bitcoin transactions like multisig (a transaction needs multiple signatures to be valid) would make a transaction bigger
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:45:54

@_date: 2017-11-19 18:26:16
1. When you lock funds in a channel with amazon, what you're actually doing them is sending your BTC to a special multi-signature address. This address, or contract as its sometimes referred, does all the math and logic to ensure trustlessness. The tx you make to send funds to the contract does go on the blockchain
2. Yeah, keeping the channel open is the idea. Once the channel is open, you can send amazon as much money as you have locked in the channel
3. Since both opening and closing channels require an on-chain transaction, you need to wait for your initial transaction to be confirmed on the network before you can use it
4. Yeah I think the final idea behind the lightning network is that everyone will have so many channels open with everyone else that you'll be able to route your payments through strangers to get it to its final destination. I personally dont see how this can work, as every single party need to have a lot of money to be able to send payments coming through their nodes.
5. I think in the scenario in your head is kinda like a hub and spoke model, where people tend to use the lightning hubs that the most other people use, because then it would be the easiest way to send your payment. As more and more people use the same hub, more people will *want* to use that hub because its the one that you have the most options of people to send money to. This, if it becomes a reality, can lead to some very nasty decentralization problems
6. If you had a channel open with CanadaBTC, Canada's biggest LN hub, and they had a channel open with USABTC, then yeah theoretically you could pay people who use USABTC

It's a trade off. While when you go to send transactions I might be cheaper but it's also much easier to track your activity. If a Bitcoin address is tied with your identity, every can see every transaction you make
I recommend not reusing address. Doing this helps keep Bitcoin anonymous

LN isn't dependent on the percent tx in a block that use segwit. As the percentage of segwit tx in a block increases, so will the blocksize.

The BCH chain has been operating with 10-20% of the total hashpower worldwide, but the BCHL (legacy) chain shouldn't have any sort of market share. Its not listed on any exchanges and I think most everyone was in agreement that the EDA was not working and just fucked with both networks.
I'm still under the school of thought that hardfork =/= attack, but it seems like the Clashic chain just can't survive. BCH survived because they announced it well in advance, got a few major exchanges on board, implemented replay protection, etc. I dont see how Clashic can even get off the ground, who would be buying those coins?

Monero offers completely anonymous transaction, but at a cost. Ya know the whole blocksize issue? Well an average BTC tx is like 226 bytes, average monero tx can be upward of 2000 bytes. Imagine the backlog if every tx was close to 10x the size

Even with maximum Segwit transactions in a block, you can only get an effective blocksize of roughly 1.7MB. While I'd love to see this, segwit adoption is around 12%. Granted is it growing, blocks are still full and fees are skyrocketing not only because of the congestion, but also the recent bull run in price. The compounded effect of congestion and increasing price both drive up fees. Even fees that were very reasonable months ago, like 100sat/byte is now a very expensive transaction.
Assuming a tx size of 226 bytes, at a $4k USD Bitcoin price a 100sat/byte tx would cost you $0.90
$7k Bitcoins will run you, for the same tx and assuming the same fee, $1.58
At $10k, a standard tx at 100sat/byte will be $2.26
If the goal is to prevent skyrocketing fees, the price per tx denominated in BTC needs to fall faster than the quickly rising price.

Right from segwit.org, it says that a block containing standard single signature transactions, which are arguably the most common type, would be around 1.6MB. A block full of 2of2 multisig tx would make the block roughly 2MB. 
It also states that as more complicated transactions are created, the blocksize will continue to improve over time. While this is true, we don't really have that complex of transactions yet. I'm talking about short term, who knows what Bitcoin will look like years from now
It contains a link from the bitcoindev mailing list outlining how these numbers were found, explaining the calculations. He specifically quotes "1.8x increase"

I'm assuming this because fees denominated in BTC have been steadily increasing over the past year. With no immediate solution (segwit, while it is a solution, is not immediate.

I don't understand how one can differentiate legitimate used of the blockchain vs illegitimate uses. All transactions are viewed as equals on the network, that's what makes it permissionless. As soon as you start saying some transactions aren't as important as other you run into problems

@_date: 2017-11-04 01:21:02
Can you show me some data that supports the fact that we can get two times transaction capacity? From everything I've read the limit is 1.7MBish.
Also take into account segwit adoption. Right now the average blocksize is 1.05MB at an average of 11% segwit transactions per block. I'll round use 15% for this example, even though current levels are lower. It has rose to 15% in a little over two months, I'll call it two for ease of calculations. If we assume that that rate will be maintained, we would see adoption hitting the 90% range in *almost a year*. Even increasing the rate, lets say 15% every month an a half, you're still looking at an eight and a half month time frame before it takes full effect.
You're saying that you are fine with letting congestion increase exponentially (I'm assuming tx submitted to the network per unit of time will roughly increase at the same rate as number of users, you can look at Coinbase's recent enormous spike in users as an indicator of exponential user increase) is going to be good for Bitcoin? I disagree. One of the things that drew me to Bitcoin in the first place was the low fees, and letting them rise the way they are while we wait for second layer solutions is silly. I don't think we'll hit global adoption with no layer two solutions, but restricting layer one like this shouldn't happen.
Lets say Bitcoin hits $20k by next April. *Hopefully* full LN implementations will begin to roll out by then, but if not you're looking at, if fees denominated in BTC dont do down (which is unlikely as more and more people are buying in and looking to use the network), a simple 1 input one output tx of 226 bytes at, lets say 150 sat/byte, costing $6.78. That fee is not realistic to send any amount under a hundred dollars, and even than close to a 7% is ridiculous. 
You may not care about rising fees, but the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem that transacts regularly and often do. Businesses that accept Bitcoin trying to help mainstream adoption do.

If the recipent party doesn't have another route open then there's nothing you can do. If fees continue to increase  due to more users on the network competing for block space, it will be economical to open as few channels as possible because that's less you'll have to close.

@_date: 2017-11-08 02:40:19
The price of a transaction is not dependent on the amount of BTC you're sending, but the actual number of bytes that your transaction is made up of. The current max blocksize is 1MB, so roughly every ten minutes 1MB of transactions are confirmed.
Fees are usually priced in satoshis/byte, with a satoshi being one one hundred millionth of a bitcoin (1/100,000,000). Right now, fees are looking to be 140sat/byte to be included in the next block
If the speed at which your transaction gets confirmed is not a a concern for you, you can set a lower than optimal fee and hopefully get your transaction included in a later block. It really depends on why your sending the BTC that can determine how fast you want it to be confirmed. If you're trying to send it to yourself on another wallet, waiting for confirmations isn't a problem. However, if trying to buy something you usually want your tx confirmed as soon as possible
If you send a tx with too low of a fee but you want it confirmed faster, you can use a function called "Replace-by-fee." This will submit an identical transaction to the network but with an increased fee in hopes of having a miner confirm it sooner. Don't worry though, this does not mean you are spending coins twice. If one tx is include in a block, the other one automatically becomes invalid
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:22:55

What would you value an asset that is completely permissionless to use, has the ability to be transferred anywhere in the world for a relatively low fee, can be physically transported by simply remembering a series of words, when you send funds there isn't a chance of charge back, and there is a mathematically defined finite supply?
If you can answer that, you have the true value of a Bitcoin, regardless of what level of adoption it is at right now.

How? What has BitPay done that indicates they are looking to profit off of something other than their payment processing service?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:58:16
Other than BTC, no crypto is a clear "number two" in term of merchant adoption. I guess you could argue Litecoin and Ethereum, but still BTC has a HUGE market share over every other crypto for online payments. Most places that accept LTC or ETH started with accepting BTC.
BCH is trying to carve out a piece of that market share for themselves and that's just fine. 
And to be fair, BCH currently has a higher TX/sec limit than LTC. LTC can pump out, on average, one 1MB block every 2.5 minutes. This leads to max 4MB worth of transactions every 10 minutes, vs BCH 8MB max blocksize every 10 minutes.

How does BitPay gain from high transaction fees? Their whole business model relies on people using their service to make payments to businesses that accept Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes more towards a store of value use case instead of electronic cash and fees continue to increase, less people will want to use it as a currency, meaning less people will use BitPay overall

this is not an explanation, this is a statement

This is stating that a 4MB Segwit block would have a similar capacity to a 4MB "legacy" block


This is the condition that needs to be met to hit a 4MB block


What ratio is this? Where is the source? Is there hard data to back this up? Wheres the math? How is he coming to this conclusion?
The rest of his post is explaining why activating segwit would be better than increasing the blocksize to segwit's limit, the last sentence refuting OP's claim that segwit has nothing to do with block propagation
That is the entire post sentence by sentence. Where the hell does he explain why segwit can achieve 2.2MB blocks?
On top of everything, in an earlier comment he made *in the same comment thread* says 


Get the fuck out of here with these bullshit claims. Also, he still doesn't explain how he comes to this number. I'm more willing to believe 1.9MB, but I want to see something tangible that shows WHY blocks will be 1.9MB

5. Do you think that, along with LN, the blocksize will need to be increased to handle transaction volume in the future?

What multisig would you want? None of them really make sense and just cost more tx fee wise
Assuming 2 of 3 mulitsig, (you have a key, third-party has a key, receiver has a key)
The only way either of you can get funds out of the contract is if the third party uses their key to move it (unless both parties agree on an outcome, unlikely in a possibe scam scenario). This is no different than coinbase/bitpay controlling the keys outright. Not saying it's ideal, but we need payment processors.

To compromise! Many of these companies did not want segwit, but they did want a blocksize increase. So, as most compromises usually work, the two sides agreed so that those who wanted segwit get segwit, and those who want a blocksize increase get a blocksize increase. 
If you want to make an argument about "well I didn't agree to no compromise!!1!!" then everyone who is now opposing the 2x side of the deal should've been fighting segwit activation tooth and nail, as it was meant to also be a blocksize increase. I can't believe the people who won't hold up the second half of the compromise
If you want to make an argument that BIP148 activated segwit, that's just false. It had way under a majority of nodes and less than 1% of the hashpower. Whether you like it or not Segwit was activated thanks to Segwit2x.

Yes! I don't know! I'm looking for an answer and you are just being insanely rude!
The website has a very nice graph that shows you the number of inputs that exist for different types of address types. But even diving into all of this data, I would have still no idea where hes getting this number. 
I haven't looked at the graphs in depth because there's no point, but is he trying that if that there's a higher percentage of P2PKH than what the current was, would the max segwit blocksize increase? Or visa versa, and a increased percentage of P2SH would increase the limit?
Even if he stated this, I still have no idea how you get a blocksize from the ratio of P2PKH and P2PH. What calculation is done to find this out?
I'm not a Bitcoin developer. I don't know probably 90% of how it all works under the hood. Everything I've heard has said 1.7MB. When you made a claim that contradicted what I thought I knew without literally anything that would explain how segwit would allow for up to 2.2MB blocks. When I asked for an explanation or some evidence, you linked a developer that literally contradicted what you said and failed to do any sort of meaningful explanation. When I called you out, you were a dick, called me an idiot, and told me to do the research myself.

Oh I don't doubt it, the blocksize would need to be huge to accommodate visa level transactions. This is, from my understanding, the idea behind onchain scaling. Also keep in mind that as more users join the network, we'll have more people with the resources to run a full node.
I think onchain scaling is needed and was needed a year ago, but to think that onchain can handle absolutely everything with efficiency is dumb. Second layer is needed but without turning the main chain into a settlement layer. Lightning network won't solve everything, or even get close
That being said, people have to remember that technology is getting better all the time, and the list of options we have to solve Bitcoins problems is getting longer every year. Increasing the blocksize is definitely needed but there's ways to make it have as little impact on end users as possible
Edit: for bch specifically I've read that they're trying to have fees as close to a zero as possible. The block reward wont run out for another hundred years. The price makes up for the halvings, as Bitcoin prices have way more than doubled every four year. Mining 50 BTC back in 2012 at $200 a piece would've landed you $10,000 (assuming you sold your pay your electric bill) is nothing compared to 12.5 BTC at $8000 fetching $100,000
Let's say BTC prices get to $26,000 by 2020 (the next block reward halving). Mining a block will meet you 6.25 BTC plus transaction fees, netting the miner just around $160,000. Lots of people would say $26,000 is conservative, and if it at the very least doubles every four years (which is has so far) miners are getting fat raises before you even add transaction fees into the picture

Before RBF, it was difficult to send a second transaction after the first had been broadcasted. Most wallet software just simply wouldn't allow you to spend coins that are already a part of a transaction in the mempool. You could broadcast a transaction manually (which I don't know how to do) to double spend, but for most users that isn't an option
When RBF got realeased it was a feature that allowed you to re spend coins already apart of a transaction. If you're tx is stuck at the bottom of the mempool then the ability to send a new tx with a higher fees is very nice
The problem is before RBF the mempool never got large enough to warrant RBF. The number of tx in the pool was low enough that miners were able to clear all if not most of it in a block or two. You wouldn't need RBF because there's no backlog of transaction, and since there's no backlog your tx would never be at the "bottom" and would eventually get confirmed
Edit: zero conf is enough security for some, not enough for others. For retailers, 0-conf makes sense (assuming RBF didn't exist). You wouldn't have your customers wait around for 10 minutes waiting for a confirmation. You'd get more business by accepting 0conf because people wouldn't have to wait.
Sure, some dick might fuck you over once and double spend their coins, but you'd have to look at that as a cost of doing business. The profits from the dozens of customers that you attracted by accepting 0-conf hopefully out weights the loses from people double spending g
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:39:42
I think the idea with Bitcoin Cash is to keep increasing the blocksize to the point where miniscule fees add up. Let's say at some point in the future transaction fees on bch are 10x less than BTC, but they have 10x the blocksize. The same fees would be paid to the miners
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:13:57
Zero conf is not what makes transactions stuck. When a transaction is in the mempool with thousands and thousands of other transactions with higher fees on top of it, no miner in their right mind would take the lower fee one. Whenever you're sending a transaction, you only need to outbid everyone else's transactions to get included in a block. Whether the common fee at the time is $1 or $100, the miners don't care as long as it's more than all the other txs in the mempool
If the rate of incoming transactions is faster than what the network can clear, no miner will ever get to your tx as txs with higher fees are coming in all the time.
We are already seeing miners force a minimum fee, it could technically be any fee level tho. Some miners won't mine transactions with less than a 5 sat/byte fee. Some equilibrium could be found, as miners would want a low enough minimum fee to intice people into sending a tx, but high enough that they're still making a profit
On top of this, not every miner needs to agree on a minimum fee level. Some smaller miners may pick up extremely low (maybe 1sat/b) just to add to their profits more.
Again, all of this is assuming bigger blocks which doesn't look to be happening anytime soon if ever

So the most important thing in this scenario is controling your private keys. That is that 12-word recovery phrase that electrum made you write down. That is your way to access your coins on both chains should they both survive.
In a scenario where one chain emerges as the dominant one and the other dies, that 12-word phrase gives you access to your coins no matter which chain wins.
If both survive, then eventually something would have to be put in place to stop any sort of interference between the networks. When it is safe, you will be able to import that 12 word phrase into two wallets, each compatible with one of the networks.
If you just hold, you'll be fine

Okay you didn't day of this before, all you said was "Hardforks are lame."
Frankly, there's no way we are scaling with only layer two. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad segwit finally activated and need to spend some quality time learning about shnorr sigs. Despite LN being  a really cool piece of tech, it won't work woth 1mb blocks at scale. We need onchain scaling as well.

Back in august a fork called Bitcoin Cash or BCH happened right before segwit activation, the most noticeable change being an 8MB blocksize increase. Come november, another fork is scheduled off of the 1MB chain to increase it to 2MB
I really dont like how any fork is now being labeled an attack. It sets a bad precedent

The segwit2x client has been essentially finished for several months now. It was released in July. If you want a better metric, look at the July thread
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:41:46
Segwit was activated via a method know as a soft fork. This means that using segwit is completely optional
The quick Eli5 explaination of segwit is that it counts the number of bytes in a transaction differently and applies weight values for different types of data that make up the transaction. Sending a "segwit transaction" is usually cheaper, and to a user like you that's really all that's important about it.
Segwit transactions can only be sent from segwit addresses. So if you have some coins on an address, you would need to send them to a segwit address to send a segwit transaction.
Bottom line: if you do nothing, you're fine
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:19:06
You can't really confirm your own transaction. It needs to be done by the miners. Sure, you could buy a little piece of consumer hardware and make a little money and secure the network, but even then you'd be contributing to "pool" of miners. There's dozens of mining pools
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:59:01
Can you clarify? Are you saying Bitcoin will loose because of the blocksize or some core developers leaving? 
Also, can you explain why you support 1MB forever? It seems reasonable to increase the blocksize proportionally to the ever advancing level of consumer grade hardware. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:19:29
Dude, look at the graph. that's raw data. It explicitly says that the average tx per block is just around 1800, dipping above 2000 sometimes
As fees go up, less and less people have transactions that are important enough to pay those fees. Usage slows. Fees remain high as the backlog is unable to clear
@_date: 2017-09-29 14:46:35
Yes. The risk comes from just as you said, sending during or after the fork. Doing nothing is completely fine

I support the NYA. I personally don't think the UASF was the reason for Segwit activation, as it didn't have close to a majority of nodes and held less than 2% of the total network hashpower. It was a minority with a loud speaker. 
Bitcoin will need a 2MB block increase in the future, and currently we have an unprecedented amount of miner support. 93% is very difficult to come by. 
And while node count is important, proof-of-work reigns supreme on the network. If 93% of the miners agreed to do something truly malicious, such as mess with the 21mil coin cap, then the price would plummet. The miner's hardware is now obsolete and their BTC holdings are now worth pennies. 
Nodes can be spoofed. PoW can not.
The legacy chain will be fried with only 7% of the old hashrate, producing blocks ever few hours. Fees will skyrocket as the network becomes unusable.
On the issue of the Core developers leaving the Bitcoin project with a successful upgrade to, its looking to be that the Core developers are quitting rather than being fired. Most of the entire rest of the ecosystem (miners, businesses, some users, etc) all support this. If a 2MB increase was merged into the Core repository then the hardfork would be a non-issue
I really dont know whats going to happen come November, but I hope that he community can stick together and choose one chain. My hope is for the upgraded chain to retain most of the ecosystem, but if what has been plastered to the front page for the past few weeks is true, and a super majority of users do NOT want this change, then per consensus rules I'll stick with the 1MB chain. 
I personally dont think the support against 2x is as large as it seems. While a huge majority of nodes on the network are Core nodes, only 27% are 0.15.x, which is the version than disconnects btc1 nodes from the network. BTC1 does not have an easy download and setup process, and a lot of users aren't going to know how to go into a github and set up their own node.
Time will tell the outcome of this fork, and I'm not dumping my coins on either side. May the best chain win

Please show any evidence that segwit can give a effective blocksize of over 2MB. Nothing would make me happier than segwit taking full effect and lessening the mempool and lowering fees, but segwit alone isn't going to do that. The math doesn't work out, most estimates land the effective blocksize of 100% segwit transactions at 1.7MB
Second layer solutions are absolutely required to scale at the rate that's going to be require in the coming years. A blocksize will give the network breathing room, allow for continuing adoption, and when second layer comes fully an increased blocksize will still allow more capacity

A chain that confirms transaction insanely slow with exorbitant fees isn't going to be worth much. Sure, it might start to pull value back after the difficultly adjusts (assuming enough miners continue to mine to trigger the adjustment)

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:56:20
Okay, but the 2x upgrade isnt doing that. It is increasing the blocksize, not increasing the coin limit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:24:17
Yes, they can and probably do do this. But it doesnt make any sense to from a strictly business point of view. Why would they ever want to include a transaction with less money associated with it?
The profit margin for mining is razor thin, trust me these companies are going to go from every edge they can get
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:03:28
where the hell did you learn math? How are you getting 4000 transactions per block? Its roughly 1800.
Plus, if the transaction capacity was cut to 20% of current levels then fees to be included in those blocks would skyrocket. It would be completely uneconomical to use a chain like that, which would drive more and more users away
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:23:05
Why are they hindering adoption and not all the wallets that don't support BIP70? It's an easier format for this business, so of course they're going to use it.

It will increase the transfer time of blocks, but its not going to be as drastic of an increase as you're expecting. The time for the entire network to receive a block, but miners can't centralized nodes to this degree.
You also need to remember that broadband internet around the world is increasing every year. This will become less and less of a problem as time goes on. 2MB block are not a death sentence.
I would love to see second layer solutions develop over time, but we are going to need a blocksize increase eventually. Blocks are already full, so why not now?

It would take over a month with 20% hashpower to trigger a difficultly adjustment. There's no miner that would want to be operating at a deficit for that long, even with much much higher fees. If the miners move to the upgraded chain, the leagcy chain would be crippled and require a hardfork just to stay alive
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:31:00
Do you have any other argument other than they're lame
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:54:25
So if all the miners currently signaling for the 2x upgrade mine the upgraded chain and the leagcy chain slows to a halt with exorbitant fees, would it make sense that the upgraded chain gets more use? And in turn, the money goes to the upgraded chain, and then less and less miners mine the leagcy chain. 
Literally the point of proof-of-work was to create a system in which Sybil attacks couldn't occur. You can fake Reddit accounts, Twitter accounts, and even nodes. You can't fake hashrate, and right now the hash rate is looking to upgrade Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:39:57
That is just ridiculous thinking. A blocksize increase is in a complete other realm than doing something as insane as raising the coin cap.
Bitcoin should be able to change, to adapt, to grow. If the precedent is set that any hardfork upgrade is immediately labeled as an attack and deemed a "shitcoin" then Bitcoin will stagnate and another coin will overcome it.
This isn't a blueprint for attack, this is a blueprint of how to upgrade Bitcoin. And I hope it is used when needed, and right now the network is at capacity with no solution in sight (LN and other second layer options are still months and months, if not a year, away from mainstream adoption)
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:23:55
I don't have any links on me, but some Core developers have explicitly stated that they will not continue to work on Bitcoin if the upgrade is successful. I personally think that's ridiculous.
People keep saying this whole thing is to "fire core." The upgrade is set to happen no matter what the developers say at this point, or so it seems. The Core developers could kill all controversy and further cement the Core client as THE Bitcoin client if they merged 2x.
This isn't the Core contributors getting fired, its them quitting
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:14:32
Anyone can use the blockchain for whatever theyd like, that's what makes Bitcoin great
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:48:43
If they are planning raising the blocksize in future years, why not now? A decent size of the community has been for a blocksize increase for years. If core merged 2x, then the biggest points against segwit2x fall apart.
The core team wouldn't be getting fired, it wouldn't be a "big business take over," and it wouldn't be a "closed room corporate deal." There's no need for a fork, I just can't wrap my head around why the core team would ever want to cause so much disruption on the network instead of moving up an upgrade that's planned for the future

They're comparing before BIP70 implementation to today, and the landscape has changed dramatically. 
When/right before they implemented it: 
* Loads of new users coming in from the bull run
* high BTC price meant people that had been holding for a while might want to take a profit, whether thats selling at an exchange or buying goods and services
* Blocks haven't been super full recently, even dipping into the 0.7 MB and below range the past few months. Less commerce on the BTC network in general
* Lots of the users from the bullrun have exited as most were looking for a USD profit (and they got it)
* Less people want to sell/spend their Bitcoins right now as prices are low, they're expecting them to rise.
* Massive boycott campaign against Bitpay ever since they supported the blocksize increase
Do you think these factors have less of an affect than Bitpay implementing BIP70?
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:30:55
That doesn't take away that all the other wallets have had it implement for a while now

* Xapo

No, it's an upgrade. It's not an altcoin, it's bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:44:25
Yes! It's called OP_RETURN and it allows you to attach a small string of characters to your transactions. Currently you can only add 70 characters IIRC, but other networks have successfully raised that limit to 220 characters with zero adverse effects
@_date: 2018-07-19 13:56:21
It gets kinda hard determining what is a waste if space and what's not. Bitcoin us supposed to be permissionless and censorship resistant. If someone pays the miner fee, who is to decide what you could or can't store on chain
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:50:12
Running a full node is kinda like confirming for your self what the miners are saying, but you are making no money from it. You have no direct monetary incentive to run a node. You dont get transaction fees or anything
What a full node DOES allow you to do is directly confirm every transaction you receive.
It also acts as a backbone for the network. When receiving a block (block = set of transaction that have been confirmed by miners) your node will help propagate the block around the network and confirm the validity of the transactions in the block.
Again, you wont receive anything for running a node except for the complete assurance that the coins you are receiving are 100% legit. Dont get me wrong, many non-full node wallets are amazing but running a full node is the only way to verify 100%
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:06:53
What most of the existing infrastructure are you talking about? Only core 0.15.x nodes block 2X signalling nodes from the network, and they only make up 27% of the network.

Bitpay is very easy for any company to set up, and thats why they're the biggest payment processor at the moment
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:56:02
Why? It's more expensive for their business
I would say a majority of Bitcoin users are not advanced users (not saying you aren't, just in general)
As time goes on, the ratio of advanced users vs normal users (people who don't understand fees, block times, mempool, etc) will decrease if Bitcoin is successful.
That means most of their users aren't going to care about fees and standard BTC addresses. It's sooo much easier to just paste the invoice into your wallet and hit send.
On top of this, giving users an "advanced" option may lead people who don't know what theyre doing to use advanced options. If a noob sees under "advanced" that they can cut their fee in half, you better believe they will. They just don't get it.
If the mempool is full, that half fee transaction could take a while to confirm. Now they have the noobs freaking out because their transaction isn't confirming. All the while, the noobs are on Reddit bashing bitpay saying they've been scammed, or they're hammering Bitpay support asking what the hell is going on. They have to pay for support staff, infrastructure to receive these support tickets, etc
Or, they implement BIP70 that takes care of it for you. This is honestly the best this for their business, the format has absolutely no downsides and everyone is freaking out because of nothing
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:35:03
Of course not but that's not what's happening here. It's a blocksize increase not a suicide pill
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:04:12
That's debatable, one could argue that ASIC mining is less secure because it leads to centralization of mining
@_date: 2018-07-04 17:42:50
That is just not true. The format has been around since 2013, and almost every wallet on the list has had BIP70 implemented for a long time
Electrum support in version 2.0
Bitcoin Core support since version 0.9
Breadwallet has supported the format since release
On top of all that, Bitpay's blog post from January 2018 listing CURRENTLY supported wallets
Why blame Bitpay for the few wallets that don't support, instead of blame wallets for not supporting a major BIP used by the world's biggest payment processor?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:31:26

Mycelium [already supports BIP70]( and you can use connect your hardware wallet to electrum and spend from there.
Samurai wallet has just around 10 thousand downloads, so that's not very popular. Exodus is already a terrible wallet because they consistently set recommended fees significantly higher than they should be.
I'll give you blockchain.info, that is a huge service. But it's also one only a few major services that doesn't support it.
For the payment URL, it is significantly easier that doing a normal transaction for 80% of people. You just paste it in, it sets the amount to pay, fills the address box, and all you need to do is hit send. Extremely simple especially for new users.
As for the fees, Bitpay doesn't demand higher transaction fees. That's just not how the Bitcoin network works. You broadcast your transaction with a specified fee. If your fee is larger than the rest of the transactions also waiting to be confirmed, your transaction will be included in the next block. 
Bitpay's network fees are outlined [here](

No, think of it more as a recipient. When miners confirm the transaction that you are receiving, node makes sure the miners, who are confirming the transaction, aren't feeding you baloney info.
It's more of a validation
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:25:28
BIP70 may have had an impact, but definitely not as much of an impact as everything else that has been going on the past 7 months
None of the disadvantages listed in the Samurai post explain anything. They say it's easier to implement KYC/AML regulations. How?
One argument I've heard is "Governments could make you attach your real name/govt ID to each transaction for it to get mined."
First off, if a government can control which transactions get mined and which don't, Bitcoin is a failed system. Flat out. 
Secondly, *this is already possible with current bitcoin transaction formats*. OP_RETURN is a bitcoin script that allows you to write data into the blockchain using a transaction. You can put 70 bytes of data, plenty of room for a name.

This is just a rumor then. If there is no direct evidence, don't make the claim. Just because multiple pools all add hash power doesn't mean there is some huge conspiracy, maybe some people legit just want bigger blocks.

Source on 40+% signaling BIP 148?
Last time I saw it was like under 3%

How do I know if my software is rebroadcasting the transaction?
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:18:49
You say push a change quickly, would a hard fork be instantaneous? How would the time frame compare to a soft fork? 
Can you give an example of something that would vary in result depending on if you soft forked it or hard forked it?
I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions, I feel like the only way to properly take a stance on the scaling debate to to understand the technicalities of both sides and it's kinda hard to figure this all out

Look into a service called Abra. I don't remember all the details from when I read about it, but from what I do remember it shoiuld be just what you need

They don't fork because of exactly what you said, it's dangerous. Everyone in this situation has financial interests in mind, and a hard fork with this amount of hash power IS dangerous. Why would they want to fork now with the trend of increasing support for BU?

Do you recognize this picture from localBitcoins? Or do you recognize this from something else....

What about the huge supporters of a blocksize increase? Wouldnt you think that they see the current state of Bitcoin as bad and be scared to invest, but this alternative with a higher blocksize be "safer" in their eyes, inticing them to invest?
Those people's money wouldn't normally be going into Bitcoin. Same as every other altcoin where people like an aspect of it more than Bitcoin causing them to believe and invest

electrum also has an android app
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:00:52
In what situation would a hard fork be needed then? Why not just soft fork in every upgrade?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:09:51
Chill with this
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:25:24
literally "1" hash
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:40:56
Thats just silly. There are not many things in this world that are free, but this is. You get money simply for owning Bitcoin. If you dont at least have a plan of what you want to do with it, you are a fool

i made the mistake of taking a break from this sub just days before the asicboost scandal broke and i was lost for weeks

I'm personally a fan of the New York compromise, which hopefully will actually be followed through on. Is there a point there miners need to start signalling for the agreement?
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:26:26
It's all good bro, just trying to limit any false info out there

PSA: Electron Cash is NOT made by the electrum devs. It is simply a fork made by someone else

Anything else would've been ridiculous. No problem with Trezor wanting to protect their product, but completely closed source would've been bad

Whether you like it or not, over 85% of the hash rate is supporting this proposal
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:58:14
Are you telling me you have a moral dilemma about getting rid of BCC because you think it's a scan?
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:14:57
No, that is completely wrong. Bitcoin's security DOES come from the amount of hashpower you put into it. If a hostile party decides they want to attack the Bitcoin network through a 51% attack, then they need a RIDICULOUS amount of hash power to stage that attack. If we had a very little amount of hash power than it would be very very easy for anyone to just come in and destroy the network
That is one of the main arguments against Altcoins. Bitcoin has better security BECAUSE of the hashpower on the network
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:59:21
less people want to send bitcoin because the transaction fees are high
what part of that doesnt make sense
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:09:24
The core developers have specifically stated they are not merging core and BIP 148

The golden rule is don't invest more than you can afford to lose. That's different for everyone. I'm still in high school and I drop $20-30 every chance I get. 
That being said, $100 to $200 is a fantastic start
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:56:58
Yes, but the scam coins more than likely have no chance if challenging Bitcoin in terms of market cap or price. This person is saying all altcoins are enemies. Do you think Ethereum or Litecoin are scams? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:18:01
Why are you so attached to Bitcoin? Altcoins are not an "enemy" or something to defeat. If one day an altcoin is just genuinely better than Bitcoin in every aspect and hits worldwide adoption, would you use it? Or are you so religiously into Bitcoin that you'd rather see your fortune die than be a part of a world with a truly decentralized trustless currency?
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:57:28
This shouldn't be anyone's mentality. If you're going to support a compromise, support the WHOLE compromise. There should be no "Well i got what I wanted out of the deal, now lets fuck with the rest of it"
The only way out of this scaling debate is compromise. And if people refuse to, then they will get left on another fork. It sucks that both sides have some people with this extremist "lets go to war" mentality. This isn't just a software experiment, this is a $40 billion industry. And this "war" that people talk about, while one side may come out ahead, it will destroy Bitcoin and prove that crypto-currencies as a concept do not work. It will never reach mainstream adoption because why would anyone trust their money to a system in which there is so much infighting?
@_date: 2017-06-11 00:26:57
Hash power isn't only being held by one party otherwise we would be at the will of the person, and as far as I know we have yet to see a hardfork
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:16:07
i laughed if it makes you feel any better
