Since in the short few minutes I've been up here, I've received a bit of hate, I figured I'd post an explanation. People have money trapped in Gox, and some of them believe that money is lost for ever. I'm willing to bet that the money isn't lost forever, and instead Gox will either be able to pay out its BTC, or at least partially pay out its BTC. For those people who have their money trapped that think they'll never see it again, this is a way for them to hedge their bet that they get nothing, by getting something. For me, who believes that Gox will pay, I get to hedge the bet that they pay out by purchasing at a risk adjusted discount.
I assume this comment won't change anything from people who were going to respond anyway.

buying *now*. I think the fx rate looks like a bit of a bubble. I bought more than mined previously, but the rates were such that I was willing to pay. While I'm not going to guess that I'll see super low rates again soon, today's rates do not seem realistic to me.

Good point. I have to read the text of the hearings/discussions on capital hill and with the Fed. I'll figure out how much time to invest after seeing what America is doing to regulate the market and bitcoin's usage.

Reading comprehension isn't your thing. Have fun with Bitcoins.

I guess I'm not well enough versed to know of anywhere that would let me short bitcoins the same way I could in an equity market. If it exists, I'd love to know about it!

The post was to ask if its worth adopting back into bitcoin after a FX bubble is in full swing, but before there is general market acceptance. There's nothing in here that suggests "get rich." Judging by your questions and your fragment with a question mark, you didn't really read my post.
