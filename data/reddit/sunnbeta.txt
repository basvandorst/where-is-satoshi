Past performance is not indicative of the future

hopefully that does it, it basically has to

I would argue that none of it was... the fee problems have only increased as more people bought in as a high risk investment

Yes credit card transaction fees are a few percent, but you can often get 1-2% cash back on major credit cards, and it’s the seller accepting CC payment who actually eats the fee (sure some of this is then going to be baked into the prices you pay, but if you pay cash, the seller basically makes a little more... they still overwhelmingly accept credit because the convienience of accepting it and getting those sales more than makes up for the fees). 
ATMs also have fees yes, but also easy to avoid if you use your own banks ATMs. 
At this point I just think the crypto fees are a huge barrier to its use as a daily, real world currency.

Why would anyone choose a system that forces them to manage money like that? It would be like needing to keep track of separate bank accounts for everything type of thing you buy, or every vendor you buy from.

It does to get it in and out

so you need to keep coins/$ dropped into a channel for long term use... ugh that is going to be a nightmare

LN is far from the magic bullet some people seem to think it is... the more open chains, the less BTC works the way it was intended and is being marketed (secure, untraceable)... but with fewer it doesn't provide much of a benefit

What is the functionality you speak of though, it's currently pretty much useless as a currency...

I think you can be Long bitcoin but still aware that it may very well be in a massive bubble.
I saw this with 3D printing a few years ago when people were buying up Stratysys and 3D systems stocks purely on buzz, without knowing much about the tech itself. They crashed hard, doesn’t mean it isn’t viable tech that will continue to become more and more used and important, it just became overinflated due to speculation of uneducated masses and not any real inherent value.

Well ok, $30 then, or even at $300 for that matter... 5% right off the top is just not gonna fly long term. 
I want to be Long bitcoin, but this could be a serious issue.

Just be a realist and recognize you may have gotten a *great* buying opportunity, or you may be trying to catch a falling knife.

In fairness a lot of people are now holding bitcoin because news of crypto in general is starting to go mainstream. In a very informal poll of family over the holidays, the vast majority still don’t even know what bitcoin is, but are starting to hear that people are making money on it. Which, unfortunately, is indicative of being in a bubble.
I saw the same thing with 3D printing stocks a few years ago. People bought up the stocks without understanding the tech or the market. That bubble burst. That tech is still viable it was just priced incorrectly due to speculation.
Bitcoin can still be viable, but that doesn’t mean it’s current value is “correct” - not to mention that not many of the new investors understand the tech and nobody really can predict what the market for it will be 1, 5, 10, or 20 years from now.

How many open channels will the average person using bitcoin on a regular basis have? Will I have one for the grocery store, cable bill, every retail store, online stores, etc? That’s essentially like having a separate bank account for each of those things, it’s a lot to manage. I’d like there to be a better solution but I haven’t heard LN described in a way that solves this problem.
