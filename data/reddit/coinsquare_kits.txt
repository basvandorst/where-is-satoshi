Sending out some kits now. [Take a look at our twitter for a picture of the kit.](
 Hope we can help you in the future!

check us out! we just launched 
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:23:39
You nailed it, iron-on-transfer process.
We'll add more information/images to the site to be more informative.
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-11-29 21:45:07
Yes, as said, this wasn't a BitPay issue.
It was our fault. BitPay has been great and we just fumbled.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:28:48
[No problem](
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:07:36
If you're looking for a cold storage solution, check out [Coinsquare](
We just launched. We offer kits that help you create custom etched cold storage wallets.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:13:36
Coming soon! Got a lot of requests today for a video.

Coinsquare checking in!
Hope we can help you with your storage needs.
Remember: You can etch any information you want on Coinsquares - both sides too.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:49:30
Yes, our employees are paid in bitcoin - though they're not forced to be.
Unfortunately, that is the only cost thus far that can be paid for - directly - with bitcoin.
However, as we grow we will push on our suppliers to start accepting BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-11 16:58:06
Coinsquare checking in.
FYI we keep a significant portion of our revenue in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:06:31
Yes, flat rate, but international shipping is more expensive.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:21:38

[Coinsquare will be having a Black Friday deal.](
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:30:54
20% off with discount code "BlockFriday"
@_date: 2014-12-01 06:44:08
Hey, check out your inbox. We sent you a PM.
Electrocution? If we had lawyers they'd probably say "yes". 
In reality? No. Our kit comes with a 9v battery. 
If you're concerned about your safety around a 9v battery Coinsquare kit isn't for you.
That's not sarcasm. Parents may not want small children or infants touching or licking a 9v battery.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:25:08
It's a dollar amount - not # of transactions.
There are several tiers requiring various levels of verification.
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:30:12
Great! We'll get that order out to you ASAP!
Etching alone works well, but adding paint and sanding just makes it that much clearer. 
It's not in our SOP - but you can do whatever you want. We view Coinsquare as more of a tool than a product.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:42:10
Normal Coinsquares are about 2" x 2"  (54.8 x 54.8 mm)
The Minis are 1.25" x 1.25" (=32 x 32 mm)
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:17:33
Added some pictures of the final product. Enjoy!
@_date: 2014-11-29 01:04:38
[....speaking of Black Friday.](
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:02:35
[The ol' work around.](
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:12:18
Noted! Apologies to all. Just trying to get the word out there. No spamming intended.
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:44:37
Agreed - well Coinsquare kits are physical. They come in all 3 spatial dimensions.
Depending how big your stocking is you may be able to stuff it in there, but we don't recommend it.
For those nerdy aunts and uncles out there, it's definitely a fun science-y activity for the nieces and nephews.
We'll be offering discounts and maybe some random prizes shipped with the kits -  Thursday through Sunday. How does that sound?
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:09:04
check us out! we just launched!
we supply you with everything you need to create a metal wallet at home. you don't need to send us anything... 
....except payment ;) 
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:06:57
Absolutely. We'll work on it!
@_date: 2014-11-29 08:01:34
Because BitPay is more seamless from a customer/user/website integration POV. They also add to the perception of legitimacy, which is hard to come by in the bitcoin world. 
And honestly, getting paid in dollars to cover costs is essential. Our supply chain still relies on dollars.
FYI we don't convert 100% of our revenue to dollars. We convert what we need to  in order to cover costs - then we keep the rest in bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:13:59
We're working on a video - many people have asked for one.
To answer your questions for now....
1) Laser jet or photocopier works best.
2) The image is ironed onto the metal with a normal clothing iron. The heat makes the transfer stick.
3) The kit does not come with a printer.
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:07:49

@_date: 2014-12-01 06:22:49
edit: We've done a 180. We're now offering free shipping on US orders.
~~Shipping is expensive! Especially at our relatively small volumes.~~
~~We could have hidden this cost in our prices, but then Americans would have been overpaying for the high cost of international shipping.~~ 
~~Another thing: It's a flat shipping fee, which means that if you want to add more kits or additional Coinsquares to your order you're not paying more for them (in hidden shipping costs)~~
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:36:33
Well hopefully we can help you out! Let us know if you have any questions.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:50:22
Just labor. As we grow we hope to convince our supply chain to accept BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-28 15:50:55
Use discount code "BlockFriday" at the checkout.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:43:26
:( You're not the first. Wont be the last. It's unfortunate, but we still like it.
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:11:24
[Yeah, check out the pictures on our twitter for finished examples](
There are no logos on either side. All of them come blank.
Durable? Certainly waterproof - they won't rust. They're flame proof, but probably won't survive several hundred degrees for hours. They'll survive any household pests - rats, mice and insects etc.
While developing the kit we experimented with caustic chemicals. Apart from being dangerous, we found they acid would eat through the mask leaving pock marks in the metal. That's what you're seeing in that photo you linked to. Our process is a little gentler.
Shipping is $10/order - 1 kit or 20, still $10.
There are no wet or hazardous products in our kits. We can ship internationally.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:22:28
Reposted with a link.
We apologize to our international customers, but we can't justify the same offer. Perhaps in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:43:06
10% off to the first 50 redditors! 
Use discount code "r/bitcoin" when checking out.
Yes, you can pay with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:12:47
We saw sales surge. We saw about 400% more sales yesterday than a normal day.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:39:46
We try! 
We're bitcoin enthusiasts with a background in product design and mechanical engineering. This is our contribution to the community. 
If you have any other suggestions/comments we're all ears.
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:26:36
It was our fault - we hadn't verified something.
BitPay is still great.
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:08:34
Update:  BitPay has raised our limits! We should be back to normal.
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:14:57
Correct. We will never know your keys - public or private.
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:11:56
Completely understandable.
However, we don't have copies of anything. We don't send you any keys and you don't send us any.
You create your keys at home and print them yourself.
@_date: 2014-11-20 23:56:04
When we launched a lot of visitors had questions about the process. Hopefully this clears up your questions!
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:59:44
Additional content incoming! [Take a look at our twitter for a picture of the kit.](
 
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:29:37
sure! if it can be displayed visually and you can print it onto a piece of paper, you can etch it onto a Coinsquare.
letters, numbers, QR codes - whatever.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:32:47
It would definitely be useful.
@_date: 2014-12-01 07:45:21
We underestimated international volume and thus higher than expected international shopping costs. Had to rejigger prices. Sorry :( but also...Thanks for buying!
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:43:43
What sounds good to you?
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:13:40
We have received a lot of feedback on this issue and we're working on a "How it Works" right now - stay tuned.
Brief summary of the process:
* Create your transfer image:QR code, text, etc
* Print it onto transfer paper (we supply transfer paper)
* Iron on your transfer image 
* Submerge your Coinsquare in a salt water bath (we supply battery + electrical connections)
* Let the image etch for 30 minutes
* Remove transfer mask with nail polish remover

@_date: 2015-01-17 20:08:43
True, but the real danger is not melting but oxidizing. The information on the etched surface may become corrupted by the high heat which accelerates oxidization - and that happens at temperatures much lower than melting temperature.
That's why steel fire pits don't melt but slowly rust into oblivion.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:46:34
cool idea. how much would they cost?
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:23:57
You could do that if you have the tech, however Coinsquare kits are just etching kits. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:00:37
We will keep adding more kits to the prize pool as more people enter. 
We're trying to keep the odds of winning to 1 in 20.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:44:59
It all depends how hot and how long the fire burns. Is it completely fireproof? No, nothing is. But it's certainly going to stand up to a flame.
It will survive where a paper wallet -  or even a Trezor - wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:11:27
Our kits come with 3 plates (and you can buy additional ones too). You can store your wallet in multiple places if you want.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:16:49
Nice! 
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:07:21
Obligatory plug: 
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:10:56
No, aluminum naturally forms a protective oxide layer very quickly which, ironically, prevents oxidization from continuing. Certain chemicals would probably eat away at the aluminum - for example, muriatic acid (what you put in pools). 
Don't spill high concentration, industrial strength acid on your Coinsquare and you should be good.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:21:44
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:23:17
Coinsquare kits are metal etching kits
@_date: 2014-11-29 17:56:55
Tell you what, if you can show us all the transactions we conducted yesterday we'll send you a kit on us.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:14:41

[Coinsquare]( are more fireproof than paper.  May not need a fireproof safe.
