I'm using BTC/USD chart. That's a good point that I hadn't considered. And yes, you make a good point about barchart not citing where they are getting their info from. They are definitely using BTCUSD though. Could barchart using futures account for a $1600 difference in 200DMA?

High five for civil internet discussion fellow Redditor. We have achieved what was once thought to be impossible. The mod gave me the suggestion for bitcoinmarkets after I posted this. I'll take future garbage and place it in that sub.

Hey guys! Rookie here, but I am wondering why the 200 MA I have set up on tradingview isn't lining up with [other sources online]( I tried setting it to the EMA and the WMA thinking that maybe Barchart was using those and not indicating it, but neither lined up either - and not just off by a few dollars, but by several thousand. Any help greatly appreciated. 
TL;DR: My 200MA = $9202 while another source puts the 200 MA at $7758. Why?

Thank you.

I guess barcharts is not correct. Something being incorrect based on a random google search just doesn't add up, though. /s
Just wanted to make sure I wasn't being an idiot and reading it completely wrong.

I am not here to argue the benefit or lack thereof of TA. I understand the arguments for and against it. I take an interest in learning new theoretical skills. This includes both TA and Fundamentals. I trade a bit here and there, but not with any significant amounts of money. I am here only to understand why my 200 DMA was not lining up with somebody else's. My question would have been the same for any other arbitrary number, such as the 163.5 DMA. I used the 200 DMA because it was more likely to answer my question than another arbitrary number. I appreciate your response, and I understand the point you are trying to make: TA is nonsensical.

Awesome, thanks for the suggestion.
