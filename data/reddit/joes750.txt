Has your family asked you about bitcoin since then?

I agree that it's not a bad idea to diversify. That was part of my point. Gottafly65 and jaber2 made it seem like it was only one way or the other. Sorry if I didn't make that clear in my earlier comment.
But I'm not sure whether splitting between only eth and btc can be said to be true diversity. They're both cryptocurrencies that use blockchain tech.
Take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt though. I'm no expert and I also have positions in both eth and btc. Maybe it's just about what you believe in.

This is cool stuff and I'm glad you brought it up. I'll have to do my own research, but thanks for giving some relatively in depth answers.

Most of them aren't even trying to hide either.  I'm reading the same comments across multiple threads, and I'm seeing users that are just variations on the same name

While you're not wrong, this is under the assumption that eth and btc will hit those values. Either one could go more or less by year end.
Edit: you also have to consider when you sell. If you're looking for a short term pump and dump this works, but either could stagnate and then jump up significantly.

Jesus fucking Christ 35 btc. My heart aches for you. I guess it was just the hard way to learn to get everything off of exchanges as soon as you can...
