This is where the analogy of Bitcoin being the TCP/IP layer of this new financial technology experiment comes in. TCP/IP just routes data packets to the correct computer on a network; HTTP is the protocol on top of TCP/IP that allows for a structured session of communication (e.g. with an "opening", "closing", and other phases of a particular session of interaction with a web application). So, in our analogy, new smart contract protocols can be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol just like HTTP layers on top of TCP/IP. This is what Counterparty has done.

I don't think you understand what [economic sanctions]( are. A lot of times countries imposing a sanction will require their domestic companies to halt financial transactions with the sanctioned country. So this not only affects the sanctioned government but also those of private players. There are a LOT of private interests that would not want to stop using the dollar.

Eh? Where in the world do you get that? They monetized this with an additional fee, theoretically obviating the need to sell client information. Because it's a dark pool, people won't see the transactions making front running not even applicable.

It will surge during increases in value until the fees adjust, then those who aren't interested in making only a measly handful of dollars after paying their power bill will drop out.

You can send a second transaction but it won't cancel the first, thus you are doing two separate spends using actually different funds tracked in the ledger, not an actual double spend where you replace the first transaction with another.

Blocks will never stop being mined. Block rewards will be supplanted by transaction fees. By then the user base will be much higher and the number of transactions will have gone up dramatically. The rise in transaction fees should more than make up for the loss of a block reward. The block reward was just a bootstrapping mechanism to create initial scarcity and provide a basis for value.

Um, no. If it were that easy then there would be no revolution in decentralized digital security. Anybody would be able to double spend regardless of hashing power.
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:59:40
The inputs and outputs are known even if they aren't mined. A second transaction with the same inputs but different outputs will not be included if its timestamp is after the first. That's the protocols basic level of protection and why double spends require either huge hashing power or for you to control how the transaction propagates across the network. Both transactions will be propagated and the second will be rejected by the network because it is smart enough to know that it would result in non sufficient funds.

@_date: 2014-01-29 15:56:54
The likelihood of a successful double spend depends on how much of the network is under control of the fraudster. In order to have a high chance of a successful double spend, you'd have to spend a lot of money acquiring the necessary hashing power. So, while you could spend the money to buy 40% of the network so that you could get a free coffee every other day, you probably won't spend your resources that way. Given how large the network is now, the cost sink required makes it a bad business decision to try and spoof the network this way.

It's been pointed out already, but I just really want to drive it home: a 51% attack does not let the attacker spend anybody else's funds.

Because a block contains many more than one transaction, each individual transaction fee does not have to be equal to a mined block. I mean, the reward has already halved from 50 to 25 bitcoins. Do you pay 25 bitcoins per transaction? No, that's ridiculous.
As time marches on the idea is to have an increased user base. An increased user base means more transactions, which of course equals more transaction fees. So, as the block reward is reduced, the number of transactions and so fees collected goes up, offsetting the reduced reward. Depending on adoption, the rise in the number of transaction fees could award a greater value than the block reward would ever have produced; while each transaction fee required per transaction could be dramatically reduced at the same time.

For Coinbase or Circle?
I've not used Circle, but from what I hear they are instant.
Coinbase allows for instant buys up to a certain limit for verified accounts. I think the top limit is something like 10btc. That's a cumulative amount over one month, so if you by 1btc instantly on the first, you can only buy another 9btc instantly over the course of the next month (until the first of the next month). So, it's not instant over that amount or if you don't have a bank account verified. For the latter instances you have to wait roughly 4 business days; the price is locked in at the time you initiate the buy, however, so there's no risk of losing out on price changes.

According to there's something of a paywall, so here's the body of the article:
Here’s a thought to kindle a lovely warm glow of smugness and schadenfreude as we enter a new year: you didn’t lose your fortune in the great bitcoin bubble of 2013.
The reason I know you didn’t is because few Speccie-reading types of my acquaintance even understand what a bitcoin is, let alone how you might go about buying one, or why it might be important for the future of everything. So let me try to explain from the perspective of a fellow Luddite and techno-phobe.
You think about bitcoin, if at all, as one of those newfangled things that young people and child pornographers and hackers and other unsavoury types indulge in. It’s good for a blackly funny story — like the one about the Welshman who lost £4 million worth of bitcoin on his computer hard drive in a rubbish tip. But it’s not something you need to get involved with emotionally, let alone physically, because you don’t need to buy your drugs from the Silk Road, when there’s perfectly decent claret to be had online legally from Berry Bros. and Rudd.
Up to this point, I’d agree that your analysis is more or less right. And we haven’t even factored all the other reasons why you might want to avoid bitcoin — and its junior cryptocurrencies, such as Litecoin and Quark — like the plague. These include: the tremendous fiddle of buying the things; how pretty useless they are when you’ve acquired them; how hard they are to get rid of when the price starts plummeting; how vulnerable they are to theft by hackers; and the possibility that the authorities might suddenly clamp down on cryptocurrencies, as they have in China.
It’s the last one, for me, that represents the biggest long-term risk. That’s because, as Max Keiser puts it, bitcoin is the ‘currency of the resistance’. To put it in Star Wars terms, dollars, pounds, euros, renminbi and other ‘fiat currencies’ are what Darth Vader and co use on the Death Star and throughout their evil empire. But when Luke Skywalker and Han Solo and Princess Leia want to purchase more X-wing fighters or buy a round in the cantina, they pay in cryptocurrencies outside the enemy’s control.
Max Keiser, by the way, is that weird, brassy American in red braces — a bit like the Penguin from the 1960s Batman series — who was on Have I Got News For You a few weeks ago. He presents an increasingly popular TV show for Russia Today called Keiser Report, in which he talks darkly and conspiratorially about banksters and gold price manipulation and the imminent collapse of the corrupt global financial system. Probably that puts you off as much as that Star Wars analogy did. But the scary thing you need to ask yourself at this point is: what if Max Keiser is right?
Here are some questions to help you on your way. 1. Do you believe that a Chancellor who, despite talk of austerity, is still borrowing £100 billion a year is in any way serious about cutting Britain’s epic national debt? 2. And suppose Miliband and Balls were to get in in 2015, do you think this would usher in a new golden era of fiscal responsibility? 3. Either way, what do you think is going to happen to the economy, house prices, public services, law and order etc when interest rates resume their natural level? 4. Looking around the world, do you see any evidence anywhere that speech is getting freer, economies are becoming less constrained, taxed and regulated, markets less blatantly rigged and manipulated, the banker/corporatist/lawyer class less bloated and cushioned, fiat currencies less inflated, resources more sensibly allocated?
You don’t need to be a particularly virulent pessimist to notice something phoney about this glorious economic recovery we’re supposedly experiencing. All you need to understand is that since the 2008 crash, nothing has been done to address the terrifying underlying problem that got us there: governments — our government especially, since we are one of the most indebted in the western world — are spending far too much money we haven’t got on crap (from overgenerous welfare to HS2) we can’t afford. This can only end very, very nastily.
So what possible recourse do we free (ish) individuals have against the bullying might of this vast, increasingly confiscatory system stacked against us? Well this is where bitcoins, Litecoins and Quarks et al come in. They’re the monetary equivalent of that scene in Atlas Shrugged where the productive, hardworking creators revolt against the corrupt, hyper-regulated, sclerotic, wasteful, doomed system and retreat beyond the mountains to Colorado.
Cryptocurrencies were created by and for people who have simply had enough. They’ve seen the way the world is going and rather than grumble or pretend it’s not happening, they’ve decided instead to make a new one, in their own liberty-loving image. It’s a world where, by and large, Big Brother has no place — which is why, for example, it’s so popular on the black market.
But you don’t need to be a crim to see why cryptocurrencies make sense. Have you noticed how increasingly difficult it is, for example, to conduct the most basic transactions from your bank account? You want to pay for some item, perhaps by bank transfer, and the security’s so tight (thanks to onion layers of EU regulation, probably) you sometimes find yourself being shut out of your own account. Well, with bitcoin you’re your own bank: you transfer your money electronically from your wallet to the payee’s wallet, and that’s it.
Oh, and another thing. And this may be the clincher: the number of retail outlets which accept bitcoin is exploding, with thousands more each week. For example, already there’s a delightful agriturismo farmhouse in Tuscany, a place by a lake in Portugal, an apartment in Dubrovnik. Paying for these in BTC is like spending Monopoly money, like you’re getting your pleasures free.

As a godless libertarian socialist I can say that you are utterly talking out of your ass.
Do you think it's deflationary policy that is allowing for the numerous fronts American soldiers keep getting dumped on to?
How does deflation require more resources than it has? I guess you're trying to say that it values a growing economy more than an inflationary bias does because that's the only way to see its value per unit grow. However, it seems precisely the opposite in reality as a constant value is much easier to predict than the *inherent need* of a growing economy required by an inflationary monetary policy.
On your point about the cold war: they didn't print money because of the need to fund gaurds they had already hired, the printed money to hire more guards than they could have otherwise afforded.
You are performing an exercise in doublethink so advanced that I imagine you must be intentional in your intellectual dishonesty here.

Only if your contacting nodes that are far apart. If not, then the first transaction will propagate ahead of the first and the second transaction will not be accepted into blocks.

That's facile. The easiest place to buy bitcoins is on exchanges, but the exchanges do not hold anything close to all bitcoins in circulation. So, after sky rocketing the price gutting the bit of liquidity on all exchanges globally, how easy do you think it will be to clean out hedge funds, margins, etc?
It's not that easy. As they buy they'll drive up their own price, so just looking at the current marketcap tells you very little about how much they'd have to spend to acquire all bitcoins; they would have to spend much, much more to get them all.

Someone from Coinbase posted this four days ago: [PSA limit change for instant buys on Coinbase](


We originally set the instant buy limit to 10 BTC/day when this was a relatively small amount of money. This has quickly grown. And taking a step back, our goal with instant buys was to facilitate payments in bitcoin where you needed them right away to make a purchase with a merchant. At this point, it's rare for someone to need close to $10,000 for a quick purchase online, and the fraud risk is substantially greater for us on instant buys.

Only if it brings down hashing power. Considering how small Bitcoin is, there's plenty of room for growth even if blocksize is increased. Plenty more nodes will come online if adoption grows. Crippling adoption because use cases are cut prematurely is myopic and short sighted.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:10:08


Why is this considered a good response? It's at best half baked if not down right intellectually dishonest.
Yes, fees have to be high enough to incentivize miners. However, if you have more transactions, fees don't need to be as high to create that incentive.
100 transactions * $5 transaction fee = $500
1000 transactions * $1 transaction fee =$1000
Raising the block size to accommodate more transactions keeps fees lower and allows for more use cases, which brings more users. Higher transaction fees means less users because it accommodates fewer use cases.
Why are people pushing for high transaction fees that will discourage use when Bitcoin is still very small potatoes compared to other networks?

That you have limited your imagination to a single use case simply reveals your own lack of imagination. There's also the ability to do smart contracts.

One of them *can be* the creation of digital good that is also scarce and can be transmitted anywhere. Stopping there, though, is a strange artificial limitation on imagination. There are many benefits of blockchains that extend beyond that depending on your use case, such as global timestamping.

You completely misunderstand this and it renders your critique entirely invalid as inapplicable. These chains aren't designed to have value transmitted with them. They're not monetary in nature.

Suppose you want all of the advantages of Storj but don't want to participate in the global open system. Why wouldn't you use a private blockchain for such an effort?
More importantly, what if you want the advantages of a blockchain but it's such a niche personal problem that you can't get the public to bootstrap it or seriously secure the chain? Why wouldn't you roll a homegrown private solution?

The wrinkle is that nodes, both full and lite, will broadcast transactions from both forks, meaning that even with great marketing payments will be fairly likely to not go to the new fork, leaving these merchants without payment even from those that want to buy from them. This malicious oligarchy could  make changes to the protocol around transaction verification. If they do change the protocol around what is a valid transaction, then they have to create new wallet software and convince users to switch just to make purchases from them.
If there really was a fork like this, it would be terrible for all players including malicious actors. It's unlikely that anyone other than someone who is willing to bury their assets with Bitcoin as they take it down will choose to fork the protocol like this. This is one of the reasons why a decentralized solution was sought.

I would say that is only fair if Bitcoin were a club with charter delineating rules for its members. Thus, those who joined the club would be voluntarily accepting these rules; as such, it would be justifiable for the club to enforce that charter by whatever means agreed to by the member. However, bitcoin is not a club; it is a loose federation joined by a particular technology.
If you don't want to trade funds with someone, then don't. Campaign to convince me that I shouldn't trade with that individual if you like, you may convince me. However, stopping me from trading with someone with whom I wish to trade because the majority says so is simply stupid.

While the depreciation by inflation of the dollar could be translating into part of the increase of the value of Bitcoin, this rise is almost certainly due to speculative pressure. That pressure is causing the value of Bitcoin to rise far faster than the value of the dollar is being inflated away. There's every reason to be concerned about the dollar, but it's not because of this current rise in the price of Bitcoin.

This is the bootstrapping phase and as the phrase implies, it's paradoxical. You have a commodity that you want to use as a currency but nobody values so nobody uses it as a medium of exchange (currency); there's potential though, so speculators begin trading it on that potential, giving it value; as this value begins to be seen, some brave entrepreneurs begin accepting it as a medium of exchange, giving legitimacy to that perception of value; more speculation; at this stage, the infrastructure evolving around it will be the choke point, as we're seeing now, and kinks in that will reflect in the price of the underlying commodity.
In short, as the market cap grows, these price swings will dwindle. Bitcoin is acting as a great commodity and is gaining as a currency, but it's a long way off from being used as a unit of account, aka prices being denominated in the currency's unit (as money = store of value + currency + unit of account)

Imagine the bitcoin forex market as a shallow puddle right now. Someone coming in with a shovel can cause major waves in that puddle.
Market cap growth is the equivalent of adding water to the puddle. As the puddle becomes a pond, then becomes a pool, then a lake, then a bay, then an ocean. To make the same kind of splashes in a pool as you did in a puddle would require a wheelbarrow; in a lake, something much larger. At the level of an ocean (aka a truly liquid market with trillions of dollars and the associated depth), trading billions of dollars of value will only move the price slightly.
For instance, look at how much value is swapped around using gold today. In that time, it's taken 10 mths to drop 17% (or so I read in an article today).

As I said, if people need to pay taxes in fiat, then bitcoin may never become the preferred unit of account as you'd have to know what the government expects you to give them in the form of legal tender. However, if bitcoin becomes stable in price and is the preferred currency, there's every reason for people to start pegging their prices to bitcoin. We'll probably see this in black and gray markets at the very least. But you're right about the domino effect, it probably won't happen as long as taxes must be paid with government paper.

Transaction fees are voluntary, so they may go up or they may go down.
As the network grows, more transactions are vying to be included in the next block; the higher the transaction fee, the more likely they'll be included. This could, in theory, make it so that miners are making more than they are now. Of course, this means that more miners are incentivized to join the network, which will bring the reward per miner down. If that dips below profitability, miners will leave, raising the reward again.
All in all, the dynamic reward structure of mining will probably keep it at a point where it is marginally profitable to do so, but not very much. Hobby miners will not be able to do that as their sole means of income.

The difficulty changes with the computing power of the network, meaning that it not only goes up when the power does, but also down if power leaves; this is done such that a block will be discovered about every 10 minutes regardless of how much computing power is on the network.

No way of knowing. Probably online goods though given the nature of digital currency, if I had to make a wild guess.


This is part of the paradoxical nature of bootstrapping a money like bitcoins. People will not simply adopt a new unit of account unless it is more convenient to get and use than the prevailing current unit of account; bitcoins fail miserably on this count right now. So, like any money, attention is drawn by its acting as a store of value in the form of a commodity, which incentivizes people to put out that extra effort. The gains seen in this store of value is what will attract merchants to accept it as a currency. However, given the natural volitility of this bootstrapping phase, it pretty much makes it impossible to use as a unit of account. Until the whole thing matures much, much more, you can't help but express bitcoins by their conversion factor because it is not yet the base unit of account.
TL;DR Just hold on, it will come eventually as long as something better than Bitcoin doesn't come along first :)

If you already had USD, why would you go through the trouble to convert to a currency that is on parity with it by design? Not only would you be adding hassle in the form of carrying out the exchange of currency, but you'd probably lose purchasing power due to fees.
Regarding volatility, that's why services like Bitpay exist; it removes all of the risk of volatility while allowing those who wish to transact in bitcoins to do so, thus attracting customers to those retailers. Bitpay is for the most part a transition provider, by which I mean that they exist in a narrow gap and time to facilitate the adoption of Bitcoin. There may be a place for them for a long while yet while taxes keep government fiat in vogue by force, but in theory they will become obsolete once Bitcoin has been heavily adopted.

Of course. But then, how do you imagine gold was valued when it first *began to emerge* as a currency?
People grumbling about how bitcoins are not acting like a fully mature currency have obviously missed the fact that bitcoins are, at best, in the late infant stages of being a money (of which acting as a currency is only a part).

@_date: 2013-12-06 04:34:52
Yes, by capturing more value (expressed as a rising "market cap").
At this stage, with its scarce supply, it is not terribly useful as a currency, and it cannot be. The price must *necessarily* rise in these fits and starts as new markets are penetrated and then saturated. Once enough value has been captured, new markets become smaller relatively speaking and the actions of single actors diminish further and further in significance; this is expressed as a more stable price.

@_date: 2013-07-31 19:42:45
An increase in the value of bitcoins is reflected in a lowering of the prices of goods. Considering that the number of transactions goes up when the price of bitcoin goes up (I'd link to some blockchain.info charts if it wasn't filtered at my work), you'd see that same behavior. In fact, dropping prices are just what's needed to get spending going again. The idea that people will "hoard" their money, especially during harder economic times, is as silly as saying nobody will ever buy a computer because if they wait they can get the same or better later.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:54:35
Should the price get that high, then in all likelihood the adoption by end retailers has also skyrocketed, meaning that a significant and healthy portion of the populace is using it. They'll know how many nano bitcoins products are being sold for; as this will also be in the future when the rest of the economy has also matured, there will probably be crazy easy ways to exchange currencies that will probably be transparent for end users. So, if there is a significant savings to be had by using bitcoins, a quick and painless (and possibly transparent) conversion will take place.
Basically, at that point people will be converting into bitcoin because it will be easier to use bitcoin than vice versa, an inversion of the situation we have at the moment.

I think the biggest contributing fact is that most people who use Bitcoin are biased toward open source software (myself being very much in that camp). Ripple, though they say they intend to release the source eventually (soon?), is currently not open. That sticks in the craw of a lot of Bitcoin users.
Second, a lot of people do not like how the creators have held onto a significant chunk of ripples to hand out at their discretion, meaning perhaps they won't much at all until the potential currency gains a lot of value.

Personally, I think we're seeing price discovery and a massive injection of liquidity into the Bitcoin economy

"How do we accomplish this with Bitcoin?"
The very general abstract problem you've stated breaks down in a hydra of concrete problems on several fronts, some more technical, others more social, still others made more difficult by intra-/international politics, etc.
The wonderful thing is that [your very general abstract problem has been identified several times]( along with many of the concrete ones.
This community is aware. There are threads about it all over this subreddit as well as other forums and communities.

If you're not too concerned about how the exact price you buy at, you can do this at [Coinbase]( Despite the bad stories you hear around this subreddit sometimes I've never had a problem with them beyond hitting their 24hr rolling limit. If you keep trying periodically, you can usually get through in a few hours.

The idea is that as Bitcoin catches on and transaction volume increases, that increase will allow transaction fees to remain low. According to [Blockchain.info]( there were 56,723 over the last 24 hours. 1.45% of the revenue was from fees. Now, imagine when there are that many transactions in minute. 
56,732 * 60 * 24 = 81,681,120 transactions every day
That's a lot of transaction fees to sweep up :)
