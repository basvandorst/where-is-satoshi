Annoying yes, but our goal is the same. Don't you want the price to go higher? Tell people to buy the dip!

A chat that cannot be censored... This is pretty dope. Free speech guys! It's back again!

Nice, this gives people the options to become holders easier. Users will probably have to provide their  deposit address for alibaba/lolli, so the company will have your name and deposit address and will store it.

Nice vid so far. It's  kinda cool to see how others are using bitcoin in tough times.
@_date: 2019-11-27 20:09:30
Ya who did you talk to about bitcoin? Clearly the person was comfortable enough, and had the knowledge to transfer money to another wallet. The culprit is likely someone you know. Anyway to see the address it was sent to?

Already bought the dip with half of what I'm allowed to use. Waiting for the 2nd dip that usually happens with my luck.

This is what the banks get for all those overdraft fees! This is going to be glorious.

4 inches? What a beast!

Gold? I don't want to deal with the physical ownership and hassle. Bitcoin is king baby, watch us overshadow the gold price.

The miner I was using stopped being profitable, so I haven't been mining for a while now. Someone else might have better info for you. Happy mining comrade~ reminds me of good old times with loud fans.

Catchup USA! We need something like this now! What's the holdup?
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:22:23
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:50:18
2nd rule is buy a hardware wallet such as trezor or ledger. Don't play around..
@_date: 2019-08-09 18:49:07
HODL is the only rule you need. This is your new savings account comrades.
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:37:48
Ya, where moon?
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:15:05
The first thing I would worry about is people claiming they are trying to help. Make sure their intentions are good otherwise it can be anyone waiting to take advantage of your kindness and more importantly, your bitcoin.

Slush wasn't so bad.
@_date: 2019-08-10 16:46:36
 don't forget Kevin is a tool for lying and pretending he doesn't know anything about bitcoin when he actually spoke positively about it back in 2013.
@_date: 2019-10-14 04:12:48
He is trolling. People always make up reasons for price fluctuations. Just laugh and upvote. ��
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:59:41

@_date: 2019-08-09 19:23:39

Hey James get off reddit and make this right. Stop dropping the BALL! don't use bitpay ever people.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:58:45
Holy crap that guy got showed! Can't wait to tell my wife about this savageness I saw online!
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:39:56
Have you been able to see any confirmations?
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:12:23
Just buy 100 bucks at a time throughout the day untill you are done buying as much as you're comfortable with homie.
@_date: 2019-12-31 19:57:24

Dude! That's dope! Feel proud! Are you a fan of dbz bro?
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:27:05
Don't put up with this bull. I'm sure you won't be using binance again, and based on what Ive seen today neither will I. They can shove their questions up their ass.
@_date: 2019-12-10 22:40:27
I wouldn't worry about them charging a subscription, implementing this wouldn't be easy and they would ruin their credibility. Plus their rival will slaughter the competition. Nobody will pay a monthly fee if the other hardware wallet option is free.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:08:06
This is normal don't stress! If anything keep stacking. I was happy to be able to buy at 8000 not long ago. Who knows when we will see prices like this again.
@_date: 2019-09-11 14:50:01
Ya, seriously? Don't use bitpay and send those sweet satoshis over
