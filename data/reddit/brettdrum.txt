I am here to tell people my opinion. If you are here to buy Bitcoin, then you are in the wrong place. I don't know why I have 0 post karma but I have just checked and apparently its because I've not been upvoted yet. Will you upvote me to try and fix that? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:27:18
what do you think of my graph ? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:59:23
No I’m saying there is a very fast growing pool of cryptos and they are all pretty similar . 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:02:46
My argument is that cryptos , specifically Bitcoin are worth zero and you will only get more than you paid ( the only reason people buy them if they are honest ) if two other fools buy them after you do :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:09:47
I'm sure you don't like it , why would you ?  Do you think I would think bitcoin was a pyramid scheme that is going to crash if i smoked crack ? Can't see the connection . 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:10:13
When it gets to those levels you will not feel like buying anymore . 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:38:44
a great response that reminds me how the whole world of Crypto is infested with people who don't really know what they are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:00:44
Bitconnect equals bitcoin because it's an opportunistic project that requires the "no middleman" movement of money to do its evil deeds. Bitcoin, and more specifically crypto,  is riddled with illegal business, hidden money, fraud, deception and tax evasion and thats why governments and banks don't encourage it. Furthermore, they don't want innocent people like you losing all your money through greed or stupidity. The US Dollar has value because over the years we have all bought into it and vote for it with our actions (Try using bartering to buy a car). Of course, dollars are used for illegal activities and all these things but once it's a large amount it has to go through banks and becomes controlled.  Bitcoin has no value unless some other fool buys one after you buy it.. the pure definition of a pyramid scheme. FOMO and Greed plus Libertarianism =the perfect storm ...DOTN HODL :)

I am not a believer in gold and don’t find it as fascinating as bitcoin , that is why I am here . I have watched Bitcoin since $200 and have never believed in it so have never invested . I am fascinated by the perfect storm it created between people who can’t make money in the system and regular human greed and FOMO . It’s all about a quick buck which we all enjoy and eventually all the hodl’ers will reluctantly admit when their big revolution they claim to be part of returns them 1 % of their “investment”. PS glad I made you laugh your ass off and brought a little joy to the world .

what a mishmash of nonsense
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:05:30
some more greats points and a few mistakes.  The reason bitcoin is not limited is that the whole barrier to entry for cryptos in general is tiny and therefore bitcoin, as one of them becomes less rare too. There is in fact a glut of cryptos and Bitcoin is actually one of the least practical and most expensive. Bitcoin itself has forked and could do so again ... Crypto coins are not rare at all. It is just semantics that I say "it will do this or that" because I am not claiming that I know it will do anything, I am suggesting what I think it will do ... That should be obvious to you. It's not a sad hobby, I enjoy researching and debating on many topics and that all adds to my understanding of the world and my opinion as a futurist. 
OK you got me that I said I might buy the dead cat bounce where before I said I'd not buy it so to be clear, I would never be Long Bitcoin but might take an opportunistic punt if there was a very extreme capitulation that looked like it was inviting a bounce. even that trade for me is unlikely because when that happens the drop will be so fast that it will be a bit too exciting for me.  I was tempted to buy at $300 and watched it all the way, but I don't regret my choices because I made them based on my understanding all the way up to $19,000 and back down.  I really have no fear that others will benefit and as I've said before I do believe the "quick buck" phase ended in December. I get how people believe in Cryptos and my investigation is around how the Libertarian thinking combined with FOMO , Fear hope and greed as well as a good dose of delusion about how the financial world works has spawned a pyramid scheme that has exploded like the perfect storm ... its not too late for you either :) DOTN HODL 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:19:12
Presumably, everyone who has invested in BTC and is HODLing intends to exit eventually right?  Well make sure that you exit first or all your HODL Besties will leave with your cash :( 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:52:13
Thanks . I appreciate your warm response, but I just don’t believe bitcoin will have much value in future . It might go back to $10,000 or above for a moment but eventually I think it’s on its way to whatever it will be worth when it is 100% hodlers who won’t sell ( probably $300) . PS I’ve missed many boats ( not trains :) and caught many too , but this boat I think will be the titanic and I’m happy to have missed it :) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:18:28
You tell them !!!
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:47:45
Well, you said by my logic Facebook is worthless and a pyramid scheme. Does Facebook exist purely as a  form of investment in which each paying participant requires further participants to join in, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones?  That's why. By the way, even though bitcoin is "caped" as you put it,  it WAS forked so they did let that happen ... have you not heard of Bitcoin cash? 
Anyway, I think we've said enough and remember that calling someone a moron tells people more about you than the person you think you are insulting.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:59:49
you cant HODL currency .... you have to choose: bitcoin is either an investment or a currency. However, as an investment it's a disaster ... Its true value is Zero as it does nothing. Governments won't be laughed at as criminals and secret money try and use it as their bank account. Its rotten to the core with scams like bitconnect and 90% of the cryptocurrencies . DOTN HODL ... check out my graph which captures the silliness of it perfectly .
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:03:24
laughing your ass off will not help you . I do understand this "space" and this technology and your condescending comment suggests that you have some kind of inside knowledge that I don't have. What would that be ?
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:13:30
If I invested on the basis of this type of guidance I would probably not have done as well. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:25:56
Bet you they would !
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:20:40
Thanks ... I appreciate your feedback :) However I'm not trying to understand anything, I am making a statement about my position on Bitcoin which is that it is a pyramid scheme and will go back to zero, but on the way there a lot of people who have drunk the HODL kool aid will lose a lot of money ... 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:55:55
I spread Uncertainty and Doubt ( I have no fear and if you didn't buy btc nor would you)  because I think its a pyramid scheme which I dislike ethically . I've informed myself enough to know what I know. I'm not catching any dip. The time to make money from Bitcoin was up till December last year and now its over. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:57:46
People with common sense in the crypto game are not my inspiration. I'm not looking for a connection between writing about bitcoin on Redditt and smoking Crack, it is you who made the ridiculous connection. Facepalm :) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:55:58
Great response and excellent point, however it still is a store of value because all that those other metals are quite rare. Don’t get me wrong , diamonds and gold are not as rare as one would think and that is manipulated by their industries and I’m not a believer in either . ( I don’t buy gold and bought one diamond because I drank the engagement ring Kool aid along with everyone else) . My argument still stands that cryptos are by definition not rare because you can just create them and as you know Bitcoin Represents a smaller and smaller slice of the whole. I just don’t believe in Bitcoin as store of value or as currency (people don’t just hodl currencies , that would be absurd) . I also think the crypto idea is a perfect synergy between human greed and libertarian anti establishment thinking which spawned the whole toxic hodl concept . Dotn hodl :) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:23:40
A brilliant counter argument but would you rather have a gold coin or a coin made of chocolate ? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:25:26
Some great responses thanks . It’s a good argument that other metals means gold is less rare and I concede ... but how much less rare ? ... add all the platinum and silver etc together and it’s probably a factor of 10....cryptos can be forked INFINITELY . Dotn Hodl folks and this graph will tell u why ... 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:58:06
If you read peoples' messages you will be able to work out what they are on about. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:39:13
Again you missed my point I'm afraid which is that the whole crypto concept deceptively creates an illusion of scarcity for each individual coin but overall is limiteless since anyone can just spawn a new coin in days. (Even bitcoin itself can continue forking into lots of parts) That is not why inflation was created either and I never claimed gold is an effective currency anymore. Time will tell whether cypto is a revolution that will defeat governments and banks FIAT currencies or an experiment that evolved into a huge pyramid scheme built on greed and delusion about another new world order.  DOTN HODL 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:01:11
Of course I am biased ... just like you , and I am specifically negative about bitcoin which I think is a pyramid scheme . I also literally could not care any less about how much Reddit Comment Karma I have :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:04:55
Im not "pumping alt" and calling everyone who disagrees with you a shill is really stupid . 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:59:17
  this captures  it perfectly in my opinion ... please tell me what you think of my graph . 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:14:09
Not a good analogy at all 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:52:38
Literally not one smart response to my point. People always ask me if I'm "new" to the space as if they are some kind of financial wizard. I'm as new as all of you but I don't believe in crypto. I promote FUD because I don't believe Bitcoin is a currency (too slow, too volatile, too unsafe, hardly accepted anywhere) and as an investment, it is 100% pyramid since it has zero value unless two fools enter after you did and pay more. Also make sure you agree with all your HODL besties that unless you are donating your money to the Bitcoin concept and intend on exiting EVENTUALLY , that they let you out  FIRST because otherwise, you'll end up with nothing because they took it all and won't be your besties anymore :( 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:48:42
make no mistake, all the people telling you to HODL sold coins all the way up and used YOUR cash to buy ipads and cars . They only want you to hodl to protect what they have left on the table ... DOTN HODL folks , bitcoin has no actual value

Now that's a proper answer, thanks .. I appreciate your effort and insight.  Yes, you are right that part of my fascination is a symptom of my watching Bitcoin from $200 to $20,000 and missing out on that, but I have the same fascination with Tech stocks and have not missed out on them at all. It's not a stupid thing to say that I have informed myself enough because I really understand it enough to take a position. I don't think Satoshi Nakamoto knows where this is going or predicted its behaviour. In the end, everyone must make a decision about what they think it will do and place bets accordingly.  By the way, although one can't ignore crypto one can definitely avoid it like the plague as a "store of value" which is me. I will not regret not buying today as I don't regret not buying 2 years ago because I know what it saw and felt like then and chose not to buy on that basis. Its easy in retrospect to say you would have bought as it is to say you will buy when it hits $1,000... but when it hits $1,000 you will not be as keen :)  What I say to you as a final point is that all the people HODL'ing will turn against each other when the time comes to exit as the last half out get nothing :) I am here spreading UD as a hobby . I have a big life and don't need to invest in Bitcoin for my future ... I also hope you don't look back at these days with regret as I promise you I will definitely not have any regrets about my decision to not buy Bitcoin no matter what it does and you know what I think its going to do. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:20:08
I like "chiming in" on things generally and do understand it, but don't believe in it and furthermore, I should be less embarrassed by the "look" that I have created than the one that you are busy creating.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:28:42
A compelling response that I literally can’t beat in terms of its supporting my argument 
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:03:31
I do like understanding things ...I'm not a buyer or seller of crypto but I am fascinated by human nature and all the dumb things we do :) ... Dotn Hodl :)

Thanks grandson , I don’t have any gold coins and won’t get any, but by the time you are a grandfather (which I’m not) you would prefer a handful of shiny gold coins instead of a $1 bitcoin . 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:43:45
sort of ... but if bitcoin implodes they MIGHT ...thats what I said. However they will never be an investment, simply a practical tool .
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:10:33
such a good argument. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:01:26
saying "are you new to this market" ? is condesending and suggests that you are a wise experienced sage . The whole thing is new and your 1 year of experience is worth nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:59:51
Yes I do , but probably not from you . 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:33:14
The interesting thing about this bitcoin phenomenon is that it's an instrument based PURELY on supply and demand with absolutely nothing else behind it.(the true definition of a pyramid scheme)  Bitcoin does nothing. Don't tell me its a currency, it's too volatile for that. Governments aren't going to sit by while we create a secret bank account for everyone. It's really a scam and the people who started the HODL virus (hold no matter what)  got in for a quick buck and their only chance of that quick buck was you spreading the HODL idea. I see it going below $1000 in the next few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:43:51
Thanks , good response and well done for taking money off the table . I totally understand the structure of the limited BTC and am just making the point that crypto in general is incredibly non rare ... Of course People made a lot of money on it and I have nothing to win or lose but enjoy debating and still believe it’s eventually inevitably worthless . What you are doing is holding ... hodling asks you to not cash in and “spend on stuff” which is kind of cynical and sneaky since most hodlers sold plenty from your contribution:) ps good luck :) 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:57:06
I certainly don't wish for anything . I believe they will all crash and when they are a few cents each then they might have a functionality but will never be growing investments.

@_date: 2018-02-06 10:02:27
Sorry I'm busy that day ... Why don't you set your crypto app to text you when BTC gets to $800 which will be in around a month :)... I don't mean to be nasty, I just really feel bad for all the poor HODLers who's gurus have already sold.
