Everything will be clear on the 29th.

Oh geez. This guy again? He's making quite a ruckus. It's a bummer he fell for a phishing scam, but it's crazy how many people on here didn't bother to read your comment and think his issue is legit.

That's when the NY Judge decides to throw out the case against Tether or let the NY AG continue with the case.
Amy Castor provides a pretty good history of events:

When he says “return to the days of many currencies,” I don’t think people actually understand what he means. You can look up the number of years it took to happen, but the USG shut them all down; that is what he is referring to...

Two words: dark pools.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:01:06
buy buy buy buy buy!
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:03:32
Yeah, I don't understand why more people in the crypto world don't realize that the USD is backed by something very real: violence.
@_date: 2018-09-27 01:01:52
I think his implication was that they were thinking 70 years ahead. It is said that these guys think in terms of 100 and 1,000 year time frames.
@_date: 2018-09-27 02:02:14
Bitcoin needs to come down to around $500 before they can build up their positions to what they want....then it will get approval.
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:27:25
Look at the architecture of it. As the blockchain grows, the only people who can afford to run huge server farms are state level actors. So I don't think they are too worried.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:35:37
These guys haven’t attracted any institutional buyers. So it tells me this is just a retail scam.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:26:46
Lol probably best not to rip off a corporate clothing logo.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:19:18
I remember seeing t-shirts with it on them back in the early 90's.
@_date: 2019-08-07 21:09:43
I find this hard to believe. If they restart QE the S&amp;P 500 will go to the moon. BTC will take another 3 years at least in that case.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:30:01
Lol. What this guy is really saying is that they can paint the tape any way they want and fill in a story later. The big guys collude to build their positions over years and then support the pullbacks so that they can sell into the rallies.
@_date: 2019-08-22 16:11:50
You all have to dig a lot deeper to find out what is really going on with it.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:18:39
Yeah lot of people never got past the first verification. Maybe they’re just a data collection project.
@_date: 2019-08-11 00:34:50
Not a legal issue, image is just associated with 14 year olds from 1994.
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:25:05
Yeah, it's funny how clueless people are to the magnitude of institutionally normalized criminal activity happening.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:53:07
Bitcoin has a high level of programmable smart contract features? I’m all for BTC but this isn’t accurate. Shouldn’t gold be “none”? How do you program gold? It says low so it must have SOME smart programability....???
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:00:41
Saying its programmable, but smart contracts are not really relevant is pedantic then. Just saying this isn’t the best of tables if you want to honestly extol the merits of Bitcoin. Gold has NO programmability, not low programmability.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:23:28
Lol they are gonna calculate the worst possible price to fill your order basically. If they were legit they’d just allow you to place a limit order at the bid or buy at the offer. Also could mean they don’t have access to decent liquidity.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:18:47
So he goes from adult man to baby over the word "bcash."
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:38:17
Agreed. There are many successful founders who could have been used in this graphic, rather than people who were doing pump and dumps and outright unregulated fraud. Anyone associated with tron in anyway has to be automatically discredited. Ten minutes of dd on them and you can find scandal after scandal.
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:14:56
What a chump.
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:18:39
Shouldn’t this be on the forum?
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:55:52
Fair point.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:56:22
Lol are you a comedian?!!
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:13:26
Wow, total trash tech. These central banks think they can compete with this garbage? No one with a brain wants this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:52:08
What a loser. You shouldn’t be allowed to teach economics until you’ve lost at least 20k trading in the real world.
@_date: 2019-10-08 01:01:16
Anytime you hear the words “pure play” in the investing space it means you should run very far from that company.

The male interviewer sounds like he has a mouth full of tobacco/chew.

There is a Zerohedge serial poster who is always using this phrase...I can only see the title at this point since he deleted the comment, but yea. Full faith and credit.

How do we know that we can have (institutional/complaint) custody over coins? This is a hard question? Are you guys rolling around laughing? There is no way he can possibly be genuine in this statement here. The lies are so blatant it is HILARIOUS.
@_date: 2019-09-30 01:23:19
What a pro.
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:09:33
Hey that’s a good idea. Binary options on their campaign promises. I think Augur might have some of these already.
@_date: 2018-12-22 16:53:49
And a lot of people would say stocks like Amazon are worth less than 25% of their ATH's.

A billionaire.
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:53:16
You know, except for creating several quadrillion in derivative debts and almost imploding the world's financial system..not reckless except for that.
@_date: 2018-12-09 04:27:37
All of humanity, living on the edge. Mother nature isn't our mother at all, but an endless, shifting, semi-silent mosaic of murderous eating cycles. *Everything eating everything*. Over 400 nuclear reactors, red hot. T.S. Eliot was wrong, it's not gonna end with a bang *or a whimper*, but a hard, grinding, empty melt up. Look at Venezuela's IBVC chart. They will print, print, print till those presses are red hot and the dead souls of biblical and literary scholars will watch in awe and see the karma of what their printing presses eventually created. So yea, long BTC, ETH, etc.
