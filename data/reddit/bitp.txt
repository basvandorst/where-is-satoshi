I feel like going potty. Can someone help me wipe my ass after?

You know who's getting desperate? Your mom. For a cock.

Damn it you upvoters! I deliberately made a shitty (pun intended) comment, so that people will downvote me and it will rise to the top. I even downvoted myself. I can't believe people are upvoting this comment!

Ever heard about network effect? Yes its easy to make a new sub, but its not that easy to get it going. Network effect is like monopoly, the same reason why USD and Bitcoin have value. Neither of them has a monopoly.

Lucky no one is talking about the blatant censorship. That would have really hurt Bitcoin's image. Lets keep the censorship under covers.
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:10:10
Not until the free discussion around the block size debate is highly censored (by deleting valid arguments that are against the mods' views) and manipulated (by changing default sorting of comments, hiding comment scores and disabling minimization of comments with lots of -ve votes.)

Its in the protocol to make mining totally fair. Since Satoshi was the only one who could have mined the genesis block, he made sure it is unspendable in the protocol. Also note that Satoshi had publicly declared the date and time the genesis block will be created, so mining was open to everyone. Anyone could have mined the 2nd block, and so on.

I thought altcoin discussion was banned in this subreddit?
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:32:52
They should be. Wikipedia is all about openness, and Bitcoin right now is one of the most censured things on Internet.

I am actually glad that this myth was broken. When I first saw the image and the title, I was like "Shit! Is that all it takes to do a 51% attack on the network?" But when I read that [its a lie]( I was relieved. In other words, its a good news.

May! Or it may go to 1,000,000 tomorrow. I am not talking about "may", just stating the facts.

Do none of the wallets integrate with Quickbooks? I think Coinbase and Bitpay already do.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:31:50
And how do they receive notification when an item is bought? Email?
@_date: 2015-07-04 12:48:31
Who made this originally? We should request them to update it.
@_date: 2015-07-04 10:27:57
Not true. People who have bought in the last 6 months probably haven't lost anything at all. Bitcoin has been relatively VERY stable for the last 6 months. Some people might have even doubled their money (buying at 160 and selling at 300).

Are you dumb, or are you acting dumb? Do you even know what the "Consensus Reached" header in this table means? It means that majority (75%) of the miners installing Bitcoin-XT. How will that result in Fail for Bitcoin-XT?
If his "assumption" is wrong, then "Consensus Reached" will never happen. So, it will be "OK" in either case whether you have Bitcoin-Core or Bitcoin-XT.

I know its not the answer to your question, but in most cases you won't need to sell bitcoins. These days you can buy almost everything with bitcoins. There is a huge list of businesses that accept bitcoin. But if you really need to sell, then there are exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, or Coinbase and Circle.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:16:53
So basically we will ask the merchant to input item details, price, their Bitcoin (or any altcoin) address and then give them a script to embed on their website?

Good idea. But if Airbnb starts accepting Bitcoin in the near future, this effort will be fruitless. Not trying to discourage, but talking about the potential risk.
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:20:15
I have already thought about ad bidding using Bitcoin.
It would be even more interesting to make the user a party, i.e. pay the user a portion. But then it opens a whole new can of worms of dishonest users (bots).

I'm sure the Greeks thought so, until it just happened! The chances may be slim, but I wouldn't say "never". It can even happen in US or Canada, all the govt. has to do is pass an executive order. I am not saying it will be without consequences, just saying that it is possible. And in the case of Italy/Portugal, highly likely.
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:02:38
If that's the case, then why even bother about 0.7 mb? Why don't they mine empty blocks? 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:44:30
Its actually ONE of the 26 billion addresses on ONE of the grains of sand on ONE of those Earths.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:11:51
Searches in rest of the Europe haven't changed much. Its too late for Greece now. If we wanna save people's money, we have to focus on Spain, Italy and Portugal, which are next in line.
@_date: 2015-07-03 11:40:04
I don't think the increased adoption will be such a burden on the blocks. Most people will just buy and do cold storage. There isn't much you can do with bitcoins in these countries, except for when there are capital controls in place and you cant use cash.
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:36:52
I am sure the creditors have forced Greece to implement severe haircuts. The haircut shock along with relaxed banking restrictions will definitely push more people into Bitcoin.

You mean start regulating the entry points aka exchanges? We shouldn't just give up because of a hypothetical situation. When and if that does happen, we'll figure something out. At least lets start the spark.

Offline, as in without Internet connection?
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:13:23
Yea, then lets increase the limit to 20 mb and let 21 continue mining 0.7 mb blocks. Maybe another pool will start mining bigger blocks and clean up the backlog.
@_date: 2015-07-03 07:28:57
He/She got the math wrong. In the household income analogy, it should be 385 in budget cuts, not 38.5.

Unless you feel intimidated. You saying no, at such a later stage in the transaction could infuriate the "criminal" leading to undesired consequences.

Since coinbase is guilty of "Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.", does that mean will ban Coinbase and discussions of Coinbase from the sub?
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:27:25
Yea, also lets ban Coinbase and discussions of Coinbase from this sub, BitcoinTalk, and all other properties controlled by you.
@_date: 2015-11-13 02:17:57
But I think the show can still go after the Bitcoin seller and try to collect the amount.
@_date: 2015-10-25 19:15:19
Until starts banning these "spam" transactions. Bitcoin is a "settlement" network.

I would stay away from such a site, with no information on who is behind it. Could be a scam. And why can I only buy 0.1 BTC or 2.5 BTC? Why not any other fraction?

This made me pee in the library, thanks.

If you are looking for feedback, you should post this to other uncensored bitcoin subreddits. A lot of intelligent members of the community have been banned from this sub.
