Went up too fast

Ride it out, I’m in the same boat with Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:17:43
If bitcoin ever reaches 1,000,000,000 USD per coin, your 1.50$ will be worth 88,000$ USD.

No, they’d just have to pay their taxes and they’re good.

My calculations say you’re gonna be in deep blue sea until February. HODL strong and believe

Bitcoin doesn’t care if you get your coins stolen or not, it’s a Blockchain.

1000$ is a good start. 10,000 is even better. But for those who don’t have a lot of $.... starting up with 100$ is also good:) just don’t recommend going with Bitcoin... you’ll hardly see gains at this point with 100$.

The only 6 coins I believe in right now (because I haven’t read up on any others lately) are IOTA, Litecoin, OMG, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ark. 
invested in each of em and not gonna budge until I make huge gains. Long term hodler here!

Some people do, most lose $ because it is impossible to time the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:18:51
Of course it does....

With all these crazy bullruns, I wouldn’t be surprised if it hit 100K in a month and a half.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:23:40
It will my friend! Bitcoin is still a baby compared to what it could be valued at in 2 years time!
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:04:57
The answer to your first question is in your second question. 
Maybe, but the name will forever be known among us because of its record breaking gains and all the media outlets only ever cover bitcoin rather than all of the Cryptocurrencies.

Not worth it 
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:26:15
More like 4 or 5 years

I thought selling half of what I have in crypto yesterday was the dumbest mistake I could’ve done. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 15:31:45
So is it like this?... a small country has 10$ altogether, the country owes 11$ but they can’t collectively pay the total. Where is the non-existent 1$ gonna come from? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:50:39
Bitcoin is transparent though. Transparent BUT Decentralized. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:12:00
It’s not a bad thing.

Thanks for buying, your sacrifice is admirable.
