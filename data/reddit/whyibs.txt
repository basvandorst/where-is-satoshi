I reached it the minute I bought into crypto because I assumed this was going to be a rollercoaster from the beggining. I'll check my portfolio once a month and see if I want to withdraw anything in a year. Till then I don't need to see +1000% gains one week and -1000% gains another.

Do we expect anymore dips to 13-14k or was this weekend our only chance to buy low?

Well I don't mind waiting a few days if they do indeed "kill" the link to my bank. I'm just concerned they don't do that and leave the payment info on the account.

How can we stay informed to find the next 'Bitcoin'? Meaning where can we read up on new types of cryptocurrency that are coming out that have actual potential and better technology that could possibly overtake Bitcoin in future?

I'm still not getting the whole mining/block thing. Correct me when I'm wrong. So far my understanding is that miners take a number of transactions and process them together through solving a mathematical problem thus creating a block added to the chain and earning them coins.
How can a mathematical problem create coins? Doesn't this create a priority system that is unbalanced? (IE. If you know miners you get bumped to front of line)

I can't yet. Going through Coinbase process, took 5 days to verify bank now waiting for ID verification.

Dip? I only see it going up around 15-16k+

Outside the space? What does that mean?

I'm trying to, but you have to link a bank account. I'm not giving them my bank login info that's irresponsible so I'm doing the 'manual' link to bank (direct account

I'm sure it keeps being asked because new people jump in all the time. Don't think anyone expects a magic 8 ball just a bit of information from more experienced users. Not asking what the lowest will be, just asking how likely is it based on past behavior to dip.

Thinking of putting in $250 with an extra $200/month across 80% BTC, 10% ETH, 10% Litecoin. Should I be waiting for a dip to go in or now is as good as ever? I don't expect it to drop significantly in days but in 15 days it's almost doubled.

I can understand keeping an account info with who owned it and transaction history. But maintaining an open link to your payment information (bank, CC, etc)? That doesn't seem like it's something they need specially if a customer could return with a new account and need to use same information.

I linked a bank account to coinbase about 3 days ago but still am not seeing any pending trasactions to confirm and have missed two 13K dips I would have entered at. Is this normal? I've never seen pending transactions to take this long.
