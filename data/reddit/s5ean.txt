Coin base is garbage, sorry for your loss OP. How much did you have in your wallet? My account was banned 3 years ago. I've used blockchain wallet but just yesterday I transferred my funds to bread wallet.

I do like the feel and look of blockchain.info wallet but everyone says its not the safest route, Althought i've never had issues, But i did go ahead and transferred them to breadwallet, it did take a few hours to confirm though.
