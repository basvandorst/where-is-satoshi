Looks awesome. Unfortunately android only. 
I use Exodus as Desktop &amp; Ledger as Hardware wallet. Just wanted a nice mobile wallet. 
Just one thing for understanding. Lets say the 
Scenario 1) 0,15 consisted of 10 small transactions
Now When I send it out immediately again i will pay huge amounts, because the file consists of so many small transactions it gets blown up
Scenario 2) 0,15 consists of 10 small transactions
I WAIT 3 days and THEN send it out. Will this make any change because now it got "mined" / build together / whatever?

What you mean with ~ 10 inputs ?

Ahh. Okay now I think I understand the spike. So it's about the size 
It's 1.812 byte. So quite big. What does it depend on why it's big / small? And why is it possible for my ledger to have waayyyyyyyy smaller fees? Does it depend on how many small transactions were put together to create the 0,15 in this case ? And the fees on the ledger aren't so high because I had multiple btcs transferred at once ?(am I even making sense)

Seriously? I know there has been a sick transition since Japan jumped on the train etc. but my ledger also only has 2-3$ fee when I send 1 btc. So it's def the wallet
