I can't believe I just watched a 2 hour youtube video at 3am..
For people looking for a TL;DR of this, THIS video IS a TL;DR of bitcoin. You can't really TL;DR a TL;DR. Watch the whole thing! 
Also props to the Canadian senate. This video was only real good because of the questions they asked. They're exactly the people we need to be asking these questions.

It's nice to see my home country in this subreddit but you're definitely right.
I've seen this issue in other subreddits before.
But yeah it would be foolish to ignore that there are people here working on Circle, or Coinbase, or any other service.

Just found this out today. Thought I'd share. The downside is you get charged a 0.3% transaction fee from google.

As someone who barely knew what Gentoo was before this; this post just made me love linux and the community. Even more reason to learn it now

Lol i was thinking the same thing. I could walk away from the tv during this doc but not the Andreas vid. 
I think it's the pacing. Was expecting a lot of attention when the price of bitcoin was at $1k. That happened in the last 10 mins and there was 0 reaction and footage about it.

Oo if this is true then that's actually the huge no-no.
