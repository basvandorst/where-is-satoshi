Cool demo video. So is that mycelium signing something on the proof of payment qr?
Popo: Proof of payment origin. Pots: Proof of transaction signer.

Lol I asked someone if I could pay them back in bitcoin today then he brought up dogecoin as a joke.. he didn't even understand that dogecoin IS a joke. the only reason he knew about bitcoin was because in one of the google as a person videos, there is a quote "un-buy bitcoin"

Woot woot!! Thanks. Its a cool concept, keep up the good work.

The buyer probably gets to know the sellers real name on the bank account they are depositing into

Restarting after that long doesn't sound too bad. Could be a check against most of the money ending up in few hands. Although I guess if people were tired of bitcoins concentration they could just start using a different shitcoin
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:49:29
Here is my basic understanding: Its like localbitcoins where you need to make a deposit into someone's bank account. but there is a person on BitQuick side that manages the communication between buyer and seller. 
Note: I haven't used it for 1+ years but this is what I recall
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:16:49
So like bitreserve?

 is a fairy bare bones UI that might work with you old android browser. I am not currently aware of any blockchain explorer apps tho sorry.
Edit: well that's unfortunate its not maintained

As far as I can tell, it only connects to your coinbase BTC account. if I could connect this to my coinbase USD account I would feel more comfortable using it as I would not need to worry about the coinbase fee variable.

I found these php scripts that might work:
I have not tried this one but looks old (maybe too old?) but may be what I am looking for.
Looks like a PHP &lt;-&gt; RPC script that I could write a custom wallet for

This is what everyone gets for not diversifying the mining hardware. Tough shit if you purchase hardware from a company that is not open about the software used.

I just tried for the 2nd time and it seems like a nice project

just to add, I've been using sfox.com for values under $500 via ACH. works well, I like that I can set the price and wait for orders to trigger.
edit: they do have rules where you cannot withdraw bitcoin purchased with USD that was deposited within the last week or so, so not as instant as circle or coinbase can be

I just set up a pi2 last week, took a week to download the whole chain from the network
(pic from today slightly after it caught up)
before it caught up it was running all 4 cores at max.

I have a Jalapeno, batch ~2700 (July 2012 preorder), got my ROI, but still waiting for my other Jalapeno (December 2012 preorder)
Glad I didn't leap for better hardware at the time of initial purchases.
