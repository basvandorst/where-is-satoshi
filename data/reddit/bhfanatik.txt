what does it mean for Bitfinex? Should we get our coins off of the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:49:48
why the 23rd
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:13:27
You're doing the Lord's work
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:14:41
when do you think the next dip will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:52:22
Same :-(

NEVER tell her. She will feel entitled to your money. All women are like that.

Nobody knows for sure, but according to traders, what goes up that fast must go down.

5K, I want to believe
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:35:16
It'll dip again. Let's all make it happen with the power of our minds. Law of attraction :D
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:41:50
good job guys, keep doing it. We want it to drop to 5K
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:35:40
Electrum 3.0.2
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:39:26
waiting to see if it'll go down to 5k :-(

some s2x supporter shamelessly say they want to destroy "core", so yes it's an attack on bitcoin.

dip in 'gina
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:11:15
man, I hope it will dip soon.. missed the previous one. I sold my BTC at 7100. It has to go lower if I want to get back in. :D
@_date: 2017-10-22 02:41:01
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:15:30
I hope so! Spending a 1000$ and only getting like 0.15 BTC feels shitty
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:50:29
You're a fool bro. Hodl and never get married. All women are hypergamous.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:50:36
Just crash already! I want to buy at $4000 :D
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:00:08
Yes! I want to have a full bitcoin before it goes to the moon
