I am able to think deeper and realize that Craig wanted some mystery around it and preferred idiots like you think and call him a scam, rather than be known as Satoshi.

Yes because JP Morgan and others had already filed patents.  Craig Wright's story is certainly pretty wild but he has not been proven to be a liar as far as claiming to be Satoshi.  There is still a good chance he is Satoshi and just wanted to act weird and throw people off his trail.

Interesting nullc, why does this completely contradict your [earlier comments on Craig Wright's patents](

Inflation and deflation are confusing terms for a lot of people and people have twisted their meaning.  Inflation is supposed to mean increasing the money supply and deflation would be a decrease in money supply.  But instead people are calling Bitcoin deflationary, even though Bitcoin is actually inflationary, with a 21 million cap that will never be reached, but the quantity of Bitcoin is always increasing.  At some point it is possible it could be deflationary only because of lost coins becoming greater than the block reward.  But this would barely be deflationary and would be more close to a constant supply.  Also instead, people say its deflation when prices go down, and inflation when prices go up, which is really wrong and misunderstanding by those who believe and repeat this.
Also Milton Friedman has been critical of inflation, and money printing, and I would consider him pretty mainstream as one of the most popular econiomists on history.
[Here]( and [here]( are two great interviews with Friedman from the 1970s which are very entertaining and at some point he also goes over his opinion of the Fed and inflation.  He said that the Fed should not exist, but if it had to exist the only reasonable thing it could do is have a small constant rate of inflation.  I don't see this quote as conclusive evidence that he prefers an inflationary currency, but just that if the Fed exists that would be the only reasonable thing to do.

Maybe he doesn't give a shit what morons like you think.  He already proved it to Gavin and others, he doesn't need worthless people like you to believe in him. You would just spit on his invention anyways.

But [JP morgan](  also filed patents and posters on that thread were arguing about how Craig's patents were defensive.
