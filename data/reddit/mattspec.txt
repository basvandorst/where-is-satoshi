there are very very few  banks which offer 0 fees, only pc financial does it in canada, ive used it and have to say its a VERY watered down version of banking.

I saw the one in Ottawa while in development. It's 100% legit, ran transactions through right in front of me.

this statement is true, also if youve paid off your balance inside 30 days you owe 0% interest. its a possible scenario but an unlikely one. start moving meaningful amounts of cash around, thats when you see the banks bite back though. "derp, where our fees derp"

The sad part is that in either case (be it a bank or paypal) your message will be sent to an entry lvl clerk who will be unemployed by year's end who is just as or more broke than you probably are. Were creating jobs people!

This is a two birds with one stone argument. This would further marginalize Gold vs USD and Bitcoin our new awesome flashy new tech would inherit all of the problems that gold has had to endure since god knows when. BAD IDEA.

Sure they could make a coin, but MasterCard doesn't do that business. It's in the business of generating fees. If theyre able to innovate right now it's in their best interest. They've only had to compete against USD cards. China and Russia are readying national payment systems and who knows how long it takes till theyre global? Square is making it easier every day.
If MasterCard were to launch a coin they would certainly do it under a different name under a different company and throw their marketing and development resources at it.
I think the thing which has 0% chance, is MasterCard releasing a coin. 
Thats my 2 satoshis.

mastercard has been at the front of payment tech lately though, they were the first to offer no sign under $xxx also they were the first to use RFID "tap payment" and now visa has really got a monopoly merging with banks a la Visa Debit card. Mastercard has plenty to gain through working with crypto
(all my information is as ive personally experienced in canada)

Joe Rogan is not interested in BitCoin yet imo. I've been watching the show for years now. I'm sure he would totally be into it. But i think that the best way to show him is by getting onnnit to accept it first.
