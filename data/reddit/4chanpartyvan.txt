High is a relative term.
It started 2013 at single digits and ran to 266 bucks in the span of a few months. This rally doesn't have shit on that. Call me when we get  a single candle like the one that took us from 266 to ~50 in April 2013

That was never the argument. They're big fish in the only pond that we give a shit about, this one. And the "whales" of wall street want into THIS pond. But the big boys won't let them

I can, I just can't understand how to be such a poor adult that a couple thousand bucks is something you need to clear with the wife. Sorry if your circumstances are different.

This isnt anything close to a bear run. It's a relatively healthy (and obvious) correction after how extended we got. Check the RSI and see how weak those last few drives up were. This was bound to happen. Buy the 10-11k bottom and just hold.

Are you really this autistic about BCH?

If I ever had to resort to getting my wife's "permission" to speculate with a couple grand I'd probably fucking kill myself tbh.

That's pretty fucking sad if true. I hope your wife keeps the keys to your chastity cage somewhere safe!

Not threatened at all, just calling a spade a spade
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:52:43
Pretty much. And if it is, why the fuck are you throwing it into something as speculative as bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:22:31


christ, we really are corecucks aren't we.

Although in theory there are people out there with bigger bankrolls in fiat terms, i doubt there are many that would be willing to put that much capital on bitcoin vs the whales that exist with 10000+ coins
the BTC big boys are the whales, not wall street

Just understand we're likely revisiting 10-11k so if you can't stomach that then just get out now. Although if you can't stomach that then you picked the wrong market to speculate in lmao

Says the abject fucking loser who got dumped on and now wants everyone to be as miserable as him. Sorry for your loss :)

if a 4 figure investment is a "large money decision" then you're the 12 year old.

lmao the day some shitcoin like BCH or IOTA flips crypto is the day hell freezes over
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:46


Either hold and double down at 10-11k (hey look at that, it seems to have been the bottom! like I said!) or be a bitch and sell at a loss and learn that this market isn't for you.

1) liquidation entails the exchange buying back his shorted contracts at market prices, generally spiking the prices up as a net benefit to all those who are long
2) traders are a sadistic bunch that get a certain kick out of seeing others get wiped out
3) the general bitcoin public is bullish on their pet project and don't like to see people take short positions against it, even if at times shorting is a logical choice for an overbought market.
