you don't tell these sorts of people about bitcoin, all they will do is tax it, or buy it all up and monopolize it. Very dangerous

Yes all is good now :D Finally getting the hang of it now.

hahahaha thanks for that

So it will eventually confirm, thank you. I didn't realise that there was a stress test.
If I'm honest I'm kind of new to the DIY core wallet, I'm quite happy to pay fees in order to ensure transactions go through, I really don't want to be waiting a long time for transactions because I intend to be transferring quite big amounts. 
I'm guessing that coinbase was having me pay larger fees, I will work on getting an adequate default transaction fee.

Put simply, bitcoin is not a dollar, bitcoin is like the equivalent of a billion dollars. If bitcoin replaced fiat, 1 satoshi would be a cent, and 100 satoshis would end up being a dollar. 
It is quite possible that the pioneers with just one btc right now could end up being filthy rich in the future.

Ladies and gentlemen this is not a discussion about HYIPs, I am well aware of the risks involved with investing in such schemes, and have dealt with gains and losses already. I am quite a risk-taker.
What I was not prepared for however was the sight of my transaction being unconfirmed, now with the knowledge that my fees were too low, and that it will eventually be confirmed, I am a happy camper. Thanks for your help everyone.

yet all those business and land etc are calculated in a value of dollars. They may not have dollars in the bank (which some have trillions of..Rothschilds for instance) but it always comes down to green.

"All the f***ing money on earth" would be worthless if the economy collapsed. I'm not talking about direct replacement, I'm simply talking about allowing bitcoin to be a global currency.

Okay its been almost 24 hours now. I'm a little concerned, will I end up losing my money? Will it ever send?
@_date: 2015-07-15 23:13:59
Thanks yes, I saw it earlier it's been sent to my HYIP. Very happy. I'll make sure to include a .00025 fee on all transactions now (which are usually big amounts anyway). Thanks man.

Think about it, I'm not saying this is certainty, but theoretically 21 million bitcoins simply cannot suffice as a form of currency for a global market. However distribute wealth in the form of micro-bitcoin or satoshis and then its a tenable form of economy.
Thus those who hold bitcoins will be the wealthy elites of this new society..although I have to question whether bitcoin would be the new form of wealth if the dollar/euro were to collapse.

Yes, very true!
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:04:13
Thanks guys, I may invest in an asic instead then

what we need is a decent system of converting coin BACK to fiat quickly and easily.

Hopefully because we poor folks simply cannot afford the current prices. So people stopped paying over a hundred pounds for bitcoins, and the market crashed.
