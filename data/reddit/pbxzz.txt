solved too, for me

seems all deposits are affected, have a Dash &amp; BCH transaction stuck
someone knows if this problem resolves itself or only with ticket?

With a blocksize of 1MB which is not sufficent for the actual amount of transactions he wants to reduce it. This proposal was only a provocation for the big blockers not more not less.

    If the proposal gets 95% mining power, the risk related to HF would be negligible.


Can you go more into detail as everyone is talking about the HF &amp; splitting blockchain risk. What are the other risks ?
@_date: 2017-03-13 06:17:45
Probably the *pre mining* of ~ 1,9m coins in the fist 48h of dash mining
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:11:35
 &gt; well I'm also saying no to a 2MB hard fork now :)
The only reason to do this have to be technical ones and these have to balance against the situation which will be created if you do so.

Paying goods online/offline; remittance of smaller amounts
Why we have 8 fractional digits when we can use only 2 to 3?
@_date: 2017-03-04 02:51:06


Deploy it :)  and is it really usable for irregular remittance payments?
To 1: if, ... but today we are not there and to get there its better to address the problem we have today 
To 2: 0.0000001 is not 0.001
@_date: 2017-03-06 14:03:23


But this will not help irregular remittance payments because once the LN channel have to be closed

If we remove all transactions with &lt; 60 satoshi per byte their would still be a backlog, so whats your definition for spam?
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:48:21
It is clearly more than one miner and one buisiness, but thats not the point. It is more and more a political conflict and not a technical one, which it should be!

To be honest, Core &amp; BU supporter have their arguments.
But the time he came out with his proposal is a bit late to consider it not a provocation. 
There was a huge backlog in january before this proposal and the lightning network is only in teststage today.

I can follow your decision, but raising the fees to that level in the actual situation will prevent many use cases for btc I thought it is for, even with segwit this problem will likely not be solved. 
In my view it is a balancing act between capability of the network in relation to cost, where is the advantage of keeping the cost small for a node when I can by one for the transaction fees.

We talking about bitcoin and bitcoin scaling here not about altcoins.

Without a proper gui integration in the wallet software, you can't blame the people for not using it.

As for verifying blocks only, you need to do one block every approx. 10min, with the problem to catch up if your node doesn't run 24/7, I think its possible to do 2MB Blocks with segwit ontop. 
For future a auto scaling solution as Luke.jr proposed (not with the same numbers :) or based on the free space of the blocks would be desirable if we look at the present scaling debacle.
