here's 3 bits of advice i have for you OP
1) Congrats, you lucky bastard. i wish i had that kind of coin.
2) Read the primer by the other guy on about tax liability issues
3) For the love of all that is holy, talk to your loved ones [just parents] and get a decent tax accountant.
i am happy for you man, and wish you the very best of luck but pretty much everyone you meet outside those you trust [and perhaps even some of those you think you trust] will want to wrestle some of that money away from you.
get a decent accountant, tell your parents, thats it. dont brag about money, in fact i'd recommend reading this article too:  [the guy manages a hedge fund]
its tempting to tell everyone, dont do it!
and keep a few coins, and a little bit to reinvest if the price falls again if you want to make more, but i think take the majority out [80% out 20% in].
hope this helps, and nice one!

Faith. the last act of a desperate man.
kidding aside, i too think it would be pretty cool if bitcoin became here to stay

honest, can i ask you a question? how come reddit havent just brought you onboard to the main team? considering how helpful RES has been to the vast majority of redditors i thought they'd put you as a department head or something

the market is /s
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:41:11
but is it worth buying such a low fraction right now? i thought the main winners were early adopters who bought bitcoins when they were cheap

i'm going to upvote you because i kind of understand what you're saying but i would like someone to parse/translate this

okay so ive got a wallet, how do i send something from the address i was given by bitcointip, to my wallet?
and is address, the public key, and hash something the private key?
@_date: 2013-05-02 06:30:36

as long as its quoted and not stolen, i think that should be fine

i've been lurking in for a few days now and i'm still a bit confused. even looking at the imgur cheatsheet i still dont get how bitcointip and bitcoin accounts work.
do i have to registering my bank details with reddit or something?
how does a hash number, act as a wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:11:20
this was a pretty depressing read. essentially the numerical value of the bitcoins in fiat quoted by the exchanges doesnt relate at all to how much you can cash out for. and people desperate to cash out have been trying for lower than market rates, and still finding it hard to find reliable 'cash upfront' buyers. 
so basically its paper certificates.
i'd really wish there was a clearer reliability for the exchanges used
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:32:00
i'm a little embarassed to ask but by creating an account/wallet on blockchain, is that the same as an address (the one bitcointip bot creates)?
and do you mean create a new wallet and transfer stuff between the two?

obligatory comment about fear/skepticism/concern that this is somehow a scam
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:57:14
