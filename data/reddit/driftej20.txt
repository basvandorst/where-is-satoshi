Those are gorgeous! I don't really have interest in real rifles, but I can appreciate the craftsmanship, and I've never seen finishes that unique on, erm, receivers? Outside of Call of Duty or some specialty airsoft gun manufacturers. Cryptocurrency seems like a good fit for this.

While I'm inclined to agree, I'm gonna guess it's one of those websites that always has sarcastic headlines. It could be satirizing the fact that for a while, a good majority of people did assume that bitcoin was created for nothing other than to buy drugs online, since, that being one of the more elicit and controversial ways it could be used, was probably the most publicized facets of the bitcoin market by the media in general for a while.

You're not mirin the melty cheese theme? Seems like a perfect fit for real estate, for bitcoin.

No idea, was just a guess. I literally only use twitter to ask game developers questions, like whether the servers are down for everyone or it's on my end, and I followed some cryptocurrency related people and accounts for news and various stuff. Don't think I've ever actually tweeted without a specific purpose. But yeah, probably a forum or website.

Cool, thanks. Yeah, I didn't run the exe because it was not the same size as the one on Elerium's website. Out of curiosity, what is that stuff in the javascript

There's a post above that explains why I thought I may have gotten lucky, at the expense of someone that tried to gain access to my bitcoin accounts a few years ago. I didn't touch the files, just read the Javascript inside of Dropbox.

Mine said "Send 1 btc to Alan and leave the other 2.7 btc in the wallet"

Interestingly, I haven't been active in the cryptocurrency scene for years, not since a couple months after BTC topped out at $1100 or so. I still have accounts at BTC-E, Cryptsy etc. but my coins are all in cold storage anyways. Someone got into my email and attempted to use it to access my accounts, but couldn't because of 2FA etc...
I thought that maybe they had managed to do something while logged in to my email, and someone they were in contact with from my email might have fucked up and sent me something attempting to send coins to whoever got into my email some 2 years ago, but looks like the more likely answer is they just found my email at some cryptocurrency website or based on who I follow on twitter and I got put on a list with other people likely to have a wallet on their PC.

That wasn't the only reason I didn't run it, I'm just saying they didn't try very hard to make it look legit.
