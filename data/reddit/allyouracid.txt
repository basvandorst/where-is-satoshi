"I had my phone stolen on the 4th, 9th, 10th, twice on the 15th, 17th, 20th of last month and the 2nd of this month, 4th, three times on the 5th, three times just yesterday, and very likely again today."
Thanks man. I'm literally dying. I have tears in my eyes!

I'll tell you what will happen: we will get a nice opportunity to buy cheap Bitcoin, and once Ver's stash is depleted and he's left with a bunch of (then) worthless shitcoins, he will realize that there's noone to dump on and that the only thing he managed to do is reduce the net worth of his account down to a fraction.
Maybe, just maybe, he will leave crypto for good and come back in disguise, as a troll who blames the bad world for the loss of his fortune.
I'm sick of all this bullshit. Just increase that stupid block size to 2 and we're good for a while. It's really not that hard.
Are there only clowns around in this industry?

That's not what it is about. This is about a marketplace not siding with its users, not about being retarded.
Retardedness punishes itself more than enough, no need for a platform to backstab you without any regrets.

I get your point, and for sure it's best to always assume your data is not safe. Still, there are platforms which stand up for their users, instead of burying their heads in the asses of law enforcement.
There's no need to make it easier for them than it already is.

I just had to upvote this.

This has nothing to do with being naive. It would be worse to just give up because "I cannot change it anyway". People should make some noise when they're not being treated appropriately, and the fact that it's normal to not be treated appropriately doesn't change that. Period.
I don't know where you're coming from, but there actually are countries where privacy and data protection mean something, and where people do stand up for that when shit like this comes to light. This is a good thing. Resigning is not.

I feel bad for his mom. It's probably already breaking her heart that she did this to her son (I have no idea how I'd handle this situation, burning a fortune of my kids, impacting their lives like OP describes), and he treated her badly.
OP, give her a hug. Then go buy Bitcoin again once the market got boring and price is flat, wait another few years and enjoy the gains. :)

I will soon write a support ticket to Kraken, asking how they treat privacy / the data of their users. If I like the answer, I'll move over to them, as they also seem to have a pretty fast connection to the Fidor bank, allowing to get money in and out pretty fast.
Other than that, yea, as that other guy said. Bitstamp is also a good platform to buy / sell BTC.

This is just plain awful. I'm with them since I bought my first Bitcoin in 2012, and everything was always fine. I never thought they'd shit on their users in such a heavy way. It's a punch right in the face.
I'm a bit sad this happened, but under no circumstances can I arrange it with my conscience to support such behavior by buying any more BTC there. 
While of course it's their decision whether they cooperate with the police or side with their users, I would have expected that they protect their users and only hand out data when absolutely necessary. Instead they ran their "own investigations" and delivered way more than they were asked to.
Bitcoin.de, you should be seriously ashamed. What are you, the fucking Bitcoin police??
Can any Hanswurst now come ask for data from users on your platform?
Hell, I cannot even describe how much this upsets me.
They ulltimately lost my trust, and I doubt it's regainable in any way.
My recommendation: don't use bitcoin.de, they cannot be trusted. At all.
*Disclaimer: I never used any Dark Net Market or other websites drugs can be bought on. But protecting users' rights is a topic which I consider highly important. I just care. Fuck that's why I'm in the realms of crypto in the first place!*

Lost what. I'd say you're at a huge premium. If you weren't dumb enough to sell at a loss.
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:06:16
That's not what it's about. It's about that it's weird that a non-guessable password was somehow obtained to log in to an account.
@_date: 2016-09-26 06:30:54
Some people have weird ideas on how support should work. While it would of course be nice to always get an answer immediately, even support guys do have weekends.
I have opened a ticket on  on Saturday and haven't received an answer yet. Guess why – it's weekend. 
Now stand in the corner and be ashamed of yourself, because you made all those accusations while your order is already being sent.

I did the same, and it took like 10 hours, on three transactions:
I found all this very annoying. One individual (or a group of individuals) wants some sort of information and relentlessly lets a huge part of the network suffer for their minor needs. Coming then, complaining about some sort of ongoing censorship when their selfish spam transactions are rejected is just ridiculous.
CoinWallets, please stop that mean behavior. Use the fuckin testnet, that's what it's there for.

Hey guys,
does anyone know where the ticker went? Any news? Did something not work out?
The ticker was supposed to be here: 
But it cannot be found anymore.
The only thing I can find is this: 
Did they rename it?
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:33:28
Sounds legit.

Why would anyone spend his precious Bitcoins on... things?
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:03:50
Hey Andreas,
"I'm sure many people will think I was wrong to decline the "opportunity" to verify SN's identity."
I absolutely don't think so. If it's his/their desire to remain anonymous, there should be no third party violating this desire (no matter if it'd be possible to do so or not).
Kudos for your decision; no need to explain yourself whatsoever.

This whole story was a total mess. It's not a hack, but exchanges should not be directly involved in scams. 
This is just one recent example of what makes me refuse to use this exchange. A search on BCT returns a lot of shady stuff.
@_date: 2015-02-17 10:21:50
If it's true or not, Bter.com is and has always been one of the most shady exchanges in existence.
Every now and then, something bad happens and users are left alone. I mean seriously, how many times did they get hacked, already? Cannot even count it, anymore.
Either they are total morons in terms of server security and cryptocurrencies as a whole, or they are a sophisticated bunch of scammers.
I really feel sorry for the users. I don't know if it's because of the high pace crypto advances at, but for some reason, users tend to forget such things way too quickly.
They get hacked, the mob gets upset and a month later, people use this crappy exchange like nothing had happened. This is really sad.
