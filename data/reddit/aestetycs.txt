Sorry for my bad english .. once again I'm not a native speaker. A friend of mine had the same  problem .. he transfered 20K and the money apperared in the acoount 1 month later after many calls, mails, bug tickets and of course he told them he will take leagal actions. The problem was solved in a month period .. where btc price excalalted (Bad Luck Brian I suppose)
Those things never hapend to me. I have the best experience with Cex .. the only thing that bothered me was temporarly locking the exchange when the volume was too big. But things are still better than other exchanges with very big scalability issues.

it's cheaper and faster than the current standard "situation" =&gt;&gt; banks ... not charging you for "managing your zero dollars account", open 7/24 (no lazy Sundays)  .. and don't get me started on the interest .. BTC will improve (LN) ... the volatility will calm with Futures (by by pumpy dumpy) ... it doesn't have to be perfect or the best crypt right now .. just better than what we already use. And stop looking at it like a currency anyway ... see it more like a commodity (moons diamonds - not gold)

Better make bitcoin illegal fast ... cause the more the adoption = the more people involving ... the harder will be to stop bitcoin .. but in reality this is only a spook ... the government will never close something  ... if they can profit. Plus I don't understand the stigma with bitcoins and governments this days .. too much drama! Till that day ... enjoy the moon!
