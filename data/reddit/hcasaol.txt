Someone said that it has something to do with the winter Olympics in Sochi.   
I got a couple payments like this.  One from a different address as well.

From their website:
"Vasalgel, a multi-year contraceptive
VasalgelTM is a long-acting, nonhormonal contraceptive similar to vasectomy but with one significant advantage: it is likely to be more reversible. The procedure is similar to a no-scalpel vasectomy, except a gel is injected into the vas deferens (the tube the sperm swim through), rather than cutting the vas (as is done in vasectomy). If a man wishes to restore flow of sperm, whether after months or years, the polymer is flushed out of the vas with another injection."

vz88fjj, you must be incredibly happy right now.  I think we all hope that the current trend continues.

Bought a PS4 with a Gyft card that I bought with bitcoin.  Can't wait for the announcements.

I only started looking into bitcoin in May and only really started watching the price charts once I got my got my first bitcoins recently.  This bitcoin paranoid app on my phone doesn't help with all of this.

I am a current customer and I can see the hardware on their webpage, it's actually going to be 3TH, but they say it can increase.  I think it will actually be more like 3.5TH once it's out.  Under promise and over deliver like they did with their 28 nm chips.

It's an Android app.  It sounds like you're on an iPhone?
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:31:17
Incredible idea.  I'd use it all the time.

I wouldn't mind if it went back down to to around $260.  I spent my first bitcoin paying for my PS4 pre-order from Amazon with a Gyft card earlier this week.  Even though it was cool to buy a PS4 with bitcoin, it wasn't cool that by the end of the week bitcoin was at around $360.
@_date: 2013-11-04 15:18:30
Sounds like you guys are doing great things.  I'm interested in an invite.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:00
Ok, coming back up already.  I need to stop watching bitcoinity.

Wow, nice site.  I like the way you can flip it to bitcoin for payment.
