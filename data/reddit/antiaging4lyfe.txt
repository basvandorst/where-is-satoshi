Nsa has back door into apple products, maybe Nsa is on a coin run.

I hope Bitcoin unseats Paypal.  If my online biz could use Bitcoin instead of Paypal I would save around $700 a month.

Apple should be scared of the $55 new unlocked Android smart phone I just bought.

Yet another "pundit" bashing Bitcoin because they see their careers about to go down the toilet.  Don't expect Taxi drivers to talk good about self driving cars either.

I don't have oodles of coins but i just did an offline laptop, ubuntu live cd, bitaddress.org downloaded from the source and bip0038.  Trust bitaddress.org code?  Well it's used by a shit ton of people and open source.  I would like to think someone would have deemed it unsecure by now.  The bottom line is if you can't trust bitaddress what makes the code in Armory or Electrum any more trustworthy?

As long as there are trolls flaming bitcoin and frothing at the mouth we'll hit 10k.  It seems the more these assholes throw tantrums the better BTC performs.

I think this will be illegal. That dollar vigilante dude tried to do it, but had to appease 6 government agencies and secure a 25million security bond or something, so him and his lawyers gave up.

PayPal = horse drawn buggy  
Bitcoin = the automobile   
Bye bye PayPal, your days are numbered. Good riddance.

Lmao, this guy is clueless.  His anti Bitcoin stance is because his career is over if it succeeds.   We'll no longer need his ilk. He also has no concept of technology and exponential growth.

MSM tries to force Bitcoin out and label it as a joke destined for failure.  It will only make victory that much sweeter :)

I could see the large VC funded companies (coinbase, etc) using their datacenters to help keep things healthy (would be in their best interest).

This is good news imo because, the entire financial system is based on corruption.  If you bring those corrupt forces into Bitcoin and give them a stake in Bitcoin, then we might be less likely to see the other corrupt forces attempting to crush Bitcoin.  Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Wall street getting onboard kind of makes Bitcoin harder to kill.

Mine are paper and bip38. I practiced and got comfortable with it.   Also you can monitor your offline coins at block chain. Info with a "watch only"  account. Makes me feel safer being able to watch them.

Well Schiff seems to think the US has all this gold.  The US dollar is only 17% backed by gold at this point.  As for Ft. Knox?  Don't make me laugh, it is widely known there is no gold there.  No one is allowed in and the last audit was in the early 60's.  That gold is gone, but they are damn good at keeping up appearances.  Ron Paul asked for some simple proof the gold is still there and was denied.

Haters blow my mind.. "ha ha die Bitcoin! Then I can continue getting raped by central banking and the power elite! I'm so smart!".  
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:28:45
Two reasons 1) Bitcoin is getting some crazy VC funding now 2) Wallstreet wants in on it.  
  
I think bitcoin has cornered the market in digital currency in a similar way that facebook has cornered the market in social networking.  Sure there are shit tons of facebook clones but in comparison they are somewhat irrelevant in comparison.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:56:21
I look at it this way.. I missed out on google, apple etc.  I imagine at that time those companies could have been had for next to nothing the same could be said.  
  


  
Yes, it's a big gamble.  Personally I've put 4k into it.  It would be painful to lose that 4k but if I do I'm ok with that.  I would rather have a shot and being an early adopter of something with such huge potential -and lose, than to sit by and have big regrets 15yrs from now (Oh God, why didn't I just buy 1 coin back in 2013!?? FML!!).

The future of the internet is somewhat grim.  These disruptive technologies like Bitcoin can't be stopped unless the internet is put under extreme control.  They'll have no choice to do this.  Maybe stage another 9-11 and claim 'teh interwebs funded the turrurist baby killers, everybody now needs internet ID for teh accesses".  So there you go, you 'can' access the internet but only as yourself and will be tracked 100%.  Some may say then we'll just create a "meshnet" and bypass them.  Good luck with that because wifi signals can be triangulated, you're going to run a meshnet node at your home?  What will you do with the black SUVs pull up in your driveway?

That's not what I mean.  I mean running something on the vps that helps the Bitcoin infrastructure, not buying a vps with bitcoin.

It seems bizarre to me, in that if I have a server farm and rent that processing out to mine for x dollars, and the miners produce more than x dollars why not just use the farm for myself and mine with it?

Reminds me of the dozens of startups claiming to be the next google.  Bitcoin is a google of currency so good luck to competitors they're gonna need it.

What the hell is Apple's problem?  I love my macbook air because it serves it's purpose well, but I can't bring myself to consider the gestapo style ecosystem of an iPhone.  Not to mention some pretty snazzy unlocked Android phones on the market for like $100.

BitPay = Netflix
bye bye Paypal, couldn't happen to a nicer bunch of thugs.

What amazes me beyond belief is how this guy lost 33M in bitcoin to the FEDs, was he high on crack or something?  It did not occur to him to maybe put 20-30 million in cold storage and bury it somewhere?  What did he just have 33 million sitting in a hot wallet or 33 million in paper coins sitting on his desk?  Every million I would have it in cold storage and dispersed in safety deposit boxes around the world lol.  wtf?
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:38:09
I'm still new at this so not 100% sure.  You just want to be able to check it without using your private keys.  I found a watch only setup easiest to use to keep an eye on it and ensure no one can use it, even if my account were hacked.

Bip38 encrypt your paper wallet too :-)
