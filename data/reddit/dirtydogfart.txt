All this price talk lol bunch of amateurs.
It's not a Bart, it's a homer, with sign's of a upcoming Lisa, speculation over Russia may cause upward pressure in a typical Apu pattern but watch out for brief wiggums that may destabilise a overall marge run. In Q2 we can expect repeated Moe's.

This sounds legit.

Ok, send me 0.001 BTC (nothing if you have 1000+ like you say) from any address that has over 50btc ( I'm assuming you have the 1000+ split between addresses but I'm sure with 1000+ those addresses must contain at least 50 each) you can then post here the transaction and I will confirm I received it proving you have at least 50 of the 1000+ you claim to have.
What you say ? Proof or stfu

Anyone want to donate $10 so I can see how much I will have in a year's time ?

Hi Molly, 
My thinking is I don't have to give away personal information along with my banking details.(not that I plan to do anything dodgy with it or have anything to hide).
Saying that, I've looked at the map recommended in other comments and the nearest active one is some distance and I'm not sure I want to waste the best part of a day driving there to get a little bitcoin lol!. There is one near relitives I  plan to visit in late Feb so that's a option.

Oh shit, thanks for the heads up. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 15:18:27
I'm not in it at all.

Trying to acquire bitcoin much harder than giving up the smokes.
Anyone got a spare $10 worth they can spare to help me get started ?

Banks not going to worry about it, when the protester's wear suits and drive new cars then that's when they got a problem. Unemployed bus taking protester's got fuck all to withdraw.

Not much of a money man Carlos if you can't even spare $10. Maybe change your name to NoMoneyManCarlos.

I wear a yellow vest all day long (although we just call them high Viz)
Thank you for the welcome, can I have some bitcoin ?

Actually found out about it years ago when a friend set up a wallet on my phone and sent me £5 on a night out. Totally forgot about it, don't think I ever opened the wallet after that night.. then around mid 2017 the same guy who gave me the £5 bought a new car and we got talking about it and it turned out he had cashed in some bitcoin to buy it. I remembered the £5 he had given me but by then had a different phone and sold the old one. He said the £5 would have been worth about £200, asked how I could get it back and thought how fucking stupid that I couldn't get it back. So not the best introduction to bitcoin, and then of course the price crashed lol!
Started to take a interest only quite recently, the price being relatively stable compared to how it has been and the fact that it still here after the price tanked so hard makes me think now is a good time maybe to get in.

Is there a list of locations ? I'm in the UK and it seems like the easiest way to get hold of a little bitcoin.

I run a shelter for retired drug sniffer dogs. The dogs have spent their entire life's looking for drugs and we find that unless we keep them stimulated they get very depressed. Unfortunately we are low on funds and need to restock our cocaine and marijuana supplies to keep the dogs busy and content. Of course good coke and weed not cheap.
If you have any spare funds, please consider the dogs happiness. Thank you.
