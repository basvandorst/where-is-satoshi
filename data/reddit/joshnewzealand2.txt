Lesson came to late for me. Lost millions to Gox.

yes, my story is almost an exact duplicate of yours (except I lost 235). I think my folly was that I was accustomed to trusting 3rd parties (online banking, ebay and the like). It didn't occur to me the the worlds largest exchange was being run by a bad actor, my natural trust in people is a blessing, but in this case it was a curse.

gold doesn't have practical purpose either except for electrical contacts

you may be surprised how long people hang onto assets, if you own shares or have a retirement/managed funds you often just forget you have it years at a time - and it is supposed to grow faster than inflation.

Price swings make me nervous, i don't really like volatility and insecurity. I thought maybe i should take up a hobby like a vegetable patch ... but my doctor said screw that and trade bitcoins.

One quarter of the Mt Gox coins still exist, and it rightfully belongs to creditors, i'm want to believe we live in the world where these will be returned to us.

I have over 200 bitcoins showing on my balance at Mt Gox. Tried to withdraw one (like as a test) to a wallet and it disappeared, failed transaction and no support response.  Could try and withdraw the rest but they will disappear as well.
I don't know how I am going to explain this to my family. Am I really stupid, man Mt Gox look real and I never entertained the thought of a fiat withdrawal. And it still looks real. Duped I guess.

235 coins. Almost the same as me.  My plans for the future, all gone. To think last year I was running around the park feeling financially secure. What a fool to believe.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:39:41
It is the hope part that gets me to. I lost 235 BTC and 'hope' to get them back. What else have I got to hope for it was my future.

hindsight is always 20/20, they are still making big dollars in fees, at least $50k every day. They can't be insolvent.

wtfisbitcoin the wisdom behind sticking with Mt Gox was not move funds around so much as to lose track of them. It was nice to have the BTC in one place accessible with one password (if it ain't broke don't fix it). But of course now it is broke.
Also the tendency is to trust first.

the real world sucks, companies fail even with excellent timing and positioning, Mt Gox is a little like a rich mans son who fails despite been given every opportunity to succeed.
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:22:55
and right now he is frantically trying to find someone to sort this mess out. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:25:01
just incompetent (lol 'just')
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:08:43
Everything you just said is 100% logical. Gox is not that. Gox is like a son of a wealthy business man who was sent to ivory league schools and introduced to all the important people. but still became a failure. Failed despite every opportunity to succeed. It is difficult to understand palish, its caused me massive personal loss. Sharing it on reddit has helped. Thx everyone.

I'll throw my theory into the mix. I think a senior engineer left Mt Gox over the Christmas break and took a few key personnel with him/her to start an exchange elsewhere. The only people who are left don't really know how the system works. And the CEO is not of the technical type more of an 'ideas' man. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:06:47
i am with you, i honestly never thought they would be keep people's bitcoins either. I knew about the fiat issues but always thought the bitcoins were sacrosanct. Was using Mt gox as a wallet. Didn't see it coming.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:36:07
ten, it will take me that long to laugh this out

Well done man, did you use javascipt?

It is secure - 'https' &lt;-- the s means it is secure.

bittabet in 27 words you just described exactly what should happen: but common sense and simple solutions don't enrich lawyers.
