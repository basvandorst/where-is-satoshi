@_date: 2018-01-30 17:20:05
i think it's important that when people discover this kind of thing that we let our money do the talking and drop this exchange like the hot pile of shit it is
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:32:35
you really are the worst type of asshole. you have access to both with your account...i assume people who use coinbase know about the gdax trading platform
now fuck off

nope. this is a deflationary global currency with network effects that currently has a fraction of the market cap of gold / other assets that it is compared to (in terms of value), as it continues to scale and grow, a logarithmic growth trend isn't unrealistic. it is quite volatile though, but overtime that should become less of any issue (hopefully)

@_date: 2018-01-30 21:43:47
i mostly mean educating yourself on the tech behind the coins, the actors, the history, and critically thinking about why the piece of information you are currently consuming is relevant or bullshit, its a challenge, as there are many sources of "authority", but you need to be able to discern intentions/motives behind this information, and yes, ultimately deciding for yourself, not just buying into cult think or dismissing something that might be valid, etc....i hope that answers your question

lol cuck... so who do you think surpassing btc then? if you're not shilling for bcash -- you sound like every other person shouting FUD, yet fail to look at the development currently happening on the platform

what big company is going to create a decentralized coin? FB, google, apple..? nah. it's not in their best interest, as those platforms, and almost all major tech giants profit from their centralization. doesn't mean people won't adopt it, but it won't be decentralized.

@_date: 2018-01-24 07:07:37
why?...the day before the next futures expire? (26th is set at $10.9K i believe)
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:41:45
the fact you couldn't see the value in math at the time leads me to believe it probably wouldn't have mattered much...
but sure, would be nice
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:13:29
best one so far imo
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:02:45
this is easier, just gotta make sure to move off anything you're not using to cold storage -- don't need to be leaving those funds on an exchange

It would be a huge blow if something like that did happen, but things would eventually recover.

You could do that too -- just saying it'd be nice if they allowed BCH/BTC freely like every other coin on CB. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:01:30
its okay to trust him, as hes proven himself to truly care about bitcoins real potential, but dont just follow the man, do your own research and think for yourself. he encourages that.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:11:45
Are you not aware of the ability to do this on Coinbase/GDAX (unless you're calling me on the semantics of Coinbase, and not specifically saying GDAX...)? -- or, unless somehow i'm misunderstanding you, literally --

if you care about the tech, then you would have realized this when you "invested" in it. but it's clear most people here don't and never did.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:07
I'm literally saying no one has authority in this space, or great "insights" that some users claim to have... and they shouldn't pretend that they do! I'm not making claims that I do. Jesus, you seem dense.
edit: The difference is I don't pretend to know anything, whereas they do by making definitive claims, predictions, etc...this is the clear distinction, embrace the ignorance and try to educate yourself, don't make wild claims or predictions based on fear and ignorance.

The point is, the scalability solutions are in their infancy, similar to how the internet hit walls as it scaled to reach a mass audience. Robust and mature solutions are being developed to handle fees &amp; on-chain transactions, and those take time. You can jump ship or look to alt-coins, do what you need to do, but otherwise you need to sit the fuck down. Your FUD isn't grounded in real knowledge, it's not helping, and you sound like a fucking idiot with your absolutes &amp; predictions.

It has, but be more condescending you dumb cunt. Has it occurred to you the ramifications of changing the block size or any of these other proposed band-aid solutions might hurt Bitcoin in the long-term? These "temporary" solutions don't come without consequence, and ruining the network for a short-term fix will be more detrimental than working through the current growing pains Bitcoin is experiencing. The issue of scaling will require real, permanent solutions, not temporary ones.

nah, what are you basing this on...? the hashrate has consistency gone up even in the roughest bear markets, it was no different back in '14
[ \-\- please back up your claims with some form of factual basis
the hashrate actually dropped a good bit before the nov 17 runup..this is not corollary 
@_date: 2018-06-09 09:54:59
Push to the top, this is more important than another price prophecy or wild prediction!

This isn't a casino, the same rules do not apply.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:19:40
Thanks for the downvote.
First of all, no TA. Just a graph of the history of the hashrate of bitcoin, cold hard facts.
You can have your opinion about the value of bitcoin, that's fine. I'm simply pointing out that the hashrate never "bottomed out" in any previous bear markets and shouldn't be used as an indicator that we've reached a bottom. There is no substantial proof to back up your claim.
Please educate yourself before making these claims, you ignorant fuck.

Up this goes -- this is fucking incredible!

Gets in late 2017 / early 2018, expects lambo, doesn't get it right away, points fingers.
Also, you're not using Stockholm Syndrome correctly. No one is forced to be here / buy bitcoin, might want to look that one up buddy.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:15:09
I wish more people paid attention to this kind of thing, the fools dumping their coins at these criminal lows will regret it when these institutional onramps come online \-\- and we'll hear the similar stories to '13/14, but the sentiment is that we won't recover, so some feel justified in selling now, versus waiting for this to bottom out \-\- yet the technicals have only improved and continue to...
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:04:16
Snagged a little more at 6.3, thanks to whoever sold \-\- will continue to buy on down each resistance level we hit

Will do -- hope you don't miss out
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:25:31
You're proving that guys point, at this moment yes, but be patient, it'll happen faster than you think.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:59:36
i think that depends on timing, your view of value, and your intentions with said currency. i personally don't plan to cash out to inflationary fiat as i have high hopes for btc -- to each his own though, right?
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:55:17
yeah, no one here is suggesting that you do, it sucks when that happens, but newbies and people make mistakes -- and you can hodl or cash out and cut your losses, i choose to hodl
but i didn't buy anywhere near aths :)

eth is not better
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:34:29
thank you. this.
this market is heavily manipulated, and unregulated, with huge players already involved, you'd have to be a fool to think otherwise.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:42:59
Nothing is better than btc, or likely will be any time soon. The progress/innovation being made on btc is staggering compared to all other cryptos..
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:33:16
Thank you -- a quick search could have answered their question, but instead they just spew general information
@_date: 2018-03-23 05:15:13
like the title, i think that number is a slight overestimate :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:26:26
my experience trading...and thats great man, i explained my reasoning above, but good luck to you. theres always the possibility to make more

The comment section gave me cancer though.

was wondering the same, no growth, something must be broken
edit: why was i downvoted? something is wrong on that site..
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:40:08
this was about whats better, eth has its qualities..
btc is decentralized. eth has had major security issues, btc does not, it has never been hacked. btcs hashrate is significantly higher, btc scalability has proven resilient in ways eth has not (kitty kitty), eth is hard forking to pos, market cap is not a fair metric when eth has 5x the supply. and the btc tx fee spiked because of spamming (back down to a fraction of what it was), eth had similar txfee issues with kitties. lightning, and various other layer 2 solutions are being developed for btc, of which are faster and cheaper than eth under any circumstance. you can argue at this moment that eth has advantages, but as tier 2 solutions scale, this will completely shut down any comparison. btc also has better devs, but this is arguably subjective
so no, eth is not better. btc is the metric we measure crypto, btc is the brand name, not eth.

security, scalability, hashrate, pow to pos (now), etc.. need i go on?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:25:18
i would agree when it comes to privacy, yes, xmr is doing great things and i'm also excited for future developments, but otherwise, in every other area, it has not been tested anywhere the extent that btc has, so it's incredibly premature to say that this coin is out innovating btc
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:42:49
Another "bitcoin isn't innovating fud troll"...Please tell us, what other cryptos?
The amount of tech that's going into into Lightning alone is incredible. The use of hash time locked contracts (HTLCs) is the most sophisticated, and technologically advanced use of smart contracts seen the entire cryptocurrency space so far, and this is currently being rolled out on the mainnet for bitcoin.
No other alt-coin has as anywhere near the technical innovation that Bitcoin does right now.
But please, do tell..
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:46:53
well an internet stranger's guarantee versus my own experience clearly means more. thanks. good luck with your 4%
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:33:33
eth is moving over to pos, had difficulty with scale just the same, and btc hasn't experienced the same security vulnerabilities eth has. i like both, but btc &gt; eth esp. with tier 2 tech incoming

This is common, welcome to show. If you got scared hands, it's best to walk away now.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:51:10
sure, not suggesting adding more atm, but i believe in the tech, so i don't mind taking the risk with what i do have, and that's the mentality behind hodl -- but you have every right not to, go ahead, cash out if you don't think it'll ever reach aths again
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:16:08
"i got caught talking shit, oh wait, relate to them, hodl!!"
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:55:36
Agreed, however, it's unfortunate that this will scare people that otherwise might benefit from the lower entry points to create more diversity -- their loss i suppose
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:39:32
was just thinking that -- will be fun to repost 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:19:46
nah. they've been promising the community this for quite some time, but prioritized Bcash over this when the mempool was filling up &amp; tx fees we're skyrocketing. fuck off.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:07:17
lol, is he really lying about the cash out/retirement based on his history? if so, that's sad.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:43:10
the price to mine a single btc is much higher, no incentive for miners, that alone would drive the price into the low thousands -- if value is being attributed for the pow
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:21:39
i appreciate the discussion, it made me think about out why i support btc in the first place, and i don't mean to come across as one of those people who thinks eth has no value / shitcoin, etc... i hope for the best for the platform and want to see it succeed, and i also believe there is plenty of room for other cryptos in this space
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:34:28
yup, so time for you to leave. bye now

@_date: 2018-02-01 04:09:10
sure, and if i was certain of the cycles, i might do more trading. i have made a little with trading, but the unpredictability, and horror stories i've read leads me to hodl onto what i have. i could always own more, but i can always lose a lot more too. if you're having success timing the cycles or are making a killing with trading, cheers

@_date: 2018-04-05 20:03:25
i can’t stand the rhetoric that evolves from this type of thing (specifically that article). if you want privacy, you’re a criminal, no. i just don’t want a bank or other centralized entity snooping/tracking how i choose to spend MY money — it’s already bad enough we’re going through KYC exchanges to buy these currencies.
i think this is a bad thing, but not unexpected.
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:18:14
short term gains yes, long term (1+ year) can be between 10-15% or at least considerably less
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:04:16
Yeah, this needs to be more professionally curated for it to have any credibility. This is hilarious, but easy to write off as a weak attempt at character defamation, and I doubt it would sway anyone new into questioning his character.

@_date: 2018-04-05 20:04:39
that seems to be the message here, if you can help "tame" bitcoin, you will be handsomely rewarded by the old institutions. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:37:57
its not a scam fork, etc... its the open source bitcoin client software or essentially the implementation of bitcoin -- named core to distinguish it from the network

possibly, but that's highly speculative, and we can't conclusively say that they did, or that was one of the true causes for this downward pressure. but sure, we're all guessing here, so why the fuck not
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:08:36
Just sounds like more attempts to suppress the price so that institutional money can continue to buy as cheaply as possible (if all the latest headlines about large companies, hedge funds, soros, etc.. getting into the game / pushing their positions are true) -- was porn, and pedos a few weeks ago, now it's drugs, rinse and repeat
