"I'm going to start a business but it has to make me rich first then I'll work hard. I'm not going to work hard first and reap the rewards later" ....said no successfull businessman ever. Or athlete. Or any goal minded person. Even a gold digger has to a suck dick.

I'm very much pro bitcoin. However if it was created by the NSa they have cleverly made us want a one world currency rather than forcing us to accept it.

Hey now. We need to get down to root of the problem. The problem is not bit coin. Terrorists are breathing oxygen. Every single one of those fuckers are breathing air and drinking water. Some of those sick fuck wear shoes and drive cars. Banning this air stuff and water shit is really what dod needs to be focused on.

It's also zero if you cash out less than 75k if youheld it long enough.

It's not a company, it's the internet.

I bought at $80 $130 $150 and $270. Then I quit paying attention to bitcoin after the MT.Gox horseshit. Then I saw the gif of the Indian guy dancing in some bollywood movie at $4000. 
Now I'm building a house on some land I bought a few years ago and I still have over half of my crypto........
I feel for ya, I remember these posts from when it hit $1200 for the first time. Suicide help line posts etc. Don't get worked up guys. And don't play with more than you can afford to lose.
I didnt even know about all the fighting over segwit and stuff until now.

I just provided the passwords I used on all my old wallets. I was only one character off: $
My passwords were 10 to 15 characters long. Combo of letters, capital and lower case, numbers and symbols. No words just randomly put together. 
Letters like 5 S s and o O 0 I made certain I grouped them near each other wrote them as perfectly as possible so I wouldn't confuse myself.

The bitcoin paranoid app installed on my android phone is configured to annoy the shit out of me if the price moves more than 3%. So I didn't miss the launch.

Awesome! I wish I had read more into it when I first heard about them. Back then, there was no way I would've bought "magic internet money" with "real money" but I would've have tried mining them. I have several PCs and graphics cards laying around that could have made 1,000s of bitcoins early on. But probably would've happily sold them at $10 or $20 a piece. When I first hear about them I immediately thought scam......damn it!

When thinking of my user name for reddit I chose reca because my monitor at the time was an Acer and my keyboard/mouse was a Logitech. recalogiteck. I bet this fellow just made up a name from all the gizmos laying on his desk that day.

Bought at 100, moved into cold storage, too lazy to take them out and sell.

Well If my latest coinbase purchase gets rejected again for "suspicous activity" I'm gonna quit and start using localbitcoins. I've tried for three weeks to buy one fucking bitcoin and verify my identity. I'll have to drive 2 hours to the nearest dealer but it beats beating around the damn bush.
