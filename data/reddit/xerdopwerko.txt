Nah, it's pretty much identical to the States as far as I know. Prices are in dollars and everything.

Mexican HSBC cardholder here.
I didn't choose this bank; I get paid here by a government school where I teach. 
This might be related to what happened to me the other day - when I could no longer use my debit card to buy groceries or even check my balance on an ATM - because I "had made some suspicious movements".
No help on the phone, because I could be a thief. Had to go to the actual HSBC closest to where I was getting groceries, and when I got there for help, they put me on the phone again, and they hung up on me again. I had to show my ID to even get my stuff looked at in real time, in meatspace, in the actual bank. 
I had to do a lot of stuff to get a complete new card, and was told I was lucky not to have to wait for  72 hours for it. 
The suspicious charges? Two Xbox live purchases after using my card on Steam the week before.
This same bank let me completely withdraw everything from an ATM in a Tokyo post office two years ago. But go on the internet and spend 300 pesos, and you get complete, unexplained lockdown, and have to spend one hour proving your identity to get the *chance* to get a new card that may, or may not, give you access to your money, because somehow getting games on the internet is suspicious.
But yeah, drug lords can transfer millions on it every day.

Does this not help?

Even if I'm a Mexican Communist?

I know, this scared me and I checked the news. 
It's 21.48 for a dollar right now. Yep, we're pretty fucked, but a *massive crash* would be like those in the seventies and eighties. Even the 1995 crisis was less severe than those. 
I expected to see like 30 when they said "massive crash".

I still don't understand how to buy bitcoin in Mexico. :(

Arigatou Gozaimasu, comrade. I shall learn more about BTC.

Sadly, though, MercadoLibre is absolute garbage in many countries. For example, in Mexico, it's filled with scammers, shitty re-sellers and spammy shit products. 
I want BTC to succeed in my country, but MercadoLibre is only going to hurt its image. It is absolute fucking shit.

This shall be useful. I will research. Thanks, paisano.

Sadly, like Mercadolibre, Famsa is extremely bad image for Bitcoin.
Famsa is the kind of business that gouges low-income workers through hidden interests and costs.
Also, they exploit their workers. 
Overall shitty business.

Bitcoin good. 
But this place is like a cross between Rent a Center and a payday loans place. 
Not a trustworthy venue.
