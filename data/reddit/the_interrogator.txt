Find a (established &amp; reputable) company online that accepts bitcoin for gold, preferably in the Netherlands if possible.
Gold is easy to covert to cash at any jewellers/pan shops. And you'll get your bitcoin out quickly with little loss.

The way things are heading, bitcoin could well be worth $10,000 + especially as we will soon see the dollar crash in value.
I see bitcoin as a store value and as protection of my wealth (what little it i have) as it will be used as such in a financial meltdown, with the added benefit of potential profit in purchasing power. Same qualities as gold &amp; silver, just of the internet kind ;)

The Bahrain dinar is also pegged to the dollar. There has been mention of talks taking place by TPTB about de-pegging from the dollar. I've been hearing stories of people converting all of thier dinars into dollars (this was before the dollar dropped). 
No idea what will happen so I bought some silver bullion and a lil bit of bitcoin and ethereum. 
Just in case.

I foresee a drop in bitcoin price presenting a great entry point in investment. I'm your average Joe and seeing ask that's going on, I think I'm going to cover to ethereum and ripple until there a clear and implemented solution to this problem.
Bitcoin will prevail but it'll get a little worse before it gets better in my opinion anyway.
A temporary drop in the bitcoin will be good for for all involved. The network effect has to much traction now for bitcoin to fail.
I believe bitcoin will succeed and become an intricate part of international payment systems and prove itself as it's own currency.
