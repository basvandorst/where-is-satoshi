Perhaps you should become very familiar with the facts about an extremely questionable company before you vouch for them?
I would at the very least check out the complete thread (and other relevant threads) before staking my reputation. From my experience "really honest and genuine" is very far from an accurate description.

Good article CC!

Fair enough. Thanks for adjusting your price, I can respect that. 
As far as the clone issue, I do not support IPL so I find it irrelevant.

Yes, but if state is threatening the exchange will they risk prison  versus  giving up the passwords to wallets that belong to their clients.

The "unknown" third party signature sounds like a great solution. That would give me more confidence if all exchanges offered that.

You put marijuana in the same category as nuclear weapons?  Seriously?
Please cite any article that proves marijuana to be lethal. Marijuana prohibition is one of the biggest frauds ever pulled off on the people of this country. The heat is on the dispensaries for one reason, direct competition to pharmaceuticals. Marijuana cures cancer and provides many proven medical benefits. Marijuana was made illegal to discriminate against people of color and it was viewed as competition to many industries, paper, oil, cotton, and pharmaceuticals.


The actual story shows a much different picture. Those who voted on the legal fate of this plant never had the facts, but were dependent on information supplied by those who had a specific agenda to deceive lawmakers. You’ll see below that the very first federal vote to prohibit marijuana was based entirely on a documented lie on the floor of the Senate.
You’ll also see that the history of marijuana’s criminalization is filled with:
Protection of Corporate Profits
Yellow Journalism
Ignorant, Incompetent, and/or Corrupt Legislators
Personal Career Advancement and Greed
These are the actual reasons marijuana is illegal.

+10 for your method. This is the best way to reduce risks and the only method I would consider for any wallet holding more than chump change.
I just finished setting up an sd card with Razor-qt and Armory for my Raspberry Pi. I haven't signed any transactions yet but Armory loads and performs wallet functions.
Then I just take the card out, store it offsite and I can still use the Pi for other projects.
I believe etothepi is also working on an android version for Armory. This on a cheap android phone, or tablet even, with radios and network disabled would be ideal.

Doesn't this leave accounts exposed to asset forfeiture by state? 
I would have more confidence if the cold storage wasn't on US soil.

Bitfloor does indeed have reasonable fees, I have used them a few times, even after their hacking incident and I do like their service. 
OTOH I still feel nervous about leaving any btc sit there for any period of time.
Hopefully there won't be any more security issues.
I've also purchased from Tangible Cryptography, quick reliable service and usually offers 1% below the mt. gox rate at time of deposit.

He operates BitcoinsDirect to sell the btc he gets from Fastcash4bitcoins.
Here's the forum thread: 
He has a $500 minimum though so not available for smaller purchases.

Only better and more cameras.  :/    That's what's nice about little mom and pop stores that handle moneygram, generally crappy video security.


Either of which would be willing to cooperate under the slightest pressure from state.
It all just depends on the degree of anonymity you are comfortable with.

How good is the security vs android wallets such as electrum or bitcoin spinner?
Does blockchain.info hold your private keys?

I'm wondering if you also carry your fiat money in pockets with holes in them.
@_date: 2012-10-05 14:52:32
Smart man!
@_date: 2012-09-29 10:52:06
If anonymity is your priority then stay out of the banks and use moneygram. Like the others have said lie on the form. Tell them you have no id and why should you need one just to pay a utility bill. There are a lot of small shops that handle moneygram and have crappy security cameras.

Or you could buy the newer R3 for &lt; $14 with fiat already on hand at less than a 1/3 of the price he is charging for the older R2 and still keep the 245% investment gain you made on the  bitcoin purchased in June.
I get the point you're trying to make and I anxiously await the time we can routinely do that. But we need retailers to get on board for that to happen, not opportunistic  resellers trying to make a quick buck. I just feel that this will add to more negative opinions.
edit: GBTC has made a proper price adjustment, "opportunistic reseller" no longer applies here.   Kudos GBTC!

This version is much easier on system resources. I leave it running all the time now with no noticeable lag in performance on my laptop except a little when synchronizing.

It would still be damn funny to see someone in a ski make deposit though if it wasn't so threatening.


hmmm,  moneygram was only $3.95, bitinstant has a relatively steep fee of 3.99% though. 
For bank deposits bitinstant's fee is higher, 4.49% + $1.00.
Tumbling is a good suggestion also, just don't depend on the the false sense of security that it implies. Coins can still be tracked through tumblers, it just requires more effort. However, the more roadblocks the better, make them earn their keep.  ;)
