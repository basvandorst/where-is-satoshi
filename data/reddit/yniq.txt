It's a very big gap between the top nations and the rest, and Denmark is not in the top 10, they are on the 14th place if you look at the IIHF world rating and that is very bad if you compare them with their nordic neighbours.

Maybe some tacky hiphop car with dollar sign wheels, otherwise i've never seen it.

Don't you own a credit card? I use that when i travel abroad and pay around ~1.50% in fees for exchange.

Do you believe in this yourself?

You can take out the money in a ATM and pay ~1.50%

But how do you know Bitcoin is "the Google" of blockchain technology? It can be something totally different.

Great example, take the company that it went best for as an example, what about the other 90% that failed?

They work as a middle man exchanging your BTC to USD.

And yet most of you guys got robbed by rich sharks when you invested in Bitcoin.

Don't you get more out of a debate when you debate with people who don't agree with all you say? I mean what do you get from debating with people who share the exact same world view as you?

Agree, it's not immune to this problem it's actually even worse at this.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:10:49
I don't think BTC or crypto in general is the answer to this problem, the only difference will be that nobody will be fined for rigging with BTC, so it will be even more open to that problem.

You don't take out anything from the "traditional financial system" when you buy bitcoins. 
Because when you buy bitcoins you exchange your fiat with some other people for bitcoins, so the money is still in the "traditional financial system", but you don't own it anymore, but somebody else do. And you probably just got someone even more rich who pumped and dumped the bitcoin to you.
