You're going to have a bad time using prepaid giftcards anywhere that involves other money.  
Follow the advice of the other guy; put it towards Amazon credit, use it for what you like. Or take that Amazon credit to purse.io and turn it into BTC that way.

It may be faster if you also link a credit card that's there as insurance for them but isn't used for the actual purchase. But yeah, just using a bank account by itself it takes a solid week.

This is what I did. Even if you're buying over-inflated because of demand to get out, you're still salvaging 75%+ of your deposited which is better than it being eaten.  
Hell, if I know its blasphemy around here, but put it into an alt that has half a chance to do something cool still. May recoop your money completely.
@_date: 2015-12-13 07:39:46
I want everyone to stop and think about this for two seconds.  
Sure, you can go to an alt. Hell, I even trust the alt I moved it to because of the hand I have in it.  
But if I'm moving to the alt, then that means someone is *getting my Bitcoin, Litecoin, whatever*, overly confident that they're selling high and possibly no way of knowing they're sitting with no way to get out.  
At the very worst half of the remaining Cryptsy users are going to be bagholders. And trust in market exchange, regardless of site, is deflated as all outsiders look to those who can't get their BTC out because they were confident in an increase in value of their original holdings from the appreciation in value from the surrounding alts.  
Bully for all those that get their dough out, but you know it's power users and the savvy that hang around communities that are doing it, and not the casual user that was taught bad habits from the get go and never properly guided from them.  
Sorry, but "move to an alt" deals with the superficial, immediate problem solely for the individual, but not for distribution of users, of which their health or perception of it, is necessary for your own wealth.  
**TL;DR** This isn't the Mt. Gox disaster where you could take one hard look at all the missing bitcoin and missing cash and know "hey, that is fraud through and through". Instead through crypto to crypto trading with not everyone being taking advantage of and many users getting to walk away unscathed... it's bad juju, guys. I don't like the look of it. Not one bit.

I found it super bizarre when they converted the CryptsyPoints drawings from physical products to winning a pot of Bitcoin like a lottery.  
Of course, not nearly as weird as when they removed transaction fees... and added a withdraw fee.  
And not nearly as weird as when they knew they goofed and gave out "vouchers" for 3 free withdraws.  
And not nearly as weird as instituting a daily withdraw limit of $25, up to $100 a month unless you verified your account. Even though I tried verifying two months ago to trade on the BTC/USD exchange and all requests for validation went unanswered. Like they didn't want my money.  
Then when I decided to pull out I could only pull HALF of any amount I requested to withdraw, each time. So that used all my tickets, but now I've got all my "play in the market" Bitcoin stashed in an alt and brought back home.

Most musicians do not give a shit about recordings not made in their own home studios because it's a racket that locks them out of legitimate work or forces them to pay for huge, unnecessary overhead or subsidize other artists that do not sell well but are better politically connected to the publishers, before they receive even the first cent.  
Record companies existed to take advantage of a middleman situation in order to promote infrastructure to move product, but now we live in an era where they're irrelevant and depend not on market forces and the consumer's need for their product for their continued existence but on laws and power.  
Piracy advances the bankruptcy of these institutions with heavy financial influence in the legal system. Society and the concept of profit for work cannot advance until they are outmoded. Because of their legal wranglings, they cannot be outmoded until they are destroyed, much as a tick that burrows underneath the skin.

Depends on the musicians.  
I frequent a location that used to have live music and had a couple dozen artists that would switch out and perform throughout the day and night. Then it stopped.  
I asked the owner why and they said BMI was coming after them and told them that they had to pay licensing if they were going to have live music in their establishment. And he countered with saying that none of the artists were performing cover songs, they were all performing their own personal works.  
They said that didn't matter and to be prepared to be taken to court unless they paid licensing.  
Being that they were a small business without the deep pockets to hire a lawyer to fight this horseshit, they ripped out the stage and we've been sitting here listening to a loop of Pandora licensed for business use that plays the same hundred songs over and over, but protects them from BMI coming after them for pre-recorded music because it keeps tracks of plays for doling out payment to the appropriate licensors, etc.  
So, you can ask those musicians, that had an outlet, and had it stripped away from them because of a broken system.

It has nothing to do with legitimacy. It's about obfuscating the process.  
"High probability of being fake" includes legitimate reviews that swoon and instead pander to a lowest common denominator of allowing them to go through. Dummying up a review submission is standard.  
Try it. Pull up a random restaurant within range of your IP address with a prevalency of other negative reviews displayed, and type a few generic lines and incorporate "dining area smelled like piss" somewhere in it. It'll pass. And you've never been there before.  
The filter as it exists is for the purpose of revenue generation. To apply pressure on account holders. As meta as a it sounds, an actual site dedicated to reviews would rely on peer-review and other reviewers weighing in on legitimacy of each other when possibility of illigitimate accounts are flagged.  
That's not the business Yelp is interested in being in.

Alright, here goes.  
*As a vendor* I accept Bitcoin because I'm willing to accept Bitcoin and use it to purchase more goods with Bitcoin for the purpose of resale.  
How someone brings Bitcoin to me to do that transaction *is not my responsibility*. I don't care if they forked over cash at 20% over market to someone else to have made their money, I don't care if they were given it, if they sold drugs at market or did tricks down at the docks at the rate of 0.01BTC per handjob given. Nor as a vendor *do I want to know*.  
Someone has *something*, that something is worth *something* to me, I'm willing to work out a trade for that something with my something and because I've put the labor and overhead in, with good CS and experience I'm entitled to my profit. And if no one buys, then I'm not.  
But I'm willing to take cash, too. Or credit card. Or checks if I'm granted a plethora of personal information by which to send someone to hunt them down if necessary. To take advantage of a BTC discount isn't to encourage the customer to convert and "be one of the faithful"; it's not my job to proselytize nor should it be anyone else's because much in the way of MLMs, pyramid schemes and organized religions that's a flag to anyone with some brain power that something's not on the up-and-up. There's no point in doing that for Bitcoin or crypto in the whole; if it works, people will build services and markets around it. If it doesn't there's no point to it.  
Bitcoin isn't some magical Messianic savior by which in order to "be saved" you have to liquidate all of your holdings in everything else and declare your loyalty to the One True Satoshi so that you might not end up a pauper in the trying times to come; no. It's an aggressive alternative to the systems in place with an ideological difference in the attitude of how we treat money (pure value rather than a promise; exchange based on asset and not on credit in order to keep people indebted to each other ala Ripple).  
My compelling reason as a vendor is I want to eat. And be housed. And keep doing those things. So if you want to pay me in American nickels with the buffalo penis on them, yen, yuan, Bitcoin, gold, or sets of 10 of year old Android tablets, I'm down for that so long as it pays for my time to do something with that bit of value. That's my compelling reason; to live. If your reason isn't the same, if your reason is instead to grift or take advantage or exploit, then your reason is *irrelevant*.
Overstock, Tiger Direct et al. didn't seal the doors and say "YOU HAVE TO PAY WITH BTC NOW", but if they did, there'd be your reason for converting OR refusing to do business with them. But there is no point in those extreme dramatics in a world that moves so slowly and is so resilient to change. Much the same in the concept of a gift card, if I buy (or more likely, am given) a $25 gift card to Old Navy, I don't throw a shit fit when I can't use the $7.43 left over at Claire's. I wait until I can use it up, or appropriate it in some other way; or sell it for $5 cash to someone ready to use it now if I *need* liquidity now because converting *liquidity comes at a cost*. The difference between a BTC to a giftcard, however, is how it's *not* restricted by some corporation's infrastructure, and is instead as fluid as the systems you already know, but yet you want to complain about conversions that you'd have to exercise in the same format with cash, because those individuals and organizations are merely visible.  
TL;DR The Flying Spaghetti Monster forgives; I do not.

Uh, they provide a valuable service for people that want to stay off the grid.  
That's worth something. But if it's something you have to repeatedly do it's good to check with the seller to see if they have a "trusted" status rate. Our store does 20% for a first timer but 10% after we've got their trust (usually on the first transaction).

The entire philosophy behind Galt's Gulch in *Atlas Shrugged* just smacks of the drives and dreams of those of us that are cryptoanarchists. Somewhere along the line, though, we got tied up in tying 'coin in with fiat value instead of keeping amongst ourselves in goods and services, instead of a purity behind "your money is no good here. No, really, it isn't." we're already soiled with the outside world.

I think it's entirely the romanticization of NYC through the media, yeah. It's always NYC, though. You never see the rest of New York State proper depicted in the media because *it's essentially Kentucky*.  
I know I'm going to get downvotes or SRS'd or Subreddit DramaLlama'd for it, but I'm going to say it anyway. 9/11 was a payment of karma debt for NY. It wasn't necessarily about "bigger numbers" when targeted, it was about what they thought *we thought* was the most important, emotional take away for us. I mean, just look at television shows alone:  
  
There's a massive masking of the reality, and it's the most visible from the outside of the doublespeak++ when they make reference to drink sizes or taxes on cigarettes in relation to public safety, or the ironic declaration of the police force as "America's Finest" when the likelihood to be shot by one is greater there than anywhere else in the US.  
The terrorists did America a favor by devastating New York City; it should've been a wake-up call, a call to action to re-evaluate the things that are important and a unification of something other than to say "fuck you" to the enemy, because we saw how long that lasted.

I don't know, I've known "kept guys" that worked a couple of years but their spouse had the career take off and not them so they stay at home. Maybe the arrangement isn't as predatory, seeing as it might impugn what it means "to be a man" to the guy and might seek at every turn to rectify and find value or employment in himself or in his projects, but...

Remember that for awhile there Bitmit was down without any great alternative and even then people weren't keen on using their BTC for those goods, anticipating it's return to higher values, so the volume of DOGE going back and forth would be enticement enough, since someone who would've dealt exclusively in it would've still had the opportunity to turn it into BTC.

I found you information culled from the original discussion thread. The payment is directly proportional to the amount of data put into the fields because it's destroying information related to that coin/partial coin and transaction information related to it being supplanted by the information being provided by you. He explains it better:










Naturally.  
It's work and payoff for mining a coin right now, but, much like Bitcoin, it's very likely that in the future there'll be dedicated devices that will do the mining job regardless if only to just pick up the miner's reward for transaction fees.  
So sure, so long as that continues the blockchain has integrity. I don't believe using the blockchain for other purposes would change that fact.

Ripple is not a coin proper, it's a financial system that they desire to be built on the principles of being constantly in debt to other users. It's distributed computing and not decentralized, and having Ripple doesn't by default solve any problems with a multicurrency system, and if anything is a barrier itself from future blockchain tech from being implemented in order to facilitate decentralized exchanges because one organization wants the full responsibility and control.  
It's a pile of shit. The sooner it collapses on itself the better.

I'm not on welfare, but I'm on food stamps. I built a rig on credit nearly a year ago, and it's being hosted at a business that agreed to host it for a fraction of the crypto that it mines and that I'll cover the electricity through my end of the profit. The rig has already paid for itself.  
My goal is to have the rig mine enough altcoin to cash in, while it's still profitable to do so, in order to pay off the credit card debt that my dad left my mom with in the divorce and whatever is left will maybe appreciate enough in value to put me in business somewhere, doing something I can do for a living.  
In the meantime, I'm hoarding a few BTC worth of BTC/alt.


haha, McDonald's doesn't hire 15 year olds with criminal histories. I've tried. Couldn't even get something with a vouch.  
I'm not seeing the validity in the OPs post, but there's circumstances where something can be likely and kind of backs up that BTC isn't a "rich man's plaything" and can be the poor person's bank. Lack of immediate liquidity prevents everything in my life being an emergency that I have to pay for and keeps out of my family's reach until it's good, ready and mature to do something with.

This is great, actually.  
There's targeted and featured advertising, but that's par for the course for review sites, and I've no problem with them. Your company listed at the top? As long as it's listed as a paid placement (you know, like Google does for site ranking), that's fine.  
What Yelp does for income generation is sell you marketing tools for managing your profile on their site. You can hide bad reviews, edit inaccuracies and so on.  
The problem with this is that there are many people who will have good reviews on their profile, be approached to purchase the marketing kit and if they refuse, bad reviews start flooding the businesses' page. Good reviews stay stuck in an unapproved queue. Bad reviews hit hard and heavy.  
So it's an extortion racket. Pay us to look good, or we open the floodgates (or as some allege, pay people to attack you directly).  
But what should we expect from a company whose CEO *was also the VP of Engineering at PayPal*?

Absolutely. It's a service that's worth something. People on here express grouchiness that I'll charge 20% for a first time buyer on localbitcoins, but I'm:
a) taking time out of my day to do the sale  
b) sending someone to do the transaction for me  
c) if doing it myself I'm exercising some expense in some way; gas if driven there by someone, food if I'm biking there and will be out that direction all day  
Taking the chance that the person may not show up or will show up late without notifying us (which happens regularly) costs money. If I have BTC available for a shop to resell, it's not out of the goodness of their heart that I'll get a percentage, they have to get theirs, too, and they've got rent, misc overhead and an employee that's taking time from other store tasks to handle the transaction for something that, if there was a greater volume traded per day, we could probably justify lower transaction fee costs. Since it's a service of a select clientele, we're not there yet and the cost of doing it reflects that.

It's roundabout, but back when I was first getting into this at 15 I would list stuff people wanted on Bitmit (tablets, consoles, etc.) and get the BTC that way. I did that for my first 4 BTC.

That's incorrect, though. There is a difference between a crime and a mental illness. There is a difference between those levels of attraction of a mental illness to boot for the purposes of treatment.  
We don't call people who commit theft "convicted kleptomaniacs".  
As a sixteen year old I say, if *you* cannot discern the difference between someone older than 18 that wants to fuck a teenager or an infant, and don't care to, that makes you the sick one* because you are roping it in as "all the same shit".  
These distinctions are important. Dumbing them down or misallocating their definitions is just the same as, for example, calling Bitcoin "that silk road thing".  
Call this asshole out on his alleged crime (remember! There was criminal complaints filed but according to the sources posted in this subreddit nothing went to court! You open yourself up for a libel suit if you make a claim that's not backed up by the facts). That is good enough to discredit him without changing definitions of things *or making stuff up*.


It's pretty obvious why. I should be allowed to have sex with whoever I want to around my age and that be my business. Since we're not yet to that wonderful utopia (your state may vary!), we do have laws that we have to operate under. But for to basically come out and say that someone overage that has sex with me *is the same as having sex with a being with no possible way to consent* (where did he say this? When he said that Infantophilia [whose actual term is nepiophilia, natch] is the same as ephebophilia, same shit, different smell, insulting people like me to imply that, again, my state may vary, *cannot possibly give consent* and *am on the level as an infant*.  
That's fucking disgusting.  
Further. The definition of ephebophilia specifically singles out the age range of adolescence. What's an adolescent? If you ask the World Health Organization an adolescent can be as old as **19**. Yeah. So according to who says the definitions don't matter, fucking someone who is 19 is just the same as fucking an infant.  
Words. Matter.

I'll see if I can find it the discussion on it.

What wound up happening was that the Dogecoin developers agreed that the community was behaving like a bunch of gross, immature assholes and that they wouldn't stop it from being implemented because they saw the other potential benefits of it, but the backers of the protocol said "haha, nope, they blew it" and aren't dedicating any more resources to it on behalf of doge, but it's in active development for other blockchains.

And don't get me started on the Jamaican bobsled team shit. When the $30k figure hit, they took responsibility to it as a community and went to the media with it, when $20k of it at that point was the donation of one user.

That doesn't make sense though because if you're actually committing "an illegal act" it's a violation of their agreements with FDIC to tip you off for it, instead filing with the appropriate legal authorities and letting them handle it.

I'm on board with that, which is why I do feel a lot (little less than a couple dozen) of cryptocurrencies are going to "make it", but will be used in niche markets or alternative uses not immediately relevant to "currency for product/services".  
Thing is with the "testing grounds" argument is what does it mean for the greater environment? Litecoin proved workable with all the Scrypt derivatives that popped up but in end-user ways did it or anyone else do something where established coins like BTC would consider altering how their algorithm works because of how another works?  
I'm all for hundreds of experiments being done and individually maintained to prove their own usefulness and mettle so that others will either roll their improvements into their own or provide counter examples as to why it won't work for them... but a lot of these algorithms are just being implemented not for any large-scale-worldview-end-goal but to stave off the GPU farm drop offs and to keep them hanging on for as long as possible.  
When that becomes the only benefit, creating difficulty for generation for the mere sake of creating difficulty, it's hard to argue the sustainability.

Mind you, these aren't forum trolls or randoms I'm talking about, these are the main developers that everyone seems to hang off as something big and important. They're not.

That's when you'd, logically, cut your losses, shutter the site, tell people to pull their BTC out of escrow, get the fuck out of dodge, let things cool down for awhile, return later with a PGP key you gave out earlier to verify who you are and start again.  
The underworld isn't going to dump someone, who makes them money, for being cautious.  
Greed blew it for him. Guess we always knew that.

Which is *bizarre* since it incorporates imagery of a corporation *unironically*.  
If you guys want to plow through Yelp, find out what businesses aren't listed as using Bitcoin, encourage them to use Bitcoin with an intro packet, find out what businesses *are* listed as using Bitcoin and send them a "Thanks!" packet with a "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker, great, fine I'm all in. You have my support.  
There's just something *wrong* about pulling an underhand action on behalf of a corporation that's not going to be paying you.

Think of all the lives saved by plastic knives

But we can't have the perfect 20/20 hindsight  
That our fate enjoys

They missed what really matters about Bitcoin, too. 
The blockchain.  
Applied to things beyond currency and we might have something that revolutionizes content distribution, free speech, biological research, even the laws which govern us.  
Bitcoin is more than a group of people treating it like a stock.
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:08:59


We've discussed this on other crypto boards, too, that reason the communities can be weird sometimes is that the actual concept of the nuts and bolts, the underpinnings of crypto currency, appeals to a particular group at the primal level.  
This particular group? I'm not going to tell where on the autism spectrum the collective is at, but it's likely they're on it.

"Have you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?"

At our maker events where we show off stuff that we've built (3D printers, stuff 3D printers make, Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects, OUYA games and other apps), I'm the one that brought my scrypt rig and talked about cryptocurrencies for several different groups for an hour. So that's what I'm referred to as. Which I prefer, because I could be called a lot of other things.  
I'm just the token girl of our crypto-sub-circle of that scene.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:09:15
heeee  
Yeah, no, I just mean in the grand scheme of things.  
In general cryptocurrency marches toward a sort of genderless utopia, and with every advancement and as the community grows it reflects that.  
But then every once in awhile we get something like this that gives us a quick yank back into realizing that this whole thing is still something of a hobby of a predominantly boy's club.  
That's not discouraging, and I don't want to sink into the "there goes the neighborhood" mentality that many others fall into when stuff like this happens, because in the end this is merely a footnote, and in two weeks? I'll forget I ever saw it.

Good on ya!

You are one of the few, the proud, the pioneer that will disregard fiat value and put us where we need to be, and there'll be little thanks your way for it now, but your role is just as important as those of us using it in every day commerce.

Everywhere there was an opportunity for them to swoop in and stir up shit for their own benefit, there they were.  
And now here we are. Even if I had massive crypto holdings to try to help sustain the market I wouldn't throw them a lifesaver.  
Good riddance.

@_date: 2014-02-20 01:26:57
Exactly, but these guys don't get it.  
If we had a Galt's Gulch like society, we could have jobs, contribute to a community, make things work, a non-credit, non-hedging, proof-of-work with fair recompense across the board to everyone and all they do.  
Since we don't because we rely on predatory systems and exploiting others in order to make a few people LOTS of money and smaller groups of people decent money, Social Security and welfare is a necessity. We make it a necessity because we want to keep people in a disadvantaged state because it greatly benefits those that mooch off the government at corporate levels.  
People don't believe me? Then you've never been on welfare/SNAP/assistance/etc.

He offered us pork  
And he came out of foibles  
From out of a fork  
With the face of Satoshi but the heart of a Quark  
His buy in was six-sixty-six  
He walked up to the Cryptsy  
With Ripple in his hands  
And he bought off the geeks  
And propositioned The Man  
And the day traders were his harlots  
And filled their crevices with sand  
While the band belted "buy in at six-sixty-six"  
We served at the subreddit  
And waited on the trading floor  
But he bait us and squeezed us  
And said "sell now or be poor"  
Well, I'm ready to buy  
I can't take any more  
And the troll box is making me shit bricks  
He told us he loved 'coin  
But that was a lie  
There was blood in his out turned pockets  
And the greenback in his eyes

If Bitcoin will stay six-sixty

"There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws. Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What's there in that for anyone? But just pass the kinds of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted - and you create a nation of lawbreakers - and then you cash in on guilt. Now that's the system, Mr. Rearden, that's the game, and once you understand it, you'll be much easier to deal with."

Well, HideMyAss will certainly sell someone out in a heartbeat. We've seen that.  
If you're using a VPN to a SOCKS5 proxy, though, what ends up happening is you're connecting through someone's malware ridden dump of a machine or a server that's been compromised. Or someone that's being paid for their machine to be used in that manner. That's happened, too.  
For a subpoena to be helpful, you have to have something to subpeona. Logs and such. A repository of SOCKS5 proxies won't keep logs, they're disinclined to. A VPN service outside of the US tends to not as well, and may have a sort of dummy file that they hand over by default that ties BTC addresses to account names (which consist of random characters) for their own accounting purposes.  
I suppose tying that information that is on a person's computer for use to connecting to the service with that of the minimum amount of data they can gather from it can be what cinches it all together, but it'll take real world slip ups (as we saw with Dread Pirate Roberts and his fake IDs he ordered of himself) in order to bring that sort of evidence together.

There's no game mechanics built in like a dating sim, it's definitely set up more like a visual novel where the decisions you make for the character in Act I lays out the path to one of the five girls and once you're locked onto one of their paths each has a "good"/"bad" ending, some have neutral. So it doesn't weave all over the place or shift pathings like larger more complicated VNs may do.  
One path can be knocked out in a few hours depending on how quick you read, so on a cool, quiet night, boil yourself some tea and curl up with it. You *may* not regret doing so.

Also keep in mind that Ripple is intended to eventually be a system based on debt; circle of trust to continuously loan out small to large amounts to people within your circle, when someone owes them who in turn owes you, you get the payback of the loan.

They're terrible at just about everything, but you definitely don't want to use them for mining. People DO use them as low power controllers for their mining equipment, though.    
Someone did build a coin to mine specifically off them (and in grand Raspberry Pi tradition, made it to where you just download and dd a disk image over without you having to do anything), Slimcoin, or something, but that's apparently defunct.

Since this is yet another Ripple thread, I'm going to go ahead and get my Two Minutes Of Hate crammed in.  
Ripple is based on the concept of debt and loaning and not asset and work.  




  
I realize this was not a feature readily available or heavily promoted (never saw it in my Classic wallet [that I made, under protest, because of their association with BOINC for providing folding in exchange for mining a pre-mined coin [something that Gridcoin is doing much, much better] and that they ate, by the way, and now I can't retrieve [it was a buck or so but that's not the point])  
I don't know about you, but even within a circle of trust that system is infinitely abusable to the level that, if it became the predominant system, you *wished* that credit card fraud would come back and be a thing you had to contend with.  
Fuck Ripple, fuck anyone associated with Ripple, I make no apologies when, politically, I would condone that these sorts of Federaliso cock-sucking, market bullies should be drug out into the street, shot, and spat on. In that order.

Indeed, I could rig up in a few hours a site where you could submit magnet links into the bitcoin blockchain. I did such a thing with Fedoracoin and it works flawlessly, but I do need to sit down and actually work on site enhancements.    
The issue is that eventually lawmakers may equate that running a full node is being complicit with file sharing, since you're hosting those magnet links for everyone, or other such nonsense.  
The tech, the code, is changing how this all works and the laws aren't keeping abreast with it in order to do the minimal damage to the populace.

That's cool, without context it makes *no sense* at all.  
It means "Finalize Early". So say for example someone buys something and submits the money to an escrow account, what the seller will then do is contact the buyer and go "due to the value of the items fluctuating, I can't wait for you to receive the items before releasing the escrow for me to get paid. I'll ship when you go ahead and tell the escrow that you've received what I'll be shipping."  
It's a mitigation of risk for the seller but four out of five times it's because they're prepping to run off with a bunch of people's money.  
It is why true multi-sig is important, regardless of what type of marketplace.

It's why I say over and over: look, you have to treat crypto as an entirely different economy from the current one. This whole thing where people are clamoring to bind it to this or that dollar and cash in their dollars for it just creates a "get rich quick" atmosphere, it should be discouraged.  
Scammers are at least making that point very well known. We're trying to tie something inferior into something superior and expecting the superior to float it.

Well, now. 3 months ago I could've easily cleared the ... 2.25? euro a day with a 10Mh/s scrypt mining ASIC. But their problem has always been, since the beginning, a promise of payout at a particular fiat level, rather than being upfront about what their actual mined amount per increment was.  
What they were doing was banking on the higher value of BTC, raising back above the levels it was this past year so that people would be pegged at those low, low (in comparison) fiat payout amounts and they profited the difference while honoring the contract.  
It was foolish. Indicative of a gambling problem being covered up ponzi-style.

Yes. There are more Subways in the world than McDonald's which is really something considering McDonald's growth up until the Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation debacles where they had to recoil and play major PR defense.  
Also, Subway has flexibility per franchisee because, if I'm not mistaken, payment processing is the franchisee owners' responsibility and isn't set through corporate agreement, at least nationally. There might be a breakdown per region.  
To expand on the first point, the reason why there's more Subways is because McDonald's is more in the real estate business than they are on providing food service. They make an effort to own stand alone properties whereas a Subway isn't focused on acquisition of permanent structures which is why you see them more in malls, strip malls and the like, leasing their locations rather than corporate buying the location and leasing it back to the franchisee.  
Because of the respect for the franchisee, rather than treating them like a serf, Subway is a fantastic potential evangelist for this currency.

I did sell a pretty good chunk when it was at $1.40 last week in order to pay off some equipment, which isn't bad at all for a coin that's been stuck around $0.08 a unit. It's back down around $0.30, oh wait, $0.50USD, but I have confidence it's going to hit around $10 by next year. That's not really speculation, there's a project one of the community members started working on that could really change the perception of FTCs' value to people in the coming weeks.

It takes away the negative, scam aspect of Bitcoin. It won't behoove you to commit a crime to generate Bitcoin in this fashion, it's far more profitable to do it in the way that is the classic standbys. Click harvesting, selling the machines as a zombie network to DDOS stuff. To go from plausible to "not worth it" over the course of a couple of years because of difficulty increases means only good things for the currency because the rest of the legitimate userbase can't be tied in with this sort of nonsense.  
But sure, people can just go ahead and downvote me because I think it's a good thing that the process that creates Bitcoins distances itself from fraudulent activity simply because a Bitcoin is so hard to generate and so valuable that it can't just be done at a whim now.

It wasn't. If anything it helped reinforce value because the people receiving BTC likely spent a chunk of it on goods and services rather than setting up an account somewhere to cash out.

These days, yes. It's a matter of the scaling, used to be with BTC you'd mine with CPU then GPU made more sense for investment of raw power and FPGA made sense for the power cost and then with the dedicated hardware ASIC will make up the majority of network hashing power.
Scrypt based currencies aren't to that stage yet; an early adopted coin can easily be mined with CPU (I've even seen a couple of coins that were restricted to CPU mining but didn't make it) and now anyone that's mining them are full-on GPU. Much like like with BTC where dedicated hardware was built to task, for scrypt based there's no dedicated hardware that is feasible to design and build at this point, though I've been told by people that such hardware may be in the works. But the thing about scrypt is that there are so many different options to choose from:
And likely will be more derivatives in the future. Are they all going to be successful? No. Is it worth it to invest effort (including marketing/evangelism/real world use) into one you dedicate to? Maybe. It depends entirely on what your focus is. But if dedicated hardware does hit scrypt and starts blowing GPU out of the water, there's always going to be another coin that people with GPU miners can get the ball rolling on as a competitor.
If it's purely to make a little money and get a real shot at profiting post ROI, then you have your mining equipment pull whatever coin out of those options that would be the most profitable for you at that point. Some people write scripts that'll jump around just for that purpose. People dedicated to just one of those coins will frown upon it, but it's still a part of the process.
So it just boils down to what your personal objective and goals are. Are you all about bitcoin? Allocate your equipment to mine it even if it's not necessarily profitable for you when factoring in depreciation of hardware, electricity costs, etc. Wanting to build up another network? Build a GPU rig and dive in to a pool, getting what you can. Wanting a quick buck? I don't know if it necessarily can be had, though those people switching from coin to coin may be doing some decent short-term returns with nothing to show for it months from now.
As for multi-thousand dollar BFL rigs - that's part of the catch. I can get my hands on a couple thousand dollars easily from someone for investment purposes, but to order an ASIC rig from anyone will take months and while those companies are holding my money and making interest for themselves off it, is time that I'm not contributing anything between when I pay to the time when a machine gets into my hands. Even though ALL this cryptocurrency stuff is volatile in regards to mining difficulty, price per coin, etc., at the very least with these other options you're able to dive in there and *do something* now without having to wait on a promise for a mining future that, while you may see ROI with those manufacturer costs, isn't possibly going to be worth the work the machine will be doing after that point.
Rambling now. But yes, dedicated equipment for scrypt based coins isn't here yet and may not be for awhile securing the future of mining by GPU, and ROI+profit is a tall order when using the same equipment to mine for BTC.

Bitmit was great but is now dead. Maybe a revival if someone buys it.  
Coingig looks good but doesn't have it's shit together on buyer/seller transactions (has escrow, staff member has to micromanage the transaction, though. You may get your payout in a week as opposed to instantaneous.)  
I discovered cryptothrift.com last night. Haven't used it yet.  
Feathercoin has it's own market, feathercoinmarket.com, which, if you have any know how it's trivial to switch FTC back and forth to BTC in an exchange. Has escrow and everything.  
Or you can set up your own store through a Wordpress blog. Over at the FTC community someone wrote a great how-to that you can adapt to BTC without any trouble:  
  
It's a matter of clicking the BTC box instead of the FTC one (though accepting many alternate currencies isn't necessarily a bad idea!).

I can't remember how much profited, but it was a lot. Paid off the cards, kept the rest in BTC.

Considering Bitcoin has no chargeback opportunity, it's already a success by default with even one transaction.  
The adult entertainment community has everything to gain from Bitcoin and everyone needs to adopt it as quick as possible since credit companies discriminate against them and call them high risk anyway.  
And if the adult industries do everything in Bitcoin, we get a VHS -&gt; Betamax / Blu-Ray -&gt; HD-DVD situation all over again.

You don't hit someone with everything you can charge them with from the get go because dropped charges that you don't have enough evidence to see all the way through just adds to the public perception that the person isn't such a bad guy or innocent.  
If necessary they'll file additional charges. Count on it if he's "uncooperative" during the legal process.

I've only seen one credible company on a scrypt fpga and that's because they sold test boards to prove their chipset worked.  
  
Anyone saying they have an ASIC ready to do scrypt out there can blow it out their ass so far as I'm concerned; none of them are being open and honest about their developments and keeping in constant communication.  
It's definitely not the same thing, but, the Raspberry Pi? What kept people reassured that it wasn't vaporware? The fact that their blog was chock full of info daily updated on their progress. When I have someone I had been giving the benefit of the doubt for telling me "hard specs in two weeks" and I get it a month later and "ship by end of year" turns into 1Q next year, I get serious doubts.

Feathercoin started a market. They're considering adding more altcoins but don't think BTC is on the table for consideration yet. If anything you could naturally trade what you get and what you need back and forth on an exchange pretty easily.
I tried CoinGig a couple of weeks ago and it was a pretty painful experience. Each transaction is manually overlooked, there's no automatic process that can be handled between the buyer and seller. It took a week to go from knowing the buyer received their goods to when I actually had the money released to me.  
And now they're wanting to raise their cut to 5% with no site improvements. No thanks.  
I'm shocked bitmit didn't get bought to be honest. I figured people with deeper pockets would've jumped at the chance. I wanted to organize a group buy but nothing came of it.

{out of character post}  
I work for an individual who was a consultant that used to do computer forensic work for our State. He keeps in contact with detectives that investigate child exploitation and he tells me that there has never, ever, ever been an incident uncovered involving child pornography and digital currency. Those people have their own currency, and that's the illegal content itself, trading back and forth. To use bitcoin and it's blockchain with pseudo-anonymity for those kind of transactions would be tantamount to posting a big, neon sign over their heads and saying to come get them.  
Bitcoin is simply the answer to the question that police departments couldn't answer before; if the PR departments go on and on about how child pornography makes up a "multi-million dollar industry" - then where's the money, paper trail, financially successful people benefiting from it. They don't exist, but the way the media and "lol buttcoin" detractors treat Bitcoin like it's a shrouded, high learning curve concept give them a ready excuse for something they've been saying for decades without anything to back it up.

Some people will switch through whichever is best to mine at whatever given time. hasco.ws and multipool.us are examples of this. middlecoin goes a step further and someone is managing trading on the markets to maximize the profit of the altcoins you do and they do a payout to you in BTC.  
I do these, sell into BTC, and then buy my favorite Altcoin. It's been beneficial. There's a lot of alt hate in too, so it's not a non-biased look into them. Try looking around in @_date: 2013-12-28 22:35:40

Oh, I'm just being a smart-alec.  
The Reality Distortion Field.  
But if you were around to watch what happened when they were selling the FPGA MiniRig you'd feel deja vu. It was, again, ~30k for device at the moment whereas the vastly cheaper  5GHz jalapenos were apparently "just around the corner". It made sense back then to "wait", but it wouldn't have for someone who could see into the future.  
There's several reasons for a price difference, you mention availability, that can be part of it. Another part of it can be the division of their R&amp;D or other associated costs spread across that one model/model line in order to keep their own book straight before they put different product out there.  
I wish there was a straight answer for you, but really based on BFL's history you simply can't get one based on previous information because of their botched shipping schedules. Other than the MiniRig example. It'd make sense if pricing was taking advantage of "weaker but now, stronger but later" concept, but they can't even get that right.
