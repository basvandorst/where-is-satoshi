If you don't already have cash or crypto in coinbase, it's 7 days before you can get cash out of coinbase. You can buy at current price with the app, for a fee, but you can't sell or withdraw that crypto for 7 days. It's how they prevent a lot of fraud, against them, and against other people.

I agree that whales exiting is good. The more we can spread the BTC around now, the better. But, they aren't exiting. They were here before the bubble, and the price is still above when things really took off. They played their game, generated FOMO, sold into the gold rush, and then have been working the price back down since then, re-accumulating. That's what these spikes are. Some whales buying back, and then everyone else selling it back down for crumbs of profit. 
When they are ready, there will be another FOMO cycle, and prices will go nuts again. It's just gonna take a while. If they did it too soon, they wouldn't get as much FOMO for their investment.

The thing about blockchain is, it's all horizontal. The system is completely distributed, so there is almost no option for vertical scaling other than block size. And when you change block size, it forces everything on the horizontal plane to scale vertically. Anything on the horizontal that can't scale vertically to match falls out of the network.

Straight white male here. Was a B/C student. Never been denied a job i interviewed for. Never been in a real fight. Never been put in jail. Never been hungry. Never been homeless. I have been privileged by the circumstances of my birth and upbringing. Some amount of that privilege was luck of having good parents and grandparents. Some of it was that I benefited from my race and genetic typicality. College campuses have totally gotten toxic for people like me, and I dont like the way SJWs try to address the issues. But for me to deny the benefits I received by virtue of my lucky birth dice roll would be lying to myself. You certainly might not have had the same privileges I did, but if you are a straight white male in America, I can confidently claim that you have benefited from it in some way.

You should definitely learn what hashing is. That is a good place to start. I'll get you started. You start with a piece of data, like a string or a big number or something. You send that data through a function and what comes out the other end is the hash of your data. If you send the same data through that function again, the resulting hashed value will be the same as last time. What makes hashing special is that you can't turn the hashed value back into the original data. If someone wanted to find out what the source data was for a given hash, they would have to try hashing random data until they found the given hash. Because the number of possible hashes is so astronomically huge, it is almost impossible to  guess the data for a hash. How this is used it bitcoin is more complicated, but that is how hashing works.

**Bitcoin does not solve the wealth distribution issue.**
Rich people are still rich under BTC. Poor people are still poor. It benefits the people who got in early, like the first people who discovered gold in California. But that doesn't do anything about whales coming along and buying all the assets up, and benefitting from their pre-existing wealth. The only real difference is that under BTC, you can't print more out of thin air, and you can't confiscate it without the owners cooperation(or owner having bad opsec).

If you are tired of HODLing, then you aren't really HODLing. You hold because you know the price is going back up. It's part hope, and part understanding. I hope the project is not a total failure in the end. I understand that if it isn't, then BTC will be worth a lot more in the future. You bought in at a really bad time, and now you know what FOMO feels like. Don't FOMO next time, and don't FUD now. It's still a good time to buy more and lower your cost basis. Maybe in a few months, it will be a better time to buy. Or a worse time to buy.

Never said you were keeping anyone down. That is an argument coming from SJWs, and it isn't well formed. Those with power will either knowingly or unknowingly bias the opportunities they provide towards people similar to themselves, either in physique or attitude. To ignore this fact is to make things worse, at least for those disimilar to those currently in a position of power. It doesn't have anything to do with how hard you worked. Its a subtle expression of biases and sterotypes by people with power. If I went to Japan, im aware that I would have a tough time of it. White people aren't treated the same there, and its just a fact. The same bias applies here, but the difference is that we as a society would like to aspire to something better than that. That's all the 
SJWs want, for there to be a level playing field with regards to protected classes, and to have more comprehensive protected classes. People who grew up with money will always have it easier, nobody expects that to change, except the communists. They just want all the other things to be less of a factor on long term success.

I see. Well you can't really get rid of fees. Part of the money you are making is coming from fees you know. If you send your BTC to an exchange like coinbase, you can set the fees on the outbound transaction to some low value, but don't make it too low. Then on coinbase you can set a limit sell to sell the coin with 0 fees, then just withdraw the cash. That's probably the cheapest option.

Bitcoin is an experiment at its heart. We don't really know how this will all play out. Regardless of what it was invented for, we still know exactly how it works. Anybody can learn how it works, and then try to make predictions for how it will influence the world. Satoshi is still a human, and has no better ability to predict the future than you do. Even if his intentions are entirely altruistic in creating BTC, that wouldn't prevent the rest of the world from misusing his invention. The reverse also holds true.
BTC fans tend to hold him up as some savior type figure, who somehow saw that his creation could save humanity. But in reality, he is just a programmer and cryptographer who solved a problem(double spends) in computer science that allowed the creation of a distributed currency with no single owner or point of failure.

Well waddya know. The price dives and all the FUD zombies are back spreading doom and gloom. Where were they when the price was going up before?
The whales want you to sell right now, because the price is right where they want it while they acquire more BTC. They lower the price, then scoop up all the weak hands before they buy back into BTC. And they keep doing it because it works. But then they have to get back in before the price naturally rises, so we'll see a giant green dildo in the next couple days. The only way to get their money is to buy when it seems most bleak. It forces them to pay more than they wanted to acquire their BTC, and adds strength to support levels.

Affecting the market is not the same as manipulating the market. These spikes are just time tested trading strategies. Buy a ton, generate some FOMO to raise the price a tiny bit, then dump at the higher price. You get a small gain in the process. Same strategy works on dumps too.

I do my own research. 
I didn't say anything about BCH, and neither did this graphic. You're the shill in this particular discussion. 
Raising the block size limit is something the core team is not fundamentally against, it's just something they didn't want to do yet. Lightning is a better solution for payments because it has no reliance on block creation times. Most people agree that we don't need every single retail purchase to be recorded on the blockchain for eternity. So raising the block size limit only pushes the problem down the road. BCH is banking on the core team working out all the issues with lightning for them, and I assume they will integrate lightning sometime soon after BTC has it in full swing. 
As for me though, I still have most of my airdropped BCH. But I won't support BCH, because it's more centralized, because Ver supports it, and because they are using sleazy tactics(bitcoin.com and  twitter misinformation) to try to make it seem legitimate.

To preface, I'm a programmer but not a cryptographer. Every time i've looked into how to write my own version of some cryptographic protocol for my own learning, RSA for example, the first thing people say is "Don't roll your own encryption" 
There are too many things to consider regarding security. Side channel attacks, factorization algorithms, quantum computing resistance. There are people that study this field for their whole lives before being able to make meaningful contributions to the state of the art. These are mathematical and physical concepts, not just engineering concerns. The general consensus almost universally is to leave this stuff to the experts. If you happen to actually be an expert, then you already know where you fit in to this stuff, and you know how to contribute, and your work can speak for itself. 
Bitcoin is the "leave it to the experts" of cryptocurrency, and many of the alt-coins are the "roll your own encryption" side. You have people who want to get on board the money train trying to implement technology they do not understand. That's not to say that some of these coins don't have quality people who might be experts. It's just to say that the state of the art is BTC. They have the experts. If what they are working on needs this much time and attention to get it right, then I am ok with it. I much prefer it to someone just "figuring it out" without considering all the possible failure modes. BTC is the large hadron collider of money. We should do this right so we aren't wasting our time.

The underlying tech doesn't need to be directly correlated with how it is used. Bitcoin is a lot of things, store of value, payment system, settlement layer. If they support new functionality that makes its role as a payment system faster and cheaper while at the same time reducing traffic on the network as a whole, that is better than just a quick fix of changing a 1 to a 4 in some config file which makes the blockchain heavier and doesn't address underlying issues with the protocol.
I hate Ver because he presents himself like a shitty person. That's my opinion, and is only relevant to my decision not to use BCH.
But more than that, I go with the project which is more open, doesn't try to trick their way to the top, and has more development power dedicated to it, and has more community support. BTC git repo has over 500 developers, BCH has around 70.

It has 1 important utility that I don't see many people talking about enough, or at least not in the same context. With all the online information gathering and leaks that happened in recent years, it's no longer reasonable to punch all of your personal information into websites just so you can make a credit card payment for legit services. With crypto, I can pay to a service without them ever knowing who I am, so long as they don't need that information to provide service(AWS for instance would need to know something about you so you don't do illegal stuff like running botnets). There's no reason for Netflix to know my home address for streaming services. 
And there is incentive for companies to adopt this model too, because it allows them to spend less effort on trying to protect that data that they never really needed in the first place. And they no longer need to deal with the cost and difficulty and risk of integrating with CC payment processors.
So yeah, maybe it won't be the best choice for buying daily coffee, but it might be the best choice for the online equivalent of buying coffee, like paying your netflix bill.

Well, it ends corruption regarding the issuance of new currency. There is no single entity which can decide to devalue bitcoin by creating more of it.

Because they have to make the same decision as everyone else, namely: Is bitcoin a good investment? Rich people can buy more BTC than poor people, because they have more disposable income. There is nothing about the system that prevents this. BTC is currency, and some people have more of it, just like with fiat. BTC does not solve the wealth distribution problem, and in fact might end up making it worse. But it solves some other problems.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:34:59
But through our economy, we can trade that "nothing" fiat for food and shelter and entertainment, or even for more time. You buy a car with fiat so you don't have to spend time taking the bus to work. Even if fiat's value isn't based on anything specific, it still has value. At least for now.
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:20:48
When you buy BTC directly that way, there's a fee. It's not a tremendous fee, especially compared to e-trade, but it adds up over lots of purchases. At least that's how it looks on mine. If you deposit dollars instead, and then transfer them to pro.coinbase you can place a limit buy and get BTC for 0 fee.

Do you only spend dollars when inflation is high? You spend when you need or want to buy something. If the utility of that thing is less than the currency you are spending for it, you don't buy it. The fact that the currency has more purchasing power next week doesn't really matter, except for the fact that it makes being efficient with your spending more worthwhile. I guess I would expect people to be less wasteful with their spending, which will probably hurt sales in some areas, but these areas already prey on impulse spending. Like dippin dots at the mall. It's just expensive ice cream, but if you had to trade BTC for it, maybe you just... wouldn't.

I've invested a non-trivial amount into BTC myself, and I believe in it too.

Well, he reminds me of those huge fat-cat capitalists in old-timey comics. Which I guess is fair since he is reported to possibly have control of like 1 million BTC. The "buy bitcoin" label would be like him wanting all his BTC to be worth trillians. But he's wearing guy fawkes mask, so i'm honestly kinda confused about it.
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:34:29
It would remove the uncertainty about 1 unknown party having 1/21 of all coins in their possession, while being a mostly fair distribution, so to affect the price minimally. If they were distributed relative to the UTXO BTC total, maybe more fair? idk.

I hate the idea of property tax, because you don't actually own something if you have to keep paying for it, but...
If we don't have a property tax, rich people will just buy all the land and never sell it, continually getting richer forever. With property tax, they are incentivized to sell if they will not use the land and it's value does not grow fast enough. I would like to see a progressive property tax, where the more land you own, the more it costs per acre, but that would just get abused by people buying land through shell companies.

[This]( is THE guy. He's the current lead dev, after taking over for Gavin Andresen who was the Chief Scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation. Other people merge changes though. I see some people merge their own branches, after it is discussed. 
In a way, you have to trust that if these devs were tyrants, then there wouldn't be [so many contributers.]( And anyone is able to register a github account and join the discussion. But you have to have something code related to talk about. Github is not a good place for politics. But if you spend enough time reading what other devs are working on, and the comments they are leaving on other people's code, you get a clearer picture of how it works. In the end, yes there are a few people who make the tough call on things like block size. A camel is a horse designed by committee.

I can't predict the future to that degree. I can imagine the possibility that if BTC value increases at a smoother predictable rate, then you can price that rate into the loan. You might borrow 500, and pay back 450 by the end of the term. The math could be done fairly easily to pay back the loan with interest, adjusting for BTC deflation rates at some regular interval. This could make it so the value you borrowed gets paid back by the end of the term with interest, and it still ends up being less BTC than you borrowed.
I guess the catch here is, why would someone loan out BTC if they could just sit on it and end up with more. I can't  really explain my way around that. Maybe if the deflation rate is low enough, deflation is priced into the interest, so you get a lower rate.

How would a mortgage work in a BTC economy? Because of deflation, the amount of value I pay back to the lender would end up being greater  than the originally agreed upon principle+interest. Over a 30 year term, I might end up having to pay double or more what I would if I took the loan in fiat. 
And you can't price that much deflation into the loan terms(lower BTC interest) because it lessens the motivation for the lender to even loan the BTC out.

BTC does not address wealth distribution. You purchase BTC with fiat, so people with more fiat can afford more BTC. In this regard, BTC fixes nothing.

It would be basically the same as using fiat, except that the spent BTC would be worth .001% more by the time you get your next BTC paycheck, instead of .001% less, as with fiat. So I would argue that it makes people more prudent with their purchases. Could actually help the environment by reducing wasteful consumerism.

They would need their own ASIC factory and that would have to be secret as well. If they wanted to mine BTC regardless of cost, they could point government supercomputers at it, but that still wouldn't match the hashrate that ASICs are doing.

So, lets say it's true, and satoshi is waiting for BTC to be worth tons before he cashes out his 1,000,000 BTC. He can't just flood the market with the coins. The price would drop to approaching 0 really really fast. People would pile in, trying to get all his coins for pennies on the million, absorbing all of his volume and giving him very little fiat in return. Furthermore, a decision could be made by the network to fork off to prevent the transaction that spent from his addresses. Like how ETH did after it got hacked.
So BTC isn't a very good ponzi scheme. If satoshi was greedy(and we all are to some extent), he could start spending his BTC on things that are priced in BTC, possibly even land, buildings, companies, whatever. So he's got enough "money" to buy anything in the world, what would he even buy? Is it even a bad thing? Do we really believe he is the illuminati and will use his coins to create the new world order? As long as he never spends the coins from those addresses, we don't really need to worry about it. And we can see if the satoshi coins get spent, and people would react with panic, and the price would crash, and people would watch where the money flows, and maybe eventually solve the mystery.
Satoshi's 1,000,000 BTC might be a kill switch he can use to tank the price to 0. It might be a means of adding more inflation to the network at a later date, should it seem prudent. It might just be an address he can't access because the private key got deleted.

I just realized something, but possibly it's obvious to most people here.
If a group of miners control a large percentage of the mining power, say 50%, then they are able to perform transactions at 50% the cost everyone else needs to pay. This is because on average 50% of all transaction fees end up making it back in their wallets by virtue of 50% total hash power. But by spamming the mempool, obviously they drive up the price of what everyone else has to pay to get transactions through quickly. They can take up all the low fee slots because they don't care when those tx process. 
I guess i'd need to do some calculus or something to find out what the break-even would be, if there even is one. If there isn't one, spamming is straight up an attack, and not an economic strategy. If there is one, it is a strategy, and one which could be amplified by larger blocks at an equivalent difficulty. At first, it wouldn't benefit the miner because it would cost more to fill up the blocks with spam. But if that miner knew they would be increasing their percentage of total hashing power in the future, they would get a larger percentage of all tx fees, and would be able to keep spamming transactions. But people that don't have the same resources as them won't be able to set up mining operations as easily, and there would be less full nodes that aren't under their control, because of the larger block size. So either way, their actions, if successful, aren't good for bitcoin. 
At least that's my reasoning.

Buying gold is a huge pain in the ass. 
One way is you go to something like a retail store and end up paying a huge markup to buy actual gold. Then you have to figure out how to store it securely, and eat whatever costs that entails. You also risk getting ripped off.
Another way, and this is basically how you "invest" with gold, is to buy gold certificates, which is a promise that you have some gold somewhere. And you can either pay to have that gold moved somewhere else, or leave it in the storage facility that whoever you bought it from kept it in. And keeping gold this way means you incur costs from wherever you are storing it. That is assuming there is even actual gold somewhere, and not a gold plated tungsten brick.
Or I guess maybe there are gold derivatives or some shit where you are betting on gold's price. idk.
In any case, gold is a terrible investment vehicle, and is only useful for rich people to store some amount of value during economic collapses.

Well, even that is somewhat complicated, but I know what you are asking, and [THIS]( is the guy. He's the current lead dev, after taking over for Gavin Andresen who was the Chief Scientist for the Bitcoin Foundation. Other people merge changes though. I see some people merge their own branches, after it is discussed. 
In a way though, you have to trust that if these devs were tyrants, then there wouldn't be [so many contributers.]( And anyone is able to register a github account and join the discussion. But you have to have something code related to talk about. Github is not a place for politics. But if you spend enough time reading what other devs are working on, and the comments they are leaving on other people's code, I think you'll be able to get a clearer picture of how it works. In the end, yes there are a few people who make the tough call on things like block size. A camel is a horse designed by committee. If they had an election for every merge, the code would become shit very fast.

You don't get it. Bitcoin is like a ponzi, except there is no singular entity that can pull the plug, and there is no re-investment of the core assets. So the core asset(the coin itself) can't be lost or depreciated directly via market decline, and no one person can make off with all the money. The price of bitcoin is just a confidence score of societies confidence in the scheme. A measure of how many people want a piece compared with how many people want out.

If organic demand for some resource remains on a stable trajectory, reduction in supply necessarily causes the price to go up. Yes it will get priced in to some extent before it halves, but that happens at the level where people are day trading. It causes price swings and increases well in advance of the event. But the organic demand continues under the surface and as that supply reduction point gets hit, that downward pressure on the price gets lessened and prices get pushed higher.
[Look at this chart.]( The peaks seem to happen in the middle between halvenings. Seems like that happens as a combination of the supply shock from last halvening compounding with pricing in the supply drop from the next halvening.

I don't want to know about all that shit. And it doesn't even have a place in bitcoin. If someone wants to create all those constructs wrt bitcoin, then that's on them, and anyone who wants to participate in that. The core concepts behind bitcoin don't share much with the stock market as we know it, other than the word "investment". It's fair to call it digital gold, but even that isn't a fully accurate measure of BTC's value proposition. 
And regarding your original statement, if it were a fad, it would be gone already. The modern attention span is much shorter than it used to be. Fads get pushed aside much faster now(see: fidget spinners). 
Crypto is either in a bubble now, or it will be in a bubble in the future. That doesn't even matter. Internet was a bubble, and it popped, and it's more valuable now than ever. It's just natural selection, weeding out the weak and leaving the strong, and BTC is currently the strongest.

You aren't wrong, but I wanted to address something.


While true that the price has increased due to speculative investment, we aren't able to say if the price is inflated, or even if the price is high. We only know that the price is high compared to what it was, and high in terms of the way people think about prices  in their day-to-day life. Because it is a new currency still in adoption, we have no idea what its stable valuation will be. It looks like a bubble from where we are now, but if it grew to $200k then where we are now only looks like a second wave of adoption.

That's kinda the point i'm trying to make. Every economy requires spending, because that's like, what an economy is. But the economy that we have built is more than that. It not only requires spending, it actually requires growth to function. Population growth, expansion of human influence, increases in industry, more discovered and utilized resources, etc. It's hard to imagine a stock market where every company and stock price is the same year after year.
But logically, we know that there are limits to this growth. You can only support so many people, mine so much coal, drill so much oil, build so many buildings, before you get diminishing returns. There's only enough oil and rare minerals to make so many big screen TVs. Until we are able to expand off planet or make significant advancements in power generation, these limits are pretty firm. 
All i'm trying to say is that we need to figure out how make our economy "stable" so that we don't require unlimited growth to keep it functioning. Deflationary currency feels like a part of that solution to me.

You never noticed that lottery ticket sales go way up when the jackpot gets above $250m? That's not because all the gamblers are suddenly buying more, it's because everyone else goes out and buys a ticket. Because the asymmetric upside becomes worth a couple bucks. The difference is, with Bitcoin, if the price just keeps going up, everyone gets to win. And when the price stops going up as fast, we are left with a solid cryptocurrency which is also a good store of value.
It looks like a ponzi scheme. I think most of us are willing to admit it at least looks like one from the outside. I think that's what makes it so beautiful. It's a game changing economic device disguised as a get rich quick scheme.

The moon that we are waiting for isn't here yet. That happens when owning Bitcoin is as common as having a paypal account. It doesn't necessarily mean that Bitcoin has become the new world currency, or that everyone has some. 
Let's say for instance that all 21 million of some coin "X" are up for grabs. We get 300 million people to all put up $1,000 for a piece of the pie(.07 X). This puts the value of 1 X at $14,286.
With BTC, all 21 million coins are not up for grabs. Many are lost, some are not mined yet, and very many are just on HODL. The potential pool of buyers is not 300 million, but 7.7 billion. The buyers are not limited to $1,000, and can spend as much or as little as they want. Then you have lightning network, where coins are (from my understanding) locked up in channels.
So even in a fairly conservative scenario, the price is 3x where we are now.

I'm not 100% on the details, but the attackers would have to keep up the attack for as long as it takes to cash out any ill-gotten BTC for fiat. All the while, their attack nodes will be getting banned and their strength weakening. Once the attack stops, the legit nodes eventually end up with the longest chain again, invalidating the double spends. So the key is being able to sell $300,000 worth of BTC per hour without the buyer questioning the coins, all while the attack is active, and hoping the buyer didn't hear about it in the news.

I have some questions, and i'm hoping someone more knowledgable can help me understand. 
Say I have a wallet with 1 BTC in it, in 1 address. I go to the hot dog cart down the road and buy a dog, and pay with BTC. Now this guy knows the address the BTC came from. He can go and see that I have almost 1 BTC left in my wallet, and get his buddy to rob me next time i'm in the area.
And a second example. Say I have a bunch of addresses in my wallet that I received salary payments to. They all come from addresses known to third party analytics services as being my company. Then I go buy a car with my BTC, and I use up several of the outputs in my wallet, but to pay the whole thing, I need to spend a little from a big address with 100 BTC in it. A number I would prefer people weren't aware of, for good reasons. Now because all the txs are bundled, my 100 BTC is tainted with my personal information. Anyone can go look up how much wealth I have.
So the question I have is, how is this better than the old way of doing things? At least in the old system, something(VISA, BofA) had to be compromised for this information to be exposed. Under BTC, it's all out in the open for anyone to know. Am I missing something?

They are. This is due to the policies of the exchange, not Bitcoin itself. If I send you Bitcoin, it can show up as a pending transaction in seconds. It then takes about 10 min to get confirmed before it cannot be reversed in any way. With lightning network, there is basically no confirmation time, and the tradeoff is some additional complexity.

I'm usually pretty skeptical of conspiracy theories, because they tend to be bullshit. 
But it's hard to ignore the fact that as soon as the price drops, 1000 people come out of the woodwork just to let us all know(for the 100th time) that they think BTC is a scam and is dead and is never going to recover. 
Like, I think most MLMs are scams, but i'm not willing to exert any amount of effort telling people that. I don't go over to their subreddits and tell them all they are idiots. So, yeah, I kinda believe it, which is scary to me.

The standard unit of satoshi can be divided into subunits like millisatoshi without that much fuss, though it would require some changes in the network/wallets. It was just a design decision to make that the smallest unit. Allowing more decimal places doesn't change the value of a satoshi, it just means 1sat == 1000msat.

@_date: 2019-01-07 19:17:37
That wasn't "the big one", that was "a big one".
"The big one" happens when society comes to terms with growth based economies becoming unsustainable in a world with finite resources. It's not an overnight thing either, it's a systemic problem. It will always be worthwhile to invest in new businesses, because they can grow. But why invest in AAPL if they reach a point where they simply can't sell more than they did in the past? Combine with lower employment due to automation, social security reaching break-even point, and any number of other things.
It's not certain it will even happen, but it's definitely something i'm concerned with.

That's a graph of bitcoin hashrate, so that's the percentage of BTC they are mining, roughly. My question is how many mining rigs they haven't turned on yet because of cost. Manufacturing and factory setup has a high lead time, so they probably have a whole pipeline's worth of miners begin built, plus whatever they didn't turn on all year with the low price.

It's an example of how much value is out there to be represented by BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:04:09
I still believe it will get there eventually. This latest bubble brought too much attention to it too soon. BTC isn't ready to replace the entirety of the current consumer financial system, regardless of how people on here talk about it. That's one reason I agree with the dev's decision not to increase block size yet. They are trying to make it a slow burn. 
Imagine how big this last bubble would have gotten if everything in BTC was perfect, and everyone that jumped in started using it for all their purchases in Dec. It would have shot up to $100,000 and crashed back to $5,000 a month later, and nobody would ever use it again.

@_date: 2019-01-23 00:38:00
The value in BTC was lost because we all collectively decided it was worth less now than it was when we collectively decided it was worth more earlier. If everyone decides it's worth more again, the people who buy now get a greater increase in their value. If everyone decides BTC has no value, then it dies.
It's a strange experiment in game theory.

There is no requirement that BTC use this much power. It is like this due to competition between miners trying to get a piece of the pie. As block reward drops off, and especially when block rewards are done, mining power usage will decrease because it won't be as profitable to consume that power. Lightning network should also help keep fees down, further reducing the demand for increased mining power.

But it also goes the other way too. When the market is low, futures can allow people to bet on a price increase, which could drive the market back up again.
And futures might print paper bitcoin, but you can't use those as a currency, and they aren't a store of value, and they aren't pseudo-anonymous. They are just an instrument to bet on the price. It doesn't affect the utility of BTC in any way, and people are still going to buy BTC, eventually driving the price back up. Hopefully at least.

Then the companies should also convert their profits to BTC, so they get to grow their money 2% each year.

If it were possible to break into a wallet without the proper information, nobody would use bitcoin. With a bank, there is someone you can call and verify your ownership of the asset. Bitcoin wallets are fundamentally anonymous in the way they are created. You are big-time screwed and you will never get those coins back without the password or seed. It sucks for you, but it's a good thing for bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:28:59
So what if people here resort to name calling? There's plenty of other good posts to read.
And i'm at least willing to talk about ideas without resorting to it. 
The current problem as I see it is that if a group of corporate interests are able to force a change in protocol, even for something as small as 2MB blocks, then they can force more sinister changes in the future. They might be able to get consensus of the miners, but that doesn't represent consensus of the whole ecosystem. We have segwit, and LN is on the horizon. There isn't even enough transaction volume to require these upgrades. Confirmations can be slow, but only LN can change that, 2x isn't enough. 
So who exactly has something to gain from 2x? As a bitcoin holder, I don't feel like I have anything to gain from it. Quite the opposite. Just the turmoil has caused a lot of uncertainty over the future of the coin in general. Then it must be the exchanges or the miners. But they already get their slice of the pie from the miner rewards and transaction fees. That money is governed by supply and demand. Corporations are always looking for how to get more money for lower costs. That's fine, it's what they do. But there is no funnel to optimize here. If the miners don't mine, they don't get bitcoin. If exchanges charge too much of a fee, people will use another exchange. It's true free market economics. 
So I fully expect that the next steps in trying to optimize what appears to be a money printing machine is to try to take control of it in some way. Such an effort would require organizing a bunch of exchanges and miners and attempting to alter bitcoin in some way that people who aren't part of said organization aren't necessarily in support of. That looks an awful fucking lot like NYA and 2x. Even if 2MB blocks is a great idea, the methodology being used to implement it is a problem.

Let's be real though. The economy is a big complex machine. As such, it has control structures, levers you can push and pull to affect different parts of it. Unless you are anarcho-capitalist or something(and many of us are, i'm aware what sub this is), you should expect those levers to get pulled sometimes. Otherwise the machine will throw a gear and shut down entirely. We may advocate for the destruction of that machine, or the replacement with a newer better machine, but most of us are not truly prepared for the consequences of that. Owning BTC is not sufficient. I'm talking about food &amp; water stockpiles.

I think this whole example is not quite right. I agree that if we are experiencing 20% deflation week over week, that's not a system that can function. I don't think deflation will be that severe once it stabilizes. Given the rate that BTC will be mined, it can't be, right? Wouldn't that imply that the whole world economy is nonstop hemorrhaging value against BTC, and therefor would be doing the same against fiat if we didn't print mountains of it? Where does all that value go?

The very fact that an attack like that would debase bitcoins worth is mostly what keeps them from doing it. The miners are 100% invested in acquiring bitcoin to sell for profit. If they attack the network, any bitcoin they manage to steal would be worthless. Since mining operations are some of the largest holders of BTC, it doesn't benefit them at all to do this. 
They would fair better in the long run to just turn some of the chips off until the price goes back up.

When new coins stop coming out as block rewards, miners will have to rely on transaction fees. There is nothing that inherently requires that the network use as much power as a small city. This is currently the case because the competition is so fierce to get BTC. I totally expect 50% or more of the mining chips out there to go dark at some point. And that will be fine. The security of the network only requires decentralization, it doesn't actually have any requirement on a specific amount of hash rate or power usage.
As for the value of BTC, yes it is currently highly speculative. The world is definitely not ready to switch over to BTC as its primary currency, and BTC is not ready for that either. I expect it to continue a slow burn, increasing adoption where it makes sense. It is already the cheapest and fastest way to wire money, internationally or otherwise. Its pseudoanonymous nature also makes it pretty much ideal for paying for services online. Not because of its users trying to do shady shit, but now because of online retailers being the shady ones. How many data breaches has your information been exposed in? What if you could pay for things without entering in all your real information just to make a CC payment?
I hope you see my points, but maybe BTC isn't for you yet. It's coming though, and it might be worth looking into while you can take advantage of its rapid growth.

Well I think maybe an attack isn't what you think it is. The 51% attacker doesn't get to just do anything they want. If they change the protocol, then they have just created a fork. Even if they have consensus with themselves, they are still on a different chain than everyone else, and the mess gets sorted out pretty quickly, because we users stick to the chain that is being developed currently. That's more of a social consensus. If you don't want to use the chain with the altered protocol, don't download their wallet.
The 51% attack does let them possibly perform double spends, but even this attack has limits. Limits of how much you can accomplish with the bitcoin you currently control that can't be undone by whoever you are doing it to. If I sell 100,000 BTC on an exchange for cash, and then double spend attack so that the exchange no longer has those coins, the exchange is going to come after me(because they know who I am from my account), and try to get that money back. Moreover, the more you sell, the more the price gets depleted, exhausting the order book on the exchange. If you sell it OTC to some sort of russian oligarch, and he finds out you double spend attacked him, now you have a violence problem. Are you going to buy a yacht with the BTC? They'll just not deliver it when payment gets negated. So if I spent all the money to buy the hardware to gain the ability to double spend, I can still only spend coins I already control. Then as Andreas said, I get kicked off the network, and everything sorts itself out.

Isn't the volume that people base the price on the volume in the exchanges? If it was based on the volume that was sent over the network, then something as simple as an exchange's hot wallet changing to a new address would trigger massive price increases all the time. The fact that nobody would benefit from trading on signals like that probably means nobody bothers to try. That's my thought on it anyway.

Just to give a rough idea, assuming all 21M BTC are in circulation, the current $100B valuation gives a price of $4,761.
For Cali's $2.9T GDP, that gives a price of $138,095/BTC. 
For gold's $7.7T valuation, that gives a price of $366,666/BTC.

I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't think you understand TA or really much of anything about crypto. Unless i've missed something, you don't buy crypto on tradingview. It's just a site to view charts and draw on them. Because of arbitrage between exchanges, the price is almost always the same across all of them for Bitcoin, so it almost doesn't matter where you buy it. You just need to find an exchange with fees that aren't bad. Most people in the US start with coinbase, and everyone else probably starts on bitfinex.
And making small plays, I assume you mean buying, only helps you if you keep doing it for a long time. If you are just getting in, you should only be buying with the intent to use BTC to buy things, or to hold onto it for a while. Many people have lost their asses trying to predict future prices, so be careful.

It adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks. Essentially, if the 2,016 blocks took less time to mine than the previous 2,016, this difficulty will go up. It would be a major problem if a huge percentage of miners went dark all at once, because you have to wait 2,016 blocks for it do adjust back down.

No. That's the whole deal with bitcoin. You can't just invent more, it has to be mined. They can still lend it and charge interest though.

But that 800 has become as valuable as 1000 in that time.
If the price stabilizes, then this should happen at a slow predictable rate. Your rent would go down in price(in BTC) each year, and you'll have to eat the difference, but by that time it wouldn't be changing that much.
If the price does keep swinging wildly forever, I don't think may of us here would argue that it would be a good thing. It would be a failed experiment if it swings more than 10% regularly 10 years from now.

Pretty much, except for one thing. If everyone except 2 miners dropped out tomorrow, it would probably take a million years to mine the next 2,016 blocks. But I guess with only 2 miners, it'd be easy for them to change the protocol and do whatever they wanted with the network.

You didn't ask me but..
I like LTC because of how similar it is to BTC while still using different code. I think of it like a hedge against a critical technical failure of BTC. If the world gets accustomed to using crypto, there needs to be a failover system just in case. And it is just as useful as BTC, just not priced as high or with the same level of adoption.

What is "playing" Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:14:55
That's why we use exponential moving averages. If the slope is positive, it's good, and if slope is negative, it's bad. But price is just a symptom of supply and demand on the exchanges. If someone wants to dump, supply goes up, price goes down. Not much more to it than that. All the "manipulation" that people talk about is just whales making strategic buys and sells, to influence public perception. Then there's tether. IDK about tether. Seems sketchy.

@_date: 2018-04-09 16:35:42
I don't see why people are so up in arms about price manipulation. Of course there is manipulation. It's a permissionless trustless system, it's basically designed for people to try to game it. It happens in the stock market, and crypto doesn't have all those regulations. Whales can only control the weather though. They can't do much about the climate, other than hurting investor confidence. History has thus far shown that bitcoin increases in value, and we don't have a compelling reason to believe it won't keep doing that.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:08:32
It's a pretty good time to buy, unless the price goes down. Then it won't have been a good time. But then it will be a better time. Unless it goes up. Then it will have been a good time to buy.

Crypto community has co-opted the term "short" to mean the opposite of "long". You are long if you own the asset, so you are short if you own the cash instead. To go short is to sell crypto for fiat cash. It's not technically correct usage of the term. Is there a better term to use when comparing bull/bear outlooks? If you are long, you think price will go up. What would be a better opposite than short?
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:25:40

They wait for the ACH transfer to clear before allowing you to gamble with it. If you are only purchasing BTC through coinbase proper (and paying their ridiculous fees), then you can buy right away, but then you can't sell the BTC you just bought for some time.

It was, but unfortunately I had only started buying a couple months before it started heating up. So I was FOMOing through the whole thing, but I was at least restrained enough to DCA. 
Deep down, I knew it wasn't going to keep going up forever, but the euphoria takes the form of not having any clue what the upper limit of price is, and seeing your money double almost overnight makes you want to keep buying. That's actually something the keeps me hopeful. People were willing to buy it at ridiculous prices, simply because the price is what it's worth as defined by everyone. It's like a pure representation of value, but we don't know what that value is yet.

That bubble seemed more like kids educating their families at the dinner table. I told a number of people about it, but none of them seemed super interested in buying it at the time.

I didn't say anything about IQ, and that was on purpose. IQ is a combination of nature and nurture, and the nature aspect also has elements of randomness. Having dumb parents doesn't guarantee you will be dumb. There are other selective pressures that have significant effect.

I understand this idea, and on some level I even agree. But at the same time, I think it's not as big a problem as it seems on the surface. Speaking anecdotally for a minute, there are plenty of ways that BC can improve the fitness of the species. Think of a young couple with good potential for career success. Having an unwanted kid at a young age puts their future in jeopardy. They might have to drop out, lowering their earning potential. This makes the kid and any future kids have less opportunity to be raised in a home with excess income, harder for everyone. Same basically applies to a family that is already doing well, and has an unexpected pregnancy. It reduces the money, time, and energy that can be used to raise the existing children. 
Growing up poor introduces all kinds of selective pressures against you, like prison, gang violence, poor nutrition, and poor health. We can't simply say that rich smart people need to pump out more kids to outcompete the poor people who don't use BC. There's more to it than that. Evolution works on longer timescales, and there is still plenty of selective pressure to push the species to being smarter.

You can divide people into 3 groups in a recession. People who have so much money that it doesn't matter, people with savings and assets, and people who live month to month. The last group won't hodl. The 2nd group will hodl for a while until they need the money, but they won't really be buying. The 1st group might buy quite a bit, possibly to an extent that they all make each other even more rich by storing their value in BTC during the storm. 
The hope is that normal folks can capitalize on this by hodling.

I agree, foolish at least for the paying party to accept that deal. Unless they are smart enough to buy the BTC up front. What if the player agrees to a 10% discount in salary, and the payer uses that 10% to buy additional BTC. Then both parties win, assuming BTC doesn't fail.

Essentially, yes. I'm not trying to argue whether it is "right" or not. What I'm saying is that it is possible to make the world a better place for other people while still being selfish.
