So it's currency, then? Nice to see that established.
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:12:35
How does it work?
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:54:42
Utterly excellent, yeah!
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:19:56
How come the graph 'number of nodes reached in orphan race' shows lots of points at way over 6000?
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:36:17
"The right to write" , nice.

Could well be, long as we got electrickery.
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:10:33
You can worry about that in your next lives, assuming they be on this planet still.
@_date: 2014-12-29 13:09:26
I can imagine some wanting to do that because they perceive a status quo threat.
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:58:51
That's something best left unimagined.

Spite, prolly burnt himself on Mt Gox...
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:27:48
Could've been faster by using bitonic.nl ao, paying with iDeal and handing them the receiving address. Takes just a couple minutes.
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:16:34

Yes, they are the smartest people, the best developers, scientists, even. /s What's the guy' expertise, actually?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:33:13
Makes cents.
@_date: 2015-05-24 06:30:10
It wasnt:
@_date: 2015-05-24 09:22:44
Yep, and self-printed.
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:56:15
3333 euros, if they still exist. Euros, that is.
@_date: 2015-01-11 10:15:05
Question: if I look at the number of full nodes,  I find that troubling. Since they number just in the thousands, I can easily see certain groups/agencies/unfriendlies coordinate an attack on those nodes. I'd love for you to tell me that I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:00:07
They will when bitcoin is invisible enough.

No, it's about idealism versus greed.

"Code monkeys"? Good heavens, man.

No, it's not.
@_date: 2015-08-08 10:04:56
Depends on who's the one breaking it.
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:16:26
It matters a lot if satoshis are valued as cents.
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:39:26
This is actually just 1 possible scenario. Transition to another global reserve currency could be smooth, provided good will and common sense prevail. But that's saying something.
@_date: 2015-07-11 06:30:51
Well, it's abundantly clear why Texas has been marked as Hostile in the Jade Helm 15 setup. Just hoping they're not cut off at the pass by the fascists. Is Utah doing the same perchance?
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:37:57
Germany? The first country providing clarity by naming it private money.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:41:03
Buy Drachcoin and put those on a brainwallet.
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:02:02
Yes, anything over the dust limit. Currently 5430 satoshis.
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:00:46
They 're buying as much gold as they can get. With a reason.
@_date: 2015-07-12 11:13:57
That syncs with Jade Helm military buildup, converted Walmarts and 300+ now empty prison camps.
Bitcoin will thrive in unaffected regions and be picked up after the storm has passed by those who managed to hold on to their keys. Preferably in a non-Mad Max society.
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:16:41
Yeah, the bill, starting after 20:00 made it cheaper, but still.
And indeed, being unreachable, no cellphones.
I sincerely hope bitcoin will do well in a lot less than the 20 years it took the internet.
@_date: 2015-07-03 05:35:33
Not exactly, a warning implies the bank does not consider your money yours to do with as you please.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:39:26
Like all mainstream media, NYT should not be taken seriously.
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:27:18
Metal coins, aaaaarrrrgghhh!
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:29:52
So they use the word bitcoin instead of blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:22:47
I know what killed the cat.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:51:34

@_date: 2015-08-13 14:35:53
Secession? Jade Helm shenanigans?
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:55:05
Course not, they can't read.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:44:08
Yes it did, gone with the wind.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:37:37
What kind?
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:02:24
What they don't appreciate is the stupid smile he kept on all the time. It showed arrogance and will get him extra time.
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:42:06
Now wait and see if this particular No really means No.
@_date: 2015-07-12 16:53:56
I disagree, in an economic collapse bitcoin would be about the only currency worth a damn.
Besides Swiss francs maybe.
And Maple Leafs.
@_date: 2015-07-14 07:46:30
So, the Eurogroup is illegal, Tsipras and his mates are cowards and Germany rules. Oh , plus Bilderberg rules thru their proxy Dijsselbloem.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:20:04
Not that long, I fear, going by Jade Helm preparations and other similar shit.
@_date: 2015-07-02 16:58:14
I'd wager there aren't that many genuine terrorists.

But, but, he apologized so honorably and sincerely.
@_date: 2015-08-01 07:33:43
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:42:31
Yeah, and what didn't help either is a missile slammed into their department.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:28:39
Yeah, it gives what remains more room to breathe, it does.
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:54:30
You some hodler then?
@_date: 2015-07-31 14:20:18
That's uncertain. I can provide certainty for half a satoshi.
