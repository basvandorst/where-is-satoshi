And how again does that point cover the demand twitter should censor? Is BCH "CryptoNazi" ? Or even remotely comparable?

So you want a centralized authority to enforce what you or they consider the only truth?
Thats exactly what this whole decentralization thing is meant to nuke.

I do not wanna live in a democracy to your definition. On the day of the election 1932 12 ppl died. SS and SA troops did their part to terrorize the opposition. 99 ppl died and over 1000 where injured only during one month of electioneering. 
This was only one instrument to deny a democratic election prior to the installation of dictatorship. Get your shit straight.

Stop it already.
The election 1932 was on 31st of July. Some civil war like conditions caused over 300 deaths and over 1100 injuries. The SA terror was backed by nearly 400 000 members.
Like I mentioned before, U can get to Hitler in 3 Steps on Wikipedia. Try it and inform yourself before you reply and downvote me again boy.

Wow. I thought getting to Hitler in 3 steps was only a Wikipedia thing :D
In my opinion ppl should calm down with their Nazi comparisons. Especially if they don´´´  t cite facts right.
NSDAP said it was democratically elected the same way Putin or Erdogan say they are democratically elected. We all know its far from being true.
