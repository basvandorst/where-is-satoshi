We're talking about an asset in the absence of fundamentals - the fundamentals of Bitcoin were discredited a long time ago. Now it is almost purely a speculative asset.
If you don't know that the best time to buy an asset is when it is rising, then I can only say it's obvious you have no investing experience. A smart investor buys when the asset begins to rise, indicating large potential upside with limited downside.
This is because you have no idea how long an asset is going to fall or flatline. The primary downside here is not actual losses on the asset itself, but opportunity cost. By sitting on an asset for several months or even several years, you might be losing yourself 10% p.a. you could have made elsewhere in that time. Anyone who has done elementary mathematics knows just how important the compounding effect of this can be.

Did you not read my original post?
There has been hardly any volume recently. This means that hardly any Bitcoins have been bought or sold. E.g. two weeks ago there was a day where total exchange volume amounted to $900,000. That's less than a day in mid 2011, when $5.8 million was bought/sold in one day.
Contrast that to $62 million was used to buy/sell BTC near the peak, at a price point of ~$1100.
A few days later, from memory at a price point of ~$800, something like $72 million was bought/sold in one day.
**tl;dr most people bought in at the peak of the bubble, and no one is buying your shitcoins**

How long have you been around for?
I've been around since late 2010.
Many people lost their money/Bitcoins, got their sensitive information stolen, and their online accounts hacked after MtGox was hacked in mid 2011. MtGox was pretty much the only exchange around at the time. The stolen coins were sold on the open market, sending the price flash-crashing to under $0.01/BTC.


My advice in late November 2013 when the price was at ~$1200 was 'sell now or lose your money', and my firm prediction (which I restated numerous times) was that 'Bitcoin will go to $200 or less before ever reaching $1241 again'. So far, anyone who took my advice has saved themselves 50% (or in the case of MtGox customers, 100%) of their money.


That's funny, because it already is

You live up to your name, as I do to my own
Anyone with even a modicum of experience in investing or trading knows that a bad time to buy is when the price is falling and interest is high. A good time to buy is the opposite: When the price is rising and interest is low - because you've waited for the positive indication, and even then by buying in you're risking very little (if it turns out to be a minor blip and flatlines again, you've not lost much at all have you?).
In fact, whenever people are talking about an asset - and especially if it's appearing in mainstream news articles as Bitcoin has been! - it's the WORST time to buy, because you are either near the peak of a bubble, or you are still on your way down off one.
A lot of plebs just think 'The price is falling, I'm gonna be one of those smart contrarians and buy in!', only to find that they bought in the middle of a great fall, which then flatlines for usually years.

I read people here saying this when the price dropped to $1100.
Then again at $1000.
Then again at $840.
Then again at $700.
And so on.

The ironic thing is that very few people are selling.
If you look at the total USD exchange volume displayed on blockchain.info, you'll see that volume has gradually dropped until reaching miniscule amounts recently.
To put it in perspective, there are times in 2011 and 2012 which had more volume - up to six times as much!
It's not that people are selling - the problem is that no one is buying. No one wants to pay these inflated prices for Bitcoin.
Eventually the bagHODLers will just have to give up and cut their losses - unless you're deluded enough to believe that people are going to be suddenly hyped up to buy an asset falling in value and facing major threats (i.e. fraud, regulation, 51% attack, blockchain bloat, rising transaction fees, increasing centralization, etc.)

Here's a recording of the event as it happened.
Quote from Wikipedia (MtGox page):
"On 19 June 2011, a security breach of the Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange caused the nominal price of a bitcoin to fraudulently drop to one cent on the Mt. Gox exchange, after a hacker allegedly used credentials from a Mt. Gox auditor's compromised computer illegally to transfer a large number of bitcoins to himself. He used the exchange's software to sell them all nominally, creating a massive "ask" order at any price. Accounts with the equivalent of more than $8,750,000 were affected."

No, but I can show you my ICBIT registration email:
Screenshots can be faked anyway bro, and you'll believe anything that suggests to the country of what I say, since you're butthurt I'm making $$$ while you've lost 50% on Bitcoin.
I made most of my money in the cryptocurrency area on altcoins though, most particularly in Litecoin.

Cash is king at the moment (maybe not for Americans - where I live I get 4.5% interest), but I like silver as well.
Altcoins were good for quick money a few months ago, not now.
I'm not revealing my other interests. My experiences have led me to the conclusion that the best thing to invest in is something that no one else is looking at - not something that people are currently bearish on, like Bitcoin for instance, but something that is completely listless and unspoken of.

You can call me what you want bro - the fact is that your shitcoins have decreased in value by 50% over the past year, and there's every indication that the downtrend is going to continue for a very long time indeed (or it could even spell the end for Bitcoin).
