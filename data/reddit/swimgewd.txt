Well labor is people so think on that and then look at my OP comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:51
I’m right there with you haha

I bought at 9k, sold at 16 but if you’re a long time hodler and bought at 5-6, stay strong. It’s going to equalize at 5k before hitting ATHs in 2018.

I really hope this is sarcasm otherwise people like this is why you can expect a crash soon.

underpaying people for work and holding on to all the profits is wrong, for sure. nothing wrong with worker owned coops. it's about owning your own labor. just like how being your own bank democratizes currency, being your own boss democratizes the labor market.

Wage slavery is also wrong but it’s the backbone of our society. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:42
lmao right, like that's not more money than I'll ever see in my life, just for sitting on a pile of code long enough.

Profit is inherently theft of wages. All profit should go to employees since they were the ones whose labor generated the profit. This isn’t a critique on small business, more so large businesses that prioritize shareholder profits (aka people who do nothing) over the well-being of their employees. Besides, this recognizes that there are operational costs to the business that need to be shared across the employees as well, what you’re referring to as start up costs. Employees only do as well as the business.

Yes. If johns company is more successful, and he’s doing the same role, he must be providing more value. That’s what happens now. Some shareholders make more than others because their company did better. Is that fair? To anyone?

It’s not us you have to worry about. It’s all the finance guys who are going to short it on the CME pumping Bitcoin full of cash who are gonna pull out their massive investments to crash the market.

Bitcoin needs to be traded to get value. If those early adopters never spent any of their coin we wouldn’t be where we are today

Pretty sure it’s only haram when loaning to other Muslims. Totally fine to charge interest to Jews, Christians, Ba’Hai, Yazidi etc

On the U.S. Treasury though. Since Congress is the one that actually spends and allocates the money, the only thing it does, in practice, is restrict the Treasury from paying for things already appropriated for. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:30:26
It’s literally a restriction on the US Treasury

Issue 6: The debt ceiling isn't about how much money you can continue to be in debt by, it's how much money you can pay your lenders back. 
The deficit is always higher than the debt ceiling, the debt ceiling just controls how much of that deficit is actually, ya know, paid.

A large element of the Dow Jones right now is from stock buybacks, what's your point?

they have a long way to go before hitting apple
APPL: $935.89B
MSFT: $774.93
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:44:38
That's because they had a quarter trillion cash on hand at the start of this year.

not anymore. The incentive in the tech start up space is to be bought by the bigger fish. Which is still noble and provides people with jobs in the meantime. Don't pretend like we're in an actual free market where the people who hold the majority of the wealth can't just outspend the competition.

market is controlled by whoever has more money, because they're able to shift the market. Case in point, whales pulling out of Bitcoin. there is a B2B market too dude and that's driven by what Fortune 500 companies do. Some companies have SMB plans but the goal is create a product you can sell upmarket to the largest companies, because they have all the money, so they control the market. 


this is a miseducated statement, google and facebook actually spend millions to make their products more addictive. 
I agree with everything you said in your last paragraph.

Wow it’s almost like republicans ruin the economy so when they predictably get kicked out of office for their unpopular ideas they can blame it on a democrat wow

Yea at it was $7400 earlier this month. It’s definitely volatile this past year and got a huge boost from holiday spending, but expect a major correction next year and a bust soon. I’ll be happy if it’s $15k next year. But I’m conservative with it and I’m here for the ride
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:11
A lot of the growth right now is from a bunch of people adopting it over the holiday weekend and the massive purchasing holiday we are in right now. This growth is definitely an anomaly and shouldn’t be used as a predictive trend. That said, if it goes up just 2x over the next year, that’s insane returns. Fuck, even if it only goes up by 1 or 1.5 that’s better than the market rate for IRAs.

So don’t sell. It’s not like you can’t use bitcoin to buy shit like regular currency. That’s the entire point. Start transferring funds into it and actually use it to buy shit if you want the value to go up. If everyone here used bitcoin as currency instead of selling it, we’d be tight.

I thought it was a scheme till I listened to Antonopolous talk about the underlying benefits of blockchain as a technology and discussing indelible ledgers, instantaneous money transfer, no exchange rate etc. it’s clear that crypto is actually MORE secure and LESS likely to lead to money laundering since every single transaction is recorded and attached to your bitcoin hash. Anytime I hear someone talk about how crypto is illegitimate I immediately know they have no idea what they’re talking about. Dito when people imply Bitcoin is an illiquid good and not actual currency.
