You could try voting for representatives that aren't corrupt criminals.  Ever notice how the "taxation is theft" people keep voting representatives that misuse tax revenues?  You can't help the people unwilling to help themselves.

You should learn about velocity of money and how taxes work before you cry about math you don't understand.

Go educate yourself, you troll.  Learn the fucking difference between a gross cost of $3T and a net cost of $800B.  You're really making yourself look like a proud idiot digging these holes.

Being filthy rich is punishment?  There is also no correlation between hard work and wealth, but nice try.

Its the people currently *dodging* taxes that will foot the bill for UBI.  The top 10% of spenders.

He's shifting the tax burden from the middle class to the top 6%.  Why are you opposed to reparations for the middle class subsidies given to the upperclass for the last 40 years?

Following a ridiculous absolute with "be reasonable" is a bold move. 
Your anti-society beliefs are cute, Ayn Rand, but strictly against human nature. Millions of years of evolved cooperation trumps your dystopic teen novel.

You're calling someone that obviously has a better understanding of economics than you an "economic illiterate".

You come from an anti-government family that works everyday to prove their own bias correct. The conservative belief that government doesn't work is a self fulfilling prophecy.

This is about Andrew Yang, the candidate with the most policy proposals in the field— who were you referring to?

"Too bad he's an economic illiterate,"
Found the token Pot/Kettle hypocrite.

I'd be happy to explain it as best I can— what issues are you having trying to understand it?
The basic premise is that it is a "Negative Tax Credit" based on a consumption tax, so if you spend over a certain threshold, you either break even or pay net taxes, but under that spending threshold you will be the recipient of tax revenue from the over spenders.  It is a wealth transfer mechanism.

I'd love to be in the highest tax bracket; that'd mean I'm among the richest individuals.
I will never understand why someone would rather be poor and pay no taxes than be filthy rich and pay 90% taxes.  If you aren't choosing the larger end sum, you're an idiot, I believe.

I get that you may be rich enough that the VAT will affect you negatively, but do you really hate poor people that much that you're willing to destroy the US economy just to keep them poor?

What?  That still makes no sense.  Being self-made isn't correlated to hard work either.  Plenty of people are self-made millionaires from risky investments or sheer luck; and plenty of people work harder than Jeff Bezos but are still terribly poor.

Yang is definitely not a Keynesian economist— his primary policy is to move us away from keynesian economics and its fiscal meddling and he's also seeking to replace the fiat dollar with a blockchain-backed currency.
