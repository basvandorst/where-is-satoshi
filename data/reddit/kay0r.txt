With localbitcoins, you usually change it for cash, not wire transfer.  
How many taxmen do they need to check your pockets? I mean literally your pockets, not your bank account.  
Now, multiply this for *all* the people who are willing to risk this course of action and try to imagine the number of people needed to keep it in control.  
The more your government becomes strict, the more people will try to grind it's freedom out of the cage.

Supercomputers are general purpose, you need ASICs to do an attack like that.  
Right now we're around 80/90 Petahashes per second and rising. That's more than the first 500 supercomputers in the world combined could do.  
To my knowledge, in the US there is only one foundry could build ASICs efficiently and that's Globalfoundries, but i don't even know if the plant is built to produce ASICs.  
When you are using a private company like that it will spread very fast, and IT WILL be known in a matter of days or weeks, thus the attack will be nearly useless.

That's almost true.  
There are slight differences in the equipment to produce CPUs/GPUs/FPGAs and ASICs.  
Generally, since it costs billions to build one, a foundry is designed to be easily repurposed for another kind of silicon product(s).

Is the US$/AU$ pair being taxed when exchanged?  
If not they can't apply this upcoming law, would be double taxing.  
They can try to tax bitcoin as an IT service, but they can't since it is used as a currency.  
Even GB tried to suggest a VAT like tax thru their legislators.  
They're just scared of tax evaders.  
If this becomes law, AUS bitcoin black market will be HUGE.
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:50:41
I mean that if a foundry is built to produce mainly GPUs it needs to be slightly repurposed to build ASICs, so you need to spend more than acquiring ASICs from another foundry wich already can produce it.  
And this is related to the conversation, since if the U.S. or any other country needs to disrupt the blockchain, it needs to acquire ASICs from a private company, potentially triggering an alarm.  
Right now only China is in good position to do that.

I wasn't denying what you're saying, just pointing out flaws in their reasoning.  
About the black market, how will they stop mining?  
And how about selling your BTC thru localbitcoins for cash?  
How can they stop selling goods for bitcoins if the same bitcoins are used to acquire more goods, thus bypassing the law?  
Trying to stop BTC is pointless, there are too many ways to get rid of legislators and enforcment.

Because, sooner or later people will realize that bitcoin, or something like it, is potentially better than fiat.
* Temporally programmable like wire transfers
* More secure, providing you have taken the necessary steps
* The potential to gain value over time even after price stabilization
Bitcoin is superior in nearly every aspect, but the incredible stuff is that the governments actually *needs* to be supportive of it, because it potentially have a better economics than the present one.  
And we all know the effects of our actual economic system.  
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:07:34
I agree that no one gives a shit until you do something.
But you have to realize that normal people just continue to do what they have done half of their entire life because they don't know how to do better (not talking about doing good to the next person).
They're just stuck in their sandbox and they don't (want to) realize there is much more to know -and to do- out there.
And even if they start to get their eyes up and actually do something it will take months/years to start doing that something just barely right.
There are people (trust me, i was one of them) wich are paid just because they know something, but not necessarily  have to be done.
Take Satoshi as an example: if he didn't coded the first wallet, does this would diminished his work on the white paper?

@_date: 2014-03-28 20:08:43
Yes, i know and agree on that.  
But Valve has always been slightly eccentric on their business, and in this case they could do something really interesting and implement bitcoin as payment, changing it automatically, and use the blockchain tech for something of their own.  
Don't forget they [own a network](

I believe the author (Mr. North) know exactly what bitcoin is.  
Some people just hate the idea that money could be something without physical form.  
Mr. North cites austrian economics AND praises the dollar wich is nowadays a product of keynesianism.  
I think he have few ideas, all of them confused, hence the quote.

Yes, to a certain extent he is right.

Law enforcement cannot eradicate phenomenons such as those described in the article, but using bitcoin MAYBE we could trace back the money.

Personal opinion:  
Bitcoin and Gold ain't currency but actual money.
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:03:35
Very nice explanation. Thanks.  
To me, store of value means the literal property of money.  
It means it doesn't rot, like leaves, mutton chops, etc.  
Gold or bitcoins doesn't rot, have "intrinsic" value (i use the word intrinsic for a lack of better term), they could be exchanged for goods and services.  
Gold isn't used as means of exchange anymore by the average layman, but it's still used as a guarantee in some cases.  
Bitcoin on the other hand have almost none of the annoyances gold have, like physical storing, transportation etc.  
But the most important thing is, they DO NOT represent value like banknotes, IOUs, bonds or whatever. They ARE value.  
And that's why i believe they're money and not currency.

For the most part you're absolutely right.  
Blockchains are very inefficient compared to any database out there.  
However i think there are some use cases for a completely private database.  
But first things first, i classify different kind of blockchains by their use:  
* Public blockhains = Bitcoin and similar
* Consortium blockchains = Private databases used by a group of entities
* Private blockchains = Private databases used by a single entity
While private blockchains are nigh useless, apart from the ones used when there's a lack of trust on personnel, consortium blockchains can be very useful.  
Think of a group of banks using their blockchain to consolidate money transfers between themselves.  
To sum it up, a blockchain shouldn't be used because is new but because of their lack of trust on the counterpart.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:03:51
I know what OP is trying to say, thanks.  
However i don't think it's disruptive at all.  
Blockchains are all about competition between parties, and IMO bitcoin didn't have any, until now.

Can't find what you're saying. Here, let me quote the whitepaper for you:

Then i believe you should rethink what consensus means.  
If BCC/BCH (not bcash which is a separate project) is indeed an altcoin, then it have every right to have its own consensus rules, as many other alts do.  
It was about time bitcoin had real competition.
@_date: 2016-12-08 11:15:26
Uhmmm nope.  
ETC is still alive because an altcoin exchange listed it, backed by a number of well known whales.  
If they didn't support the opportunity, fork would have already be dead, and perhaps wouldn't be even come to light.
@_date: 2017-01-02 14:19:31
Interesting.  
However i think there are traders that have made a lot of money out of rallies/corrections. If they have a model in their hands, sure they want to keep it for themselves to avoid exactly what you've explained.

I disagree, i'm not talking about public access blockchains.  
Settlements are much faster with a blockchain rather than conventional models. Obviously the token needs to have some fixed or fluctuating value.  
Moreover, it is possible to give full access to a third party and limited or no access to all the parties not involved in the transaction.

Huge failures are part of the 30% what's wrong with trying to predict moves of an asset?  
The rule 70/30 can be applied to any traded asset.  
It's just probability. If the probability of going down (or up) is big, you just bet on/against it.  
Is BTC price manipulated? Yes  
But thinking that manipulators are 100% in control is just naive.
