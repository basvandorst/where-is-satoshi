How unfortunate, but glad to read LBC locked the coins for now. I hope LBC release them to you once the situation has been verified to them.
But damn, i can barely imagine the frustration involved explaining the situation to bystanders and the police. At this time, most people are still completely ignorant about bitcoin.

You seem angry, maybe you should stay away from the internet for some time ?

Bitcoin Unlimited will never be Bitcoin. Hence the name Bitcoin Unlimited Aids.
Edit: That was well received, no ragrets

You underestimate bitcoin.

Only thing crashing is your mind brother. Keep calm and buy the cheap coins. Im throwing in another 1500$ today.

Your company is the best scam i've seen yet in the crypto landscape. Secondly you are the most dodgy person i've come across.
My advice to everyone is to get the fuck out of tether now, or what follows next is your own fault. 
Every man for himself, good luck.

Yeah i remember that crystal clear. 
I had 2.5k in my account as a backup while traveling. Backup gone overnight.

Not good. Wonder if other banks will follow ?
