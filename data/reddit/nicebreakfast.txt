You're trying to diagnose something like you're a psychologist or a medically trained professional, of which i am fairly sure you are not. you want my mission? at this point is to destroy his business, completely.
why? there are a litany of reasons. the main one being that i simply hate him and his followers/admirers/sycophants/worshipers. He abuses innocent people. He abuses good-natured, kind people. He lies. He manipulates. He and his greed are a detriment to everything they come in contact with. much like the US shouting murica as they trounce another third world country to eradicate a corrupt regime, such is also my mission.
Let me ask you Dr. Anon redditor, What do you do when you come across a horrible miscarriage of justice? Do you simply write out a list then move on? That approach to life is fucking retarded. When you have a cause that you believe in, do you just simply give up because some jerk-fuck told you just to give up? Your mother is murdered, and there's no killer found, do you just "move on" because there's nothing left to do? 
I'm not a quitter. Im not making myself out to be a fucking martyr either, its a complete fallacy for you to infer that in any way. When snowden learned of the horrors the NSA was involved in, should he have just "moved on?" When one knows truths, truths that are systematically removed to prevent the flow of information, one will not stop until their message is heard by everyone. If you dont like what i have to say, then take your own advice and "move on." I will not ever stop.
Let me ask you this, since you appear to post in the dogecoin and bitcoin subs. What if the mods of were all affiliated with a certain exchange/business, and everything that was brought up that was true about this said business was removed and dismissed as fud? What if the control of free flowing information was squashed because the mods had a vested interest in a certain business and they knew any information that could jeaoprdize that business would be a detriment to their pocketbooks?
What if every single service in bitcoin was offered by one company, and the mods pushed for everyone to use that one company, knowing that, by doing so, it would create more business for them?
How could this place be considered as a hub for information, news and community, when the integrity of it has been removed? How could anyone trust anything that goes on there if the mods are all engaged in collusion with the business that wants to take everyone's money? 
Does this seem ethical or right, just, honest or good business to you at all? How can one sit back and knowingly allow others to be manipulated? (say a new member joins and everyone pushes them into this business because its more money for them, and the new user is none the wiser.)
**The ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY of virtual currency is DECENTRALIZATION**. Most of the services, mods, information and products in dogecoin are being CENTRALIZED.
You may be just fine with laying down and watching people get fucked over so at the end of the day you have a few more dollars, most people are not. I'm not.

@_date: 2014-06-10 16:13:23
classic moolah. i love it. 
straw man after straw man. refute facts with emotional triggers. 
The only lunatic is someone who puts money in your slimy hands.
Also i know the full extent, you told a lie and was asked to provide proof, but you couldnt do it because you had to "protect" your investors by not releasing any information about them in the immediate breath after you announced that a "japanese doctor" was buying up your PIE shares. lol. so many lies, its hard to keep them all straight right?
how many times can i call you out dude? you really, really suck at this. However, you're great at getting people to hand over money to you, stick with that.
when one only responds to facts with name calling, one has immediately lost an arguement. Just because you want me to be some racist, homophobe doesnt make it such. Youve been using that line for some time now.
I guess you having me on "ignore" was another lie right? Caught you in yet another lie buddy.

Bitcoin is wise to shun his kind, let the damage be contained to dogecoin, which im sorry so say this, needs burned to the ground and rebuilt at this point. 
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:05:22
I welcome you to give your best shot, champ. You will not see me backing down over the threat of litigation, sir. You have far more to lose than I. 
For the starters, the ATMs are just the subject at hand here, in this article. They are also the springboard onto which you launched you platforms of other "services." We havent even cracked the surface of your other bullshit cons.
If you cannot handle a little heat from the public, you need to wonder back under that bridge from which you came. Do you think any **respected** businessman threatens critics with lawsuits? Do you see any "CEO's" (that term is used as absolutely loose as possible) having a go at people online?
You have a staunch history of public eruptions, and you have even called me a "piece of shit" before. You make rage posts which are later deleted by yourself once your sycophantic clique realizes that their hopeless leader is having another public temper-tantrum. 
Unless you have **HARD EVIDENCE** of me harrassing anyone via PM, or saying "vile things" to them, i suggest you shut your fucking mouth about that because it's yet again another one of your lies. I urge anyone to receives a "vile" "harassing" PM from me to immediately report it to the administrators here at reddit.
Truth is ive sent no harassing PM's to anyone. I'm free to message whom i want about anything i please. "Alex," I'm also free to speak my mind outside of your sanctuary that is I will continue to persue you and your business until everything you've done is made public. Don't think I'm just going away because you threaten me with lawsuits. Didn't you use the same line somewhere else?? HMMM??
Let's talk about vile. If demanding TRUTH makes me vile, so be it. If calling out a liar makes me VILE then so be it. If demanding honesty and integrity makes me VILE then so be it, "Alex." What is it about me that's so vile? Is it because you know that I'm 100% in the right and all you have left to do is toss out straw men and call me names? Is that it "Alex?"
I love how you try your hardest to silence the dissenting voices by any means possible. Let me assure you, "Alex," that the tide is turning against you. So, you go ahead and sit there feeling smug, like you're king of the hill. While your team of yes-men and shills blow smoke from their e-cigs up your ass, the core of dogecoin is slowly waking up to see what a monster you truly are. Your only revenue stream at this point is dogecoin, and you're about to see it crumble away beneath you.
You/your team fucked with the wrong guy, pal. Also, to quote you, "fuck off."

Here's the kicker folks! Moolah DID stop a company called cryptiv from handling the dogecar fundraising drive, because he didnt want them to use it as a publicity tool. his reply to that is:


Well this is awkward as i have the links for exactly what you said, then a link for you telling everyone youre putting your logo on the nascar page. so which one of your statements are bullshit?
QUOTES FROM YOU MOOLAH






HERE'S YOU PUTTING YOUR LOGO UP!!

You said, in 3 links i provided that youre have ZERO DESIRE FOR SELF-PROMOTION, then you promote yourself on the very thing that you didnt want cryptiv to promote himself on.
**i dont think you realize with self-promotion is.**
it doesnt matter what size your "font/logo" is, its there, [and its not "out of site (sic)."](
 
whats your logo? its just text and two stupid hoops. no one would ever understand wtf the stupid hoops are for so you have to have your LOGO in TEXT. So the text IS your logo.
I just proved you a liar and you have nothing to say about it except throw garbage back at me about font sizes. The only bullshit being thrown around here is from you.

@_date: 2014-05-28 21:44:54


**your definition of "brand new" is unique. Understanding that they are a new service is one thing, but to label them brand new is just wrong. Explain why they would start operation if they weren't fully ready to go? Either they weren't ready to go live and did to get their hands on money or they went live after testing and their platform just sucks.**


**im not sure what you mean there through the litany of typos, but what more proof does one need? look around, the missing deposits, the problems with withdrawals are everywhere. If you want links ill gladly provide them, beginning with this post.**


**Again, if you have any of this information, its strictly hearsay unless you personally have met with moolah. Im not doubting he exists as a human being, i do take umbrage with his "fake identity." The fact that a company is registered proves nothing as his name does not appear on a single document. and why doesn't appear? because using a fake name in a legal document is illegal. please put 2 and 2 together. IF HIS NAME APPEARS ON A SINGLE DOCUMENT PLEASE LINK ME SO I CAN STOP SPREADING THIS 'FUD.'**


**Do you think for a second, that the creator of a virtual currency payment platform and exchange would make a 18 million-coin mistake? If you are to believe this, then you also have to believe that he applies the same scrutiny to his businesses as he does to his donation amounts. I don't buy it for a second, it was planned and contrived. If he is making legit mistakes like that why the fuck would you give him a dime of your money?**


**because anything moolah says you believe hook, line and sinker. what is "playing around on google?" do you even know what happened? Moolah was asked to present documentation to back up his statements and vehemently refused, threatening legal action. When confronted with going public with the situation moolah decided to make a bitchy rant-post like a child told to go sit in the corner.**
**Where was this libel? what were they saying? probably the same things I'm saying, correct? why do you think they were saying this? what was their motive? Do you understand the foundation was in place to protect shibes from this sort of behavior? Do you realize that people left the foundation because of the rotten state of the subreddit which allowed moolah to proliferate all without any sort of regulation or ethics? All anyone wanted was proof from him that he's who he said he is, thats all.**


**What damage was done, can you explain in detail what it was? What site rules were being broken, the one where moolah was asked to provide proof of his financial solvency, the one where he was asked to provide proof of these "audits" he's conducted, or the one where moolah was asked to prove just a single fucking fact to anything he's said to prove that hes worthy of an endorsement from the foundation?Or are you talking about his straw-man, which was people wanted his personal information. the foundation never wanted that, just proof that he was who he said he was (not a public doxxing) and that his claims of audited accounts were valid.**


**i don't like criminals taking advantage of innocent people.**
But the fast that he has so many people who did invest into their company and that we, as investors are pretty happy with it should say something.
**So is that why you chose to disclose that you were an investor? oh that's right you didn't. you purposely provided misleading information to OP to put moolas services in a respectful light, but like anything involving moolah, you simply cant be trusted to fully disclose the truth.**
**If you are so happy being an "investor" can i ask you to provide facts that back up your claims? give me figures, give me something, tangible that i can use to change my opinion. See i don't want to continually have these arguments if they aren't true, but not a single soul can provide a fucking fact to save their life. Moolah says "investors are happy." you say "investors are happy" what does that mean? Do you realize that bernie madoff's investors were extremely happy with the return on their investments? Happy doesn't mean shit in the legal world.**
**Please give me information to change my opinion. Don't give me opinion and hearsay. What did you invest? how did you invest? why are you happy, what is it that he's done that''s so great? I want to know so I dont go around spreading shit that's not true.**
**Do you realize that you're nothing but a shill? you seem like you are a decent person, do you want to be a shill? Stop hiding that you're an investor, stop defending moolah at every opportunity, you come off as a shill for him, which is not a good thing.**
**Again, look at facts, if you have facts to combat any accusation ive made, please i want to see them. i so desperately wanted moolah to be a good thing for dogecoin and crypto in general, but it's not looking that way.**
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:04:04

I've never been over here, not because I dislike bitcoin, or even care about this "rivalry" that exists, but that I wanted to get into mining because im an avid computer geek. I just cant do shit without specialized mining equipment, so scrypt appeals to me. Litecoin seemed to hard to mine compared to watching the dogecoins roll in. for a newcomer this is excitement at its finest. Soon ill be looking for a greater ROI and move on to a more valuable coin once doge stops being the one to mine.
i agree wholeheartedly about the cj in every sub, but its being taken to new heights over there. there is an uncomfortability to it all and a grifting-type atmosphere. I tend to stick to the less popular alt-coin subs as dogecoin just gets me angry after a while.
i actually was banned once from because i exploded on people who were wanting to buy dogecoin on a credit card, and i believe i was right in doing so. I was only looking out for those who didnt know any better, turns out this was the last time i had that mindset.

before the brigade comes in to downvote facts lets toss some around.
1. Moolah took investment money for ATMs and never delivered them. All he's done is continually made excuses as to why they have never been delivered.
2. Moolah's reddit posts have a "weird" commonality of comments. Comments from non-existent accounts, accounts with 1-10 total comments, and comments from accounts that have 1-2 years of inactivity that *spring to life* in praise of moolah.
3. Moolah strong-armed the dogecoin donation drives away from other developers because in his words, "i dont want the donations to be used for publicity," but decided it was in his best interest to put his logo on every donation drive he's controlled. 
4. Moolah makes a 1% profit on his services, and owes investors 25% of his 1%, leaving him with 0.75% profit on an exchange that is virtually stagnant. This means that employees go unpaid, bounties go unpaid, and he's left having to sell T-shirts to turn a profit.
5. He's interloped into every idea the Dogecoin community has had ever since he's stomped on the scene, robbing young devs of their opportunity to get their start. He's trying to become the K-Mart of Dogecoin, focusing on providing services to any and all ideas presented instead of working on securing ATM's and increasing revenue to his flailing exchange.
6. He's not proven any solvency in any of his services other than a self-audit which basically says, "I'm good, nothing to see here." He vehemently is opposed to third-party audits or providing any proof that he's lived up to any of his claims to investors.
I can go on, and on and on....
A quick look on twitter and other subreddits will illustrate that numerous other people are having problems withdrawing money from his exchange. (Remember when Mt Gox stopped withdrawals...then started them back up?) With all of his time spent on reddit and irc its had to believe that he's serious about putting his customers first.
There's a reason he's gone to great lengths to hide his identity, even going so far as to threaten litigation to those who would ask him to prove who he really is. 
Start adding up the equations... He promised ATM's and never delivered. His PIE information is kept from public view, he's offered investment shares in his company in a manner that is illegal according to the SEC, he's tried to start ASIC farms (another complete sham) even though every shred of common sense tells one that hash farming is a scam, hes moved into professional charity fundraising that, according to him, he does at a "loss of profit," and now, to make money, he's begun selling .50 cent t-shirts at $25 a pop to make money. 
Is he a scammer? You do the math.

We have a guy who pops up on the scene with a 2-week old account, then proceeds to dupe people into forking over cash for his ~~scam~~ ATM business. We have people who aren't letting him forget what he promised, how is that any sort of "fuckery?"
By your definition I guess people who want their BTC back from MK are also engaged in "fox-news style fuckery" as well? How is holding people accountable for their actions any sort of smear campaign?
You seem to me like someone who is a moolah supporter and endorses the continued fleecing of the dogecoin community, a community of generous people who only wish to do good. The people of the dogecoin community are generally younger, more apt to see the good in people and ignore or fail to believe that an ongoing system is in place to extort money from them.
If you really have an idea what's going on then i welcome you to debate facts with me, if you're just another jackass who blindly supports the actions of a thief and bully then i pity you.
Stop trying to dismiss facts and evidence with your pathetic straw men/aunt sallys. Also, i give you points for including incendiary names like Glen Beck into the mix just to appeal to the disdain of an obviously liberally biased audience.
How the fuck are truth, honesty, integrity and holding someone accountable bad things?

ya know, i should have wrote down what i thought your response would be, I almost got it word for word. 
Can someone not use an analogy with you without you going brain dead in the middle of it? You embody the typical redditor. Your 7 years here shine through and though with every sardonic word you type.
