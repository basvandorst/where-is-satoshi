No he doesn’t really.
This is just stock price increase divided by time for the last year or something—it could drop just as easily and is only “money” after he sells.
Him picking it up wouldn’t have much effect on his stock prices unless he spent all day doing it—and even if he did, he could have someone organize his meetings with the boards of the companies he ownes stock in so that he only has to spend a short time per day.
He could probably spend most of the day picking up money without having a drastic effect on the stocks he owns—as long as he was organized.

Whether the people truly  own the means of production is more of a philosophical question—because any group of people publicly owning and voting over something is essentially a government—therefore it is very hard to distinguish between a government owning it or the laborers—because the laborers owning it essentially form a “government”, and a government owning it can be formed of laborers.

As you strip people of rights and increase control, you unsurprisingly end up in a situation that’s great for dictators/oppressive leaders—which is what most communist/socialist countries have had.
And once it starts failing from careless policies like in Venezuela, it only cements the need to be like that as the general populace gets angrier.

People shit on the French government, but can they actually do much? They can’t do everything.
The French government is stuck between a rock and a hard place. They really can't offer much more to their citizens. Their budget deficit* is constrained to 3.8% of their GDP (per EU regulation) and their GDP is stagnating. These protesters are asking for a lot, and the government doesn't even have the means to raise substantially more money through taxes.
They tried a 75% marginal income tax on people making over €1 million euros and their revenue DECLINED. The wealth tax (recently repealed by Macron) has caused tens of thousands of millionaires to leave France, and they are already sucking every penny out of middle class French citizens.
I'm not sure there is anything the government can do at this point to please the protesters. There is not much more revenue to derive from French citizens, which is why you are increasingly seeing EU countries turning to Amazon/Facebook/Apple taxes to raise money.
