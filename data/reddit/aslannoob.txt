Maybe bitcoin is a hot air balloon and not an airplane.

I don’t see anything wrong with that. When using a credit card, you borrow money from the bank. Just use a debit card and buy all you want.

In a few weeks “just a reminder that bitcoin is worth -10% than it was a year ago”
Edit: but then you’d start counting from two years ago. Lol.

Assuming that crypto is worthy of comparison to all of those things. Crypto could just be the hot air balloon to the airplane.

Can you? Everyone knows bitcoin uses a lot of power.

Thanks, I couldn’t have gotten my point across without this info.

Wrong. People will start buying when it’s going up again. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:29:46
This isn’t going to increase the price of bitcoin, just decrease the price of alts. And considering the fact that ALL of non top 10 coins are collectively half as big as bitcoin, this won’t really make any big difference in the market.

That’s such a bad question. Simply, 10k is not that much and it’s very easy to earn within 10 years. Of course people will say put it into bitcoin because that’s the high risk high reward option. Imagine if the question said 100m instead? everyone would chose gold because that’s the lowest risk and you actually have 100m afterwards. Question was engineered to get bitcoin as the top answer and all of you are so blind to it.

Lol if you think your bank doesn’t already know everything it needs to know about your funds in Coinbase. You literally buy them through your bank. You confirm your Coinbase account with your bank.

Because it’s not going up? Why would anyone want to buy something that’s going down lol.
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:27:29
Someone’s always gonna find a way to draw a damn line and make it fit lmao

The most I can buy is 2k a week with bank transfer :( what am I doing wrong??

You can divide by 17m bitcoins if you want. That's how many we have now. Numbers will still be similar and will take the same idea across

What is a Gdax account? Is it in Coinbase app?
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:01:04
Top 100 make up over 99% of the market. The numbers will be almost identical using the top 100 or 1000. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:08:21
Not sure man. I've done all of the verifications and identifications and my limit dropped from 2.5k to 2k and hasn't increased. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 01:26:04
Also way more people own gold compared to bitcoin. How much energy would be needed if bitcoin had to have 1b transactions a day?
