Roasbeef is not a group. He is one of the lnd devs. You can find him in their freenode irc channel

They actually pay the miner fees themselves when you withdraw from GDAX so your claim is full of crap.

I don't claim to be an authority that's why I posted here to see what others think. Is really 24! combinations brute forcable?

I don't even own any crypto yet I am still waiting for my first deposit to appear on coinbase.

You are right, that's why I mention cloud storage too

What exactly is the attack vector here? It takes away much of the hassle of physically storing pieces of paper.

That's a P2SH address so are we looking for a private key or a script?
@_date: 2018-05-21 13:02:33
This assumes it is P2SH-P2WPKH and even then which address in the chain are we looking for?

It is not clear how to create the address once you have the seed. Please don’t just reply that i need to enter the seed in a wallet. You cant create a P2SH address from a bip39 seed. You need a SCRIPT

You cant create a P2SH address from a bip39 seed... And the OPs coins are in a P2SH address. You need a script.

I made a [Python library]( that deals with all that, mainly for educational purposes

What are you talking about? Each private key maps to one unique public key. There are no collisions.

I bought an SSD flash drive a few days ago and moved the chainstate directory there (not the blocks directory so a few GB will be enough). I synced the whole chain from scratch in less than 12 hours. Guide on how to do that [here](

There is a 90%+ chance he pulled it out of his ass.
