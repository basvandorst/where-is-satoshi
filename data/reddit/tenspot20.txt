Kinda now makes me wonder if there are any legitimate ponzi schemes.

This is great news for those who normally keep their money in an Allah-ak-jar.

Sold, to the man in the captain's hat for the fair and reasonable price of 1001 Bitties.  Great idea.

Well is there an acronym for the temptation to sell coin when it's value is rising? How about YDSTS = Yo, Don't Sell That Shit

Every time I buy a little coin it jumps up $40+ within the following 24-36 hours. Pretty sure that I am either subconsciously psychic, or that my little $100 micro-investments are having a direct and noticeable effect on overall Bitcoin value.

Can you make one for $5000? "Oh Yeah!"

Will do, I'd also like to add that Bitcoin has been a fun and exciting experience thus far, to add context to OP's question.

Dude, grab a fork and twiddle around inside the toaster to see if there is a small wallet or pass key down there, but plug it in so you can have some light.

I wouldn't use CNN as toilet paper.
@_date: 2019-08-03 17:15:51
It wouldn't, even if it were.

You're going to pay a hell of a lot more than 7 bucks for a good Cuban.

I see it as staying around 10k for a month, then a shallow dip right before a 4k to 6k upslide over the next 4 months. It's gonna be a good Christmas!

I also started with $100 holdings, that has grown to more than $20,000 in a very short time, yes, it's very possible.

I'm on a diet when it comes to spending Bitcoin.

Keep those corrupt Democrats off my fucking Crypto! Everything these commies touch turns to shit!
@_date: 2018-02-20 05:04:38
Homey got that mad coin!

doth looks like cloth that was in a front end collision, it's a good thing that "click" is a excellent driver.

Yes, thank you, I was just making the comment to illustrate the rapid increase in Bitcoin value today.

5K is my softbank limit, anymore than that goes in the hardsafe.
Coinbase bank is a "Softy Deposit Box".
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:33:35
Can someone send me a text when it gets to 10K? I'm gonna run to the store.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:29:11
What is this "sell" thing that he speaks of? Does he mean buy?

No Trust, Time Magazine hates American progression. See @_date: 2019-05-05 16:44:59
Might want to consult with John Mcafee before enacting that proclamation.
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:36:15
Bitcoin value is surging because of his comments.
