Most people don't have much to invest at once. Buying small amount is the only way for some people.

Then you didn't really have money to invest. Only invest what you are afforded to lose.

Do you have any sources for that. I can't really see any indicators.

Ohh tell me more prophet.

No real reasons at all?

You shouldn't make prediction with the ongoing trend(especially if the trend is parabolic). It's not going to last for ever.
Same thing has happened many times before.
If you took 4 week trend from 23 NOV 2017 - 14 DEC 2017, It would have pointed that BTC value increases 100% every month but obviously it was never going to happen.

You should read some basic  economic principles. 


It would be nice if we could live in big commune and take care of each other but sadly humans psyche doesn't work that way.

These selloff aren't done buy weak hand, but by institutional investors.
You can't reverse this correction by  telling everyone to buy ''30$''.
If you belive in the technology there shouldn't be anything to fear.

Quantum computing has a potential to break SHA-256 but at that point BTC will be one of the smallest things to worry. Crypto can always fork into quantum resistant algo. I would be more worried about old monetary system and their private data that is encrypted.

Qubits are like transistors but for quantum computers and instead having 2 states(0 and 1) those have 4 states.
\&gt; What does doubly exponential growth look like? The classic exponential growth function when dealing with bits is obviously doubling, a function defined as **2\^n** in binary systems. How do you double doubling? Simply replace the **n** in the doubling function with another doubling function, or **2\^2n**.
