What are the best alternatives?

Not everyone should run a full node. Ensure you have a really good Internet connection.

That is, Liters, not `long size = 4L;` :)

Does that mean that theoretically difficulty can go down if people get unlucky and mine slower?

What do larger blocks mean for Bitcoin?

Will fees ever go down to reasonable levels?

What is NYA/S2X? ELI5?

 in the sidebar recommends Coinbase

What other kinds of fixes are there aside from increasing block size? More users means more transactions, no? How can Bitcoin function as a currency without transactions?

I can't even start using it, as you can see.

I don't want PayPal to accept Bitcoin, I want someone to compete with PayPal.

Where do you recommend we exchange instead?
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:34:33
I've registered for the first two, on hold for both. And I don't trust LocalBitcoins and buying from random people.

What is skrill? Haven't been on this subreddit in months.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:41:37
So what should we use instead?
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:37:38
I'm 20, 1.5k can pay over two months of living expenses. It's not peanuts at all.

An arbitrary person in their 20s is unlikely to have 10 years of work experience. If you assume the "best case scenario", 29 year olds, then they would start working at 19, or worked earlier and took a break, which would be a stretch if they go to college. For the "worst case scenario", 20, you're assuming they started working when they were 10 years old.
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:18:17
Do you think it'll go up again?
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:08:22
It's too high of a rate, it should be closer to 0.

Expected to exist in 2015 by people living in 1985.

More like it's gonna happen within a century.

No lol. It can't handle the transaction volume, at all.

I hate those ads...

Damn, I really shouldn't have waited to make an investment in Bitcoin.

Well, AMD cards are considerably better than Nvidia as far as hashrate. I only get 2 Mhs

Yes, but you are still using BTC as a base unit for the mBTC &amp; uBTC. It's like using 0.1 of a cent (If you're using US currency) for transactions. It just doesn't make sense to me to have the base unit have such a high value. 
If you tell a random person who has only just heard of bitcoin and doesn't yet understand the values that you'll give him one bitcoin for something, at first they'd probably think that you'd be ripping them off by a whole lot. 
If we're gonna use mBTC and uBTC as the standard for transactions, we should *at least* change the default setting for viewing bitcoin amounts to mBTC.
@_date: 2013-08-01 01:53:48
If we changed the default Bitcoin viewing amount to mBTC, renamed it to BTC, rename the old BTC to kBTC (kiloBTC) and rename uBTC to mBTC, that would fix my issue without having to majorly change something in the network.
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:14:21
Infinitely? I thought it only went to something really small like 0.01 uBTC?

It seems as if peer coins are generated per stakeholders, meaning that people with 1% of the peercoins in existence will generate 1% of the money.
Litecoins generate money evenly throughout the network, designed for anyone to be able to generate them.
And, as you probably know, Bitcoins generate by how powerful your hardware specs are.
