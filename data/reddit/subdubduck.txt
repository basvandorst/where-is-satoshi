Additionally to the general psychological aspect 11,800$ is significant because it currently happens to correspond to the 10,000€ barrier which is very psychologically significant. There is a fat ~160btc sell wall at 10,000€ that has held up all day and that the price won't move beyond.
I'm somewhat surprised actually. I figured the larger volume in the dollar market might fuel the push to 12,000$, breaking the 10,000€ psych barrier in the process.

Possible influence, but not substantial enough to justify what's happening I think:

Yeah, but that's because you can put people in it who pay you rent, no? If you own 49% of a house but have no control over who lives there I feel like you effectively do not own any part of the house ...
e: What I'm trying to say is, from my understanding, the sole purpose of the financial instrument these guys created is to allow people to speculate on housing prices. I guess I'm just not clear on what is meant legally by "selling" 49% of your house.

I'm still wondering how that is supposed to work. Do you still own the right to live in the entirety of the house? If yes, then you are only selling ownership of the property itself, but why would anyone buy a percentage of a house that they then have no control over and can't live in. What's the use of 49% percent of a house you can't do anything with? It certainly doesn't pay dividends.
