Andy got me into reddit a few years ago. He talked to me a lot about bitcoins and yes he told me all about the hat eating thing. Those of us that knew him weren't too surprised.

I'm the person who originally posted that Andy died. I know it's difficult to know when reading something online if it's actually true, but in this case I'm sorry to say that it is. I posted his gofundme page as a way to prove that it was actually him, but there's really not much more I can do. 
It is true that Andy died of a heroin overdose, however, the link that was posted with the photos and story of the man in the hospital bed is not Andy. I'm not sure why someone decided to make that and pass it off as him. I have seen that story before. It's been around for a while now.
Andy was my best friend. He was one of the only genuinely good, kind people I've ever met. His death has been very difficult for those of us that were lucky enough to know him. He struggled with depression and addiction, and his overdose was the result of getting clean for a few months and then doing it again one night. 
His mom said that in the weeks leading up to his death he told her that if anything were to happen to him that he wanted her to let his reddit friends know. She couldn't find his phone after he passed away, so she asked me if I knew how to reach them. Posting on here was the only thing I could think to do. 
I wanted to add, that he also occasionally posted from a different account - totes_meta_butts. I'm not sure if anyone would have known him from that name, but I thought I'd throw it out there just in case.
