I'm on average around $550.
I have a sell plan that takes advantage of a bubble and includes buying back after the crash. 
If there are 2 or 3 more bubbles of the same magnitude of the last ones, I think I might be able to buy a nice little island.

Yeah we're just generally a shitty species when it comes to murdering each other, and it's nothing new.  But what's new is that we're so much better at murder than we ever were before.
I did some fancy excel tabulation with this data: 
I took the lower estimate for death tolls of all wars, and calculated the number of people killed per year.
For all wars from 1-1900 this data says 68.9k people were killed per year in wars.
In the wars from 1900-present this data says 320.4k people were killed per year in wars.  And I even intentionally left out WWI and WWII as I figured they could be considered statistical outliers (I know nothing about statistics).  If you leave those in and the numbers killed per year in the last hundred years are even higher.
So unless I've made egregious errors (it's very likely), or if this list is dramatically incomplete (it even says it is) it looks like the mechanization of war is damn horrible.

Actually it has tripled in price since October last year. 
I'm not saying you're wrong, it is a shit show.

Yup. No amount of fiat inflation, or additional bank fees would have cost me $50. 
But then I wouldn't have magic Internet money in my pocket. Money that I didn't use, because there's nowhere to spend it yet.

Lol you're the one asking pedantic questions and it isn't fair to ask you a relevant one? 
Troll.

Please rephrase the question. Even my 4 year old doesn't just say "Why?"

You really need someone to tell you to get your coins off a shaky exchange? 
I'd withdraw and wait out the storm. You can always transfer them back when you decide they're still trustworthy.
