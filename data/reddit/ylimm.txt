hyperinflation will never occur on this level due to there being a limited amount of bitcoin - no one can suddenly increase the amount of bitcoin available to cause the value of bitcoin to drop to 3.4 hundred-thousandths of what it is worth a year ago if it is used as currency

it's a gt3 rs lol

for example, my school had pre-calc taught sophomore year, then i chose to take IB Maths junior year, then AP Calc and AP Stats senior year
however there are still schools that don't have IB diploma program or AP curriculums

who has a firm belief in the taxi driver lifestyle? or the philosophy of taxis?
who goes into banking for a deep belief of inflation and that governments should bail banks out? 
no, those professions are dictated by a need for money
