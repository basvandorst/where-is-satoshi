Anything that reminds me of a G8 protest is an immediate turn off. 
Also, this is about as productive as using a guy in a Guy Fawkes mask. Not the message we want to send.

Not necessarily. They can be public, or just released to shareholders or key business partners. But even if they're public, that doesn't mean the government has to be the one doing it and requiring it.

He's talking about a supply of services companies, of competition. Whether paypal charges 2% or 5% doesn't mean that suddenly there are no other payment processors or banking services companies.

I was just messing around. But you got me thinking: would communists be interested in bitcoin? With bitcoin, how can the state ensure redistribution of wealth? That'd run anathema to how it operates. 
Just throwing out a thought.

It also slows down the Hewlitts, Packards, Dells, Jobs, and other garage tinkerers who grew into creating greatness for the world. I'd rather the market (free people) decide if they don't like some upstart. Those that are risk averse can wait until a startup gains legitimacy. 
Regulation from the state isn't the only way to go about this.

Careful, that's An-Cap thinking right there!

This right here. England is ahead by about a couple of decades compared to the US, but we're right behind them.

If consumers demand 3rd party audits they can trust, companies will comply. But people have to be educated to demand it. That's why for example before the MtGox fiasco I was warning people not to touch those guys with a 10 foot pole. No transparency or independent information. MtGox being hacked was a good thing in that it'll wake people up to asking for more from these organizations in the future.

Because not everyone lives in a city like San Francisco, Houston, or Boston. 
Hopefully, as the tech evolves in these tech hubs, it'll spread to the poorer countries with less expertise.

Given his accomplishments and what he spoke about at that event, I'm really disappointed that he would make such a dumbed down and refutable criticism of a currency.

Not according to Steve Gibson, Bruce Schneier, and many other security experts whose opinion I'll take over yours. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:11:23


That's a broad and debatable statement. MtGox was a classic hack. These regulations don't magically make IT systems impenetrable. It's really up to an individual organization to determine how to best protect itself and how much protection they're willing to have.

A loose analogy would be if back in the VERY early days of the web, people had to register with the state just to have a website, and require documentation from each site visitor. What would something like that have done to the web?

You, sir, should work for the Fed. They love that kind of math.

It'd be nice if it was built into the protocol. 
This is why escrow services exist, and we'll see these 3rd parties even for BTC transactions.

Unfortunately that pushes innovation underground instead of allowing people to do so publicly. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:58:37


This is like all the crazy anti-gun regulations. Organizations like MAIG keep using that loaded phrase "common sense", then the detail of the law does stuff like ban "that shoulder thing that goes up" on guns.

Well, the fundamentalists think evolution is "Just a theory". So's gravity. Why not push them out a window.

Enterprise developer over here. Depends on the system. But every system needs maintenance over it's lifetime. Sometimes your company switches from Oracle to SQL Server and you have to re-write the data access layer, even if the software is working just fine otherwise. Stuff happens and you have to have IT on hand. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:12:11


He was asking if that organization were to have been operating under these proposed regs, how it would've prevented the loss. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:20:17


My problem with that comes down to social contract theory and the fact that it's involuntary. So it comes down to your political viewpoint. Me? I try to maximize voluntary interactions. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:56:51
This is how (non government) regulation should work. People who want it can demand ISO or UL certification. Others can choose to forgo it. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:49:59
Agreed. But the logic is that once the business can pay its expenses in Bitcoin, then the need for the middleman to do a BTC/USD conversion goes away.
Still doesn't mean there's no need for middlemen. Someone in the middle may be helpful for things like payment disputes.
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:51:10
Bingo! And this is the difference between government regulation and market regulations. Let the users decide of that startup is safe enough or not.

A moron with an audience and influence. 
This should help BTC adoption so long as BTC doesn't get lumped in with his views.

How can I contribute server resources to this project? I can do hosting, bandwidth, processing power, whatever the software needs, I can provide. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 01:03:37
Very well written. While I don't agree with everything you wrote, it's a great explanation and I'm glad to see similar viewpoints on this sub in support of Bitcoin. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:35:37
The devil's in the details. I don't want the government dictating for example the specific security criteria. They generally do a poor job of it.

If you're outside NY, but have a customer in NY, couldn't NY State file charges against you and then use something akin to extradition to get a warrant out for you in your home state?

I can blow through that in a single purchase if I'm buying dev tools (SQL Server, Visual studio, etc). Not sure if this applies to grown up software though.

They've always been really profitable. You have to give them that. They just haven't innovated in such a long time. They missed the app/mobile/os train so many times. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 17:28:03
Yes, I saw the video and read the regs. They provide yet another bit of government oversite. We had plenty of financial regulations and yet someone like Berni Madoff still slipped through. Talk to a CPA about SOX and they'll tell you it's a jobs program to keep auditors, analysts, and CPAs employed. 
It comes down to approach. These regs require government security audits. I'd rather those audits be handled by a private 3rd party for those companies and their customers who request them. The problem with government regulation is that you can't opt out and go with a different system. I'd rather that we the community determine that system voluntarily than for it to be handed down by force.

So to sum it up, something happened, and instead of contacting the company to rectify it, you wrote this angry post and started looking into alternatives?

You can donate a smaller amount. There's an "Other" option. I donated $1 in BTC and made up junk for the information to submit about my name and address. It went through.
