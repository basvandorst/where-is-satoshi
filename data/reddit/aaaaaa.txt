Mining is not decentralized any more. 
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:51:19
If most blocks had 0 transactions in them because it was more profitable to do that, wouldn't the market eventually just start attaching higher fees to their transactions until they had a good probability of high enough value to be included in a block, thus making it less profitable to SPV mine than to include the transactions?
Or do you literally mean never ever? How can that be the case? surely if I attached a 25bitcoin fee to a transaction it would be worth including it?

No. You can't. You cannot send information this way...
This isn't an entirely accurate analogy but think of it like this in terms of the information being communicated. You have 1 red piece of paper and 1 blue piece of paper, you put each piece of paper in to a separate bag. You take one bag and travel to the other side of the planet , you look inside to see what colour paper you have. You see that it is blue, you instantly know that the other bag has a red piece of paper in...
Let's say you do the above experiment with 100 pieces of paper, so that if anyone knows the colour of one piece of paper they instantly know the colour of another. You travel to a far  away land and discover a new species, you can't tell anyone about it using the paper method, although you could have potentially setup the initial configuration to leave a message, but you may as well have used a post it note.
You can't use this to transmit information.

This was a shit post and all of your reasons were completely retarded .
legitimate reasons to be concerned over cryptocurrency:
1. quantum computing breaking sha-256 hashing and not available to consumers to implement quantum crypto, no replacement comes in time and the currency dies.
1.5 a vulnerability in sha-256 or ecdsa is discovered weakening it's effective strength 
2. unknown software bug, see 2010 bitcoin bug that enabled someone to create a transaction with an output larger than it's input, to the tune of billions of bitcoin
3. centralization of mining to the point where state regulation can easily manipulate the truth of the blockchain, effectively handing control of the currency back into the hands of the state. 
4. the universe is a computer simulation and the intelligent beings responsible for running it notice a lot of wasteful computation occurring in our sector of the simulation and decide to erase it.

Please, take your fetish for equality somewhere else. You're not defined by a gender, don't make the fact that you didn't feel comfortable in a tech community revolve around gender. 
Women aren't equally represented in the tech community because they simply aren't as interested... we didn't have to wrestle away the patriarchy in order to get women involved in arts and crafts, simply because there's a larger number of women that are interested in those things. Whatever, go ahead and try, just don't beat yourself up over failing miserably.

potentially stupid question as I have not been paying as much detail to the transaction/spv thing as I would like to. Why not just prioritize the transactions with the highest fees, wouldn't that "solve" the problem? 
Aside from the monoculture point you made, what are the potential advantages of an algorithm that's not prioritizing based on fees ?

Governments have a hard time controlling software, they're much better at controlling physical space. The geographic centralization of mining, with large warehouses full of ASICS play right into that.

Precisely why giving the enemy, the people who regulate things, the state, more information about bitcoin and cooperating with them in general is a bad idea. 


We don't need to send any kind of message. Bitcoin functions on its own. 


Depending on your definition of fall I doubt that, short of the state physically confiscating every piece of hardware with bitcoin software, bitcoin will continue to function. I think state regulation will come sooner with cooperation with politicians, preferably it would come later.

Cooperating with the state.
Giving them useful information when you aren't forced to?
It amazes me the bitcoin community isn't unequivocally against this, bitcoins ability to get around the draconian rules states enforce is the entire reason it has potential... why help the enemy? Because doing so helps bitcoin appear more "legitimate" in your eyes? The currency stands on it's own, it doesn't need state regulation.
Not that I think the states attempts to regulate it will be successful, never the less I give my sincere "fuck you guys" to everyone attending.

I disagree that this is the best way to evaluate a position, why exclude important information when considering an idea, i.e. the source of that information. That doesn't mean the idea becomes automatically wrong if it's coming from someone who is frequently wrong, but it does mean it's more likely to be wrong and stronger evidence/argumentation is needed to provide confidence in the correctness of it.
