"It follows Satoshis original vision of Bitcoin." 
That's getting old. Not only is it a lie, it's also a very bad lie. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:24:31
It's easy to manipulate people when they willingly flock to you. Just keep them hateful with lies about censorship and "the original vision of Satoshi's bitcoin" and you'll get rich.

No worries Mr Bloomberg, we liquidized your assets and America is ready for your purchase.

He's planning on buying coins at a volume/price that he expects prices to change for the rest of us. That's ludicrous unless he is a very early adopter or incredibly wealthy. I'm making fun of that.

No it isn't. 0-1 is infinite increase. Exponential increase is from 2-4 or 4-16 etc.

The ONE great thing about Bitcoin, is that you can act as your own bank. Be ashamed, be very ashamed.

They're happening because they can. Go download the source code, change something and 'create' your own Bitcoin Diamond... or whatever. It's an open source project.

ITT: Fools who ignored our warnings and left their coins on an online wallet against our suggestions. Fools never change.
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:25:41
So you seem quite well educated in Bitcoin-terms, but you still leave your coins on an exchange? 
Don't - be - stupid!!!!!!!
MILLIONS of coins were stolen, because companies employ humans. Having your own wallet requires ZERO trust in third-parties.
Pull your head out lf your ass and buy a hardware wallet, for fucks sake.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:14:32
Yes and free ice cream growing on every tree.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:01:04
You should never fuckin ever have a major fraction of coins on an exchange. You're doing something wrong if that's the case.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:07:32
Not that we care what you say, but why do you keep asking in this passive aggressive fashion?

You could try and use that newfangled invention: Google
And then.. you know... cross-reference it yourself?

BIP39 and 44, actually.

He's not a fellow Bitcoiner if he doesn't understand Bitcoin. Willful ignorance should not be encouraged.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:43:32
Youd think that after 8 years, people would slowly start to understand that cryptocoins are stored on the respective blockchain. Nowhere else.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:29:33
You mean the password to unlock the .dat wallet file? Uhm, that should never change.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:55:51
No, don't use Google when someone gives you a helpful answer. Don't do it!
You better wait until someone comes along and tells you what a Ledger nano s is. It's the only way.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:56:15
Knowledge is a journey. In any case, there are two different kinds of wallets. Full and light wallets. Light wallets have the benefit of not needing to dowload the full blockchain (100+ GB) as they connect to trusted nodes. Also, always use open-source wallets and NEVER closed-source or online wallets unless you use it short-term for trading.
I suggest [Electrum]( If you want to be even more safe, then buy a hardware wallet such as [Trezor]( or [Ledger Nano S](
(This is applicable to all cryptocurrencies).

The public key is the address that coins are addressed at (the Send-To address). There are addresses with many hundreds and thousands of coins on a single address.
Finding the private key corresponding to the public key gives you control. No transaction necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-24 09:46:46
You clearly lack even basic understanding of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. You do realize that coins are stored on the blockchain and not in any wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:26:39
There's no need to use the same receiving address, but ok. As long as he doesn't change seeds.
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:03:54


no, just no
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:54:55
Nah. Literally 99% of all countries use the metric system and are therefore used to these unit prefixes. Besides, people ignore them all the time and still understand each other. 
Take calories for example. No one ever talks about kilo-calories and yet it's the proper unit of measure. 
Unless people really count their 2.000.000 calories a day.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:29:07
Yup yup. I was just being a smarty pants about the BIP44 bit. 
I personally don't understand why the Electrum devs chose their own key derivation method. Isn't a full 24-word seed the equivalent of a 512-bit number? 
That's a hell of a lot more bits, and therefore entropy, as compared to the 8-word electrum seed.
Edit: Or was it 10 words for an Electrum seed?
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:19:08
You sure? I was under the impression that the address space was on the order of 10^60 unique addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:40:37
Your level of ignorance is mind-blowing. With crypto you can ACTUALLY hold your money instead of "the man". So what's your answer?.... "hurr durr I don't have money either. The man has it. So why would I own private keys?"
Wow. Just wow.
I repeat: You don't own Bitcoin, never have and yours will eventually belong to millions of others lost coins if you don't control the keys. What you own, good Sir, is a non-legally binding promise that some corporation holds the keys for you. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:43:08
Use Google like an adult, maybe?
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:57:14
There's no difference. Whether you trust it to generate or store your private keys is entirely the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:36:39
He doesn't even have any Bitcoins. They're on online wallets, that ignorant fool. He doesn't even have private keyes.
