I am in it because Keynsian money printing causes poverty, social and environmental damage through misallocation of the very jobs people do for their lives, encouraging constant consumption of useless goods that fail after 12months and asset bubbles that favour the wealthy over those who actually work.

Consider the security bar needed vs the potential benefit from attacking either an individual or an exchange's coins.
An exchange may have 1000s of coins in a hot wallet at any given time, given the turnover of coins and deposits/withdrawals. This means the payout to a potential hacker if far higher than if an individual is hacked.
This can work the other way - spam and botnet type attacks might attack millions of individual home networks or computers at a time - but in general the amount you might hold is not worth it for a targetted attack, especially if you hold coins offline in air gapped wallets or paper wallets.

I think jorschs is correct. Not every users of BTC will transact on chain. If the vision of ubiquitous low fee inflationless decentralised currency for the masses is to be reached it needs to include those whose monthly income is measured in 2-3 figures of USD, not just those who net 1000s or more.
Those users can onboard via direct receipts on a LN channel. 
Even in developed countries new users who want to buy $100 usd or so would be best receiving that directly on LN via an exchange. 
Alternatively they could get started with lower value alt coins, such as Litecoin, using those for cold storage then opening up channels via atomic swaps to reach the BTC LN network.

How does this affect the security model if the channel that you receive your bitcoin through is opened by a bank/exchange/payroll company/ebay etc?
Does there need to be a third party 'witness' system to rebroadcast your transactions should the bank/exchange/payroll/ebay lose control of the channel?

Andreas I'm not sure what your profile was like before Letstalkbitcoin but it has been a pleasure to hear your thoughts evolve over the past year of the podcast.   
One of your early rants about bankers sucking at global money flows compelled me to tip LTB (Adam's 'value for value ideas obviously resonated).   
Personally the narrative you are continually developing is extremely influential as we all grapple with explaining bitcoin 1.0 to others whilst at the same time understanding bitcoin 2.0, bitcoin 3.0 etc.  
Obviously there are many others who in the future will expand and develop this narrative, but for now, today, in this crazy topsy turvy world, you are articulating not only the rage but most importantly the hope that there are other ways to build our world, and that there are others across the world with the same vision.   
I turned away from politics and economics at the age of 18, realising that the system my peers were entering was crooked, yet the alternatives espoused by fringe groups were unworkable and naive.   
18 years later the ability of human ingenuity and creativity to solve these problems has invigorated my thoughts and hopes.  
Keep up the good work, stay close to your friends and good luck on this bitcoin roller-coaster ride!

I'm picturing Satoshi in some mountain retreat, perhaps a temple, that he went to shortly after disappearing, completely oblivious to the bitcoin price, but perhaps better at meditating and hand to hand combat.
Hmmm... is Satoshi actually Batman?

NHS in the uk is a false religion. OECD figures show you are more likely to die from various illnesses than similarly wealthy European neighbours. Drs mostly hate it.

As above the bet, if hedged, is $8.5m vs the cost of 4k bitcoins today at $25m. 
That's a maximum loss also if BTC is at exactly $280k at the settlement date. If it goes higher the difference goes back to the seller. If bitcoin is below $280k but has risen above its current price the seller is up the profit on 4K bitcoins and $8.5m.
I think ensuring the bet is paid is more of a risk than the bet itself - does the proposer have $8.5m is assets to escrow for 5 years?

How are timelocked transactions progressing. Could you have, for example, a 1/2 multisig cold storage address where 1 key can spend at any time but another key can only spend after a certain block?

'So in this case the AmericanCo would never even be able to accept coins from the ChinaCo because the address they sent from would be unregistered.'
But the transaction would still propagate throughout the network. Addresses cannot choose whether they 'accept' a transaction - it happen whether they like it or not. See all the microtransactions sent to the silk road FBI haul address. 
Exactly why I wrote the analogy above. 
The outcomes in the US could be:
1. system fails and breaks down
2. system is enforced leading to parallel coins in the blockchain being worth more (as per Amanojack)
3. full blockchain fork US vs non US
