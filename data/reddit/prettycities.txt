Wouldn't this only be the case if we saw a resulting flow of money into BTC from the UK?

Every time I have been to  it seems the coins have centered around China. If you look at the chart of the yuan today,  you won't see a change in price that matches up with the change in BTC over the past hour.
China's economic situation certainly could drive more money into BTC, but I'm inclined to side with others who say that this recent movement is just some whale manipulating the market.

Sorry about that. Here's an excerpt from the original email along with the google translation:

South Korea, the entire country, has a grand total of **3** bitcoin listings on localbitcoins.com.
Yesterday, Korbit, which is so far as I know the most popular Korean bitcoin exchange website, had volume of about 1,900 BTC. **That was 1.9% of total transaction volume across the world.**
It is not popular here.

This doesn't change the fact that bitcoins traded on Korean markets account for a small fraction of transactions world wide.

This seems right to me. Would have been more secure if they instituted a scratch off system.

I'm currently living in South Korea. I signed up for a Bitcoin service over here, and they sent me an email today.
Essentially, they will be distributing these cards to convenience stores. Spend $50, buy a card, and then use the application to deposit the funds into your account.
Lest you leave this thread thinking Bitcoin is huge in South Korea, here are the two caveats. 
* I have yet to see these. Anywhere.
* Bitcoin adoption seems to be much lower here than in the US or China. I haven't heard mention of it once.
Edit: Someone pointed out that there is no mention of 7-11 in the video. Here is an excerpt from an email the company sent out, along with a Google translation.

Ironically, it means "to not exist."
So, basically, "Oh no!"
