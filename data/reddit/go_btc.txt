The article is not sexist. Raping a girl is. Of course, it could possibly have been a woman to make a statement similar to the one RVer did, as it could have been that a woman raped a child, male or female btw. Sexism is not in the possibilities but in what actually happened.

After one week, a legitimate question we should all be doing is: Is it reaching stability, stillness, staleness or just getting prepared for the next roller-coaster move? :))

The point about holding is that BTC will eventually spread so much that it would work in parallel with cash, so you will not need to cash out.
A second assumption is that cash system will collapse and holders of BTC will own something very valuable and will be wealthy or at least not exposed to a generalized precarity of work and life conditions in a world going on automatized jobs and off natural resources.

Stability finally achieved this week!:)

Don't forget to publish your findings here!

It just supports the hypothesis that BTC is nothing else than the basis for the right-wing political shift in the world. Could it be done without its own economics which makes it possible to overthrow weaker governments?

If that's your plan buy orders still 10200€ on livecoin.

I think I forgot a last S, for stuckness... just to figure out what a 4S could mean for BTC.

How do you make charts? and in, let's say a year, how much have they helped you to achieve success in your investments?
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:48:43
Valuable information. Scarcity increased by 7-15%...It's a lot!!!

Is it owned by someone else than Satoshi?

What's the point of a chart made upon price determined by heavy selling from scammers?

Nice to know that Tails is including Electrum again. I think this is pretty secure as long as you keep your seeds and remember that a usb key sometimes just 'dies'. I saw it happening at least two times and in both cases Tails was being used for many hours a day. You just use a passphrase to access your wallet + the ones for the persistent volume. Probably a better solution  than buying a Trezor.
Check this video from CCC last year. Absolutely hilarious:

Try to find someone to trade in person. Places like btc meetups might help you. 
Check localbitcoin. Even if they stopped to offer the option to buy in cash, you should be able to find someone who wants to sell without a fee. If you do, 1% goes to localbitcoins. 
Search before giving your money away. You already started by posting here. You show you're smart and Coinbase is not for the smart ones. Luck!

He/she could meet several people or pay a lower fee. Pay 900USD to buy one BTC, that's really the smartest thing a person can do.

Bitcoin ownership might play a role in consuming, as it is deflationary. On the other hand, as adoption increases and there are big concentrations of btc on some hands, those who have more btc will by no means be refrained from being pound-foolish.

This is a no go. Utterly disrespectful to both  and  Surely the kind of thing most men would not support in this space.  success is due to her brilliance and competence,  can largely benefit from lightning for his business.
Roger Ver is a shame and this kind of thinking doesn't belong in crypto space.  will prevail while  is already sinking.
This is really the moment for all of us, men and women, stand against his try to lower  in order to justify his own frustration.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:07:45
1...2...I bet that this is all and RVer had no other such 'spicy thoughts' or 'jokes' when he was himself making business with women or in crypto social events.

Trying to work with your terms: rape culture involves both sexism and rape. Notice that I was commenting on a comment which was using the term 'sexism' and I posted about Cody Wilson's plead because I think it belongs in a topic about sexism in the BTC community. Rape is also a type of violence, in this case it would be related to a woman, so, related to sexism (though, of course, in other cases it can be against any person).
Notice: Cody pleaded guilty on injury to a child. The initial felony of statutory rape seems not to be on the table anymore. He thought the girl was at least 18 yo, because of the age required to sign up sugardaddy.

Now that the've got into BTC it's going to grow in the years to come. How visionary they became!
Anyways, thank you GS, without you the world would never have guessed. 
You go to your bank and if it's GS your account manager will just advice you to go invest in BTC. 
are banks preparing their customers for the years to come, or are bankers preparing themselves for the years to come?

Difficult question. By the other side, is it possible to estimate how many btc are in circulation and who owns those out of circulation? Maybe you could get a very raw estimation of the permanently lost ones.

charts chartering resistance level while scammers are opening their bags = Market will get bullish if we reach 10k. Really?  maybe buyers should only put their buy orders at $1.

The US or Trump...named just like the others. Like the others, he embodies the personal character of a dictator governing only for his own small elite.
US should show where the BTC confiscated from Ross Ulbricht.

Who understands about long term contracts?
I read this article:[
But, how to know about when there are future contracts near to be liquidated?
Also, can we think that prices recover shortly after such huge liquidations are over?
Crypto market manipulation is not regulated like overall financial market, is it?
Thank you

For valuable economic analysis and opinion.
Some documentaries from the first years of BTC and those more recent are very formative. But I let this open to suggestions!
