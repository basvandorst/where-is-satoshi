They need to get more BTC out of cold storage I would imagine.  They typically only keep 2% in their hot wallet per insurance requirements.

You asked:


You didn't ask if it was FDIC insurable, you asked if it was insurable at all.  That's answered in the link.

You're not wrong, but if you do it right you can protect it better than cash in a bank account.  It's just takes a lot of work to figure out the best way to make it not worth the risk.  You have to really learn what you're doing and that takes time.

Same deal with TigerDirect if anyone's wondering.

Transparency sounds great. But can you state any specific ongoing moderating problems? Because there's never been any mention of them before, but today there's suddenly a ton of posts about it in an extremely short period of time. Yet I haven't ever seen any evidence of it despite having been subscribed here for years. It's all a bit suspicious, don't you think? 
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:27:15
After reading through the accusations and seeing no real evidence, I'm pretty sure it really is just a shit slinging campaign. It's most likely coming from one of the failing alt-coins. I've noticed they occasionally troll and vote brigade here because it's one of the things that makes their community "fun".
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:43:14
OP bought last week.
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:31:06
No because there hasn't been any clear evidence of censorship. Just a ton of accusations out of nowhere. We'll see if anything turns up over the next couple days, but at this point I doubt it will. This whole controversy out of nowhere seems  manufactured to me. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:55:50
Hey, can you explain what these three posts are about @_date: 2014-04-21 14:01:42
You've been asked multiple times to give specific evidence and yet you are unable to do so.  Speaking of suspicious, do you know anything about catwelder trying to drive this censorship controversy?  He's got two submissions under different usernames trying to drive users to his own bitcoin subreddits, citing "recent censorship".  He also set up a fake Moronic Monday post for the same reason.
This is what actual evidence looks like by the way.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:06:16
Shouldn't we post one for the trolls while is going up again? 
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:16:15
As far as I can tell everyone here is for transparency, even the mods.  Not sure why you keep acting like anyone's against it.  I was just asking for evidence for your claims which so far you have been unable to provide.  Don't you think it's wise to ask for evidence when people are throwing accusations around?
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:01:18
Yeah, it just seems like the usual vote brigaders trying to use the censorship controversy over at r/technology to stir up shit on this subreddit. It'll probably go away when spring break is over. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 22:14:03
Whether it's a UFC fighter, hackathon, or feeding the homeless, as soon as it's posted here all the haters will show up and call it a circlejerk anyway. Might as well have it be something that helps make the world a better place. 
Why isn't all the doge "celebrating"considered a circlejerk I wonder. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:49:31
No, is participating in a coordinated attack against to get people to sign up for his bitcoin subreddits.  Evidence here:
THIS IS NOT THE REAL MORONIC MONDAY Q&amp;A POST.
@_date: 2014-04-21 14:11:20
is alt. He's using this made up censorship controversy to drive users to his alternate bitcoin subreddits.  He also posted a fake Mornic Monday post this morning for the same purpose.
Evidence here: 
I already called him out on it and now all three posts are deleted.  These guys are just using the censorship accusation to try to game @_date: 2014-02-23 18:35:35
Correct.  discussed this yesterday and posted the original IRC log from when he warned Mark about it last September:
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:42:44
I bought one via the Gyft app when I was at the register at Kohl's.  I had a credit card ready just in case the transaction didn't go through, but it processed instantly.  The girl at the register thought it was awesome that I could just buy a card instantly through my phone and she could just scan it in.
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:42:06
So I don't have to run to the ATM to transfer money to someone who's already in the same room as me.
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:03:23
I think most Internet savvy people are aware of the pitfalls of PayPal by now. It's my money, not PayPal's. If I'm receiving the money I want it in my wallet, not theirs. 
Also, I'm not too keen on involving my bank account in such a transaction, even if there was a free way to do this between US based banks. 
Bitcoin already solves the problem perfectly for me. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:51:31
It certainly seems like it. All the people that regularly troll this sub are suddenly highly upvoted across these attack threads. Until now there have been no complaints about censorship on this sub. Then all of a sudden tons of upvotes for vague claims about censorship. 
I'll keep an eye on the situation before deciding one way or the other, but this certainly fits the patten of the other coordinated attacks that have happened against this sub. 
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:17:55
I'm getting that impression in your case. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:02:23
One last explanation.  I can send my bitcoins quickly and easily from my phone because it's digital.  I can not do that with dollars because I'd have to physically hand over dollars which I must go to the ATM to access.  Yes, I do know normal people that have bitcoin wallets now, so it's no big deal.  No, not everyone has a bitcoin wallet yet, so I can still hand over physical cash, but it will be nice when I don't have to bother with it anymore.
I just realized your username is probably meant to be "ironic" so I won't bother you any further about this.
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:02:21
Fair enough.  Thanks for editing your post to reflect that you are referring to "perceived dubious activity" rather than something with specific evidence.  I do agree that reddit should allow mods to make their moderation public, but so far they have refused despite requests from many moderators.  This would be a boon to redditors as well as honest mods on the site.
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:27:04
Um, no shit Madden?  That doesn't change the fact that bitcoin solves the problem for those of us who have already adopted it and doesn't require running to the ATM to get cash. I personally don't get paid in cash so I have to get it from the ATM or bank at some point. 
The question was why anyone would use it other than internationally. I've answered that question pretty clearly. Sorry if it wasn't enough to help you understand.

If anything, the miner is indelibly recording the transaction.  They may not know who owns the wallets, but it's a step beyond what you get from a cash transaction.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:07:52
Probably not much of a consolation, but I get what you meant.
@_date: 2019-12-17 02:54:58
Exactly.  The fact that someone in our government was talking shit about encryption like that was the endorsement.

No his story is that he's the one dating the sister and he's got nothing against the brother.  He just hates r/bitcoin according to his post below. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:36:54
Don't worry about me. You need to take a look at yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:45:09
You just went to an online forum on Christmas Day and posted that he and everyone else who gave bitcoins for Christmas are huge douches. It's obvious you either have something against him, or you have something against bitcoins. The more you post the more you seem like a troll that just wants attention. Sorry your Christmas sucks so bad. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:08:52
He's been trolling r/bitcoin for a while if you check his history. The entire story was a fabrication. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:02:57
Particularly odd the fact that he's asking for legal advice yet doesn't mention what country he's in other than it's not the US.
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:05:09
You can buy a gift card with them at gyft.com for Amazon or like a hundred other places. Way easier than an exchange plus they get 3% back. No personally identifying info required either. I was pretty impressed. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:05:39
Same with my friends. I told them they could hang on to it, use it to buy a gift card for Amazon or any of the tons of other places on gyft.com, or sell it back to me for cash.  So far they're all holding as far as I know. 
Also, the submitter seems unaware that you need zero personal info to buy a gift card with your bitcoins, and you get 3% back for using Bitcoins. 
Edit: Just scanned the last couple weeks of the submitters history. It's a bunch of trash talk against bitcoin and women. This is just another troll post.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:16:32
Honestly the submitter seems like an ungrateful douche.  I mean who goes to a bitcoin forum on Christmas just to trash talk their girlfriend's brother because they don't like their gift? I also think it's highly likely that the submitter is just a troll who knew this story would get a rise out of people. Think about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:47:39
Bitcoin is a disruptive technology and as it continues to gain popularity it is certain that we'll see more shills showing up to attempt to preserve the status quo.  Following them will be the useful idiots that parrot what they say.
Then you have your trolls which are people seeking attention but have nothing useful to offer so they make up controversial posts or simply post inaccurate information that they know people will respond to correct. 
Considering his history contains a bunch of anti-women posts as well as anti-bitcoin posts, I'd say he's just in it for the attention. If he's a shill then he's doing a poor job of it. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:14:20
He does in the comments more than once but never responds to anyone that asks which country. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:57:00
Because they get to choose if they want a gift card or to hold onto the bitcoins. And if they do want a gift card they get to choose which type of gift card they'd like. I turned out to be a great gift idea this year, but I admit at first I had some misgivings about giving them to people. In the end everyone was more interested in holding onto them than spending them which somewhat surprised me. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:40:42
I just have offline wallets for the coins I'm saving and an online wallet that I load from coinbase for spending.
So I save some and spend what I need. Not really any difference from cash in that sense.
