I never heard it was off - I thought it was planned for Thursday. Either way, thanks for your guys' replies. With the replies, I've decided to go ahead and make the purchase because I buy frequently enough that highs and lows average out as long as it won't be a crazy decrease after the test.

I've been loving Gemini after Coinbase essentially shut down my account. If I remember correctly, you don't need much verification before you can purchase large amounts via a wire transfer. I use a credit union that does wire transfers for free and over the phone so I don't even have to go in.

If you're interested in btc, a couple hundred dollars is definitely worth it just for the experiment I think. I started with a hundred just to watch it and get the hang of exchanges, etc and thought it was fun regardless of whether it increased or not.
After that experiment, I personally put in all my money that I was willing to lose, which ended up being all my money. I'm young and only have a couple bills l so I could lose all my money and be fine.
I don't know that I would reccomend someone put all their money they can lose into btc but considering my circumstances, that's what I determined was the best bet given all available data and my preference for reward (AKA risk).
But one thing I learned too late which caused unnecessary risk is to not leave your btc on an exchange. If you do, the exchange or hackers could take all your btc. Research wallet options instead and preferably, learn how hardware wallets work and how to make multiple backups of your recovery seed and keep them in multiple safe locations.
