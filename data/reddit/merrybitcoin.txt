Awesome, glad to hear that, happy holidays and all the best :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:15:31
Thanks, we only planned on doing it for a few hours one night, but it was so easy and fun once we found Gyft that we decided to keep on going :) Merry Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:22:25
If MtGox adds BTC/BKW I'll be sure to contact you.

Thanks, trying to help as many people as we can... one Double Whopper at a time :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:46:31
Received, thanks again and happy holidays, we're helping a ton of people, it's been a lot of fun so far. Thanks for the contribution and all the best, Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:27:29
Thanks, it's been a lot of fun so far, we've been able to help around 70+ people now with Burger King, CVS Pharmacy cards and other things. We've been enjoying it so we're going to try to keep it going through to Christmas. Hopefully it also brings some extra positive attention to Bitcoin and all the things that can be purchased with it, such as Double Whoppers with cheese :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:36:25
Fantastic, have a great trip and happy holidays.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:41:24
No problem, enjoy, happy holidays :)

I think the major exchanges may have difficulty cashing people out in truckloads of cheeseburgers :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:35:01
Going to make new posts and start at about 11AM EST, and stay up for as long as I can. I'll mention Bitcoin and Gyft more prominently this time around. I still feel as though most people don't realize you can buy "real" things with Bitcoin, such as Burger King gift cards etc, so it'll double as a neat sort of live demonstration :) Have a great day!
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:34:52
Also, just saw your contribution, we'll put it to good use, thank you and happy holidays.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:10:28
Well, I was more hoping people here would see what we've been doing and want to contribute to make it last longer so that we can help more people. Currently, only myself and friends have contributed, but yes, I suppose you could ask for stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:35:56
Thanks!, We posted here a few hours ago...
We were hoping to help some more people and get a bit of positive attention for bitcoin, I've never posted to before but it seems there was almost a systematic downvoting of even the most positive of comments, just really odd behavior. Maybe that's normal for that particular subreddit, I've never noticed that before though, comments where someone was saying thanks for helping them would have -5 in a matter of seconds it seemed, really strange. Maybe I shouldn't have used the word Bitcoin in the title itself, oh well, anyway, happy holidays to you all, take care and all the best :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:23:52
No worries, just trying to help those who could use it most at the moment. Have a great holidays, take care and all the best.

Myself and a friend have donated somewhere around 2.4 Bitcoins so far over the past 3 days, when we started 1 BTC was worth nearly $800, with the recent fall we've lost a whole lot of Double Whoppers, but we're trying to make the best of it :) 
We'd setup a fresh bitcoin address (1MzUXkMbXFopNdhfidcEVQbBpudN6e9Ypi) for anyone who may like to contribute after the first day but hadn't received any contributions at all until about an hour ago, and it looks like we've now received 3 transactions totaling 0.041 BTC from strangers which is wonderful. Our plan is to keep helping people until we're completely out of funds. Hopefully this will bring a little extra positive attention to Bitcoin, and people seem to be surprised that you can so easily purchase things like food and gift cards. We've been having a lot of fun so far, Happy Holidays and Merry Bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:56:58
Thanks for contributing, we'll put it to very good use. Happy  holidays, take care and all the best.

Merry Bitcoin Everyone :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:39:03
Just read it, we've been receiving a lot of messages today sorry :) I'll send you back a PM, take care and all the best, happy holidays.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:30:35
Thanks man, we're going to give away a ton of Burger King tonight :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:49:18
Appreciate it but we'd like to stay anonymous, thank you though for the thought. Happy holidays and all the best.
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:37:18
Thanks again, Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 01:55:48
Thanks for the tip, we set it up so bitcointips go to the same Merry Bitcoin address, we'll put it to good use, thanks again and happy holidays :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:30:01
Thanks!, every bit helps, we'll put it to good use, Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:11:36
For anyone interested in joining us in Merry Bitcoin... If anyone else would like to contribute we will be donating 100% of the balance of 1MzUXkMbXFopNdhfidcEVQbBpudN6e9Ypi to those who could use it most, if anyone wants to donate Altcoins please see our initial post that we made here: [Merry Bitcoin! - Giving Back for the Holidays](
**Current Exchange Rates (Dec 19th, 5:50PM EST)**
1 BTC = 204.5 BKW (Burger King Whoppers)
1 LTC = 5.6 BKW (Burger King Whoppers)
We've so far been able to help nearly 100 individuals and would like to keep going through to Christmas if possible. We'll spend every last penny (satoshi) on helping those who could use it most, till we're out of funds. Happy holidays and Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:43:59
It didn't feel like individuals, it seemed very automated, someone would post something like "thanks for sending me pizza yesterday", and with-in two seconds it'd be at -5 downvotes, I haven't seen anything like that before. Maybe is just a competitive subreddit with a lot of bots, today was my first time ever posting there. Thanks for the help and message, happy holidays and merry bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:13:48
Ah this is perfect, thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-24 01:33:51
Thanks, unfortunately it looks like our video won't be going much higher, I think using Bitcoin in the title was maybe a mistake, I think "Happy Holidays" would've been much better in the title, oh well, happy holidays :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 02:21:57
Bitcoin Address for Merry Bitcoin:
And yes, Gyft has been pretty fantastic to use, we simply made a Gmail for Merry Bitcoin and have been sending through Gyft to the emails of those who could use a little help from the name "Merry Bitcoin", Gyft doesn't require any other details or info than that.
Happy holidays and all the best :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:06:38
No problem, Happy Holidays and Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:37:50
Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:42:08
Thank you to the 3 individuals who donated .041 BTC earlier, and to whoever donated 50 DOGE.
I'm not sure how many whoppers 50 DOGE buys but I'll look up the conversion rate :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:12:24
Update: We've been going for about 3 hours now, and have so far sent out around 15 gift cards to those who need it most, we'll keep at it until we're out of money :)
If you'd like to follow what we're doing check out: [Here]( &amp; [Here](
We haven't had anyone else join us yet, so far it's only my friends and I contributing, if anyone's interested in joining us though we'll donate till we're completely out of coin, the more people we can help the better and we'll stay up till we've given to everyone we can.
Happy Holidays!

We've been holding Bitcoin Christmas for the past 3 days here: [Merry Bitcoin! Who could use a little help or a good sandwich?](
Edit: Also, we wanted to mention this on BitCoinTalk, but didn't want to use our normal accounts, and new accounts aren't allowed to post outside of the newbie section, so if anyone wants to help it'd be appreciated, happy holidays.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:16:29
Ah you found it yes, Gyft is pretty fantastic, very no-nonsense, and that they accept Bitcoin is wonderful. Thanks and have a great day.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:00:07
Currently, BTC/BKW (Burger King Whoppers) : 1 BTC = 194.84 BKW
@_date: 2013-12-25 03:06:06
Ha awesome, have fun, happy holidays :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:30:40
We even got some fancy Bitcoin flair it seems on [our food offer post over here]( Nice! Ha.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:39:26
Thank you sir, I've never had one but made one just now for you, our very first contribution actually was a 50 DOGE tip which I still haven't claimed. I'm not sure what the current DOGE to Burger King Whopper conversion rate is but we'll auto-convert any AltCoins over to BTC on Cryptsy and send it to our Merry Bitcoin BTC wallet.
DOGE: DJvzubVhD9VkW5Q7JDDo8ipdUNnxRADPjZ
Happy holidays and all the best.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:57:41
Thanks, it seems some people could really use it at the moment. I was hoping more people here might chip in, so far it's only been my friends and I, I may make another post here in a bit now that we're up and going, we've given about 40 food and cvs cards away over the past few hours and still have a whole bunch of coin left to go through. It looks like the mods at both places we posted will be able to sticky our posts till we run out of funds, hopefully some others chip in and we can go even longer, we'll see how it goes.
Thanks for kind words, take care and all the best.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:19:23
Glad to hear, happy holidays man.
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:58:16
Thanks a lot, we'll make sure it goes to those who could really use it. Happy holidays and Merry Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:38:03
It's great how easy it's been to send gift cards, the most time-consuming part has been determining who can really use the help, and who simply wants a free burger. We're trying our best though and I think we've been doing well so far making sure those who truly need it are helped.
