Keep it this way. Looks so much nicer and simpler.
@_date: 2011-08-04 01:28:35
Not to dismiss your claim, but do you have any proof?
@_date: 2011-08-27 16:15:20
No one would have bought it at that price..
@_date: 2011-08-17 18:57:38
You can't choose your buyers.

I think I will disable the custom styles because honestly I cannot stand this color scheme. The banner is fine, but I would revert to the old link color. It is easier to process which links we have visited. Or not maybe I get used to it. 
Thanks for changing the visited link color.

This is exactly why it will work out. It's the modern day Western Union with less checks, more anonymity and less fees.
Now how did this metamorphosis happen? From sitting in our basements just hacking to having a fortune. Then all these bitcoins critics crusify us, and journalists try to burn us. Then they get their hands on every bitcoin we owned. 
That's why all these FUD's are telling people not to get involved and telling us to sell our coins so they can try to get us off of these nets quickly.
If bitcoin is such a big menace then this shit doesn't make sense.
It's all political.
We just let our rigs mine and get wires in our bank accounts. It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothing and being able to have anything that we wanted. That's why we mine for these traders who don't have a thing except being filled with greed.

I can't use stolen bank accounts to buy bitcoins anymore? What a shame.
@_date: 2011-08-19 12:31:33
I came early to sell btc's for cash at the event preloaded on usb sticks. My table is set up next to rubicons.
@_date: 2011-08-27 09:25:04
SELL SELL **[SELL](

lol yea UABB founded today.. donate now so we can hire international investigators.
@_date: 2011-08-19 19:42:16
All sold out.
@_date: 2011-07-09 03:51:38
It's legit. They took all of my coins and my wallet.dat ended up on some ftp server and then funds withdrew.
@_date: 2011-08-17 00:14:17
I can give you a test address.
@_date: 2011-08-04 16:56:29
and then forget the password
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:11:24
Yes the mod changed it back to normal.
@_date: 2011-08-03 09:08:57
No need to panic, your btc's are gone. You put in only what you were willing to lose and use different passwords for your accounts? 
@_date: 2011-08-03 02:52:01
Leave cash in your mailbox and ill have someone pick it up.
