Consider giving to charity.
Fun fact, if you are reporting gains, you can use charitable donations as a tax credit.
Could end up saving you money, and helping a good cause (if you choose a good one)

The Shriners do GREAT work helping children with rare diseases and defects...they also actively improve the communities they are in...look into the Shriners if you are looking to donate for real

If you’re donating, look into the Shriners, they help kids with niche diseases, but also do a lot of good for their communities

Farting technology is being used by many big businesses now, and owning BUTT makes you a pioneer investor in Fartoshi’s vision.
(Yes these are fart jokes)

Didn't JPMorgan join the ETH alliance? They sound like they are trying to bring prices down to buy it up.

It's like 241 a share right now, but crypto stuff moves stock like crazy...got into overstock when they announced BTC acceptance and it almost doubled in a few months...stocks are fun

Yes...invest as much as you can while you are still young (take unnecessary things from your life and use the money you would have spent on them to invest) and by the time in your mid 30s you should, at minimum, have an easy retirement nest...at best, you’ll be swimming in Lambos.
Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere, so it will remain a strong investment...but also get into stocks/PMs and other appreciating assets...diversification is the key to success (most of the time).
Also remember to not have a weak hand and sell ok down market fluctuations....if BTC crashes 2000 in a day...HOLD IT, don’t ever sell at a loss unless you ABSOLUTELY have to.
Good luck bud
