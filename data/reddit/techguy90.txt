I like this idea. I think it would be awesome to hand out paper wallets along with instructions on the USB. My only worry is that they will get confused as to how they should remove the bitcoin from the paper wallet. Perhaps I could include some instructions on that process.

Seriously considering that password.

Nice save, nice save.

All I did was download the Coinbase app before Apple pulled it from the App Store. I'm not deleting it. That's how I have it haha.

About the article yes, but the Subway mention is buried down the bottom of the post. Figured the community would want to see this. Don't care about karma, just want to spread the awesome news! We might see widespread Subway adoption in the future, especially after it has been rumored that Starbucks has something planned for around Thanksgiving. 
EDIT: Opps, didn't see this! Awesome! Sorry for repost guys!

For right now the website redirects to the Facebook page (working on a mobile friendly site). 
Also have a Twitter account: 
My goal is to share all of the latest Bitcoin news, prices, etc across social. I'll be pulling from multiple sources, including this sub. 
I'm also using this as a personal learning experience for my first ever iOS project. I plan on building a beautiful iOS 7 ticker app with the latest price, volume, difficulty, and news in the palm of your hand. 
I'm also currently looking for others who might be interested in helping to post content/devs willing to review the app. Message me if you are interested in helping out!

Well the QR code on the iPad is preprogrammed to have the exact amount the customer owes. So I scan that QR code with Coinbase (lucky I download the iOS app before Apple pulled it) and hit send. The transaction happens instantly, it was pretty amazing to watch.

Best Reddit comment I've read all day, I tip my hat to you sir.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:35:21
If they retweet this......
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:09:44
I had no idea! Awesome!!!! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:36:04
My friend took this perfect shot of the transaction, looks like it belongs on the cover of TIME. Also, my No Shave November beard is looking beastly. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 09:52:55
Correct. Meaning whatever the USD conversion is at the time of purchase is what you pay. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:55:45
I love the bitcoin community. You guys are awesome. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:09:18
Big time. 15 views as of this response. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:35:38
Hahaha this was our 2nd transaction, the first one was $18. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:35:46
Correct, and there has been local coverage on it as well as national coverage. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:44:02
OP here. This is amazing. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:00:12
Not sure what this means, the transfer happened instantly.

He also [nailed the in-store experience]( He wasn't there when I visited, I actually went on the day this was filmed I believe so that makes sense.

That's not my middle finger? The photo was taken by my friend who is a professional photographer (although this was taken with his phone).  
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:32:41
Thanks! I felt like there was a lot of noise in the space but nothing to kind of pull it all together and keep people informed across multiple media outlets. I also hate pretty much every iOS ticker app on the market, so why not build a better one? :p
