There is no way to tell whether or not the price will move up or down in the near or distant future. Anyone who tells you that they know BitCoin is about to fall/drop in price is lying to you. No one knows for sure. There are so many old reddit threads from 6 months or a year ago, some of them highly upvoted, which insist things like, “the whole market is about to crash”, “sell your BitCoin and extra gpu’s now while you can”, or, “any investor worth his salt is selling their portfolio NOW.” They usually give some techy-sounding, analysis-driven explanation for how they **just know** that the whole crypto market is about to explode. Yet, by panicking and selling in July 2017, they lost thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars. The market didn’t crash, in fact its worth increased by over 10x over the next 6 months.
The best that you can do is keep track of the news. It has a fairly significant impact on the short term value of  BitCoin. Good news = price spike, bad news = price drop. But no one, absolutely no one, knows what will happen to it long term.

I did some research and you’re right. Downloading NiceHash as we speak. I didn’t think about being able to buy alts with the profit. Just goes to show what a noob I am....
Thank you for your thoughtful and detailed reply.

Any recommendations on public pools? This is a term I haven’t heard before, but I assume it operates via some kind of software or website, similar to NiceHash and MinerGate?
