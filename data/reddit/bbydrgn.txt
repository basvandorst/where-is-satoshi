6000 btc will be worth more than your 700,000 any day of the week buddy. Don't ever say you were in a worst situation without knowing what that person went through.

Because people like you are the ones who say the same thing no matter the price, just another emotional trader that's going to get salty when it does moon.
@_date: 2019-11-28 20:10:50
Just realized earlier today, newegg had a BTC option too :)
@_date: 2018-10-05 21:53:10
You have a point but in the trading world we go by percentages because we can simply buy more BTC at 30 bucks
@_date: 2018-10-12 05:45:43

@_date: 2019-06-04 05:24:02
Honestly, I recommend dealing with TD to avoid bullshit like this. This is ridiculous and they should have no right to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:45:50

@_date: 2019-05-21 14:28:32
Goku and Vegeta is about to fight
