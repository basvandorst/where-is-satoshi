There’s slightly less posts about Bitcoin this week and you expect 4K after holding strong at 9? Is this real life, lol?

The sarcasm was lost on you.

We got a big shot over here �� 
But seriously I do too and I’m sure so do many of the other people that posted on this thread, you were just the only one who couldn’t shut his ego off for a moment to answer the question in principle.

At this point I don’t see technology as something that will increase bitcoin’s price. There’s already a lot of better coins for regular usage lightning network or not. 
Bitcoin to me is just a store of value, and the only way that’s going to go up in price is with overall continuation of adoption of cryptocurrency. 
Right now the market just took a hit and to a lot of new people it’s a scary time to jump in. Even the veterans are licking their wounds and haven’t put back a lot of the money taken out of the market. Wait till we stabilize for a little while, then the veteran money will come back. From that point the ever increasing market will attract the newbies once again and the price will rise quickly in a snowball effect.

I feel as the tech would happen with or without me if it is as truly revolutionary as many projects bill themselves to be. 
That being said, I invested my money to make more money.

Slightly old news but one rapper accepting bitcoin for one album and then forgetting about it doesn’t exactly prove much in this use case scenario.

As of right now I can’t pay my bills with BTC so I’d have to instantly convert BTC to fiat if I got paid in BTC, meaning I’d incur fees right from the start. So in that case; fiat.

Stopped watching when you said trading bitcoin was banned in India. 
Read the release statements more carefully before you post a video further pushing false information.

I don’t think you understand ����‍♂️ oh well

It matters a little bit. I’m in the boat of wanting to put another 10k into bitcoin. If I buy now I’ll just get 1 for around $8500 but if it dips more I can get more so when that rebound does happen my profit is much greater. 
Does it even matter if it goes to $1000? Yes. Then I would be able to buy 8 for the price of 1 currently and let’s say it goes to $25,000 one day. That means I would have $200,000 worth of bitcoin versus $25,000.

Would you pay for something in gold if you could even if it was easy? 
I wouldn’t because I know gold will go up in value down the road so I’d be losing potential future capital. Same with Bitcoin, it’s become a store of value often compared to gold. If you wouldn’t pay for something with Gold why would you pay in bitcoin?

Meh just shows how unhappy he is with something in his life. Hoping for people to lose their money and being disappointed when they don’t. 
There’s enough sunshine for everyone bro, don’t be so depressed.
Try to be happy for total strangers once in your life and see how it has a positive impact on your own mindset.

Oh I fully never expect it to drop to $1,000. That’s not what I was saying. I was answering the point of would it matter if it did. Which yes, it does.

You got along with everyone in middle school? I didn’t. I got along with most, but there were always 1 or 2 assholes that popped up here and there. Pretty similar to the Crypto situation actually ��

Yes it’s possible.
