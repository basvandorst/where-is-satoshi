Finally Bitcoin... a place to secretly store value after your wife tries to take your house and half of everything you own. 
Why on earth would you tell her how much you have?  Keep your bitcoin and porn secret fellas lol

Well I guess on the bright side in 10 years or so (the average long term failure rate for most long term marriages in this modern day and age) when bitcoin is at 100,000 to 250,000 per coin you will be happy with 50% ; D

At some point visa stopped allowing us to use coinbase too. The jokes gonna be on them when other institutions begin to compete with their services because they didn’t want to evolve with a changing financial scene

This is about killing the ICO market and making as much money with futures as possible before making as much money with ETFs as possible.

Eat these words.
Originally ancient man traded food.  Food had an expiration date but the amount of effort it took in order to acquire said food (let’s say wheat) was understood to be less perishable.  So... guess what?  Ancient man needed a representation of the work they did.  Something that was relatively hard to find so “counterfeit” work could not just be readily created.
Enter rare earth metals.  Everyone just agreed that “this means work” and therefore it can be exchanged for food.
Ancient man couldn’t give two s***s about the conductivity or radiation shielding benefits of gold.  That is a ridiculous argument.  As civilization advanced goods and services were also added to food and what  “proof of work” represents in the form of said gold.
So if everyone around the world agrees that a certain amount of bitcoin = a certain amount of fiat which translates to food, goods and services.  The guess what?  Mic drop �� ��
I eat words better because I am actually educated ����  ♟

It has exactly the same amount of conceptual value as gold metal you can’t eat and paper dollars you can’t eat.  It’s worth whatever people agree upon. 
Can we put this argument to rest now?  Do you have any idea how utterly common and intrinsically worthless crystallized carbon is?

It’s only a paper loss until you sell it.  If you HODL bitcoin long enough you know that it has done this before.  It’s low because of Bitcoin futures.  Soon Nasdaq will be opening even more futures.  
Eventually.... if there is ever a ETF everyone will wish the didn’t sell.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:19:40
If you can’t see a bitcoin ETF then what would be the point of investing in Bitcoin? : ). One already exists in Sweden.
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:03:11
Probably sometime after it reaches the 1,400 - 840.00 range would be my guess.

People don’t like the truth.  The divorce rate hovers around 50% (just below it) annually.  So people think that getting a divorce is a 50/50 shot like flipping a coin because they don’t understand math.
That little word “annually” actually means once a year.  That means the divorce rate is statistically allot more like having to flip a coin and having it come up heads EVERY  year in order to stay married.  In other words, it’s practically impossible to flip heads every year of your life and stay married.  Although anomalies will exist in any statistical sample (which is why people think they can “make it”) 
That’s your bet.  Antiquated laws in the United States all but certainly guarantee that you will have all of your savings divided between you and your “forever spouse” whether they earned any of that money or not.  Whether they saved or squandered, worked or was out of work.  If kids are involved and you are a man then rest assured that your wife is going to get the house because the government has figured out that it’s better policy to do that, because those kids will cost less (to the government) If they kick the man out after dividing his funds those kids get a nice start on life and need less assistance. 
You can use all of this for your writing btw : D bottom line, this is the real world everyone lives in whether they like it or not.  But hey... nobody likes the truth.  I’m sure you will indeed flip heads forever.  
One last thing......  you know what else literally ALL my married fiends hear ALL the time?  Stop buying bitcoin.  Stop. Stop. You’ve bought enough.  Stop now.  Now just imagine for one second that what you suspect will happen with bitcoin (another moonshot) is ACTUALLY going to happen.  What if it REALLY does?  Then what effect has your marriage had on you (and your spouse and your kids) lives?  Really let that sink in.

Tie up the alt coins in vague unclear legislation. Secretly fine them and make them pay investors back while limiting the future of ICOs.  Eventually settling on crypto’s that come in line with government regulations sufficiently enough so that the end user can be tracked enough to claim taxes in the fiat of their home nation.
Ya know... kinda like what’s happening right now.

Buy back 10,000,000 + 10%.... profit?  It’s not really complicated ��
@_date: 2019-02-26 18:48:21
It just so happens that someone flash dumped 6.7m dollars worth of ether on that day.  So evidently there was enough liquidity for that.

I guess you’d owe 40% capital gains tax on the profits earned on every Satoshi.  
Put in 100.00
Turn it into 200.00
Then I guess you’d get to spend 160.00 and have to give 40.00 to the government.  It’s still more then zero but it is still the same as gold ��

Random guy on Reddit doesn’t want news of the first crypto ETF being posted again because ETFs historically don’t effect anything (or lead to more ETFs)

Looking at that graph, technically it doesn’t quite look like we’ve reached despair quite yet. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:43:46
It’s not caused by those things.
Have you noticed that bitcoin has kinda been following the market as of late? That’s because there are actually allot of hedge funds in bitcoin now.  They are leveraging their risk exposure to the general market and doing the same with the crypto section of their portfolio.  
Welcome everyone, to the wonderful world of unintended consequences.  As bitcoin becomes more mainstream it also becomes its own investment asset class and is therefore tied to general market sentiment.  Go figure. One day it might rise when the market dips like gold, but the trust isn’t there yet.  So it’s following it instead.

I see this pick and think: “She is thinking that he knows that she’s been cheating, but she is mad at him for thinking that she’s cheating even though she has been cheating because he should believe her 100% of the time no matter what regardless of whether or not she is cheating” 
He, on the other hand... should be thinking entirely about his bitcoin plots instead. 
See what I did there? : D

My personal research points to bitcoin hitting around 2,000 soon prior to going up.  Maybe as low as 840.   If you buy you better be prepared to HODL
