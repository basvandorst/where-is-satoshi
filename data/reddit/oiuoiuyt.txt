i am thinking about doing the same in case someone wants to buy a small amount of bitcoin from me.
not everyone has a smartphone and i can count the people who i know can keep their phones secure using one hand only.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:46:18
same story except it's euros.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:05:34
you must be doing something wrong.
how the fuck can you pay that much in fees for bitcoin?
also how the fuck is it possible that your credit card does not charge fees?
we don't really use CCs in europe but i thought they all involve ~2% fees for the vendors which the vendors then add on top of their products?
are you telling me you are getting a 2% discount when you pay with your credit card?
AND you are getting 50$ sent to your account every other month?
please sit down and think for an hour where those 50$ come from...
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:48:42
apparently not.
how would you have known that the price was going to go down?
you made the same mistake the SR bust panickers made.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:51:55
well, not here.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:56:34


so why is deflation bad again? or does this only apply to one-time-price-falls and not constant decline?
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:13:21
are you 12 and fucking retarded or just living on a lonely island with no internet access, printed press, tv or other news source?
seriously, how can you be alive and able to use a computer when you have absolutely no clue what is going on around you?
oh, looking at your history explains a lot.
there is so much wrong with you I'm not even gonna list it here :D
are you by any chance related to JoeyC, little troll friend?
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:39:53
HAHAHA are actually taking this seriously and think we're all into animal hides :D
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:21:28


how is this even legal?
how can they have such power to tell merchants what they can and can't accept as payment?
flabbergasted european here.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:43:31
well can you maybe paraphrase it?
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:24:57
following that logic you also have to take into account inflation of fiat currency and adoption of bitcoin currency which automatically makes bitcoin the winner as btc adoption &gt; btc inflation.
oh and then there's bailouts, cost of printing fiat money, corruption,...

maybe some chinese PBOC official had a funny look on his face.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:56:48
telling people not to fall for FUD won't help.
 how many people did you see saying "oh i was wrong about china banning bitcoin" after february 2nd? or after the next deadline?
how many people did you see saying "oh seems like ghash.io wasn't working on a secret blockchain fork after all"?
how many people did you see saying "oh, panic selling my coins when gox lost his coins and then panic selling again when gox found his coins was moronic"?
all we can do is wait through the crash until all idiots sold their coins so we can return to natural growth.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:26:59
why? no more credit cards = no more credit card fees.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:03:13
yes, he does. not sure which one it is because april fools confused me. or he could just have used a bitcoin key.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:01:55
the problem with WW3 is that nukes are bad for computers because of EMPs iirc.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:52:10
no idea but [look here]( and on coinmap, maybe you'll find something.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:40:00
i think we need alternatives to bitcoin fog because they're quite expensive if all you want to do is some simple tumbling to preserve privacy but whoever runs it should either have a good reputation or not be anonymous.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:46:27
[actually in some cases placebos work better than actual medicine.](
i agree though that OP's offer looks scammy. he should advertise it on facebook.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:20:34
that means everyone is paying higher prices to cover OPs credit card fees.
what you said is a brilliant argument why using bitcoin instead of credit cards will lower your fees and is in complete agreement with what i posted.
OP is implying he is getting a discount for paying with his credit card.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:05:01
it's the end of the month, maybe people who went full bitcoin are selling to pay rent?
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:53:37
old news, don't care.
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:24:10
haters gonna hate.
but i think writing it on the sides would be a lot better and less intrusive than stamping it on the center.
oh and a life tip: never say "cringe" if you want to be taken seriously. i had to check your history to make sure you're not a troll or NSA/GCHQ agent.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:55:06
because there is no reason to use other coins except for experimentation.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:09:12
it is if you are worried about weaknesses in ECDSA or progress in quantum computing :P
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:34:37
oh nice. yeah, i guess EVE economists know what they are talking about and iceland seems like one of the nations that should be more open to bitcoin than most others, considering your ties to wikileaks, the pirate party and privacy in general.
don't let tulipfutures get you down, he's one of the regular trolls/shills here.
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:51:42
@_date: 2014-04-27 12:47:28
apparently not.
how would you have known that it was the top? what if it had risen to 5k and crashed to 2k?
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:29:42
OP knows this, look at his history.
it doesn't even make sense as dogecoin fees = bitcoin fees. not sure if you somehow missed this but nobody is forcing you to pay fees for bitcoin transactions. fees are not part of the protocol, they are part of mining software.
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:12:20
no idea how to set fees on bc.info, i don't use them and i don't trust them.
you can import your private key in a bitcoin desktop client and send your coins from there. they usually add the fee automatically (and tell you how much it is).
you don't need to know this:
the fee is just the difference between the inputs and outputs, so if you have 0.0049668฿ and only send 0.0049002฿ to other addresses the network will take 0.0000666฿ as a fee.
in your previous transactions a fee was added, not sure why there was none in this transaction.

how many people said "oh, selling my coins after silk road got shut down was the worst decision of my life"?
and remember that those people never ever got a chance to buy back in at a price even remotely as low as the one they sold their coins for.
one would expect this to be a lesson to the ones after them...
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:03:37
stop impersonating me!
@_date: 2014-04-27 11:50:57
you're joking, right? Plan ฿ is the most perfect slogan bitcoin could come up with, it was even featured in Rap News.
it's on par with One World, One Currency and BYOB - Be Your Own Bank.
