I normally just lurk here, but I think there’s one thing that is extremely important to understand in your question. It doesn’t matter what percentage of bitcoin you own. By that I mean if you invest $500 whether that is .005 or 5 bitcoins ROI is the same. If the price double what you invested doubles. So think less about having to own a full bitcoin and more about the amount that you are comfortable investing into it.
If bitcoin has a 20% gain in the next few years (which I think is ultra conservative) and bcash has a 2% gain, just because you own a full BCH your ROI is still worse.

Talking about lazy math and statistics have you heard of averages? When you talk about cherrypicked data and continue on utilizing the largest outlier it kind of undermines your point.

If a $500 rise and fall shakes them they shouldn’t consider themselves a hodler and neither should you. They are the exact opposite. Weak hand at best

I’d throw in googling “validity”. Kind of important in surveys when extrapolation to a significantly larger population is involved

Just think: when we blow through ATH (I’m bullish but hopeful for 2020) and start the ascent to the moon Jan 2018-june 2019 will look like the worlds greatest bear trap.

I have seen his nonsense for long enough to know better than buying into it. That’s why I didn’t put your name but just someone. It’s not relevant to the discussion to point at any poster who makes a prediction high or low because nearly every prediction is wrong.

Days like the last few are what reminds me of the big picture. I think everyday more people are enlightened to the fundamentals of bitcoin. It is going to be an exciting time through the next few decades

I think delusion is constantly posting a lot of unfounded, easily proven to be false, or clearly misrepresented “facts” on this subreddit. Your one redeeming quality is that you make yourself appear to be intelligent, and anyone can completely shred that facade when they apply an ounce logic to your statements.
You talk about delusion when you live in an imaginary world. 
Btw, yes someone made an overly optimistic prediction. Nearly 100% of people making predictions in BTC are wrong most of the time.

Funniest part is you must honestly believe what you’re saying is true. Sad, but funny nonetheless

Logic eludes some. My life keeps moving regardless.

It is healthy to ensure where you invest your money is safe. Bitcoin itself is secure. In my opinion the most secure of the crypto out there. This is a reason some complain about the time sending and receiving transactions occasionally. You can get a bit faster with others, but you give up security.
Bitcoin can be USED to scam people though. Like I said Bitcoin is secure, but people who con others use any tool people have interest and lack of understanding in. Don’t fall for the modern day Nigerian Prince type offers. Send .1 bitcoin I’ll send 10 back will never happen.
Keep getting educated on bitcoin. I am sure through reading and watching videos that exist you will come to your own conclusion of Bitcoins security. That option will always outweigh some random guy attempting to convince you on Reddit
