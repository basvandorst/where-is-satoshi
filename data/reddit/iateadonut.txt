can you point to such a blog post?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:41:10
Yeah... people's rationalizations.
People decide things with their heart, and then they ignore information that goes against it and are relieved when they see information that supports it, and they spit out their rationalizations.
I'm in the "No one can know anything and it's all just a crap shoot" camp, which is convenient, because I can say "See?" everyday.

They just mentioned on the news about 10 minutes ago that they were questioning him and they found he made less than $700 profit total... (the implication was that no one cares, I think)
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:36:49
Exactly.  I bought LU stock in 1999.  Went way up... it started crashing - I still hold the stock but as long as I don't sell I don't lose money.

I got an email from CME about the spread when it came out.  (I invest in silver so need to be informed when they increase reserve ratio's.)
I was taken aback when I saw that it's settlement cash based on the price at gemini, and that no BTC will ever change hands.  You can't even demand settlement in BTC, which you can for most metals contracts.

have you tried btcrecover?

Well, sure, we make our decisions by our emotions, and then we work hard to rationalize them, not the other way around.

if that's how you define bubble.  some people use standard deviations and other maths i don't understand.

Some of the BTC developers live on farms now.

I think he lost his password.

Nice to hear you found peace!  There's something only loss can buy.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:01:13
Yeah, this is a huge problem.  If you buy in now, you're saying that the people who bought in earliest SHOULD control the most wealth.

I'll take one, stamped today.  bubbles take about a year to diffuse, right?  good luck, peops.

maybe i should rename my title?  i thought "And now..." was clear enough... maybe change to "MSM FUD: And now..."

just sold my current holding which were quite a bit less than 0.05... this is all i have left.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:54:26
no, it's another definition of the same term.  you can extrapolate the meaning by looking previous bubbles.  silver was in bubbles twice since i was born and it returned the trendline.  the nasdaq was in a bubble around 2001 and returned to fundamental value.  you define it by standard deviations from the expected trendline/fundamental value.  if it passes such-and-such standard deviations... then you could define it mathematically.

this exactly.  BTC is worse than worthless: it's taking resources from important projects.

How many poets post to reddit.  This is incredible.

The libertarian spirit.  Since someone here donated 0.05 BTC, I guess I'll ask her to explain here why gov't assistance isn't available.

As these problems are fixed, the payments gateway has to start charging more to take care of these problems, and transfer costs become as large as more accepted forms of payment.

he didn't follow some simple rules.  there are plenty of local currencies:
the "liberty dollar" just crossed the legality line.
@_date: 2014-01-24 03:01:41
Thanks to whomever donated 0.05 BTC if you are reading this.

From the FAQ about Corvallis' local currency:
"There are numerous rules that must be followed for script money to be legal, for example: it has to be a different size than federal notes; it must not say “dollar” anywhere on the currency; and every note must be worth at least one dollar. HOURS are issued locally by people in our region rather than by a national government. They are just as taxable as U.S. Dollars, and it is illegal to counterfeit them."
Another rule is that "coin" is a term reserved to rounds minted by the US government, which is why mints, like nwtmint.com, who mint their own rounds call them 'rounds' and not 'coins':
I'm not sure how many rules the liberty dollar broke, but the most obvious one is that it said "dollar" on it.

How are you measuring the trend?
@_date: 2014-01-30 15:47:54
Still has a 4% EPS, and a 23 P/E - it's coming down from being expensive to more in line with the rest of the market.  It doesn't mean it's dying.

I think this is part of the appeal of dogecoin.

Put in $100 onto coinbase.  Then move it to [pro.coinbase.com]( (for lower fees).
Buy some different crypto-currencies that coinbase sells.
Make wallets.
Make some transfers.
Learn how to store your paper key.

It's tough.  I've been bitter about a tiny amount stuck in a wallet for years :(

It may be becoming one.  There was a jump in gold the same time as the jump in BTC last week.  My guess is they are all flight to safety dollars.

Nothing; they'd be locked up and dad would be dead due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound after not being able to deal with the regret of losing his password.

Yeah but how many of those tech stocks that make up the NASDAQ now are the same ones that were invested in the late 90s.
