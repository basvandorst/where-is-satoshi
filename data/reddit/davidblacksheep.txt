... But there is no audit there. Tether have been around for more than a year, and they haven't completed an audit. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:08:29
There's been a lot more noise about tether recently, because in the last week they have printed $650m worth. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:24:40
Burden of proof is on Tether to prove that they have all that money held in reserve. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:57:07
Printed tether is being used to buy crypto.  The argument is that any rally is artificial due to tether, and not representative the actual demand. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:30:37
... I'm one of the people who frequently mention that Tether is scam, and it's not because I'm a shill. 
It's because I genuinely think that's  the case - I guess I'm sounding an alarm. 
Remindme! one month.

No audit. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:18:05
.... There was plenty of media attention at the 300 and 1000 bubbles. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:20:59
I don't know wtf is going with your replies man. That's clearly just a blog with some animation re being a hacking warning. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:56:56
Only $6.4? I mean - Tether printed $.650bn  over just a week, soooo. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:01:07
I get that it's convenient. It's a good selling point and the idea is reasonable. But the implementation is a lie.  bitconnect worked fine as well,  until it didn't.
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:08:35
Wait till how bad it'll be after the Tether collapse happens. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:32:59
Does that preclude talking about tether or no? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:09:51
Does Bitfinex have a cash-out option? Tbh I would just try cashing out your fiat to test that you can. Maybe take a break from crypto for a month. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:12:31
\^ I actually agree. 
Presumably they could be making bank just earning money on the interest of the reserves. 
But if that were the case - why haven't they done an audit? 
Possibly what it is - that they lost money at some point, and so started 'borrowing' their reserves and then have got into a slipperly slope of 'I just need to win this gamble to break even'. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:28:10
.. Tether claim that their money is backed by fiat. 
We can't prove that they don't. Just as we can't prove that there aren't fairies at the end of your garden. 
But the simplest explanation is that they don't. It follows then - that it's a scam. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:58:19
... until the exchange you're using collapses taking your crytpo/fiat with it. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:45:31
No worries. It's a pretty common misunderstanding. The more informed people are, the better. 
And all of this doesn't mean that there aren't problems with the system. In the GFC for example -  it seems like the banks never took responsibility for their screw up -  the tax payer bailed them out. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:25:36
I strongly recommend you take a good look at the tether scam before you put money in. They're exponentially printing money. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:56:47
Do you have any evidence that they are? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:25:26
Shouldn't Bitcoin work without the state propping it up? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:59:22
My understanding is that when you sell on bitfixex - you're actually getting tether, not USD. 
Can someone confirm?: 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:17:51
I thought Tether was offtopic here? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:33:06
Presumably in this case,  the bank didn't pay the retailer the transactions were made to. Or they took the hit themselves. 
I recommend reading this Q&amp;A which addresses double entry accounting and what you're referring to 
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:45:44
Here's the thing. If Bitcoin does shoot up to say meet 100k, what do you say happens to all the mining/electricity costs? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:20:51
Burden of proof is on tether to prove that their tokens are backed by fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:17:24
... If you think banks can't become insolvent - what do you think was happening during the global financial crisis? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:14:50
Right. But I was just pointing out why people are talking about tether. It seems that they're printing exponentially more money. Will it be another $200m tomorrow? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:50:21
What do you care? If bitcoin is valuable in itself - you won't care if other people are buying or not. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:11:16
You missed tether 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:30:55
... Are you saying that these are things that aren't issues worth investigating? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:52:51
That's not what the website says. Website says each tether is backed 1:1 with fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:31:33
About 5k
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:25:06
... The GFC was only 10 years ago. 
The 'making money from thin air' you refer to is a misunderstanding.  When a bank creates a loan 'from thin air'  they also create a liability for themselves -  they have to honour that loan. That's where they can get in trouble -  like they did during the GFC -  creating a bunch of loans that people used to buy into a property bubble, and were unable to pay the bank back. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:44:49
... They've printed $650m USDT over the last week,  and can be using wash trading to pump up the volume of BTC to make it look like more is being traded than actually is. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:58:59
The claim :
- tether is a crypto that is 1:1 backed by fiat. 
- you can cash out your tether to fiat at any time. 
- tether is convenient in the crypto space, because it has the stability of fiat,  while being easier to transfer  without wire transfers and know your customer etc. 
However :
- there's no proof that each tether is backed by fiat. They have done no audit. 
- you can't cash your tether at the tether.to website. 
- Many exchanges,  notably bitfinex  are only letting you cash out as tether, not fiat 
- in the past week, tether has printed $650m tether. Again, there's no evidence that this is backed by fiat reserves. 
The  concern :
- tether and bitfinex are printing tether to prop the price of crypto up. 
- it's easy to put your fiat into exchanges, but hard to get it out (they'll offer you tether instead) 
- it looks like tether is having to print exponentially more tether to keep the price up. 
- when they're unable to keep doing this (because the whole thing looks ridiculous),  the whole house of Cards collapses -  price of all crypto collapses,  some dodgier exchanges go insolvent -  like happened with Mt Gox. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 20:28:50
Check that you actually have USD and not USDT 
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:12:59
... Does anyone think that Tether printing will affect BTC prices and exchanges? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:21:40
An audit,  like they claim happens ,  would suffice. But it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:20:52
Lol wtf is going on in this thread. Are all the other posters OPs sock puppets? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:54:43
Short answer yes.  Who knows what the real amount of fiat in the market is, but tether we know is being treated as $1 fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:04:45
See wash trading. 
They can do something like : print $100M tether. Use that to buy Bitcoin. Use that to buy ethereum. Use that to buy Bitcoin again. And so on. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:22
The Mt Gox $1000 bubble popped over about two years, IIRC
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:35:22
Now do bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:13:23
It's almost as if (good) fiats have a steady and predictable amount of purchasing power. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:46:18
It took a year for the Mt Gox bubble to reach its final low. You can expect the same for this bubble. 
Expect a slow steady reduction of price for at least a year. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:12:08
Imagine the cost of mining and GPUs at a consistent $20k. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:04:18
I mean... a lot of people were criticizing bitcoin when it was worth $20k, and before then too. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:21:55
I'm not following. 
The point of journalism to is follow up and investigate things. Do you think that journalists _shouldn't_ consider if things might not be true? 
A bitcoin millionaire having trouble cashing out would make an interesting human interest story at the very least. 


This sounds like a general criticism of the media, which I guess is fair enough. We don't really see many human interest stories about someone whose gym routine and diet is making their life better either. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:34:32
How much did you end up buying? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:47:55
I'm talking to the OP who is saying 'best price this year'. Chances are the price is going to keep dropping for the rest of the year. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:07:21
By FUD do you mean legitimate criticisms of crypto/the crytpo space? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:39:01
Were you watching when the Mt Gox bubble happened? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:50:50
This is why many of us hate Bitcoin/the crypto eco system. 
It's all very well to say 'I told you so'  but there are real victims in it,  and it sucks to see otherwise good people contributing to the hype, because they had a chance of getting rich. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:09:49
That's right. The $1000 Mt Gox bubble took a solid year to reach its final low.
