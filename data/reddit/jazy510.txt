Just because you think it doesn't matter, does not make it so.  You think the credit card companies who pay for these types of fraud do it out of altruism and just foot the bill outta their own pockets?  Think again, for it's you and I as consumers who end up paying the tab.  Less fraud is a win all around, both for merchants and for customers.  Dismissing fraud because you think you're "protected" is no excuse for the fraudulence we're all paying for.  If you think that bitcoin is "extremely difficult to secure" then yes, we can agree, Bitcoin is most certainly not for you (yet, that is. There's always hope).

| Name one advantage a Wal-Mart consumer would have to purchase bitcoins vs using their credit card.
Well, for one, they have a 0% chance of having their account hacked and stolen, unlike when using a credit card at these hackable terminals.  e.g. Consider the Target Credit Card hack, or the Home Depot CC hack from earlier this year, etc. etc..  There are countless examples of this happening.

Is MtGox taking a page from BFL's "ships in 2 weeks" BS?  [Gox releases press release on Feb 15th]( fully two weeks after issues began, saying "6-hour downtime on deposits/transfers/withdrawals"  
6 hours only, eh?  Don't hold your breath...

Well there is that whole *other* $130 Billion dollar alt-coin market that you cannot* participate in without using the settlement layer that is Bitcoin.
(* - yes you can get into it by mining, or buying ETH to trade *some* pairs with, but the point remains that Bitcoin is **the** crypto settlement layer.)

Was the issue related to getting the private key off of it, or another technical issue, or something else?
@_date: 2018-11-18 21:16:32
So after you set it up the first time, it worked, then later, it stopped working?  Did you try recovering the PrivKey off of it and see if it responds after the seal was broken? (push a pin threw the hole indicated to reveal Private key).   worth a try.  
If it's a faulty stick, i'm sure they would exchange it for a working one.  Did you try contacting them (support for support?

ya, that math seems off.  I have a ~10KW array in Cali and it tops out around 9KW during the summer heat, and I get around 60-70KWh from it in the summer.  Sure MI has more summer sunlight, but afaik not triple.

Tradefortress, Bitfunder and Weexchange.co - i believe the BCT user [ukyo]( was also involved in the Bitfunder fiasco.  Bitfunder was one of the first "exchanges" where you could buy shares into, and crowdfund projects.  Heck, the first real BTC ASIC company, "ASICMiner" was even trading there, for over 1BTC / share for some time.  
The ASICMiner fiasco deserves its own thread, as that tale is RICH - who knows it?  The BCT member "[friedcat]( was the interface to ASICMiner the company.  I directly bought some USB ASIC sticks from friedcat back in 2013, and had no problems, but eventually I believe friedcat pulled an exitscam and absconded with a pile of coins and was never heard from again.
So many tales of scoundrels in the early days of Bitcoin.  Unfort. I have several examples of individuals who have knowingly defrauded me in cryptoland (usually for bunk miner deals, or group buys gone wrong), but hey, at least I sleep well at night.  You're only stealing from yourself, ya stilly goofs!  I wonder am I alone in that experience? Have many of you crypto vets also fallen victim to scams over the years, or am I just a sucker? I fully admit being a fool at times, and we all know about how they are soon parted with their monies...

There's plenty of legit targets to choose - eg. Garza's Paycoin is clearly a scam, but I don't see that's the case with BitShares - care to elaborate on why you make this unfounded accusation?  A link to a price history chart / marketcap is no proof of a scam.  BitShares has a lot going for it, imo. Both NXT and BTS seem to have some good innovations, good developers, and active communities.  LTC [seems (beyond) pretty dead]( to me, but not BTS.

Not sure about "unwavering support" - but this was news to me: [GoCoin Gains Strategic Investment from GAW Miners for Software Development Push]( - this was from December 2014, perhaps before Paycon[sic] was widely shown to be a farce.  
Accepting anything from Garza does seem mighty shady.

I think you may be confusing "marketing" with "discussing".  I'm not involved (apart from being an investor in certain assets), and make no claims as to the site's trustworthiness, only to its existence.  From the site's [terms &amp; conditions]( page:








[We do promise to list all holdings by the shareholders by providing a public btcaddress/asset/shares list live 24/7. (Click Here)](
This leaves our liabilities down to just BTC held in accounts with us.
We will do everything in our power to keep things as easy, painless, accurate and as fair as possible.
We promise to deliver the services of this site as accurately as possible and to the best of our ability to the users and to continue to try to grow with the community.
From the rather sordid pasts of several prior "exchanges" or other financial "services" in the BTC world - BitFunder's forthrightness seems somewhat refreshing.  At least they're telling you up-front the risks, and taking steps to limit their liability.  Will it be enough?  That's TBD...  I only found out about the site a few days ago, and seeing how it wasn't discused anywhere here on Reddit - thus the post.  Take it or leave it - no claims are made.

Most definitely, WeEcxchange.co's design, is not its strong point.  However, transferring btcs threw them, to BitFunder costs nothing, apart from 6 confirmations/blocks.  They also accept mtgox USD codes and some kind of Aussie &amp; Canadian currencies, IIRC.
