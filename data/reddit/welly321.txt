It's a meme where anytime something bad happens with bitcoin someone will say "this is good for bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:46:55
your both wrong. it's spelled their.

Some people get lucky. No one knows what the market will do 
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:49:17
I got the same thing. It was an issue with coinbase. In my case it worked out in my favor because it was for a buy at 10060 and I ended up getting it at 9950

Cant believe im the first one answering drugs .

sorry but no. if they invest, that increases demand and the price goes up. Obviously one family will have a negligible effect on price but the concept remains.

Wow you are so wrong.
I was going to explain it to you but I get the feeling you won't bother reading it so I'll just assume you are really bad at math and/or critical thinking skills

I highly doubt they will take a civil issue and turn it criminal

This was 3 minute video explaining a one sentence concept . Not your private key not your bitcoin.

Wheres the wolf of wall street meme?
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:35:50
It's actually the opposite. Credit card purchases (up to a certain limit) are instant and ach purchases have the waiting period.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:20:04
Yes but this applies to any business that earns money. Plenty of people overstate their expenses on tax returns to lower there tax bill .
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:23:28
You can buy with a bank account on coinbase. The bitcoins stay pending for a week but it locks your buy price in at whatever the current rate is.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:32
How could he buy all the bitcoin unless everyone that had bitcoin was willing to sell at the current market price.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:16:54
Stupid post.    Normal currency is inflationary so its actually the opposite. If you hold it, it goes down in value. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:11:12
Love how they called it virtual currency
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:25:25
Please explain your inflationary pyramid schemes where someone that holds the money (with no interest) ends up with more value
@_date: 2019-11-07 20:30:18
Others have done this....

I think what he meant in that broken English was don’t enter your passwords just anywhere.   Like basically be careful where u enter your password.
@_date: 2018-10-14 23:15:04
What are you talking about, bitcoin is not illegal in the us
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:02:51
Well because 10 million dollars can be reprinted. Bitcoin has a known finite supply.

So wait, “pound me too” is the name of their movement. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:40:12
Blockchain does not function without a monetary incentive. There is no blockchain without bitcoin and there is no bitcoin without blockchain. The "big difference" between them is that they are two halves to a whole...
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:47:24
um what? How does batching transactions effect trading volume?
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:19:10
Trading volume does not equal transaction volume
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:23:51
Wow what a retarded response. The revolution of bitcoin has nothing to do with sharing money. Your pulling the analogy of the internet way to far. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:31:35
ouch thats bad
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:26:34
Sounds like you will forever be a no-coiner. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:41:42
I was confused until I read your post which clarified it for me. So thank you for that
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:43:36
FOMO at its finest
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:53:21
THis is the second time you posted this nonsense. That law states what the FDIC is required to keep in the fund. It says nothing about the payout. The payout is 1 to 1.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:34:20
Bitcoin was never exchanged for half a cent . Try again. The earliest trades on exchanges were 5 cents per coin
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:54:00
How does it feel to be a no-coiner?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:11:38
The point is that the funds are insured 100% up to 250000. The only thing Dodd frank act did to this was raise the limit from 100,000

Nice job getting scammed
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:06:52
This here is correct. Credit card companies don't like the fact that you can buy bitcoin with a credit card and immediately turn that bitcoin into cash
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:34:02
All banks in the united states are secured by FDIC insurance up to 250,000. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:28:40
wrong it will get mined..... otherwise how will bitcoin continue to run if the block doesnt get mined?
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:35:12
Buy high and sell low. You're doing it right.
@_date: 2018-11-18 13:57:49
Where is the divergence? Certainly not on the rsi in that chart you just posted.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:50:39
Why are you mining bitcoin with GPUs?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:25:43
The government doesn't force you to be in stocks for a 401k . Wow people on this sub Reddit really are financially retarded. 
Almost every bank offers IRA certificates or savings accounts. It's the companies that force you into their 401k plan if you want there matching percentage. It's not the government .
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:19:53
this was awesome!
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:49:53
Yea why would ANYONE use a peer to peer currency as it was intended.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:08:50
So you regret not buying bitcoin very much by the sounds of it
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:12:04
Who the hell says you can't have debt with bitcoin? Of course you can and isn't that a feature of smart contracts?
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:45:46
No that just states what the fdic is required to hold in the fund. The insurance is 1 to 1 payout. If you had 100k, your payout is 100k. This is assuming the fdic and US government is not collapsing. 
You have to be pretty stupid to think that the payout is only 1%. Are you serious or just trolling
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:56:55
Us early adopters will be rich and the others will be poor.
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:34:38
Hi this was a pretty decent breakdown and easy to read. thanks
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:49:00
No actually you can't. See the senate hearing for why.  There needs to be a Monetary incentive for these huge server farms or what's the point of having them running . If you think someone will just pay them to run there blockchain, then it's no longer decentralized . Bitcoin is blockchain. Blockchain is bitcoin. One doesn't work without the other.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:42:41
Thank you Scott Weiss for buying my coins at 19k

What's the date on this video
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:55:34
Spam transactions dont exist in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:58:14
I see these type of posts and I can't help thinking how stupid it is to pay for in person things with bitcoin. Bitcoin was created to foster peer to peer online transfers. It was never intended for face to face payments and I don't think it will ever be realistic to be used like that. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:34:44
Yea if only we knew 20k was the ceiling.... hindsight is always 20/20...its nowhere near as simple as your trying to make it.
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:11:02
my point now is that you made up some number like 1USD for 200BTC to sound cool when in reality it made you sound like an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:41:49
Well the exchange rate was never $1 for 200 btc ......make up another lie
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:30:30
joke never gets old
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:47:56
And where did you get this great information from
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:58:21
Yea seriously, that argument is laughable at best and delusional at worst.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:55:03
This was such a horrible article. You kept repeating UX is the future but you never once went and explained wtf UX is.
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:38:36
it never went from 5k to 4k. Nice fake story
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:29:45
If you knew the ceiling would be 20k you should be pretty rich right now. But obviously you didn't and your just being a dickhead.
