It can't be far off when you hack a or exit scam from a darknet drug market and 1000's of drug dealers money goes missing. People lost their lives there for sure, how many murders and suicides would there have been? I have no idea but its more than zero.
There will be slightly less when you 'only' take the money from an exchange but again it'll be more than zero I'm sure.

But for a lot of people storing their coins online is the way to avoid all the technical bits. 
If you earn $300 a week and want to store a couple of hundred $ in BTC but have no tech knowledge, dumping them in Coinbase or wherever is probably still a better option than trying to work out wtf a paper wallet is.
Also you can't trade coins in cold storage or on your own laptop.

@_date: 2016-08-05 08:01:09
It seems a bizarre position to take and is surely just inviting further legal disputes.
It has to be one or the other.  If those Bitcoins are in segregated accounts and owned by you, then you've either been hacked and lost the lot or you haven't and are 100% whole.
If the BTC are Bitfinex and they owe you them back, then they're almost certainly insolvent and EVERYONE is going to get a haircut.

@_date: 2016-08-03 08:11:42
I guess it'll depend how the accounts are seen? 
If everyones BTC is their own and Bitfinex is just the custodian of that account, then what?  You could argue the coins in your account that you can see on the block chain are yours, they don't belong to Bitfinex.
I realise this isn't a great comparison, but lets say a car dealership goes bankrupt.  If my car is in there for repairs they can't just sell it and split the money between everyone else.

If you're a trader, you have no choice but to have coins on an exchange. You can't trade them while they're in a laser engraved wallet under your bird bath or on a Trezor in a bank safe.
But with that said, its idiotic to have amounts on exchanges that will 'ruin your life' if lost.

@_date: 2016-08-05 00:48:12


With some of the wording I think they are going to say the Bitcoins were in your own account and you have been hacked, not them.   They had trouble before with coins not being "delivered" and this was a workaround was it not?  So they say the coins have been delivered as they're in 'your' separate account (even if you didn't have access to it).
If they go down this route, anyone who lost BTC is shit out of luck, they eat 100% of the loss. Anyone sitting with fiat, Ether or anything else will be 100% whole. And Bitfinex are solvent and keep trading with zero loss (outside of whatever of their own BTC they lost, no idea if that is significant)

The only way you want a bankruptcy is if you hate the person involved, more than you love the money you lost. 
There isn't a right or wrong answer there but if I lost a thousand or so I'd be happy to see Bitfinex burn and me get nothing.  If I lost 6 figures then theres a lot of shit I'm willing to eat just to get a % of my money back.

How do you see that working?
Do you think you could physically rob a bank, then offer to give back a chunk of the money if they agree not to arrest you? 
It doesn't work that way.
He could have negotiated before hand and said okay I've found a big bug here, give me $x and I'll tell you about it.  You can't simply steal the money in a series of criminal acts, then negotiate your way out of it later.  
The money is gone and he's went down the path of stealing it and hoping he doesn't get caught; he can't change direction now.
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:22:00

Returning 75% of the money doesn't mean he didn't commit a crime in the first place; he's fucked if he gets caught no matter what.
So he may as well keep 100% since he's going to jail if busted no matter what.  
Whats the actual advantage of giving 75% back? As I can't see any.

I think the sooner we all accept that Bitcoins real killer app is doing things either embarrassing (Ashley Madison) or borderline legal (gambling) or actually illegal (buying drugs), the better we'll go.
There is ZERO reason for me to spend Bitcoins in an online store. The bitcoins cost me money to acquire (over and above their value, I had to pay LBC or whoever).  If I spend them I'll need to replace them and again pay.  If I use BTC to buy something I'm giving up my consumer rights.... its madness. 
I own a bar, and I won't be accepting Bitcoin in it. My staff don't have a clue what it is or what its for. And even if they did I'm fighting against the other side too like when I look to spend myself. Its a plain bad deal for the consumer to spend them.

A seller won't want an NDA as once they take ownership of 3000 - 30,000 coins they'll presumably want the price to rise.
The cops won't care about an NDA as its a one off sale of an asset, it doesn't matter to them either way.

Thanks, I certainly won't be leaving money on an exchange for any longer than it takes to carry out the transaction.  The only downside there is if the price crashes to 499 today and I want to buy, by the time my bank wire is received it might be back above a price I'm comfortable buying at :(

"Both sides of a trade will put 20 percent of the value of the contract in escrow -- again in the blockchain.
As the bitcoin price moves in either direction, the blockchain will make a payment from escrow to the other party automatically. No party will be able to remove that collateral."
What do you do when the price swings more than 20% and the other party just walks away from the deal ?
Sounds good in theory but we need Bitcoin to be less volatile, or we need more than 20% down.

I quite like the LBC system, I've bought 10's of thousands of $ worth of coins from it. 
The opportunity to get scammed is relatively low - the window of time that my coins were in the LBC system rather than my own wallet was 20 minutes or so.  You'd need to be extremely unlucky for them to get hacked or go rogue in that time period.  And you can of course split up your sales or purchases into many individual transactions of whatever size you're comfortable with.
I don't accept that Gox was hacked - I think those coins were lost via mismanagement or straight up internal theft.   To me, it just doesn't look like there would be any real incentive for LBC to do similar.  I'm assuming that the full Gox fiasco means not that many people actually keep coins on LBC etc?   So from LBC's point of view there isn't likely to ever be a time when it makes sense to pull the plug and rip everyone.

Bitcoin isn't instant in 99% of real life situations either though is it?  The money might arrive in the recipients wallet near immediately, but its not exactly usable there.

And they wouldn't accept my gas utility bill as the provider sends it electronically. They wanted a scanned copy of a printed version.

I *think* they can run a check against it.  Ie they can put in the number the customer have given them, and it'll flag up if it was incorrect.   They can't just randomly look up your actual phone number. Even if you've submitted your credit card number to them.
They certainly could phone their merchant provider and have them check information.  They might be doing this on a large portion of orders.  If they aren't doing this but are doing something else then its understandable that they don't want to tell us exactly what it is.
They're not stupid... they obviously know the risk of fraudulent orders here is massive.  So if they're not worried about it, I'm not going to either.

I don't understand the hoard mentality.  If you think they're going up in value - thats great.
They'd go up in value even faster if you spent them though.  Spending them encourages other businesses to accept them too... the more places there is to spend them then the more people will be interested in acquiring some.

How can you say other exchanges naturally achieved those prices on their own?
If Gox fraudulently inflated the price to $1000 then of course the other ones were going to be dragged up alongside it.  If they didn't, there would be huge arbitrage opportunities of buying coins everywhere else and selling them on Gox.
The exchanges are all going to be very close to each other in price (assuming of course you can get money in/out of each).  Anything anything of them does to force the price up or down, is going to be mirrored in every other exchange whether they like it or not,

Anyone I know who's techy enough to be interested in (or own) Bitcoins, wouldn't use this service.  We've all got phones we can tether, data plans, USB wifi devices etc.... there is absolutely no way I'd pay Bitcoins to access someone else's wifi.

Tokyo Pen Shop are using Bitcoins as a free advertising avenue.  They're not having to pay merchant fees.  And they're removing my ability to charge back should the pens not arrive, or break in a week or two.
Why would I want to pay for that?  Its the pen shop getting all the benefits, they can pay it.

This full situation is an embarrassment for Bitcoin as a whole.
One of two things needed to happen.
Either Theymos should come out and say the coins were worth $x at the time of donation, so thats how much in Fiat i'm spending regardless of when I spend it.
Or he should come out and say I'm going to legitimately spend the full amount of coins on things promoting Bitcoin and so on.

I wouldn't pay too much attention to Bitcoin users telling you they'd use something, unless they're actually paying you for it right now unfortunately.
Look at the near constant attempts on /bitcoin to tell businesses to accept bit coin when they have no intention of actually using it themselves.... like yesterdays attempt to get people to spam that chinese merchant with 'accept bit coin' support tickets.
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:10:09
I feel that its extremely naive to think merchants accepting BTC is going to lower the price.
If merchants in general don't accept BTC then bitcoin as a concept is dead in the water.  If you can't spend your bitcoins, then they're effectively worthless.
A lot of people spending bitcoins will rebuy them straight away.  I'm a btc holder... but if I can spend any I will and instantly replenish so I'm at the same level.
Even if there is some slight downpricing because of Tiger Direct dumping coins on the market... the fact they're accepting them in the first place and pushing towards them being mainstream more than offsets that.

I think this post was created by someone who is clueless about financial systems. 
The fee on an $82m transfer is irrelevant.  They're going to max out anyway... my own offshore bank would charge me $70 to send that transfer.  A receiving bank may have a fee too but say that'll max out at $70 also.   
Whether you're paying $140 or 4 cents on $84m.... it doesn't matter.
What you should be concentrating on is the fact that that $84m was moved without any oversight or meddling by any third parties.

Then get a better bank, there is no reason to bank somewhere where you need to be physically present to send a wire.

If you want to sell in bulk you'll need to use eBay and Paypal.  Maybe that'll change in the future but for right now today, it is what it is.

If they had ran out of both dollars and bitcoins, then empty gox couldn't take the profits out as they don't actually exist.

If a customer wants to fuck you, they will fuck you. It won't matter if the platform is Amazon or Ebay/Paypal.  The platform is almost always going to side with the buyer.
So to some extent you need to factor these frauds into your business model.  And to some extent you need to plan around them (i.e. holding shipping info for months).
Throwing your toys out the pram and refusing to work via the platforms isn't going to help you. At this point they have such a massive marketshare that most little businesses are going to be forced into using them. Which is why all of the rules they use are so one sided in the first place.

But my point is you can prove you bought the bit coins.  You can't prove a negative, so you cannot prove that you no longer have access to them.
Do you not see a problem if people can do this:
* Rent apartment
* Buy home insurance policy
* Buy $100,000 of Bitcoins
* Burn apartment down
* Claim $100,000 of Bitcoins on insurance
* Some months/years later, move the 'lost' Bitcoins and dispose of them

I would expect you see an immediate increase in donations compared to ad revenue, purely because of this thread.   Then as this thread goes stale, you'll quickly end up getting less donations than ad clicks.  Though I'm speculating as I never actually seen your site before you removed the ads.
With better ad placement (and assuming mostly American, Canadian, UK visitors) you should have been making significantly more than you quoted though.  
I don't see anything wrong with having ads on content - your host isn't free, content creation isn't free, licensing images isn't free, answering support emails.... etc etc etc
imo the only way a bitcoin begging button is going to work long term over traditional advertising, is if the site topic is directly related to bitcoin or crypto.

"Just how much of a trade is lost to slippage is difficult to quantify, according to George Samman, a co-founder of BTC.SX and a former portfolio manager at a New York investment firm. In a hypothetical trade where an investor sold 100 BTC on BitStamp at today’s price of about $490, he or she would stand to lose up to 10% to slippage."
That makes no sense at all. Looking at the Bitstamp order book right now, you'd shift the price 0.2% by buying 100 coins.

We just created an account with Bitstamp today and we had to send documents to be verified.  Verification can be done even if people aren't registering credit cards etc, its just slightly more complicated. It certainly doesn't have to be anonymous if the gambling site owner doesn't want it to be.

It'll also take fewer £ or $ to buy a Macbook in the future.  So the issue isn't inflation or deflation in general, but which purchase method makes more sense today. Since without a Macbook this week I'll be homeless next month when I can't do any work.
Right now I'm not seeing any incentive at all to actually spend Bitcoins, unless given a discount to do so.  I don't even need to make any money, I'm happy to jump through a few hoops of replenishing BTC etc purely to support bitcoin in general. But I'm certainly not going to pay the surcharge myself to do so.

Fair enough.  If someone wants to tip 0.000001 cent and I don't have to see or hear about it then thats fine.   You can't call a penny tip a legitimate tip... its clearly only being done to activate the spam bot so why not kill that off ?  Its just annoying people, and I don't think its productive long term.


Why should I need to pay someone to develop a browser plugin to kill spam, when Reddit could and should kill it off in the first place ?  Thats by far the better solution.   Talking to ChangeTip is pointless... asking them to spam less is going to be like asking Turkeys to vote for Christmas.


They're not doing something they enjoy though.  They're doing something to plaster Bitcoin spam all over the place.   Or if they're genuinely doing it because they enjoy it, then they shouldn't object to there being no public notification at all on that 2 cent tip they just sent.

@_date: 2014-05-25 08:50:47
Don't you see a problem with the "buy bitcoins then instantly spend them" approach when you want to support a bitcoin accepting merchant?
Its not free to acquire bitcoins - the cost being even more if you can't meet Bitstamp etc's KYC and are forced to pay a further tax to acquire through Localbitcoins.  So realistically that Macbook just cost me 5-8% more than if i'd paid by credit card.   Then you add in the fact I also gave up pretty much all my consumer rights and the ability to charge back... its not looking very attractive is it?
Merchants need to offer BTC discounts. Otherwise they're just expecting me as the customer to pay their merchant fees for them, along with lowering their fraudulent chargeback costs to 0%.
Right now, buying with BTC on most merchants is a suckers deal for the customer.  With perhaps the only exception being for early adopters wanting to cash out some coins they've made a profit on, and buying items they'd have bought anyway.

An individual person can't.  If you buy a £1200 laptop and the vat rate is 20%, £200 of that has gone to the government and you can't get it back.
If you're a vat registered business, you charge vat to customers and you can claim it back on expenses.
ie Daves Computers ltd sells 10 laptops for £1200 each and the vat rate is 20%.  So £200 x 10 = £2000 is owed to the tax man. 
For this shop, Dave bought a £120 desk, a £12,000 stock control system and a £120,000 fleet of delivery vans.    So he gets the 20% VAT back on each of these expenses.    £20, £2000 and £20,000 is owed to him.
So he fills in a vat return and its £20 + £2000 + £20,000 - £2,000 = Dave gets a VAT refund of £20,020.  
Of course for most businesses there won't be a VAT refund, they'll actually owe the tax man money.
Numbers above just for simpleness - different countries (or different products within a country) can have different VAT rates.

I'd potentially play but 2 major factors would need to be in place first.
1) owner is doing it to promote bitcoin as the primary purpose, rather than to line his own pockets.  If you're going to sell $1200 of tickets for a $1000 item then that is fine... if you're going to sell way way more than that then its a very poor deal for the buyers and I wouldn't play.
2) needs to have a a draw method that is incorruptible.  Bitcoins and anonymous and so is Facebook.... so I'd have no guarantee that you aren't just awarding prizes to yourself.   It would depend on how many tickets you need to sell I suppose but if it was &lt; 50 you could tie it the bonus ball on the UK national lottery or something.

Most people on a monthly contract will have payments automatically taken each month - this isn't possible with Bitcoin.  
Also how are they going to verify you are who you say you are.  In UK you can get a 'free' iPhone there and then but the cost of it is effectively built into the 24 month contract.  If you pay using bitcoin and then default after a month you're leaving the network eating a £500+ loss.   At the very least you're going to need to let them take the first payment by credit card, and then go to bitcoin.
The truth here is the networks don't want to touch it - they rely on apathy and laziness to keep business. They absolutely don't want you to need to actively pay your bill... they want it to come out without you thinking about it.
Gym's are even worse - they rely on people not only paying every month without thinking about it, but a high % of them never even using the service.  If every gym member tried to turn up weekly you'd never be able to get on any of the equipment.
They certainly don't want you to have to login and pay and think 'hey wait a minute I haven't even been inside the gym since I paid this last...'

If you're running a large business then bank wires would be better for you, especially if you're running on low margins.  You can't risk your payroll bit coins fluctuating and leaving you losing money.
I had 12 Pino employees in the past, before Bitcoin existed. I paid them all by Paypal.  I've just re-hired one this week... I'm going to pay her by Paypal too.  If she wanted I'd certainly consider Rebit, as it sounds ideal for what I'm doing/done (various Pinos, all working from their own home and all needing their own wages directly).  
It just sounds horrible for trying to run a major business though.

" ‘There are hundreds of Bitcoin millionaires out there, and it’s burning a hole in their pocket’"
That doesn't really make any sense.  Its extremely easy to liquidate coins and in huge volumes it can be done 100% safely (i.e. escrow with a real solicitor or something).

The only way you can negotiate is if you give the money back immediately and then say "I deserve x% for doing that" and see what they say.  You're obviously not negotiating from a strong position once the coins are returned, but at least it would be legal.
If you say "I've got all these coins and I'm not giving you them back unless I can keep 20%" its criminal however you look at it.

It doesn't particularly bother me,  I'm just pointing out its making the sub look a bit silly. I go weeks at a time without reading any BTC news, and its looking like the next time I repeat my cycle of being bored/coming back it'll be thats the clear winner anyway.

That makes no sense at all. Bitcoin isn't always going up.

And if the maker agreed with you they'd have done that already. Since the unit cost will be relatively low production wise, and double the market penetration would be brilliant for them at this point.

Its pretty obvious the author of that article is just a kid, or someone with zero real business experience.
You can't on one hand say Bitcoin will take 5% of the gambling market, then on the other list your reasons saying now the companies will be able to avoid KYC and the customers will be able to stay anonymous and avoid potentially paying tax!
Do you think William Hill, Paddy Power, Ladbrokes etc are really going to be able to process Bitcoin transactions under those circumstances?  (3 of the largest online bookmakers in UK).  They are still going to have to do KYC etc, regardless.

Overall, that wouldn't be a brilliant solution. It would kill the spam but it would wipe out a lot of legitimate use of pm's. Maybe someone does an AMA about a medical condition they have, someone else reading it has the same and says hey i'll create an account and pm them something.  Lots of people sign up on a website purely to interact with something or someone they just seen today.
It would be far better to just limit the number of pm's you can send if you have a new account/low karma.  Of course if you use this as your spam fighting tactic you would also need to ensure they couldn't set up accounts in bulk.

Yes but the specific complaints against BTC in relation to crime is that it can be used anonymously, over the internet. 
It opens up a whole new avenue of crimes and quite rightly the police and government are concerned about it. 
You can't buy stolen credit cards from a Russian or heroin from a Turk over the internet, anonymously, with good old fashioned dollars.  You certainly can with BTC. Which is a big part of the reason I'm holding some, may as well ride that wave as it inflates demand.   
The real world uses for BTC are either sketchy, embarrassing or straight up illegal.  We're never going to be paying our rent or groceries with it. The sooner people accept that, the better.

Whats the relevance to Bitcoin? It sounds like an absolutely awful fit here.
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:01:12
Because you can only ever get the purchase price back, and there would be some risk to carrying out the scam multiple times if you used your own credit card to pay for it.
With crypto there could be opportunities to get multiples of your original price back. Look how quickly Ethereum rose this year, look how quickly Monero rose this week. 
Even if Bitcoin "only" goes up 25% this week, thats a temptation for an otherwise honest person to break their item and get a huge chunk of free cash out of the deal...

Price of Bitcoin today is $500.  You buy an expensive TV for $2000, receipt shows 4 BTC only.   You had 10 BTC to start with worth $5000, now you have 6 BTC and a TV. You spend $2000 replacing the BTC, now you have 10 BTC and a TV.
Next month something happens that the price of BTC goes up to $1000. Price of TV in store drops to two BTC.
How many people do you think in this hypothetical scenario, are now going to experience mysterious faults in the TV that require it to be returned, for a 4 BTC refund?  As you could now break the TV and return it for 4 BTC, then walk up the street and buy another for 2 BTC and pocket the difference.
What you are proposing is ridiculous, sorry. Its completely unworkable.

So make it easy for me to spend coins then.
Right now you're asking me to give up all my consumer protection rights (ability to dispute transactions or charge back) and in return you're going to charge me a more expensive price (since I need to pay a market fee to acquire the coins). 
What you're asking here is madness; it needs to make sense from the consumer point of view.  The obvious way to do that would be a discount of &gt; typical exchange fees.

Amazon will just eat a huge amount of fraud costs as part of doing business as pretty much the biggest merchant online.
Just because you seen no ill effects from those 30 purchases, it doesn't mean they were all done legitimately. 


Because Allison used to live in the US, she still had a bank account where Amazon deposits her earnings. However, both her US and Indonesian banks charged her fees to send and receive. Fed up with bank fees and delays, she started moving her her businesses to bitcoin.
To convert her affiliate revenue, she’s accepting Amazon gift cards as payment and purchasing items on Purse. She’s now living in paradise happily earning bitcoins.
Yes, I'm sure thats a normal scenario for someone on purse, haha.

If you want to factor in inflation, I think a lot of people should also factor in "I'll waste that money".  
I gave my 14 year old brother a bitcoin about a year ago. Its now made money I assume (can't remember the exact dates), and he still owns it (since I kept it on my Trezor).   
Even if it was 20% down today he'd realistically be up in real terms as he'd probably have wasted the money at the time if given cash...

No problems whatsoever.  But I have a fair amount of money flowing through my accounts and it is all earned legitimately and came in from bank transfers etc.

Or how about people buy expensive cars because they enjoy them, and can actually afford the depreciation, and don't care about the running costs?
I'd rather have my hobby (driving nice cars) than yours (playing DoTA online) but I'm not going to call yours dumb.

Not sure whether insane or trolling.

But you were talking about getting paid in BTC.  For anyone actually going to a workplace it would be a trivial matter to see exactly where they work and force the employer to disclose how much you were paid and were it went to.

So only eat bagels and no mention of rent etc?  
Thats not exactly a realistic scenario is it.

Not brilliant so far, lost a little.  If I had no confidence in the bet I could change it all back in minutes on Shapeshift but I am going to let it play out for now.

They won't matter.  He was arrested in Poland.

That car dealership thing you're linking to (Eggify) has already closed down. Plus it was just a publicity stunt anyway. At no point have you really been able to buy a Lambo with Bitcoin. You have been able to cash out that days exchange rate worth of Bitcoins, so that Fiat landed in the dealers bank account.  You can do this at absolutely any dealership worldwide, today.

We knew that from the part where he accepted Bitcoin at his food truck.  Utterly pointless.  I own a bar and sell similar priced items to a similar general public and even as a crypto holder there is zero chance of me accepting it for payments.
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:00:40


No we can't as you just repeatedly make vague statements about having loads of BTC.
Why not just tell us, how many do you actually have?
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:49:35
How much actual Fiat money did you put in in the first place to trade with?

The comparison is dumb &amp; childish.
Selling knives is completely legal and 99.99999% of the buyers don't cause misery for others with them.
Selling crack cocaine is a crime in itself and a huge % of their users are robbing and stealing to pay for them.  
Its idiotic to compare selling both.

what do you drive?  As this post makes you look like a jealous idiot.

It very well could be if it was done in a controlled manner.
I don't know about anywhere else but the vast majority of low level acquisition crimes (i.e. street robberies, burglary of homes etc) are all carried out by drug addicts.
I'd quite happily legalise it and give it away free but under strict supervision from a doctor.  That would cut crime massively overnight. If the flip side of that is some drug addicts ending up killing themselves of their own free choice... I think thats a fair trade off for society.

Ross was running the operation, he was basically complicit in every single drug deal that took place there.  So of course it makes sense that he got the harshest penalty.
You are also not taking into account that Slomp pled guilty, and cooperated against other people - of course he was going to get a far lighter sentence than that.   Ross went to trial and presumably couldn't really roll on anyone as he was at the top of the chain.  
The sentences seem fair to me? Though without knowing to what extent Slomp cooperated, its impossible to say for sure.

When you're resorting to arguments like that you've completely lost all credibility.

Had 100, sold them all for Ethereum instead.

I've always just assumed anyone tech savvy enough to use Bitcoin, is tech savvy enough to not be paying for porn.

But if the price drops 13% in the time it takes for me to deal with being able to withdraw it, perhaps I'd rather have not sold the car at all. And if I sold my house and that happened I might not actually be able to repay the loans still held against it.
If you want businesses to accept BTC you need price stability similar to what we see between USD, EUR, GBP

I have a 'real' job along with a hobby that time wise has effectively become a full time job of its own (stray dog rescue).  So I don't follow Bitcoin very closely, just check in every now and then to see whats going on.  A friend mentioned the price rising this week and here I am reading Reddit over the last few days. 
Also at 100 coins / $50k I was thinking thats about as much as I want to gamble on something I don't know very much about.  At $200 I'd have had no idea if I was throwing more good money after bad, as I hadn't been following the price or the news and had no idea why it had halved.
