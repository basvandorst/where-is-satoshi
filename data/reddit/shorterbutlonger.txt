Is there no way of me getting my money back?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:50:21
I’m trying to contact COINBASE

Thank you. I appreciate your help. Contacts of mine are mad adding 10s of thousands to their accounts when a company allowing them to do it cannot supply enough staff to reply to an email

Yes bitcoin.com

Couldn’t agree more. I made an error. COINBASE have my money and provide no way of contacting them other than email. This then replies with automated responses

Their app and website when I fail to log in offer no option to contact them by phone. They offer my email however they are not replying to any questions asked

It seems more CoinBase. But I’ll stick to stocks and shares from now on

I’m an innocent person extremely hacked off with them making me unable to withdraw my own money

I paid money into a coin base account buying 3 different “investments” one being bitcoin. I did this when in Asia earlier this year. They then made it extremely hard work to get into my account without using my SimCard used in Asia. Eventually I got in to my account. I sold all my “investments” leaving me a figure in account held on their COINBASE app. They instructed me to send 5 euros (at a cost of £9.50) to ESTONIA. When this money arrived they emailed me advising my account has now been authorised and can withdraw. When clicking the withdraw button it advised me to send money to ESTONIA. I decided to log out and back in to see if this would correct the withdrawal. It then advises it will text my auth code to my Asia sim. I’m not it Asia and cannot use that sim. So I cannot even get in to my account now
