This is the right kind of attitude to have, It's not nice to assume that whoever is mentioning 'bit' is such a dick with their use of language that they'd use this proposed unit name. Maybe they do mean transaction data size in bits or something else.

So, to depict 100 satoshis you draw 30 dots. And to depict 1 million of something else you draw 40 pictures of a video game currency. And to depict 100 million satoshis you draw 480 dots.
Wow. Much genius. Such rational.
Do you guys at walepool.io (the advertisement in the lower right corner of the image) really want exchanges to start accounting your deposits in units of information and to one day end up with nothing but information recorded on their servers (as happened on Mt. Gox, and partially on Bitfinex)? Or are you actually representing an exchange or some other entity with large BTC liabilities?
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:27:48
Someone who has BTC liabilities, but especially someone like Bitfinex, who AFAIK still need to come up with tens of thousands of bitcoins to make their customers whole, would love to only owe bits of information, rather than bitcoins. But this guy is flibbr, a trader from walepool.io (there's an advertisement for it in the lower right corner of the image). Who knows what trade he has going that prompted him to appeal to emotions like this. It's odd that he wouldn't conceal his identity this time, though.

Apparently that's 18 595 BTC, or more like USD 5 million worth. I totally see how it's confusing (it took me a while too). Blame the bitfags for their idea of using the name of a unit of information for a new monetary unit. And as can be seen here it's an impractical one at that.

It's possible to safely split the coins via a non SegWit transaction on the SegWit chain. Otherwise, yeah, SegWit transactions which are also valid on the other chain will likely be appropriated/stolen by miners - like an extra subsidy to keep miners mining the chain which does not support SegWit!
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:57:57
If this is now company policy at BitGo this is huge. BitGo customers should be warned that if the currency splits due to UASF, the company probably intends to only honor SegWit-coin obligations, and not the original chain's coin obligations! The UASF proposal calls for companies to basically ignore and suppress the original coin! And this is what BitGo seems to be supporting here! And if the UASF chain merely fizzles and BitGo is forced to revert to the original chain, they could suffer reversed transactions and double spends!
If I had any business with BitGo I would make my Bitcoins GO out of BitGo by yesterday, if possible. This is madness. Basically like a bank announcing its intention to replace customers' dollar balances with a new asset, worth strictly less than a dollar per unit. The bank doesn't say what they intend to do with the rest - pocket it or leave it to any taker. But in any case, the bank unilaterally waives the liability towards customers.
BTCC has already suspended withdrawals, so it may be too late for their customers.

If Coinbase refused to honor their obligation to their customers and give them access to their coins on the non SegWit chain, they'd lose all their customers who care about money at all, before the fork even happened. What company would do such a suicidal announcement?
@_date: 2017-04-07 20:44:48
Why do you keep bringing up node counts when I say nothing of this but I do bring attention to the fact of substituting the coin?
BitGo is supposedly supporting UASF now. If I had any business with BitGo I would make my Bitcoins GO out of BitGo by yesterday, if possible. This is madness.

With only ~10% (BIP 148's support, comprising of BitFury), ~36% (SegWit) or even 50% of miners enforcing the new rules there's guaranteed disruption. BIP 8 doesn't make this any better. In BIP 8, as in BIP 148 by the same author, there's no attempt at actually measuring what the users or the economy (not to mention miners) wants.


What you say is more true about users and the economy. It's easier to sell BTC than sell mining hardware and know-how. But when miners start enforcing new rules, and users start using the new rules, it's hard for them to reverse their decision (strictly removing the new rules would be a hard fork, which would be bad for them when users don't follow).
We can't just ignore a veto that miners want to give. As you are saying, miners are ephemeral to an extent, so the veto likely won't be forever. Why don't we just wait? Why not have some patience? We can get the SegWit features with miner support eventually, avoiding the risk of disruption.

Someone will inevitably mine a block invalid according to the proposed new rules, which will split the blockchain. Then unmodified old miners will not be mining on the chain which enforces the new rules. Same disruption. This has to be considered in the design of a soft fork.


I understand. A miner in violation of new rules could still be observing old rules. So it comes down to whether the proposed new rules are considered part of Bitcoin or not. It's about who has the right to carry the name "Bitcoin" and the ticker symbol "BTC" - the chain with unchanged rules, or the one with new rules. I don't think it's a good idea to force everyone involved with Bitcoin to choose, over SegWit. These new rules are not some emergency fix for some critical vulnerability which was itself about to imminently split the blockchain, or do something even worse. So it's not a trivial choice. It doesn't have to be forced.

You are totally ignoring/contradicting your own UASF propaganda bullshit, which is being destroyed by No wonder you are confused, or playing dumb. What he says means that BIP 148/BIP 8 have no merit.

I actually want miners to signal for and activate SegWit and don't like the block size hard forks promoted there. I don't like any contentious forks.

The whole UASF craze that started with shaolinfry's recent posts, including BIP 148 and BIP 8, was never about safety. It was all about getting multiple coins and big fights, from the start. Save yourself the trouble and assume everything that comes in this campaign is designed to divide people, break consensus, spread technical disinformation, confuse people, etc.

I can't take this as just a joke. You think this is funny? We are all wondering who is organizing the BIP 148 campaign for splitting Bitcoin. And you are hinting at Blockstream. It's not the first clue connecting them to that campaign. I hope Blockstream comes forward with an official stance.

@_date: 2017-05-08 15:22:08
Hey, Blockstream HR/finance department!! I found that several of your employees support a campaign to fork Bitcoin and abandon the original BTC token in favor of SegWit-coin. It's called BIP 148/BIP 8 a.k.a. UASF. They specifically call for exchanges to only trade the new coin and NOT the original BTC. So, why don't you make these employees a favor and promise to only pay them in SegWit-coin, when it is available!? You'll split your coins and save your original BTC portion for other things. You'll only owe them the coin which they promote (call it SegWit-coin). Whatever the BTC portion is worth, it's just gain for you. You could even pocket it personally, if no one asks for it. Think about this. Consider this seriously. You'll also learn to love UASF, because you could gain from it, even though it sucks for Bitcoin.
a BTC hodler.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:25:43
They want to manipulate the markets. They want to deny people access to some or all of their money. They say so openly - they want exchanges NOT to trade the coins from the original Bitcoin's chain. They don't want people to see how markets price their shitcoin compared to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:56:05
I'm not surprised at all, not even by your bold opinion of yourself. However, do note the important consequences of the hypothesis that you are sane. If it is so, then it would remove one explanation, and possible defense, of your vocal public support for campaigns to split Bitcoin, such as BIP 148. If you are sane, then you would be considered completely responsible for these actions. You will be held accountable for all your words.
**I see that now the rivalry between supporters of different campaigns to split the blockchain is intensifying**. It was only a matter of time before the supporters of the hard fork proposal who are active on that forum turned against you, as a prominent supporter of the chain split proposal I mentioned above, which is being protected on this forum.
This is simple competition. And this is how turf gets divided between competing gangs. The gangs are competing for potential victims of pump and dumps and other similar schemes. I can only hope that fraudsters expend a lot of resources fighting each other and in doing so make them more easily identifiable and weaker, thus easier to avoid by potential victims. Our community needs to overcome and build immunity to the fraud which is commonplace.

Very significant words. My impression is that this position is the norm among the members of the current UASF campaign. This is not an exception. Most of you are that extreme.
With this in mind, it will be no surprise to see not just threats but outright counterattacks against you, which your BIPs provide many opportunities for. You will get rekt. I'm just making a prediction here.

**TL;DW**: An obnoxious incredibly irritating and loud sound, followed by an interesting interview that you would want to hear, but with the audio volume going down gradually, prompting you to increase the volume, followed by the same sound from the beginning, at the same volume level as in the beginning (but now your volume settings are up, too).
Hang whoever is responsible for the audio. Scratch that. **I hope you get tazed to death!**

Sure, I recognize that, even though it came after a delay. He once said something to the effect of "you make me want to read about BIP 148 so that I can support it". Well, he read it, and rejected it, as should be expected. Then he made the same mistake again of [commenting prematurely about the next meritless UASF version](




And the UASF supporters advertise his words as sign of support. But I don't have him in mind as a supporter of these particular contentious forks.
SegWit itself is good, so supporting that is, of course, to be expected.

It's entirely understandable that you don't know what BIP 148 and BIP 8 do, since they have no merit and deserve no attention. Just to clear the misunderstanding, they split the blockchain and thus create two separate tokens, very similar to what contentious hard forks do.
I assume Blockstream employees understand these things.
