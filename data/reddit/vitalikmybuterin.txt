Great call on Ethereum .. who wants 200% gains s/ Do your homework.. it comes back to btc on profits but nothing wrong trading into a bull market.
BUT btc has some issues it needs to address which is way more important than alts and global macro economics .. if you get house in order fundamentals will take care of price
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:52:26
Once market cap of crypto hits trillions prices will be much more stable.. boring as shit by then though.. will be cheers for 10% gains like the shitty stock market that the pros get now

I think there was an inflated demand though over last week. doesnt mean price drop though (due to fiat/new $$ coming in).  If BCC is successful grabbing market share and Alts take a run no question BTC will dip. if BCC not successful (limps along for next 48hrs) and Alts hold or dip I think well see huge run. Im betting (albeit small bet) on the former as I think there is enough incentive to support BCC at least short term... time will tell. FUN TIMES!

I like it.. if they said nakamoto id say your onto something!
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:08:26
Yes another reason this is complex and hard to predict imo
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:01:45
a ton of people bought btc to get the "free coins". Many of those will now sell BTC to re-establish their portfolios.. many will hold for potential upside. Many of those will sell their new BCC coins for more BTC and Alts. Some may sell BTC for BCC. ... plus other scenarios means its not as simple as saying 10% drop if BCC takes 10% MC.. many moving parts
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:02:04
I'm buying.. after the dump though.. there will be minimum 20% not dumped.. do the math
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:06:15
I think altcoins pegged to btc is huge huge advantage.. don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.. I don't follow how pumpers are interfering with bitcoin progress?? Seems to me it needs to stand on its own or something's wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:35:49
I think your bang on (minus market irrationality)

Check out enjin .. tell me what you think. I'm older and not a gamer but think this is very good one for someone in your shoes.. btc is a nice foundation tho and safer play

smart as  but you'd be snarky too if you got beat up on the playground your whole childhood...  
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:15:31
Seriously buddy.. a world without altcoins sucks.. it's just tricky to sort out shitcoin from the real deal at times .. gotta take the good with the bad. But if you think crypto is better off with a bitcoin only your completely wrong imo
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:12:59
Be nice if it worked.. trying to buy some shit and no bitcoin option.. PayPal or visa only.. brutal
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:11:34
I guess I don't see it as trying to derail its different opinion what future looks like for btc .. unfortunate as controversy and hard forks don't mix well. Bottom line though and beauty of blockchain is the users will win in the long run and use the chain that suits them the best
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:21:13
Good luck and stay safe out there!! 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:51:31
I see alt coins rising with btc ... don't agree with your logic but to each their own. I want sound tech period and price whether alt or btc will follow... if tech sucks it will eventually be priced accordingly. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:46:29
It's good to see people holding projects to task ... I'm not selling yet but looking at closer .. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:42:15
No potential for total loss ... zero chance unless your referring to an apocalypse .. blockchain is here to stay. Educate yourself. Not saying bitcoin specifically is not going to go on dramatic swings., it no doubt will but the concept of decentralization with NO way for governments or totalitarians to shut it down cannot be defeated... good luck to you

@_date: 2017-09-05 12:47:03
Yes your missing something imo.
Any ban ico or not creates FUD.. short term decline expected here. 
Must icos people used ether vs btc.. if anything this can cause less demand short term for both though. Not positive for price. 
All short term imo and where your correct is btc more attractive since it is not intimately connected to icos and is less risk ATM.
Also price isn't really "tanking" .. bit of a pullback

It's such a cop out perspective.. of course things crash after pumps .. it's basic market behaviour. You can't be wrong with that analysis.. watch within 10 years we'll have a bubble burst and the market will go down 100%.. bubble burst!! Whatever...
