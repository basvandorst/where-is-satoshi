A longer drawn out roll in the rear of the thunder clap for very large transaction woul dbe nice, in australia a single lighting strike can produce thunder that keeps rolling for 10+ seconds. This is another way to create difference in representation for different sized tranactions.

Property rights. If someone wants to frack on thier land they can do so. If someone can proove that fracking from property A caused destruction of value on property B then it is a violation of property rights and goes to court.
You also cannot throw out nonsense like "you can't have anarchy if more than 50% of the population is against it." without a coherent thought to back it up.
It is not up to you to decide if I can frack or not, I would never forced you not to do a peaceful activity so do not dare think you have to right to tell me what to do.

Yes, people will agree on law and that law will be carried out. I don't see a problem at all. If you have a lack of creativity to see how this problem may be solved without government that is not a reason to say it cannot be solved.

I have wholly answered your first question already i will not continue that thread of conversation.
Finally you admit to being willing to use force via government to control the behaviour of other people, the sad part is you would not have the courage to come to my doorstep and take "taxes" in person, instead you have men in blue costumes enforce your restrictions on my liberties and facilitate the theft that is taxes. 
I would never do the same to you, i would never force you give me any of your property and i would never restrict any peaceful action you wished to perform.
If you beleive it is right for people in a special building writing on special papers to degree what you can and cannot do you are free to be controlled by them, do not drag me into the slave pit with you.
I reject you and anyone else who would seek to force me against my will to do something i don't want to do.

Ban bitcoins
Responsible department: Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Bitcoins are used by hackers and other people trying to evade the law (child pornographers, terrorists, etc.)
Therefore they should be made illegal.
Im never surprised anymore by the ridiculousness of government arguments. My  reason for supporting Bitcoin is to see tyranny burn.

Technically citizens who support the use of government force against other citizens are part of the government, this is horizontal oppression.

If only all producers, suppliers, retailers and consumers switched over to BTC overnight, then businessess could keep them as thier main currency.

You make many critical errors.
I never joined a collective, i never signed a social contract and i reject all use of force in society, within that rejection is government.
I as a free independant human being am not subject to any arbitrary "requirements" set out by any individual or any group.
You assume that competition is a negative thing the orwellian nature of your comment disturbes me greatly, there is no greater force for progress in technology and efficiency than competition simply look at the relatively regulation free markets in IT, mobile phones and telecommunications.
If it is important for the government to remove competition in basic utilities would you support 100% socialised food production?, after all food is far more important than basic utilities. Please tell me how socialised food production has worked in the past?
Once again i do not owe a damn thing to any person or any collective, i did not ask for anything in return either. These "wonderful benefits" you speak of were funded by way of taxation, which is a fancy word for theft in its essence. A taxpayer whether willing or unwilling has no choice and MUST hand over a share of his/her income to the local warlord in order to avoid being thrown in prison. This is how taxation is backed up by the use of force.
 I have a question for you, would you personally come to my doorstep and demand a share of my income to pay for your social programs? If i said no, what would you personally do?

Market forces particularly the price mechanism are/is the only necessary vehicle in which to conserve and direct resources. For further reading please see "economics in one lesson" by Henry Hazlitt.
Essectially as we near scarcity of a resource the price will increase to signify its depleted state and thus demand will decrease to meet supply giving space and motivation for new technologies such as the transition from horse drawn to motor vehicles. From Coal to gas and then hopefully to nuclear.

How about the moral argument that that money is the property of that man and that no person obviously including any person wearing a uniform has the right to take it from him without his consent.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:51:18
The government derives its power from the people, without thier consent the system doesnt stand, i understand what im saying isnt very scientific and lacks empirical evidence yet i nevertheless stand by it. The people give tacit consent and intellectual support by supporting government positions and the use of government force, they provide the environment for the government to operate in a perceived legitimate way.

I care about it being a monopoly for the reason i already stated, i am FORCED against my will to pay into these systems via taxes to support them, that is the definition of theft. Just because the mafia gives my property "protection" when i hand over my 10% does not justify the taking of my 10% "or we will break your knee caps" =/= "or we will throw you in jail".
Not only am i mugged to pay for the system if say i wanted to start a company that provided piped water to household, or build my own road or create some entrepreneurial asset that competes with a government protected or created monopoly, i will be thrown in a rape cage. The government restricts my natural born right to do with my resources as i see fit, it also restricts me from paying anyone else to provide a competing service for me. Even if it was not illegal to provide such services early startups would be crushed competitavely by the taxpayer backed monopoly, such organisations do not need to turn profits and have a massive tax base to fall back on, private enterprise doesnt have such luxuries.
The least important of my reasons yet the one that effects me personally the most is the quality of service provided by government monopolies particularly the rail and road netwrok in my home city. Oh how i yearn to see freedom reign in transport, to end the incompetence and absolutely atrocious beyond beleif quality that is served up to me and forced down my throat on a daily basis. The sad part is when the people around you eat shit daily with no knowledge of any other form of food, they happily scoff it down dragging me with them.

These are all restrictions on my natural born rights. I as an individual own myself and the results of what my body time and resources produce, noone else lays claim to my property but myself, any restriction on how i wish to peacefully use my property is a violation of my right to self ownership. To suggest anything less than self-ownership is to be a slave at the whim of a different entity. This is a moral evil that i seek to abolish.
Do you agree or disagree?

Want? you missunderstand. These rights are inalienable, they are intrinsic to my existence, they are not given to me by any person and noone can take them away they can only violate them.
The point is if i tried to peacefully run a private trade in lets use your example of plumbing then i would be thrown in jail for introducing competition to the government backed monopoly market. I care because it is a restriction on my personal liberties.
I have answered your questions now answer mine, Is the use of force (esspecially by government) against me in such a way that violates my self ownership moral or immoral?
