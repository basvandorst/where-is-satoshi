In my very naive opinion, Bitcoin trading is purely technical analysis cause theres no business model like stocks and bonds. I tried trading and predicted right a few times but still loses because lack of trading strategy and risk management. 
Its also more intense than normal trading because its traded 24/7, and the starting hours of another market (9am in Asia for example) can make different price movements.

You can buy Bitcoin with a job ? It doesnt matter what currency if you get paid cents for temporary gigs. You're still gonna be broke

'What happened will happen again' is how people lose money.

This is called 'shorting'. If it is interest than you paid x% of the original 0.04 in BTC, regardless of the BTC to USD exchange rate.

I agree. People be like "omg btc 100k fuck fiat fuck banks", but the road to 100k will have ups and downs. If you want to trade everyday, good luck thinking that btc will go up everyday. Understand that there are smarter people and smarter bots that will gladly take your money. Otherwise sit back, relax and hodl.

Well his behavior is perfectly normal. "It had this stellar growth, but is it too high now ?" is a perfectly normal question when you invest.
