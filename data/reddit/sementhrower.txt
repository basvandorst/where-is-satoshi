You can claim SBTC and Diamond using an app called Bither - super easy 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:24:50
I just did it with a normal private key an hour ago, works perfectly fine
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:45:56
Are you sure your app is updated?
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:40:16
There's an app called Bither that can do it for you.

You're right. I would hate that knife so much if I had it
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:32:28
because the transaction is huge: 9797 bytes. 40.87satoshi/byte is way too low.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:32:49
Holy shit...that's a 3 million dollar knife
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:12:32
he probably started using faucets before the price of btc skyrocketed. When bitcoins were worth $1 each, some faucets were giving out 0.01BTC at a time.
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:59:59
it would die out/come to a halt. Bitcoins ultimately rely on the internet to possess value. If the internet is gone/unavailable to people, we won't be able to access it, thus giving it next to no monetary value. 
Think of it this way: you possess 20 bars of gold, but all of them have fallen into the middle of the pacific ocean for some weird buttfuck reason. You know exactly where it is, but no one on the planet has ships/planes to get there. TECHNICALLY you still possess the gold, but you don't have access to it.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:59:39
Keep your job. Honestly, bitcoins are still extremely volatile...prices can fluctuate up and down dramatically over the course of a single day.
You will always need a steady, **reliable** income. Keep mining, but your job is still important.

The serif-font for the public address does not go well with the design theme of the card. Try experimenting with a few sans-serif fonts for the address.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:57:17
love you too
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:49:52
It's really likely that this shelter has never even heard of bitcoin. Bitcoin adoption really isn't as widespread as you think it is. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:42:24
Wow. 
Wow. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 02:21:25
 sells bitcoins for paypal. Pretty expensive, but it's relatively quick (~2 hours for BTC to appear in my account). Only use it if you have no other options.
@_date: 2013-04-26 03:49:09
thank you!
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:19:40
looks promising! I'll check it out as soon as I get the wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:40:49
It's to overcome people's psychological barrier of feeling the need to own one *whole* bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:10:26
Oh, sorry! I assumed so because of how much he claimed he made. Read again, I think he's only an investor!
Regardless, my point remains, bitcoins are cool as fuck, but shouldn't be what you depend all your financials on. Not for now, at least.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:08:47
Does this really require a meme format? Seriously? God I thought I was on @_date: 2013-11-26 21:38:15
Ugh, another shitpost
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:59:54
I'm not the one who downvoted you! I love my fellow bitcoiners. Absolutely hate the obsession with image macros though.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:03:32
wow! I'd love to donate as much, but don't have enough BTC :( hoping my 0.05 would suffice!
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:01:29
Honestly how did this thing even get upvoted? The subreddit is becoming more and more of a circlejerk every day. Please, more news on adoption and legislation, less image macros and to the moon celebrations.

I've paid via paypal for 0.1BTC. How long does it usually take to get my voucher code?
@_date: 2013-05-04 01:05:34
wow. you did it.

Honestly the shittiest argument you can ever give for product validation. 
"hey guys I'm selling this diamond ring for $6000! Oh wow this just in you also get a beanie baby for free! If this diamond turns out fake at least you have a beanie baby!"
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:16:01
If overcoming this barrier will allow faster bitcoin adoption, I'm all for it. It's honestly a bit easier to calculate, too. At the moment, 1mBTC is approx. $1. It's nice and simple for the time being, but it probably won't last for too long.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:07:30
I know this isn't answering your question, but I seriously don't recommend brain wallets. If you're thinking of a permanent and safe way to store your btc, cold storage is your best bet. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:14:25
Mind sharing the PSD file for this?
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:08:25
Wow, this is tempting. Just gotta find a way to get another 1198 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:51:08
For the past week, it's amazing waking up in the morning every day just to see at least a $50 price increase per bitcoin. The growth of the value of bitcoin and its adoption rate is absolutely incredible.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:32:27
No, and it shouldn't be one. The point is that a market worth $12B shouldn't be developed and supported by only a few people. It's just too inefficient for the amount of work constantly needed to be done.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:14:25
Nope. It won't just go on infinitely. Its value will drop when people see less value in it. Supply and demand. The supply is consistent, the demand is not. Prices will drop when a lot of people panic sell, exchanging their finances from btc to fiat.
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:40:03
Might wanna remove your public address in the post. It's discouraged to do so in this subreddit. If people really wanna send you BTC, they'd do so through the bitcointip bot.
@_date: 2013-04-28 05:20:03
You're next in line 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:08:27
Even the best math mathematicians won't be able to completely predict the market, even more so for a currency as volatile as btc. No one can really guarantee that the price won't drop $100 in the next 10 minutes, and no one can guarantee it will go up by $100.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:27:57
The Boston Celtics...they're, um, no.

I'm willing to offer 0.1BTC for the purchase of the state of Zimbabwe. I am to become the President, and I get to keep the presidential building and all the elephants in the country.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:31:50
The description of how transactions work is done really well in the video. When I first got into bitcoin, it took me a whole week to wrap around how BTC is transferred between addresses. The more I think about it, the cooler it is. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:48:17
wow. you're a terrible person
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:48:09
How fucking idiotic do you have to be to expect someone to just give you 1btc for a goddamn upvote? 
Circlejerk is all satire, and by posting your address and begging like little shits you're just enforcing the stereotype. Ugh. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:18:18
Yup, you're right!
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:53:52
Well, kind of
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:37:36
how hypocritically hypocritical of him
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:23:02
I'm not being sarcastic, don't worry :)
The optimism in this subreddit is honestly really unhealthy. "Next year it will be worth 10k" "Next year I can buy a house with 1 bitcoin". They fail to put into account that bitcoin is an investment, and a very risky one at that. Just because its value is rising doesn't mean it won't drop the next second. Fuck the whole to the moon thing.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:56:02
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:30:40
MUCH BETTER. The address is no longer out of place.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:52:51
oh hey I too think you're educated
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:41:08
instead of writing "5 bitcents", write "B0.05". Also, since you already are replying to OP, there's no need to add his name.
The proper format would be "+bitcointip B0.05 verify"

I mod and restrict all posts to self posts exclusively. I understand that it'll be more difficult here because of the many articles submitted, but even putting the link in the text will work.
Self posts in general just discourage image macros, I've noticed. Implemented the switch 1 month ago. Zero complaints and zero image macros submitted.

While it's a cool concept, the bitcoins will still take time to be confirmed, etc. It will be much more time consuming than just putting in bills and coins. However, it's another step toward BTC replacing fiat money, which is awesome!
