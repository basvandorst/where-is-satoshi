Considering that anything other than large transfers in Bitcoin is now unfeasible, there should be enough incentive for LN, both in terms of cost and speed of transactions.

Exchanges might not have a need per se, but their customers do, and so there should be competitive pressures to adopt it.
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:15:45
Not when you consider it's about to be replaced by Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:41:55
I'm not disputing that you *technically* can buy coffee with Bitcoin. You, or anyone else, just won't do it, because it makes zero sense to pay fees that are higher than the cost of whatever you're purchasing, such as a cup of coffee.
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:17:02
ffs, hold your own Bitcoin, don't trust a third party.

If most of the Core nodes were compiled with `assert` enabled, this bug wouldn't spread, as the affected nodes would crash thus fail to relay the transaction.
If most of the Core nodes were compiled with `assert` disabled, this bug would have lead to actual double spends (aka inflation), which would have been very bad indeed, but wouldn't have "brought down the entire network".

Argument from incredulity.

What others have said is correct, but even if not, the set of valid hashes only gets smaller, so if a hash isn't valid today, it'll never be valid. This of course assumes an ever increasing hashrate, which is what we've seen so far, but may not last forever.
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:14:04
I'm not stating any personal opinion here. Taxation is only necessary, if my claim is even valid, if one believes the military itself is necessary. Anyone who doesn't believe the military is necessary, wouldn't need to support taxation.
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:18:26
"up to"

Police services could be paid for through an insurance scheme that would also cover investigations.
Private schools are mostly cheaper than public schools. Poor families could probably get tuition paid by the school, like it often happens today.
Roads could easily be paid for by usage fees.
Military (US) is excessively large and expensive, but probably do need taxes, since no one in their right mind wants to voluntarily pay for killing innocent civilians and starting wars all over the world.

Considering the falling BTC/BCH ratio, they've likely already begun.
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:03:08
In *some* parts of the world. Us that are privileged often forget that.
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:11:12
*your* conclusion.
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:33:36
Ok, bad inference. Anyway, here you go:
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:12:07
You seem to assume a lot. It's not really working. You made an assertion. I think by now it's been refuted as being conditional.
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:09:10
Just because you say so, doesn't make it so.
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:34:34
Taxes are not necessary. In fact, most of human existence has been without taxes.
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:58:49
What's a left-wing country? Venezuela? Cuba? North Korea? Madagascar? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:34:39
Lol, sure thing. Your overly emotional style is kind of funny, and reveals that you of course are German, hurt feelings and all.
Whatever, I'm done with this pointless exercise.
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:33:01
Pretty sure they don't support LN.

Bitmain doesn't have 51%.

87, and he will surely work until he dies.
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:20:59
Depends on what is meant by "dental". I mean, surely not for a cleaning.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:10:46
And now your argument has devolved into ad hominem.
Look, I'm not taking a position here, just pointing out that your logic is flawed, and your goals not as universal as you seem to think.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:11:01
I'm not sure who "we" are that you're referring to. 
Regardless, those things you mention could be provided by non-government entities or through fee based funding.
@_date: 2018-05-05 15:14:02
One could argue the death penalty the same way.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:29:50
I seriously doubt Judas sold any BTC. He's claimed various contradictory things, but could have been smart enough to just keep his holdings separate.
Bitmain however did, which tells you the degree to which they believed they could control the market.
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:41:09
That's great. I didn't see it anywhere. Do you have a link?
@_date: 2018-05-04 22:29:50
Again, you're making assertions to support your position. Someone to whom poverty reduction isn't a goal, or doesn't believe income redistribution works, or simply feels it's a bad trade-off, your argument that taxes are *necessary* is unconvincing.
@_date: 2018-05-09 12:05:57
Germany is used, by the other European countries, as an example of a country that has Working Poors, and lack a sufficient social safety net. Not saying that's true, but you picked a pretty bad example of "left wing".
@_date: 2014-06-18 10:11:55
Do you, or do you not, have a reference to that supposed Nash quote?

Steve Draper has/had almost exactly 30K.

Why do you keep assuming I'm American?

Your comments make it outstandingly clear that you simply don't grasp what game theory is all about. You have slightly deeper than superficial knowledge, but don't really "get" it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 07:04:05
1. You seem to view game theory as a specific singular theory. It's not. Wikipedia: "game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science, including both humans and non-humans (e.g. computers)."
2. Do you have a reference to that Nash quote?
@_date: 2014-06-16 18:19:24
You engineer a better system by using game theory.

Tax free appreciation.

That would be an amazing feat that even the real Satoshi couldn't pull off.
@_date: 2019-02-02 01:26:50
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:44:12
You're forgetting the qualifier "at scale". So yes, you probably can buy coffee _today_ in some places, however if Bitcoin (or any other unsharded blockchain) becomes as mainstream enough, it's not viable.
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:28:30
Well, Segwit2x recently failed to get traction, so 2MB seems dead.

But why does he want fast transactions?
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:12:48
Yes, he wrongly assumed Moore's law applied to Internet traffic.

Why do ppl spell ppl as ppl?

For what? No one else doing the same thing has gotten anything near that. Also, lookup safe harbor. He got railroaded.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:58:04
Hopefully that won't come to pass. Hopefully he'll be free before that. Yeah, I know, unlikely.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:24:56
But Roger was a fan of Lightning, he just couldn't wait. This is what mystifies me. And he's selling online, which doesn't need instant conf, since shipping takes days anyways.
@_date: 2019-01-15 03:49:18
Which is great for the rest of us. Less supply.
@_date: 2018-03-08 02:37:53
I'm not sure about 2-4MB blocks (why is that even remotely probable?), but Lightning Network might be semi-useable by EOY.
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:20:22
Interestingly, eth is only faster because it's used much less. It actually has slower tps than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:01:34
Nah, they'll just set up shop in Venezuela or Trinidad.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:59:46
So you're saying it's coming in May?

I'm surprised no one has built a double-spend wallet yet. For any crypto really.
Or perhaps I haven't looked hard enough?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:38:00
Having the keys is not sufficient to have the coins. You must also make sure no one else have the keys.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:36:04
Paper is about as secure as a hardware wallet, but less convenient, as you can't easily transact.
However it depends on how you generate and print your paper wallet. Where did you get the generator, were you online when generated, is your printer online and is the firmware compromised?
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:13:36
Wouldn't that mostly be solved if pools adopted BetterHash?
Granted, we haven't seen that yet, which is surprising, since I would think such a pool would be attractive.
@_date: 2018-12-20 12:32:07
If you absolutely must use a payment processor, use Coingate (they support Lightning as well), but otherwise use BTCPay server.
@_date: 2018-12-15 22:13:29
You can store your hardware device same place as paper wallet. Or you can reset your device and keep the 24 seed words the same place. There really is no difference.
