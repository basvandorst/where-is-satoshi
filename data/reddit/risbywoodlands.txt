i was always watching but never did anything about it. obviously i was dumb to make rash decisions based on emotion and no logical thinking. now i dont know whether it'll be worth it to hodl on or just cash out and accept defeat

Just a friendly PSA to all new bitcoiners out there - get a decent hardware wallet and write down your recovery seed. also watch out for scammers

People need to give up doing short term predictions. For months folks have been commenting things like "10K this week" or "15K by the end of Friday". No one on this sub has accurately predicted the price of BTC short term. Please just let it do its thing long term. HODL.

i went on bitaddress.org to generate an address and i think it didn't provide a seed phrase and passkey? all i need to keep safe is the private key right?

Is having a paper wallet in 2019 still worth it? I have taken the correct precautions, written down my private key down and stored it offline. There are a few copies, "offline backups" if you will that I know are safe. I am keeping all my bitcoin in this paper wallet. Are there any other, FREE options, other than a trezor/hardware wallet? What's safer? a paper wallet or a hardware wallet?
