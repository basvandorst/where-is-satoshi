Trust is a big factor for me too.  Coinbase has never gone back on something they have said or misrepresented their offering.  Circle has been one disappointment after another.  Take their claim of insuring your bitcoin for instance.  They make this bold claim of saying you are insured but when you look at the fine print, it looks like you're only insured up to $100.
  
Circle has a long way to go before they have proven themselves to me and it would still take a major fuck-up from Coinbase to make me switch.

I'd say that the closer to the halving we get, the more true that statement will be.  But I do not believe that a large percentage of miners are looking that far ahead right now, and if they are, I don't believe they are able to plan that far ahead due to unknown factors.  Mining should be more consolidated as we get closer and the miners who are able to survive the difficulty increases will be better equipped to deal with the halving and will have factored it in.
  
So people who say it's factored into the price right now are wrong and if anyone poses that argument to you, question them on their data!

None of the answers here are correct.  The scam revolves around blockchain.info, the way they handle watch-only addresses in their wallets and a users lack of understanding about how blockchain.info works.  Blockchain.info does not tell you that a wallets address is a watch-only address.  The scammer will create a wallet with some watch-only addresses in it and give you the info to log in.  You login and look at the balance and see the wallet has a positive balance.  But you cannot spend from those addresses since the wallet does not have the private key.  This scam has been around for a while and I think blockchain.info has no excuse for not fixing this and breaking-out the spendable addresses and undependable addresses in the balance section.  As long as they don't fix this, this scam will not go away.

The bot is linking you to nothing more than another circlejerk in respect to while advertising another sub in the process.  The ranked comment system works and if you have an unpopular opinion, you better be able to back it up with facts and information.  There is a difference between questioning something and offering another perspective and straight up trolling and as best I can tell, it's the trolls usually getting downvoted while the well thought out opinions stick and create good conversations.  The bot does not create discussion in it sends people from to circlejerks in other subs and sometimes its the catalyst for vote brigades.

Just because Coinbase knows who you are, doesn't mean the merchant will know who you are.  Coinbase does most everything off-chain and no merchant has a window into that.  You can send coins from Coinbase to a wallet you control and from there, you can spend pseudo-anonymously.  If you want complete anonymity, then you need to put in some effort.  Think of anonymity as freedom because freedom is not free, it requires constant effort to maintain and secure.  Like freedom, you need to work for your anonymity.  This means you need to find someone who is willing to sell you coins without collecting any information from you.  Coinbase is for the average person who doesn't necessarily care about those things.  They have to operate like this to comply with laws and policy and to survive our litigious environment.

Removing the bot does not remove free speech.  I am arguing that it will help to promote participation, not hurt it.  There are very negative consequences to the bots presence.  It discourages participation by people who might otherwise participate in a conversation.  It promotes vote brigading in other threads when one is linked.  It feeds the trolls and encourages them to participate through the bot instead of directly.  it bypasses some of the rules of the sub and allows content that wouldn't otherwise be allowed because of sub rules(the admins are pretty good at catching this one).
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:46:08
1) Bitcoins are not backed by any government.  Hello, isn’t that the point?  Gold and silver aren’t backed by any government either (although they used to be used to back the now truly “virtual” currencies that are only backed by armies and constitutions, which history shows have been known to fail).
2) Bitcoins are highly volatile.  The latest report notes the two days the price fell the sharpest; it makes no mention of the three times it rose exponentially, nor the end result that the price of bitcoin today, despite dropping significantly from its December 2013 peak, is nonetheless more than 50x what it was 24 months ago.  I don’t recall the CFPB warning us not to buy Amazon stock at $106 before it then crashed down to under $7 (it’s more than $300 today).  In other words, bitcoin is not unique in its fluctuation for a game-changing commodity or security.
3) You can lose your bitcoins or someone can steal them.  You can also lose your dollar bills or have them stolen from you on any street corner.
4) There is no federal insurance on bitcoin accounts.  Remember that what that FDIC insurance is guarding you against is rogue bankers making off with your money, which has obviously happened enough (google “savings and loan crisis 1980s” – this is when nearly half the nation’s savings and loan associations went bankrupt and the FSLIC became insolvent and required a government bailout) that it’s been a necessary component of banking.  With bitcoin, one can be perfectly safe with common security measures such as cold storage and encrypted paper wallets, and there are services that will insure the value of holding those pieces of paper in a vault.
5) Bitcoin has been used in crimes.  The CFPB didn’t mention Silk Road or the potential for money laundering, probably because they’re both outside its jurisdiction, but they toted out a 2011 scheme where a Texas man bought 700,000 bitcoins at $6 apiece and then spent much of the money in a Ponzi scheme.  Had he simply held onto the coins, they’d be worth nearly 100x what they were when he bought them. It goes without saying that one can use anything from pork bellies to potato chips in a Ponzi scheme, but that doesn’t make them risky by that fact alone.

Banning a bot is not suppressing a voice.  Anyone who is not banned is free to come to and express their opinion.  Anyone who is banned is free to make a new account and come to and express their opinion.  Bots aren't people, they are tools and this tool is being misused.  The misuse is degrading our community.

It was the same dumbass.  This one person is responsible for a large portion of the FUD around here.

Your roommate running wireshark is going to see you visiting that site regardless of SSL.  It's up to you to obfuscate your traffic, not the site.  Heartbleed is a lovely example of SSL gone bad.  Limiting what services you run on a machine to just the necessities is one of the first steps in securing an environment.

I believe the bet is for it to stay bellow for &gt;48 hours

What are the fees like?

I'm guessing the database is 254GB because it contains everything, not just what's been accepted by the network?

Please take the time in the future to reflect and ensure that you've learned a lesson here.  It will help you later!
  
Remove your cousins credit card and have your cousin give you $993 is my advice.  Stirring up shit with coinbase and your bank is only going to draw scrutiny on you.  Sad to say but that's the reality of it.
 
Then just proceed like it never happened and learn from it.

It's banned?  How do you know this..

That's what they would have to do in order to instantly provide you Bitcoin for an ACH.

I've never seen it down.  :)

Good question!  I'm not sure.  But you could also argue that the link bot just promotes the vote brigade in other instances and makes us look Cultish to outsiders who know nothing about bitcoin.

What's with all the god talk?

It is an example.  An example of how a system can eat itself.  OB has a lot of challenges ahead of it.  A few of those is how society will deal with it and the moral dilemmas it will pose to some.  Some of the outcomes are predictable given enough information.

Coinbase is open to everyone while circle is still invite only.  And I don't think the pittance of a savings with Circle is enough to sway my customer loyalty away from Coinbase who has been flawless for me.

Yea, that's why is running around deleting threads and deleting links that lead to vote brigades.  The proof is in the pudding.

I'd be surprised if Coinbase or Bitpay haven't already been making those sales calls.
@_date: 2014-08-21 19:10:56
I understand you are selling.  Why would anyone buy this from you?  The whole premise sounds made up or you have found a sucker.
