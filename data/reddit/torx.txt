Seems like during the day coins are green, late at night they get blood red.  its an obvious observation ive noticed in the past weeks.  Since im usually awake during the day, and work 3rd shift, sleep a few hours..  I think so, its a battle to either end btc or lower its value so they can buy it back cheaper.

Theres a timed pattern to this.  Anyone thats awake through the night and morning will see, the deep dips happen between 7am-9am central, then it starts to rise and level through the afternoon.  Once late night post 12am, it starts to drop.  Seems to be dropping 1k every day or every 2 days.  The coordinated effort to kill btc value is strong because its going on at a certain time every day like clockwork.

Aorus 1080ti extreme  tdp, 80% fan, 1936mhz/1275 mem,   I fiddled with aorus oc tool and managed to get this tweaked for high mhz low tdp and low temp.
Is my vid card looking right performance wise?
awesomeminer runs between these three algos
lyra2v2 
equihash 
lbry 490-500MH/s
Hows my algos look?  Do i need to remove or add one?
i got one miner, running between those 3 algos, at 10min switching intervals, and the -p c=btc command line
Any settings i should tweak in this app, or is this just fine the way it is?
im using zpool, watching my hot wallet stats, nothing to really ask about this except i wish the payout was sooner than 0.0025
the first 24hrs i earned $7.50 value 17,500
it looks like now im expecting about $4-5 in this 24hr period.  Only thing i changed was the disabling of a bunch of algos.  Any help is appreciated.

If so, which algo would be best for me?

Right now im mining with a 1080ti, awesomeminer, and zpool, with electrum wallet.
Ive got everything setup, and zpool displays info that the gears are turning and btc is created.
Heres my confusion, my electrum wallet has a bunch of addresses in the address tab that i dont recognize ever using, only the top two.  The first address is set in awesomeminer with zpool settings.  How and when will i know i got a deposit. Zpool changed their payout to a couple times a week.
I see the time in top right but im worried for some reason i wont receive anything in electrum for some unknown reason.
I also noticed on zpool my 2nd wallet made a tiny amount yesterday but it never got sent to my electrum wallet, how do i receive that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:13:45
My current setup is 1080ti, awesome miner, zpool, and electrum.  zpool says i have two wallets with a tiny bit of btc, the 1st wallet was the first address i tested mining with. 
Electrum changed address so reconfigured awesomeminer, and now have a tiny bit in that address too.
My question is, how do i transfer the first wallet btc to my electrum?  I'm guess my 2nd wallet address (that im currently configured to) will payout at the next payout period??  Both wallets have barely nothing, like cents, but ive been mining for 24+hrs i thought i'd have more.  thx.
edit:  my 2nd wallet is $1.32 for 18hrs of work, is this right?  i feel like theres something im missing or setting needs changing..

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:26:46
I think the bitcoin billionaires, millionaires, and thousandaires have already cashed out at around 15k-18k...  and leaving the newbies, hodlers, and optimists behind on the sinking ship.  All the quick rich investors are jetting.  It could very well have turned out to be an elaborate ponsi scheme.  I sure as fuk hope not.

MY concern with bitcoin is collecting those x.xxxxx numbers.. i could care less about that comparative, $$$
people are using the tech for the wrong reason, to boost their pockets real quick..  i still think that time has came and went, the winklevoss twins are some of the few that hinted to us that the top tier gainers have already cashed out and moved onto other profitable things.
if bitcoin value doesnt go up, i feel like this should be the time we focus more on replaced fiat with btc..  and not replacing btc with fiat for profit gain... but you cant tell people shit, in one ear out the other.

Ayy if someone had did that forreal, we'd be over 9k today.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:03:14
That same people that pop in here and say 100k by end of year, speculators, wallstreet, etc are the whales or big bag holders.  Theyre selling an idea, peopke buy in, price goes up and the whales selloff dumping it.  Be careful listening to those with big claims by end of year.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:54:36
Heres my theory, btc will drop to low sub 1k, by then a quantum computer will have claim to crack/decrypt all cryptocurrency.  Crypto will goto 0 or close, and thats it.
The cash out was in december 2017.

@_date: 2018-06-15 04:43:44
he already bought in at a large lump, or many lumps...  putting this news and gossip out makes others buy in, then when it goes up a grand or two hes more than likely dumps it.  rinse and repeat.
im confident alot of the whales are "investors/analysts with these wild predictions"
if they have the power to put a news article in, they got the lumps of crypto ready to sell and dump at the slightest spike up.
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:07:19

If bitcoin is set to become a one world currency, its gonna settle at much much less.  6k, 5k is too much.
Probably settle down to 0.000000001 btc =  1 world coin.

Tread lightly people, everytime "news" about btc about to breakout or exceed 8k releases, ppl fomo then it drops hard.  Ive seen this time and time agsin.  Whales are manipulating news and creating false hope here and online everywhere so people buy in then the whales sell off and dump dropping the value by hundreds.  Ive seen this pattern time and time again since january.  The highs are getting lower and lower and thats a fact.

we arent moving fast enough in trading our crypto for goods and services.  it'll take a major goods chain to bring higher adoption.. someone like walmart or macdonalds.   holders get bored, scared, then sell back at a loss.  we arent supposed to be holding, we're supposed to be spending.

maybe it'll drop another 3k and we can finally put a nail in this coffin.  take our losses and forget this even happened.

it could easily drop to 2850 as the bottom in the coming months..  i wouldnt call this the bottom yet..  but i too am hopeful

we'll need a digital form of currency that can be used both here on earth and on mars.  There wont be a federal reserve like facility to print out money.  There has to be a digital form of currency to exchange between those of us on earth, those on mars, and those sending to and from mars.

Coinbase doesnt update the btc values when its dropping, but will update it fast when its rising.  Its a trick to get you to spend more for far less.  I realized this during the 7500 drop.  Its a scam.  I gotta figure out a better alternative.  It literally stayed at 8000 at multiple buy attempts, when gdax and the prices tab was down to 7800 for a while.  I said wtf is this shit.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:29:51
All my altcoins are taking a shit except my reddcoins.  Each day seems to be a different altcoin doing better than others.  I suspect everyones trading back to btc.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:03:48
Coinbase is the biggest scam ever.
It'll update the buy@ value faster when its going up, so you pay more and get less btc.  Then update never or slower when the btc value goes down.  So youre paying more for less, big fucking scam.  I gotta stop using this shitapp.
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:58:02
As much as i want to believe, and i am a holder not a fudder... i cant see this happening..  we can barely break thru 9k.
Is the end goal of btc really to have an enormously huge value?  Or should it be at a low value but more valuable than the usd so we can actually have and use a stable currency.

I noticed alot of bounce backs happen at x000 or even'd zero numbers.
If you remind yourself that youre byying bitcoin and not us dollars, youll be fine.  Remind yourself that as long as it dips it doesnt cost as much to buy the same amount you bought previously a day ago. I just try to keep a level head and spend as much as i can afford in increments.

I got tired and bored of the endless ups and downs..  i now get to where i check the value maybe a few times a day instead of all day..  only time i'll worry again is below 5500.
Until then, no cares, just keep buying here and there on the "lows".  I put lows in quotes because btc is always at a low depending on what point you invested most at.

If you keep that in mind, the dips, the runs, the crashes, the moons..  DONT FUCKING MATTER.

Articles like this signal a big dump incoming.  From my observations experience, ive noticed this.  After a positive bull run articles makes its rounds, bitcoin dumps hard.  I think these are people with large stakes in bitcoin using news outlets as their pump and dump tool.
Once readers buy into these articles and buy in at the fomo rises, these "analysts" sell off and dump btc.  Happens everytime.  None of these articles have been true since the beginning of this year.  Its news manipulation.

6700 is the threshold?
i might sell off all my coins at a loss and just forget about this bs.  manipulators win, theres no way around it.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:46:16
I wont celebrate till we are over 15k.  Until then....  business as usual.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:31:26
news and politics has never had an effect.  btc is unpredictable except for the big whales and insiders who are manipulating it all.
we're just along for the ride.

Dont understand why everyones so excited, does anyone not use pattern recognition for the past 6 months-year?
Get ready for the drop soon in the coming days.  Just take advantage of this high to sell if you want profit.
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:05:04
It may not be 5000, but i told yall yesterday to expect another massive drop..  but you downvoted me.  People dont listen, take these crazy up and down swings to your advantage, buy low sell high, rinse repeat..  whoevers manipulating the market is giving everyone a chance to play and make money.  Holding is obviously a bad deal right now.

@_date: 2018-04-07 04:06:51
I dont think we should be holding either.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:48:04
Same shit, different week.  Too predictable.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:03:03
I rather not associate bitcoin with political news anymore.  Ive realized btcs ups and downs have nothing to do with holidays, news, politics, stock market, etc..
Bitcoin is its own roller coaster ride non associating with others, therefore NOT PREDICTABLE.

Theres always regret in this game.  No way around it.
Regret not buying more when its low.  Regret not selling when its high.  Regret selling when its going down because its gonna keep going down, and vice versa when its up and up.  Its constant regret in this crypto game.
Do like me and buy btc when u can afford to.  If u miss out on an ultra low, well...fuck it, there will be another opportunity.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:27:51
whoever is doing these violent swings are giving all of us a chance to bank on it.  of course the ones that bought in at 13k+ and held are losers right now... but its obvious the roller coaster is allowing us to swing trade if youre patient.
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:39:05
See you all at 5000 monday morn.
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:27:32
Ive seen this one too many times.  run ups to 10,11,12k and booom!  dumpster diving again.  not getting my hopes up, i just buy btc when i got spare cash and try to forget about the ups and downs.
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:20:32
In december i learned that these bitcoins change designs yearly.  I did not know that.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:01:43
Supports are an illusion.  I wish people would stfu with their bitcoin lingo, its not predictable, there has never been a support, just ride the huge candle dicks till you cum or fall off.
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:27:07
Hope everyone enjoyed that low to high spike and made some profit..  if not, then maybe the next go around you'll be lucky.  Here comes the red dumpening.  Get ready for it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:33:50
Step Pyramid of Djoser pattern incoming.
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:30:13
Glad i didnt fomo and buy into anything.  I saw this coming, same shit diff weekend.  Very predictable now.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:05:23
All im thinking is... sunday and monday is coming, expecting the usual drop off into the mariana trench.
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:03:51
We'll see a steady 5k soon.  Im just setting and forgetting.  Fuk it.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:09:33
Simple, fiat burn.  Much like coin burns.
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:07:41
We're at the mercy of the bots.  Seriously doubt humans have any role in btc pumps and dumps.  Its grown a mind of its own.  It'll take you down and humble you, then pump you up when you least expect it or have forgotten about it.

People made money on the way up, and people are making money on the way down...you just have to not sleep.
