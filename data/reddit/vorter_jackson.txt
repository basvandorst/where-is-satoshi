This normally occurs on an exchange. You have to fund an account on one from a bank account. Then place a buy order at a set or "market" price. The exchange then tries to fill the order.
Selling is the same, you setup a sell order for X amount of your prefered (national) currency or go by the market rate. Then withdraw it to a bank account.

At the risk of sounding like a drunken fool barely able to keep one eye open at this point, is this not like like the chicken and the egg problem? You need an anon exchage to exchange an anon currency, but that requires some level of legitimacy and authentication only provided by a centeral authority. And besides that it runs afoul of legislation of most countries for the transfer and transmission of money.

Just playing devils advocate here, but couldn't his point be about the perceived value of both? People hoarded the coupons and people saw them as less valuable as they provided a fixed service, and had a finite supply. Maybe that's the key section "fixed service/value". Bitcoins will always fluctuate against other currencies, its purchasing power will go up and down because we are not likely to junk nation-state currencies right now for everyday living. Where as the coupons will always get you 1 hour, even if no ones buying.
Then again I am not so sure how Bitcoins are different from Gold. Gold has a finite supply for the foreseeable future, holds its value mainly based on perceived value, is held by many people and traded and its price fluctuates against other commodities and currencies. All of which can be said of Bitcoins, minus the storage problem (and fee). Would be nice to get some real analysis and not the regular crap that's been thrown around in the media.

Same. I went in a bit early and got out mostly when it was high. I know that irks some but I didn't believe the ~250-60 level was sustainable, even if I knew Bitcoin wasn't some ponzi-scheme or massive bubble. I went in trying to make some money, I don't see anything wrong with that. Along the way though I've learned a lot about finance and the technology of Bitcoin. And still I am finding myself glued to the charts. It's been a lot of fun.
I think the future really hinges on decentralized exchanges and built-in escrow. Bitcoin might not provide all of that over its life-span. But little is going to be able to stop someone from expanding on those ideas.

Doesn't look like it. The lag is gone and a sell off starts. Now more lag.
I expect Mt Gox to setup trading hours after this week. That should limit their share of transactions, forcing people to other exchanges. They have to take some responsibility and act accordingly.

Bitcoins cannot be destroyed nor can any authority or network participant invalidate transactions that were the result of fraud (unless they acquire a significant amount of the processing power of the network). I don't think you understand how this works.

Fairly new. Transaction times are meant to be faster then Bitcoin. It's traded on exchanges like Vircurex and Cryptsy. Some people are pumping its value every now and then, I'm holding a smaller amount for no real reason.

I have used them to buy and sell. They're fast and even though they're small there's not a lot of price volatility as you said. The 2 step authentication is pretty nice to have also and their fees are reasonable ($2 interac E-Transfer and 4$ bank transfer on withdrawals). If you're dealing in CAD I would go with them.

Paypal is not a good idea for buying or selling, as Bitcoin transactions are nonreversible and Paypal and CC processors allow charge backs. If you sold for example outside an exchange someone could scam you in this manner. Similarly the exchanges don't want to get scammed. Funding an exchange account is normally done through a bank deposit.
Your exchange account will have a Bitcoin wallet created for you, it's represented by a string of numbers and letters. Such as (1D6totsMxtHZByCmJhsUYeq36ECgpcHhzm). 
The market like a lot of currency markets is extremely volatile. Currency is not normally something advised for individual investors. Doing what you said buying low and selling high is called timing the market, which is not advised. It just doesn't work. Buying such low volume will also yield low return. If you do plan on buying some BTC still always go by the simple rule of never risking what you can't stand to lose.

Last I checked mainstream Conservatives are not for "no Government", that's anarchy not modern Conservatism.
While they may be more apt to agree that you cannot regulate away the darker sides of human nature, and doing so with more regulation and political fixes is a waste of time... they are more likely to support what I believe is a centralized financial system (not more regulated, but more pointed towards something structured) and tend to support a more hawkish position on the security side aswell.

Good and bad are subjective, a blacklist can be good in the eyes of some who have no stake or concern for Bitcoin's future or the future of the monetary and financial system.

There's no precedent or reason to believe that a diminished American/Western empire would not see the rise of a Russian or Chinese one. And as much as we are hypocrites and can't really fancy ourselves as more moral or ethical then those nations, I believe at the very least the Western focus on individually and liberty (however compromised by current affairs) is what sets the Western World apart and what makes us if not superior to those two examples then at least more deserving and more fit to lead.
Having more perticipating in the IMF and World Bank by developing nations and a few other minor things are doable and probably a good idea. But a monumental shift away from the US is not likely and (I hate to say it) probably not a good idea if we are interested in peace and human progress.

You can sell in the dark pool, which won't sway the current price. If you want.

You can try LocalBitcoins.com but buying and selling outside of exchanges is sort of risky. Some exchanges allow different funding options, shop around. And don't use Mt Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:27:46
Why in the world would BTC Guild limit their hash rate? Because some people see the need for it and are willing to sacrifice if it means the long term viability of the system.
Why would Mt Gox limit their hours? Because apparently they can't be trusted to run an exchange 24/7, 365 days of the year. Yes currency exchanges never shut down. But if Gox can't be trusted to run at least somewhat smoothly part of the time, when they do most of the transactions for the network, then we have to ask these kind of questions.
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:07:43
I think it's fair, but maybe not so much for Mt Gox but for the market in general. For Bitcoin to work it can't have a "centralized" exchange, the whole point of the system is that it's not only anonymous but decentralized. The best we can do at this point is diversify and expand on the number of active and competitive exchanges, which the market isn't moving towards. The blame lies with Gox as much as it does with anyone using them.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:56:31
Anytime someone suggest Mt Gox do something like that they get shat on for saying the exchange should limit their growth (or help their competitors).

@_date: 2013-04-04 16:32:58
I think the easiest way to explain it to someone is this. Why do you think the dollar in your pocket is important or "worth something"? Why do you think everyone around you thinks the same way? Because we have faith that that dollar is worth something, we believe that it means something to us and to other people. There's no "fundamentals" to fiat currency (at least the Euro and US dollar) beyond the size and current value of the currency supply, nothing that should particularly restrain it.
Bitcoins operate on the same premise. Why are Bitcoins worth something? Because people believe they are. And in particular we believe it is a better system of currency void of the inherent risks of fiat currency.
I don't fault the media so much because it is a hard concept to understand. People have lived with fiat currency for well over a hundred years. And even before that it has always been the domain of and had the involvement of Government. The recent decision to regulate some businesses around Bitcoin was a positive signal that the Feds weren't looking to shut it down (at least not yet). The price thus went up. It also didn't hurt that some European technocrats decided to rob the bank accounts of a tiny island blind at the same time.
@_date: 2013-09-03 15:25:07
Bitcoin will act more like a commodity in the long run, a very volitile one that is open to the possibility of regulation severely depressing it (if not ending the experiment). You should treat it as extremely high risk when considering it for an investment. It is possible to trade cryptocurrencies for profit, but given that its equivalent in the real-world currency market is not really a place for small investors to play in... Bitcoin too is not the best place to put your 401k or RRSP.
That said, a lot of people have a vested interest in it at least holding some value and while it doesn't fluxuate or pair to anything physical or concrete as a currency or stock would, things such as network difficulty rising can eventually effect its value. And so can it's general acceptance and perceived value.

@_date: 2013-04-12 03:46:54
You can trade BTC anytime you want, there's no central authority. I think Mt Gox has to acknowledge that Bitcoin was never meant to have a centralized exchange, as Gox has become. Being crappy doesn't seem to be an impediment for their customers, thus the market suffers. And Bitcoin won't be taken seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:27:48
Do you see a future for Bitcoin with the current situation, having a "centralized" exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:43:23
I am only suggesting it as a means to an end. Gox right now is a large and vulnerable centralized part of a mostly decentralized system, the viability of that system and their continued revenue stream depends on the decisions they make. One could make the case that no one ideally should have the power they do over the entire market. I think that demands some self sacrifice.
It doesn't look like people are moving away from them and that clustering is creating all of these problems.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:04:54
greedy corruption.
No one is pretending that Bitcoins won't be used for anything including what most world Governments consider illegal. But so can their currency, so can gold, so can oil, so can anything.
What is unknown right now is if people are actually putting their faith in this or just jumping on the bandwagon while the getting is good. I would say that faith is warranted given the basic design and inherent security in the system. That said, nothing goes up forever. And nothing goes up this fast and holds its value. If Bitcoin is to be useful as either a currency or as a commodity like gold, it has to act like at least one.
If the value and the rise in value is directly related to the actual use (as in buying items or services), and not the speculation then that has to become more clear. Can Bitcoin just be the virtual version of gold, and not function as a currency? That raises more questions about value. We value gold, silver and the like because they are rare. We have Litecoin now and other cryptocurrencies, why should we value bitcoins more then a litecoin. It again falls to us, we decide collectively that gold/litecoins/bitcoins all are valuable and thus hold their value or not. That's a concept not easily understood or explained to people so use to fiat currency and TBTF banking.

It wouldn't help, unless some exchanges are going out of business I have yet to hear about. The one thing you can rarely account for is the human factor, people will cluster (Gox) and people will be greedy, thus the volatility. Nothing is perfect.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:49:40
All valid points. I would only say that it could become more popular for large transactions and transactions that cross borders and maybe even seen as a useful and cost effective store of value. With wires now becoming more restricted and costly it could take on a share of that. The technology and application is not there yet for micro-transactions. I am unsure if Bitcoin is even useful for that period.
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:06:14
Sorry to hear you lost out on the MCXFee. I was tempted a couple of times. Even transferring your coins out right now still incur fees (most of which go to RealSolid) so the guy honestly has no excuse. He could have eliminated the fees for withdrawal for this period and paid out ~.20 on MCXFee but that would have cost him money.
And the worst part of it is he's planning to come back. The Bitcoin and Altcoin community should send this asshole a message: Don't come back.

I bought some coin off Mr. Ng. The first time I did was with him. There was no problems at all since it was escrowed. I did it using an Interac transfer and it went through. But RBC then called and froze my account saying people had made claims of fraud against him. I said it was simply a currency transaction and they were like "oh, okay well just to let you know any future transactions to this person will not go through". I just hung up.
I think what happened is because you take a lot of risk selling outside of exchanges but not buying he got scammed with fraud charges and charge backs. I guess a few people scammed him that way when buying and it flagged his account. Real shitty that people would do that.
And the bank in question (his and mine): Royal Bank of Canada. Which just happens to be up to a lot of no good domestically.

Agreed and that's why there is a massive potential for btc and other instruments. Future meltdowns are likely to include more bail-ins. Its more of an issue for Europe but recently my country (Canada) while having pretty well capitalized and stable banks found it appropriate to signal their intent to create a bail-in system for when any large bank fails. It sounds crazy and something both unlikely and in the far distant future. The g20 and US like to make it sound like the crisis the meltdown caused was adverted that all is well. But they never fixed anything. There's just as many risks to the global economy as there was in the last decade. Maybe more so. If the derivative market were to go sour for example, that a market 3 times global GDP. How the fuck do you bail that out?

I am. It's probably one of the main reasons legitimate businesses have been weary of accepting BTC. Not that I am happy about the Feds attacking something that should be a secure and private forum for the purchase and sale of goods (I am a bit libertarian on drug issues), especially after their attack recently on the Tor Network.
That's not to say people like the owner of SR and the guy behind Freedom Hosting were not and are still not scumbags and douchebags. Just that in the grand scheme of things the problem the authorities in the US have isn't so much that they're selling drugs or helping CP freaks hide. If either were actual problems we wanted to tackle we could do much better. It's that they challenged the notion that online commerce and communication HAS TO BE subject to scrutiny, that going out of your way to be off the grid while not illegal is still something we should avoid.

I'm not so sure. I saw the trade engine lag mostly clear up then a sell off start up. I think they pulled the plug because of another potential overnight (EST anyway) sell off.
I think all those who scrounged up some BTC during the Gox outage had more of a vested interest in the price jumping as it did to 120-130s. Then the lag cleared, the price wasn't going any higher so a sell off ensued. Those people wanted out or at least a profit and Gox didn't want to cause more panic.
