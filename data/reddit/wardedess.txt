I’m not a fan of EOS, but Steem was a good project. Regardless, he’s made an ungodly amount of wealth for himself.
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:44:00
Yeah, it’s interesting to look back at that conversation now knowing what’s all transpired since.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:52:08
It’s not a scam. Do you own any rare digital art or any sort of Counterparty tokens?
@_date: 2019-07-08 23:58:34
That’s a good question...
@_date: 2019-07-08 23:52:11
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:44:47
You’re right, but ultimately it’s supporting miners since a BTC Tx fee is paid every time you want to utilize a feature in Counterparty.

It sort of seems so, and Satoshi’s response is it’s unnecessary, which then got an agreement after a reconsideration by Larimer.

This is a good educational piece. The title threw me for a moment, thinking you might be Alex Winter, but I see the THE. You ended it on an ominous note, which I found especially poignant given the more recent news of LIBRA and DIDs.

It would cost over 10% in fees to buy a plant with BTC vs 0.1% with BCH. I feel like BTC is scamming its users with such high fees. Props to OP for accepting and spreading crypto adoption!

Wow. LinkFixerBotSnr. Much thanks.

Nope, I'm not even an accountant, just sharing someone else's thoughts.

Wow. Selper. So Smart. Much thanks.

I dropped out of a PhD in Finance because of professors like him.

You should ask r/dogecoin. They would appreciate the idea. Either way, I would watch it. I find it hard to believe only 33% like this. What inhumours basterds.

Thank you very much

Not that I know of, but I wasn't on here all of yesterday and earlier today, so possibly...
@_date: 2019-03-07 02:59:15
I agree with OP, as I just posted the same. It probably will come to represent grin if it isn’t already.

Time-energy accounting makes me think of the mining process. Bitcoin is a switchover from double to triple ledger accounting. Plus, this was long before the internet existed in any households or any household even had a computer. Whereas in 1997, Adam Back had already proposed Hashcash, two years prior to this video. 
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:25:28
R. Buckminster-Fuller predicted it in his book Critical Path published in 1981! 
“The computerized switchover from the inherently-inadequate-life-support accounting assumption of yesterday to the adequate-for-everyone-and-everything, time-energy accounting comprehensively employed by the multibillion-galaxied, eternally regenerative Universe itself. An exclusively-to-be-accomplished, world-around-integrated, computer-facilitated, cosmically compatible accounting switchover will make it popularly comprehensible that we do indeed have four billion billionaires on our planet, thereby publicizing that fact and thereby inducing the systemic release of their heritage to all Earthian humans.”

Well, I was born a bitcoin miner’s daughter
In a house next to my daddy’s alma mater
We were poor but we had love
That’s the one thing that daddy made sure of
He’d hash a block just to make a poor man’s dollar
My daddy would work all night in the cryptocoin mines
All day long, jamming up the main line
Mommy rocked the baby’s at night
And read reddit by the iphone light
And we’d say our prayers to Satoshi Nakamoto
Daddy loved and raised 8 kids on a miner’s pay
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a keyboard every day
Why, I’ve seen her hands so raw
To some we were bourgeoise
But i know our clothes were bought on ebay
In the summertime we couldn’t download any apps
And at Christmas there weren’t no presents to unwrap
And my family saved every bit
Just to watch another currency split
My daddy always complained about the wealth gap
Yeah I’m proud to be a bitcoin miner’s daughter
I remember well our family treading water
The work we done was hard
But a free economy was our reward
I just hope the rig doesn’t get any hotter
Well, a lot of things have changed since way back then
Like the assassination of the Winklevoss twins
Investors used to be galvanized
Now the market is decentralized
Just like the memory of this bitcoin miner’s daughter

Bitpay credits the business' bank account for the $ value at the time of the transaction and takes the Bitcoin. The business never actually has the Bitcoin. Thus, Bitpay is taking on all of the volatility, and this crash is not good for them.

Can someone explain blockchain.info's Global Bitcoin Nodes? It's found here:  
It says there are 931 nodes connected (at the moment). Does that mean there are 931 people with Bitcoin-QT running? Also, there are 22 miners. Does that mean there are 22 mining pools? I imagined there would still be more than that.

This could *imply* that Yuan will be more valuable and transferrable. Maybe you should sell some of your Bitcoin for Yuan on BTCChina. Bitcoin has been selling at a premium on BTCChina, which *implies* an exchange rate closer to $1=5yuan rather than 6.09 as it stands now. I don't know where the yuan will go if allowed to float freely. Perhaps it'll go to $1=1yuan or $1=10yuan. 
Just my 2 bits.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:47:45
I am now in position 2826 after 9 hours! Is this because of blockchain.info or Bitcoin's protocol?
@_date: 2013-11-19 20:58:10
Do you need Yuan? I don't think it's easy to sell Yuan for USD. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:38:44
China has pretty strict currency controls from my understanding, which is what makes Bitcoin so valuable to its residents.

When going to link to the transaction, I saw the estimated confirmation time of 21 hours, and that it's queue position 2839. This reminds me of trying to get confirmed on Mt. Gox.

So if you go to a bar and buy a beer with Bitcoin, you'll have to tip two parties (bartender and miner).

A code is generated at whatever the current rate is when you click to buy with Bitcoin. The merchant gets whatever they have the price set at. They have no risk.

I'll give you an upvote for that, but that just gave me an idea for a new submission.

I sold my Econ professor 1 Bitcoin last summer after grades were submitted. I made him pay the market rate.

Explain this to me: 
Also, BTC is unused by ISO. ISO isn't using XBT, it's used by Bloomberg for their ticker. They don't get the final say.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:36:27
I tend to use and prefer Bitcoin as the plural. Also, I'm in favor of BTC rather than XBT.
