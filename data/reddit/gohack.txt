I don't know if I will wake up tomorrow or not. That being said I've seen rises and falls. Now a double crash leading into a double launch with an side of bcash is new scenery. 4000$ or 4100$ is new territory. I doubt that btc will sink below 3k in the near future. (If ever again) I still haven't sold my bitcoin. It's tempting sure, but I'd almost rather lose it all than sell myself short.

I usually don't wrack up 5k a week on coinbase with my credit cards. As for personal info. I mean localbitcoins or bitcoin atms are usually an option. Even if I didn't use it I would probably keep the app for price peeks. Yeah, I don't store my coins there, but I don't really have any reason to hate them.

Anyone can say hold. Not everyone gets to feel hold.

I told my friend he can have an item I lent him if it hits 5,000 in the next two weeks.

I sold all my litecoin ~50 a week-week 1/2 ago. I dumped half in etherium and half in bitcoin. I waited till 300$ to dump my etherium. Normally I would pump more into bitcoin, but in all honesty I expect a price correction sooner rather than later. I dumped the 4k from etherium into my finances. I'm in bitcoin for the long ride, but I don't have any idea where the peak or the dip lay. I just know that the momentum can only go on for so long, and that the dip probably won't be marginal.

That sounds like someone whispering "the south will rise again." softly as they look at a tattered confederate flag in a museum. Honestly the split doesn't feel all that contentious as it seemed at first. It's more of a hair cut, than a civil war. But you never know if your hairdresser might take an ear one day. ;)

You can’t watch btc prices forever.

I didn’t have the assets at the time. Sometimes you also need to expand your contingency fund. Life can get exspensive really fast and bitcoin is a really easy to liquidate asset. I’ve cashed out multiple times for various reasons.

I only had .1 bitcoin by the time it fully crashed. Like I said buy incrementally, and sell in portions. If you think it's crashing sell off small chunks. I sold a good portion at ~3k down to 2.8k, and I bought back in at 2500-2380ish. Just don't cash out all at once. or buy in all at once. Try to recognize trends/patterns and use your judgement to make a decission.
Edit: People always tell you the bottom will be lower than it ends up being by like a few hundred dollars. Bitcoin pretty much never crashes lower than the previous time it crashed. Exceptions are always going to exist, but minimizing your risk on an investment is doable to some extent.

Never invest what you can't afford to lose. Never borrow more than you can pay back. Never lend more than you can afford to lose. Investing in something you don't have experience with or understand is always going to be a bad idea. I like the chaotic nature of bitcoin, because it gives me buy in checkpoints. Ltc has stability but it's goal is to be the the change jar not the gold bar. Pipe dream stabilizes and deflates the pricing. The holder hoards in the face of decline the inexperienced sell on the drop of a pin. The volatility increases opportunity for those who see it as e-bullion to add to their collection. I agree with what you're saying, and respect that you're trying to give people more realistic expectations. Educating yourself is a personal responsibility though. A fool and his money are often parted? Everyone plays the fool sometimes, but very few rewards come without risk. I agree with what you're saying I just don't think it's bad. Failure is part of learning. Etherium is conceptually different. Ltc is pretty stable, but time will tell.
(Faster doesn't always mean better. (Example bank transfers on average take 3 days. I never suggested pouring all your chips in one lot either. I own a smaller portion of etherium, and might reinvest in Ltc if they start to receive a bit more reaching acceptance.) Ltc just doesn't have much attention, and etherium is lacking when it comes to underlining trends.)said

I'm buying as many as I can get my hands on. The 3k peak was indicative of the collapse. If I'm right this will fluctuate ~2 weeks. Buy now if you want in. This is your chance. No I don't know the future, but patterns repeat so sell me your bitcoins, or hold onto them. You may never see a sub 2.5k listing again in all honesty.

I wouldn't buy anything with doge in its name on principle.

I sold and bought more.

I can start a wallet and croud fund it. Is it feasible or a good idea? No, but if the only alternatives are surrender or usurp the Chinese. Then prepare to fight for the new dynasty.

While an asteroid could come hurling into the earth and kill us all at any given time, it's very unlikely. Bitcoins do this every two months or so. While past correlating events do not guarantee future recovery and growth, I'm throwing in as much money as I can afford to lose. If I lose it all so be it, but everything is telling me buy buy buy. Alternatively chuck some money in Eth. It's still in its early phase, but adoption is coming fast. I remember it was 30$ and I didn't buy because it didn't look like much. That was mid March? It's at 326$ currently.

It creeped towards 3k two or three times within a period of a few days. Whenever there's huge growth and then tentative attempts at breaking a new ceiling there's a good chance that it's going to plummet for a few days, and then repeat the cycle. The thing is the plummet almost never drops below the previous which is a good way to predict when you should rebuy. I sell and buy incrementally to minimize loss and maximize gain. I learned my lesson way too many times on speculation. Seems like it's on the rebound already though. *knocks on wood*

LTC has never really tried to be a bitcoin competitor, and etherium is conceptually different than bitcoin. I do agree with what you're saying though. Blindly holding isn't the answer, and viewing value fluctuations and past growth as absolute indication for future growth and potential is ignorant. The pipe dream mentality contributes to the pricing somewhat though, so I can't really complain about it. I just don't take advice from your average btc redditor seriously.
