thank you for that well thought out and elaborate answer. I have been ver interested in IPFS specifically, but I have yet to contribute in any meaningful way. although I have just gotten my first raspberry pi kit, so maybe some sort of IPFS.
I guess something like that would be the first baby step. Maybe a dropbox like app that runs on IPFS.

I think two things. It’s not doomed to fail. Facebook wield a ton of influence. Second, even if it fails, doesn’t necessarily mean that it rubs off on bitcoin, quite the opposite. They are backing ‘Libra” with ‘real’ money? What does that even mean anymore.

yeah that's what I'm thinking too.

their 'open platform' page goes to a '404 page not found' error. not exactly instilling me with a lot of confidence off the bat.

damn I thought you were going to post the keys to your bitcoin, which I've read should be a mistake. but I take things very literal. which is why I like this place. it's all about math.

that's funny :) I guess you could technically capture CNN frame by frame live, and print each frame on a sheet of toilet paper, and in that sense it could. But that would require a lot of legwork, and even then it would be kind of in vain since you wouldn't use it anyway. Maybe as an art installation?

What guide did you use? Can I ape your great looking success here? I just bought one, and I haven't decided on a project yet, but I always wanted to do a lightning node.

According to my spectrum analysis that means that the year low of 2019 will be around $2775. 
Let’s see.
