This whole thing is super messed up. When a bug is disclosed, the other side makes it public, exploits it and takes down their network. When it isn't disclosed before patching, they are going closed source.
Behaviour from both sides is horrendous, and I'm not sure which is worse.
Either way, none of it is good for Bitcoin. The competition is just sitting back with the popcorn at this point.

Evidence is not even relevant. The fact is, the behaviour of both camps in this messy dispute is causing bad press on mainstream news channels which will further damage the sentiment around Bitcoin.

Is this a joke? The guys opening delivery is a poorly executed, self-conscious Robin Williams impersonation, doesn't even know how to look down a camera, looks like he's in a college dorm room, and is interviewing "Bitcoin Jesus". Just wow.
Honestly, until recently I was on the fence about this whole debate, but then I saw this:
And with John Mcafee involved, the guy who gives absolutely no fucks, the guy who openly admits that his own software that bears his name was a piece of shit, the guy who has shown time and time again that personal gain is his number one motive. Well, I quickly realised there is something very shady going on over there.
The problem is that from where I'm sitting the Core camp has also not exactly behaved amazingly, but regardless, I do trust them more, despite the Reddit censorship issues which I do not agree with, and in fact caused further fracturing of the community.
It's almost like choosing between Hillary and Trump, except that Bitcoin has no Bernie.

All great points. I can think of a couple of fabless companies doing some cutting edge stuff really well with teams of less than 20 people.
Possibly the biggest obstacle is the volatility of Bitcoin and the possibility that it could come crashing down. And with no other use case for the product, you need some pretty big balls to commit.

Not necessarily. If you want bigger blocks there is an option.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:17:10
I didn't ignore any of it.
The company I work for as a product design consultant is a market leader, makes their own ASICs, uses a contract manufacturer (for silicon, we manufacture everything else in-house), and have never had a design cloned. We've seen hilarious Chinese products with our name screen printed on them, but never a clone.
We do have solid patents, but our biggest defence is agility and supplier relationships. By the time a competitor cloned us, we'd have the next rev out, and we are two revs ahead of the release schedule, so the competition only see our stuff that to us is old news. This is our motivation to keep innovating, and the motivation for our customers to keep buying our products.
All of this can be pulled off regardless of location which is what you said initially that I was responding to.
And be careful assuming what qualifications strangers may and may not have. It could make you look silly.

Where are the claims, beside the Linkedin page?
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:50:40
Thanks for your thought provoking answers! A couple of comments:


Can you clarify exactly who you're talking about here? I was under the impression that a lot of the community (not only miners) supported a bigger blocks scaling solution.
From what I've been reading in my admittedly limited research, the main criticism of Segwit is decentralisation in a way that can potentially harm anonymity and control of transactions.
So the lightning network is Open Source, but some IP in Segwit isn't?
I think the issue is with an off chain solution without bigger blocks on the main chain. This does render the main chain less useful, surely? And to me, it doesn't make any economic sense saying that the miners want full blocks. Why would they want full blocks? They make less money than if they had more transactions per block, the network firing on all cylinders, adoption rising and the price going up.
I will concede that it does indeed make sense that miners want transactions to stay on the main chain because of fees. My question is, if the transactions are done off chain, who collects the fees? This is something I haven't seen noted at all. Is this why Axa is involved? Not trolling, serious question. There must be a reason why they are involved and so far I haven't figured out what it is.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:48:57
Very true. But maybe it's time to move on now?
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:11:50


Is the only part that seems relevant to me. Happy to be explained otherwise.
People have designed customised CPU's (ASICs) which have been patented. Is this also against the spirit of this?
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:47:40
Ok, so just make it clear that you are in fact forking off from the whitepaper so people (hashpower) can know clearly what they are voting for. That's totally fine.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:51:33
I may be wrong, but I would guess that when the big blockers fork off, there will be no need for the SegWit chain to go through with the 2x compromise.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:24:26


You and me both. Both sides are not innocent in this war. This is the reason for my OP
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:16:33
ELI 5 why scaling the main chain based on Satoshi's code example is a flawed approach:
    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
        maxblocksize = largerlimit
What are the pitfalls and dangers of this?
Edit: Why on earth would this question get downvoted? I'm trying to understand more about one of the most important issues in Bitcoin, I was reading through some stuff written by Satoshi himself, and had a question about it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:53:56
This IMO is actually Bitcoins biggest obstacle as we move towards sustainable business practices in the future. When the general public start realising how much energy is being burned for the sake of cryptocurrency security, there will be an outcry. POW calculations would ideally be used to solve actual problems.
But the inherent cost of mining does provide a useful baseline value for the currency.

Let's just break the 400 patents thing into verifiable facts first:
* The Coindesk article cites Reuters as its source


There is no mention of the figure 400. This already indicates that the Coindesk article is junk journalism.
* Where does it say anywhere that the 50 patents have anything to do with Bitcoin? It just says blockchain. Many companies are filing for blockchain patents, including Blockstream with their Liquid project funded by Axa VC. [Source]( 
So how is this any different?
I fail to see why people are grasping onto this point as if it's a big deal?
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:32:00

It can be easily discovered that CSW was lecturing at CSU and was definitely a PhD student there.
Just trying to identify exactly what the accusations are. If people are accusing CSW of falsely claiming to have a PhD, then I'd first like to find evidence of where he made those claims so that I can base my investigations on fact rather than hearsay.

If you want an answer, you will need to search deeper.
You can take the easy road and point out that I didn't answer the question. I concede that I didn't. Let's just get it out of the way now.
But really. What do you think? I would consider the following:
* Is there really a monopoly? Think carefully about this and consider the scaling stalemate.
* Is it really centralised? What was the cause of non progress in the scaling debate? What options have been given for the miners to vote on thus far?

But isn't it normal to list the years of study, as opposed to the year you were awarded? I mean Linkedin actually asks Time Period From Year, To Year

Don't assume that I think the same as you. I don't. I also value the well-being of others, not just myself and my family.

Most people who talk about how big their dick is, have their wife telling their best friend's wife behind closed doors about the disappointingly tiny cashew in her husband's pants.

Absolutely agree on all points.
Basically, it will take a *lot* of money.
I suspect the big players like Intel, AMD, TSMC, Samsung, etc. are waiting to see if Bitcoin survives as the ROI will take time. Basically the manufacturer needs to also make mining a part of its core business model to be profitable.

I think you may have missed the real purpose of my OP. I was sick of reading countless shitposts about Jihan, and wanted to point out to the broader community what I perceive to be the actual problem.
Is the solution incredibly complex? Hell yes. Have many people tried? Yes of course. Doesn't change the point though.
I think we mostly agree here. I just disagreed with your statement that using an Asian Contract Manufacturer = clones and disaster. If you manage things properly, it doesn't necessarily.

I'm afraid you are arguing with Satoshi himself there:


valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

Never heard of Karbon and I suspect the people shilling it here are part of a pump and dump group. That's how they work. They buy a cheap coin, then go all over reddit, facebook groups, etc, shilling their coin of the week, wait till the price goes up, then dump it and leave everyone holding a sack of potatoes. 
That's why asking a question like this will never get a decent response. 
Besides, noone can predict the future.
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:07:31
The statement before the question is flawed and I wouldn't justify it with a response.
If there was a centralised group of miners there would have been no scaling debate.
I'll assume from your bias that you think miners = Jihan. Do you really give Jihan that much credit that he caused the scaling stalemate singlehandedly?
Jihan just capitalised on greed. People bought his product because it was the best, even though they knew who they were funding. And he used that to strengthen his hand.

The point is, you don't need to worry what I think. Just worry about what you think and we can work positively towards a common goal.

None of anything you stated has anything to do with geography.
There are many American and European design houses successfully using CM's in Taiwan and Asia. The company I work for is one of them. We design chips (company, not me, I personally have nothing to do with our chip design process) as part of our products in Japan and UK and TSMC is our CM.

The capital needed is monumental to do it properly. A startup would have very little chance of competing IMO. You need experienced silicon designers with existing relationships with the big fab houses in order to release a superior product as Rev 1. And if you launch an inferior product, you wasted all your money.

Please do because if that's all there is, you've got to admit it's pretty thin.
In my research, I've read O'Hagan's article in full twice. He never quotes CW as saying he has any qualification in it at all. The only mention of it is,


And O'Hagans article paints a picture of Wright that is hesitant and shunning of praise and recognition. Further, O'Hagan spent six months in Wright's pocket as an unpaid, unbiased independent journalist searching for a story. And he has never concluded Wright was a 'scammer' or a 'fraud'. In fact although O'Hagan cannot say for sure, he thinks it is most likely that Wright is actually Satoshi.
Next is a video where he says 'a couple of Doctorates'. It is something but doesn't really hold up as damning evidence. Current evidence supports Wright had finished his PhD research and submitted his thesis in 2014. The video is from 2015. His first doctorate is in Theology (very surprisingly).
The conversation link says exactly:


* Charles Sturt University, Master of Information Systems Security
* Charles Sturt University, Master of Network and Systems Admin
* Charles Sturt University, Master of Management IT
* University of Newcastle, Master in Statistics
* Northumbria University, Masters in Law
Like I said. Very thin evidence to try and convict somebody. And using your reference of O'Hagan who spent half a year on the case and came up with no conclusions, it makes it even weaker.

The only way this shitty deadlock, of which neither side is innocent, will be resolved is if the value of BTC crashes.

People here wonder why others don't take bitcoin seriously, but it's cool or accepted, or I don't know what, to talk about forecast predictions by saying MOON at every chance.

At a glance, it seems like it would be much better to just hard fork and get the carnage over now, so everybody can move on.
It almost seems inevitable that at some point Bitcoin is going to come crashing down because of all this. It's difficult to imagine a scenario that plays out any other way :(

About a week ago I was given advice here that it could be unsafe to move BTC around on August 1 due to the possibility of replay attacks.
So basically, setting up a node now does nothing (aside from helping the network in general), and even after August 1 it does nothing unless you have an active wallet on the node?
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:11:45
I think you're going to kick yourself that you badly mis-timed this move. Heading towards August 1, many weak hands will sell BTC and buy ETH. Look at the charts this year. Every time BTC goes down, ETH goes up and vica versa. The only thing I'm not certain of is how low BTC will go and how quickly it will recover after August 1. Wouldn't surprise me to see 1100 again. I'm not saying I think it will go so low, but it would not surprise me if it did.

Mining is not worth doing unless you invest millions into a factory full of mining hardware these days. With one computer you will make cents.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:07:28
Yeah, that's called a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:52:52
More than 20 blocks bigger than any block BTC has ever mined in the last 8 hours would suggest not.
Mining fees only skyrocket when the blocksize is inadequate relative to the transaction demand, forcing users into a fee auction to get their transaction processed, resulting in users having to outbid each other to move up the queue.
If you have 100 people stranded on a desert island and only 90 bottles of water, and you decide to auction the water to the highest bidders, how much is a bottle of water worth?
Downvote all you like. The evidence is there.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:04:01
And you have to put those funds into the channel in advance. So if you have a recurring $20 monthly bill, you need to put at least 100 bucks into it plus $40 in fees to make it (kinda) worthwhile.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:03:31
Zero is pretty absolute. What if they don't drop to zero and everybody wants to open a channel? How is everybody's transaction going to get into a block?
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:52:47


What? It has nothing to do with the number of transactions.
x = y + 1 is a problem where x is the number of transactions and y is the network transaction capacity.
The value of the x variable does not affect the equation.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:06:35
How can they pour into it when you need to make an on chain transaction to open a channel?
Assuming all the regular transactions drop to zero, because everybody wants to use lightning instead, how much do you think you will need to put the fee to get your channel opening TX into a block?
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:42:35
I personally would hate to see BTC fail. It would be a disaster for the whole crypto space. I am worried because this whole LN concept seems flawed in many aspects, and not entirely well thought through.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:34:46


BTC has less **capacity** than demand. Capacity being bottlenecked at 1MB blocksize.
Fees are high as a result.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:02:43
So now you see how this:


is flawed logic.
First "no-one" implies x is zero, which is incorrect. Second, as we've agreed above, the number of transactions is not the key variable.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:10:59
Not as a high fee store of value it won't.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:19:14

I am not spreading any kind of misinformation, I am asking questions.
I am asking them because I read other people stating that this might be a problem and instead of just accepting it as fact, I went to both communities with QUESTIONS.
And I figure r/bitcoin is the best place to get information about LN, especially because BTC proponents actually have a motivation to give me a reasonable answer, as opposed to the myriad of pathetic trolls that come out of the woodwork on the uncensored sub.
Aside from your nonsensical, false and pathetic bullshit that came after it, I thank you for your answer regardless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:05:35
For any noobs that are confused:
When BTC tests a new high and drops it's a consolidation.
When BCH does it, it's a pump and dump.

Thank you for being the first person to actually give a reasonable answer.

Oil money. lol
The UAE is in the middle of its toughest year since 2008.
Price of oil has crashed and the country introduced VAT at the beginning of the year.
Real estate has fallen through the floor, businesses are closing and western expats are leaving Dubai in droves.
Yeah it's still interesting that UAE is adopting blockchain, but this has nothing to do with 'oil money' coming into BTC

Sorry but that's just plain wrong.
The term bcash was being used when Roger supported S2X. Roger only supported BCH *after* S2X failed.
Again, just use Reddit search to find all the evidence of this you need. r/btc was hounding Roger to declare support for BCH after S2X failed. Before that, he wasn't on board at all.

In fairness, a couple of points need to be corrected there.
The *Mt Gox is totally fine* video was not talking about BTC solvency. He was addressing the banking issues, that the community was concerned about at the time. At the time that video was made, nobody even dreamed that they were insolvent with regards to the amount of BTC they had. That all came out 7 months later. Watch [Kim Nilssons presentation]( note the dates the hacks occurred, the dates they were discovered, and note the date Roger made that video. You can also search this very subreddit and read the threads about the video and about MtGox to see for yourself how that all actually went down. Framing the video years later as something that was released just before Gox went down is either ill-informed - or just plain dishonest.
Secondly, if you're going to say that making a personal decision to refer to something as a different name is fraudulent, then you better make sure you are not doing the same thing yourself. If we are truly concerned about newcomers to the space getting the right info, then it applies equally to both sides. If you strongly believe that referring to BCH as Bitcoin is wrong, then it stands to reason that referring to it as bcash is equally wrong. You can't reasonably demand somebody to use a correct name, when you aren't doing it yourself. The term bcash was being used months before Roger gave support to BCH which, incidentally, only happened after the failure of S2X.
The same cognitive dissonance applies to the censorship, sockpuppets and shilling points.
Basically, the entire community on both sides, is a giant shit show.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:35:32
Yes, sure he did. He concluded it was run incompetently, and he was right.
But Ver's video isn't about that. It's about letting people know that he saw the fiat bank accounts of MtGox and that they had the balances that they claimed. No more, no less. And history shows that (at that time) they did. They just didn't have the BTC, which was even more disasterous!
Framing it 4 years later as something else is just wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:29:59
Just use simple search tools to find out that your assumption there is wildly incorrect.
The bcash moniker was used extensively on social media long before that event. Sure that event intensified it, but that does not take away from the fact that it was being pushed basically since the fork. 
No person interested in actual facts could argue that 'bcash' was a reactionary measure. It simply wasn't.
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:18:56
Your argument was "who said it first", not who said it the most.


People were using that name before he was even involved in BCH. So what you're saying is provably false.
Besides, saying it only picked up after Ver's rage quit doesn't even make any sense. Why would he be so pissed about it, if it wasn't being pushed and used en masse before that?
The fact is, BTC maximalists tried to remove the name Bitcoin from Bitcoin Cash months before Roger Ver even supported BCH.
Honestly, I don't understand why. If you are truly a Bitcoin Maximalist, you should understand that forks are just the way the network evolves. The strong survive (BTC/ BCH) and the weak die off (most of the other forks). This is good for the resilience and longevity of the Bitcoin blockchain, not bad. Having 2 surviving blockchains from the genesis block provides redundancy in case something goes wrong with either one.
