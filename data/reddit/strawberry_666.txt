Depends on your end goal. If you're into short term speculation, you better go with riskier altcoins. If you're in for the long term, sure thing it's a good time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:53:58
Check. I'm buying the shit out of the dip
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:30:30
Shiiiit :/

The only problem with stablecoins is that they share the same fundamental flaws that fiat has, namely they can be "printed" in enormous quantities out of thin air. The lawmakers do fear the stablecoins. It's been publically stated. As far as bending the laws of money laundering, there are still ways to enter ( and exit ) bitcoin and altcoins positions these days.
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:51:27
People will find a way to circumvent this shit anyway.
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:45:07
Sorry dude. The leeches already gave me a good rate. Let's talk in 10 years. I might buy your car for 0.0005 btc :D
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:20:19
This is good. That means all the good quality alts are on sale.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:30:44
You're right. A car is a huge rapidly depreciating liability that gobbles up money. I'm well aware of that. Therefor I never buy new cars, only well maintained used onse that have shaken off a majority of their "new car" price. That being said, I plan to get a decent large car so that it can be rented out during periods of calm. This way it will generate some cashflow that can go back into cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:44:46
Chinese scammers cashing out again?
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:03:10
Aside from the helpfuk tips here, I'd also recommend you get yourself a hardware wallet like a ledger or trezor. It's Extremely important for security reasons!!!
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:05:55
Best thing you can do is to find some side hussle that can bring you some extra cash. Use that income ( that is 100% separated from your ( and your family's ) finances to buy cryptocurrency. Daytrading is difficult ( but not impossible ), so it's easier to use fundamentals and good due diligence to enter into coins with good potential. Right now I'm all in in btc and decent privacy coins. Good luck man!
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:12:51
Good point man. And that is exactly the reason why alts aren't going anyway any time soon
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:16:51
Best way to cash out would be buying physical gold and selling gold for cash. This way you won't have any tail that can link cash to bitcoin. Good luck man.
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:50:36
Dude. In the name of all that's sacred and holy for fuck's sake please get your crypto off the exchange if you plan to store it for a period that's longer than 1 day. A hardware wallet will be the best purchase you'll make. If you want to know how important it is, I just gave 1 to my mom for her birthday. She has some LTC and she's a total noob in everything crypto-related. So yeah it's important.
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:37:36
Why? Things like ETH and XMR do have a future.
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:19:24
I hold both btc and bch. There is place under the sun for both.
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:52:41
Understandable man. Maybe I'll just sell my alts during the next bull run :D
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:46:43
Thanks for the tip. I have some precious metals in case the shit hits the fan. I keep cryptocurrency ( especially alts ) as a speculative play for now. Btc is long term holding. It all boils down to spending btc on something useful that will also have the ability to generate cashflow.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:45:18
Very clear. Thank you for the explanation!
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:02:36
In short, yep!
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:02:31
Yeah it's a good point man. I've thought about it too. I do hodl some bitcoin ( and alts ) for a long term and am prepared to sit on them for more than a year if need be. The car would be an asset, since it would be rented out when not in use. Also since it won't be bought with credit, the running costs should be minimal. In the mean time I still plan to add to my positions during periods of corrections.
@_date: 2019-08-12 11:56:39
Valid point man. Thanks for mentioning. I've thought about it too. I made similar mistakes in the past and lost a shitload of purchasing power in Bitcoin over the years. However biting yourself in the ass all the time and regretting the past desissions is not really productive. I've learned and moved on.
@_date: 2019-08-11 12:21:22
It depends on income off course. For me a 20 to 30k euro's for a single purchase is a large amount
@_date: 2019-08-15 22:44:35
Trzor or Ledger. I'm sure there are others out there too. I use a ledger and very happy with it. It's an expense, but it's not as expensive as losing all your hodlings.
@_date: 2019-08-28 05:01:50
China can actually pull it off. The people there are very comfortable using electronic payment systems. In the EU people love cash and precious metals and share a healthy distrust towards the banking system. In general this is good news for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-23 17:22:14
I actually don't follow the markets and prices that much. I'm mining some coins and in spare time read books about Bitcoin and blockchain tech. It's important to have long term goals. 
And if you want to have a piece of mind, be prepared to lose everything. It's still a risky market!
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:15:16
Had the same problem with my mom and dad. After a lot of persuation and after showing some of my bitcoin gains in tangeable form ( cash and precious metals ) my parents were convinced. My dad is mining cryptocurrency with me and my mom learns to operate her ledger nano x
@_date: 2019-08-11 11:04:05
Shouldn't be too difficult these days.
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:02:04
Asic miner here. The bitcoin mining algorythm ( sha-256 ) is very popular, but the problem is, there are huge industrial mining farms out there that focus only on mining bitcoin. I mine different coins and convert them to bitcoin. There is less competition. If you are not ready to invest some money in a small mining operation, I'd suggest you buy bitcoin in stead. It's a passive approach, but the way the global economy is goin, it's very good times for bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:36:46
try apmex, or private deals
@_date: 2019-08-11 13:05:17
Good point. Thanks. I actually used some crypto to pay for our downpayment on the house. It felt like the right thing to do, since a house is a necessary expense. With the car, I won't feel sorry if crypto moons. Kids are growing up and I need to replace my 2 seat cargo van with something family friendly. So eitherway I'm doing this. :)
@_date: 2019-08-11 16:04:49
You become vulnarable in the fact that the 3 letter organisation could tie your perdonal data to your wallet address. Therefor never KYC!
@_date: 2019-08-29 05:24:13
Man there will always be drops in BTC. Volatility is your friend. Right now however there is less volatility due to leverage trading. Over the long term the volatility will decrease and the markets will stabilise and become less chaotic. 
If anything, the name of the game is dollar cost average. Just buy small snippets of btc whenever you can. It helps to get yourself a side hussle or a small stream of income aside from your current job/business. This way you won't bite yourself in the ass during huge price drops. That's what I do. 
Regarding the news, don't worry about that too much. Sure you can read ccn, altcoin magazin and other sources, but remember to focus on fundamentals too. We're heading towards a new resession and there's no way to tell how cryto's will behave! So don't panic and dollar cost average your purchases with tiny amounts of money that you don't need immediately. Than sit back, relax, have a coffee and watch the freak show play out. Be cold blooded and calm. Good luck man!
Ps if you don't have a hardware wallet, don't even think of buying btc without one!!!!!!!
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:41:36
It's simple man. When you read tabloid newspapers and watch cesspool tv news that caters to non-investing audience and they say not to buy risky assets like bitcoin, than it's your time to buy. I did this in jan 2019 when I saw it on tv. Huge btc sign with a red cross on it. From that moment I started buying btc and good quality alts. 
When the same "news" sources are telling that btc is going through the roof and posting stories about another guy who sold his houce, truck, kidneys, ... to buy BTC, that's your sign to sell and get out of the market. Off course never sell ALL your holdings. Just what you need to sell at that moment in order to recover your invested capital. All the rest of the gains can just be left in the market. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:32:21
If I ever cash out my btc, it wwould be only 8n physical gold.
@_date: 2019-10-21 21:18:08
50 to 100 euro. Sometimes it's less
@_date: 2019-10-25 07:29:31
You don't need much man. Most important thing is you need the hunger and interest to learn. You can never know everything. I'd suggest a few decent books about Bitcoin. Maybe a few courses. 1 year of education will do
@_date: 2019-08-29 04:36:17
Did anyone pay 10000 btc for 2 pizzas recently?
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:15:45
Off course. I DCA a bit every month
@_date: 2019-10-20 18:45:48
If you want to sever ypur connection ( bitcoin to fiat ), what you can do is sell your bitcoin for physical gold. Be sure that you stick to non numismatic gold coins with weight of 5 to 10 grams. Than sell the gold coins for fiat. There will be fees involved, but you'll be able to erase the trail of your cryptocurrency to fiat transaction. Good luck
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:10:30
Fuck yeah man. +1 on that
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:17:19
This relates to the story of how a dude made his first bitcoin transaction. 10000 btc for 2 pizza's ( worth about 30 usd at the time )
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:15:57
Nope. Biting myself in the ass over such things is not productive. I focus on the future.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:42:57
Allow me to clarify. By normal people, I mean most working fols out there who trust the curent system too much. In my country ( Belgium ) we have negative interest on the savings accounts. One might think that people would purge their accounts as soon as possible, yet nobody is doing it. People just don't care about that sinister system that's slowly nibbling away at their hard earned pennies. So these people have a problem learning about Bitcoin and altcoins. For now this learning curve is a problem for mass adoption  That being said my current bullion dealers are all saying that these past few months the business has been booming! People who ARE purging their savings accounts all go into precious metals.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:30:14
Welcome to the club man! Remember to keep your asic clean and dust free. They love to gobble up dust and debris. Happy mining!
@_date: 2019-09-01 10:38:50
Most likely no, but lots of BTC will be lost due to ignorance and lack of prudence when backing it up. This is a big deal in the Monero community by the way. XMR has inflation especially because of the potential of loss.
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:07:11
Tbh I'm not worried about cathing a bottom. It rarely works anyway. Dollar cost average is kinda safer and better for the state of mind. That being said, yeah I'm looking to buy some BTC later this week. :)
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:07:39
Right on man! Family is the toughest to convinse. I'm glad that my folks have come around. My dad mines amand hodls too at the moment :D
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:22:35
Dude. Seriously? I guess the only valid response would be: If you don't understand it, I don't have time to explain. Goodbye.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:20:57
To the Noom!
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:47:05
I won't stop working too. It's the safest way of living in a socialist sesspool that my country is becomming. No lambo's and expensive travel for me.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:56:28
My apologies. I thought that the explanation provided is suficient. *Link removed
@_date: 2019-09-25 13:05:15
Yeah man. It's a good idea to talk with the Misses about this. It's serious stuff. Good luck man.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:11:01
Dollar cost average is the key! Here's the thing: you can't know when to enter the markets. Bitcoin is too unpredictable. There's no point in biting your own toenails and trying to predict the market. If you're not sure when to buy, buy now.
@_date: 2019-09-01 15:06:13
There isn't man. Both systems are different and that's perfectly ok. While the limited amount of 21 million btc can be lost, there is a coin inflation ( extra coin printing of sort ) that happens with xmr ( and other projects like Dogecoin for example ). It's not better or worse. Just different.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:28:23
If something like that would to happen, we would all drown in a river of our own sewage faster than we could start worrying about our BTC hodlings.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:08:16
Look at open market cap in stead. It has no fake volumes.
@_date: 2019-09-23 05:13:29
You have a point there. About gold and silver, you see the learning curve regarding these assets is pretty straight forward. These things are easy to buy, sell and store ( in physical format ). From what I hear, the bullion dealers are having a very busy time at the moment. It takes a while before a normal person actually learns about Bitcoin, safe storage, private keys etc. So by the time it will become mainstream, the big players would have allready taken over. It's well formulated in the book about the Winklevoss twins. So even at 9k euro's bitcoin is still a buy.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:03:18
This is the best free advertising a man can get!

Nothing wrong with Fiat by the way. Their commercial vehicles are very well built and run for ages

I know man. As long as this healthcare system in the EU still exists, they should be fine. Both are working and they hold no illusions about the future
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:06:08
My goal is not to moon, but to have some assets that are outside of our curent financial system.
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:02:28
Mostly privacy coins, LTC and KMD.
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:48:30
+1 on that. Also expect volatility to dicrease over time. Bakkt is not good at all for BTC
@_date: 2019-09-18 05:01:41
Gold and cryptocurrency is one of the best combinations out there. It's a must have for every investor, since we're heading into an unstable economy.
@_date: 2019-09-15 13:05:12
Don't worry man. When the resession bites us all in the ass, your folks will start to learn about BTC asap. You'll see
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:32:25
True. But there are custodial services nowardays that can handle transport and storage. In general gold should be seen like non-rental real estate. It's very similar.
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:24:44
Can't shake the feeling that this launch won't be without trouble from the 3 and 4 letter agencies. :/
@_date: 2019-09-19 08:29:54
Yeah man. Seems like it
@_date: 2019-09-15 10:53:31
Both are excellent investments! Gold is free from all taxes and vat. It's your nr.1 anonymous asset that can help you during periods of money printing on steroids ( like now ). Bitcoin is also amazing, but it needs to prove itself during the next financial crisis.
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:00:37
Than you will have bought a bit less BTC. No big deal. It happens to everyone of us. Relax and have a coffee
