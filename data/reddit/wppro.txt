I'm a user of counterparty, and feel safe with it. It rides on top of the bitcoin blockchain, so as long as bitcoin is there, counterparty should be there too. The wallet interface is a bit jankie, but it does work and have always been able to make the transactions I want.
The known uses I know of are:
- Storj is using it to manage their tokens
- Let's Talk Bitcoin uses it to manage and distribute their tokens to users
- I have some tokens that represent shares of a website that offers advertising, kind of like crowdfunding the website owner. It pays back weekly dividends, via counterparty. (hasn't been profitable, but really cool use case imo)

This is lame and looks like phishing to try and hack some unsuspecting smucks. If I know your email and that you use bitcoin, you better hope all of your accounts have extremely strong passwords.
Anyone that knows anything about bitcoin knows there's more addresses than grains of sand. I hope your database has a lot of storage.
Even if it is legit, it will be absolutely impossible to manage and/or verify.

If you run across any tainted fiat notes, I'll be glad to take them off your hands. 90% of all bills have traces of cocaine/narcotics, your gonna need a huge database to track them all.

But his fart jokes smell the funniest!

I was joking. But it did take an long time between the crowdsale and launch.

I used this service for an eth crowdsale wallet I had forgotten the password ( I blame vitalik).  WRS was able to take the idea of what I had for my password and rescue my funds within an hour or two.   Quick responses too.  I hope I don't forget a password again, but if I do, I'll use WRS!

Well, they take personal doxing info and then don't give verification, I call that a scam. What would you call it?
There's not even a way to remove your information afterwards. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:04:25
oh wow man! it freakin worked! thanks so much for updating me!
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:08:35
Yeah, and basic doesn't work, SMS verification either. Now they are telling me to use Enhanced,  those scammers, and now my info is in their honeypot.

Mr McAfee, please stick to making funny videos on Youtube. You're much better at that.

Because if a coin is to have value, then they shouldn't be created from nothing, like all the current ICOs.  By counterparty burning btc to 'make' xcp, you know it does has some sort of value and that someone (creators) aren't just printing money out of thin air.
