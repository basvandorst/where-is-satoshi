We must start converting whole towns at a time.  No one is going to use it if it's just one shop in your town.

I disagree wholeheartedly.  I also think that people suggesting we not rush forward may have ulterior motives.  We MUST strike while the iron is hot if we want bitcoin to spread.

That's closed.  Try again.  
Also, it's painfully obvious you are just promoting this dog coin.

He seemed fine to me.  You guys need to get a grip.  He should have said, "A wire transfer takes 3-5 business days.  A bitcoin transfer takes a few seconds and you can choose to wait for confirmations if you like."

If I lose every dime I've ever had, I would still tell people bitcoin is the way to go. 
If you don't understand how money is currently created, you can't even intelligently comment on what bitcoin represents.
Bitcoin represents society's choice to move away from evil.  It's really that simple.

Did they decide to change the supply or something?  Did I miss that?  How do you pronounce it anyway is it like dog.  Like my dog won't take this shit?
When doge gets a fiat to doge exchange, I'll take them seriously.  Right now, like the dogs they are, they are just nipping at the heels of bitcoin.

What the hell are you talking about random.  Last I heard, it was indefinite at like a billion a year.  How many total coins will there be?

Point of sale is a common industry phrase.  It is unrelated to bitcoin.

Doge has an unlimited supply.  Also, the value is in SHARP decline.  If this keeps happening, you won't have many dogers left.
