You're not strictly wrong, but ramp up takes time and 7 years is nothing. I just returned to Bitcoin after a few years away, and EVERYTHING is more convenient and mature now. 
I think, though, we'll have to see what happens during the next major financial crisis. That's when Bitcoin will shine both in terms of value and adoption, IMO

I had an opportunity to buy bitcoin when they were less than a penny each.
It's made me much more keen to be an early adopter of all kinds of new things.

It gets used for legit international money transfer, too, especially in places where banking is weak or lacks integrity.  Hell, I'm living abroad right now and I use it on the regular.
And a lot of the "speculation" is just hedging of central bank mismanagement and so on, too.
A lot of the world has a lot of use cases for bitcoin.  I think that it has far less utility in the Anglosphere than it does in most of the world, so we tend to view it as a curiosity more than anything else.

Price is what you pay, value is what you get.
Bitcoin has never been more expensive, but given the ecosystem right now, it's hard to argue that it isn't the most valuable ever, too.
I'm staying in Taiwan right now. The largest convenience store chain here actually accepts Bitcoin as payment.

And the gold market is nothing compared to the forex market.  Bitcoin ain't nothin' yet.  Which is incredibly bullish.

1)  The major economies are overleveraged as fuck
2)  Monetary policy has stretched everyone thin
3)  When something goes wrong, fiscal stimulus OR a war on a cash with negative interest rates will be the only way out.
4)  Both of these will send bitcoin soaring.  Fiscal stimulus because of simple inflation, negative interest rates because of capital flight / the creation of a universal bubble.
In the case of countries that go in the negative interest rate direction, adoption will soar.

I own both gold and bitcoin, and I gotta say, I like bitcoin more.  Carrying gold through an airport is terrifying.

Given how uncorrelated Bitcoin is to other markets, it's an excellent safety hedge.

Yeah, this is why PoW alone is pretty scary.
With a PoW based model, control goes to whoever controls the semiconductor manufacturing plants and design facilities.  A state-level actor, especially China or the US, could compromise the network if they were intent on doing so.
OTOH, right now, I don't see any alternatives that are really quite as good.

The situation today is even more nuts.  The markets have had 6 consecutive quarters of real earnings decline, and the quarter before that was flat.  Yet we're at all time highs.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:03:23
Again, you're ignoring the core point of what a "hedge" is, and the source of the safety it provides.
Diversification = holding many uncorrelated risky assets = safety = hedging

Not gonna lie, I panic bought a little bit, but nothing I can't afford to laugh off/lose.
I'm probably just going to give away 20mbtc each to a few friends in exchange for them installing a wallet on their phone and backing it up to their email, get more people interested.

I think that you could "cash out" into an intermediary account at an online exchange, or use a card like this:
It has a Visa card interface, and can store money in both a currency (USD, Euro, or Pounds, determined when you order the card), and BTC.
So you can receive the money in BTC, convert it to USD, and then hit an ATM and get the local currency when you actually need to spend it.

Moving is hard.  I do live overseas now, in a somewhat less tyrannical place than before, but it took years to do, and I'm a fairly proactive and intelligent/resourceful person.  I can't imagine what it's like for a typical human being to try something like that.

I agree, but I suggest redirecting your thoughts along these lines:
"Fuck, I am so much better than him, God, my superiority feels GOOD."

Eh, I think it's sad to "sit around and wait", but I think that in general people don't change their habits until they are forced to by some circumstance, or they are flowing down the path of least resistance.
Bitcoin is unlikely to become the path of least resistance anytime soon.  However, circumstances will eventually force people out of the "default mode network" of their brains -- and many of those who "wake up" will adopt bitcoin.
Over time, the financial system which survives will be the one that is as convenient/powerful and robust as possible.  IE, they gain 'converts', benefit those 'converts', and don't self-implode.  Fiat currency systems are powerful, but generally aren't terribly robust, but they're good at gaining 'converts'.  Bitcoin is likely to last longer than most fiat currencies existing today unless another crypto outcompetes it.
So, the way I see it, the issue is just time.  It will likely never be a 'sole currency' given its deflationary nature etc, but it will probably be a pretty good and widespread safe haven, given how easy it is to obtain, hold, and use compared to the alternatives.

America taxes the poor less than just about any other developed country on Earth.  We have a more progressive tax system than all of Europe.
The people who pay the most taxes are the middle and upper-middle classes.  People who earn their income from labor, but who get paid a lot for their labor.  It's true, capital manages to avoid getting taxed quite often here, but so does cheap labor.

Maybe.  Once Trump gets in office, though?  And starts pushing through all the anti-remittance, anti-globalization regulations and so on?  I don't see that being anything but a tailwind.

It has some equity/store of value aspects.  I mean, there are 21 million -max- bitcoins.  We aren't necessarily looking to get rich "quick" so much as diversify into something with some utility (international transfer etc) that can't be inflated to oblivion.
I don't know, I'm not trying to get rich off of bitcoin, but it is part of my portfolio, I change my position over time based on the relative price of other stuff, and I also use it as a way of moving money from one country to another.  To me, it has proven to have a whole lot of utility.
I can't be alone in this regard.

Even in the worst case of a hacked exchange, the price only dropped very transiently.  That was back in April of this year.  Now, we're flirting with all-time highs in all currencies.
Name for me something that dropped 20% this year and is now at an all time high.  Basically nothing except Bitcoin.
And that's why it's valuable as a diversification tool.
Diversification, remember, means that you can decrease the total risk in a portfolio *by adding risky assets*, as long as those assets are uncorrelated.
Bitcoin has basically nothing to do with the traditional financial markets.  It's such a tiny drop in the bucket that even credit market hiccups likely wouldn't affect it nearly as much as sentiment amongst IT folk.
That, for now, is an excellent value case to an investor looking to reduce risk (add safety) by hedging.
@_date: 2016-12-28 00:43:38
So, this got me looking up hedging.  You are correct.  I was conflating it with diversification.They are distinct.  Hedging is more about finding inversely correlated assets that hopefully share some underlying causal reason for the inverse correlation.
I still maintain that bitcoin, as a diversifier, can reduce total portfolio risk, but it is not a hedge.
