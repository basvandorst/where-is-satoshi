Depends on how many confirmations you want to wait for. For buying a snack at a convenience store it's really not worth waiting more than one.

What's wrong with coinbase?

Yes, there is. There is a standard way to send bitcoin IRL with a QR code.

Pretty sure that sign is intended to be tongue-in-cheek. Also notice the American flag / eagle / assault rifle 'Murica' poster.

I used this same model of ATM at Bitcoin Decentral in Toronto a few weeks back and while it did technically work, frankly the entire user experience was crap. Utter crap.
Even just trying to figure out where to feed in bills was difficult since none of the slots are even labelled.The machine runs some kind of Linux distro and the touch screen was not very responsive (there was even an X11 cursor on the screen). Etc.
Right now bitcoin ATMs are so far behind commercial ATMs in robustness/quality I really don't think they should be rolled out at all until they are at a similar level to what people are used to. They feel like something a neckbeard cobbled together in his basement.

I can tell you right now the  problem is that you can't tell which slot is for the paper wallet printouts, which slot is for putting in a debit/credit card, and which slot is for cash.
Who thought it was a good idea not to label these?
They're also too far down. They're like two feet lower than the touchscreen.
It only takes like 20 seconds of observation of a commercial ATM to see how these things ought to be designed.

Can't wait for someone to post photos of Goodman's own home, car and registration plate, etc. I mean, it's already 'public', [right](

This would be a worthy ~~kickstarter~~ coinfunder project.

The problem with using something like monegraph is that I could just go and find an asset that isn't registered, register it under my identity, and then claim I own it.

With some kind of high-resolution scanner, similar to a medical imager, they probably can. NMR, X-Ray fluorescence, millimeter wave scanners, etc will eventually be cheap enough to use on everything.
Commercial shippers like Fedex already conduct random x-ray security scans on packages at their hubs. Just a matter of time before it gets more automated, routine, and subject to machine vision algorithms.

OK. Except that different 'dollar' currencies are usually not used together in the same place because they are different countries' currencies, whereas bitcoin and the Thai bhat may co-exist in Thailand at some point.
If for some reason Bitcoin had been invented in Thailand and was called Satoshi-coin and the symbol was '$', wouldn't you advocate using a more unique symbol?
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:51:59
Uh, what? Probably only because of the vertical line(s) in your country's currency (a dollar sign).
Most currency symbols don't have vertical lines, such as the pound (£), euro (€), rupee (₹), yen and yuan (¥), ruble (₽), won (₩)...that's about half the world's population right there.

You lack a basic understanding of physics if you think that faster-than-light information transmission is possible
