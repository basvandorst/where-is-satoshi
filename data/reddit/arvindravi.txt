The same thing happened to me with my small amount of bitcoins. I managed to move them to a paper wallet 0.1 at a time, surprisingly all the 0.1 transactions went through fine except the last one. So now i have 0.1 stuck on multibit, which I cannot spend, neither can I export its keys, like you've mentioned, nothing shows up. It maybe lesser than what you've got there, but hey who knows what 0.1 could be worth down the road? Anyway, I suggest you to try sending them 0.1 btc at a time, if the transaction doesn't get broadcasted and you don't see your coins, reset your blockchain, that helps.I tried contacting jim on github, and he asked me to export the keys, but when I told they weren't getting exported, his response was nothing. I hope they fix the bug before people start losing some serious money.

Well it depends from person to person, doesn't it? 
I have assumed the average sleeping time to be from 10pm to 6am. :)

With so many people getting rid of their iPhones for a droid, I'm thinking I should probably make a marketplace-sort-of to sell your iPhones for BTC. :D

Wow, I didn't know that. I'm an Indian btw. 
And about the video, its pretty exciting. As for now, the Rupee is getting weaker by the day, and its about time people had something as revolutionary as the Bitcoin to be used widely. If its gets the kind of attention it deserves in India, its totally a game changer.

Yes they have. There even was a Bitcoin [conference]( recently held in Bangalore. Though any big-time attention hasn't been given to it yet.

2. Paste "$(' without the quotes
3. Press Enter
4. Voila! Arvind is gone.

I came across this site a few days back, worth checking out:

Coinbase uses 2FA I believe. So even if the person has access to someone's account, I don't think he can do much with it.
Oh btw, the grammar, lol How would anyone fall for it?

This happened to me. Reset the blockchain and your coins should be back intact. Might take a couple of resets before it is back, this is an issue with Multibit for some reason. People have raised the same [issue]( more than once.
