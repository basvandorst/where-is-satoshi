I'd count it from the genesis block, but you're right, someone should host an event or something.

1. A stable option when you want to escape the volatility of the crypto market but don't want to exit into fiat
2. Encourages traditionalists to get involved in crypto safely
3. Cheaper to escape volatility: you can cash out of crypto without having to pay extortionate banking fees
4. Regarding the Winklevoss coin, it will be regulated and audited by several third party organisations
1. Not Decentralized: When pegged to fiat it's still essentially under the control of the central banks
2. As a result of not being decentralized, it is prone to manipulation

I completely agree, no matter how many times it's been kicked down, it not only bounces back, but comes back stronger! You're right we need to spread the word and continue to educate people about the freedom Bitcoin brings.

I love that Idea, I'd definitely attend! A great way to spread the word and encourage adoption, sounds like it'll be fun as well.
