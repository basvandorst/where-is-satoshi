I don't know. I don't work in the government's financial industry.
All I'm saying is that [upcoming regulations have been announced]( and will apparently come into force soon.

New regulations are coming in soon that will de-anonymise BitCoin transactions.
So there will be no tangible benefit over paying *online* with BitCoin vs a traditional bank transfer. Neither one will be anonymous.
And as I say - for "offline" payments, the best way to keep it anonymous will be to just use paper money. (Or, some other **physical** object of value.)

Know your customer ('KYC') is the process of a business identifying and verifying the identity of its clients.
I honest don't understand what you're saying. By my interpretation of the article (and many others like it), that's *exactly* what it means.
OK, it doesn't mean your name will be made *public* (I never said that!), but it does mean that the *Government*, for example, will be able to see who has made each transaction.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:23:35
Let's wait and see what the government does first, shall we? This is a very bold claim you're making, considering you don't actually know how governments will attempt to enforce KYC.

What can you buy with it? Who are you buying from?
Your options are much more limited than spending real money, and the seller is much more likely to deny your transactions if the market is fluctuating.
And, if all transactions become de-anonymised, you're not really free to "buy whatever you like" - since purchase of illegal items is traceable. (Unlike physical cash payments.)
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:15:59
That's a **good thing**!! The measure is there for your own safely and protection! Are you seriously telling me that you'd rather *not* have counter-fraud measures in place?
Besides, you can just phone them up, answer a few security questions and get the account unlocked. So it's not as if the withdrawal was being truly denied.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:19:15


Such controls can be put in place as an extreme measure, for the good of the economy. And even in such cases, *small* withdrawals are permitted; the thing being prevented is everyone withdrawing all their savings as cash and causing a financial crash.
The same thing could happen with BitCoin, but without regulation: Everyone tries to sell, and the crypto economy crashes.
(Oh, but wait... There *is* some loose form of regulation here - since platforms like CoinBase have halted all trading at critical times. So really, you've made a null point.)
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:46:12
And how is that a tangible benefit? What does this guarantee you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:00
I don't gamble. Bitcoin, at this point, is straight-up gambling.
I'm free to speculate without putting money on it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:03:02
When was the last time your bank denied withdrawing a **small** sum of money (and you had the funds)?
This is a totally contrived and irrelevant argument.
Besides, if the crypto market is massively fluctuating (like it is right now!), then it's more than likely that the *coffee shop* won't accept bitcoin as payment.

How is posting a link to another website's article exaggerating? You might accuse **them** of exaggerating, but don't accuse *me*.


Apparently not. Could you please explain how/why bitcoin transactions will continue to be legal and anonymous, despite upcoming regulations?


Not wanting to invest in something does not make me a chicken.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:13:34








Interest, security, services (e.g. online banking, ATM access, phone banking, anti-fraud monitoring, and so on).


Obviously not! But everything in life has risk. So that's a null point.
And the risks associated with holding a regulated currency are far slimmer than an unregulated one.

I think it would be responsible for *all* loan providers to - as much as possible - ban any form of *borrowing* for gambling.
Some people will have been thrown into $1000s of credit card debt as a result of this bitcoin madness, and I'm glad to see some regulations coming in to prevent vulnerable people from spending beyond their means.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:40:16


In what sense? If transactions are de-anonymised, I don't see any difference between trading BitCoin vs any other commodity.
Which brings be back to the original point: What's the value of BitCoin vs regular cash payments?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:58:32
So to clarify, you're saying there will be an easily accessible illegal backdoor, to continue anonymous trading? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:50:57
Do you know what else you can use to pay for coffee each morning, as an anonymous transaction?
Paper money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:57:51


Only the fact that I don't *want to* move to those countries? So I'm not interested in buying into it for that purpose!


That's some interesting speculation, but let's see how it plays out...
My prediction is that the USA (and most other developed counties) *will* regulate it, at least to the extent of AML/KYC regulations. Which is a good thing, as it prevents fraud and illegal purchases.
And when these regulations are in place, what's the *point* in using crypto currencies? They've lost their USP.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:15:37
Then you can make an anonymous payment **with cash**!!
...Besides, [new regulations]( are coming in soon that will de-anonymise BitCoin transactions. So buying with cash will be preferable.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:34:55
No. The bank has banned the use of **credit** cards, for this purchase. (In part for its own protection, as there is a perceived risk that people are spending money they can't afford on a collapsing pyramid scheme!)
There is nothing stoping you from using a **debit** card.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:30:50
You're missing the point... It will soon become a **legal requirement** for all crypto transactions to be de-anonymised in various countries, including the UK for example.
If these techniques work, then the currency becomes illegal. If they don't, then your point is irrelevant.
Cash payments, on the other hand, are obviously legal.
