Thanks for reply. 
I found seller on localbitcoins. He advised 'because im new account on localbitcoins, I cannot exchange messages' so we can make the transaction by text. He then confirmed the deal ( BTC amount, $ amount) by email, using the email he has registered with on localbitcoin.  Then recommended I create an account on localcoinbase for the transfer. Knowing nothing, I took his advice, only because he had 400 positive reviews, with the most recent being last month.

I got scammed out of 2, I deserve it more, screw this guy^^
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:18:53

@_date: 2017-02-21 18:53:49
sent money as a gift tho :/ dumb me.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:52:49
ok UPDATE, I did this anyways. Minutes after, seller finally messages me, saying you cancelled payment, which is why you didn't get BTC. So I say, 'I cancelled payment because its been TWO DAYS NOW since we made transaction, and you still have not sent me BTC. Oh and what about the money gram I sent you ? Its been almost 5 days since that transaction, and still no BTC in my wallet, you never kept your end of the bargain! and scammed me!'
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:56:09
Thank you sir. I agree about what he is. Stay tuned, will be posting entire conversation of my mistake, just trying to cut out my personal information, but all of his will be shown. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:08:34
localbitcoins wallet showing 0 btc anyways :( just checked
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:48:54
yeah guys... This is where I fucked up HUGE.. Both transactions, the $ didn't go to him, someone else, in another country...  he had me send him pictures of the receipts for confirmation. Once again.. I was 1 day new to bitcoin, wanting to have my 3 coins ASAP, and most importantly- the seller having 400+ positive ratings dating back to 2013, allowed me to trust him for this transaction. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:50:18
trade was never initiated on LBC, I found seller on LBC, and contacted him by his gmail. Before LBC and exchanging numbers, he had a post up on craigslist with his LBC profile. No trade request was ever opened, he used his LBC email address to email me the details of the trade (BTC amount, $ amount).  I will be naming him very soon. I opened a dispute on paypal as per someones advice here, and WOW OMG the seller started texting me saying you CANCELLED PAYMENT NO BTC FOR YOU, to which I reply, ITS BEEN 2 DAYS SINCE I SENT PAYMENT. YOUVE BEEN GIVEN PLENTY OF TIME AND SMS WARNINGS TO HOLD UP ON YOUR END OF BARGAIN....
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:03:11
wish I Knew this before, but was very anxious to obtain Bitcoin. I got his number from his craigslist post, he send me a link to his LBC profile which had his email address. Then he confirmed the profile by sending me an email. Im trying to post up the entire conversation today, stay tuned.
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:45:16
The conversation was attached when I created a ticket for fraud against the seller. the 400 positive trades since 2013 is why I completely trusted the seller.  Thanks for your input

@_date: 2017-02-23 12:56:33
lol, we learn from our mistakes.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:00:44
I did not buy on coinbase, because im STILL waiting on them to confirm my bank info... and because my max limit shows as 150$, im guessing this will go up when my bank account is confirmed. Will be posting the entire convo up as soon as I can remove my personal information.
@_date: 2017-02-23 13:04:27
its all making sense now, he said I cannot exchange messages on LBC because im new, and took advantage of the fact that I didn't double check this, I was so anxious to obtain bitcoin. Major lesson learned, will be posting entire convo soon. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:06:10
uhhhhhhhhhhhh what? 
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:53:23
sorry was typing fast lol. Found the seller with reviews on localbitcoins.com. Used coinbase for the wallet.
Does providing proof of entire convo earn me 2 BTC ? lol
@_date: 2017-02-21 19:06:31
ehhh, but I gave him the wallet address to my coinbase wallet for each transaction.... 
@_date: 2017-02-24 13:18:20

@_date: 2017-02-21 19:29:55
can upload pictures after work. The guy walked me through creating a coinbase account. Then had requested my coinbase wallet address when it was transaction time. Don't I need to give seller the wallet address in order to get the BTC ? Same thing happened when I purchased from ATM. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:51:16

thanks for reading, heres my fav part of this DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY!  "Blockchain technology makes possible new offerings in industries as diverse as financial services, health care, supply chain, oil and gas, retail, music, advertising, publishing, media, energy, government, and many others. In finance alone, it can be used for making international payments, trading stocks, bonds, and commodities, and providing an audit trail for regulators. It can create new forms of assets and make it possible to trade existing illiquid ones, such as mobile minutes, energy credits and frequent flyer miles. It can be used to track provenance, stamping out fraud and counterfeiting in areas such as luxury goods, fine art, pharmaceuticals, food, and government documents. It makes it possible for musicians, writers, and other artists to embed royalty payments into their MP3s, ebooks, and other creations to pay themselves every time their work is bought or resold. It can be used by publishers to run publications funded not by ads but by micropayments issued by readers' browsers. It can enable people to manage their identity and the privacy of their data instead of having to rely on centralized entities such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter. It can show an individual voter that their vote was counted correctly and the entire electorate that no votes were fraudulent or counted more than once. And those are just some examples."

@_date: 2017-03-07 12:56:07
not sure if correct, but the Chinese paused all withdrawals from exchanges on feb 13, and that ban got lifted overnight.. I think.
If correct, the traders probably sold for profits.

once we come to a resolution to the fork drama, im sure we can all expect all the money that recently has left BTC, to dump right back in, and alts to go down. I don't think it will be resolved in 2 weeks though, but I def seeing 1500 and higher once we hit that milestone! anyone agree/disagree? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 13:08:14
I wonder where we would be if all the money that was pulled out due to forking fears (last friday) and ETF denial, poured back into BTC, 2k?

Hey why does price drop affect miners ? Will they nit be profiting off fees at 600?
@_date: 2017-03-31 11:17:29
I think were set for a bull run this weekend: 
but no one is discussing this.. One would think a GOV officially accepting it as value would bring a lot of major players into the game. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 11:30:21
yeah, very interested. Do I purchase from the link you sent ?

I don't think any ATM accepts credit cards. please correct me if im wrong. (in USA)
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:59:32
exactly! While I could easily &amp; instantly send a small amount here in the US, there will be a fee lol. The problem is, for example I tried to buy a car over 10k the other week using my credit card, took 4 hours on the phone for them to remove the hold on my card and confirm the transaction after I swiped. Then took another week for the seller to get the full amount because 50% was put on hold by his bank. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:04:18
should have waited a day or 2? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:03:07
Bitcoin is here to exist, like the Internet, while making current services like debit cards and PayPal obsolete.
It cannot be uninvented or wished away by the establishment, central bankers, or governments. Bitcoin is far from perfect, as the mainstream media makes sure to express at a moment’s notice. It is not yet easily acquired, understood, or stored. Yet, these fifteen reasons should give us cause to invest our time, effort and resources into nurturing Bitcoin into becoming “The Future of Money.”
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:52:32
bull run this weekend ?

how often does the difficulty adjust ? Will this affect the amount of bitcoins mined every 10 minutes ( to take longer than 10 min)? 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:57:36
I think once the forking debate has come to a resolution we are all happy with, all that $ that went to alts will dump right back into BTC with more new users (because of the hype). Maybe we'll see 1500 per BTC at that point ? What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:34:10
LOL HUHH
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:26:24
wow good post, Ok lets ignore the market cap, If I sent you 100k (USD worth of BTC) through the blockchain, instead of doing it through the traditional banking system, don't you think that is disruptive ? As they lost my business for the transaction ? 
It seems like a great accomplishment to me no matter the current market cap at the time of transaction.

nice to know since I own the top 4 in your chart lol
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:46:36
dude, think about this for a second. when bitcoin is mainstream, you don't think new people are going to search bitcoin.com or be routed to bitcoin.com from searching bitcoin on search engines... owning bitcoin.com is a big deal has ALOT more influence than you think. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:37:15
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:27:23
seriously lol
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:57:13
In US, I recently bought a car with my credit card, (took about 5 calls to my bank and sellers bank, and about 4 hours of waiting) for the hold to be removed from my card, and payment to go through. Then, only half the payment cleared, and other half would take 2-3 business days.... Unfortunately he didn't accept BTC, but I sold him on the idea of how much easier the transaction could have been using BTC. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:28:44
annnnnnd the value is up to 1270 lol
