There is a button where you withdraw your funds from your lighting channel to an exchange. You can go further there and send it back to your wallet.
BlueWallet is working on that function to withdraw directly to our wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:52:41
Cannot download it in my country.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:09:43
Never tell anyone that you own Bitcoins...
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:39:20
Would you tell people that you own gold bars? ��
You maybe can speak about it, and educate people about it, but it's not necessary to tell them that you own it :)
Everyone can do whatever they want but I wouldn't do that
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:36:52
Then how safe is Trezor &amp; Ledger actually?
@_date: 2019-07-21 20:59:46
Yep... What to do.. just lets hope that BlueWallet releases it's update soon. ��
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:46:17
Every wallet which is listed overthere is 100% secure
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:59:29
Holy **** then Trezor is better....
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:14:28
I don't recommend Lighting labs app yet.
I lost 10$ of Bitcoin there just because of it's crashing.
I have screenshot the recovery seeds and still I cannot access to my money lol��
I would recommend BlueWallet or Eclair.
Wallet of Satoshi is as pain as f*ck
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:35:19
Bye Bye Bitstamp. Never again.
What about Coinbase Pro?
Is it ok with sending money over there and buying some BTC with minimi fees?
@_date: 2019-07-05 18:11:20
What if you send it to exchanges, they cannot be 100% sure that you still own it. What if you sold it there? If they would ask you��
Or you flip it through wallets...
@_date: 2018-05-01 11:50:34
Stop giving away your bitcoins. It's your own fault.

Guys, I cannot send some funds from the app wallet of Satoshi over to this new app from Lighting labs. Any1 knows why?
It's only 10$ lol

Stop looking at the price and start looking at the adjustments Bitcoin is going though. It gets more adopted for every day. Look at the LN and the nodes....
If you still cannot handle the bear market, then I recommend you to buy at the top next time :)
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:43:58
Satoshi cannot be alone. Maybe hal was one of the participants. Writing this alone is... Extremely unlikely.
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:12:13
Is it possible to withdraw to onchain from a lighting wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:09:21
Hodl ofcourse, why to exchange to something that is......
Tell me
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:25:29

That A**hol* looks as creepy as fuck.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:46:39
The sender used Wallet of Satoshi.
Reciever looks like Bluewallet.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:32:49
F*CK Fiat.
Never exchange your Bitcoins to the fake assets.

It's not the first time I use bitstamp, I have used Bitstamp over 10 times, always 24h until I get credited.
They got my money, and they STILL hasn't credited me.
Beware of this shit exchange guys 
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:35:52
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:43:14
How did you get that?
I don't have it in my GBoard.:(
@_date: 2019-02-11 12:55:26
$1,000,000 / BTC

I'm chilling. As I said, this is not the first time I'm using Bitstamp, the last times I used it, takes one bank day to reach my bitstamp account with SEPA transfer (EU)
Example I send Monday morning
Then my account would be credited Tuesday afternoon MAX.....
Well I don't care anymore, they sent me an message and said that they have get my money so..... Waiting to be credited.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:20:36
Yes there's recovery tool Everytime you create a new wallet
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:36:40
How do I get that?
I got one channel with 2.2€ capacity. It's in my new lighting labs app.
And I got 10$ in wallet of satoshi. How do I get inbound capacity on the LL wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:35:32

I still can't understand how people still use Coinbase.....
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:07:32
I'm using bitstamp and have used them for a while, i really recommend that exchange! Especially for europeeans like me ��

Guys, some inside info from BCrash.
Roger Virus is sacking some of his employees because of his shit coin is going through an pain season with the latest fork and the latest price....
What's next? Will he end up cashing out and run away from that ShitCoin? I hope so.
Beware of BCrash gentlemens, the bad guys down in Japan, Tokyo is going through shit right now and i'm enjoying it.
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:15:54
Why can't I find Cash App on Android Market?
@_date: 2019-01-01 17:02:53
No. Your lowest fee is Bitstamp. They charge you 0.2% and are better than CoinBase if you ask me.
I will never trust CoinBase after they listed BCrash without saying something. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:48:45
Thank you friend. Seems legit. I were here like sweating, keeps refreshing all the time thanks. Will remove this post now

Nakamoto? Is that..... You?
@_date: 2019-01-01 16:30:15
They are not. People who still buys from them are crazy.
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:27:30
Tell us! You have the chance now
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:10:20
I used Wallet of Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-01-26 23:17:18
Or.... Enter bitcoin.org/wallet 
Never use anything which is not recommended from that website ��
If you want to be 99.9% secure ��
@_date: 2019-01-23 15:49:18
You took my words. Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-01-23 21:52:56

Bitstamp is running great for me too. I hope they keeps the good job up!
Coinbase can go f*ck them self with their fees
@_date: 2019-01-21 01:41:27
Can you guys please stop posting trash from an trash site?
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:52:42
There is no "next big thing" in cryptos. We need to stop with that kind of bullsh*t. We rely on Bitcoin, and that's what we are going to do in the future. Stop lie to yourself, maybe you will make alot more money on some crappy altcoin but we still can't close our eyes on Bitcoin.
The next big thing is Bitcoin. Period.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:53:55
Absolutely. I'm only hungry for more bitcoins.

Hey guys! Some questions over here;
What happens when we reach at those network transactions levels in the future  like MasterCard &amp; Visa if Bitcoin is meant to be a payment tool?
Currently, it cannot be on the same level as those above, what's your opinions on this one?
Is Bitcoin going to a be "store of value" 
Or just an alternative payment money?
And the block confirmation time, if we are going to pay for a dish at an restaurant, you're like sitting there and waiting for confirmation for over a few minutes, that's not a good idea..
Yeah; I have heard about the LN, those channels which is needed to accept or receive bitcoins on LN... They are very complicated.... Or????
@_date: 2018-12-16 00:52:19
I recommend bitstamp. But not in paying with credit card. Use Bank transfer. Cheaper fees. Bitstamp charges 0.2%
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:24:31
Great!!! Gotta try this on my Woocomerce.

$3K is history now,
In a few months/years you will look back and said,
Why did I not buy when it were at $3K or $6k?
Remember, when you are afraid of buying low,
You do not deserve it.
Cheers!
