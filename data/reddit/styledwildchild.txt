Somehow I think he had a hard drive crash, and he lost them.  This would have occurred right around the time he dropped out of sight.

Why don't I ever see these posts suggest bitcoin is going to plummet or even dip a little?
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:02:58
I'll be the one to say it...
"yBitcoin | The Future of Money" and the rocket ship taking off... my immediate impression, if I'd seen it at some registration desk, would be to not bother taking it.  It had that vibe of "We're going to make you a lot of money if you buy our product!!"  Like something I'd see in the back of a magazine or on a late-night paid-advertisement.
I get that's not what you're up to, but that was the first thing that came to mind.

Yeah, it's still illegal to ship in the mail without authorization.  Postmaster General would have enough brains that if he got a letter about someone shipping cocaine, that he'd follow-up if they had the authority to so. 
Kim and his buddies all knew what they were doing was illegal and they were getting rich off it.

Yeah I don't like niggers, jews, and ragheads (both the Arab and Hindi kind).  Sikhs are cool in my book though.  
But I've rarely ever had good experience with members of those three groups.  No racism taught here, just learned from experience.  
But the difference between me and fatfuck, is that I don't scam people - including niggers, jews, and dotheads.  I don't like them, but I'd still try to be fair with them.  Sometimes.  
Sometimes not.  
Like one time this black guy interviewed for a job.  He reminded me of this other black guy who assaulted me once.  Guess who wasn't working at that company?
That's not really racist though.  If he was white and reminded me of some prick from grade-school, would it then be racist? Why is it racist only because his skin color ws diffrent.  That wasn't even really why I snupped him.  It was cuz he reminded me of some other piece of shit who looked and acted like him, who just happened to be black.  Sucks to be him I guess.  If both of them were white, I'd still ahve done it.  So... no racism. 
Anyhow, you act like you uncovered the watergate break-in.  No secret here, I'm a douchebag who speaks his mind.  Yay for hoping to be anonymous.

Holy shit, is this math so hard that you need to have somebody else do it for you?  


240000 / 150000 = $1.60, which is in line with what he has said he spends.  It's pretty easy to verify this, just go out and ask a few homeless people.  "Does this guy come around here 5 days a week and hand out a bunch of food?"  
150,000 meals 5 days a week for two years = 150,000 / (52*2*5) = Avg 288 meals a day.  Not impossible.
I guess my question is ... if he's doing this (and it would seem like a full time job) what money are he and his wife living off of?  If not the money from donations, are they financially well off enough that they aren't working, or do either of them have a job?  If he does have a job, how did he get the time-off to go running across country?
And before anyone accuses me of being a hater and joining in the hate fight, I'm not.  I kind of think he's on the up-and-up.  But as Reagan said: trust, but verify.
Let's say even if he is using some of he funds for expenses other than food for the homeless, I don't have any problem with this.  Administrative expenses for a charity are standard course of business, including compensating primary personnel for their time and effort.  So long as the majority of the funds are going to the intended recipients (and this is where better documentation would help him in the eyes of the public.)

Investing  $120M into something still doesn't guarantee a hit.  Think of how many movies that were made for over a hundred million that were complete box-office failures: Jupiter Ascending, Pluto Nash, Lone Ranger, John Carter, Mars Needs Moms, RIPD... all come to mind.  Some of those films had some serious pedigree and talent behind them.  
Before there was Iron Man and The Avengers, Marvel and Lucas pissed away a fuck ton of money on Howard The Duck.  And don't forget how painful the first Punisher was.

I don't think he is actually asking.  I haven't seen the video, but I'll surmise cryptotraveler gleaned a objectivist philosophy in what the speaker said.

I'm sorry, but without any information about what 21 actually is yet, I'll withhold my judgment.  I'm old enough to have heard shit like this before enough times to "believe it when I see it."

Well, no.  Dotcom needs to be tried first to determine if he was indeed guilty of breaking the law.  If he is, then anyone who lost money due to him (for conducting legal transactions that could not be honored due to dotcom and MU being shut down due to the legal issues) would have a legitimate legal claim to a reimbursement by Dotcom.  Not the government.

I wish there was a subreddit or something and ban this crap from here.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:56:03
I like how people try to excuse his morally bankruptcy to ignorance.  Any reasonable person would have had an ethical problem with talking up a stock so that it jumps and then cashing out at the expense of other people who believed your bullshit.
Dotcom is a fucking prick.  I wish the Internet would stop believing his bullshit.

No, I just hate this fat fuck.  I've followed him through the years, and he's just a sociopathic lying piece of shit. For some reason the Internet gobbles his shit up, like he's Jim Jones and this is Jonestown.

She could have researched a little bit to find that its possible to immediately exchange for another currency.
That makes her a stupid broad.

Because if you're doing business with a resident of the U.S., then the U.S. can claim jurisdiction.  Granted, they aren't going to go after someone unless they felt it worthwhile.  But it's basically what they are doing with Kim Dotcom.  Although he was in NZ, because he was doing business with a hosting company in Virginia and providing payouts to and payments from U.S. citizens, the U.S. has legal jurisdiction.  If he sets foot in the country, he'll be arrested and charged.  
The hard part is getting his foot on U.S. soil.  Not.... of course ... because of any legal problem.  That's just a matter of time to sort out.  The problem is there's not a large enough oil tanker to carry his fat ass across the ocean.

I'm racist because some races are obviously different and I am willing to admit it instead of hiding behind ignorance?

But in this case, it did.  He bought a large share in the company.  Made an announcement about how he was going to turn it around and all this grandiose bullshit.  Then immediately dumped it.  
A lot of people lost money on that asshole buying a stock, talking it up, and then selling it to make a nice profit at the expense of other people believing him.  
I cannot understand why people don't see through this fatfuck as being the lying sociopath that he is.

Just a question here.  I own a car.  I use it to go to work.  I use it occasionally to pick up supplies for the office (i.e. I sometimes buy doughnuts on the way to the office).  I use it to take me to business meetings held off site.  I've been known at times to use this car in the transport of company employees to offsite meetings, usually everyday between the hours of noon and 1 pm where we discuss how much our co-workers suck dick.
Am I committing insurance fraud?  Do I need to insist the company buy the car from me and pay my insurance?

Fatfuck is nothing but a shifty sociopathic criminal.  The bitcoin economy is better off if it shuns him.  He want's to accept it and use it? Whatever.  But I certainly wouldn't give that fat fuck any press or consideration.  
It's not that he's even started to accept it.  He's getting press because he's 'considering' it.  That's because PayPal is dropping his ass.
Who the fuck cares.  Hey, I got a business and I'm considering accepting bitcoin.  Where the fuck is my front-page article?  (I've never even been convicted of a felony or have a nation trying to extradite my ass)
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:59:51
Some people are able to separate the message from the medium.  You're not willing to counter my points about him being a lying sociopathic fuck who will say anything he needs to in order to get what he wants, regardless of whom it harms, because you can't.  Because it is  true.
But instead you're worried that I called him a fatfuck.
Just say "I know your points are valid, but your words offend me."
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:18:09
Yes.  Just like that.  You have a perfect analogy there.  Keep up the good work Tex.
