It’s recommended to take coins you plan to hold long term off exchanges. This insures there will be no funny business if an exchange goes down/bankrupt/hacked. CB claims to be insured but that’s only USD, if they lose your coins you are SOL.

It is to some degree. We all want crypto to succeed (albeit with slightly different picks for top coin), and don’t want to see people ruin their lives by betting more than they can afford. It is also self-serving though - holding prevents the price from dropping further and reduces the value of everyone’s blockfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:52:58
Everyone wants a dip then when it comes people get scared to buy in.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:06
I disagree. In a volatile market with plenty of short term ups and downs you can stagger your buy orders on dips to average down your overall buy cost. If it’s trading around $15-16k, instead of buying in 100% at 15.3 or w/e current market price is, put 10-20% orders at 15.3, 15.2, 15.1, etc. 
Last night BTC was 13.7 when I went to sleep, but I bought all the way down to 130001 overnight and thus my average was much lower than 13.7
The only scenario that doesn’t work is if it runs upwards and NEVER comes back down.

Buy when the price drops, don’t panic when it drops further, just buy more. It will go back up. Try to keep emotions out of your decision-making.
Limit Orders are useful since market changes 24/7. That’s like posting a note saying “I will buy .01 at $15k” and then if/when price gets to that point t automatically buys it for you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:14:59
Coinbase sucks use Gemini. Way lower fees and limit orders. Takes awhile to get approved so apply now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:32:39
That’s hoping it drops below 10k.

Mine goes something like this:
“It’s the most popular  ‘cryptocurrency’, which is a form of digital money that is kept on a ‘blockchain’ which is like an online accounting book doublechecked by a network of people all over the world. It’s not tied to the USD or any other country’s currency, but people use it to send and receive money in cheap/secure/private transactions. Many people also expect it to increase in value as more people and companies start using the technology. You can buy and sell it on ‘exchanges’ and store it in an app called a ‘wallet’.
I try not to touch the mining thing at all. If they are interested I plug Gemini exchange because I hate Coinbase, and expand a little more on the wallet and recovery phrase importance.
If I wasn’t getting up for work in 6 hours I would type up some easy answers/rebuttals to common questions/criticisms. I wonder if there is a simplified explanation/rebuttal document in the Community Info for this sub.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:59:29
Properly losing your shit involves selling all ur coins in the midst of a big dip, hate/posting other crypto subreddits and blaming it all on random tweeters (if that’s a word) and 3rd party entities.

Yeah a similar smart contract platform based out of China, with a couple differences. A big one is that it generates GAS when you hold it, which I gather you can use to pay tx fees. Seems like a solid idea, but I’m not an expert by any means.

I think “healthy” is subjective, but when I see extreme rapid gains I get nervous so don’t mind when they cool off a little. And yeah I think “unhealthy” would be &gt;50%, which would push a lot of new investors out of the market in a panic sell and hurt long term adoption with bad press. The media loves trashing BTC and can’t wait for a crash.

That problem is very recent and should hopefully be resolved with widespread Segwit and LN. it worked fine for years but now since it is blown up fees and unconfirmed tx’s are out of control, but that’s not necessarily something you want to dive in to on a simplified explanation.

@_date: 2017-12-28 15:49:15
For me personally, over $10 is a problem. But that doesn’t mean a permanent one. Only time will tell, if they can’t fix it BTC will continue to lose market share - but if they do the reliability and brand trust they have will keep them on top
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:38
There are plenty of pretty graphs out there, but honestly man I would get on an exchange that lets you post limit orders like Gemini. When the price sinks put a bunch in and ride the wave down.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:32:25
Nice! I think those were smart buys.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:08:29
I’m not much of a statistician, but if even if the price goes up and then comes back down you are still buying in at increasingly lower price points. You end up with more crypto for less $.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:18:02
I feel like they go hand-in-hand. The news of an idiot who bet his entire life on BTC and got rich (6) would be news that you should filter out (5).

I believe it would fall under Long-term Capital Gains since it was over one year, and yes cost basis would be on the day it was mined. However, he could also write off his electric bill and computer cost.

Yeah I tend to get caught up in the price movements and trading and forget what it’s about sometimes. Your faith in Bitcoin was also refreshing, I’ve only been in this space for about a year and recently there is a lot of noise about Bitcoin, but it was BTC that originally introduced me to the crypto revolution and turned me on to this “crazy experiment”
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:36:14
I think maybe the missing piece is the phrase “cash settled”. Meaning it’s all contracts and cash, not BTC or stocks or anything.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:58:45
IOTA isn’t there yet to have crazy good soft/hardware. I run a Light Wallet on my PC, to my understanding the “official” one on their site is the only viable option (although they have a couple). It requires an 81-character seed you create, so doing a truly random seed is the safest way to secure them. The lack of user friendly wallets is part of why the price has been so low.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:38:53

Ok the actual secret code meaning is that there are 2021 hashrate bits before a block can be added to the chain, so miners often reference the 2021st hash as the “key” to unlocking the block and getting the pay out. Sort of like the game-winning 3-point shot right at the buzzer, except in this case it’s a 12.5 BTC reward.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:30:58
Wells Fargo offers (or offered) a card like that, it was promotional though. Something like 3% rewards applied as a credit to your WF mortgage principal. Almost got the card until I found out it was an introductory offer and reverted to standard 1% reward points after a year.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:44:16
No problem man, I hope it pays off, for the both of us. Out of all the crypto, IOTA is the one that I honestly “believe” in 100%. The tech, community, applications, etc could be used to really make a big impact. Short-term we are going to see a lot of volatility, but long term I believe they will take over.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:12:31
I think it’s hashtag 2021, meaning he won’t sell until that year.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:17:52
Yeah I would almost expect that to send the whole crypto market into a dive. The  currency successfully attacked (especially one with “Bitcoin” in the name) would hurt the public’s trust dramatically in the whole thing.

You can make short term gains, just buy the dips and sell the peaks. Watch the market for a few weeks so you get used to the flow and what is a "low price". I saw previous comments where u questioned the math. Think about it in terms of $ only, or chips at a casino.
Invest $1000 at price $2000 (.5 BTC)
Sell .5 BTC at price $2500 ($1250)
You now have $1250 in your exchange account, and can buy back in on the next dip with that higher amount (like winning a hand of blackjack and increasing your bet next round).
Invest $1250 at price $2000 (.625 BTC)
Sell .625 at price $2500 ($1562.50)
Just don't get scared and sell it off if it goes lower than what you bought in for, or get tempted by a run and buy in high.
You can set standing sell orders on Gemini and price alerts with the Coinbase app that help with keeping an eye on sudden spikes or drops.
That's kind of how I looked at it, I invested $1500 and turned it into almost $2000 cash. Then I used half of that to buy ETH because it looked like I could potentially earn more with a lower priced coin, and I'm still in the red. So yeah it's always a gamble but it's entertaining. 
This is kind of a funky time to be buying into the BTC market with all the fork drama next week though. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:49:54
I got wrecked. Made about 20% BTC profit just buying/selling that and moved half my funds to ETH @ 300. Now I'm stuck hodling that.
