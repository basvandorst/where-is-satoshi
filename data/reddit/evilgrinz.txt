They have regular meetings, you can read the minutes. They are focused on developing the tech, and not caring about reddit price arguements.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:02:26
They are getting rid of anonymous accounts, which is good for everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:20:07
they are still pricing spreads, and you can't depend matching the market that quickly, the exchanges have plenty of lag hiccups
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:16:45
What are you wanting to track? All exchanges will show you price movements, and you can enter date ranges.

He is doing the bank thing, but from what I've heard they won't be able to service US customers. He is only going to be able to operate it outside the US... He registered the company in Cayman Islands, and is going to do a token sale.

course he does, he loves money more then anything

china changes their mind on bitcoin a couple times per week, people pay too much attention to them, they are slowly losing some of their grip
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:42:20
Its not that crazy to think down the road that centralized exchanges might have to delist certain coins, because of those features. It's a scary thought, but regulation brings a pretty mixed bag.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:02:53
who knows, if the price drops enough, people will start buying
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:09:50
This is probably the dumbest thing I've heard on r/bitcoin or even the whole of reddit!
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:47:39
you should msg these guys and tell them
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:32:55
Not if you want to avoid as many bugs/flaws as possible. There aren't that many software engineers even able to work on this stuff yet.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:33:29
thats how trade works
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:18:10
just keep talking about bitcoin, he enjoys using a blockchain to be a middleman...
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:00:57
I use binance, bitflyer gemini, coinbase/gdax, bittrex, probably a few others. Don't have a preference, except purchase fee's on coinbase stink, but you can buy on the gdax side for cheap. Depending on where you are in the US, your about to able to use robinhood also. Sending from any of them, they are gonna overcharge, but thats pretty standard.

According to the financial authorities, banks and virtual money traders on the 23rd, six banks including Nonghyup Bank, Shinhan Bank and Shinhan Bank, which are providing virtual currency exchanges and virtual accounts, Start. 
"The six banks are planning to open the system at the same time," said an official from the banks and virtual currency exchanges.

Every BlackRock exec from Larry Fink on down parrots that. They still have a lot of sway, and if they say something different that has a big effect.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:12:12
It keeps kicking scaling down the road without fixing the issues with blockchain scaling, they don't scale well. The reduction of bytes per transaction wouldn't ever happen with just blocksize increases. Basic blocksize increases will still happen, but Segwit, Schnorr, LN, and a bunch of other things we probably don't even know about are all needed to truly scale bitcoin. LN is in open beta, and hopefully starts to kick in before we actually get mass adoption.

@_date: 2018-01-08 16:45:29
Its probably not total BS, they want the money to continue to enter the country just not exit. China has a massive debt problem just like the US. They like the part where Bitcoin is mined and sold, but not the part where people can hide and move money outside the country.

A group of people disagreed with consensus rules, and wanted to create a split. It will keep happening, bitcoin has had tons of chainsplits no one even knows about. The bcash marketing is only skindeep though, they still need the bitcoin developers to create software. Just ignore the trolling, because thats all it is.

@_date: 2018-01-29 18:23:50
Bitcoin continues to push out protocol upgrades to help with decentralization, and the narrative from companies like coinbase is essentially Bitcoin is bad because slow/expensive. TLDR they can't do that with Bitcoin, but probably another currency.

yup, the sell walls are always there though, its bots doing price step ups, they are always recalculating buys/sells
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:18:09
you mean they are actively working, not tweeting or shitposting on reddit
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:47:13
yup bitcoin just keeps on going, doesn't care

Bitcoin is trying to remove ideologies(political or other) from monetary policy making. To sum up the article. It's quite the clickbait title, but its critical of the silly book.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:31:08
pretty much
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:12:37
yep, better get off the internet while your at it
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:01:19
just in case there is a quick rise in price, or drop in price, you get lucky sometimes and sells/buys happen at prices you don't expect
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:26:39
The problem with price posts, is there are way too many shills on reddit now, both for and against bitcoin. Some of them are the same person, just swapping accounts. It gets away from tech discussion, try r/bitcoinmarkets for pure price.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:22:10
are you needing it converted automatically?

@_date: 2018-01-25 23:47:53
LN is in beta right now, things in bitcoin won't ever happen as fast as we want it to. The security of the network has to be maintained above the need for quick upgrades. Sometimes patience is its own reward.

that was a Q&amp;A
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:25:31
Are you mining bitcoin or an alt? Much more profitable to mine an alt and swap for btc
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:47:35
tiny transaction fee's that the retailer doesn't have to pay, its pretty fucking amazing
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:46:10
try mining pool hub with awesome miner, should be more profitable then minergate, easy to setup, doesn't require tons of mining knowledge

Bought a few bitcoin couple years ago, kept reading about how it works, still reading about how it works because the tech is amazing.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:17:44
thats how I view it also, a backup, potential way to spread out holdings more also.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:33:32
yup, i remember them pushing it, also saying Bitcoin is slow an expensive without explaining why.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:05:53
The bitcoin developers probably figured out 5 years ago, blockchains don't scale well with just blocksize increases. 1 gig blocks only allow about 3000 tsp per second, which would basicly make it non-competitive as a payment system. You have to scale it in every way possible.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:47:00
not sure how it sees peer's before it's fully sync'd, may not work up to that point
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:00:47
The LN network as it stands today is hard to use so idiots don't lose their money, its early beta and not meant for use beyond testing/early adopter hardcore users. If he is representing that LN will ALWAYS remain that way, then he has an agenda to push something else.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:09:59
Bitcoin miners will find ways to mine cheaper and more efficiently, and hopefully continue to push out old ways that are far more wasteful.

@_date: 2018-01-29 21:43:17
I was talking about Davos with someone today, we both came to the conclusion that as negative as the Bitcoin news was coming out. The % of Bitcoin owners at Davos vs normal population was probably higher.

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:31:51
yw, reddit isn't helping with the trolls, its just gonna get worse until people switch to other sites
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:13:03
Bitcoin works great, the tech is moving about as fast as it can. It's never gonna scale as fast as people want it to, because security, decentralization, and censorship resistance are the most important things. It's what creates the value, and giving up on those features will cause loss of value. The price fluctuations of day trading don't really matter if your thinking years down the road and just spending bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:29:52

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:06:59
thats pretty judgmental, maybe you should stop and reflect for awhile 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:48:44
No one can say, but I've purchased bitcoin at all prices levels, bought on run ups, and run downs. Lotta people in the same boat. Try to learn a lot more about how works, and why its amazing tech. You'll probably end up feeling a lot better.

yup gemini nice an cheap
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:48:48
Of course he does, and he has no problem trolling and messing the bitcoin community, instead of spending money to implement SW. A lot of businesses, like reddit, don't want to spend money on security because its bad for proft.

LN is a pretty complicated concept, but its fantastic for all the same reason bitcoin is security, censorship resistance, decentralization, but then adds cheap instant transactions. Its currently in open beta, and not ready for mass adoption. However a few weeks ago, LN on the mainet didn't exist. It's hard to be patient when everyone wants everything yesterday.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:21:28

If they think Bitcoin is purely a ponzi, then we can have a big debate on what investment isn't. Plenty of people confused bitconnect with bitcoin, these attitudes aren't that unusual. You have to consider generational differences between people also. Also, there isn't a single investment ever, where owners of that investment haven't told other people "invest your money here".

Thats pretty risky if you like your job, because the one contrarian opinion even if slight will probably make the news nowadays.
The informative isn't really negative, they "still" don't view it as an investable asset. Which is sorta giving them an out to change their mind. I've listened to all the BlackRock guys on Bloomberg for awhile, its nothing new on Bitcoin. I'm also not sure how much of their opinion is affected by them not being the "resellers" of the product.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:16:39

Fundamental unfixable ways huh? Really? Maybe you and the OP both need a class on bitcoin.
Quit acting like it has to be all this stuff right now, when Bitcoin is still being worked on and improved daily. It's never going to work? Are you from the future? Your no better then the morons you attack for being uninformed bitcoin shills.
Why would any Bank like Bitcoin? It's taking away the fee's they collect by the second. Banks aren't good or evil, people are. People run banks. People at Banks do plenty of shady shit, and fines get paid, and they continue on.

I've always maintained that things like bitcoin cash were more like pretend battles. The real fights were always ahead with opponents that have much bigger budgets and power. Fighting idiots that only copy code isn't the same thing as fighting a government for power over money.

Second, Bitcoin doesn't care what BCH does, and reddit has way too many trolls. R/btc has pumped several coins before, so it's best to be cautious. It's also disingenuous to run around promoting something as the real original Bitcoin, and then spew a ton of fact distortions.

Well the ultimate battle is bitcoin vs usd, and I think they can, but not in way that the people running usd will ever be happy.
It's hard to not own some bitcoin now, because you have to consider fiat currency now as an group together, and you want to have a hedge against the group(assuming alot of your equity is denominated by them). This just purely looking at it from an investment standpoint, which is not why I like btc.

Bitcoin attempts to not put people in positions of trust. Increasing block sizes would lead to far more centralization before anyone in the world really starts using it.

All exchange transactions are off chain, unless your using bisq, which has about 100 users. Exchanges use internal tokens that represent an accounts holding for each coin.

I think spreading out is a good idea. Some of them have specific use cases that work, but most of them only exist for profitable mining and trading against BTC. I own a few, nothing wrong with playing around.

sure we pretty much agree, but we do get a lot of stories coming out of places that are tied to old money, they have MSM influence that bitcoin doesn't(which is good) because bitcoin doesnt market itself
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:23:28
Possibly making it ambiguous enough that when someone ends up in court, some old Judge can do whatever he wants. I guess Bitcoiners are moving to Japan.

It's definately the case, most coinbase users don't know or care about Segwit. It's a priority for the rest of us, but not so much for Coinbase. I think as competition grows for brokers though its important to support updates. We aren't quite there yet.

@_date: 2018-09-16 22:10:53
It's the usual suspects from S2X, it's good to be very wary of them. The thing to be most concerned with is companies like Coinbase building a regulation moat. The thing to be most confident about, is that Bitcoin doesn't care what they do.

Roubini needs to think a little bit, in a world of escalating government deficits, leading to more and more debt. Where is the average non-wealthy person supposed to store wealth? There isn't much safe space for them, at least Bitcoin gives them some protection.

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:18:20
I just don't worry about it, protect yourself by moving out what you want to, to USD. I like having some of it left as an asset. I also keep up with my bookkeeping.
You can use Bitpay, and just have everything settle in USD. So you never even hold bitcoin, I'd rather have the option.

1. No, it creates even more distributed networks that work with Bitcoin.
2. No, would lead to increased useage
3. No, thats stupid, unless Blockstream is running the channel they won't collect from it.

@_date: 2017-12-15 21:49:59
Sorry, should have been more specific, its users that need to ask for Segwit support and choose wallets that support it. Average person on Coinbase has no idea what Segwit is, and that it would save them money on sends.

@_date: 2017-12-17 14:38:06
Np sorry for not being more specific, there are some altcoins that less powerful hardware can mine at a profit(what I do), I have mining pool hub auto exchange everything for bitcoin. Occassionally I might keep zcash, litecoin, or something, but mostly I exchange for bitcoin. There are bunch of step by step guides to do it, just do a reddit search. Its not hard, you should be able to figure it out in less then an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:43:15
you would need to deposit it over time, my idea would be arbitrage it into cheaper bitcoin from others
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:44:30
He can't because if he did, he would literally destroy all cryptos. The experiment will be over. You can't hijack the main currency on every exchange, now a commodity for futures contracts, etc. The immediate loss in confidence of investors in cryptos would be devastating, the same thing as a 51% attack against Bitcoin. Not to mention, he wouldn't get a cent from anyone outside of Jihan Wu, and their companies would be worthless overnight. This is just part of his endless troll stream. It's good to speak out against it, just don't buy into it.

Yeah its almost like they don't understand what they are trying to regulate.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:53:50

@_date: 2017-12-06 18:39:04
Super Bitcoin can do it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:24
You need someone on the other side of the contract to accept the counter party risk. So to short Bitcoin, you need someone that will take the opposite position. This isn't math in the sky.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:18:42
into or out of?
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:51:55
They want to highlight projects and help educate developers. Anyone can make a foundation just like this one. Bitcoin doesn't care.
@_date: 2018-09-16 14:54:16
of course its centralized...

Congrats man, and I think your good, its still way early with bitcoin.

I live in a DC suburb, I've read the post for 30 years. It's owned by Amazon now, and you just have to be careful with it. They are getting ready for their propaganda movie on Watergate to come out. Just because the Post use to be a place for facts and whistleblowing, doesn't mean it still is.

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:14:40
Banking and saving, repeat that over and over
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:29:39
I'm not even sure where to start, since Bitcoin is innovation for money. 
Money supply and debt go up constantly, and the majority of the world population always has less and less.
@_date: 2018-09-30 18:33:29
not caring because bitcoin does what it does, this is my fourth year holding also, but ive bought at ALL price levels

i guess we will see.... your already here
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:46:51
We had tiny fee's, and no one cared. People care because it's a store of value(investment whatever) now, and can add a ton of things going forward. Cheap quick txs sold to no one... Literally no one cared, until the store of value aspect started to kick in and make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:03:01
fudfag is a good one, I think it gain momentum and probably end up 20x other alt terms

maybe or maybe not, its gonna do different things all the time
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:56:37
Nothing, but bitcoin will still be bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't ask you or me to accept it's rules, and the new coin can't negotiate with it, because bitcoin can't negotiate.

I've been holding for the last couple years, no reason to stop. Bitcoin goes up, crashes, goes up again, crashes, etc. etc. etc. Day traders need the prices to drop, because they are selling.

they are the developers, nodes, users, and miners of their own coin, because they can afford it. It's the first celebrity coin/mega rich guy coin. People are stupid enough to buy tickets to Justin Bieber, they are definately stupid enough to buy a coin he creates.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:46:47
im just trolling rentseekers, if they actually care about decentralization and security, they wouldn't support a coin with the same amount of developers as chucky cheese tokens

My wife knows I have bitcoin, and now she checks the price more then I do, and its beyond annoying. She is talking to Mother in Law(evil person) about it. Who is non-stop telling my wife its a bubble, because she heard that on Fox News. My wife is annoying(but I love her), and we wouldn't have to talk more if not for bitcoin. So thanks a lot Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:34:51
The reasons dont matter, you are still deviating from you intial reasons for not using bitcoin while argueing that a more expensive network is better then a cheaper faster one. It's also odd that something that would reduce fee's for Bitcoin(segwit), is a reason to avoid Bitcoin. It doesn't really make sense in light of your intial problem with Bitcoin fee's.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:54:11

both, some exchanges charge higher fee's for fiat buys/sells then others, coinbase vs gemini or kraken, they all have deposit issues though
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:43:00
It's all right here, but you have to be open
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:47:45
gemini is US, a lot more oversite and auditing, both are garbage though

The internet was created to be free an open, you either have free an open competition amongst many providers by breaking up large telecoms or you dont allow them to throttle traffic. We don't have the protection of NN and we do have ISP monopolies in place. These telecoms lobbied against last mile access, so they don't have to compete with smaller telecoms. They aren't required to let them use infrascture that our tax dollars everywhere helped build out. It's fine if your against NN, but without it all we have is 3 telecom monopolies, built up by tons of M&amp;A, that control the connections to where we all live.
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:46:29
You can't hang your hat on rules and regulations, and then use opinion to make a decision. She is just pointing that out in a very detailed way. If they think Bitcoin is a sham, why not let the market figure that out.

trading requires alot of automation to really win, you need to have a plan, and run trading bots at multiple exchanges to play off price differences, not saying don't do it, just go in knowing
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:01:14
Litecoin is faster and cheaper then bcash, so that can't be the reason.
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:57:10
thats a different discussion, and doesn't belong in this sub.

Stop telling anyone you have some, just keep it hidden away. Store it in a good safe wallet, and leave it alone.
The sad part is this creates a black market for it, and will cause a price premium to happen.

It could go up, but it might go down, or up then down, or down then up. Up down, down up, followed by more of that. Then a different trend followed by a new trend, trending to a trend.

If you want to continue to have central authorities then keep doing everything through them. It's not a hard concept to grasp.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:03:08

switching up payment options should be easy, depending on what site software you use, magento for example is easy to add/delete features, you just replace coinbase with something else down the road
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:43:26
Sorry, I misread, taking a loan seems to risky. Just lower your contribution going forward, and re-allocate that too Bitcoin. I'm assuming everyone is going to say this.
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:40:52
Yeah, but they are doing an ICO....

Try Gemini just to get started, Gdax is good also

Negotiating down tax rates while leaving all the loopholes doesn't really simplify the tax code, but large Corporations run congress at this point anyways

I dont think they can keep up with technological improvements of producers with a lot more capital.
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:29:10
They are well capitalized and have a clear roadmap, we will see.

So much jealously an anger in this thread, Bitcoin is open to anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:51:55
We can still login, but no more using the platform. I had planned to scale back from Bitfinex anyways. Its due to US KYC rules, nothing we can do.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:45:38
@_date: 2018-09-10 20:41:26
It just gives him a platform to appeal to emotions, without answering a single question, constant use of strawman arguements to try and trick his opponent into taking the position, and then saying gotcha. I dont know why anyone bothers, it helps him more, its not like he is ever gonna agree to reason. Like the idea of everyone wanting to be able to run a bitcoin node, I mean how selfish of us.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:08:01
keep teaching people how to run nodes and be self sovereign with their money.

It wont be a happy co-existence, the more they inflate supply by overspending, the more bitcoin gains value against
@_date: 2018-08-20 13:08:42
Its not that useful, bitcoin is much easier to buy and hold directly. I don't think it does much.

@_date: 2018-08-30 17:28:21
It depends on how much bitcoin is an important amount to you. I can't decide what risk is ok for someone else, much better to avoid it altogether.
@_date: 2018-08-27 20:55:57
Its not a pump, its gonna be drama like a housewives reunion.
@_date: 2018-08-17 17:09:20
And if they did that, then they become worthless, their equipment is worthless, just pour gasoline on it and set it on fire. They can mine a blockchain no wants to take part in with a worthless token no one will ever trust. Oh wait they already do the last part...

Backed by declining oil production for 20 years now... They have no money to improve infrastructure. So they create new money run by the state that will have value? They only way this works is if foreign investors buy the currency, because Venezuela needs foreign money to flow into the country. The government doesn't recognize international property rights, so foreign investment stopped. They need money, they are doing a bad ICO for dummies.
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:26:22
they are all worthless second layer networks..

@_date: 2018-08-24 15:22:04
It just doesn't matter, maybe a little boost. It's not this great thing that adds value, its another thing built on top of bitcoin. Which is fine, build whatever on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:13:08
everyone should hold a little bitcoin, whatever amount they are comfortable with

@_date: 2018-08-20 19:48:31
The petro doesn't actually mean you own the oil... You aren't entitled to anything, they are literally telling you the token is worthless. It's a great example of a useless ICO, with no blockchain or anything else.
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:42:50
Who cares, according to the SEC, bitcoin market is manipulated, but not by the "right" people.

I think your missing my point, these guys want to own the backbone, the protocol itself. They might buy some in spite of the what they say sure. Far less of them are interested in a blockchain that is shared by everyone, and governed by consensus. Im sure we will see Berkshire Hathaway Coin or Blockchain at some point.

@_date: 2018-05-24 18:17:43
Yes, but compared to standard transaction fee's for other payments its very good. It's not where it needs to be, but it's not a fee margin that would allow a lot of payment processor to operate.

@_date: 2018-05-31 21:38:04
You can't really trust anything Jihan says, if he did this thing he is proposing, he'd destroy bitcoin and also himself. No one would ever trust Bitmain to mine anything, or any crypto they touch... You have to just follow the actions and not the words. He didn't build his company up to be worth billions, to then turn around and set it on fire. Im not saying he isn't crazy, anyone that trolls as much as he and Ver do are clearly crazy.
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:20:50
Your positing that miners would try to steal money, which would not only destroy what they mine but also themselves. And Bitcoin is fully backwards compatible.

yes, which exchange do you have an account on?
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:01:33

@_date: 2017-02-22 16:12:15
It's not a political view, I think he is an unstable moron. I wouldn't trust him with any sensitive information on anyone or anything. He reacts way to emotionally to everything.
@_date: 2017-02-10 15:54:28
It's fun to watch them fuck themselves. I'll be buying more it it drops to $900.

I hope they do, they will just screw themselves.

@_date: 2017-02-03 21:54:57
I want to thank you very much for the link. That was truly an entertaining read!
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:49:51
Can you show us a 60 min memorized speech, that doesn't contain tons of repetition.
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:28:16
If you buy and hold, who cares what they do. If you trade and your not using bots, you need to be very very good. Ultimately its in their best interest for prices to go up longterm. The bot thing isn't limited to bitcoin &amp; cryptos, its done with plenty of stocks/commodities.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:56:42
The price of BTC might plummet, we don't know for sure. Any largescale dumping of BTC probably hurts both coins. Because the average consumer is totally confused, and can't differentiate between the two. I'm assuming he realizes this, and is again just trolling.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:46:01
They have to at least be sanctioning it, or following it directly.
@_date: 2017-03-25 21:18:52
I've bought all over the map also.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:40:20
I missed the bottom of the dip....
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:16:56
yup, i just look at the last 30 day price average and then read the crazy sky falling stuff and it just doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:48:50
Yes, but what altcoin will Ver and Co pump next.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:29:28
Yeah go ahead and do something that causes both coins to be near worthless for a few years. Crashing BTC will cause anyone outside these reddit forums to fear both Bitcoins like the plague. Then try to convince some village idiot that he should then trust putting his money into something starting with the name Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:32:22
Selling coins off to harm the currency, to then boost an alternate version of that same currency. Why would a normal consumer use either coin...
Threats and extreme positions will just hurt all the currencies.
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:49:42
There is no reason to assume that a dramatically plummeting value of BTC would mean that BTU gains value.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:51:54
This whole thing is a scam to crash the value, so they can re-buy in at lower prices again.
@_date: 2017-03-27 17:47:55
Yup, a lot of holders will lose trust in it. Stupid people continue to follow liars I guess.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:16:28
I saw what you did there!
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:26:41
He is kinda like someone else that can't stop talking and tweeting, and then forgets about past positions. I just documented 2 recent youtube videos, where he confused arguements on transaction confirmation times.
@_date: 2017-03-31 13:32:42
Also possibly, if you want to give them more credit, a weird alternative just to get things moving along quicker.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:20:16
I'm glad, they can stop fighting with each other. Especially if it creates a race to the finish.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:39:14
By WP you mean wordpress right? I already run a magento site.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:22:14
Absolutely, that's why I hold a good bit.
Hopefully more people start to tune him out.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:07:20
One in particular...
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:12:32
So move everything to Eth and be happy with that.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:26:17
If they cause this event to occur, the currency will be worthless to anyone outside of these forums. Both coins, no one will trust either version as a place to store money or transact. That's why it's all just talk. If he causes a massive drop in value, how do you convince people to come back. It's just sillyness, both coins start with the name Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:33:44
He is a salesman, and right now he is selling chaos...
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:35:40
Yes because some Peasant in India is moving all his rupees to Eth, because Ver told him to.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:52:27
Everyone knows what his game is, let him play his games and waist his time and money. Everytime he talks less people pay attention.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:17:11
Then why tweet crazy stuff along with Ver, and instead behave like a professional and work with the community.
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:48:34
1. He just said on youtube a couple weeks ago that he doesn't care about confirmations.
2. We know altcoins are great, just switch to them already and go away.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:53:25
I can and do export my inventory to other sites, so I can do that. Was looking to go more direct also.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:51:07
Relax, what is the new bottom now? $1100? I read BTC a little and the sky is falling, yet Bitcoin just had its best month ever for price average. I wish the 2 sides would work together, but its mainly removing Ver and Wu.
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:38:54
I wish the sound level was higher for most of it, definately have to mess with my speakers.
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:57:52
Run your own node? Someone can tell you how, still trying to figure it out myself.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:17:55
That website is ridiculous, and he basicly agreed to nothing....
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:18:39
I like my keep key, but been thinking about another 1.
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:13:48
Won't these software issues require more money spent, and thus create a downward spiral unless someone decides to actually invest alot of money into it.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:27:04
It's pretty clear that the infrastucture changes threaten their position alot. Hopefully what's done is best for bitcoin and not necessarily anyone one person or group.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:30:59
That's what I keep telling them, but they come back and just repeat it again and again.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:40:54
That's a good deal though, I missed that point.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:28:19
Ignore the troll..
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:52:10
This whole thing is a scam to crash the value, so they can re-buy in at lower prices again.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:40:59
Nice grab!
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:19:42
Yup instead of measuring dick size.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:03:53
Serious question, how can I get on the email list for Ver's next altcoin? I need to know early as possible.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:51:43
bitpay has a magento plugin, so that's a way to get started quickly.
Any thoughts on them as Co?
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:30:59
thanks reading up up, i'll post more once I go through it all.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:32:23
Good stuff thanks, easy economics.
It's what everyone would do if they were in that position. Ver is clearly a trader also, and trying to accumulate more at lower prices. This is something I've posted a few times about. Just the simple game of accumulating more Coin at lower prices, then getting out of the way.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:25:54
Was the president and board stuff a joke? If not then it's pretty much a given.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:34:05
Im in for more, so im with you!
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:54:25
What, serious?
@_date: 2019-03-21 18:13:19
nothing is(altcoin) superior if its easier to track, fungibility is a big hurdle, being worked on constantly
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:56:06
Didn't Bitcoin just have its best month on price average?
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:17:29
No missed it, but I guessed your post was sarcasm? I just check the price few times a week, don't worry too much about day to day stuff. Also my post was total sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-03-31 15:21:23
Someone could potentially pay him for goods/services directly though.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:11:07
But he did share it... It's like Trump sharing stuff on twitter.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:27:33
It got overheated, and way too many people started buying without any idea what they were buying. Some sold at a loss, but pretty sure they will all come back at some point.
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:48:25
I didnt say that.... Im literally just discussing this idiot thinking that we need central planners telling us what to do, when it clearly doesn't work for the majority of the worlds population based on things like standard of living. He doesn't seem to have a clue how most of the world lives, and has all kinds of things forced on them because of a currency controlled by a country most of them aren't citizens of.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:50:16
This isn't a notice to start selling shares, just that development shouldn't be affected by regulations.
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:29:34
why not own both, pretty stupid to not own some bitcoin
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:41:36
Just need people like her to keep talking.
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:13:48
Just lol
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:21:23
shrug, buy some cheap miners
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:44:18
Im talking about tether FUD on reddit, rather not expand it outside that. It would be a waste of time for both of us. if you've been on this sub for years, you've seen this pop up before in waves.
@_date: 2018-10-21 21:45:49
Traders do way more with stocks, it's pretty addicting also.
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:06:13
yup exactly, no sacrifice at base layer, build whatever you want on top.
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:54:51
Its better if he just keeps talking.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:46:16
if you have bitcoin on exchanges your already trusting people to do what they say.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:39:42
The people we have to thank for coming regulation, Bitmain, Ver, and co.
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:16:46
yes I typed that.
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:45:40
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:29:45
I have no idea, this isn't a commonly used term in bitcoin. No one has more power then anyone else.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:40:03
That he(Roubini) really likes central banking, not being facetious. His feeling is that banks and governments won't work with money systems they can't control. Which is pretty strange, because most countries don't control USD, and they are forced to use it. I'm not sure if he is going to ever go on record and say he likes the "federal reserve" specifically, but you can kind of read that from him.
@_date: 2018-10-12 13:27:02
Its gonna happen when it happens, people can build stuff on top of bitcoin, no rush to get anything done.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:33:47
I can type stuff into a PC, so can you, its not illegal
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:55:18
im not dancing around anything... im telling you pretty directly that im gonna type stuff, and you can keep asking for me to give you something, but I won't.
@_date: 2018-10-12 17:11:51
yup, but this is your game, and sometimes you have to play by yourself
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:41:05
gotcha facts pop up a lot, this one is especially stupid considering all the things we literally just waste resources on, not even trying to produce something with it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 16:41:23
need to do a deep dive into how this stuff works, lots of posts on 51% attacks in the history here
@_date: 2018-10-21 21:48:45
Because people fucking love to print money, most of these violate the whole reason bitcoin exists.
Edit darnit OP is a troll.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:26:56
just as the US starts to tell normal retail investors we aren't allowed to anymore:(
@_date: 2018-10-12 16:33:17
hehe, reddit isn't a job, i dunno maybe for some
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:43:27
Matter of opinion and perspective. Some people may never know gold as an investable asset. Sure Bitcoin is a speculation, everything is though. It's up to you what you value.
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:43:01
Email the help desk
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:07:18
I would suggest coins with very very empty blocks, not bitcoin with half empty blocks.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:09:34
Bitcoin is working on everything, and people like Roubini are going to cling to any issue as if it will last forever. It's as if he doesn't know that any issue he brings up is known and being worked on. He is also very much aware that fixes can't happen fast, because of maintaining security and decentralization.
@_date: 2018-10-09 23:32:11
No incentive to ever do this unless you like destroying yourself in the process.
@_date: 2018-10-13 12:25:17
nobody wants this trust-less permission-less stuff.... /s
@_date: 2018-10-11 17:15:13
He lacks any kind of morality or empathy. His anwers amount to rich people control things and thats the way it is. They will take their cut, and shut up because that is way the world works.
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:13:40
doesn't work

There is always new waves of users that get sucked in.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:24:25
anyone able to explain what they patented?
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:29:30
im not defending Bitfinex, just saying we have a regular stream of people here that can somehow see the future...
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:24:52
Manipulating any investment is bad for the investment, until enough people learn to stop supporting that group, its going to keep happening. Also they will screw us all, if we end up with a bunch of regulation in place.
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:31:50
Governments won't coordinate with each other on any of this. Go ahead and try to tell someone else what to do, lots of people on reddit try that every day.
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:33:59
"To make it all work, users will need to deposit Bitcoins with BitGo in the first instance. Then, through use of a proof-of-reserve mechanism, WBTC is minted as an ERC20-backed token, working on a 1:1 ratio."
It's not pegged to shit. It's literally garbage.
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:08:30
They are allowed to, and it won't save them.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:11:29
trust vs trustless is one of the main reason bitcoin exists.
If you want to send small amount of money fast and cheap, that is what LN is for.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:33:36
Never has a solution for anything, rails against the system then says we need central management. 
"Fiat money is protected from debasement by central banks". His quote, the statistics say he very fucking wrong.
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:29:22
Sure, thats your thing, thats ok, its a platform for people to post on.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:34:34
Thanks to Bitpay for showing us what NOT to run.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:34:58
thats cheaper then credit cards, paypal, western union, bank transfer...
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:45:48
That's the same as any asset, what would happen if everyone sold all their gold at once. You know what people are willing to pay on each exchange to acquire it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:03:45
People are literally coming up with different uses for bitcoin and it's blockchain every day. That should blow anyones mind.
@_date: 2018-10-28 12:59:37
This is the poster child for "corporate shill"

He simulataneously takes the position LN won't work and or no one will adopt it, now massive adoption is problem...

well then fiat is like purgatory or something...

@_date: 2018-10-12 13:27:39
6 times at least to understand it
@_date: 2018-10-02 12:24:15
yup, the section of the world that can't bank, and needs a safe place to store value.
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:28:54
The mining pool isn't the issue as much as the pool mostly being one entity. With BCH its both problems, but that was literally the point of the whole project. Anytime a small minority of people make a fork or alt version of bitcoin, they run it. If you don't like the rules, you can fork off, just don't complain when no one follows.
The same miners still mostly mine BTC, because its far more profitable.
@_date: 2018-10-21 22:00:41
It's a shitshow here sometimes, but I'll never stop posting.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:48:22
Sorta, the US has run up way too much debt. We have rates rising and credit tightening, but the product of all that debt is way too concentrated. We also have tarrifs effects starting to kick in 1st quarter of 2019.
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:49:44
Luckily for you there are alternatives to migrate too. Especially for people that like government intervention.
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:32:08
Pretty much this, that website ugh. So many articles on there written with heavy slanted opinion. Most of the headlines are just clickbait.
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:50:09
It's good because also because it creates a much higher bottom now. It hit 900 and bounced.
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:23:20
We may move to adopt eating our own farts.
@_date: 2018-10-12 14:20:26
I didn't...
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:51:19
not really, its just another thing built on top of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-31 19:45:14
Also inflation in the US, it's coming, and it's going to send bitcoin up.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:07:18
i have about 10 of these open right now...

badass, good for them!
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:47:58
They absolutely do, but unethical behavior attracts alot more regulation.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:32:22
yup agreed
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:19:48
Not until the public understands it beyond the name, and digitial gold. The articles on websites don't even try to explain it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:00:55
This is expected because they can,  or your keys not your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-12 11:44:45
Just keep talking
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:11:00
lol, nice troll
@_date: 2018-10-06 16:31:09
bitcoin doesn't listen to morons.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:43:54
totally agree, i'd argue its hard not to own at least a little though
@_date: 2018-10-08 12:44:50
The internet is always right.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:51:01
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:39:28
Banning bitcoin how? Governments around the world coordinating against bitcoin? haha...
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:29:00
I said I wasn't gonna argue... dont read my posts, I don't think I've ever responded to anything you've written on another thread asking for information from you.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:25:58
keep trying, reddit is your job now
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:49:19
If you are affected by inflation, and know how it works. Then something that can counter its affects, and isn't controlled by the entities that have the most effect on global inflation.

@_date: 2018-10-22 14:18:31
yup:) .... some people gotta debate anything.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:51:42
haha pretty much, gimme an hour, then we are good
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:41:38
yeah but its offset by drop in volatilty from it being harder to run books
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:32:02
relax and hodl
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:27:00
sure, that applies to both of you, i dont trust anything on reddit, its reddit
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:28:07
Yes, but too a degree we all need to make some noise so people don't get tricked.
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:42:17
I went through my phase, doesn't everyone?
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:41:20
Its the center of everything.
@_date: 2017-08-30 16:05:22
Whatever he does with bitcoin will be "bigger" and "better" then anyone else:) He just won't give any details on what that entails.
@_date: 2017-01-28 14:02:12
Aren't they seperate things tho?
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:08:45
Lol it already bounced...
@_date: 2018-10-02 22:09:51
I did, have some bitcoin from most price levels
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:34:43
i didn't say any of that, maybe drop some of preconceived ideas
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:25:09
dont give it press...
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:25:19
its obvious that im not saying much of anything, and whatever you infer from that is on you
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:17:29
he doesn't say that
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:42:49
Monopoly money is at target etc
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:26:15
yup, doesn't mean it will happen, but price and hashrate generally move together over longterm
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:06:13
Educate yourself, read their posts....
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:08:40
Stuff is gonna happen, dont buy into all the drama. Alot of it is just talk.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:01:25
Go back a few years
@_date: 2018-10-09 02:51:20
Lol bitcoin is now an exchange 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:06:00
No one uses it for anything, most txs are off the network. It has zero use outside of trading on exchanges, which is all off network.
@_date: 2018-10-28 15:41:45
Doesn't work like that
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:36:52
Dont time it, buy in set intervals, dont buy all at once. If you want to time dips, your going to need alot of time to watch it...
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:52:58
Bickering period number 8000, gives everyone a period of time to accumulate more before the next price bump.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:05:37
The great thing about BTC is everyone gets to help decide.
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:18:57
no one is gonna invest, doesn't matter where they go for funding...
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:16:38
Wow sexy!
@_date: 2018-10-17 19:10:18
Nope just more people getting more educated, banking the unbanked is pretty amazing.
@_date: 2018-10-21 00:00:51
He wants attention, is trying to provoke it.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:22:10
Its not an attack.... they do it to support a false narrative, but its their right to do it. Just spread the word, and don't support them.
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:56:26
I dunno seems like a commerical for the blockchain...

keep goin guys, all btc knockoffs must go
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:20:35
hehe, yes some people are trying to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:06:54
Why even bother with bitcoin? If trust and security don't matter, there are plenty of altcoins with cheaper fees because no one uses them.
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:26:06
You should set all this stuff up ahead of time, or use local bitcoins...
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:49:10
if you can't see it, lotta choices, not sure why your here
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:41:22
trust vs trustless.... unless your expecting miners to mine blocks for free.
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:40:15
Dude dont feed it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:35:54
You can't argue with evidence, it's pretty clearly designed to drive up txs fees. While they whine about high fees and slow txs, that they are causing.
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:10:12
Cost average over time, is what I always recommend. Price goes up you buy on regular intervals, price goes down you also buy.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:18:53
what does that mean, pro-blockchain, could be pro-bullshit.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:46:50
Giving Ver press to say more crazy trolling stuff, he's a pro politician.
@_date: 2018-10-03 15:00:39
Watch it go up, pass it on to kids. I wont ever cash out all of it, that is hodling. That is what some of us have done for years, and will continue to do.
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:18:59
Shorting something that ends up being worthless is pretty fucking dumb.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:07:08
He is a troll, if he trolls a 1000 more times, people are still going to take the bait. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 17:06:29
Bitcoin can't sacrifice security to achieve faster results. While everything else has virtually no security compared to Bitcoin, it depends on how much that security is worth to someone. It also requires a great deal of understanding how this stuff works.
@_date: 2018-10-11 20:25:18
How does he feel about inflation impact on people with little to no savings? I have a lot of questions for him about central planning, and why he hates real open markets. Does he think we shouldn't be able to think for ourselves? Him and Elon Musk having a baby soon? These dipshits talk about freedom as if its actually some kind of commodity, and some of us don't actually deserve it.
@_date: 2018-10-10 13:03:17
Price talk is pretty boring, it's the same trolls. They've been doing it for years.
@_date: 2018-10-12 21:15:21
I host one, they are great, love talking to people at them, lots of fun and just great discussions.
@_date: 2018-10-25 17:13:08
pretty easy to ignore it though, especially if you have no use for it

@_date: 2017-08-29 18:21:36
No its not because none of those other legacy payments have any of the features of btc.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:01:58
At they very least they are saying the exact same thing as Bitpay, just from the opposite viewpoint.
@_date: 2017-01-07 13:53:30
Transactions are still rising, I wouldn't worry. I think we are looking at a much higher basement now also.

@_date: 2017-08-07 12:08:47
Im not taking a position whether exchanges are good or bad, just the idea that all txs should be on one chain. While ignoring the fact that the majority of them have been offchain for years now.

Good call, also inflation is coming to the USD, especially if Trump adds tarif's to some imports.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:09:28
I have had to learn this lesson a few times also, im not in a position where I can sit and watch price movements though. I gave up on trying to trade and watch the price. The hourly price swings of bitcoin are big, and you will drive yourself nuts watching it. As the price goes higher, those swings will continue to be big dollar amounts, they will get bigger(less % but more in fiat).
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:34:51
I used to love my keep key...
@_date: 2018-10-10 12:17:02
the cost of doing it, will end up being far more then what is calculated, and at the time they team up to do this the price of bitcoin would be far higher, along with the cost to attack, getting more expensive by the second as mining power is purchased
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:23:29
shop around for better fees.
@_date: 2018-10-09 12:27:31

@_date: 2017-08-01 13:56:28
They basicly stop talking to each other, because they think others nodes aren't running the right software. I think that sort of ELI5s, need someone more technical to explain.

trying to have good open discussions and this what happens a lot on reddit
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:38:09
pullbacks happen, just the eb and flow.
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:29:00
He's right the bottom is way way higher now, transactions way up. The top end value will fluctuate alot, but the average value is way higher.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:09:41
Segwit is good, Polo is having severe growing pains right now because they have too many users and not enough staff to support them.
If your interested, cost average in over time. Don't buy all at once, price might dip then you can buy some, price might go up. We don't know.
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:35:37
haha, no one can tell you what to do with your bitcoin...

Securities fraud regulation is going to hit bitcoin at some point, and then the twitter social media stuff will be a problem for Bitmain, Ver, and Co. The more they post, the more likely that reality becomes.
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:08:36
Its probably a combo, they are definately still taking advantage of Asicboost. They are also doing everything they can to try to manipulate Bitcoin to adopt the protocols they want. When we end up with annoying securities regulation, we know who to thank.

Goldman would very much like this to play out so they can buy a massive amount of coin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:40:20
Thats more than the median or average, there is a chart that breaks down coin ownership by amounts, hopefully someone can dig it up. It should make you feel better. I own more, but I've been buying at regular intervals for years now. Slow and steady is the way I do it, don't worry about what others are doing.

Miners aren't going to mine bitcoin blocks for free, and we shouldn't expect them too. It's the safest most secure chain by far, and that security should cost a little more. It's still cheaper then any traditional way to send money.

@_date: 2017-08-24 19:19:16
Exactly, Institutional money is also waiting for less blatant market manipulation. When we end up with regulation, we will have Bitmain to thank. Although I doubt anyone will see it that way.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:56:08
have it confirm as fast possible
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:20:52
No its not, but everyone needs to stay vocal about what is going on. If we end up regulated everywhere on earth, then that will be the fault of Jihan/Ver.

Its sounds really good too the disaffected, but its just talk and no substance. They mostly post likely roger, appealing to emotion. He stays away from almost any kind of technical debate. Constantly accusing people that disagree with him of not being users, which is IMO a pretty big veiled insult(very childish). I've tried to stay neutral, but its really really hard.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:41:44
Hopefully we'd all continue to try and bank the unbanked, continue on the mission, like a bunch of oldschool bitcoiners have continued to do. Some have cashed out and become scammers/ICOs promoters, but that is gonna happen, because we are all in this for different reasons.

@_date: 2017-08-29 12:30:00
If watching the price is a problem, don't watch the price. It's 24/7 fluctuation, can be hundreds of dollars per hour. It's like crack for addicted traders, don't ever trade.... As the price goes higher, so will dollar fluctuations. If you have other longterm holdings, treat it like that, buy it and forget about it. I don't pay attention to the price of it, because im longterm hodling. I've seen a ton of peaks and valleys already, so the movement doesn't affect me as much now. Experience with it helps, but not watching price movement is really a good idea, especially at work...

 First, no one is hiding this stuff, second there are tons of people you can talk to about this. If that is a big portion of your Bitcoin stack, that was really irresponsible. Don't burn bridges with people that you need help from. The state of LN is honest when your talking to devs, if your reckless with beta software that includes storing value, don't do it again.

Definately going up, but with inflation also.
The thing to keep in mind, is we see alot of herding with investments. It's going to swing to bitcoin at some point. Gold is viewed as a place to park your cash, not make money, which is what makes bitcoin attractive also.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:06:18

Yup probably, supply inflation is picking up, prior to Bitcoin existing there wasn't a counter to it.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:35:18

Not surprising, your not leaving your money sitting in that bank, they don't like it. Your money loses value/inflation, they can't loan it out for free.

Just don't watch the price too much if your buying it for the longterm.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:46:31
its not realistic right now, but who knows what happens with inflation, which is a big part of why bitcoin is so great

I dunno, usually in the US traditionally stocks slow down on holidays(profit taking). Bitcoin is different tho, because it doesn't sleep. Yes day trading is always stupid, unless it is literally your fulltime job. Can't be said enough. The problem is people always thinking they can beat the odds, just like gambling addiction.

Fee's go up partially based on the value of satoshi/kb. It's pretty disingenuous to tell people that fee's will remain static, when they literally can't. He can't even acknowledge that point. There are some reasonable arguements for/against blocksize increase, we all debate it all the time.

Litecoin was designed for super fast TXs, it can be a store of value, it's a decent coin and basicly just a copy of Bitcoin.  It has value as a live testing ground for Bitcoin. I've held LTC on and off, so I think it's good.
Eth is different, it's really designed for business use, not meant as a store of value and for p2p TXs. It's probably a good coin, and something for a Bitcoin hedge. It's not the unchangeable rock that Bitcoin is because it's centrally governed. I've owned it, alot more cautious with holding it longterm. I trust Ethereum alot more then the people running Bcash or the S2X fork, because at least the Eth people don't pump out tons of fake information.

yes, but not at the expense of buying some now, like if its a choice to do one or the other, I would always buy sooner then later. I like the slow steady returns of mining, but in some cases I made mistakes by purchasing too much equipment instead of just buying bitcoin.

Find a bitcoin meetup in your area and go to it, Bitcoiners are super helpful. There are tons of great youtube videos also, World Crypto Network, Andreas Antonopoulus, bunch of others.
I have a diversified portfolio as well, and as much as I want to put everything into bitcoin, I don't. I took some of my fund contributions, and do set intervals which I think coinbase has setup. I also watch for price drops of more then say 5%, and buy chunks then. When there are pullbacks you will see crazy posting here, but if you can control your emotions that is the time.

I'm not looking to get into a debate with a first time poster about whether the whole system is broken and pointless... There is tons of stuff to read here or in various books on bitcoin. If they come here and start attacking our intelligence(lightbulb dimmer). Are they really looking to have a discussion?

Sure there is still an element of trust, but that isn't really the point of the whole facade.

Have you researched any of the coming solutions, or are you under the impression big blocks are the only answer?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:18:43
Userbase grows daily, you can do whatever you want with your coin. Not sure why any bitcoiner would support someone buying or selling Bitcoin based on a bubble article in wall street journal. Since it's basicly representing it as a bad investment, and doesn't even care about the exchange part.

We will always need a decentralized immutable currency, doesn't matter if crypto dollar comes along.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:24:19
Its very volatile, buy what your comfortable with losing or not, and strap in. If big volatility swings don't bother you, then you will probably like this. Read as much as you can, don't listen to anyone. Andreas Antonopoulus is a great source on youtube, watch a bunch of his videos.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:25:39
Why would anyone pushing bcash care what bitcoin does.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:41:28
Its undervalued in a world full of massive government debt with no solution to it, because the largest economies aren't growing except by inflation.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:40:32
We need alt growth, better for the whole market to grow some. I mine altcoins to trade for bitcoin, mining hasn't been very good for awhile.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:09:37
mining is legit, its a slow way to gain bitcoin over time, works pretty well, just make sure your electricity costs are cheap
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:26:13
As a small business owner, I gladly accept bitcoin. I don't want to sacrifice security tomorrow, for cheaper txs today. I accept it both online and in person, and we have for some time now. It's not just about cheaper faster txs now, its about developing solutions going forward.

Yes, in block weight, but that would require max useage of Segwit, which is still gaining volume.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:53:29
How many users does the NYA represent? Isn't this decentralized? Why aren't we talking about the gradual effects of Segwit, and a potential timeframe for size adjustments. Instead of fighting about Bitcoin being broken. I won't stop posting, I do meetups in person. I'm not anonymous, a s2x person is welcome to come, but so far I haven't met one face to face.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:11:01
What's clear is that there really wasn't any intention for this fork to happen. We can't prove it, but there was no way this was ever intended to replace bitcoin. The goal is just price manipulation again and again.

@_date: 2017-11-06 18:22:21
Mine altcoins and swap them for btc, the only way to profitably mine btc unless you mine on a massive scale.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:50:47
If s2x wins, cryptos are done for awhile, no one is gonna trust miners setting rules and mining, even miners can't be that stupid, but they still want to try

not sure, regulations for these exchanges are probably gonna get worse now
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:14:09
I dont think you grasp complex thought
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:15:10
Sacrificing security tomorrow for quick payoffs today, you have to really wonder if they want to kill cryptos. Also, its hard to take bcash too seriously when almost no one is working on it. Bitcoin has 100s of millions of man hours and dollars in it, with ten times that coming. Is this just a scheme before bitcoin securities regulations happen in most countries. Not something we all want, but the shenanigans definately raise the likelihood.

No that is 1 of 10000 issues.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:54:36
Just to add if bitcoin ever gets some type of securties regulation, this will all be considered fraud. This group is definately committing ethical crime, but it may end it being legal down the road.

1. Not to sacrifice network centralization for a bandaid fix that is only needed because of txn spam.
2. Linear scaling is not a solution to our transaction issues, and the people pushing it know that.
3. The compromise is an illusion, because most of this is pumping assets, then flipping them before the market moves.
4. Don't rip off open source work and expect people to roll over for you.(im just a rando, but someone taking advantage of others peoples HARD work is pretty fucked up)

Yes but where are they going with bcash? Who is going to work on it? What scaling solutions will be developed for it. It sounds good being faster and cheaper in the vaccum of right now, but that ignores every other factor that is part of bitcoin cash.

Because bigger blocks don't mean transactions travel faster, just that a block can hold more. That is other solutions. It doesn't make sense, they don't travel faster.

They can hold large amounts, but its still a decentralized network. There is and will always be market manipulation, and its probably the case now until bitcoin becomes less volatile. It happens every day on wall street, bitcoin is no different.

Ok, but isn't more money being invested in the space now then at anytime ever? Also, we know there are economic incentives on both sides. I'm just trying to understand the economics to paint Core as the devil. Blockstream gets alot of hate, along with Bitmain, but there are other companies in play also. Ver owns or is invested in a bunch, which one of his companies gains the most by a block increase now?
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:05:46

I believe Patent issues are huge problem with respect to AsicBoost. Unless I'm missing something, Bitmain can use it inside China at will(they own the patent). I'm not sure anyone else outside China can, without licensing tech that is not available for license right now. Bitmain offered to license it yesterday, but they don't own the patent outside China.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:28:48
Also buying alot of ad impressions on this forum. I think there is plenty of money behind both sides.

It screws over user nodes in the short term, while not doing anything to speed up confirmations.
@_date: 2017-04-24 18:21:29
Why are people investing so much more development hours into one side of this? It's both a question and rhetorical.

Not really, believe he supports Segwit, and wants to see techinical arguements from miners why it shouldn't go forward.
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:33:48
Just saying things are bad but not explaining why, isn't a great way to make your point. It's the whole transactions are taking to long arguement again, without getting into the specifics of why.

thats all you want to buy?
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:29:42
Decentralization is only good, because it means bitcoin is not under the direction of one person or group. It does create alot of debate on which paths to take. For instance the BU proposal calls for a board with a President, deciding on direction and protocol. Thus centralizing bitcoin decisions greatly into one small group. Some of the people involved believe the community can't make good decisions themselves, they see a need for large holding and mining interests to be the strongest concern. It's up to you what you think is better, there is far more technical information supporting the Segwit side though.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:00:26
Was the fix ready and just not deployed? It was rolled out fast.

@_date: 2017-04-08 19:18:04
That was my point, that changes everything about the current patent issues. The people outside China(patent rights owners), aren't looking to license it most likely because of the issues you detailed. As long as they(bitmain) can stall the current situation though, the more they profit.
@_date: 2017-04-25 20:16:36

We have higher resistance points now, I wouldn't watch prices daily, maybe weekly dunno. Most here are hodlers, so we aren't interested in prices going down.
Segwit is trying to reduce transactions size, creating room for more transactions in each block. It's really IMO just 1 part on the scaling path.

No one in this arguement is, facts are still facts.
@_date: 2017-04-07 13:58:09

Also what happens to the equipment using this outside China? Does it touch on patent infringement. It has the potential to turn into a massive legal battle.

Causing minor currency fluctuations with his tweets, best to just not try to figure them out.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:26:38
It's ok, it is voluntary 
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:12:56
This fraud affected so many people, there isn't anything beyond shutting them down that would be justice.
@_date: 2018-11-11 21:33:45
The platform is far far less secure, they added a coin with a backdoor for the government.
@_date: 2017-04-20 18:00:51
Buy the FUD, literally buy BTC now. Be greedy when others are fearful.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:10:45
@_date: 2018-11-08 00:11:10
Yup, but they make themselves look bad in doing it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:21:36
thats fine, but its a waste of time
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:39:40
The selective policing of crypto stuff is pretty hilarious within the broader context of what they still do advertise. Bitcoin doesn't care, Bitcoin doesn't pay for ads.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:09:30
thanks, can't wait to mess with it
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:51:23
yeah how is that gonna work.... spend a fortune trying to enforce it.
@_date: 2018-11-04 17:20:31
Who cares, its insecure junk...
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:55:29
Yeah im just looking at a ratio that is cited a hundred times a day by economists, and considering average cost of living going up, rapid concentration of wealth, middle class reduction.
@_date: 2018-11-02 04:13:55
I do both, but yes its better
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:46:20
He has tried, CSW isn't gonna respond.
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:14:56
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:23:57
oh god....
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:53:27
your talking to me, im just pointing out he's a troll...
@_date: 2018-11-12 13:59:08
Ah yes banning code, if that happens everything is fucked anyway 
@_date: 2017-04-10 15:14:48
That is the whole point of his post....
@_date: 2017-04-30 14:39:27
Almost all are on the record saying blocksize increase is part of the roadmap. How do you give a firm date on when anything will happen with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:12:41
Don't be so obvious...
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:49:09
It's a bit weird, no approx ship date. They could give q2 or q3 2019 even.
@_date: 2018-03-30 17:32:57
thats how I always view it, but always trade cautiously
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:05:47
ok so just stocks calling themselves cryptos
@_date: 2018-11-12 16:21:21
You were able to earn BTC opening leveraged shorts, if you felt the price was going down.
Couple ideas, mine on a graphics card, earn $1 in BTC per day, by exchanging garbage coins for BTC.
Are you a US user? bitfinex still offers BTC lending, but its closed off to US customers.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:31:04
yup, hodl, bitcoin is dead, get back to work on bitcoin.

Bitcoin has to fight every day, won't ever stop.
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:45:35
He says many things, including centralization of mining must be destroyed. That isn't gonna work with bcash, since one company mines it.
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:56:08
the state of new york is pretty anti bitcoin/crypto right now, businesses will end up moving to other areas, NY is a bad place to mine anyways
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:22:05
We dont know what they have, literally. Its just a guy on a shitty talk show that doesn't know anything about how cryptos work except... everything is a scam but his thing.

Roger just cares about making money, and he is always willing to play the villain/troll. He is a huge piece of shit, but the attention he gets for it just helps him.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:02:37
We don't, we just stand off to the side and watch what happens. If you own some Bitcoin, its not fun, but not much we can do. If you don't own Bitcoin, maybe your just here to be a jerk.
@_date: 2018-11-11 01:50:56
No one knows, who cares, buy bitcoin and hodl.

going forward not sure how anyone can't afford to not hold a hedge against fiat inflation.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:59:42
if people are buying in risky ways, its better to clean it out now, short term its bad news, long term doesn't matter
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:38:59
I listen to Bloomberg a lot, it's not a great source of info if you aren't buying stocks. Half the hosts make fun of Bitcoin(and all cryptos). 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:48:10
This is how it all plays out, and it just highlights the need for decentralization.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:01:21
The arguements during this bear period are nothing like that last, its just about price. Last time we were fighting on direction.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:28:39
Cool stuff

no one here is saying that...

by the time the news hits its to late, you can't predict movement of price

bitcoin clashic is the real true vision of satoshi
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:43:50

lets see if bcash wants to drop asic mining also
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:19:27
what about his proof of work change, to eliminate asic miners? is bcash going with that change also?

The market will always find the price, no issue with the person selling. It's their right, and Bitcoin will redistribute and move on.

We have to wait a bit yet, there are leverage options in a few spots if you to place trades against your holdings. Some of the US exchanges are dropping them though.

Lets not automatically assume all of china is the same as Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:20:37
Problem is are they making interest off holding everything before xfering it, what are they up to in between you getting your BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:34:57
I think they are running on very thin margins, and maybe going into the red after the next halving. I dont think they care what crypto wins, they want to be a payment processor.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:39:42
Lotta threats of regulation, most of the sellers are probably people that bought in the last 1/4 of fomo, so they are less likely to hodl.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:54:27
Buy what amount you want in USD or whatever fiat you have. If your in the US, gemini is a good place to start. Coinbase is an option, but the fee's are a bit higher.

Which one? It's still good for bitcoin, but probably not the average person in china, because IMO the government now wants a cut.

Bitcoin and the blockchain has so many uses not even thought of yet. It's exciting but also scary.

they want to phase out tether...
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:00:27
Prevents idiots from doing something dumb, also means people buying going forward are less stupid. This is a good thing, and yes also shows transaction censorship.

The exchanges are getting alot more regulation. They want them to institute a token system like tether.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:55:18
no... regulation has to happen on some levels for us to see the real moon.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:36:32
whats it cost to get on that show?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:09:38
probably, but might be bumpy for a bit longer
@_date: 2017-09-09 16:49:53
Because he is invested in trying to collect txn fees, and doesn't really care about value, censorship resistance, decentralization, and everything else that benefits normal users.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:03:36
Yes, but blaming LN for government regulation in favor of big banks is just stupid. Any government can decide to do that with or without second layer or whatever.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:43:55
Totally normal price movements, just get used to it and dont worry about it.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:15:44

He is selling a "legal" ICO I guess, stupid fundraising will still be stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:46:26
He is saying its more valuable because he believes it backed by something "tangible", but a bad investment is still a bad investment. Also what is the blockchain? Is it even a blockchain?

of course, a long as you set intervals and just do it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:38:40
more people getting scammed was always going to end in regulation.... No one wants to responsible for their own bad decisions.

@_date: 2017-09-04 14:47:49
An ICO was always just equity in a company with an expectation of profit, the US is probably next. If it drains some idiots from bitcoin, it was bound to happen at some point.

It's volatile, but in the end it always goes higher.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:12:59
I think thats fair assessment, its way over the value of the assets it holds.
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:10:49
much easier to send, uncensored, gold is for older generations, ask him if he likes cash now, and imagine being in a cashless society without bitcoin

bought more, wish had cash to buy more
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:42:55
thanks for the dip, just got some more:)
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:08:13
What is expensive? I can send 6k for .60 cents, that cost me less the bank fees.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:24:50
I think you need to spend alot of time looking at how governments create fiat money, and then you'll start to get an idea of why Bitcoin isn't a scam.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:19:15
He says they don't feel an obligation to mine either chain. Which means that no one on that stage feels bound anymore to NYA, that doesn't mean they won't still follow it. They are keeping options open, just like the people currently mining their own coin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:30:34
What do you expect in pullbacks, with new people here.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:39:30
It can greatly affect citizens in that countries ability to access it, but it can't change bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-11 02:44:28
nope, there are alot of miners in china and plenty of them aren't aligned with bitmain, as well as bitcoin users.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:33:20
People think im advocating for the overthrow of governments. When Im just advocating for something that removes conflicts of interest. It's not hard to see when debt keeps going up, and the AVERAGE citizen makes less money.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:57:13
who said anything about any of that....
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:07:18
they are uncorrelated.....

in before ledgerX and institutions is early
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:28:09
I've done both, really just depends on FCF.
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:26:01
what happens in china wont affect you, unless bitmain is able to monopolize block size adjustments

Good lord people, don't bite....

cool, can't wait to see how it turns out

Why would this make the ruble more valuable? It's still the same currency with all the same drawbacks.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:09:58
nope, its done in Bitcoin first, eth just copies it like every other alt
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:08:00
Probably, he isn't parting with most of his bitcoin holdings.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:35:14
He doesn't counter any of Max Keiser's points on anything... He just says its not money because I say so. He isn't even participating in the debate in meaningful way.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:10:30
Come on this is post  who knows what it is...
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:54:57
Do a lot of reading on cloud mining before investing. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:39:57
I absolutely agree, part of bitcoin is to trust no one. We all just need to be aware of where interest lie, and make economic decisions in our own self interest just like Bitmain(which happen to directly oppose each other). I'd have more respect for Bitmain if they were honest about trying to be the big Co in the space, instead of spreading false information. I don't think it's a big deal to support your own investment, its a whole different thing to do what they do instead.
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:45:54
You have to make moves ahead of time always, traders buy or sell stocks based on 6 months from now. It's harder to look that far ahead with bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:04:26
That is actually in addition, those 2 things aren't mutually exclusive. You can decide on a case by case basis if it's a scam or not, probably 99% of them won't make it.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:23:17
He is trying to protect his own business interests, but coming out this aggressive just looks shady.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:48:51

Really who knows, alot of people are super emotional, the time to buy is when everyone is scared, but its hard to do.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:28:16
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:43:01
Focus on 6 months out or some further timeframe, don't watch the price constantly. It took me a long time to figure that last part out.
@_date: 2017-09-18 16:00:52
Just a mispell on a post, then it just got stuck in everyones head
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:33:00
I don't know honestly. He is talking about wage inflation, but the wage inflation in the US in the last few years is primarily within the 1%. I think if he wants to promote himself as a villain he does a great job.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:51:22
CSW isn't the type to "think" about what he is posting. The more be backs himself into a corner, the crazier it will get.
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:18:40
If you read the subs and see the same thing, not sure Bitcoin is for you.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:18:48
Dunno, but would like to know how this works out.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:16:34
how does that compare with other investments? like stock trading?
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:03:08
So did I, relax, it happens, it goes up and down alot. I generally buy on pullbacks, and even yesterday was a small one.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:10:09
It won't affect your BTC, there will be a second coin that you will be given reflecting your BTC holdings. You will have your BTC, and you will have B2X. There will be price swings up and down, probably a drop in value post fork because people will buy in up to the fork.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:27:24
He is talking to the over 60 crowd...
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:40:52
If it is, then that is securities fraud, and this is why we will get regulated. So remember to thank them for causing it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:35:08
Can you cite me on that?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:42:24
There will be an update after the fork, just have to wait for it. That is the way its handled in the past. They add support after for the new coins.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:23:52
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:57:57
Yes, but its difficult to prove intent, just like with statements from certain people about how broken bitcoin is. It still happens all the time every single day. It's unethical, and should be illegal, but it doesn't stop those inclined to try it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:13:23
Bond debt, who wants to buy it now? China doesn't want to purchase US debt anymore...
Don't put all your money in anything.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:07:04
Great point.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:11:36
you will need to update it at some point, most wallets will support the update, just double check and make sure
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:54:58
just bought some, this is the way it goes, its always a deal until its back up above its high
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:11:14
I could be wrong, but I dont think they had many actual sales. I checked the site from time to time, always had the same stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:26:42
They will move on to the next coin at some point. It was an eth forum for months.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:19:45
He said a private blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:04:04
Thanks for this, cant believe how simple the fake information Wright has produced is.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:13:25
no they will justify it...
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:32:06
yeah I wouldn't think so, but thats how I view it
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:29:38
Partially because they know the stock market is getting overvalued, and they are running out of places to put money.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:01:08
This is a bitcoin forum, we aren't following Iota news report.... The blockchain comes up plenty, but that is attached to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:05:37
Probably to follow up with some weird licensing, market doesn't care what Russia does or doesn't do really. Which is kinda interesting, and says alot about what kind of economic impact Russia actually has.

not only that but you can suggest your own fee's, or pay a premium for faster tx, how is that not the perfect open market system

No one has ever said or suggested no central authority equals no fee, there would be zero incentive for any miner to verify TXs.

@_date: 2017-10-28 18:35:45
Fee's are simultaneously too high AND too low, it doesn't really matter. Remember Segwit TX are unfairly cheap.
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:02:36
You can't have an honest dicussion if your gonna start with "Segwit gets rid of signatures". Your gonna defend bitcoin from a position it doesn't take.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:23:13
We don't know, but we invest/hold it anyways.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:09:40

“We’re going to see more deals like that in the coming year. And we will be doing USD trading; this won’t be open to everybody, available for the majority of our customers as well as foreign partners that build on top of us.”

Blocksize increases are part of the Core roadmap.... Done safely. It's stupid to rush things for literally no reason.
No one is against larger blocks, anyone that says Core is against larger blocks is a liar.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:02:55
Why not take part in the developer dicussions, that includes 100s of people, if not more if you have the technical ability. Why would anyone want the greatest fintech invention ever to prioritize bandwidth over safety and security. I don't speak for developers because I'm not one, but you can msg them on here, or email them.
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:41:42
Nope, you can't run a decentralized blockchain without an independant reward. It doesn't work when someone pulls the strings. It doesn't work if a bank creates a private blockchain, and then says validate this because trust us. That is what the big banks want, a privately run blockchain.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:14:49
they aren't impartial, but who knows, we have crazier predictions out there
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:10:44
Yes, and the stock market is getting pretty overvalued, meaning its starting to get hard to find places to put money with short-term upside(not long-term).
I hold both as part of a diversified portfolio, which is always the smartest thing to do.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:50:03

I just hope he keeps talking.
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:40:07
Who knows.... They have 2 devs, they tried to run a testnet today and took it down. They estimated a week, but if alot of problems pop up it could be longer(probably a good bet).
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:07:08
Only way is if he offered the fee.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:38:36
No one said anything about cashing out...
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:15:37
Bitcoin gets some inflow, how much is hard to say. Most of the stock market is still skeptical, and probably will be for a bit. Bitcoin needs to get a bit bigger, more regulation, and a bit less volatile. Alot of people have heard about Bitcoin now, but they need to see it a bunch and learn about it before investing.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:53:41
dont move coins around day of, wait for an update to the wallet that adds support for both

@_date: 2017-10-17 15:02:31
You've gone from asking why, to stating reasons it needs to be done now. It's raises alot of suspicion that you weren't actually asking why "honestly" in the first place. I didn't even state a reason against, and your pushing that it needs to be done now. Without care for the safety and security of the network. Bitcoin has taken nine years to get to this point, a few extra months of careful testing isn't deviating from anything.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:22:33
They aren't, they are part of Core roadmap done safely with proper testing before.
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:55:10
Let this blow over, its not true until something actually happens. Traders don't want calm waters, the exchanges don't actually want things calm either. We probably have alot of new users here, and shit goes down with Bitcoin several times per month....
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:37:00
the nowhere in that chart phase
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:02:56
We won't see a true peak til 2X fork, its possible there is no big drop if ledgerX activity picks up alot.

cobra bitcoin is pushing for it every day, it doesn't jive with the bcash crowd at all since they are the miners.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:14:41
I think thats reasonable, Im a hodler but I'd never tell anyone to put everything all into one investment(including bitcoin). I think if you have a well diversified portfolio, bitcoin should be a part of it. It should never ever be all of it. I just had too much of my stock portolio in US healthcare, so I decided to move a bit out. If bitcoin grows to much, it's also smart to re-balance some.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:32:25
awesome, now we get some big investors starting to come in.

@_date: 2017-10-02 21:25:45
You don't "clash" with anyone. Bitcoin is great because it's whatever that user wants it to be for them. If your a hodler or a spender, it works either way.

Can you find a citation?
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:39:40
There is alot of fear of something becoming a better investment, so that is a big part of it. Most normal people have to hear about Bitcoin 5-10 times before they start to listen. If it's about equity investing being threatened, they have it all wrong. Bond investing is really threatened by Bitcoin.

Pretty bad basic articles doesn't understand the tech, could be on any website. There is alot of bad info on bitcoin, takes time and most people don't understand it yet.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:57:13
They are acting in their own self interest, which is reasonable. The problem is that is not what they promote publicly.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:23:21
Your going to get free coins when the fork happens, it creates a seperate block chain with another coin. It's sort of like a dividend for holding bitcoin, but we aren't supporting the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:09:23
Great, sell yours and go away.

have him watch Andreas Aantonopoulos on youtube
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:01:03
Why would anyone attempt that, there is no upside. That is like asking miners if they have ever considered setting all their equipment on fire.

everyone happy with the continued devaluation of their production?
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:53:38
No one said that, and your talking about a network we pay for. Which also doesn't replace the need for Bitcoin, because it comes with a massive amount of trust.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:58:24
Think about what you have now if you didn't buy into bitcoin, leave the past in the past.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:10:21
If you don't see any benefit from an immutable ledger that removes alot of centralized conflicts, then there is no reason to be in it.
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:52:34
Nah, this is old news
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:56:54
Everytime they've gotten into specifics, they've mentioned being in favor of it at the right time. Since there is no reason for larger blocks right now, it doesn't make any sense in the near future anyways.

fuck coinbase, way to confuse the crap out of consumers who are reading this stuff and are like wtf is does this mean
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:57:23
Sure, but that is more like a private bank ledger pretending to be a blockchain. The market doesn't set the price, or the supply, it's not even close to trustless.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:14:41
Im a retailer of consumer goods, lotta price increases for next year. Bitcoin is, if nothing else(emphasis on big if), an inflation hedge.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:22:28
Hodling is more an attitude of not following fake news stories that Bitcoin is broken, or about to crash, reacting and then dumping all your coin. Some mega rich assholes would just buy up all the cheap coin, which basicly happens some on every retrace anyways. It doesn't have anything to do with buying/selling things for bitcoin. No one here advocates not using bitcoin for transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:38:22
I agree with you on the behavior, but Schiff's answers are like Trump saying "im my own evidence". That's not really debating with any kind of substance.

So manipulate the market to offset cheaper production somewhere else, leading to higher prices everyone has to pay for something domestically. Leading to more inflation, and devaluing the money sitting in your bank account vs the cost of purchasing that item.

Your not going to find a perfect entry point(you'll just keep waiting), so I think doing little amounts over time to get comfortable is the way to go. I misunderstood your earlier post.

"The concerns underlying the disapproval order go to the merits of bitcoin—and thus the bitcoin-based ETP at issue here—as an investment. The order raises concerns about potential future actions of potential large holders of bitcoin,[9] academic speculation about past manipulation in the market,[10] and the lack of regulation of the spot market.[11] Indeed, if the disapproval order’s rigorous standard were applied consistently, many commodity-based ETPs would be in peril, as rumors of manipulation plague many commodity markets,[12] and surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets cannot eliminate the sometimes messy nature of the commodities markets. Moreover, because it opines at length about the quality of the bitcoin spot market, the disapproval order suggests that, when we do finally approve an ETP on bitcoin (or any other product traded in a non-traditional market), investors may reasonably—but incorrectly—conclude that the investment carries with it the SEC’s imprimatur because the Commission has performed due diligence on the underlying market and, through its approval, is certifying the quality of that market."
The SEC does not check on individual markets all over the world, because its impossible. So holding Bitcoin to a standard they can't enforce is a little silly, and don't require for anything else.

@_date: 2017-09-01 00:10:41
grats man
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:53:18
Fees are calculated on chain in satoshi's per kb, as the price of bitcoin goes up, fees always have to go up. So anyone that is saying fees shouldn't go up, is literally insane. Are you looking to create arguements with people? The governments of the world can also regulate nodes whether first layer, or 51st layer, if they decided too. That is another stupid arguement blaming LN for something that could happen whether or not second layer transactions exist. Zimbabwee could decide that everyone who operates a bitcoin node has to wear yellow clownsuits, or that they can only be run by the bilderberg group and Nike.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:27:02

You can use a wallet to suggest your own fees, if your patient and don't care about it confirming quickly. You can also overpay on fees to get a quicker confirm. It's an incentive system, and that's how it supposed to work. Fee's will also always follow the value of bitcoin vs fiat. Do you think Bitcoin fee's shouldn't be incentivized? People can pay more or less for quicker confirms? Or be allowed to use wallets that do different things with fees?

@_date: 2018-04-27 21:18:25
great article, thanks for the link
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:08:08
just report
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:17:08
bitcoin is pretty unpredictable, making history each day
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:02:17
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:04:56
Im not sure what that means, really. Does inflation exist? Does he know that 1 bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin? Does he know about forex trading?
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:21:35
next few minutes lol
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:34:46
yeah you know because its driven by technical analysis based around stocks..... /s
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:11:39
"Which then brings me to the ultimate reason why the mainstream hates bitcoin: nobody can benefit residually from its existence!" 
this is a bigger part of it then most people realize.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:38:58
anyone able to help websites set this up?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:19:07
they all seem to work as long as you exit at the right time.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:19:28
thats all im asking for, can someone clarify what is agreed to?
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:52:08
try telling that to bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:32:05
Thats good, but I wish the wording is more clear. The part about running parrellel seems to suggest that SW may not be required for the 2MB hardfork.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:37:48
why does this agreement propose to change the version bit used to signal segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:36:52
"i think" it's just my opinion, but bond investing really sucks right now.... Why would you buy bonds in a currency losing value to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:01:40
I have to turn up his videos alot, always annoying.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:34:14
Segwit is a network upgrade that creates larger block sizes. The person suggesting the SW+2MB block upgrade is also calling for a 12 month study, before upgrading to 2MB blocks.
Bitmain didn't have to add covert asicboost to chips, thus requiring us to place trust in them not to use it. The whole point of Bitcoin is not having to trust others, because we all have rights to the network. It's the right of everyone who uses Bitcoin to decide what goes forward. They invested alot in hash power, its not our responsibility to keep them profitable.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:49:20
As long as she has the stomach for the ups and downs. Not nearly enough fiat in it yet to be stable.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:42:33
Time in Bitcoin beats trying to time Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:01:46
lol, come on man...
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:03:23
If the price of bitcoin crashes, so will all other cryptos.
I wouldn't worry to much about the Mid may one, that isn't the one investors really care about now. There are others upcoming that represent more usd.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:54:37
It's not 110% interest.... It's for people that don't understand sliding difficulty until they find out down the road they got screwed.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:03:57
There is no compromise, they run parrallel. Neither is dependant on the other to happen. They are using very tricky wording.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:12:53
who knows, its bitcoin, longterm its great, short term is hard to predict
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:40:18
nice subtle sarcasm
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:21:43
are you crazy? do you really want this in your life?
good luck
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:11:08
who? seriously do they count anymore?
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:33:43
I'm waiting, just trying to figure out where the stabilization point is. I've bought at all price levels, including some at $2700. I never sell, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:39:16
Wouldn't they need to apply for a patent at that point then?
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:21:06
offset by tarifs, trump is just a gangster for the wealthy
@_date: 2018-07-09 13:49:38
no one knows what it will do, buy some bitcoin, dont worry about the price, unless your a stupid trader
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:07:43
dont trade, hodl, and don't listen to people telling you to trade
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:35:20
they both are, im in the US, its in big trouble from bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:48:53
Pretty much...
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:51:07
its actually far more...
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:57:03
It represents a small fraction of the currency, that some people like.
@_date: 2017-05-19 17:05:54
Fucking Exactly!
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:11:27
Nothing they say is going to satisfy people that either hate them, or are competitors(but not being honest about it).
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:13:46
Isnt it more about building a moat around transactions fees, if bitcoin has massive adoption. It would be like being a central part of Visa or something equivalent. Power and being extremely rich.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:47:39
If JP morgan or some giant Co. could put up a tollbooth they would, and then promote bitcoin to the heavens. They can't, so they take a hostile stance, which bitcoin expects. It doesn't care, and it works either way.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:56:55
You need to wait for Airbitz to release a statement on the fork. Your money should be safe either way, just need to see if they will support it and give you access to both your coins. Send a msg to their customer service, asking them how they instead to handle the fork.
It's a good idea to buy a hardware wallet anyways for cold storage. You will always have to wait for all wallets to implement updates post fork, to access the split.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:54:24
Watching with great interest!
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:28:54
If you trust Vitalik then your cool with Eth, if you don't trust him then it's pretty easy to avoid it.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:39:32
The higher the price goes, the less of an effect it has. Why do you need to sell out? You might not need to. If bitcoin has a large value increase you'll be able to spend it all over.
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:15:44
yup, id just buy actual bitcoin its pretty easy to sign up for gemini and buy some yourself.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:49:38
driven? TA is just another part of watching securities, bitcoin is something very new without a hundred years of patterns. The years of wall street patterns always show one thing, time in beats timing.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:02:25
Its been a billion dollar industry. Wait til it's a trillion, its gonna get worse. If you think fighting over money is bad now, just wait a couple years. It's much better to have things out in the open, instead of having things hidden.
@_date: 2017-05-15 01:34:52
Inflation and loss of confidence in some fiats is a big reason, more confidence and placing a higher value on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:36:53
nothing to do with tax day, if it did everything would be affected, its going up because it got cheap
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:47:17
It doesn't matter, by for 5 years from now or whatever timeframe down the road.
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:10:05
It seems expensive because everything is quoted in one Bitcoin, average people don't understand you can buy fractions of them.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:12:04
No bitcoin is more like the chuck norris of crypto currency, gravity is subject to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:15:16
Good points, and there are plenty of crypto scams going on right now. In fact the scams probably far out number the legitimate endeavors. It's another reason to stick to bitcoin, and be very wary of anything else, IE trading bitcoin for tokens, converting to the next "better" currency. Participating in ICO is crazy, it's unregulated security selling, and you are liable the moment you buy something if your government decides to go after it. There is alot of stuff going on without regards to rules, some of which are bullshit and some which actually make sense.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:14:48
There might be a better exchange for you to use in the UK, maybe someone else there can chime in?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:11:15
You can buy goods and services with bitcoin. Most things are fractions of bitcoins, you will always be able to buy bitcoin.
You can apply anything you just said to any fiat currency, except its crimes against humanity are far worse. Why does bitcoin care about what happens to USD relative to its value? Bitcoin takes away power from central banks.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:34:50
I can't imagine not holding some, it's more essential then ever. The point of the question was to get people to really think about more then just a comparison to fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:14:09
the more they talk about it, the better
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:55:48
Yup because it will always include more people
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:48:37
It goes up and down all the time, just take a long view of it.
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:38:36
Bitfury is not Russian.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:37:39
i dunno, just theorizing, we can buy local bonds tax free, but not federal.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:50:55
I've been telling those people to buy real bitcoin lol...
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:08:46
I don't hate bitmain, but we shouldn't trust any of these companies to act in any way other then their own self interest. Which is one of the main assumptions for bitcoin users, trust no one. I wish they would disassociate themselves from Ver. I don't like anything he has to say because at some point he is also on record saying the opposite... usually.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:37:19
Who knows for sure, yes IMO the dip from last week is.
We are going to see more price runs up and down til august for sure.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:42:13
my bitcoin foundation is way better...
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:26:47
Exactly, if you read all the technical facts, you start to understand why Bitcoin is better off with careful calculated scaling. Not rushing forward without regard for what could happen.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:53:46
It just hit an all time high, before the payment network was anywhere close to ready. You have to decide whether or not more people will use bitcoin or not down the road.
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:29:33
Only some people are allowed to profit off Bitcoin, no single part of Core is allowed to earn a fair living off development. /s
@_date: 2017-05-06 13:52:29
Im still building to 21....
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:03:34
Yup, bitcoin being bitcoin, thank god it's just doing it's own thing.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:55:41
coinbase doesn't care, they are just gonna support whatever exists
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:19:53
Yes it does provide a wallet service, you can use it that way if you want. I would not suggest it. I think of it as an exchange, but yes they do provide a wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:00:57
You don't, you'll just buy things with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:34:06
They can collect more fees from bigger blocks, it's all about being the center of processing fees for them.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:32:21
thats why people are getting screwed over....
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:49:34
Fucking christ thats horrible but true.
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:49:54
he did suggest that is no reason for a regular user to run a node, and don't come in here namecalling when people are discussing things.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:12:27
Not until some writing any of the rules understands how it works.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:45:41
The more understanding and confidence people have in bitcoin, the less secure they feel about having everything in fiat. It's a massive paradigm shift we are at the beginning of.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:23:42
Everyone expects profit taking to happen at 2000, it's so hard to predict though. I'm unsure, as long as steadily end up with a higher basement.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:48:08
Yeah, and maybe they never need to convert it back into "money"....
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:32:19
I can't second this enough, buy it and try to forget about it. If you aren't a pro trader, you will lose more then you win. You will cash out, then get stuck waiting for a dip that you might not be able to time right. Time in bitcoin beats timing bitcoin. I can tell everyone from experience, I've lost alot of money on bitcoin by being cautious.
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:53:19
That's a very nice thought.
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:22:04
congrats, strap in!
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:30:55
Most of the discussions is about Core=evil, its non-technical and non-productive. Want to argue with me? Snapshot the hot discussions, post a pic, prove me wrong.... I just did fyi. That's not discussing bitcoin objectively, it's attempting to propagate an idea that Core wants to ruin bitcoin. If you disagree with Core's Technical ideas, create a dicussion here so everyone can participate. No one wants to join into a discussion title "why does core want to ruin bitcoin" paraphrasing.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:13:35
Just be patient, it goes up and down alot. Don't watch it daily, it moves alot more then a stock right now, because there isn't much money in bitcoin yet. It's very small compared to whats in most fiat currency, the movement of money in and out creates a ton of fluctuation.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:26:11
1/millionth of the currency.
@_date: 2017-05-16 17:06:33
yup, lot of people going to get burned bad...
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:28:49
I don't want to cash out, I want to use my bitcoin...
I also try to keep a budget and hoard more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:19:27
Yup totally, we dont know what the new basement will be also. I don't like predictions of pie in the sky numbers. I think as the population ages, more people will be using bitcoin, probably less into things like gold. There are alot of things in favor of it as a longterm investment, asset, whatever you want to call it, p2p cash. I'm totally bullish on bitcoin longterm, but I expect a bubble this year because the price is just going up to quickly.
@_date: 2017-05-18 20:07:20
It's not split evenly, SW is holding for 95% also. Some people don't like that and want UASF, which again some people don't support.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:04:55
Sure, as long as he is not the person doing the guiding, amirite?
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:56:54
yeah, its an old article, we keep finding more gold.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:02:12
I've been at it awhile:)
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:15:41
voting with your money, thats all we can do
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:16:59
There is more of a conflict when the largest miners advocate for bigger blocks. It's bitcoin, don't trust anyone.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:23:36
No problem, bitcoin is very volatile. If you watch longterm tracking its up, but in between its a rollercoaster. Tone Vays has some great youtube videos on it. Also, I've purchased some at almost every $100 price increase.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:06:15
Nah, the 21 club is just people that own 21 bitcoins total, not the amount in USD.
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:32:09
If 7.5% of the coins were privately held maybe, what % is privately held?
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:48:08
they just prove why bitcoin is needed
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:37:26
As long as he doesn't take it a step further then that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:35:17
Segwit is great, because lightning can scale almost to infinite. That being said, I support a compromise like Segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:50:16
Some yes, some are riding up, as some larger crypto traders are diversified more. I won't do it, because if bitcoin crashes, they all crash.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:45:16
good question, not sure, hopefully we get a detailed answer
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:26:29
Please make sure you read a ton, there is alot of great resources on this forum. Ledger, Trezor, and Keep key are some good wallets that will work for iOS(I think most do though?).
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:37:34
dude i mined some coins a long time ago, and got rid of them.... FML
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:38:51
im not against, just trying to make sure it's not using wording meant for people to assume stuff is required that isn't.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:35:38
yes but that doesn't explicitly say they depend on each other, its implied. I'm just confused lol, I'm not against anything.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:34:56
Peak visa capacity is 56k tsp, lightning can scale to billions. It would crush legacy payment systems. Some miners are worried about the fees from lightning. I'm not on a side, just trying to learn as much as I can.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:02:00
That guy is a fucking idiot, but more attention is always good.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:48:00
Ugh, this guy....
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:11:30
Fine, but does the agreement actually agree to activate Segwit prior to the 2MB hardfork? Or does Segwit literally have nothing to do with a 2MB hardfork happening?
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:08:49
The Euro works out great for them, not so for all the poorer countries.
No one issues bitcoin Bro...
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:03:35
He's good at turning the technical stuff into something regular people can understand. Always support his stuff!
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:46:07
This is just one of many points of view....
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:32:32
No one knows, but we just touched alot of all time highs, might take months to get back or a week.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:14:46
Nope, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins in existence, so im building up to 1/millionth. You can buy fractions for any amount also, you don't need to buy whole numbers.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:28:35
You will go through this many times, I try to ignore charts and reddit some days. i've seen so many ups and downs, and I get stuck watching it.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:54:45
ill buy you a beer if your ever in DC
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:33:38

What if he has the racoon suit on?
@_date: 2017-05-09 20:52:45
It's a bit of security against your government acting stupidly. Which is inevitable.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:34:24
Can you paste it here? I can't find it on the medium article. I really believe you, just can't find the explicit wording.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:36:49
The higher the price goes, the more fiat has been converted/added. We will eventually see smaller prices movements. People think yesterday was a flash crash, we've seen much bigger movements per day in the past.
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:01:28
gotta be a more creative way to destroy some, like make it a spectacle
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:28:24
can you offer proof?
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:08:10
No they didn't, blocksize increase is part of the roadmap.
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:33:13
Welcome to the next pump and dump bitcoin-cash, they are dumping Eth and moving on to the next scam.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:51:11
Great talk, he feels its all just part of the evolution of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:25:31
It's fair to say that both have been horrible for economies all over the world. I think Amazon obviously has done more damage though. All our local governments make deals with both of them, tax breaks, cheap warehouse land. Another reason to support Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:28:10
Most don't yet, but still more do then a few days or weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:22:59
They already bought in, once Goldman announces this stuff, institutional people are buying already. We've been building a support level for the last week between 2300-2400.

np, ask away.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:10:50
Its indicating a strong chance of a pop midweek.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:38:28
Yup, much prefer gemini, better fees.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:41:52
Wow, so it will go up and down?
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:12:44
your gtg, there is always a delay, welcome to the club.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:32:42
cost average your fine
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:36:57
I think it's quite a bit more then 100+.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:22:55
1 was empty which is alot quicker to mine for the reward.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:54:46
I want a market cap of 250 billion, then we will see alot more people paying attention.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:17:01
There is obvious Bias against Bitcoin, because it threatens alot of very large established businesses, even whole industries.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:05:07
lol, i mean that is horrible.
@_date: 2017-07-10 12:50:19
I don't think anyone would dare debate him, I'd love to see it though.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:12:10
A million BTC is crazy any time in the near future, if it happens anytime soon then we are seeing massive inflation.
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:51:36
Be bullish longterm, just be careful short term. Don't get emotional and panic sell or buy. Speculators drive alot of these movements, there is alot of money on the side right now watching.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:37:23
Lol, don't try to be your own bank...
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:22:04
Past results....
Gimme a break with this stuff.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:05:10
gheez.... this is post number 9000 on this same topic in the last few years. It's gonna go up its gonna go down, watch it longterm and relax.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:41:11
Maybe, quite a few are pre-mined, meaning most of the currency is held out of the marketplace but still factors into total market cap.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:42:52
yup pretty much, not very safe or smart.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:19:04
I dont really pay much attention to my cost average, just going to continue to accumulate til I get to 21.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:52:10
Are we talking all of his coins or some?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:52:34
sure, let me respond to that with the same amount of research they did, and say no...
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:06:32
Good for him...
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:25:42

be careful playing with that place!
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:07:57
Agreed, if your not trading(me) who cares. However it still invites alot more attention, because you and I both assume they are talking BS. Which is what gets stuff regulated.
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:58:38
More users then ever, with more trying each day, no reason not to be bullish.

There is no compromise, they run parrallel. Neither is dependant on the other to happen. They are using very tricky wording.

GS has way to much of an effect on the price of equities, I'd rather not see them push bitcoin up or down.
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:30:38
he's a notorious troll...
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:27:21
They know how to find quick empty blocks for a fast block reward. They do it alot.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:44:28
I just keep explaining to people how it works, 99% of the worlds population has no idea. Alot more know the name Bitcoin now, but nothing beyond that.
@_date: 2017-05-04 15:44:22
Alot of people are calling that, we will see. Timing stuff like this is always impossible.
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:22:51
It's alot of talk about scaling protocols, and Segwit is good for Bitcoin scaling. I wouldn't get too caught up in any opinions.
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:59:26
I don't think anyone foresaw one miner becoming so big. It's something to guard against going forward.

yeah and another coin is already using the symbol, BCC is a joke

Im not sure its part of a broader report on markets for this week. I've read more details on market insider, but I don't know where to access the actual report itself. Hopefully someone else can link it.

i don't care about all that, what are you running today
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:21:24
 miners love LN. LN makes bitcoin price higher, and miners love bitcoin sold at high price, hence miners love LN.
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:05:45
yeah yeah yeah, roger wants roger rules coin, and he talks out of both sides of his mouth on everything
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:43:19
yeah man bitcoin is dead, sell everything for dash, its over, just run your masternode and forget BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:53:20
This is all for currency traders, just ignore the BS. They are pumping and then dumping.

the fees via gemini are always pretty good, are you able to use that exchange from the UK?

thats great, good luck

don't take the bait...
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:16:58
which one?
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:14:58
BCC has zero use outside of the exchanges that support it, no one will touch it for anything else. It's stealing the symbol of another scamcoin that already exists.
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:18:12
fundamental analysis is great, tech analysis who knows.

Most likely at some point todays value will seem like the equivalent of buying it at $100 a few years ago. However, I won't try to put a date on that, because it's impossible to predict.

Not when others are applying for patents on the same stuff, there is way too much at stake.
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:38:50
I bought at all price levels since 500-2700, if you need the money tomorrow it's not a good risk. If you able to wait this out, then don't worry about price. Except to the extent that you could hold more for less.
@_date: 2017-07-02 18:48:18
I agree, but the tone of the other poster went downhill pretty fast.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:50:35
I to would be willing to post a positive comment, if you can message me privately and offer incentives:)
@_date: 2017-07-21 17:48:07
wonder if they are using a third party or if internal.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:53:02
We need both really...
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:03:59
They are adding a trust element(bank) into the equation, big surprise. It's unfortunate that alot of these people won't learn how to use it directly.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:43:38
its cool
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:43:28
well, im not talking about you, if you didn't start panic selling...
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:20:33
Ethereum and other alts are draining, people moving money out getting ready to invest in Bitcoin(post scaling upgrade). We've got alot of propaganda being spread to affect price, so large buyers can get in at cheaper prices. This is all IMO of course.

production of society
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:01:09
You have to stop thinking about Bitcoin in stock terms for valuation, its not a stock. It's value depends on us users deciding what one is worth. It's still very new and young, we don't have decades of information to follow. The "big fishes" can still cause the currency to fluctuate more, but first they would need to buy some to then sell. It will need a lot more fiat currency invested before we see smaller fluctuations. It's really volatile, if you want something stable, bitcoin is not what you want.
Also, asking questions is great.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:01:27
ugh, wait and hope for Segwit...
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:10:50
No you move your bitcoin off the exchange to your own hardware wallet. You purchase it via an exchange, and then move it off. Never leave your bitcoin on an exchange longterm.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:32:24
Carefully buy in, try Gemini for an account.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:49:02
Thanks for the insight.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:40:50
there weren't any i searched with it
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:38:27
but isn't validation quicker?
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:07:04
are you running a non-core client?
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:43:50
Don't buy in again until you feel like you've got it under control.
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:30:58
No, we have a guy saying he is Satoshi with zero proof. It's exactly what needs to be done. They have patents that are out in the open for anyone to use for free. They can't go back on that, they would actually be liable.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:08:17
Most of us here aren't traders and don't care.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:22:48
I wouldn't take it as an attack, but you mention a trend toward centralization. Which is a pretty huge reason not to allow dynamic soft blocks, especially in todays mining environment.
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:07:50
HODL is the way to GODL
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:27:34
If your not a savy trader, buy at set intervals. Do small amounts to accumulate slowly, price goes up you buy some, price goes down you buy some.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:38:35
bitcoin hodlers dont care...

I've been forced to use paypal for years, can't wait for it to die. Such bad service, so many issues you can't get resolved.

That article points out alot more problems with this forums and it's user then elsewhere.... You might want to be a little more objective approaching a group of people and saying essentially you guys are mostly the problem.
@_date: 2017-07-05 00:48:55
He's trolled here before, and has pulled stunts like this before. He is just a good troll.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:28:35
at least you have potcoin right
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:25:17
No one said it's "the solution", its only one of many, and bitcoin requires consensus to change which doesn't exist atm.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:51:12
I know that, but emotions get the best of everyone sometimes.
@_date: 2017-05-23 13:40:07
He didn't just say it's working fine, he went on to explain why the network is good with the limit and forces real solutions now rather then later.
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:05:54
It doesn't, bitcoin will continue to be the central crypto.
Ethereum is a weird coin, and you can get alot of triggered responses if you talk about it the wrong way. You do have to place trust in a central foundation with it. For some people it's not a big deal, for others it's a huge issue. It's nice to have some choices.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:41:01
They look at like it's a stock, it's not a stock.... It's worth whatever people value it to be worth.
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:15:30
Segwit has been debated here hundreds of times....
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:15:05
short feeling the squeeze?
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:58:30
which ones are yours?
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:36:31
I want it to go up, just don't want them to exert any price influence. It can always swing the other way.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:28:39
They aren't going to support it with anywhere close to that amount of hash power. It's all talk.
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:21:16
I didn't suggest a ratio, ok kid
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:42:41
yup exactly, should be all
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:09:13
The only thing less accurate then CNN is probably anything Trump says.
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:28:32
Be careful with this, I love bitcoin, and I have quite a bit. Please watch Tone Vays, and other people that do technical analysis. Alot of TA is BS, but just stay informed. If your buying to hold for years, then it doesn't matter. If you need to pay your bills, and not get in over your head, then watch it carefully.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:16:18
If they are sending from their own wallet should be fast, if they have money on exchange it might be slow.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:13:04
I bought some, just a little though.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:35:09
Your first paragraph says the issues is with both camps, and then every example is a problem with posts from r/bitcoin.
Why would someone debate anyone cherrypicking random posts from any internet forum for being inaccurate, then lumping the entire membership of the forum into a one size fits all box. Just because some of us disagree. If you search both forums your going to find plenty of bullshit, BECAUSE ITS THE INTERNET.

It has alot of euphemisms for us, and we probably forget not everyone knows what we mean. If your asking seriously. It's not something I use alot.
@_date: 2017-07-03 21:22:48
If I were those people, I would just give up and find another coin. Bitcoin isn't for them, they can't buy chiclets with it because THE FEES. That means bad breath, bitcoin causes bad breath.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:10:02
Yes they are, and its good to be vocal. However, don't overestimate the value of what they can accomplish, most exchanges and bitcoin holders don't place any value on BCH.
@_date: 2017-07-09 17:07:15
well yeah... its nowhere close just because of inflation which is going to happen everywhere, the Euro is on shaky ground.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:05:42
I hope you do:)

@_date: 2017-07-09 16:34:11
Lol yeah...
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:00:06
miners love LN. LN makes bitcoin price higher, and miners love bitcoin sold at high price, hence miners love LN.

@_date: 2017-05-13 13:35:47
Too many people looking to buy in when the price drops now, it's not stable yet because there is not enough money in it. That's probably years down the road. We have more people using it, but that also causes more volatility.
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:23:54
I can't imagine or hope, that anyone takes anything they read on Forbes and then goes to invest because of it.
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:07:53
Sure lets start a race, with 1 participant having a giant headstart... "solution must not dramatically accelerate the trend toward centralization." You said it, why would you propose anything that didn't explicitly prevent this.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:56:03
I didn't insist, but deciding to mine invalid blocks(or an attack) can be done now, or anytime.
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:44:00
It was pretty much right away right?
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:44:13
dont give him more press, he's a joke....
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:13:53
They aren't against a hard fork, only against one done too quickly.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:06:02
Yup, its not a good environment to be quiet. Also the same group of people marveled how much better Ethereum was then BTC just a few weeks ago. It's almost like they don't care about the underlying tech at all, just something new to market.
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:17:18
Fuck every single person that comes in here and says it won't work so lets not bother to try....
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:42:18
Why try to figure it out, and just cost average your buying.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:32:32
Andreas is firmly in the middle.... Anyone that attacks his positions have an extreme bias for one side or the other.
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:27:50
well essentially what this means is they now own some, and so now its ok to be positive.
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:55:04
They can't... Also, If they did that it would make bitcoin more powerful not less.
@_date: 2017-07-11 18:15:53
I'd like to do business with that person, they don't seem to mind overpaying.
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:21:10
News drives price movement, they can create news to help/hurt the price.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:06:44
The distribution of benefits based on who holds the contract has always been the way this is handled, for everything, including stocks. It's only unfair to BCC/BCH in the context that it would be unfair to everything.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:36:39
just bought a little right at 2700:)
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:20:38

I bought at 1586, then when it dropped back under 1500, grabbed a little more.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:59:29
It's not a "scam" because anyone using Bitfinex knew the situation ahead of time. We all have a choice with Bitcoin, some are choosing to use Bitfinex. If you have your Bitcoin on an exchange(repeated again for the trillionth time), its not your coin.. He has an extreme history of only supporting one point of view, and lack of any objectivity. BCC/BCH is a scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-01 23:48:17
I think it's institutional investments after price dips.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:19:39
Remember the risks are being publicized alot so traders can make money off price swings.
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:37:12
Yeah but very few of them work for BS.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:03:22
can you just link them again? i went back 5 or so pages didn't see anything.

thats where they get you, you relax and boom, the fees are back
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:16:34
this is price manipulation IMO
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:25:57
Bitcoin is not a stock. It's very volatile, but if more people use it over time, it's hard for the price to trend down. There will only ever be 21 million shares(2 million of which are probably lost forever), thats the only thing stock like about it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:46:23
the problem is predicting which coins hold value, we've seen many pump and dumps prior to Eth.
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:42:13
Np, its not for everyone. It's very different from most other cryptos in that it's not centrally managed. It's also much further along in development and network testing/capacity vs the others. I'm in because I see it's use continuing to increase. I've also seen lots of price jumps and fallbacks, but it always ends up higher down the road.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:56:25
I think segwit2x is a good start, to study the effects of increased blocks plus segwit. I'm pretty sure that LN isn't the only 2nd layer solution coming also. The more value people see in bitcoin, the more investment we will see.
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:06:17
It's hard to time it, you just really have to be patient.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:31:01
Legacy payment networks don't compare, because your money is in THEIR hands. They have your money, they can move it around because they have it. Bitcoin beats them in every possible way once its TSP increases. Bitcoin already beats bank xfers.

They have never said it should remain 1meg forever, which is what your implying.
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:15:58
I don't think you'll be able to cash out of it right away, but some of the exchanges will probably support it. So if you want, you can send it to an exchange that supports it, and swap it out for a different coin.
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:17:44
He doesn't mean creating more bitcoin people, I'm not exactly sure what he means....

I think the government is very confused about whether or not Bitcoin is money?

You will have coins on a different chains, its kind of like dividing them in 2, but one of the chains (abc) will be next to worthless. Your still going to send your normal BTC on the regular blockchain. The new coin will be on a different chain, and you will have the same amout of coins on that chain that you now have in BTC.

@_date: 2017-07-04 23:07:37
1. yes
2. doesn't work that way, no person in the middle, once you see the transaction it just needs confirmations
3. a smart contract could have an agreement that requires shipping information to be added and confirmed before money is released.

Way too much price manipulation before locking in. Remember the companies going back and forth with signalling, its not accidental.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:47:45
No its not, its a pump and dump scam coin by a group of shady business people that keep pushing the next best thing. When it fails, they will just repeat it again with the next scam coin. Ver has named a dozen coins better then BTC, and then when they don't work out, he just moves to the next. The ethereum community should be madder then we are, since they've dumped that coin overnight for something else.
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:03:21
Why would a miner mine an invalid block? Unless you are suggesting they are trying to trick everyone with Segwit signaling, and then steal everyones coin? In Which case btc would have absolutely no value to anyone ever. Rendering their own investment instantly useless.

If they have no control over it, then seems fine to me. Yes these are difficult problems with so many factors to consider. We shouldn't want to just push out an update to satisfy someones needs right now. If it leads to problems down the road, or doesn't really provide a lasting solution. I cautiously support Segwit2X, just want to make sure everything is carefully vetted. I also know that NYA details seem to depend on which signatory you ask.

There are.... The part of Segwit large miners don't like is off chain scaling, because it lowers the fees they would collect.

Be wary of people like this, could easily see him do an ICO.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:51:45
Yes, but they could offer a premium for the benefits on margin trades.  I guess they felt fees weren't worth the hassle. Margin trading is full of schemes anyways. I think he is bitching about standard stuff basicly. If you create a weird equity split that's never been done before, don't bitch because businesses are just going with standard practice because you feel it's unfair. I mean they can bitch, but I can probably show them billions of margin contracts written with the same kind of terms.

Yep but some of the people that want the HF bump, don't want Segwit, and some of the people that want Segwit don't want the HF bump. We could debate endlessly about what creates more transation capacity Segwit vs 2MB. Some people are against Segwit because of L2 solutions, they just aren't willing to admit that. On chain scaling immediately makes more money for larger miners, which is why they push for that. Off chain scaling will greatly benefit the people developing those solutions. The nice thing about off chain is there are multiple people competing for solutions right now.

There are tons of speculators mucking with price movement between 2500-3000. Once it breaks over 3k, they will move the parameters up. It's just gonna happen for a bit, til we have more hodlers messing with liquidity. We have more loans then ever on Poloniex etc, that also helps with speculation. It's all good problems though, it further cements the utlity of BTC. Also the value, it is the basis of value for all cryptos.

sorry copy and past is bad

Lightning Network uses payment channels with Hashed TimeLock Contracts. Both of those things are currently usable on Bitcoin mainnet without segwit, so LN is possible without segwit.
However, without segwit or another malleability fix, LN channels have to deal with situations where transactions get mutated ("malleated"), which makes them get stuck at various steps. Preventing them from getting stuck permanently requires either introducing trust (which we don't want to do) or setting some annoying timeouts that limit the efficiency of channels.
LN can also take advantage of many of segwits other benefits such as:
Increased security for multisig: every segwit transaction uses multisig, and because it's a new protocol, it can trivially make use of the new segwit output format that allows using this feature.
Script versioning: can be used to add new features to Bitcoin more easily than they can be added without segwit (some features being made more easy to add than others). Two features currently being researched are MAST and signature aggretation---both of which can provide modest increases to the capacity of the network and which can help improve transaction privacy.
More block space: meaning more channels can be opened or closed in any particular block.
Better cost accounting for transactions: related to the above, this provides benefits to people who produce transactions that reduce the short-term and long-term load on full nodes. Lightning-style transactions are effective at doing this, so they benefit from this segwit feature.
Also, fixing malleability for upgraded software makes designing LN-compatible (and any Bitcoin-compatible) wallets much easier in general, so that's a huge plus too.
For Rootstock (RSK), I wrote a very-closely related answer to that question on Bitcoin.StackExchange a couple weeks ago:

That's not true, nor is true that you can tell it's being used. It's covert implimitation so no one knows. It adds a trust element to mining, which should not be a part of bitcoin.

Its hard to predict really, I've owned a bunch for awhile. I always kick myself for not buying more on drop backs. There will be a run before Segwit gets in, with probably alot of sell limits set in case it doesn't.

On chain scaling is a fair compromise to get Segwit. Being inflexible, and sticking to a position without allowing anything to the other side is how we got here. I don't want anything to do with BU, it's just not being developed in the open with proper peer review. Segwit is good, on chain scaling is good, off chain scaling is good.

@_date: 2017-06-09 12:12:52
Off chain transactions are good, on chain scaling is also good. If you have a lot invested in mining, why not just be up front about it. Miners should expect reasonable fees, but by holding back network upgrades they have helped created the problems they now face.
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:19:13

as price plummets demand to borrow goes up because they expect a price rebound, and then will sell off again at 3k or whatever. these rises and falls are all speculators.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:02:22
I support compromise. I support Segwit, there is no sound technical arguement against it except miners may have to process more transaction for slightly less fees. They also don't make that arguement, which would be more understandable. I don't want to see miners suffer, but I don't want the network to suffer because of miners.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:34:11
Yup, I support both. I do think the blocking of Segwit, while acting like they aren't becomes more apparent all the time.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:08:40
this probably the best idea

yeah, also Mr &amp; Mrs Fuji.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:14:41
They have different uses, buy both. Bitcoin is the store of value, Ethereum won't ever equal Bitcoin for that. Most ethereum is held out of the market, the market cap includes all those coins. We are all behind the speculators/traders using the new Coin. By the time the herd moves onto it, they will be into the next Crypto.

Just keep your coins off any exchange that doesn't explicitly state what their plan is in case of a fork. Price might tank, but if Segwit gets in then its not going to. Move them off exchanges a few days prior to August 1st basicly. There is gonna be no liquidity, lol, exchanges are gonna freak out. If you have a good hardware wallet, I'd use that. Not sure on electrum, probably wouldn't keep them on that or mycelium, etc.

I own them both.... Eth rebounded more, but at one point it hit 310, thats a 25% drop, BTC didn't drop that much. Eth is 85% of BTC's market cap with a gazillion more coins, most of which are held out of the market. Hang onto that coin when everything hits the market, yeah right.

@_date: 2017-06-25 22:13:05
I agree, 2000 less likely then 3000, too much shifting around of cryptos right now. Some people are cashing out, some will stay in BTC.

The new target is now LN, used to be Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:55:52
The current paradigm is 1MB blocks and has been. Any change to Bitcoin requires trusting anyone telling you the change is beneficial. You clearly support miners, which is your right. I support compromise with on chain scaling and Segwit. If your here telling us that miners are the only nodes that matter, then I as a bitcoin user should assume you have an economic interest in miners having more power.

Then miners aren't in agreement, if they have all the power(which they don't). Segwit creates off chain scaling, which potentially reduces transaction fees to miners. Some miners are against Segwit because of this. Satoshi isn't saying anything currently, because he is MIA so anyone speaking for Satoshi is just guessing. Blockstream has plenty of money, Bitmain has plenty of money. The truly clueless people in this debate are ones that assume their side has no financial gain in the solution they support.

We cannot match existing transaction networks with on chain scaling. We would have to make the block sizes ALOT bigger, 2MB 8MB whatever all it does it create a new full block size. We need to do both on chain AND off chain. On chain scaling will never be able to match visa/mc.

@_date: 2017-06-07 16:30:59
And yet a group of people that are part of miners argue that zero confirmation transactions are perfectly good(ver).
I never said miners don't deserve fees, but holding back network scaling that only works through them is a problem for everyone. Everyone is fighting to be a gatekeeper, including todays large miners.
Blocksteams motivations have been the same for the past few years, it's talked about here every day. It's not up to me what you choose to believe. Bitmain didn't mention Asicboost until a chip was reverse engineered, then denied using it. They have a sliding narrative that changes as much as anyone. There will always be a new reason to work against Segwit, and someone not interested in compromise will always promote it.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:46:55
Segwit getting in will mean alot of price movement. Also the fact that it moves so much on news means it has a long way to go still, at least to more stable movement.

Nah, there will be plenty more peaks and valleys. You'll get an opportunity to buy at good prices again, and sometimes it might seem like you overpaid a bit.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:29:01
If you mine BTC, its beyond pointless, its like trading $2 for $1. If you mine alts its still very profitable, and they are Asic proof. However, more people mining each day means share of pay goes down and down.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:00:12
It won't happen in the same way, they won't be able to guarantee deposits, no federal insurance. Also Bitcoin is scarce, we just don't know how it will work yet. It's going to be massively different though.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:37:44
you can track your gains though, it will always show what you purchase at.
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:42:30
We hit daily limits on transfers, wires being seperate but take several days. If you have money loaded into your gemini account, should be able to do instant buys.
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:14:04
The other side is what happens if Segwit gets in August 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:56:28
Profitabilty is dropping fast, way too many people jumping in each day. I don't see it slowing down for awhile though, the gpu makers love it also.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:57:33
Some places people can't even sell their Eth, so they are trading to BTC and cashing out. The Bitcoin drop is alot slower % wise, but Eth definately is a big drag.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:19:52
Yup, but I still support compromise that has to include Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:38:17
Poloniex is one of , if not the best, love it. Can't get enough of it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:43:20
lol how? how does that mempool look right now?
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:53:35
I have eth also, at this point I'm just holding. I really don't know with Eth. There are just so many factors in play right now. Some people probably converted some of the selloff to stocks, but now stocks are starting to look oversold. Im just holding an watching.
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:16:48
The market doesn't care about the details, when we make money on it. If you think Bitcoin is a shitcoin, i'll buy more.
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:44:51
It would be nice if exchanges just listed both.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:51:27
OMG now I can't make it go forwards, someone help!
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:36:37
So will just increasing to 2MB blocks or 4MB blocks, full blocks in a few months again. Miners want users competing against each other to pay higher fees, off chain reduces that escalation. If you care about Bitcoin scaling affordably, you wouldn't be against Segwit.
Segwit is not assumption, beta environments, using LTC, watching data.... I can make up anything I want and say it's true also.
@_date: 2017-06-25 13:43:47
my coffee is too expensive when i pay from coinbase... /s
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:05:44
Everyone has a hand in blocking scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:27:50
When you troll with tweets, your gonna trick some people and piss them off. If he doesn't want responses like this, stop trolling.
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:45:13
LOL, whoever it is doesn't know that he is tweeting at people that are actually qualified to spot fake tweets.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:18:28
I bought more...
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:22:46
Cryptos are not a bubble, Bitcoin is not a bubble, just watch the currency trading markets, its like a drug for stock guys.
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:50:29
Come on not a position anyone has ever taken...
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:36:08
Today was quite the drop, but not nearly the biggest or baddest. It's having issues with selloffs right now at 3k, but eventually will break through. We might have had large holders dump coins, because of Tech crash panic also, who knows. I bought more today, but I missed the very bottom.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:17:00
Probably not, hehe, at least he didn't mention MLM, thats on rbtc.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:48:40
They know it will influence price, and they can buy more for less.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:29:34
Segwit happening is the best outcome for everyone, bitcoin instantly gains value. Miners hold coin just like users.
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:11:07
switch to poopcoin, there are no fees
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:11:33
Ask them what they want a currency backed by? There are positives and negatives to either side. If they say backed by a government, show them world debt and wasteful spending figures. Someone is allowed to say I see no value in Bitcoin, just don't take it personally. For alot of people, the lightbulb has to go off. Once it does they get it, but until then all you can do is just explain your position.
@_date: 2017-06-22 21:30:16
Not if your mining bitcoin, you can rent hash power for other things which are profitable and then convert to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:37:49

Andreas Antonopoulos is my guess, but probably not him, who knows. I just like him because he sees next week, next year, and further ahead.
@_date: 2017-06-30 19:59:25
I don't really care what he says, and Im not a troll....
I don't understand why any well run professional company wants to be represented by that type of behavior.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:45:19
I went to a universe where Satoshi didn't disappear, asked him this question, and then came back here.
@_date: 2017-06-01 20:59:30
Ask questions, keep an open mind, compromise probably needs to happen at some point. There is alot of economic incentive on either side. Segwit is good, LN is very good, on chain scaling is good. It's important to make sound careful updates to bitcoin to ensure stability and security. Core has several hundred participants, most of which don't work for Blockstream.
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:50:23
nouriel roubini was also percieved as right predicting a financial crash even though he did it every single day, be careful with these guys and their predictions
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:03:08
Yes they will, it's one of the only instant BTC options though, and you pay for it.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:32:09
No one has to use it.... If you want instant payment processing for your business, open an LN channel. There are a bunch of competing L2 solutions. There is probably plenty of room for many. This is coming from a contingent of large businesses saying other large businesses are bad. Just say we are making lots of money with the status quo, and are resistant to change.
@_date: 2017-06-28 13:10:06
It was alot more dangerous years ago for many reasons. Then Prince died last year, so his secret will never come out.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:25:18
BTC LTC, but cost average in over time always, buy some once a week or something
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:05:33
Great, we need to organize a revolt to stop mempool spammers from driving up transaction fees!
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:02:19
Then why block segwit in favor of on chain scaling first, I guess it just doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:36:22
Forbes is full of idiots, every new article just proves it. They haven't been a good source of financial news for a long time. They really are just a tabloid dressed up as something else.
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:29:26
wrong, no more covert use....
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:03:59
Sure it does if your objective.
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:43:29
Governments understanding the potential inflation Cryptos may cause, especially with weaker fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:15:41
thanks i figured, i don't mind making them look stupid though, you can only argue bad logic so far.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:35:34
Bitmain is really really good at trolling.... It sucks, but that is what they are doing, it's not funny, but they aren't good for the space.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:18:27
or we could just leave the block size limit unchanged, since we can't agree on how to move forward, and just stay with status quo.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:02:54
yeah no shit, but they are all crashing...
@_date: 2017-06-25 23:26:10
Thats been going on for awhile now, we don't get the dips we used to with BTC anymore for example. New users see the buying opportunity that old hodlers don't, because we all bought at much less.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:33:55
yes I do, and everyone backed out, miners and developers.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:07:33
It blocks improvements to Bitcoin, that would also lower the fees Bitmain collects per block. It goes against their own economic interests, but I'd rather them say that then come up with fake reasons for fixing Asicboost and Blocking Segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:06:01
Really just loss of network integrity.
