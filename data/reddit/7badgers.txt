Silly comment because....
By the time you have reached 10 years of age you know enough about hot drinks to avoid getting burnt.
As is clear from the posts on here there are many so called "investors" who fail to appreciate the risk associated with putting a large (in some case all !) part of their savings into buying crypto-currency, usually Bitcoin. These are  novice investors and a warning is most appropriate I think.

It's possible xxx is just a passing fad, and it could be replaced by a better yyy later.
Presumably this is a reference to x=bitcoin y=crypto.
But what about horse and cart / transport
OR videotape / recording media.
Really you can find just as many silly "no" examples in history as "yes" examples, so saying something like this about bitcoin only really expresses your own (biased ? / fixed) opinion anyway.
It is absolutely TRIVIAL for anyone to invent / set up a new crypto (there are over 200 already) so the possibility of one overtaking bitcoin if it is promoted by a large company or even government is not insignificant. Just becasue bitcoin was first to market does not make it the automatic long term winner !

Please make up your mind whether it is the concept or idea of Bitcoin which you support (hence price in fiat $ is irrelevant)
You want to make money on it as an investment (which, of course, it is not as the price continues to fall).

You have missed my point. I am well aware that the current "in the wild" cryptos are , to a greater or lesser extent, afflicted with many of the same defects as Bitcoin. The currency I speak of is not "magical", it is being worked on right now but has not been finalized and therefore not (yet) released to the public.
The barriers to entry with respect to launching a new crypto are virtually zero, anyone can have a go at it. So far the alt-coins spawned in this environment have mainly been Bitcoin copy-cats with a variable level of "tweaking" and the originators have mainly been individuals or small teams simply out to "make a buck". The serious matter of developing a future winner for crypto space has been carried out by large organizations in a different "area". 
Although Bitcoin was first to market it has not been handled properly from a product development perspective and there is no realistic hope that this will change significantly in the near future. It really is dying now as the fiat $ price drags its reputation lower.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:33:46
I had my suspicions that the order book on Mt.Gox was not entirely legit for some time. This has been mentioned on reddit before. There were a numbers of patterns which were not typical of exchange order books and could have been dishonest fictional entries by Mt.Gox themselves, in other words "market manipulation". It was impossible to test/check this or alert any authority to these suspicions because, of course, Bitcoin exchanges are unregulated ! 
As a side to this it would of course be possible to simply have book entries for customers BTC holdings (no real BTC) where they had bought from a ficticious "phantom" order book seller.

Whether Bitcoin will (or can ?) be regulated by existing authorities (all centralized of course) is a bit of a work-in-progress right now. I suspect (much) more regulation is coming, possibly quite soon. It is possible this may well stifle (or kill ?) Bitcoin, at the very least it will make things different ! Unfortunately despite a good 1 year of serious criminality associated with Bitcoin the authorities have not got involved except at the edges. Too many ordinary innocent people have lost real hard earned money in this "experiment". Too many scammers have made themselves rich. In these circumstances the only real chance of reducing the level of criminality must come from actions by bitcoiners themselves. As with most criminal activity there will be many people who are not directly involved but who know something, they have some evidence. I am asking them now to come forward with that evidence and to act.
(Good luck with being a dirty statist fiat user but you could be a clean one if you bought some hemp soap as they do take $ as well as BTC.)

No, I think it is best to let it spectacularly fail  This will draw attention to the highly undesirable "unregulated" nature of bitcoin exchanges. If bitcoin fails as a result so be it. This will hasten the development of a useful crypto that could replace fiat because bitcoin is most certainly not a contender for that crown any more !

That is very illogical for 2 reasons:
Firstly it is silly to even look at the business details/ business model unless you have trust in the person proposing it.(You are putting the cart before the horse!) and Secondly your proposed method means each individual has to do the screening themselves. Some may be poor at this and will therefore be scammed.
And Thirdly (Using the Monty Python Spanish Inquisition theory) surely what you suggest is what has happened in the past and loads of people have indeed been scammed out of there hard earned money.
It is not a harsh regulation to ask the people behind a business to be upfront about who they are, their past business history and to post a recent photograph. The only bits of the economy which will be strangled are the dishonest bits which is what we want to achieve. We also want to achieve a situation where we protect to a greater degree all members of the community, both the inexperienced and more experienced , by providing a more transparent and open situation than currently exists. 
History (of Bitcoin) shows that even experienced and savvy people have lost out to dishonest businesses in the past. Your suggestion does not tackle the issue and in fact you make no new suggestions for doing things differently. Surely you cannot think what has happened to date is in anyway acceptable ? Or do you ?

I dont think most of the criminals in the bitcoin scams are trying to destroy the cryptocurrency, they are trying to extract money from the gullible participants and it makes sense for them to see bitcoin thrive so they can get more people scammed.
There may well be some people or organisations who would like to see bitcoin fail, and there may be some acting to aid this but the evidence is sketchy and usually such claims appear to be paranoia on here. e.g. Claims against so called trolls (who correctly point out a defect in the workings of Bitcoin) and it is claimed they are paid to do so by the banks !

She may be right, we think its about 50/50 of either the start of the end or a possible consolidation at around $400 before moving again (up or down). Finely balanced but the bad news coming out about BFL and other "scams" may turn the tide to the former if its not going there already.
The truth is there are very few participants except early adopters (pre Nov 2013) who are currently sitting on a profit and there are a vast number who are on a significant loss. A fair % of those will not (as previously advised) only "bought what they can afford to lose" and have overextended themselves or even gone all in. These players are selling now and will continue to do so as the decreasing price drives more of them out of BTC and into what little fiat they can now salvage from their investment.
They are probably the wise ones ! The foolish ones will be those who watch (and do nothing) as we see 350,300,250,200.....
There may be a bounce upwards at sometime from somewhere and there will be renewed "howling at the Moon!" but I suspect it will be short lived.
Seriously, if you have not got out now, please do some very careful thinking. Unless your financial position is secure the risk profile is exceedingly high. A crash to very low levels (the end of Bitcoin ?) must have a high probability from this position.

But we have now established that in practical functional terms the Bitcoin system will function in EXACTLY the same way irrespective of who "owns" the computing power of the nodes. In fact it is opaque and users of Bitcoin have no knowledge of the independence or otherwise of the nodes when using Bitcoin. So lets try and clear this up for once and for all. What EXACTLY is the great benefit that Bitcoin is going to bring to mankind ? Because if it is not related to the actual functionality (which an identical crypto can provide with all nodes owned by, say, Google) and it is not obvious to users as to whether it is decentralised or not, then what on earth is it ? Just an idea of liberty ??

A lot of previous predictors have made the point it is binary, hence the don't invest more than you can afford to lose.

When buying your stocks, bonds &amp;, real estate you had a wide choice of products and no doubt considered various alternatives before purchasing your chosen selection. I expect you also diversified your holdings across several different stocks to diversify/mitigate your risks.
When deciding to invest in Bitcoin did you consider the other cryptocurrencies that existed ? Did you diversify into other cryptos ? or is all your investment in this area only in the one, Bitcoin ? If so why ?
Just suppose another better crypto comes along and overtakes Bitcoin, where will you be then. As I have said before Bitcoin has no unique properties that cannot be copied (it is open source peer-peer and hence copiable at will and zero cost).

This is the end of Bitcoin, far too many problems with it for it to be useful in the real world for everyday coinsumers (sic). Seriously damaged by all the bad news, thefts, hacks, closing exchanges, association with illegality, etc.
However it is not the end of cryptocurrencies, I expect to see new ones emerging specifically designed to avoid Bitcoins faults and also appeal to the mass market. Perhaps something along the lines of bit-Dollar with its exchange value fixed/pegged.
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:25:51
You completely miss the point. These are criminals. Of course the business model and information is going to be made to look as convincing as possible by the scammer. You NEED to check out the people behind the business, you need to look into things much more carefully when it involves bitcoin because the amount of money stolen / scammed to date in Bitcoin's history is FUCKING HUGE !
We need to do everything we can to expose the criminality that currently infests Bitcoin. We cannot rely on anyone else to do this for us - we need to do it ourselves. This is do-able. There is lots of talent out there with regard to being computer-savvy and it only takes a little bit of effort to do the research to find links between names, addresses, companies and even pictures.

I think it simply quite likely that a large number of "speculative" holders are unwinding their positions or reducing them. Even "to the moon" guys might be selling a bit hoping to pick up cheaper later on. The graph is very up/down not a simple down slope so there is still 2 way trading. Do not forget the high was $1240, there will be many who got in at $600-1200 for the first time and are seeing a loss, quite a few will be novices and will be somewhat jittery if not actually in panic mode ! 
There is also the overhang of siezed silk road coins, Mt.Gox "ooh look what I found" coins and probably a fair few chunks of illegally snaffled coins that various thieves will need to convert into quckly spendable fiat. 
Expect a continued drop until the next big news item which might be + or -.
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:40:48
As Willy and Mt.Gox are long dead we can assume that there are the following "supporting" the price.
1) Day traders / speculators who will be working in a certain range and possibly manipulating it to some degree. They may get caught out by a move either below their low range or above their high but we estimate that most of the exchange based BTC transaction volume is such traders so really they are "in control" to some degree although competing against one another in this net zero sum game.
2)For ordinary (non trading) bitcoin enthusiasts there is a "belief" in it. Whether they think it is going to the moon next month/year or simply think longer term it will be a winner. These participants are unlikely to sell as it goes lower but more likely to top up their holdings with "cheap coins". This may however be diminished if the price drops too low too fast as they will become either frightened or waiting for it to go lower.
3)As all bitcoin exchanges are totally unregulated there may well be further price manipulation and other bots running. We just have no way of telling. This may be engineered to keep the price from falling too far as it will be in their interests not to see it fail.

In order for eBay (owner of PayPal) to maintain its margin in fees/charges (and hence maintain annual profits and keep shareholders happy) it is necessary to ensure that any *new* currency gets treated the same as old fiat and passes through its *system* so it can still charge the same (or more !) transaction fees.
Once BTC is integrated expect to see other altcoins follow soon after. This is more likely to be an "insurance policy" for PayPal just in case any crypto gets leverage and starts to be adopted mainstream. And it also gets the current free publicity associated with any bitcoin adopting merchants.

2)Non existent Data Centre.(Claimed they owned it but it does not exist).
3)Fictional shareholders.(Claimed many investors but in reality far fewer).
4)Fictional bitcoin space companies.(Existing only in their minds and on the computer, fictional reports and news.)
I think a sweepstake on who is going to jail first might be in order !!
Seriously , guys, I don't claim to have the same investigative expertise as some of the journalists from the FT which I have worked with in the past but if you just put in a bit of time on google, facebook, linkedin, etc and research the names of some of the CEOs in the bitcoin space you will learn some VERY INTERESTING facts. 
I am not revealing my information just yet (my book will be available next year) but why don't you put as much effort into checking out your so called "investments" as you do in writing (very well I may say) your computer code/ software ? 
There are very many "con artists" now operating in the bitcoin space and if you truly believe in the cryptocurrency why not do something about it and get these scammers outed. Surely bitcoin will only benefit if it has HONEST players in it ? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:21:45
We agree that the interesting questions have nothing to do with the price today and everything to do with the 5-10y future possibilities for cryptocurrencies. However we see nothing in the history of Bitcoin or its technical specifications which lead us to believe it has a high probability of being the winner in future crypto-space.
Bitcoin has demonstrated itself to be insecure, difficult to use, not a store of value and generally risky on many fronts as to its potential for real world use by ordinary Joe Public.
Furthermore the faults and defects in bitcoin have been well known, talked about extensively on and elsewhere and yet over the last 12 months the efforts to correct these failings have been piss poor to say the least.  It is much more likely that the winner in future crypto-space (in 5-10y) will be a new coin which has been designed from scratch not to have Bitcoin's problems, which is supported and backed by a large organization and/or government and will probably be pegged to a secure fiat, like $.
For those of you who thought this was all about libertarianism, freedom and a new world order  I regret to say you were mistaken. The future of cryptocurrency is as a trusted parallel alternative to fiat which can be used by ordinary coinsumers. They have no interest in the political ideals of Satoshi or other cult members but every interest in trusting that their "money" in whatever form is secure and safe and insured.
RIP Bitcoin - Long Live Cryptocurrency.

Yes, I was thinking a sponsored crypto would just have its own nodes/servers running and probably very little mining owing to inefficient wastage of electic.

This sub is full of redditors "advising" people to put all their money into bitcoin, fill their boots, go all in, do not buy any other coins,never sell bitcoin, always hold (hodl) bitcoin and similar so for you to suggest it is "VERY bad advice..." to put half into bitcoin and half for trading seems rather biased to say the least. 
To me it seems a very sensible idea to split your investing money up and there have been loads of people on here talking about their experiences with trading bitcoin and how they increased their holdings. Daenerys seems to be suggesting a system which has a free trial anyway so I fail to see how that can be a bad idea. Buying bitcoin directly  was a bad idea for those who had it on Mt.Gox or any other exchange that scammed them. I like the thought of the CFD as it looks like there is very little risk of losing ones coins due to dishonesty/carelessness. 
And if putting half your funds into trading bitcoin AFTER trying it out for free is VERY BAD then presumably putting ALL your funds into just bitcoin itself must be MUCH WORSE I would think .
TL:DR Your view looks biased/skewed somewhat.

Answer it honestly with your opinion.
"No it is not and it won't ever be. There are too many serious problems with bitcoin. For example its unregulated nature, in particular unregulated exchanges, and also the numerous reports of thefts, scams and forever "lost" BTC.
Bitcoin is now doomed to fail. It maybe that the lessons learnt will result in a new crypto currency which solves these problem but that is a little time in the future. For the present it is better to avoid the whole cryptocurrency area and just watch.There are lots of inexperienced investors currently holding bitcoins and prices are dropping daily. I expect the whole thing will be dead within a few weeks or months."

Not entirely. I am actually as a believer in the huge possibilities for crypto in the future (and that's probably a 5-10y from now minimum) but  I think bitcoin will probably have no part to play in that future whatever happens from now. It may have been first to market but events have proved it's general unsuitability for real world use and the criminal infestation will taint its image forever.

For your purposes Bitcoin is one of the least desirable wealth storage options. There is a significant probability that the purchasing value will be, in 2-4y , massively less than your initial conversion, possibly even zero. Virtually any other asset will have a better probability of retaining value in that timescale.
Furthermore there are considerable difficulties to be overcome with regard to both the conversion to BTC (and from BTC later) and the technicalities of security.
You are likely to find high value metals, diamonds, collectable coins with gold content,or physical cash a much better option.

Ask-the-designer. Seriously go back to the beginnings and have a look at the history of bitcoin, bit-gold, the NSA 1996 paper,Nick Szabos writings, etc.
Now see if you can 
a)Find out who designed it.
b)Find out why.
We continue our research along these lines and find it VERY interesting that a lot of effort went into obscuring the identities of both Satoshi and Nick. Remember this was at a time when bitcoins had no value whatsoever yet the effort expended was large. Also we consider it highly unlikely that 35,000 lines of virtually flawless and fully functioning code can be the work of one lone enthusiast. Recent theories about Satoshi's early mining may well indicate he had up to 58 computers running. Now ask yourself where he is likely to be doing that.
I suggest it is highly risky putting real world hard earned $ into this as a "gamble" when you have no concrete idea where it came from and why. It is even more risky to delude yourselves into thinking it is some kind of libertarian world changing el-dorado when in reality there is a high probability of it being deliberately engineered at significant cost and effort by an unseen unknown organization with (and this is the best part) an aim which we have no knowledge of.

1.mid 2013, mainstream media.
2,3,4,: I keep telling you "IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PRICE" !!!!
The fact that so many of you are obsessed with the price (usually in $) and consider bitcoin as an opportunity to profit/make yourselves rich (without doing any real work) is going to be the real underlying reason why Bitcoin will not be the ultimate winner in crypto-space and will be overtaken in the next few years by a much better alt-coin. If you had spent your efforts on improving this crypto and getting rid of its defects instead of trading it and/or stealing it amongst yourselves you might have come up with a winner, unfortunately you didnt, and others are now working on a real world USEFUL and PRACTICAL crypto which is likely to appeal to ordinary memebrs of the public as opposed to fans of drugs and weird libertarian politics.
You shot yourselves in the foot really because it is not about the price.

Can't work, won't work, waste of time.
Whatever system is set up or comes into existence in a free world anybody holding bitcoin can trade however they like for whatever they like at any time outside the system for completely different values, so suppose 2000 holders do that, and then set up Mt.Gox 2.0 (you could not stop them),you then have 2 systems running with 2 values, clearly most intelligent people will see the arbitrage and move to wherever is the advantage (freedom !),your system collapses.

Cars are just cars, money (especially a world currency) is rather more important. It matters immensely who made it and why. Seeing what it does really does not help us understand why and the fact that it is open source does not help enough either. I suggest that there is not one single person in bitcoin who can explain the design and function of all 35,000 lines of the code. It is extremely difficult to back engineer software. We have had a little involvement in vintage computer restoration and trying to reconstruct/repair something as simple as a 1970's compiler is very taxing. "Cryptographically verify it" is a completely meaningless phrase, sure we can check certain functions (to see that they work) but it does not throw any light on the why and wherefore.
I continue to research this area in depth, if you have a specific claim you want me to explain in more detail I will be glad to elaborate and explain the data sources I have used.

You get it ! ONLY if Bitcoin is used for a vast amount of real goods/services transaction will a high price be justified. The current use for real world activity is only a tiny fraction of the 60-80K per day, most is "trading" on exchanges. The price should "follow" the activity but currently has got way, way ahead of the fundamentals. i.e. It has been hyped up to levels which are unjustified by the adoption rate. clearly the hyped "too-high" level is not holding &amp; it will, in all probability continue to decline for the forseeeable future, albeit with extreme volatility. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 20:26:17
The proposal at present clearly states it is just for exchanges so presumably other businesses relating to Bitcoin and the personal transactions between individuals are not included. 
Whether a pseudo exchange like localbitcoins is included or not seems unclear but I suspect it will be included as the consumer "target" is the same.
Expect to see vetting of persons running exchanges to check for criminal record, etc. Detailed AML rules regarding taking full details off customers (no more underage kids !) and a risk warning being mandatory.
As always the devil is in the detail but Bitcoin enthusiasts / representatives have an opportunity here to help mould the regulation so hopefully some will step up to the mark and act with some grown up thinking here. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:50:29
More like $100 on Mt.Gox and sub $600 elsewhere. A continued fall is predicted and it won't be coming back. This crypto is dying minute by minute. Simply open your eyes and see all the problems with Bitcoin, its unregulated nature, the unregulated exchanges, the thefts, the hackers, etc, etc. Absolutely no chance this is going to be a useful currency for the ordinary man-in-the-street. Just going to be a plaything for geek's, and at somewhat nearer to $0 than it is now.

@_date: 2014-10-29 18:31:12
Nonsense. If a seriously better crypto arises which has attractive features and is sponsored by a big organisation with some network (mining /nodes) already running it could gain rapid traction for real world good/services with JoE Public. In such case bitcoin could be overtaken quite rapidly.
If a defect in bitcoin causes it to fail, stop working, corrupted ledger, etc it might take a long time for it to be fixed. Transactions will then transfer to one of the existing altcoins as people will have very little patience in this scenario.

OK, it is self evident that any muti-computer system needs to be dispersed or have backup for the building burning down so lets leave that point as trivial shall we ?
Government shut it down ? OK, so if the "one company" owner of Bitcoin nodes puts them in 100 different buildings in 100 different countries we solve that issue and the first (would need co-ordinated shut down legislation in 100 countries to shut it so thats impossible).

Exactly, they have not confiscated bitcoins, and the bitcoins were not in a wallet on his computer. Bitcoins are virtual, if they exist anywhere it is simply on the ledger (the blockchain). What the authorities got hold of was some "keys", simply private passwords if you like, which the protocol of bitcoin will allow you to use to move the ledger entry. Please try to remember , all you are keeping on your computer (or paper) is a supposed-to-be-secret string of characters  and it is self evident that there can be as many copies of it as anyone desires. Once you grab hold of this, not storing bitcoins, just storing private keys, you begin to understand the secrecy and security implications.

Your reply seems to suggest that you think all the losses suffered by scammed investors were due to their own failure to correctly assess the business model. You even say this is true for Neo &amp; Bee and suggest that any experienced business specialist would not have been scammed as they would have spotted it was not a worthy investment. So you put the "fault" upon the unfortunate ones who have lost money.
Sorry, my friend, but in a civilised 21st Centuary society that is just not good enough.  The FUNDAMENTAL reason why people lost money is due to the intent of the criminals. You cannot simply accept a high percentage of activity in Bitcoin being run by criminals and leave it to individuals to say yes or no to each one. It is a ridiculous proposition which leaves the weaker and inexperienced open to huge losses.
There are several avenues of research which are open to the more experienced on here and we can do this work, post our results and assist those that are disadvantaged. I fail to see any negative implications for this except for those who are dishonest.

Each concept has its place. With regard to Plus500 there is indeed no holding of any assets and no dealing in BTC. It all depends on what you want to achieve. The advantages, as we see it, are that there is a totally fiat regulated system here and you are therefore extremely unlikely to lose any money due to exchange dishonesty, exchange hacks, etc. They trade so many other stocks and commodities  as well so we trust they are not going to do any manilulation either (c.f. Bitfinex "speed bumps" earlier). The fee structure and "models" are all standard stock market margin trading tools and easily researched plus the company itself lets you set up a free and unlimited test trading operation where you can just play with it to your heart's content until you are happy to go live with real money.
I actually think the fact that they hold no BTC is an advantage in these turbulent times.

Your reply is very interesting (and strange). 
Firstly Satoshi was, shall we say, the inventor of bitcoin. I am talking about the *associated* companies/organizations which are taking money off people. We have a right to know who is behind them and a right to "check out their credentials". bitcoin is relatively unregulated by existing LEAs or financial monitors so we need to do this ourselves.
Secondly I think it is very interesting that you say "the point of owning Bitcoin". I tend to talk about the point of Bitcoin, or the point of cryptocurrencies. Why the emphasis on "owning it" ? If, as I suspect, your angle is that the point is to make money / become wealthy then surely it must follow that you are likely to make far more if you can eliminate the criminals who are sucking wealth out of it like parasites ?

It is not easy to extract correct verifiable figures but our best guess, based on what we can get and the reading of news items is:
Merchant adoption is still tiny and not increasing significantly.
Actual real world use for goods services (excluding drugs/porn/etc) is insignificant.
Earlier adopting merchants are getting no significant bitcoin sales now so are likely to drop it.
Speculators are wary as the price seems a one way decline and there are too many worries about exchange manipulation.
Ordinarly small hodlers/investors are getting tired of waiting for the moon trip and are unlikely to be adding to their hodlings.
Continued downward BTC/$ trending is reducing interest in ETF, GABI and the like so we are unlikely to see any positive news in that space.
Foundation continues to be lacklustre, very little work by devs in improving the protocol for real world use.
Extreme centralization of mining in large farms remains a worry both for 51% attack and unfriendly country associations (China). 
These really add up to a lot of nails being banged into the coffin lid of Bitcoin. Probably going to fall off its perch for good by the end of Q1 2015 .

You should realize that as merchant adoption in tiny (as a % of real world volume) that bitcoin would work just as well for merchants at $100, or $10 or even $1 currently. the only, Yes ONLY, thing holding the price higher than $1 is the expectation of certain hodlers/investors that it will soon be going up. 
It won't. It has being going down for 10 months now from the ATH and will continue to do so unless and until merchant adoption gains some real traction. Be realistic. What are the chances of that happening quickly or significantly over the next 12 months ? Quite a low probability I reckon.

We had an account with one of them which paid 1% per month compound interest and never got less than 98% of daily spot for gold.

Well with Plus500 it is fully regulated in the jurisdictions in which it is legal (actually the USA is the only place AFAIK where you cannot use them), the company is properly audited every year, they publish annual reports,their shares are quoted on the Uk stock market so they have to comply with all their listing requirements and all their trading rules are published and fixed. This seems a world removed from bitfinex who recently have made up rules as they go along. I fail to see how anyone can suggest Plus500 is a worst place to deal than bitfinex. How exactly do you assess trust in a completely unregulated area like bitcoin exchanges anyway ? You can simply get round the need to by using a company like Plus500 which exists in the highly regulated world of fiat. Far, far safer.
I do agree that if you want to deposit bitcoin or pay in bitcoin it is no good though but evidence of past exchange disasters would seem to indicate that there is a significant risk of loss and/or manipulation in that space.

If you are going to accept any kind of token with some hopes for the future then surely it makes sense to only consider ones that are reasonably free of cheating, to choose one which you know involves many cheaters would seem to be voluntarily stupid.

Very enterprising of them, as one would expect. Although it is no more than a glorified calculator averaging some figures.
Might be useful if bitcoin has a future and I expect they may make money out of it. Of course it helps to "promote" their ETF which is probably their prime reason for this invention.
Unfortunately I think they are too late in the game and bitcoin ETF will never materialise because bitcoin itself is now effectively DEAD. Dying as I write with far too many problems, security difficulties, stolen/lost coins,association with Silk Road(s),Sheep Market, closed (scamming) exchanges, and Mt.Gox fiasco.

The China/Russia currency swap agreements recently announced are certainly a departure from transacting everything via USD but it is a new venture for both of them and will likely take 5y or more before both are sufficiently comfortable with it to want to extend it further. In those 5y of course it will be imperative that neither side "antagonizes" the other politically. I wouldn't bet on this being more than a 50/50. Whether this has any significant effect on USD status is also highly subjective but long term (15y ?) it might. However Russia/China although large by no means dominate world trade and it would seem highly unlikely that either of them , or any of the other BRICS will want to weaken their own currency and their own economic control to any extent.

I am so glad you said nothing about the price. Can we wait until it gets to about $10, please, so all the greedy little neckbeards have been ejected from the bitcoin space before we start working on the new world order ?
This should also help remove the criminal and dishonest element that have infested it and a prolonged reduction in the price should also remove some of the near centralized mining set ups.
In short, in order for bitcoin to succeed, we need to see the price back near single digit dollars and the efforts from those who are left in it will then be directed towards altering it to make it suitable for the new world order.
Bitcoin was effectively ruined as soon as monetary greed entered the equation and the speculators and criminals jumped on board.

In order to replicate AI machines it is only necessary to analyse the hardware (presumably the same for each model), the software (easy to dump the code out) and the memory contents (copy it).
To do the same for a human I believe you would effectively need analysis to molecular level, human "components" are not identical between humans in the same way that all M860037/B integrated circuits are identical. For the human there will be many subtle differences in the component building blocks, internal wiring, memory, etc. this would be impossible to replicate in the same way as a machine. Even the most complicated of machine will be made of a finite number of discrete components which I can source, weld/solder/assemble to produce an identical hardware version which once it has all the same "bits" (0s &amp; 1s) in it will behave EXACTLY the same. It is irrelevant to my point that 2 such AI machines will diverge in future performance due to subtle input differences because at any time I can still replicate exactly from the time I "stop" the machine.
Are there any current historical examples of determining human behaviour based on analysis which you can cite to support your point ?
What is the relevance of "neural networks" ?
Need more input.

As previously mentioned by me, and you, and your cousins and just a very few enlightened others here. Of course there will be more who hold this opinion / theory / prediction but unfortunately;
1)Reddit moderators have censored or effectively banned some from expressing their opinion here.
2)Reddit down voting has effectively hidden such opinions due to "score below threshold" censoring.
3)Reddit bitcoin is so clearly biased towards pro-bitcoin hyping that those holding such views see little point in posting/replying so they don't.
4)Many pro-bitcoiners are just plain rude and offensive when replying to comments which are not to their liking.
In short Bitcoin is so unsuitable as a worldwide currency it is effectively DEAD now, forever doomed to be simply a "geeks" toy. I think, _08, we will let them play with it but I think we must insist that they do so quietly in their own rooms and not keep bothering the rest of us with this silliness. If they keep insisting they want others to like it then we MUST keep advising the general public that this is a very dangerous thing where they may well lose real money.

Nice post and sensible sentiment. Unfortunately I have a horrible feeling that the only ones left here on who are not paid funbux supporters are r/buttcoin visitors so you may be preaching to a somewhat empty Church. 
News just in as I write; it is now down to 5 Californian guys.
The other point to ponder is the fact that all the bitcoin exchanges are open order book driven. So for every seller there must be a buyer. Although quite a lot of the former hodlers may well have got out relatively recently there must eventually come a point where the buying dries up compared to the selling and then we really will see a freefall in the price.
The decline seen so far has not been very steep in historical terms compared to some stock market flops, Tulip bubbles and the like. We need to see 10-20% falls PER DAY before a freefall situation can be declared. Assuming, of course, that no exchanges are rigging the price a-la-Goxxy.

ITS NOT ABOUT THE PRICE.
Move away from the bitcoin exchange right now ! We do not need greedy lazy get-rich-quick dreamers in crypto at this stage. We need people working on getting it in a fit state for useful and practical real world use for goods and services by the ordinary coinsumer. Bitcoin has been around for 6 years now and it is still a crawling and mewling child not an adult capable of walking upright in the real world of commerce.
You need to move away from the price and concentrate on the other stuff for the next 3-5y. This reality is beginning to sink in and the price will be falling for quite a while yet as a result.

Useful info. For UK and Europe the company Plus500 does a nice line in CFD/margin trading on bitcoin and lots of other stuff and as it is originating as a stock market and commodities trading platform it is fully regulated and audited unlike the bitcoin exchanges of this world. This is an excellent and safe way to trade, check them out, they are a sound established company and you can even see their annual report, etc. (Quoted on the stock market too). Fees are very reasonable, bitcoin contracts expire monthly which gives you plenty of time for your strategy to develop.

Seriously though anyone can "invent" a dream, we could have 1,000 different ones on here tomorrow. One of the problems with bitcoin (and bitcoin enthusiasts, especially on is that there are too many people living in fantasy land and not enough REALITY in their thinking.
The future winner in crypto space will be the crypto that the vast majority of the general public like, find easy to use, is free from significant risk of theft, carries some "insurance" against dodgy merchants (chargebacks) and is stable, reliable and relatively free from criminality.

What we need in bitcoin space is not just order book exchanges but open market auctions. Large BTC holdings from e.g. miners, early adopters, my interesting chemical for sale lab, etc can be offered at , say, 1200Hrs each day for auction. You could have closed (hidden) auctions as well as open (visible bidding/price), maybe even Dutch auctions (price starts high and reduces until sold). This would help establish some true visibiity in large size deals and give greater opportunities for both buyers and sellers. There would also be a degree of "fixing" the true price after the auctions as a guide for the orderbook exchanges. Handles correctly this looks like a useful business idea for someone, the auctioneer can act as the escrow/trusted 3rd party.

Meanwhile in a secret location in fiat central real business leaders are working on a USEFUL crypto that stands a chance of being adopted worldwide, or at least by a big country.
Clue: It will have centralized mining, be pegged to a fiat, be insured against loss/theft, be easy for ordinary Joe Public to use, be trackable and have a chargeback facility.

Please re-read my replies, I seek to promote discussion not derail it.
Repeating an argument you believe in is perfectly normal and is commonly seen here on r/bitcoin to a massive degree from pro-bitcoin enthusiasts. You cannot have one rule for the pros and another for the antis, that is not democracy or free speeech but is censorship. Furthermore the pro-bitcoiners often ignore counter arguments themselves and apear to avoid discussion by shouting "troll" , calling people idiots or using abusivre and foul language.
IF r/bitcoin participants could try to be a little more adult, sensible, polite and open to fair discussion of points without being so unhelpful I am sure discussions could help enlighten both sides of the argument.

4)Some people will gamble about anything however stupid the odds are.
5)Maybe related to why some localbitcoin exchanges take place at up to 100% higher price than e.g.mtGox (when it was working - haha !). i.e. buyers willing to pay much more than "market" price - probably due to ignorance.

But they have not been yet and therefore there is little argument for saying that Bitcoin will be the long term winner in crypto space.

I don't see it like that. There have been moves by banks to develop "new" payment systems, e.g. Barclay's PINGIT and I think a regulated type of crypto will be devised by one or more of the big financial institutions which learns from Bitcoins defects and becomes a useful everyday currency. Actually Bitcoin is only used / owned by a tiny percentage of the population so it does not have "public trust" anyway, well only with a select minority.

@_date: 2013-12-12 20:48:38
I have noticed a couple of things in the last few days:
1)Mt.Gox bid side order book is "unreal" in my opinion. There are repeated bids of significant size at exactly  $5.00 intervals generally increasing in size as the price lowers. These are always there whatever the price range and their total is within a narrow band of 30-36% of the total bid side. I am calling these out as "highly suspicious". If they are manufactured (not real) it would give the false impression that there is a degree of underpinning (potential buyers) as the price falls. Effectively a false market.
2)The tone on reddit has changed in the last 2 days. There are a couple  (at least) of other redditors apart from myself and darkwings now calling the charts as a "crash coming".
And we are getting downvoted much less and trolled/abused less. I conclude that the extreme shillers have now given up on expecting to top $1240 and are simply in panic mode and waiting to get out themselves on any slight upswings.
In short I think we are now on the  (very) bumpy down slope. No chance of seeing $1240 ever again but there might be a quick blip to $1000 at the most. Many holders are now waiting to sell but they are holding a "loss" and reluctant to do so just yet in case they can get $1000. When it gets anywhere near that the pile out will be massive and it will turn down $100-$200 in a few minutes. This will then escalate the panic and the steam roller will trundle down all the way to the bottom ($0). This will be fast and quite a spectacle. I would not be surprised if it happens before Christmas while many people are naturally distracted with other things and not chart watching every few minutes !
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:30:35
FYI Darkwings.
11:17 hrs.
MtGox Bid side order book.
Range 934.01 - 886.00.
Extraction of bids at exactly $5.00 spacing.
930(14),925(87),920(35),915(205),910(18),905(40),900(86),895(6),890(49) . Total of "suspicious" 540 BTC. Bid side total 1452 BTC . Suspicious % 37.6%. Possibly a trend of increasing % over last few days.
I have not included any bids not at exactly $5 spacing but there are a couple out there which would increase the % even more.
Please note other REDDITORS NEED NOT REPLY.  This information is for DW &amp; myself. You are welcome to observe the phenomena yourself. I am keeping some records of this bid side order book and constructing graphs purely for my own (and DWs) interest  ( just to refine my crash prediction analysis).It is my own hobby, I no longer am interested in replies from pro-bitcoiners as you are all too rude and insulting and unable to engage in sensible adult conversation.

"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds"
3)The history of Mt.Gox, its owners, their bios,company structure of KKTibbane. Association with bitcoinmarkets.
4)History of exchanges, their rise and fall, compare existing exchanges with defunct ones.
5)Tone of reddit posts , comparison between reddit/bitcoin and reddit/economics.
6)Criminal activities associated with bitcoin, Silk Road, Sheep Market.
7)Lost/missing/stolen bitcoins.
8)Structure of the mathematics surrounding bitcoin. Try and do an overview and a detailed structure chart.
9)Fundamental to bitcoin is SHA256. Where did it originate, other uses, views of experts on it level of security.
10)Freedom of information requests relating to bitcoin in the UK.
11)Speculation vs Investment.
12)Discrepancies between exchanges. Why are rates different.
13)Underage involvemenet in bitcoins.
14)Collectors market for actual coins e.g. casascius.
15)AML and other money laundering regulations in various countries.
16)Comparison of price charts with other historical "bubbles".
17)Age/profession profile of bitcoin enthusiasts and speculators.
18)Mining, history of, change of hardware, mining equipment development and vendors.
19)Other cryptocurrencies.
20)CFD trading on bitcoin and other currencies.
Good luck with the thesis, I will be very interested to see it when done. You could approach this subject from very many angles (bias) but to do so in an unbiased scientific way will be very challenging I fear. Opinion about it seem to be changing almost on a daily basis and to some extent only time will tell who is right and who is wrong. Whether now is the start, middle or even near the end of bitcoin is yet to be seen. by the time you finish your thesis there is a risk you might want to rewrite 50 % of it !!

I can only give an opinion (best guess ?) as I have no specific inside information (yet ?) but it is possible they may have the ability to shut it down. I don't think your word "illegally" has any relevance. My thoughts are as follows:
1)There will be already in place a practically executable plan to shut down communications networks external to the USA in case of serious threat e.g. war scenario. This implies there is a firm ability to control (turn off/selectively restrict) such things as fibre optic networks, satellite channels, etc.
This may well extend to servers and hardware external to the USA e.g. UK &amp; other allies.
2)The NSA can reasonably be expected to be able to have the power to "crack" more cryptographic codes than we think.
This may well include SHA2 and specifically SHA256 which is one of the foundations of bitcoin. I note that SHA2 series were basically NSA "inventions" so I consider the probability that they have a backdoor is quite high despite what experts say about how secure it is.
3)There are many weak areas in bitcoin itself and various associates such as exchanges, wallet companies, etc. Barely a day goes by without some news of a hack, lost coins,missing files etc. NSA will know all of these and be ready to exploit them if necessary. They may already be doing so to some considerable extent.
4)Even on foreign soil there will be CIA operatives who will know for example; which telecom street cabinet supplies lines to Mt.Gox (so they can accidentally drive a truck into it when instructed to do so).
5)My own research in the UK leads very strongly to the conclusion that high level meetings have been held between UK &amp; USA about bitcoin and I think plans of some sort are already completed. I think UK banks have been "instructed" to close down bitcoin related business accounts.
In conclusion I think the most likely scenario is a multiple area sudden attack initiated by NSA on several aspects of the bitcoin network. Lets say ;
a)Take Mt.Gox off line.
b)Selectively disrupt international comm's relating to bitcoin.
c)Exploit backdoor to SHA256 to make large quantities of bitcoins disappear (appear to be stolen/hacked).
d)Disrupt USA bitcoin exchanges.
After a short while this will induce so much panic among bitcoin holders that a mass panic sell off will ensue when the exchanges come back on line. I believe it could all be done in a way that conceals the deliberate nature of the disruption and its origin and make it all appear as accidental/coincidental. Bitcoin will fail completely and it will be said that it was really the defects in bitcoin itself which caused it to fail (whereas in reality it was engineered).
Let me stress this is only speculation on my part, I have no specific inside information but I think that  scenario is how I would do it, not that I know anything about it, I am only a plumber, well that is what the signwriting says on my van. You know, the one that has been parked outside your house for 3 days with the funny aerial on its roof.
Actually it would be quite ironic if the real power here is the ability to crack SHA256 considering what it says on the physical bitcoins i.e. In numbers we trust .

Growing tulips is now far too much effort (like bitcoin mining),e.g. hardware required (spade,hoe,etc) plus the risk of theft when someone sneaks into your allotment overnight !
I much prefer the concept of trading tulips on an exchange (preferably unregulated) , has anyone ever done this before because I think it is a good idea to learn from others mistakes ?

I will now comment on the lost password scenario.(aka Brain wallet, etc). It is absolutely essential that you record passwords so that you can recover them in the case of wetware failure/glitch (wetware=brain for those that don't know this term). Writing them in your diary is a pretty poor option even if "disguised". It might be a bit crackable if I saw you had a lot of telephone numbers for MR &amp; MRS PIN and their family !! So try to be more inventive but not so bloody clever that you forget where you hid them. If I mention any here they will by default be useless (no longer secret). However we have seen some ideas in the movies, a common one is a letter or will hidden behind a picture. However as many of you are quite geeky I will give you a hint. Choose a place that requires access with a tool. Mr.Paranoid will tomorrow be removing the cylinder head from his SUV and getting out his engraving tools....he wont forget that experience. Mr.Devious will be "accidently" letting slip that he buried his in his allotment (which coincidentally needs the soil digging over). Mr.Stupid will be writing his on a piece of paper and stuffing it into his electric toaster. 
The one place I am avoiding is that little bauble on my cat's collar because if Orion gets squashed by a 16 wheeler its not just the cat that's fucked, it might be my whole universe.
Good luck in your enterprises and do take care of your valuables be they BTC or your loved ones.

"The Badger" tells it in black and white.
Actually it is very easy to fit any graph to another to make a point and if you study past bubble graphs they do not have the same form anyway. The real way to research this is a proper examination of what is really going on, consider the comments (both pro and anti), consider the behaviour (of individuals and associated parties,exchanges,mining rig companies). Consider the news about thefts,disappearing money,fantastic stories of millionaire geeks, etc. Weight it all up.Come to your own conclusions. It does help if you know a little about history e.g. "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" . It also helps to understand something about human psychology.
I have applied my knowledge and experience to the above and have my own conclusion. Please refer to all my previous comments and posts on this site.

It is clear if you check out the T&amp;Cs of eBay (and PayPal) that the nature of their buyer protection makes selling cryptocurrencies relatively risky. By all means continue to do it IF you are prepared to take this risk and make allowance for it but if not you will need to find another way of selling your BTC.

I think you will find if you wait long enough before getting into bitcoin that the crypto currencies will die a massive and spectacular death long before you begin to feel old. The whole bitcoin thing is really just a massive con, riddled with dishonesty and self delusion. Please stay well clear of this for your own financial safety. If you doubt what I say read this book, then decide: "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" by Charles McKay.
I am predicting that bitcoin will crash and burn sometime between this afternoon and 26th December 2014. If you still disagree after reading the above book and do start buying the crypto please at the very least print out my reply and keep it for future reference. When the great bitcoin crash comes you may well lose many $ but at least you can use the benefit of your experience to warn others of the next similar con when it comes along.

@_date: 2013-12-16 21:04:58
There are many factors now working against bitcoin/$ rate.
1) A recent rapid rise in announcements from banks, countries, etc that are anti-bitcoin.
2) A harder line in some announcements e.g. China where we are very close (I believe) to an outright ban / declaration of illegality.
3)An increase in customer complaints against exchanges particularly with respect to withdrawing fiat, but also withdrawing BTC. I suspect some exchanges are in serious trouble as the price drops and will be unable to return customers funds at all 9never mind in 6 months !).
4)A degree of panic in some redditors posts e.g. What do I do ?! I am showing a loss, do I hold, do I sell ? etc.
5)An increase in bitcoin thefts, especially large ones, where holders have no idea what happened.
6)Lack of delivery of mining hardware, severely delayed pre-oders. I suspect at least 1 company will be revealed to have scammed a significant amount of funds and had no intention (or ability) to deliver the rigs.
7)Too many naive speculators got in at a relatively high level ($800+) and will be getting extremely nervous at values in the $600-700 region.
In conclusion these all say SELL to me, whatever the value you bought at. I expect bitcoin to be very much lower within 7 days from now and also expect at least 3 or 4 more serious "announcements" from the authorities in this time too.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:22:08
Some good points ! Yes I think quality of posts will deteriorate, that is probably a common thing and I have seen it before with some other Q&amp;A type sites.
I agree that in one sense bitcoin is "catching on" but only in the sense that more people are being drawn in to buying them. 
It does however appear that a lot of very financially inexperienced people are doing so and posts seem to suggest that they are mainly doing so because they think they are going to make lots of money NOT because they believe in the IDEA of Bitcoin itself. This is classic speculative bubble territory.

Although I have generally advised against getting involved in buying bitcoins as an investment I begin to see a possible arbitrage type opportunity here along the lines of ;
SELL BITCOIN / BUY REFUSE TIPS SITES.
Or Stop Bitcoin Mining / Start Mining Rubbish Dumps (plenty of experienced dump miners in Africa I think but they don't work for BTC,maybe a bucket of rice ? ).
If you had all the time in the world though I think you could just shovel your way through the tip bucket by bucket and if you sift it properly you will probably get more gold/silver/platignum/rhodium etc than you will bitcoins plus a fair chunk of copper,wire, aluminium and the usual ferrous scrap.
I think I might just live long enough to see "tip mining" in my lifetime as we start to run out of some of the rarer earth metals and/or China stops exporting them or otherwise restricts world supply.
Copper and nickel had some serious peaks a few years back supposedly due to Chinese buying and their vast pace of industrialisation. I think this will reappear but it might be a few years time.

Inefficiency for the customer? Maybe , maybe not. Actually I am not sure that customer efficiency is a legitimate concern of a business. If you offer a number of different payment methods then giving the customer choice would seem to be more preferable than imposing an efficient payment system on a customer. Customers are funny things (!) and have their own quirks and ideas, if we give them a choice of payment methods we will probably have more customers ( and more profit). OK so some payment systems will cost us, as the business, more (your point about manual entry and bank visit). As long as we know that and still make a profit though there is no need to be concerned.
Actually I think you exaggerate the cost to you of processing a cash transaction and expect in most businesses a trip to the bank would not be necessary e.g. just stick it in the petty cash.
I would also expect that many customers who buy via the internet with a credit card sometimes take at least as long as writing a letter, I have seen some people do this and indeed have read (elsewhere) posts about spending 1/2 hr working their way through an online checkout system. Hopefully your is quicker - do you actually have any reliable feedback about how long it takes the average customer ? 
There real problem with using bitcoin for any merchant is still the extreme volatility of price compared with their fiat in their country (in which all their overheads, staff costs, taxes, etc have to be paid). If bitcoin had a fixed price parity with something its adoption could be much more rapid. That is why I think it is doomed and will be overtaken in the near future by the same kind of protocol but with something like "dollarcoin". All the advantages of a cryptocurrency but none of the wild volatility. All that is really needed is for someone / large organizsation / government to "stand in the market" and guarantee that they will always convert one dollarcoin to one dollar and vica-versa at any time free of charge.

Having just read a small sample of the numerous replies to the OP I note that a significant number use abusive or insulting language, e.g. call the OP childish, luddite ,etc (and worse). This is VERY interesting and suggests that quite a lot of the proponents of Bitcoin here appear to have anger management issues. Might I suggest that they consider going on an anger management course, or, if that does not appeal, I would respectfuly advise them to consider changing their behaviours/language so that they come across as a bit less of a c**t.

I think the banks and banking regulators know far more than we do and this "inside information" relating to bitcoin cannot (yet?) be disclosed. However they cannot leave themselves open to compensation claims should anyone loose lots of money in bitcoin while they provided banking services to such individuals or companies when they knew the losses would be likely/possible/certain. So their only course currently open is to close the accounts of bitcoin related businesses and individual.

Bitcoin market are not regulated (by definition bitcoin is unregulated,no central control). No country has put in place (yet) any kind of regulation with regard to bitcoin exchanges, vendors of mining services,vendors of mining rigs,etc.

As you study the charts /exchanges please have a look at this:
On Mt.Gox exchange , check out the order book on the bid side.
(For the benefit of others reading; this is the people who are willing to BUY BTC in a certain quantity at a certain price and are posting their "offers" on the exchange).
You will regularly see relatively large size bids at about every $5 , they are almost always spaced out at exactly $5 intervals, they are significant in size and larger than most of the intermediate bids, they tend to increase in size as the price decreases, somewhere a few $10s down from the current live mid-quote you will see a big one, maybe low 100s BTC. This creates the impression that there is some underlying buying interest in the market at a price a bit below current price. Underpinning if you like. It seems quite probable to me that as this occurs so regularly now (as the price continues its downward trend) that such evenly spaced bids are probably all from the same source. Their existence also skews the market depth histogram to suggest more buy interest than sell interest at these lower prices.
This has been obvious for some time but the price keeps falling and these bids keep reappearing spaced $5 apart at the lower levels.
I suggest you watch this phenomena quite closely. I have my suspicions that this is not "real" buy interest but may be exchange manipulation. Unfortunately as Mt.Gox is unregulated (like all bitcoin exchanges !) we have no way of telling or asking a regulator to investigate. However it is possible to strip these out of the order book and have a look at what is left, this then shows a particularly thin bid side i.e. lack of buyers. This being much more consistent with the actual price movements (i.e. downwards, with a few bumps along the way). Of course if they had not have been there to "fool" many of the market participants we might well be way way lower already.
Keep an eye on them, the exact $5 spacing is quite a giveaway in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:05:32
There is definately something going on out there. I do not have any inside contacts in the financial/banking world but have been doing a fair bit of research and keep finding little bits of info, for example:

All bitcoin exchanges are unregulated. 45% of all bitcoin exchanges who have ever existed have "disappeared" taking clients $ and/or BTC with them. I have no way of telling whether Mt.Gox is 100% honest and fair and neither do you !
Therefore if you do any kind of business with them you are definately taking a risk. Time will tell if this is a large risk or not and it might be expensive for you by the time you find out the answer.

@_date: 2013-12-18 12:35:42
Bumping around $500 @ midday-ish UK time. Check out the huge skew in the order books on the exchanges !!
 I reckon there is a lot of manipulation on these unregulated exchanges and no one has a hope in hell of checking their honesty (or otherwise). We are probably overdue for one of them to "disappear/run off with the bitcoins/have an accident ("Oh dear the servers caught fire") or some such thing.
 I am now more 60/40 for the "Death of Bitcoin" by the end of THIS year but there may well be a bit of rough price stabilization first for a day or 2 which will be exchange manipulation to suck in some more fiat from the rather large numbers of "buy it low" idiots waiting to finance their dream a bit more. Scammers always like to top it off with a bit more cream if it is there for the taking !
Certainly I expect the weekend to be "very interesting" in the bitcoin world, keep an eye out for something really unexpected at this stage of the game !
For myself this weekend will be spent constructing a home made furnace for smelting down scrap ASICS boards for the gold early next year.

Hypothetical question:
If you had a metric tonne of gold would you sell it to me for 40,000 BTC ? If you take longer than 30 seconds to work out whether your answer is Yes or No then I think you need to think a "bit" more carefully about what you are doing with your BTC and/or how much $ you are "investing" in it. 
Please note I am not saying if Yes or No is the correct (or better) answer. I am saying that you should already know know what the answer is or, my friend, you are "pissing in the dark".

First rule of investing "DO NOT INVEST IN ANYTHING YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND".
Anyway bitcoin is not an "investment" it is an ILLUSION and is in a wild speculative bubble. Very soon it will collapse and all in it at the time will loose everything they have. Please be sensible. Do not put any money into this "scam", there are players in this "game" who have vastly more experience power and knowledge than you, stay well clear my friend.

Merry Christmas to all from Badger mansions.
The $ price of bitcoin is simply determined by demand (supply is fixed). Most current demand is coming from speculators and day traders. Recent extreme volatility will have burnt quite a few and they are now leaving the market and will be unlikely to return.
Sentiment has now turned. Governments are restricting fiat/bitcoin transactions. The 2014 future for bitcoin is bleak.
It will become increasingly difficult to convert existing bitcoins into other currencies and therefore the "investment" aspect is being closed off.
Far from predicting $2014 I think we will never see $1240 again and 2014 will probably see bitcoin trading at well below $100. Of course a low price does not mean the "end of bitcoin" necessarily but as so many bitcoin owners are really just in it for profit the sub $100 area leaves only those who truly support the crypto currency as an idea. Time will tell how many of those there are but I expect it to be very small compared to the current ownership distribution.

All the people interested in ShillingForBitcoin are already hard at it here and elsewhere. Some of their recent posts and comments/replies do seem to be a little "desperate" recently.
Do you think they are in panic mode ? 
Because they most certainly should be !!!!!!
I get more and more confident each day that the crash is coming sooner rather than later. Just look at the behaviour, language and the undertone of their posts.
Actually the tone and feel to things is changing quite quickly now and I am beginning to think I might actually miss the crash while I am out at my other job. Which will be a shame as this is going to be a real BIGGY !

"The Badger" tells it in black &amp; white.
Hi newbies ! As I understand it you have bought something you do not understand and committed half your monthly savings to it and you think that is being cautious.
When did you last buy something you did not understand ?
What else in the past have you committed a large % of you monthly savings too ?
Did you get professional advice ?
One of the general rules about investing is DO NOT INVEST IN ANYTHING YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. 
People who do so are of course a scammers delight.
And anyway Bitcoin is not an investment is it a speculation currently in a wild and unsustainable frenzy. Maybe you bitcoins are already showing a profit ? My advice would be to sell them , take the profit, treat yourself to something nice for yourself and your wife and consider yourself lucky. Please, please stay clear of things you do not understand - it usually ends in misery or worse.
General advice to all readers of my comments:
Print all my coments out, keep them,read them over and over again. THINK ! Good luck to you - I hope you make the right decision.

Bitcoin would be a lot better if it was not used for drugs, hookers, illegal gambling or tax evasion. In fact if it was entirely 100% legal use only.
Mind you the whole world would be better if we could actually get rid of all the criminals and drug users who are only making life more expensive and unpleasant for the rest of us. Ideally I would ship them all "TO THE MOON !" !!
In addition I would probably add quite a few of the participants on here who seem unable to conduct a sensible adult conversation without swearing, general rudeness, racism , trolling and the like. In short all those who behave like kids in the schoolroom.

One of the factors in play here is that, unlike internet discussions forums on other ideas, the bitcoin idea actually has a lot of participants who have invested a significant (for them) amount of real money.
These "investors" have a VERY high interest in seeing the bitcoin thing progress and the price incease quickly like it has done in the past. It is mainly the rapid price increase and potential "promise" of increased personal wealth that has spurred their investment.
True, there are many here who believe in the idea of cryptocurrencies in general and/or bitcoin in particular irrespective of the BTC/$ price (and its increase). However since November 2013 with the rapid price spike to $1240 a large number have "invested" to some extent.
Unfortunately for them much of this was  at/near the top of the market and there is now a considerable degree of disquiet/worry in their minds now they see a real world loss (if they cash out). Hence the motivation to hype the price up to above their purchase price to "feel safe".
You can read between the lines of most of the shill posters on here, it really is them just acting in their own self interest in view of the money they have spent on bitcoins. As the price continues to fall (as I and darkwings predict) you will see these posters screaming even louder. The continued down voting to myself and darkwings is really just a part of this.
In reality, on an open forum like this there is little that can be done to counter such behaviour, however I shall continue to post and reply on here, as I am sure darkwings will, irrespective of the down votes. I have other ID here anyway ! As long as it (bitcoin) is in existence we can usefully still point out to some potential "investors" of the danger of losing their money in this scheme. This is my MAIN purpose in being here but I am happy to occassionally debate with bitcoiners or others about specific matters.
Perhaps if you out there were to debate in a bit more of an adult / polite manner it might preferable for other readers.   
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:17:37
I have plenty to back it up, just look at the price of bitcoin/$ now and how it has behaved in the last few weeks. Compare this to historical records of previous scams/ponzis/etc. Please do some more research yourself !
BTW I didn't ever say I did not "like" bitcoin, what I did say was that if you invest money in it hoping to make it rich you stand a very high probability of losing everything. The time I spend here is minimal actually in relation to my other hobbies &amp; activities and I am quite happy with it but thanks for your concern (?!?).
Also I am not "being negative"  but simply telling you all how I see it. i.e. It is a scam, you will lose money, please get out of it, etc. And I don't need to be paid for my time anymore as I am retired so effectively the government pays me my pension for doing nothing or whatever I want. Isn't that nice of them !
So thanks to the pension, my lovely free time, my 50+ years of investing you will continue to get my informative "anti - scam" post here (until it reaches $0 &amp; then I might do something else).

Thanks for the flattery, actually this is not the first time someone has suggested that I am he ! I came into this forum about 2 weeks ago and was very surprised how one sided it was considering the immediately obvious (to me anyway) similarity between bitcoins price/$ trading chart and things like tulip mania. I would have thought there would be at least a few % of people on here making this kind of comment. However it appear that darkwings-08 was the only one. I PMed him to ask if there were any other like us and he did not know of any. Quite amazing really. I know these sub reddits are really enthusiasts sites but the pro-bitcoin/anti "bubble/scam/ponzi" bias is truly amazing.
As we live in a free country / democracy I find it strange that so many of you appear to be anti free speech (i.e. what I or darkwings have to say). Maybe some strong disagreement or arguments were expected but the level of intelligent debate is very poor and a significant percentage of you seem to think "Suck dick faggot" is the appropriate kind of response to my views.
I am unfortunately forced to conclude that a significant majority of pro-bitcoiners here are :
1)Unintelligent morons.
2)Unable to conduct any kind of argument without foul language.
3)Not a credit to their country or democracy in general.
I therefore conclude that whatever the merits of cryptocurrency in general (and there may well be many) the fact that Bitcoin  has attracted such a sorry crowd of druggies/criminals/foul mouthed morons and dishonest persons in general really signs the death knell for this particular currency.
So now I am modifying my advice, if you fall into one or more of the categories I have mentioned please continue to BUY,BUY,BUY bitcoins with every last $ you have.
If you are in the minority as an honest law abiding Joe then please heed my earlier advice and SELL NOW !.
Trust that keeps you all happy now.

Thanks to GravityChanges for the first intelligent and well thought out response I have had for a long time. Well done my friend you are clearly a thinker. It should be one of your first thoughst if you are buying/selling anything to think very carefully about people who post comments particularly in favour of doing one or the other. It is quite possible that a pro-seller is trying to rig the market, cause a dip and buy. But if you think like that you must surely also realise that the converse applies. And pro-buyers may be trying to rig the market for a rise so they can make more profit. Consider carefully both points when reading posts and replies on here.
As to myself I have never owned any bitcoins and have no interest in doing so. I do have an interest in seeing people don't make stupid mistakes with their real world finances. I get nothing out of this (apart from a nice warm feeling (Kudos?) if I have helped someone have a better life.
Good luck to all of you out there- I hope you make the right decision.

I generally only ask "complete strangers" for directions to e.g. the nearest bitcoin exchange when I am lost. Questioning (asking) presupposes a degree of familiarity.
However reddits are a forum so to a large extent we are all strangers to one another and we post comments and replies to redditors in order that there is an exchange of views, opinions,fact,etc. If you were to take this seriously instead of posting puerile comments like "..3 hot wives" then maybe you and others might actually get something useful out of this forum.

"The Badger" tells it in black and white.
Yes it is VERY important to have freedom of speech and information exchange.(See my previous replies on this site).
An important source of information is published literature particularly of a factual and historical nature.
Please have a look at "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" by Charles Mackay.
I continue to freely state that my predication is for Bitcoin to crash by 26th December 2014. Please get out now if you can and spend your real $ on something nice for you and your loved ones. Once Bitcoin crashes you will have completely lost all the money you put into it. It will be WORTHLESS.
Free speech replies to my comments are VERY welcome as always.
