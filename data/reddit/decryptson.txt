Thanks for your response �� 
Did you get the same notice with the 'Buy Cancelled' ?
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:34:49
Indeed. I still have an unconfirmed tx from 2 days ago -_-

Thank you, yeah that's what I ended up having to do. I waiting 50 hours and then took it the next step when it still went unconfirmed.. I thought I'd wait a little while longer to see if by some chance it would be picked up. Rescanned the blockchain had the transaction flushed out and resent it. Then it came up as a double spend and eventually a few hours later, all the btc was sorted out in the right places.

I sent it from an HD wallet.. the Exodus wallet. I'm not too sure how to get the private key from there and try and double spend it
@_date: 2016-11-26 20:00:48
Yeah I had to solve it with a double spend  -__-  it just wasn't being picked up, I was using an HD wallet, and it hadn't been upgraded to its latest update (exodus wallet)
The fee was set at .0003  I didn't think anything of it, just had some btc in that wallet and sent it, lesson learned, Always check the fee! Haha.

Same. About 10 hours myself. 226 byte 74 satoshi/byte 
@_date: 2016-12-12 22:44:53
That's the odd thing, I had no contact made whatsoever..
@_date: 2016-12-10 15:59:08
Do you think that tx will be confirmed within the next couple of hours though?
@_date: 2016-12-22 20:42:12
I'll give you 550 a pop if you are serious

Circle used to be the spot, but they decided to not sell Bitcoin anymore a few months back. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 13:16:29
Yeah I caught that too.. No good OP
@_date: 2016-07-09 14:37:19
lol that was funny
@_date: 2017-07-11 12:07:17
Honestly, 3% isn't disastrous at all compared to like said, ATMs, and some vendors and exchanges could have quite high fees as well. 3 percent isn't great but it really isn't shabby.

Well said honestly. I knew I was a pointless thread in the first place, then decided to post it anyway  lol.

It is holding pretty nicely. I personally thought it would have dropped a bit more then it did. Sideways movements a good sign

Slow and steady wins the race
