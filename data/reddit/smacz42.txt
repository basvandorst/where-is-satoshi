To that point then, just as the mining algorithm fluctuates based off of the mining power that is put into it, could perhaps the transaction size per block fluctuate to reflect the number of transactions placed?
That presumably would have the affect of regulating the transaction fees. Of course, what would the nominal fee size be, and who would decide what amount the block size would try to steer it towards?
In effect, it would act as a tax - standardized and implemented on all transactions. But the tax would then go to the miners and profit the system more than the goverment tax profits the people that pay it. 
Despite those moral questions, technically, couldn't the block size implement a self-correcting mechanism efficiently to maintain the spirit of an open and competative market?

To continue with the photo analogy, what if the picture itself was tied to some value on the blockchain in someway relating to the tx? I can't say that i've thought this through on a technical platform, but would it be feasible to create a DRM-like infastructure that worked correctly using the blockchain? 
BTW, I'm looking at the situation from a starving artist's perspective.

As far as PGP passwords go, the first step here is to fight *dragnet* surveillance. PGP does that. Targed surveillance, the one that requires warrents and targed criminals, should be encouraged, as it really does keep us safe. Also, it requires a better warrent than a FISA court can give.
In essence, it will dissuade agencies from going after everyones data (too expensive and time-consuming) and just go after the ones that they really want. 
Like I said, however, this is just the first step in the war against surveillance.

While that is a true point, I think that can only come after several initial steps to recover the infastructure of the web. 
However, that's not what I came to comment about. I am looking to get an external hdd or ssd to store my backups. What manufacturers have given us reason to believe that they would (most likely) not be backdoored. Or at least who should I avoid like the plague?

Many localbitcoin transactions are done via bank wires and the sort. Keep in mind that these guys are dealing with very very large sums of money...and over $10,000 require additional forms and paperwork. In order to make any kind of bitcoin adoption feasible (other than direct payment...see below) then they would have to distribute the funds for individuals to use via their own accounts or to wire independently, either way, it would be difficult to convert all of that cash into BTC.
On the other side of the fence, BTC would be the perfect payment method, for total legalized states, not medicinal as I'm sure the powers that be have a vested interest in maintaining records of all purchasers -- at least medicinally. Storage and banking problems for these entrepreneurs would be solved if they could accept bitcoin for transactions. 
I will admit that while it is little more than a coincidence that these two events (BTC and legalization of cannabis) are happening right now, it is a great opportunity to create a giant leap forward not only for the economy and this country, but for the world in general. We need to make sure that we do this right. Any suggestions?

I know that the block chain scripting language is Turing-incomplete, but would there be a way to scale block size in relation to the number of transactions -- like how hashing difficulty scales in relation to mining power?
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:31:34
I feel like the centralization of mining is of more concern than the node size. And in fact, that's what the decentralization there is referring to: Bitcoin's value based on the *decentralized* consensus among the miners.
Now if the miners ever centralize...well, let's just say

To which banking system are you referring to?
If the transfer is through credit card, the recipient is paying the credit card company somewhere around 4% of that "transfer". If they weren't paying that not only for your transaction, but for *every* transaction with everyone else they transacted with, the savings could potentially lead them to adjust their prices accordingly. Looking at the situation from a separate perspective anyways.

This is a question that I had been grappling with for awhile as well. Bank accounts in the US are out. Credit Cards/Paypal/Gift Cards as well. 
If you really know them, I guess cash is the way to go. Money wires are sketchy but the best so far over long distances?
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:29:36
I actually struggled with this for awhile. I *just* (as in haven't tried it yet) heard of [purse.io]( which lets you (in a round-about way) purchase bitcoin.
1. Use cash to purchase Amazon gift card from local grocery store
2. Sign up for purse.io
3. ???
4. Move bitcoins from purse.io wallet to personal wallet.
As you can see, I'm a little hazy on the details, but it seems to work...most of the time anyways. Some people here aren't big fans, but if reddit can't bring it down...
~~Also I have tried [GiftCardDrainer]( which worked just fine, but it takes somewhere around 20% of the value for the fee.~~ Out of business.
There seem to be more giftcard for bitcoin sites out there since the last time I checked. Just be cautious and prudent.
