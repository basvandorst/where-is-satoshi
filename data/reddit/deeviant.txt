Which was not the scenario I presented, and if you could not understand the scenario I presented, I can't be sure you understand any thing said here. As your example was trivial and not at all talking to the point I made, which is that diversification does not equal "Free money!", but is about risk management.

Your example addresses exactly none of the points I raised today.
The assumption that each index has the same return is silly, one who is presumably *under*diversifies is doing some because they believe they have identified over-performing companies/investments.

No, that is not true at all. It has nothing to do with "money", it has to do with **risk**.
If you did an investor club with many people investing fake money to see who would "win", it will **always** but the un-diversified investor who got lucky enough to go "all-in" on a stock that went big that wins.
No amount of slippery language can get you past the facts: diversification is about risk management, not about "free-money, yo!". If you one had, for the sake of argument, absolute know that a stock would outperform all others, diversification in such case would be stupid, diversification is needed because very few people have such absolute knowledge.
I'm not saying diversification is bad, just that you are representing in correctly.

Risk only has an arbitrary correlation with value, one that is defined by the person or interest that is under taking said risk.
The level of acceptable risk is different for different perspectives and positions. 
To say portfolio A contains less risk and therefore it is more valuable than portfolio B that has double the annual return but carries 50% more risk, is patently false. This is the point I was make. I am **not** making the point that diversification is bad, it's not, it's just that it is also not the thing that you are characterizing it as.
In the words of somebody that knows what they are talking about: "wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing".

US treasuries would be idiotic for the vast majority of investors to put all(really, any) of their money in since they have a shit return, they might as well keep it under their mattress. 
I had a very strong notion that bitcoins were going to go big, a year ago. So I put all available money I had to invest in, which was unfortunately relatively small.  I sold when they hit 1000. It obviously worked out pretty well for me.
But yeah, maybe I should have stuck it in some well diversified mutual fund or perhaps a vanguard index fund, so they I could have gotten the clearly superior ~13%, rather then the ~2500% I received. You know, because risk is bad.

It's like a college student that has had 2 finance classes and thinks he is Warren Buffet.

You apparently can only listen to yourself talk. 
You should do that rather than trying to talk to yourself via a conversation with somebody else.

And the scenario you are presenting is the opposite of the one I was stating. I already said diversification is fine, it is simply not the truth that any diversified portfolio&gt; any non-diversified portfolio, as was suggested. 
This is the only statement I was speaking to, and when I pointed it out, the response was about everything **but** the aforementioned statement.

You're too stupid or too ignorant to speak further with.
But for posterity and summary sake:
This is what you said:


My response:


I also explicitly said that diversification is not a bad thing, I simply did not agreed with your characterization of it.
You response:

Once again, your example fails to say anything regarding what I said.
You have to have some sort of mental block, even by using your math, you should quickly realize that there **is** an inflection point after which the volatile index would start to outperform.
So the only thing you have managed to day is that a volatile stock needs to return more than a non-volatile index, no really?

No, it's not like "throwing money away", it's more like playing poker with your retirement money.
