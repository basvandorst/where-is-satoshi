Guys, this is cryptocurrencies - THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS COLLUSION.
Every single cryptocurrency is essentially "collusion" - constantly claiming that they have the best coin, everyone should "HODL", don't panic, buy dips, NEVER SELL.
It's a giant fucking scheme to increase demand, decrease risk, and increase $$$.  It's not rocket science.
We've entered big boy territory and now bigger companies and bigger players will join the game.  Expect news, corporations, and billionaires to game the system.
This is what cryptocurrency is all about.  Play the game or get off.

Each lost wallet is "destroyed" bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:22
Are you being facetious?  Definition: 


The vast majority of people here have bought Bitcoin with hopes that it increases in value.  Even on this sub the entire conversation revolves around bitcoin as an investment vehicle.  It's constant talks about price, conversations about hold vs. sell, futures, % returns, limits, etc.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:28
Welcome to cryptocurrencies?  We're in the wild west, play the game or get out of the game.  
It's not rocket science.
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:49:58
I don't understand.  No one knows what the price will be tomorrow, next week, or next year.  People selling are liquidating some funds.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:26
Sure, but how does one know when to sell high or buy low when no one knows what the high or low is?
Anyone who claims to know the ceiling or floor is feeding you shit.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:16
Yes, it's crashing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:17
Hate to break it to you but the vast majority of bitcoin owners are simply investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:03
He means that its in his best interest if everyone just buys and "HODLS".  Anyone who doesn't do this is just stupid and doesn't understand Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:20:02
I don't disagree.  But these two statements are not equal:




@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:22
You say that as if you know when the crash is occurring.  At the current rates one can make more in a bitcoin buy / sell in a day than they can make in a year in the stock market.
Buying now for long term is stupid IMO, but not so bad for short term (although risky).
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:03:13
* - There's a massive dip coming!
* Me - Nice, so we should sell some and buy at the dip price to maximize holdings
* - NO, HODL ALWAYS
* Me - ... umm
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:06
There's nothing fud about cashing out.  Stop getting so personal, we know that it's in your best interest if everyone just buys and never sells.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:36
Yea, I didn't explain it well.  He is speaking out of his ass - it's like if I own a pizza restaurant and you tell me the pizza sucks and I say "Well clearly you don't _understand_ real pizza". 
It has nothing to do with competence of the technology, it's just a defense mechanism to doing something that he disagrees with.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:56:32
And that's part of the game.  Either diversify funds to reduce risk or ride one train for the highest risk vs. reward.
No one knows what tomorrow or next week will bring.  Lots of individuals are attempting to manipulate the market at a small scale by spamming propoganda on sites like this.  Now we've got bigger companies, governments, billionaires also manipulating the market.  
This is all expected and it's all part of the game.  It's an unregulated market, it's what we all wanted... right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:04


... 


@_date: 2017-12-06 14:07:19
The lesson in this is not to listen to any advice and to be comfortable with your own decisions.
No one knows what will happen, no one.  Once you accept this you accept that any decision you make is 100% your own.  It could be right, it could be wrong, but you have to look at the risk vs. reward for your financial situation and make it.
It's like asking someone what the next # in roulette is and blaming them for being wrong.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:00:05
It's like a baseball card worth $15,000.  You simply sell it using various exchanges.  The current going rate is $15,000, so someone will buy it from you.
It may be worth $10,000 tomorrow or $20,000.  No one knows.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:40:03
Come on, really?  I see people all the time (even on this subreddit) that actually believe BTC will increase to 40k, 100k, etc. and don't realize it could crash at any moment. 
Individuals who know nothing about investing are seeing the hype, putting in more money than they can afford to lose, and riding the train.  People are putting in their entire paychecks and getting applauded.  
Edit: Oh yea, and those who are taking loans out to buy BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:05:27
Please don't give advice to people on $$ if you aren't qualified.  There is no statistical proof that "now" is the right time to buy.  No one knows whether it will go up or down or what it will be at tomorrow, 1 year, or 10 years from now.
You sound like someone in Vegas claiming to know how to beat roulette.  Like there's been 5 blacks in a row so definitely need to red.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:56


LMAO - so now you're saying every one of the front page posts with hundreds of people panicking are all trolls with interests elsewhere?  
Come on man.  This sub is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:11:52


Even this is bad advice, stop spreading this shit.  *Bitcoin is not invincible*.  Period.  Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be higher than it is today in 1 year, 5 years, or 100 years.  Bitcoin can crash, Bitcoin can get replaced.  Is it likely?  Not in my opinion but claiming that it's simply not possible is ignorant.
My real advice would be to invest what you're willing to lose and diversify your funds to a risk that's acceptable to your financial situation.  
Edit: Fuck, your post has 26 upvotes - that's insane.  I'm thinking (hoping) that this is mostly people who realize that the more people believe its true the higher BTC goes, but part of me realizes there are people who actually believe this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:03:12


@_date: 2017-12-06 15:08:36
Not sure why you're getting downvoted.  It's moving so fast because of the hype cycle.  The higher it goes, the more people talk about it, and the more people want to buy.  Since there's limited supply, the more people wanting to buy pushes up the price.  They feed off eachother and are causing the price to skyrocket.
I don't think it will "correct" itself in the morning but no one actually knows.  Financial experts, Bitcoin Gurus, no one knows what the price will be tomorrow or next week.  
Some reasons that a "correction" or a crash would occur would be bad news about Bitcoin such as a major hack or competitive cryptocoin success.  A crash could occur if the opposite of the hype cycle occurred - many people start selling which decreases the price, which causes people to panic, and mass sell.  This has occurred several times with non-crypto financial assets. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:56
That's it bud, every post on the front page panicking about collusion and Bitcoin Cash are just shills.
Jesus Christ, this sub reminds me of @_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:43
People keep saying this like it's good advice but it's not.  No one knows what Bitcoin will do - no one.  It seems even you, a very Bitcoin optimist believes there will be a dip, "buy the dip".
So from an investment point of view, it does make sense to sell some before a dip, depending on your confidence. 
If BTC drops to 1/2 price tomorrow and I sold today, I could DOUBLE my Bitcoins in a day.  It's about balancing your risk vs. reward and someone who is risk averse may choose to sell and buy on the high and lows to optimize wealth. 
As to why people on Ars hate Bitcoin?  I'd imagine many of them were aware of Bitcoin early on and had an opportunity to buy it and be rich now but didn't.  Now it's kind of a coping mechanism to shit on Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:44:54
While you may be right, it's also possible that one of the alts becomes the standard and Bitcoin dies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:28
Nearly every post needs "IMO" at the end.  The one above it is saying that it will be a wild ride (aka, massive dips) yet says "HODL".   WTF? 
From an investment point of view, if one believes a dip is going to occur they should sell some of their investmenet and re-buy at a lower price.  
There is so much stupid advice on this thread that it hurts my head.  No one knows what Bitcoin will do.  Anyone who claims to know anything about future price is full of shit.  I *think* it will dip (maybe crash) in the next month but I'm well aware it could triple instead.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:55:27
No you wouldn't.  You would have sold when that 0.6 was worth double or triple or quadruple.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:02:36
I have $1,800 in BTC and $300 in BCH (didn't even realize I had BCH until yesterday).
I know it's cool to say everyone who isn't super pro bitcoin is a shill but it's ignorant.  It reminds me of I'm really not picking sides - I honestly don't know the technical differences or care.  I'm here for fun.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:57:36
Coinbase enabled trading of BCH.  BTC users are mad because it actually devalues BTC some by having compeition on a huge site such as Coinbase.
BTC users are also mad because Coinbase didn't announce the exact date it'd be going live.  They _did_ send an email that said "_by_ January 1st" which apparently many people read as "_on_ January 1st".
There's also the liklihood that Coinbase used their power to their advantage.  They knew that BCH support would both spike BCH price and lessen BTC price.  People are guessing that they both sold BTC and bought BCH prior to release to gain an advantage.
None of this is new or even crazy in crypto.  It's a giant game of risk vs. reward and collusion.  Even this sub is a giant advertisement whether you realize it or not.
HODL, buy dips, no panic, shitting on every other crypto, etc. etc. is propaganda to make BTC seem more valuable than it is.  If everyone HODLs, no one panics, and the hype increases, early investors get rich.
Now we've got big players in the crypto world.  Billionaires, corporations, banks, nations.  Expect the unexpected.  Play the game.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:31
He may be right.  He may be wrong.  DUN DUN DUNNN
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:31
lol, I know right?
* Guys, I have $100 allowance and want to buy bitcoin, is now a good time to buy?
* I bought 10 BTC years ago and now it's worth more money than I know what to do with.  Should I HODL? 
* I lost my wallet key, what should I do?
* BTC WILL ONLY GO UP FOREVER, HODL, DO NOT SELL, IT'S TOO BIG TO FAIL
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:50:31
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?  This looks like normal growth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:43:20
I have a small amount of BTC (nothing that would kill me to lose) and this recent surge has been fascinating.
What kind of chaos will ensue if it drops to 8k or 5k or worse?  It's like a soap opera.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:53:42
Pretend it doesn't exist and check back 365 days from now.  Seriously. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:13:28
So umm.. what's your net worth to be playing around with $10s of thousands of dollars?  
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:00:41
Sure, I'd recommend any technically savvy investor to do that.  But BTC isn't and hasn't been an elite or exclusive currency for quite some time.  There are computer illiterate newcomers looking to buy in as an investment and telling them to manage their own private key on their malware infested machines is lunacy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:51:18
The only thing inevitable about Bitcoin is that its price will change.  No one knows whether it will go up or down.  Enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:32:59
To be honest, you should be diversifying your assets across different coins and most definitely outside of crypto entirely.  
Investing is all about risk vs. reward.  You must balance your portfolio to a risk level that you're comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:42
Sure, it's possible.  It's also possible for your wallet and keys to get stolen off of your computer.  It comes down to whether it's more or less likely to get coins stolen by protecting it locally or remote.
I'd guess most newcomers are better off not doing the DIY route.  Just look at all the posts of noobs who lost their keys or access to their wallet.  
And my FUD point was that just because it's possible doesn't mean you should advise against it.  It's possible that BTC crashes so don't invest?  (also FUD).
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:23
Isn't this FUD?  What's wrong with coinbase?  
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:49:28
lmao (unless you're actually suicidal).  C'est la vie.  Obviously if you could have predicted the future you'd be rich - hell, I'd go back and hoarde a few thousand... or maybe pick up some winning lottery tickets, bet on some sports games, invest in AMZN, etc. 
The thing about Bitcoin is that there is no logic.  Anyone that says they know what will happen to the price is completely full of shit.  As of today, you came out ahead.  If Bitcoin crashes (non-zero chance), millions of people will be in the red and wishing they were in your shoes. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:16:00
Not to be harsh, but don't be a dumbass.  You're holding onto $200,000 and asking random internet Redditors what to do?  Please mother of god tell me you're joking.
You're holding onto a highly risky and volatile fund.  If $200,000 is a lot of moeny to you then you need to reduce that risk by taking some portion of it, selling it, and investing it in a less risky market.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:58:30
Nothing.  It's a virtual crypto currency whose value is reflected almost entirely by speculation and investors trying to make some moolah.
Seriously.  Don't pretend otherwise, invest what you're willing to lose and jump in.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:44:46
If $10,000 is a lot of money to you I would of recommended you taking a portion of it and investing in a safer fund.  In my life, $10,000 isn't that much money so I probably would have said let it ride.  $200,000+ is life changing money to many people, so at this point I think it's wise to hedge.
But hey, I'm just an anonymous redditor.  You really should be talking to a financial professional who you trust IRL.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:34:28
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:12
Edit: Actually I think it may be down... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:00
I bought some at $89.... and of course sold the remaining at $1,000
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:44:19
Dude, no one knows.  Period.  Invest an amount you can lose, pretend it doesn't exist, and check back in a year.
