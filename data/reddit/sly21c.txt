I hear you, but I'd have to disagree with you regarding innovation :). 
The problem with banks and their system is that they use a system called a fractional reserve lending system. What they do is they use people's deposits, create money from nothing to lend to other people, and they get to profit from this while we as depositors don't benefit much. This steals money from people through inflation.
Here's a typical scenario. You deposit $10,000,000 to BoA. Let's assume the fraction that banks are required to have in reserve is 10%. The bank then reserves $1,000,000, and lends out $9,000,000 to a businessmen for instance.
The businessmen takes the money, deposits it to his own bank, Chase Bank for instance. The bank now has $9,000,000 in deposit. It reserves 10%, i.e. $900,000 and lends out the 90% which is $8,100,000.
Now, the new money the bank created out of nothing is the balance you'll see when you go to BoA to check your account. You'll see $10,000,000, even though the bank doesn't have the $9,000,000 anymore because it lent it out. The $10,000,000 balance you will see consists of the $1,000,000 it reserved, and the new money it created that they call "Bank Credit". So in other words, there is now $19,000,000 in existence ($10,000,000 + $9,000,000). This the first stage.
The second stage is Chase Bank reserving $900,000 and lending out $8,100,000. The businessman will see $9,000,000 when he checks his balance. Meaning $8,100,000 is created from nothing, and is new money from nothing that the bank magically created. So money in existence is $27,100,000 ($10,000,000 + $9,000,000 + $8,100,000).
The above process goes on and on resulting in the banks creating $90,000,000 over and above the $10,000,000 deposit. This does two things, it benefits banks because they collect interest from the new money they created, and they create money money into circulation which results in inflation and therefore your dollars will buy less and less each year, not because things are becoming more expensive, but because your money is becoming worthless and losing its value.
So banks are not benefiting people much, they benefit themselves.

I'm no dev or tech guy at all, so my views are based purely on instinct. I think it is possible for an entity to write code and make it look as if it's one guy. So you think Satoshi is one person? If it is one guy, I believe Satoshi Nakamoto is not his/her real name.

My hope is that in future we don't get convinced by a clever group of people, who's sole role is to control and monopolize, that they be trusted with being a central authority, somehow, so we can have a cryptocurrency that can transact for commerce. This may happen because we desperately want out of the centralized nature of fiat currency, but might fall into a trap set by those group of men. There are always people that want to control. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:12:12
I feel your pain, and I can relate, although you're in a worse situation than me. I worked for 10 years and I saved a lot of money. Like you I didn't travel much, as in I've never been out of my country. I'm in my early 30s, no kids and mostly single because starting a family is expensive. The idea is to be financially free before I get married and have kids.
The answer came when I got introduced to crypto and how money can be made in May 2017. I had saved up about $50k. I invested a little while learning as much as possible. Then in August, I invested 90% of my crypto funds into Binance. My investment went up 4x making me a millionaire in my country, South Africa. I was worth about 200k in US dollar terms, which is a lot in my country.
I then made a series of bad investments after China banned ICOs and there was FUD everywhere. Those investments resulted in me going from having about 200k to about 10k. That's how bad things got. I'm still trying to recover my initial investment and then get back to over 200k, and more.
I hope things work out for you. Remember, don't regret so much that it prevents you from seeing future opportunities.

This is why we desperately need decentralized exchanges to take off. A centralized exchange is like a traditional bank, while a decentralized exchange is like MEW. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:42:37
But why do we have to listen to governments? Governments represent people, meaning governments must listen to its citizens and not the other way around. I think we as the early adopters can trade amongst ourselves using cryptocurrencies as our medium of exchange or currency, regardless whether governments recognize cryptocurrenies as legal tender or not.
Can you please list other functions that banks perform other than routing people's money, that cryptocurrencies and blockchain based companies can't replicate in a decentralized manner? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:53
F¢¥k the US government, they're nothing but a bunch of slave owners. They want a population of financial illiterate citizens, so those citizens depend on their government.

Man, crypto needs a decentralized exchange badly. Including an exchange that's a fiat gateway somehow. Protests and petitions to central authorities shouldn't be in the crypto.

South Africa. A low middle class area in my country refers to middle income areas in townships/rural areas. So the lowest priced, small 2 bedroom house in those areas is around $20k/$25k.

I used to defend Roger Ver when everyone was attacking him, then it all changed when he hit Andreas below the belt when he said he's not a millionaire. This thread is further proof for me that Roger is an absolute ahole. If someone got free Bitcoin, what's the issue? This is crypto and funds will never be reversed. And for Roger Ver to look up someone's info is scammy. Blockchain.info shouldn't exist if it has the capacity to track people's information and identity.

A value of a house must be approved by a bank? Does this apply to paid off property? Seems like you don't have an issue with the real estate regulations, and that banks approve property values? I think things must change, and as a community around the world we can reach consensus regarding property prices and transfer processes using Math and protocols.

Yep, smoking, drinking, buying worthless diamonds, buying brand name clothes, etc, are nothing but a transfer of wealth to the rich. We should make ourselves rich or financially stable instead by buying Bitcoin, or alt coins.

The Dutch newspaper sounds like people who still think that taxation is not legalized theft. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:25:25
That's the idea yes. I'd rather have armchair wannabe traders than workers who keep getting eff'd over by bankers who continuously devalue their savings through inflation, which is brought on by the fractional reserve lending system which is fraud actually but has been legalized. This fractional reserve system is the reason why the poor and the middle class get poorer and the rich get richer. You sound like you're a great spokesperson for uncle Sam? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:21:59
Coins can be started that lends people money to buy houses. These may not be referred to as mortgages, it might be something completely different. But cryptocurrenies can definitely perform that function.
Banks are not the only entity that can perform that function. Same applies for business loans, and personal loans.

If retailers are targeted by governments then small scale mom and pap stores will be used, and will be difficult to police. There's always a way around government control, and once enough people can make their lives to totally operate without using government controlled fiat currencies, then governments will lose their power and control.

Maybe you need teach me how a deflationary currency can be devastating to an economy. I don't claim to know anything, but I don't see how deflation can be bad for an economy so much so that we can't at all adopt it. Is there a country that used a deflationary currency and didn't function as as economy? 
The implications of an inflationary currency is devastating also because central banks have no limit to the amount of money they can create. This leads to higher taxes since interest rates have to be paid over and above the principle money that was printed to lend to governments.
Inflation can lead to hyperinflation, which is devastating.
If any cryptocurrency coin can be made to perform a function that banks can, and can truly be used in real life, then there's nothing wrong with this. Creating a cryptocurrency just for the sake of creating a currency with no chance of impacting real life scenarios is obviously not going to work. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:17:25
Agreed, but decentralized cryptocurrenies or ICOs can lend people money. Coins such as SALT (I think, I stand to be corrected) was made to lend money to people. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:27:59
Very ingenious, and it's funny that it still occurs till this day.
The thing is that if banks can create money from nothing, loan it to a businessman to create jobs, then why can't we as normal citizens create our own money from nothing like the banks do? Why is this privilege only reserved for banks? I think it's because we've been conditioned from a young age that money only comes from banks and goes back to banks.
We need to change that mentality, we need to come up with a protocol (like the blockchain is a protocol for money transfers) that anyone can use to lend money to someone else, whether family or someone we don't know. I think this is possible to do. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:48:44
Definitely not worth it. Cramer is all about hype and making money, while Andreas has a higher IQ, and is inspirational.

I would only panic sell alt coins, Bitcoin is digital gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:38:29
People have their digital bank accounts hacked almost daily, and sometimes banks reimburse victims and sometimes not.
I think people can be persuaded and taught to be more careful and manage their money, and also take responsibility in case they lose everything. People can be taught from primary school level onwards. Our current school system doesn't teach us enough about money, I think that's one area that can change.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:15:03
I want it for retail transactions, but not now. If we are to have mass adoption, we need it for quick daily transactions to replace fiat currencies and banks. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:12:02
Coinbase is centralized, definitely not a solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:28:15
Yep it is. I also think blockchain technology is the answer to central banking, and their scammy, monopolistic and predatory practices.

This is not going to end well. Bitcoin is no longer a currency but it's now a speculative asset only. This is definitely not what this first of its kind decentralized digital currency was meant to be.

Hopefully a solution will be found that doesn't require a trusted authority such as the legal fraternity. Math, transparency and decentralization will be the possible solution to this.

Condolences to you and your family. I can't imagine how he must have felt. Losing 6000 or 15000 BTCs, whether through a hack or through selling them early, is a situation no one wants to be in.
Thanks for posting this story, it really hit home. 
I started investing into Bitcoin and other alt coins in May 2017. I started off with 8 Bitcoins. I invested into Binance, using almost all my funds, which took me to a peak of 25 Bitcoins. Then the China FUD happened, and my Bitcoin wealth declined back to about 8 Bitcoins. I then wanted to get back to 25 Bitcoins or more by investing into riskier alt coins. No risk no reward was my mentality. I made a series of emotional trades, investments and gambles which has resulted in me having 1 Bitcoin now. So I lost 7 Bitcoins.
Reading your story, mine is nothing and I should be okay. Had I lost 800 Bitcoins, I wouldn't be alive today.
I'm withdrawn from my family, and my sister has complained recently. I quit my part time studies because I'm consumed by the possibility of riches in cryptocurrenies. Luckily I still have my job.
Take care out there guys. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:30:16
Nope, definitely not Utopia, crypto will never be Utopia or offer a Utopian society. The idea is for decisions to be made in a trustless, open and decentralized manner. This, hopefully, will be better than the current "democratic" system that a lot of countries enjoy. The Soviet Union was a clear centralized society, no connection to a decentralized society. A democratic society is more open, and in a way, decentralized than a communist society. The crypto society that I am hoping will arise will be more decentralized and democratic than the current democratic model.

My point is no system or cryptocurrency wallet should have a function that allows anyone to connect the said wallet to any individual, unless the individual used a centralized exchange that requested KYC. Because in that case you can trace the transactions back to a hardware wallet, etc. If blockchain.info has that weakness, then it's no different to a traditional bank account. This means people can be banned from using cryptocurrencies, and arrested because they can be caught.

Centralized exchanges should be extinct, the same way banks should be extinct. Decentralized exchanges are congruent to cryptocurrenies, while centralized exchanges are taking us back. We're all dependent on governments with centralized exchanges, but we are immune from interference and slave legislation from government through decentralized exchanges. Etherdelta is an excellent exchange, and I love using it. There are no deposit and withdrawal delays at all.

We don't need WSJ endorsing Bitcoin, they're only endorsing it because the Bitcoin community made it work. They made it work because they already know the true value of Bitcoin, and its underlying technology.

I've decided I'm also going almost all in. I'm planning to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using 65% of my total networth. I've so far used 10% of my total networth to buy bitcoins and other alternative cryptocurrency coins. Diversification is for the 99% of the world population, I want to be as close as possible to the wealthiest 1%. I'm just waiting for my wallet holder exchange to allow me to deposit more money than they currently allow me. Screw playing it safe. I'm aware of the risks. 
Most of the world's self made billionaires made their fortunes from one company and then diversity later. Diversification is for people who will read about rich people until they retire will little wealth.
