Playing devils advocate and trying to put myself in the shoes of the 'European officials' as the article says: I suppose those people are of the fairly strong conviction that drug use is bad in general and they want to cut it out. They see DNMs as enabling more people to get their hands on drugs I suppose.
The fact it's a safer environment (in comparison with getting drugs through traditional means) really doesn't matter much to them I imagine.
You say "How is this not just evil? Basically saying they want more people to get hurt?" I honestly don't think they want more people to get hurt and they don't see it as that.

Are there any estimates of how many of the 21 million bitcoins have already been mined but lost forever? Through private key loss? I would imagine that many of the earlier coins mined could have been lost this way.

Could this mean a SEPA transaction would be faster than the time it takes a bitcoin transaction to confirm?
Not trolling, genuine question.
@_date: 2017-02-17 02:31:46
We can say that when it's more than a scrape above 1000 USD/BTC for more than a month.
Being comfortably in the millibit era means we'd be confident that long term (6 months plus), the price would never drop to anything near 1100 or 1150.
We're not there yet.
We're still very much in the "yeah, sometimes above 1 dollar per millibit, but looking at the past 6, 12, 18 months, pretty much always below it" era.
(despite how much you or me would like to hype it otherwise.)

I think people here miss the point a bit.
The purchase of pizza for bitcoin was important (not some bad investment mistake) because it was the first thing to give bitcoin any kind of value at all in the real world.
There simply was no BTC/USD exchange rate then. Like how now there is no, say, upvote/USD exchange rate. There was no way of saying 1 bitcoin is worth x in dollars, or euro, or pizzas. It was just 1 bitcoin existing on it's own.
This transaction was literally the first exchange rate for bitcoin. Before it, bitcoin had no value. After it, 1 BTC was worth (1 pizza / 10,000). 
OP calls this infamous as if it was a dumb move, as if the buyer should be kicking himself now. In reality, he started the whole idea that BTC might actually be worth something in the real world. (before this exchange for pizza, it was worth nothing. Or worth something maybe akin to a quantity that people don't really know the value of, and one that doesn't really matter. Maybe like an upvote, or less).
The choice of 10,000 was surely arbitrary, the choice of it being worth 1 pizza was arbitrary, but hey, that's how it started and the market went from there.

Are you on Windows? Maybe you can try this: 
I have it on Ubuntu, I don't remember how I got it though. It took a bit of googling (and trusting some unknown websites which normally I wouldn't do for bitcoin stuff, but I had nothing to lose).
Somehow a few months ago, I must have gotten past those slides you're talking about. I think creating the new "safer" wallet (shouldn't need your 2nd password), and sending the coins from the old one to the new one (needs 2nd password) should be two different steps, it seems I was able to do the 1st step even though the 2nd step failed.
Have you tried to contact support?
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:44:36
Exactly the same thing happened me. Old wallet from 2013 I hadn't tried to get coins out of in years. I went through support many times and had no way of getting my coins out. No way to change or remove my 2nd password either. If I tried to send them, after entering 2nd password I got send failed:  (and if I entered a different password, I got incorrect password, so I knew the 2nd password was correct.)  Does yours say send failed or incorrect password if you try to send coins out?
The seed idea (HD Wallets) wasn't there in 2013 though. My coins were still in the older style of wallet, and I couldn't move them to the newer one (or anywhere).  The blockchain.info page was showing two types of wallet for me. I don't have it open in front of me now, but one in a section called "My Bitcoin Wallet", this is the newer HD one with a seed, but my coins were all in the older one under something like "Imported Addresses".  Are your coins definitely in the type of wallet which has a seed? ("My Bitcoin Wallet") Mine weren't. If they're in the Imported Addresses section, the HD seed won't help you. (You say you're being asked to upgrade account, which makes me think your coins are in the older style.)
Do you have an old backup of your wallet? This was the only way I could finally get my coins. I luckily had an old backup in my email. (filename wallet.aes.json), and I was able to import that into an old version of Multibit (you need 0.5.17 for this, newer versions removed support for the old blockchain.info wallet backup format). This asked me also for my 2nd password, and thankfully this worked. (Support were also able to send me an old backup, but it was my own backup which I used.)
There should be a PSA done here for anyone who has left coins in a blockchain.info wallet since 2013 to try to get them out, as I imagine many others can see their wallet but don't know they'll have a lot of trouble trying to get them out.

Why would a cloud mining company sell you access to their miners instead of using the miner themselves?
The answer is because they make more profit from you paying them than they would from mining bitcoin. In other words, you'll lose money.

Buying at $800 is about as smart as selling at $200.
Should think of doing the opposite at the $200 case.
At $200 the natural feeling is that bitcoin is losing value and you should just sell. At $800 you feel wow bitcoin is really valuable I need to buy more. If you followed that initial instinct and bought at $800 and sold at $200 you'd be a poor man very quickly.  The smart money in bitcoin does the opposite.
@_date: 2016-06-08 12:40:58

I agree, I think bitcoinity jumped the gun last time and switched to mBTC too early (how long was it above $1000/BTC last time, a day or two?).
@_date: 2016-06-19 08:36:12
My only regret in bitcoin was buying above $800 last time. It's important to remember that the price *will* crash again (that's undeniable, just a question of when and at what price).
I personally think it will drop back below $600 at some point. Maybe not this week but sometime in the next year or two.
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:17:32
Number of people mining will drop if it's not profitable, leading to lower hashrate, etc..

Seems most posters here (and me) don't really know and are only guessing, maybe ask on bitcointalk forum?
My two satoshis is that what you want is in the smaller file, the backup of your keys should be tiny, a few kilobytes, not 10 megs.

Human fear, greed and panic.
Once a sell off starts, it's hard not to get caught up in a chain reaction. It's easy for everyone to say "HODL!" etc when the price is rising but it's not as easy as many think when the price is dropping. 
And it's surprising how some people decide to sell in a crash once you start thinking along the lines of "well I could sell some today for $800 instead of missing out by waiting until it's $700 tomorrow or $600 the day after. I'll just cash out now while the price is high and buy back in when the price is cheap and double my coins".
I'm not saying selling is the right thing to do, I'm just saying it's harder to hold when you're watching a crash.

I've had bitcoin since 2012 and it's great seeing the price rise but I don't see how people think bitcoin will end banks and replace USD. It just doesn't make sense to me.
Having banks is a service and a very useful one I think. It works for 99.9% of people to have a company take care of your money and pay them a little bit to do it. Yes you can say they charge too much, they're corrupt etc but the reality is that almost the entire population don't care and have no reason to "become their own bank" (which I guess is what the artist imagines the world is like in the OP cartoon).
Same for cash, coins, banknotes, etc. All that stuff just works fairly well as far as I can see. I love bitcoin and want to see it accepted everywhere but I see no reason why the convenience of cash would be replaced. (or USD, which is an institution backed by people far more rich and powerful than you, me, this sub times a million, and doesn't get replaced just like that.)
I believe the price is rising because of pure speculation by people and investment types who aim to cash out when it's at the peak of the next crash. It's not being driven by any recent improvements to bitcoin technology itself.
Rambling post but I see so many posts like this cartoon which are just the fantasies of the OP in a cartoon, but I don't see any future reality in which that would happen.

Now is one of the best times to sell there ever has been. The price has only been higher than this for a space of a few weeks back in 2014.

Agreed. I'm a big bitcoin fan, I've had some since 2012, but I really think that we've already seen a huge amount of mainstream coverage.
I mean everyone has heard of it, no they don't know all the details of how it works, but that's not really gonna change much.  Yes awareness and knowledge will increase in future generations, but it won't among 40+ year olds in my opinion.  I'm not one of those people who think Bitcoin will replace fiat, replace banks etc.  Fiat works. Notes, coins, cash, it's convenient, it's easy, everyone's granny has been using it for ever. That won't go away. 
Banks too. They provide a useful service for people to store their money and they charge a bit for it. Yes we can say they're corrupt, their fees are too high, they steal and launder money in various ways, etc, but 95% of the public do not give a shit, and I kinda see why they don't. It just works for them, they don't have to think too much about it. They've no incentive to change. Which is fine with me I suppose.

I think implementing SegWit and fixing the asicboost should be two separate issues.
They clearly are separate goals, and I think if we're honest, the reason people are combining them is in order to get SegWit implemented faster.
Which doesn't sit well with me. I want SegWit implemented, but for it's own reasons, not using arguments about fixing asicboost to prop up the arguments for SegWit.
The arguments for SegWit should be strong enough on their own to get it done.

OK, thanks.
Sounds like the usual advice regardless of August 1st. Is there some reason to do with August 1st that it becomes especially important?
(as a total side note, it appears that for new wallets you can't export your private key from blockchain.info any more, you can backup your phrase seed once only from what I can see. If you don't have that, you can only send funds from your wallet to another one the normal way)
