you didn't; I'm just kinda in shock right now. I'm pissed that I could have stopped the second transfer but had no way to contact coinbase, and STILL have been ignored to this point
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:37:47
how is this not on the front page? coinbase should not be trusted until they can prove their API is secure

2FA is on a seperate device
Heres my api key screenshot

Honest question: If we can't trust coinbase, who can we trust?
Even if I had 0 stored on cb they still would have purchased 10 via my CC and sent them out all because the app has some vulnerability.

THIS is the problem. I cannot believe I just lost so much
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:22:36
Yes well as of now I have no money and feel like shit
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:41:25
yes, immediately
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:38:36
update: I have now been contacted by coinbase
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:05:34
I understand the 12 BTC I should have in cold storage, but the attacker was able to instant buy 10 BTC and send them out. 
Others have commented on how the iOS app pin feature does not work correctly. I did nothing wrong other than trust this app, how else am I supposed to protect against instant buy? I've been a long time customer of coinbase and have transacted with them in the 25k range and NEVER had a problem till now

This post is 50% "please someone from coinbase please help &amp; stop ignoring me", and 50% a "public service announcement". 
I would NOT use or the coinbase app or store coins on coinbase at this point. If you have instant buy enabled I recommend disabling it until this is resolved.

I thought 2FA on a seperate device AND the app pin would be enough. 
Also, even if I had 0 coins stored on CB, instant buy is still vulnerable

any coinbase rep can click that link and see my account. Ill post more proof momentairly
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:54:29
i didnt "let" anyone touch my phone
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:01:33
I believe I do, it is required for the app. I have never had any problems with it before, and I've had the app since it came out. Can they purchase AND send via the API key?
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:57:06
as requested: 
Note, the 10BTC instant buy and 10 BTC transfer out happened within the same minute, the 12 happened after
