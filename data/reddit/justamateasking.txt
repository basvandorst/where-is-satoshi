As in?
What is the wallet address the funds were sent to?

AlphaRho49165 YOU ARE THE BOMB!!!!
THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH.
Your advice on, 'Settings, then click: addresses, then click managed address, then click: show addresses", worked like a charm. 
This particular nipple head had Archived one of my addressees, and had forgotten that I'd done so.
Un-archived the address, and there are the funds waiting for me
You don't know just how happy I am now that I've fixed this stupid issue.
THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH :)

BIG THANK YOU for  
Provided me with the confirmation I needed.
Ok. What I mean by, "...I am unable to enter that Bitcoin address into my account to collect the sent funds", is, I used the Receive option within Blockchain to obtain a wallet address for my customer to send me funds. Customer sent the funds and confirmed doing so by sending me an email with the confirmation notification etc. But when I went back to Blockchain wallet to confirm receiving the funds, the funds were not received, and the wallet address has changed.

Fully understand about the faking.
As I have just discovered
I was given a link by AlphaRho49165 to  and the transaction is confirmed, but NOT for the amount that was supposed to have been sent.
I have just contacted the individual and requested their input as to why the total funds sent do NOT match up to the bill amount
Would you know if there is still a way to claim a transaction that has not come to your wallet? (In case this issue happens again in the future).
THANK YOU again for your help and input on this issue

Not independently no.
I am going by the senders screen shots, and forwarded transaction confirmation emails that they have received
The wallet address I gave them has not received any funds paid into it, hence why I am confused by this issue.
The wallet address changes each time. I have received numerous payments within the wallet, again, using different wallet addresses. 
But this one payment seems to have gone astray.
If it wasn't for it being over $2K, I would cut it off as a loss. But now I'm also concerned to give out another Bitcoin address, in case the same happens again.
Oh. And thank you for helping with this. I DO appreciate it
