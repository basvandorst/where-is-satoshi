C I tried modeling my code after the examples they listed, but I'm not doing something right.

Looks good man. We are about to have so many more options for US based Bitcoin exchanges:
1. [CampBX]( 
2. [Coinsetter](
3. [CoinMKT](
4. [Kraken](
5. [Atlas](
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:04:31
I didn't know that existed. Thanks for pointing that out.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:22:53
When was the last time you deposited into CampBX? I believe this is a relatively new feature (like within the last week).

Check the edit in my comment, I made a quick Google spreadsheet.
@_date: 2013-07-10 17:58:14
Good call, thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-15 00:45:57
I would like to join in as well. Should we set up some kind of official sign up sheet with contact information? Or will all communication be done through Reddit?
EDIT: I made a quick [Google spreadsheet]( The document is public, so anyone who is interested can add their information.

As far as I can tell, you are correct. But if you are looking at ASICMiner as a long term investment, keep in mind the block reward halving in 2016. That would have a large affect on the dividend return.

To me, this is why bitcoin is so valuable. Just look at how long and expensive the process of sending money to someone in say, Quito Ecuador is. Bitcoin makes sending money to foreign places so easy.
@_date: 2013-05-22 13:31:20
Ah, I see. Thanks man.
@_date: 2013-07-11 13:59:53
Cool, thanks man!
But could you please explain what you mean by 'sponsor a prize pool' (I checked out your website, but I couldn't get to the 'how it works' page).
Unfortunately, I don't think I we will get enough people for this post; people seem to think its a good idea but no one is actually signing up. I think I'll end up making another post next week (with concrete dates, time, and tournament format), and reach out to some other Reddit communities as well.
@_date: 2013-06-15 16:09:22
Thanks for catching that. Fixed now.

Their customer service is amazing. They were the only exchange to verify my account in under 24 hours. I opened a support ticket yesterday and they answered it in under 12 hours (I got a response at 3 in the morning).

I'm just going to set up private games, and invite everyone. I've never had problems with anyone cheating in Halo on live, so I don't think we'll need to worry about it.
If someone is blatantly cheating, I will boot them (but again, I don't think this will be much of an issue).
Just Halo at the moment, as that is the I game I feel most comfortable running a tournament for.
@_date: 2013-05-15 02:42:53
I have been using them for about a year now; never had any complaints about their service.
@_date: 2013-07-11 15:45:14
Wow, that would be great, thanks man!
And yeah, not as many gamers here as I hoped. I think I want to set up the tournament next weekend, so early next week I will create a post in some other subreddits with information about the tournament and how they can get started with bitcoin if they aren't familiar.
If you are still interested, I'll send you a PM next week with concrete information about tournament.

Liqpay is not a deposit option anymore. I even tried to use Liqpay --&gt; OkPay --&gt; BTC-e but OkPay won't let you send any funds from Liqpay to BTC-e.
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:42:54
Cool, when we have enough people, I'll post the date and time and you can let us know if that works for you.
Given enough interest, I would like to make this a semi-regular occurrence. And beyond that, I would like to set up a website and side business of running tournaments for different games. So I guess this initial Halo tournament is my minimum viable product. With that in mind, I would like to start building up some trust within the bitcoin community, so I would like to handle the BTC myself . Plus, I think using escrow just makes things unnecessarily complicated. 
However, if the majority would feel safer entrusting a third party (which is understandable), I will do something like this:
1. Everyone sends their entry fee to the third party.
2. We play some epic Halo games.
3. After the tournament, I send the winnings (from my own personal account) to the first and second place finishers.
4. The first and second place finishers inform the third party that I have sent them their prize.
5. The third party releases the funds in escrow to me.
This method will allow the winners to get their funds immediately after they win, while still protecting the participants.

haha that's the spirit! Depending on the response, I would like to play either this weekend (7/12 - 7/14) or next weekend (7/19 - 7/21). If you are ready to play by then, just enter your information on the sign up sheet.

See my comment below respoding to @_date: 2013-04-23 17:37:16
Really? I've never noticed their website being slow.

According to [ASICminer charts]( the mining part of the dividend will be 0.01358 per share.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:38:23
Good tips! I've always wondered how to read that bottom graph.
@_date: 2013-07-08 20:05:04
Can you add a dwolla account to this exchange? Or does it have to be an actual bank account?
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:13:31
While we are at it, what is a 'future'?
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:47:54
Could be, that is a big if. But the bitcoin economy would need to grow significantly to reach that kind of transaction reward per block. Someone else on this subreddit suggested that read that for block reward to get to 15bitcoins per block there needs to be 20 million transactions per day. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:51:15
Ah ok. I'm from the Midwest so I haven't noticed.
I've wondered why more people don't use them, as for such a good exchange the don't ever seem to have a lot of trading going on. That must be one of the reasons.
@_date: 2013-05-19 23:16:08
Do you mind specifying how much the total fees were? I have Wells Fargo as well, and will be doing a withdrawal later this week.
