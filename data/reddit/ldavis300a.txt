Blockchain just gives you the option of "regular" or "priority" for fees unless you go into advanced settings, which it says is for experienced users. I always just use "regular" and never had an issue before this transaction.

I have been using blockchain for years and never had issues before this. My two options for fees were "regular" at $.12 or "priority" at $.95. The only way to change the fees besides these two amounts is to go into advanced settings, but there is a warning there that it is for experienced users so I never changed the fees.
What can I do though? Will the transaction eventually confirm or is it just lost?

It still shows as an unconfirmed transaction and I haven't had anything come back into my wallet... Here's the link for the transaction

I know it's a regular fee because the only option to change the fee is to go into advanced settings, and there is a warning that it is only for experienced users so I have never even been in the advanced settings. I know my fee was roughly $.12 when I sent it and the priority fee was $.95, but I wasn't in any rush with the transaction so I just went with the regular fee. 
If it isn't confirmed soon, what can I do? Is it just gone forever or do I just have to wait until it eventually gets confirmed? Is it guaranteed that it will eventually be confirmed?
