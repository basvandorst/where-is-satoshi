At this point you will never accumulate as much BTC from mining as you will from just buying it.  If you're in the US, [Coinbase.com]( is a hassle free way to buy and sell Bitcoin.  
You can attach a Visa card but any purchases come straight out of your bank account.   Once your bank account is attached you can submit a buy order and your price will be locked in.  Once the bank transfer clears your BTC will be available for withdrawal. 
Whatever service you choose, make sure to use two factor authentication for everything.

Just buy them any method and launder your coins through a series of exchanges by trading into, transferring, and selling anonymous alt coins for fresh BTC.  I don't think you owe any taxes unless you sell the BTC that they know you bought.  It will just look like you withdrew your coins into a cold storage wallet.

Well congrats, I'm glad a blatant cheater didn't get first.  
I don't think I was identified as a fake account as I was talking with support reporting the issues throughout the whole competition.  Maybe I just annoyed them too much. 
I traded normally and must have made a majority of my trades with the bots / alt accounts.  I had no way of knowing if the trades were filled from real accounts or not.  
Yea T.W. and M.S. were cheating.  I put a lot of time into it, over 700 trades completed.  I'm a little upset about how this turned out but I'll get over it.

@_date: 2014-09-11 18:50:32
The amount of cheating going on in this competition is a real turn off.  I can't get an order to go through but the same guys in first are trading 200+ BTC back and forth in between the buy &amp; sell spread.  They match the orders perfectly with their other accounts so that they execute before they appear in the orderbook.  You can see it is them because they are the only ones with that much money.  It is obvious that they are using multiple accounts to feed themselves money.  
[They have been trading back and forth for days](
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:51:47
It could go any way at this point.  I was in the top 10 with only one account, but I got really lucky a few times by getting a trade filled from one of those orders that were way outside the books.  I don't know how it worked by some of my orders were filled.  I'm pretty sure if all the fake accounts were gone there would have been zero volume throughout the competition so I have no idea how many of my trades were legit.

I have several ideas with varying risk factors and ethical implications.  
1.  Make a long private key that you can't remember and break it into 4-5 pieces, then set a series of delayed emails to send you those pieces in seven years.    There are services you can use like [Email Alibi]( but who knows how long they will be online.  There is a way to delay emails with gmail/outlook as well, but you would know the passwords to your account and be able to cave.
2.  Load it into an encrypted paper wallet then put it in a safe at your closet grandparents house.  Ask them to leave it there and write you in their will as the beneficiary. 
3.  Shave the top of your head and get a tattoo of your private key QR code.  Get a hat and let your hair grow in.
4.  You could always try being less of a pussy.  Buy a refurbished beater laptop, put your wallet in cold storage, hide the laptop in darkest room in your residence.

I assume they will sell in a crash just like any other panicked investors, however, I think that they are still stuck trading during open market hours.

You don't need a calculator.  When you are ready to buy it will calculate your total for you based on the amount you want to purchase and the current market price, + 1% fee from Coinbase and $0.15 bank transfer fee.  You don't have to buy whole Bitcoins, I buy ~$100 worth a few times a week.  Keep in mind once you make your first purchase you won't be able to initiate another until your first one clears.  Once your first one clears you can buy and sell often as you want within your verification limits.

A website that compiles all Charities that accept Bitcoin.  When a charity receives a donation through the site, Ron Paul it's happening gifs pop up everywhere and the American anthem starts playing in the background.

They are dumping hard.  Someone put them back to sleep.

That works fine until something is flagged on your account and you have to prove it is your real name.

Most ad services are at least semi-automated, it is unlikely that CT or CMC even pay attention to what ads pop up there.  
If you have beef with the ponzi scheme your best bet is to contact the ad service rather than calling out individual publishers.

Good luck with that

There is no way to resume that position once you have been margin called.  If you send more BTC to the account you can enter another trade, but settlement is in a few hours so you probably won't get that money back this week.

Shorting it seems to be the best way to make 50%+ quickly.

It was like a month ago but I assume the high doge volume means people are stilling doing that.

@_date: 2015-01-12 00:58:42
Yup, I bought some back then too.  I don't really care if we are still in downtrend, I'm accumulating for the long term.  I'll short it and buy all the way down to $10, then tip professor bitcorn with changetip.

You won't find a concrete answer anywhere but most common speculation is that the bitcoin rally has something to do with the [stock markets plummeting in China](  The CSI 300 Index has started to bounce back and bitcoin hasn't started dumping so IDK if that theory holds water, could just as easily be bored or opportunistic whales.

Hey Mick.  No question, just wanted to say thanks.   I've been using Coinbase for over a year now and have been very pleased with the support team so far. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 00:45:24
Too bad, their charts are so fucking pretty.

You need to use the ledger from a computer than isn't compromised for your coins to be safe.  Trezor keeps your coins safe even if your computer isn't.
IMO the people who don't know the difference between a compromised and non compromised machine are the ones who should buy a hardware wallet, so Trezor seems like the most secure option.

yup. dont bother with ltc or dash, doge worked for me

|You are completely wrong.
I can accept that.
|I don't understand why people have the urge to write stuff when they don't know the first thing about the subjects they present themselves as knowledgeable. 
This is reddit, I don't censor my thoughts.  If I'm wrong someone like you will call me out.  Discussion leads to the right answer eventually. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 00:27:33
yup get ready.  pretty soon everyone will be sending us doge tips
