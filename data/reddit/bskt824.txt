This is weakest evidence for "fraud" that I've ever seen. Not saying it isn't...but at least provide some sort of actual evidence.

I love how these threads are always started by the guys who got in when BTC were worth pennies. I'd probably be pretty calm too if my investment had netted me 50000% in 2 years.

Only r/bitcoin would get cynical about a company adopting the currency they are trying to get companies to adopt. Every other post in this sub is about some company promoting their acceptance of bitcoin, who cares if it's veiled marketing or outright marketing? The end result is the same...more companies accepting bitcoin.

Actually this is the perfect reason to stash a C-note in your car for emergencies. Or to carry at least 2 different credit cards from 2 different banks.
Also, if you can't pay, most parking places will let you exit if you fill out a short form with your info (like name, address, and DL) where they can send you a bill.
But hey, bitcoin!

No, it's something they've been doing for years, because it's against their TOS. People in this sub just look for any type of news that could even tangentially related to a possible good sign for bitcoin adoption.

Title is somewhat misleading. Manta didn't just email 30 million companies. They have 30 million+ listings because they regularly scrape state corporation registration databases for company info and make each company a page, whether the company is aware of it or not.

I don't see the problem with this. Credit card processors charge 2-3%, so the gas station is offering people who pay with cash a 10 cent/gal discount. The customer gets cheaper gas, and the gas station saves money on processing fees. Win-win. The only party that "loses" is the credit card processing company. Who cares?

They get users because companies find that this manta company has created a profile for them, and often has incorrect information, so they want to correct that info, and be in control of it. Hell, it even says as much in that article you posted.
Manta is basically the "mylife" of the corporate world. Putting up profiles for people and then charging them to change/edit it.
