10 months old, just saying
@_date: 2016-08-18 14:58:35
If you don't control your private keys, obvious.
If they know what amount you have, also obvious, because they can charge you with a debt of that amount. Period.
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:15:04
how many times will people complain that coinbase is snooping?
just stop using it already
@_date: 2016-04-16 12:17:47
come one, that was clear from the beginning, constantly over the last 2 years there were reddit posts coming up complaining, ppl are like frogs.

also circle, btc-e,.. what else? and more important why?
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:49:44
Thats exactly what i'm doubting, i foresee a society that behaves more like competing prides of wolves in gated communities. There are a lot of things we benefit from the state.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:15:05
wrong, the real question is: where can i buy bitcoin with a kindle?
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:54:51
If you're the minimum wage guy type, now is a great time to skip food and go full ramadan in order to buy bitcoin instead.
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:07:25
why would you pay for a stream that for YOU is inappropriate?

@_date: 2015-06-11 23:50:22
it should be on reddit frontpage everyday, there are still people who don't know about it, and use cb without being aware.
therefore its important to constantly alert about the situation.
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:18:13
also this is kind of lol, because they could have privately registered that domains or handles the day before they bought it with company money. they were in use before by some individual, right?

title maybe a bit misleading, yet it is true that they track and way worse they rob you based on suspicion what might have happened in their opinion, that's mob law and in no way justified.
Hence coinbase should be avoided.

@_date: 2015-06-15 10:57:31
so, a seed generates always the same private key, then you can iterate from this private key to the next as long as you want.
suppose the gap limit was 40 for the first wallet app and you used 34.
restoring HD seed on a new wallet app with a gap limit of 20, neglects the 21st to 34th addresses. if you have btc stored in there it wont show you the correct amount?
numbers are probably way off, what is the usual gap limit for wallets?
so the wallet needs to check either the blockchain if the sequential addresses have balance or have been used or an api of some provider.
are there some privacy/security implications if you check a (probably huge) set of deterministic addresses with some api provider? (1) they know they all belong together (2) attack vectors knowing the addresses

voluntary fees for the state or a mechanism where they can control or threaten people somehow to give their share?
or no state at all, with decentralized organization that seek funds on their own to build streets, pay teachers, police (as private security) etc.

best way to accept bitcoin?
today i was at small local grocery store and the staff was heating up about banks and commissions, problems and how they feel banks and governments exploits small enterprises and take away big cuts.
I would have liked to throw in a bitcoin solution, but i'm not sufficiently informed about the simplest and easiest way to do. I might come back and present them a single solution, including hardware, software, security, accounting guidance. e.g. bitpay + tablet or merchant terminal etc.
How to install bitcoin with limited vendor skills (handing out products, pressing on touchscreens, saying hello, thanks and goodbye)?
@_date: 2015-05-20 08:27:56
well, they can attack it on way more levels than just cryptographic
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:13:20
i just thought, when it really would happen, that everybody claimed his gold, price would rise, because someone is short in gold supplies, but when that happens there would also be sellers and those short on supplies could buy from those who sell, there is a fractional equilibrium in there. it will always be like that, that some don't have enough to cover their promises.
same with btc, actually that's the economic circle.

20 years ago: "we have an awesome new messaging system, called email, everybody can send and receive messages to other people, hosted on your PC at home"
now: big providers divide the market, everything is completely supervised, nobody hosts it's own server.
also: before bretton woods (paper is redeemable for gold), now (cash flow is restricted (you know, terror, etc) and banks have control over your funds).
this will happen again and again, oh look in five years most of the btc is in coinbase and the other 4 big providers, because it's so convenient and nearly all big stores are connected to their checkout/payment system because only they have the license. I could manually withdraw it but when I put it again on some exchange or somewhere else I would have to explain to authorities, where they come from, they have it all tracked.. too bad so i just leave it there.
it's the convenience of the people to give away the power of control - and it will always be like that.
sorry for buttering, i don't think it might necessarily lead to that, but it's still a possibility.

i haven't looked into it, but crypto is nothing trivial, i hope the concept is water-proof. many services that claim they are "nsa-proof" have had flaws. "go away nsa" is maybe not the appropriate wording.

I refer to the actual system right now, almost all people agree to pay their share when doing business (whether it be in production, distribution, service, etc), there is not a massive scale of violence involved. whether you like it or not, it's better than living in somalia right now.
but they can simply enforce it because with the help of the banks they can track and threaten to seize funds.
with bitcoin and decentralization they have much less of this power.
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:07:48
valid point, but still it's not directly linked to communication channels, just better to not have one company control all of your actions. never support monopolys from being built.

Freedom vs AML. What do you want?
@_date: 2015-04-06 09:33:27
so basically you are forced to keep money in the bank for a time (3rd party holds it, which is not under your control)
you have to pay fees for a service you are forced to use
it takes time
people with no residency/proper papers are excluded from participating in business (discrimination)

face values are in euro, so when you open it and see less in there, you're probably disappointed. (it's probably always less because of fees (either for buyer or recipient)?!).
it would be better to have a face value denominated in btc, the buyer would have to pay an uneven amount of euro, but especially when you us it as a gift, the value in btc remains the same.

no trading fees is a strong move!
and about the withdrawal fees, in their terms they probably included that they may change them without prior notice to an arbitrary percentage.
on a theoretical thought could gox have just risen the withdrawal fees to 50% and so avoided all the hassle?

@_date: 2015-03-31 12:14:12
That's why bitcoin is a so disrupting technology. Financing the state was kind of easy with the state/banks as a powerful middleman, additionally there was the stupid man's tax (inflation/money printing) that diminishes the savings (frog in the water).
But still: Inequality and fight against poverty/people marked by fate still needs to be done.
Societies probably need to change and adapt somehow, I hope it will be a smooth and peaceful transition.

if you hold dollar you are incentivized to keep on consuming, whether it's loads of crap, chinese plastic or things you value. with no inflation you only buy the things you desire. maybe this is bad for the measure we apply to our economy that has to grow every year or it's drama time (crisis).
it could be good for ethic consumerism.
@_date: 2016-10-30 11:01:58
Pumping money into securities and bonds, so the value of stocks remain stable, but everything else gets diluted, aka the wealth of a small saver.
So the small saver has less and needs to work harder or innovate. Boom, economy saved on the backs of the people. Sisyphean life exposed.

what would a possible attack on the network look like tampering with the "network-adjusted time"?
you don't have to be a miner to attack the network, only a network of nodes?
imagine you had 51%  of nodes which is ~4000?
can you mess with difficulty controlling 4000 nodes?
i guess there already exists a detailed risk assessment, does anybody have a link?
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:04:58
better start mind controlling, because if you have a hammer the only way to make sure you don't want to misuse it (throw it at someone), is knowing what you think in this moment.

the most important question regarding markets, finance, social welfare education in the end turns out to be: how can the state/society finance itself? or how do they "take away" money or values from people in a fair way, obviously the discussion needs to be done again, when there's a techological shift in society.
