If you have bought a seed storage, you put your wallet seeds inside by yourself. Who else can steel your coins? It is **much safer** than you put them on a paper or in a computer.

It is glad to see the price goes up so sharply. And with the value of the coin increasing, it is better to use an hard ware wallet to help u to manage ur asset.

2. USB is eay to be eliminated in the future. However, bluetooth connection is more of a future-oriented solution. You can have a look at the hardware wallet called BitHD. [BitHD.com](
