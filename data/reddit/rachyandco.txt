Sending a message to blockchain.info will not change anything, they don't control the blockchain (the real one). 
Wait for some hours, maybe a day. Your transaction will be flushed from the mempool at one point and you will be able to resend. With a fee.

What swiss authorities and swiss banks do not realize is that there is another secrecy that is still strong: data secrecy. Try to get data from a swiss datacenter without a swiss judge decision. And bitcoin is "just"data.
So next will be an attack on data secrecy. But this is a more direct on human rights... we 'll see how the swiss reacts, but looking at how resistance is growing against the swiss mass surveillance project.. there might be some interesting scenarios for the future.

It is a matter of decision making and gaining trust in it. 300 years ago some foolish people started to print money on paper. With the printing technology we were able to elaborate a much more vivid economy based on paper contracts and not natural law. But paper money in a natural law environment did not work out. We needed a government trust structure build on this same technology, paper: declaration of human rights and a constitution. Of course we needed a couple revolutions in between.
With the digital world, we go one step further: money and contracts are now also digital. This will enable really our digital economy to move on.
But if paper was relying on a single secure printing shop to avoid false money to be created and create thus trust, bitcoin is relying on distributed computers creating security. So this is were we have distributed computed trust.
So we will also need soon some new types of governements. 
Will bitcoin be the "assignat" of our world and loose all its value soon?. Who knows. But crypto currencies are not moving away.

Transparency on the network is a key feature of the decentralised society. It is up to us to build privacy on top of it.
If you look at the traditional bank system, it is 100% secret and governments have been forcing it to become transparent, killing privacy in the way.

Pretty massive tool. This means we would have our blockchain around us. 
Some challenges:
- what about other blockchains. When a more powerfull blockchain like ethereum takes place..  How would we choose which blockchain to transmit.
- this brings the regulation part... Radio emission in centralized and regulated. How to be sure the radio is transmitting the right blockchain?
- security: How can we be sure the broadcasted signal is good. Spoofing can be easy with a small emitting device ?

Egypt had a kill switch, it took less than 3 day for internet to come back. Syria, less than 1 day through mesh networks. Ukraine has working internet and cellphone networks. 
Fukushima suffered an earthquake, a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown, internet was the only working thing in the region.
So bitcoin is more resilient than credit cards. Because Internet is the most resilient invention. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 17:23:38
When i mean resilient it is both humans and network aapecrs. Egyptian internet was reconnected by human beings as telecomix. But at the end internet itself is resilient as human action is part of internet.

Well, let's imagine you replace all USD by bitcoin. The 2014 M2 for USD is 11000 billions. Make a stupid division by 21 millions and you ve got 1BTC for 500.000

A very simple reason is not mentionned in the article.
In many countries there is a difference in law between "money exchange" and "money transfer". For exemple in Switzerland, only licensed professional can do money transfer. And they are obliged to take an ID even for 1 euro/chf transfer.
Compliance is one of the reasons the prices are high. And Compliance comes from fear.

You are missing few facts:
- new services are being built where bitcoin is merely the transportation layer. For the user, no difference, he puts in usd he got usd out. But these services will be faster and cheaper.
- bitcoin is not only money. It is an asset ledger. The blockchain is starting to become a shared memory, refering to other assets. 
Yes, This could be done with something else than bitcoin, but for now this is the only place where you can build new financial services without being hampered by traditionnal finance. The same with http services in the 90s: any developer could benefit fully of its innovation without paying IP fees for exemple.

@_date: 2016-07-05 13:05:40
Yep, but exchanges hold money from their customers. They have an obligation to protect the funds. Part of it is in cold wallets. All of this has a cost. 
If you don't want to bear this cost, selfhosting is the way.
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:31:41
Agreed it is not related to cost. Misread that part. But big exchange users, that use exchange to exchange and not as a wallet, also use the API to make such actions. The API call to withdraw is done with the full amount ( including the fee) it was up to us to compute the fee in our system. This is important as when you automate  you need to be sure of your cost. Adding a fee to your withdraw request is much more easier than keeping trace of all fees in your shadow balance.
So yes it is not meant to be used as a wallet, and exchanges have designed their API to accomodate their biggest customers (probably).
Maybe someone from an exchange could give a light on this
