Where is this "this" you are speaking of? I mean all that is happening now is just specultaions, no one knows where the company is at and what will happen with it in short or long term.
But in a way you have a point, they should have stopped trading on the exchange for the time it takes them to address whatever the issue they are addressing.

Indeed, the "insolvency" claims came all from a third party source of some kind. This is all rumour at the moment and nothing else. Not saying it will not turn out to be true, but it's not written in stone as of yet.

If you still have the DRK hold it, it's a small bump in the road really.

I see it this way: "we are in talks to sell our business to more competent people and the recent FUD across the internet makes it harder then it should be, therefore we decided to spare them the shittier start then they will already have"

Not sure if troll or really excited by the update.

At least it's some form of statement, we should all go to a pub grab a beer and wait for all this to blow over.

Man you have no idea what you are talking about. It's the HTML code of their index page.

Or getting ready for reopening under new management. Which would not be a bad thing.

Yeah you might be right there, edited the comment to reflect it

There is/was a know issue with some implementation of stratum that was discovered by some russian guy whom started abusing it on different altcoins. The guys in the ANN thread for DarkCoin pinpointed it and got the stratum dev to patch it. Basically it allows you to get every single share accepted by the pool. So if pool is paying out for the invalid shares it will be robbed. 
This is the explanation by the rusian guy that stumble on it:


Let me find the relevant links...

I call the "insolvency" part will be edited in few minutes. If not they should provide the source of the news to the general public.

Comparing cap is miningless when there is a difference between the amounts of available coins.
Food for thought: Aurora and Litecoin did not bring anything new to the crypt table, DRK on the other hand ...

I don't get the hype about this at all. This looks to me like a centralised solution, which is completely on the opposite end of the fundamentals of Bitcoin. I mean if they are based in states the gov will still find a way of getting the information from them, look at lavabit. And to be frank I do not believe they will have lavabit owner balls to stand up to the government.

If this situation pans out and Gox allows full BTC withdraws again... I swear I am going to go back through every single one of your posts and make sure you went through every single one of his ..... ahhh fuck this

Get ready for downwotes, objective thinking does not seem to belong on this subreddit as of late. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:53:45
At least there is some sort of communication, it means the guy has not vanished (yet mind you)
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:51:17
Unless the company is preparing to "re-open" under new management. This might be an option as well and being someone that has some BTC stuck there I do hope this is the case.

Not asking for proof, and not saying the outlook on the current situation is "good news". Though again it's all a speculation at the moment, it might indeed turn out to be true in the end, but there is still a nail missing in the coffin if you know what I mean.

how does he know that there is the inevitable "This account is new!" if he does not use reddit? hmmmz I smell bullshit

Hard to determine indeed.

Darkcoin incorporates this in the coin code, I recommend you have a quick look at that as well if you're interested in anonymous transactions.

Imo twobitidiot is exactly what it says on the tin, an idiot.
He spread shit ton of FUD which he has not proof for, changes his mind when he see it fit. He should get his facts straight before posting shit around.

This will probably cause the price to plummet in the next few days on there. Wonder should I sell the BTC I have there and try to get back at lower price 
Thought in the end it might be a phantom trading anyway. :(
