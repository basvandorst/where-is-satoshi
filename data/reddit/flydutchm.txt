Thx for the reply,  the reason I ask this question is that after some research, it seems although bitcoin is a good innovation, it is having problems now. I am trying to find out whether the problem of the block size is able to addressed by scientific or engineering approach. It seems nobody report such information. I do research in this way so that I can make sure I understand the pros and cons of a new tech.

Thx for your reply, I tried to Google, but did not find much useful relevant info, can you share me some website links? With regard to the difference between two bitcoins, I feel such block argument is harmful for both of them. If such political issue continues, in the end bitcoin will be replaced by something else

thx for your reply, igadjeed, when you mean network collapse, what do you refer? Is the bandwidth full? That is what I am trying to find out: the bottleneck vs blocksize
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:45:41
Thx for your reply, so the block is just a political issue and nobody do experiment or calculations on it to see why it is like this?

Thx for your reply, ZioTron, please take your time now and if you are free some time later, please help me on this topic.

hi, belvok, thx for your reply. Based on your reply and what i understand from google searching, it makes sense in qualitative way that small blocks are fast to upload, and there is less risk for the miner that spent time to upload it. However, what i am not quite sure about the quantitative analysis on this question, I guess maybe some other people with more technical background can help. Thanks anyways.

Yes, my question idea is like this.

Hello there, I am new to bitcoin and trying to do some study before making some investment. When doing my research, it seems that the bitcoin network is kind of full and it takes hours to send bitcoin. May I ask if there are any scientific or engineering calculations about the 1M block limit?  (for example, in my engineer field of semiconductor fab, if we want to come up with a certain design rule, say xx nm, there are many experiments and/or theoretical calculations done to validate the rule ), etc? I did some google search but did not find much relevant information.
thx in advance.

great thx to you, igadjeed. The whitepaper is nice to read. Now I have a more clear picture about this topic. 
One thing you are wrong is that 4 GB RAM is required for 1M block size, while 8GB RAM is required for 2M block size, 16 GB RAM is required for 4M blocksize, and so on.
I need to look and see where do these numbers comes from. But assume it is true, an increase of blocksize to 2M or 4M is feasible under current technology, as my laptop has 16 G RAM, and I know many people have 16 G RAM or even 64 GB RAM for my friend who do a lot of computation.
p.s. Moore's Law is not obsolete for decades, it is just slowed down in recent years. If you look the change from 45nm in 2008 to 10nm in 2018 (intel), it still applies well.

thx ismith23, very helpful message. I read through both links.
According to what Satoshi said in 2009:
"The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide.  Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost.  It never really hits a scale ceiling.  If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.
By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10.  Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions."
If my understanding is correct, what satoshi said about scaling is based on the increase of block chain size (1M). 
The best processor in beginning of 2009 (servers cpu not counted) is Intel Core2 Q9550S, which is based on 45nm node, 0,82 billion transistors, while in beginning of 2018 the best processor is Core i9-7980XE, which is based on 14nm+ node, estimated 8 billion transistors, we can estimate the performance of best CPU improve by about 10x. 
Now the question comes how will this 10 time CPU computing power impact the blockchain size. It will be best if there are some calculations on how much blockchain size can we have as CPU or other technical specs improve over the years.

hi ismith23, thx for your reply and the link. Yes, satoshi did not give much reason for the 1M limit. It is unfortunate that he is gone and did not give us an explanation how did he get that number.

thx for the input, Rektar and tuber, now I found that the block was increased to 2M, yet it is still full. At 2M, it seems everything is good. Now come to the question, how much larger can it increase based on quantitative analysis or experimentation? It would be nice to find it out.

Hi igadjeed, thx for your reply.
I will reply your questions one by one:
"but you're not volunteering your laptop as a full-time Bitcoin node
You're claiming that because you own a 16GB laptop, that means all the nodes can easily upgrade. The research paper I linked (not the whitepaper), which you didn't read, says that a large proportion of nodes would be lost from the network"
Here I mean in the current time, 16 GB RAM is very feasible, if you have 8GB RAM on your desktop or laptop, you can spent less than 100 dollars to upgrade to 16GB. The reason I am not running a node is simple, I am still doing research on it and there is no need for me to run it. If I invest a decent amount in the future, I will try to run it.
"You made that up
The research paper is waiting for your technical mind to read. Until you've read it, you're choosing to form your opinions on the basis of ignorance"
I did not make it up, look at table 2, 10th row, RAM usage. 
For 0.5M block, 2GB RAM is needed.
For 1M block, 4GB RAM is needed.
For 2M block, 8GB RAM is needed.
For 4M block, 16GB RAM is needed.
For 8M block, 32GB RAM is needed.
You sent me the link for the bitfury paper, and I read it through, do you mean that is the research paper? Or if there is another research paper? If so, can you share it to me? Thx in advance.
