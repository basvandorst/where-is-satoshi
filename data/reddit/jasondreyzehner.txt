The rate on that page is for a volume of 1 bitcoin. You're seeing the effect of [Slippage](
(Though in my experience, BitPay's rates are often higher than Coinbase, presumably because Coinbase has a separate internal exchange effecting their rate.)
Edit: corrected link, thanks @_date: 2014-05-26 16:21:00
An instant, fee-free, borderless, free-as-in-free-speech payment method.
As his/her other business inputs begin to accept bitcoin, he/she can keep a larger and larger percentage of cash flow in bitcoin. (*Bitcoin Split* - one of BitPay's most popular features.)
Rinse, repeat, until fiat is irrelevant.

Everything Steve touches is extremely well done — definitely excited to see him writing a book about Bitcoin.

We have a lot of Apple hardware, but a lot of that is running linux!

Thank you. That's been [corrected](

Thank you Kyle.
Was definitely not expecting such a nice note on this thread :)

Have you considered moving to Atlanta? BitPay's headquarters are in Atlanta, and the bitcoin community here is growing by leaps and bounds. The regulatory atmosphere is also very friendly.
Very low cost of living for a US city (great for bootstrapping), an excellent startup community — [Atlanta Tech Village]( good access to Georgia Tech talent, and lots of support from the surrounding startup and tech industry. 
PM or [tweet]( would love to connect you with others here!

The intellectual theory may not be sound, but at least it supports opposition to a decree of this nature. 
Finding intellectually honest individuals who deliberately place themselves in one of these camps is a different matter entirely...

One need not self-identify as *libertarian* to find [Executive Order 6102]( extremely concerning.
*Progressives* familiar with the intellectual theory behind their movement might be uncomfortable with the legal precedent set in creating an imprisonable offence ("hoarding" a yellow metal) without a democratic process.
*Conservatives* familiar with the intellectual theory behind their movement may be concerned by the usurpation of a political power not delegated to the Federal government in the US Constitution. Not even the Congress is granted the power to *punish* for the hoarding of gold; their power for punishment concerning currencies is for fraud (counterfeiting):


Those who adhear to the [non-aggression principle]( (*Libertarians*) will find this executive order to initiate violence against non-violent parties (without a proper claim to aggressed-property).
And *moderates*, *independents*, or otherwise will almost certainly find it disturbingly Orwellian that the leader of an allegedly democratic government can declare a previously legal (and incredibly common) act to be imprisonable for 5 to 10 years, for allegedly technocratic reasons (to "stimulate" recovery), without an economic proof or study.
This was a landmark event in the history of the development of money, and it influenced [a great number of thinkers]( to consider forms of money not under the control (or potential control) of political entities. Among these thinkers were the Cypherpunks, including [Wei Dai (b-money)]( the very first reference in [Satoshi's original whitepaper](
As [mentions below]( 1975 is the year this order was reversed and gold ownership was re-legalized for average US residents.
Satoshi's message in the genesis block is also relevant:


It is extremely unlikely that Satoshi chose April 5, 1975 by coincidence.

I've been really impressed with Tim's attention to detail in handling regulators. Very clear arguments for more financial and regulatory freedom, in a style that's non-threatening.
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:45:05
Yep: 
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:13:37
This is a very impressive analysis- thank you. 
Sounds like we need some simple PGP level-of-trust visualization tools to make this kind of analysis more readily available.

For those interested in this idea, [*The Politics of Obedience: the Discourse of Voluntary Servitude*]( is an excellent read.

Nice work Copay team!
For those interested, you can follow [Copay development on GitHub]( It's an extremely active project.

Jason from BitPay here- thanks for the feedback! This is something we're constantly working on. We think it's extremely important for improvements we make to work with the whole bitcoin network, so we've focused a lot of effort on [pushing and implementing payment protocol support]( which is already allowing us to automatically collect refund addresses from all updated bitcoin wallets.
So this is happening- you can try it out with the newest version of [Bitcoin Core](
@_date: 2014-04-05 16:58:27
I agree. Unfortunately, it seems a number of ideologies are not so tightly bound to historical, praxeological, or epistemological knowledge.
@_date: 2014-07-17 23:15:33
Looks great! Excited to see Cryptiv grow.
Get Bits is actually aimed at helping bitcoin newcomers find friends who have bitcoin. It's simply a list of friends with bitcoin who are interested in being contacted — Get Bits leaves it up to the user to decide on how to transact. (So it looks like I'll be using Cryptiv when I get messages from friends using Get Bits!)

Ironic: good guy CryptoLocker, exposing poor data security and making government more accountable. 
I'm not sure if this even counts as black-hat, taxpayers deserve to know about bureaucratic incompetence. It's an expensive security review that can't be faked.
