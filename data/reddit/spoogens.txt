FUD.  It has happened before.  BCH is not sustainable.  It is simply another pump and dump from Roger and Jihan.  It has happened before, and people forgot what happened last time.  The miners and the traders are trading into it, and the FOMO people are rushing into it, pumping the price.  They have no leadership, no development team. Price will crash and Bitcoin will go to 10k+.  
It's going to be a nasty couple of weeks though.

Is there a reason you give the warning about investing?  Do you think this is a risky investment?
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:31:28
Yea those are some interesting questions.  I have the same concern.  For me, it's that I don't particularly care if I go broke bc my life was already kind of over.  So this was just one last gamble that I have a good feeling about. Certainly wouldn't recommend others to do it.  I do have the feeling that wallstreet is trying to spread fud to get people to drop their coins.  They badly want coins so they can manipulate pricing better.  Wallstreet is tired of their same old boring crap, so they all want in on this.  
  
I think that right now, there are too many distractions to worry about the issues you bring up.  Longer term, maybe.  But in the very near term, I think that we're going moon badoon.  
  
I was a bit terse with that poster because I got the feeling he was trying to fud.  But you have valid points.  And especially if you have loved ones in your life, or people that care about you (i dont) I wouldn't go all in.  But I would own some !  :D  
  
I know many ppl who are actually putting 5-10% of their portfolio in actual bitcoin.  Which is CRAZY considering how frugal these people are, but hell, it's a good hedge against the market.  Even better than gold right now.  So it's tough to argue with.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:12:06

make sure you have multisig and passphrase.  If you don't have that, you're making a big mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:54:43
The only reason it's been going up is because Roger and Jihan are doing everything in their power to pump it, and the morally vacant traders are hopping on the pump until they figure out it's not going to work.  Then I hope you have an account where you can margin trade or trade options because that baby is going to 0.

@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:11
lmao, I thought everyone was already aware of this.  You're telling me people actually didn't know?  You should also be aware that Roger has worked with many popular twitter users ( for example) to push his narrative AS WELL AS working with the foreign exchanges to ensure they can't handle the volume while people are trying to run for the exits.  HIS exit transactions will go through first, then everyone else will be holding the bags.  Especially the inexperienced traders.  The fact that people don't realize this, wew lad.  Do some more research.  Roger will probably be indicted for massive market manipulation at the end of all this.  
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:22:11
I stand corrected
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:15:34
u gotta do research.  dont use blockchain.info to store.  Use a coldstorage wallet like trezor/nano-s and use an exchange like Gdax/gemini/kraken for buying/trading.  
  
Bitcoin is still in it's early stages, I wouldn't worry about trying to force it.  If you can steadily buy small amounts and end up with 1 coin, you might be a millionaire before too long.  Not many people are going to be able to own one coin.  
   
Also there is always risk. So if you take out that loan for 100k, something unforeseen happens, and now you're in debt, that would be really bad.  
  
I suggest just dollar averaging, learning about it, and don't make it a 'get rich quick' thing.  This is a long game, not short.  
  
Sure the people who managed to see this coming and hold their coins are already rich.  But there aren't that many people who managed to do it.  A bunch of people gave up a ton of coins or lost them.   So I wouldn't cry over spilled milk, just look forward and try to get 1 coin and go from there.

I read that so long ago and needed to refresh this. I facepalmed when I first read it, because I am definitely that god damn donkey.  I also saw some gif from the office today with Michael Scott and the pretzel toppings.  Same feeling.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:58:31
I mean, I would love to, but I'm white af.  I stand out like a sore thumb.  I have no black/spanish/etc in my blood.  I just know how it is down there.  I don't speak spanish very well, I'm worried I would eventually get robbed/killed/held for ransom.  Especially the way shit is right now.  If I had a trusted community down there, I might try it.  But it just seems like a really bad idea from what I have gathered.  I think Richard Heart was down in Columbia or one of those places, and he nearly got fucked up pretty bad.  I don't know the whole story, but they robbed the fuck out of him to my understanding.  Maybe it wasn't one of those place though.
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:23:03
What do you think I should do?  I have traveled.  I just don't really enjoy leisure much.  I like learning, exploring, evolving.  Maybe this sounds completely asinine, but a good example would be- I know nothing about running a hedge fund, but I would like to run a hedge fund so that we could create algorithms based on world economies and market conditions, integrated with world events and human psychology.  I think that would be fun and interesting.  But when you start to talk about keeping books for the company, or protecting the company from litigation with law, or doing some other very specialized thing where the answer exists and IS KNOWN, then I lose all interest and I can't even force myself to do it.  Which is why I have had trouble trying to learn programming for programming sake because I know I can just hire some 10 year expert who can write the code I need.  However, if I had a project that I wanted to develop, and I needed a certain type of code for it to work, I would probably easily learn the code.  
  
Maybe this is the same for everyone.  I don't know.  But I tend to want to go toward the unknown and explore/discover/create, rather than deal with the known.  
  
High chance I sound like an idiot with all of this, but that's where I am. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:06:51
I use gemini and gdax/coinbase.  I used wire for my large amounts (although I did it in pieces to make sure) and then backed everything up on Trezor, stored recovery in 4 secure locations, but nothing is all together.   I have my pin in my brain and in 1 different location than the other passphrases.  I keep nothing in my home, and don't keep anything in wallets or exchanges.  But hopefully in the future, we will have better/safer ways that offer more peace of mind.

@_date: 2017-10-26 01:37:20
personally I never keep coins on exchanges.  Always keep them in cold storage imo. Make sure you are protected by multisig and passphrases as well.   
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:17:18
Not to disagree with you, but I would say this case is slightly skewed. I made my money in a career that nearly put me in the ground, which I disliked a great deal, and which gave me extreme amounts of anxiety that I tried for years to overcome, but could not.  Often the job required being on call 24 hours/day, managing many difficult people, and dealing with very pathological executives.  
  
Now, if you have 10 million dollars, you don't care about this, because you can make art for a living and still make a lot of money off of low risk investments.  You've made it.  But that's quite different than 1 million.  And being 35 years old without a real career, barely able to hold a job, and trying as hard as you can every single day to improve your situation.  
  
Even if I didn't have a million dollars, being in some sort of vocation where I mattered to other people, or that I even enjoyed and could pour my heart into, I would be infinitely happier than I am now.  
  
So the adage is true, and I probably should be happier.  But I feel very overwhelmed, very frustrated, and very hopeless right now.  
  
I even pay a therapist a ridiculous amount of money to help me move forward, but it's not perfect, and there's still a lot of pain and depression.

I was late to the game, got in ~4800.  I'm in for the long haul.  Even if we go back to sub 1000 i'll just hold bc i don't care at this point.  I'll re-evaluate if stuff takes off or in 3-4 years.  Comes out to ~184 coins, so hopefully it does well, but if not, oh well.  Jealous of the people who got in 2011 or whenever.  Can't imagine.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:26:32
man i'm ashamed to admit, but i think it's the fear of my parent's reaction if I was to move out of the country, which is insane considering my age.  But they would absolutey 1000% flip their shit, cut me from all wills, and throw the biggest tantrum you could ever imagine, including probably calling the police on me if I did something like that.  
  
I think my fear of their reaction is keeping me from everything in life.  Has me frozen in place, half trying to do what i want to do, and half not wanting to offend them. It's like a literal duct tape bandaid i need to tear off.  
  
I just feel bad for them, and they make me feel like such a piece of shit anytime i try to do something for myself. Label me selfish, when in fact they are the ones who have always been selfish.  
  
i am wasting my life by not wanting to offend them.  and it has to stop.  i've been so brainwashed by them, it's like i don't have the balls to do it.  it's literally insane.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:48:16

@_date: 2017-10-18 00:36:21
I did the same thing, except I'm 35 and invested ~900k into bitcoin.  I'm using the other 100k for savings and working at a crappy job to get by.  I was going to kill myself anyway, so if it doesn't work, same thing will happen, but if it does, then I actually get to have some good times in my life.  Win win.  Also if you think having 1 million dollars makes you rich, it doesn't.  It just makes you rich enough to realize how poor you are compared to actually rich people.  And it's utterly depressing at age 35 right now to only have that much.  So I advise to try very very hard in life and take education (however you get it) and your work/career (whatever it may be) deadly fucking serious.  Because if not, you end up like me.  Gambling on my own shit life.  
  
Also will say, if it gets to 10 million total, I am taking out 5 million, leaving 5 million in, and will live the life I want.  I'm hoping by 2021 or so, that will be the case.  In the meantime I'm just working on myself and trying to dig myself out of this hole I created for myself due to not taking responsibility because I had an extremely abusive childhood and cannot regulate my emotions well, which led me to float in life and not take command.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:37:42
Sounds fun.  Do you like where you live?  I'm trying to figure out somewhere to move, but I don't really like hanging out with mainstream people that much.  That's probably a general statement, but maybe you know what I mean.  I don't know much about seasteading, but I am kind of surprised that hasn't become more of a thing.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:33:45
I dunno. I would rather just immediately die than live on 80k/year.  I guess it's different for everyone.  I already have things together to take my life if this doesn't work out.  I'm 35, so it's not like I'm still young.

@_date: 2017-10-27 19:26:03

@_date: 2017-10-18 03:01:23
You're right.  If I had a billion, I would, without a doubt, be in startups/venture capital/angel investing. Trying to support people and companies that I want to exist.  I would probably write or produce creative youtube videos on the side for fun.  I would probably want to raise a small family.  
Crypto is something I really want to learn more about.  I would like to learn how to make my own exchange, and maybe start an index or hedge fund related to crypto.  The good part of the community resonates well with me, and they seem to be 'my people'.  
  
I feel bad that I cannot contribute because I don't have a tech background.  I did get my engineering degree, but I'm one of those 'went to 5 total classes, 3.2GPA, crammed for everything' engineers. Not a 4.0 MIT PHD.  
  
I think the reason I haven't is because I feel so far behind. That's why I hail mary'd with my funds because I just felt it was too late and thought maybe I would get lucky, and if not, cya.  
  
But I don't know.  When I talk to you guys, I feel like maybe I can be of some use.  I may not be a guru genius, but maybe I can contribute in some way and make a small living while doing it.  
  
I would be happy with that.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:51:14
Where do you live that you can do that?
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:39:57

I have a hard time doing anything like that right now because I am obsessively driven with trying to get a start with some career and I can't reasonably convince myself that I will make youtube a career, nor would I want to be forced to be in the position to rely on youtube for my income.  It would be great, but I see that as more of a hobby.

@_date: 2017-10-18 04:54:50
I think the difference is, at 2 or 3 million, suddenly instead of 70k, you're making 150-200k off the principle.  That can afford a much more reasonable lifestyle than the 70k.  With 70k income, you can't even rent a 2k/month apartment in most places.  And in most big cities, a 2k/month apartment is pretty low end.  
  
There's merit to what you are saying though.
