So I think he got in around $15,000? Did he take advantage of the countless opportunities to sell between 15k and 19k?

He's about to lose a lot of money.

Yes, a few years ago. Now, unless your definition of "accumulating a lot of wealth" is turning $20,000 into $22,500 and "minimal investment" is $20,000......Then no, you're not going to accumulate a lot of wealth @ $20,000 per coin using a minimal amount of money.
Or maybe 100k here, 500k there, is minimal to you?

Actually let me refresh your memory on how we got to this point.
Me: OP, your dad is about to lose a lot of money if he just got into BTC @ 18k or 19k
You: Actually sir, you can accumulate massive amounts of wealth with BTC, in a very short time, with a very minimal investment.
Me: Wow, you sound crazy! LOL. Unless you have bizarre definitions of "accumulating wealth" and "minimal investment" then it's insane to say this at 20K per coin
You: You don't have to buy a full bit coin....$500 invested and making 1000% return is still a 1000% return.
Me: LOL....1000% return...You are one of those guys that thinks bitcoin is worth 200,000 a coin, huh? All the coins combined are worth $4 trillion, about 1/4th of the entire US economy.
You: I didn't say any of that. Where did you get this 1000% figure. I never said it.
Me: SMH

I got that from u saying 1000% returns on $500 ... and how the S&amp;P isn't going to go up more than about 10% but BTC still can go up another 1000%...
that is where I got the 200k per coin figure. Directly from your comments suggesting it can go up 1000%.

Ah, so you're one of those people that, using your expert analysis, places a valuation on a fake made-up currency used by stoners at 200,000 a coin.
In other words, the currency used by stoners has a market cap of over 4 trillion.
Meaning if you owned all bitcoins you could buyout 100s of the most valuable companies in the world and still have money leftover (@ 200k per coin):
Google ----&gt; 3.75 million bitcoin ($750 billion)
Tesla -------&gt; 285,000 bitcoin ($57 billion)
Ford -------&gt; 250,000 bitcoin ($50 billion)
ATT --------&gt; 1.186 million bitcoin ($236 billion)
etc. etc. and that only adds to $1.1 trillion meaning you have over $3 trillion bitcoin leftover....This really makes sense to you? 
I could maybe see it being manipulated to 50k tops....but I fail to see the reason why it'd be valued over $1000/coin (that puts market cap at 22 billion which is still a little on the high side imo).
