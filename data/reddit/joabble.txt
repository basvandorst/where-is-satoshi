[Here's what I created. Thought I'd give it a shot--I'm entirely not educated about this at all; I could use some guidance tweakage.](
Thanks! :)

I'll absolutely be working on a new iteration with this template. Thanks, glad you like the design!

Its matter of aesthetics. The world map is completely devoured on the back side but the idea that it exists in the design remains. 
The elements that this particular wallet template call for will obstruct some of the design no matter. If I somehow finesse the entire world map into the brief open space I forfeit my original design intentions. You can see my original design in a comment above where the world has equal standing throughout for the most part.

Took my design and applied it to the paper wallet template, I think it turned out pretty good. If you want to use it here are the working files:

You mean that trifold shape? Yeah I can try that out.

So, I came here to get some input and suggestions on what other images I should incorporate into the graphic. As you can see, I've got a map of the world, I want to include a pick axe (mining) and some way to represent the blockchain.
What other imagery should I include? And what do you think of the first draft?
