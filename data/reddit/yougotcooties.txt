I can try. Before the invention, all digital information was infinitely reproducible  so therefore digital money was impossible without the aid of a trusted 3rd party. The Blockchain made digital money possible and required no trusted 3rd party. 
Does it make a difference to the average (Western) man on the street? Probably not..but to me who is slightly distrustful  of governments, it's great! Oh, I also lost my job in 2009 due to the banks fucking everything up for everybody...then lost value in my savings later down the line.
Does it make a difference to less well off countries that don't have easy access to banking? I'll let you figure that one out.
Ultimately though, for me, it's one big 'fuck you' to the powers that be...oh and the decentralisation of most things is A Good Idea in general.
Edit: oh and fuck people who are only 'in it' to make a quick buck...fuck them hard with a wad of rolled-up dollars.

I think a lot of people in the last year think like this...and quite frankly they are just greedy cunts and do nothing but muddy the waters.

I agree it's not sensible to think that you can somehow get by without working buuuuut it is also true that the amount of work we actually have to do to get by nowadays _should_ have dropped more or less in line with the amount of automation in the system. I do see a future where we can choose to work or not as all our basic needs will be automatically provided. That time is not yet but still, I believe that we really shouldn't need to be working 5 days a week anymore.

I would say don't bother risking trading unless you _really_ know the market and if you say you are a newbie then I cannot see how you can. My suggestion would be put it into cold storage for a long time. if you have a lot then buy a hardware device...otherwise generate your own private key on an offline computer, send to that public address and forget about it. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:11:33

In the UK at the time, the Internet was still very much the playground of the nerds (computer-freaks really we didn't really use the term nerds back then) and I saw the attitude that Douglas Adams was describing for myself, being the 'nerd' I was...and still am. And once again (though maybe not since around last Christmas), the nerds are at the edges of technology with their interest in bitcoin. It's always been the same. Digital music wasn't immediately taken up by most for instance. I had always been interested in the fact that I could get a computer to playback sampled sounds and I managed to get all the computers I had to record and playback 'real sounds'. The dream of course, was to have my music collection on my computer and chuck away all these CDs, so after trying all sorts of different codecs, once mp3 came along, I jumped on it.
I don't know where I was going with that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:43:50
You don't have to seal anything but it makes sense to seal away the private key. Leave the public key visible so you can add to it. Also if you ever move the coins, I think you're supposed to move the entire lot.

You seem to be getting downvoted here. Any idea why this is so? BU sounds like a real solution to the big/small block problem.
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:34:32
I know everyone is saying it's absurd to think that somebody else could choose the your existing private key buuuuuut you have ensure the generation of your key was based on a good random number generator. There have been instances of bad ones that have been used and exploited.
Also, and this is me also failing to wrap my head around the vast numbers involved...but _somebody_ has to win the lottery...even a minuscule chance is a chance! It _could_ happen...
The thing that puts my mind at rest is that many databases today use randomly generated 'keys' on tables instead of sequential indexes. I don't think they would be used if the chance of a collision was high enough...unless they check for uniqueness every time...can any else chip in?

It would take them longer to reverse engineer the binaries than look directly at the source-code. I'm with BU on this one, it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:36:53
But the source was being provided along with the executable to the miners?
I agree that running an executable for software like bitcoin is stupid but I understand the reasoning behind the decision to do it this way, this time. Obviously more eyes are required to look over the code before official releases.

They will release the source-code as soon as critical nodes are updated. This is so no nodes can be exploited before the they have upgraded. As far as I can see, there's nothing dodgy going on here.

To be fair to Circle, I expect they have been forced into doing the stuff they've done - like dropping bitcoin buying/selling. It was a great wallet indeed but I don't blame them...I blame whoever/whatever it was the forced them.
Saying that: Somebody I know couldn't even transfer their btc from Circle to Mycelium - there was no option for bitcoin at all. Thankfully, said person could transfer to my Circle wallet and from there I transferred to their Mycelium. Anybody know why they couldn't send directly to a mycelium wallet?

@_date: 2017-01-05 11:49:50
No, I think you misunderstood. I couldn't send bitcoins to a btc wallet address as there was no option on my friends Circle 'app'. The way I had to do it was send it to _my_ circle app (as I was in their list of 'contacts') and from there I was able to send to their mycelium.

Is it an attack though? Was BCC an attack? I thought (naivety probably) that BCC was a result of a disagreement on the fixing of the blocksize. I actually drifted to for a while but eventually came back here...and also sold all my (free?) bcc and converted it to btc because I can't see how it can beat bitcoin.
If, as you say, the whole affair was literally an attack on Bitcoin then...well that's just exactly what 'they' would say a 'small blocker' would say.

So I can't do what I did? Which was (after the fork): 
1. Create new wallet
2. Move btc to new wallet
3. Create bch wallet using private key of original wallet
4. Send to exchange and convert to btc
How can moving the btc after the fork using a regular bitcoin wallet be stolen? If it can't then how can moving the s2x coins affect the btc if they have long gone from that wallet?

the sentence ia disgusting. People are saying "well, he's being made an example of what will happen if you do such awful things". firstly, he did nothing morally wrong, in fact there's a decent argument that he did something morally right - providing safe, quality drugs for people that make the choice to use them. But for any government to take a person's life (life in prison _is_ taking away a person's life) in order to 'make an example' is just horrific and vile. Everybody in the US should feel ashamed of themselves.

It's simple, easy to consume entertainment that makes lots of pop references to (hate to say it) 'geek' culture but mixes in normal sitcom devices like relationships and how different personalities get along. Just like all sitcoms that came before. It just became really popular and, reddit especially, dislikes it for some unknown reason. If you don't like, don't talk about it. It's like the old "you know the person in the room who doesn't own a TV because they're the one talking about not owning a TV". You know, it's basically cultural snobbery.
Disclaimer: I used to watch it, lost interest but if it's on and it's one I haven't seen, I'll watch it but I won't fool myself into believing it's super high-brow or complete crap either.

Well to me it seems pretty 100% clear it cannot work. I once thought that increasing the block size would be a good idea and to a degree I can't see the harm if it's a once in a lifetime event but not I'm not so sure. The size of the blocks would have to be huge in order to handle enough transactions for bitcoin to be as fast as cash. Layers to the network have to be established...I have no idea how this might work at a technical level though. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:23:09
I think what your getting confused with is merchant adoption and technical ability. It is and always has possible to use bitcoin to purchase stuff in a safe and digital way, these are the fundamentals people are trying to point out. Merchant adoption is low and this might be due to difficulties in getting started and lots of negativity surrounding crypto currencies and lack of understanding and appreciation of what has been achieved so far.
@_date: 2018-11-08 12:48:47
I thought this too initially. I made some decent free money from the bcash and bitcoin gold forks. Probably around thousand dollars...worth of bitcoin, never go back to fiat.
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:19:32


@_date: 2018-03-06 16:08:49
Well, not really. Just like my example the transaction from coinbase to your wallet ( Trezor or paper wallet) will be recorded in the the blockchain. I guess the only way is to obscure where the coins go by mixing them all up. I've never used a mixer but there are services for this.  Not sure how legit they are though. Depends.how serious you are about it all. I mean you could just create loads of wallets yourself and randomly move the coins about...but what if the nodes that deal with your transactions record your ip address? The blockchain might not but a non legit node.could record your ip address against the transaction Id. You could use a vpn...but what if the vpn provider records everything? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:53:57
Agreed. This is ridiculous. I agree that getting rid of all the scams is a good idea and if this is the intention then great...but without my tin-foil-hat on, I find this extremely concerning.

You're in trouble, not BTC. BTC shot up because a lot of idiots got on-board. I remember just before it went crazy, a lot of 'facebook' people (wife told me, I do not partake in fb) were talking about bitcoin. Friends who never showed an interest before (even though, I had espoused the virtues in previous years), suddenly started asking questions.
So everyone, 'gets interested' (and by that they though "hey, i can become a millionaire by doing very little), buys loads of btc at over-inflated prices and then cries "BTC IS FAILING!" when it drops back to a normal level.
No sympathy for you idiots.

@_date: 2018-12-22 19:54:41
I dont think you understand. When your btc is on an exchange, you don't have the private keys, meaning that for all you know the btc may not exist. The idea behind this whole thing is to figure out what exchanges are 100% on the level. It may all seem a bit silly but I understand the principle behind it.
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:46:06
ah right brilliant thanks. So, whatever happens, if I have those 12 words I will always be able to re-create the private keys. So, a final question: when people say that Mycelium "works with Trezor" does that mean the same BIP39 algo is used by both wallets?
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:25:56
The problem with all this is because right-wing groups can only use these alternative systems then right-wing groups will be associated with them. So, even if your message is non-right-wing then as soon as you use the alt-system, you will be branded as such.
Whereas the non-right-wing (or, let's just call them 'PC') groups will have no need to change payment providers as they are 'allowed'.
Everybody needs to move to non-opinion-controlled payment systems basically.
