Bitcoin is immortal. You need to understand one important thing. Who started earlier, he has more time and opportunities for development to always remain advanced. And even if Bitcoin will not develop, it will still be the first and only.

Bitcoin, like Blockchain, are symbols of cryptorevolution. When you start to compare Bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies, you devalue this symbol.

Does anyone doubt that the price of bitcoin will rise? Really?

Fresh idea.
This is a bit strange, banning materials with altcoins. As if someone has doubts about the leading position of Bitcoin. Guys, bitcoin first. If there were no Bitcoin, there would be nothing else. Any information about altcoins it\`s all about bitcoin and blockchain. He who possesses real power is kind and magnanimous.

Cryptocurrencies are played in a group. Bitcoin plays drums, Ethereum sings.

We`ve been makin` this video for 2 months especially for the crypto community for Christmas. If you don`t like it, please tell me what`s wrong. Smartphones may display previews with an error. "Marry" instead of "Merry". The artist made a mistake, first uploaded the preview with an error. The picture is replaced, but youtube shows the old one. Girls always think about the wedding only. =) We apologize.
