Is it the Schildbach wallet?  I am running the latest version 3.21 and its showing automatic backups password unencrypted back to beginning of June. 1) install new update  2) add public address 3) back up pword
input the public address to the front page of blockchain.info and see if your coins are still home.
do you have the same phone? the back up from SD card should look something like;
unencrypted, app-private storage
automatic backup on June 2
