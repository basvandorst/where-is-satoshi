Sponsoring a fighter or a NASCAR driver is just a way to show the power of bitcoin. The crowdfunding nature etc the power of community
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:54:21
Does it? Seems to work pretty well on its own. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:55:08
Enough hype open the website already!

several older people I know got serious letters from their investment advisors warning them to stay away from bitcoin

Duh , leaky hot wallet, don you know!

Yes but snap chat contains tons of valuable dick pics that bitcoin lacks. Maybe there can be a way to encode the dick pics right into the block chain.

Isnt jury nullification a legitimate part of the Justice system?  Is it legal gal to suppress evidence souly on those grounds? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:23:35
The reason is when I go to check BTC news I like to check the price too so I get a context of what is happening at the moment, It would just save me from opening 2 tabs.  If people can get the BTC price on r/bitcoin, then it will give the users another reason to visit, besides just reading the same links over and over.

So should I buunor sell?

I agree, read the white paper and call it a day. What they are really saying, is their are going to investigate how they can control it and make sure that it does not interfere with their bread and butter, ass raping people financially. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:40:23
 is their twitter

Crazy ride? This is nothing
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:47:26
They are trying to make bitcoin more like a real bank with compliance etc.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:27:07
@_date: 2014-12-21 20:37:22
Not popular people popular policy
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:15:20
They probably pull your auction for mentioning btc
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:28:32
ok where can I get some redditcoin
@_date: 2014-03-20 20:58:45
There is alot of anti BTC propaganda going around these days. Its very systematic and organized, total smear campaign
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:49:36
I totally agree . bitcoin will survive gox was a joke. Good ridance
@_date: 2014-09-05 00:02:15
Oh I see that seems clunky why not use a web based platform.. Is this app available yet?
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:35:27
I would like to mention that on the yelp andoid app I do not see any way to filter by accept bitcoin attribute
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:57:32
Looks great fuck paypal
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:54:55
they take debit though

its an interesting id for voting and such, what about a decentralized government
@_date: 2016-03-06 21:12:05
So is it online? What's the url? 
@_date: 2015-01-13 22:37:43
Not all of us where stupid enough to keep coins there. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 23:26:12
Dot jinx it
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:57:30
Oh  ok so what about if you have it in coinbase are you sol?
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:54:36
So everyone that owned bitcoin now owns bch?
@_date: 2015-08-22 14:06:19
What ever happened to instant buy?  I used to get my coins right away and now it takes several days.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:22:02
Isn't this safecoin
@_date: 2015-08-23 00:13:25
But it shouldn't be
@_date: 2015-08-08 18:38:01
Is this a new special? 
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:56:16
Coindesk not coinbase 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:22:49
Damn pretty much every industry is in the list. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:27:39
That's an understatement 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:28:42
That's a pretty low barrier to entry into the elite
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:20:36
Or buying and selling anything else 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:36:26
They have been doing this for a while.  I'm surprised it took this long.  Mine was deleted almost immediately and I did not get a fancy explained letter 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:34:38
? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:36:13
This is much needed.  Voat is great for free speech but still can be corrupted by censors.  We need a decentralized solution. Maybe upvotes can be satoshis
@_date: 2016-02-17 12:58:39
Seems fishy wouldn't the FBI just give Apple a National Security Letter preventing them from discussing the back door that they are being forced to create why would Apple have the ability to discuss this publicly? 
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:33:20
Slightly corrupt? 
@_date: 2015-07-09 14:24:28
Maybe we need a sub just for begging 
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:11:07
But it can prevent apple from talking about it right? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:46:39
Thanks that answers it, so nothing to but wait until coinbase does the integration. I assume thats goign to dump alot of BCC on the market at once. 
@_date: 2015-04-22 00:51:52
Why can't it be Web based I don't get why it's os exclusive 
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:32:12
Looking forward to this.  If discounts are universal then bitcoin has a chance

It's not Mobile browser friendly

Can we do this for Walmart.  Getting a 20% discount on a product that is marked up 1000% isn't such a win

Wrong the nsa identified the server illegally.

I know Jordan, he offered me a job once. His team seemed professional and competent.  But I cannot speak for anything beyond that.

Is it because the data is encrypted?  Or just using it to send packets.  I thought it was used for email other things in remote places.  Please elaborate. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:01:15
the premise of the DEA is corrupt at its core, so all individuals within are defacto corrupt from the get go
@_date: 2015-03-31 18:14:08
low level corruption in the us is low, high level corruption is high

Why not run a node and use the ham radio for bandwidth 
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:35:27
This could not be get any better.  
@_date: 2015-03-31 10:37:59
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:44:25
To be fair it sounds like they had one issue with one person of 25k. Not really systemic fraud.  
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:25:16
Sorry but I'm out of the loop what happened? 
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:29:24
Wow.  American justice system is a massive failure to say the least 
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:33:41
All this is tru but also the judge failed to see that the "democtratic"  process used to create the drug war was biased and unjust
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:20:24
Security by obscurity is not security 
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:48:36
What I don't get is why they are requesting cash for unencrypting the files.  Most ransom ware is paid in bitcoin not cash in person that's dumb
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:10:05
Im waiting for a website to pop up not some software that you have to run. I dont get why it  cant be just like silk road.  When its accessible easily I will use it 
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:30:09
yep
