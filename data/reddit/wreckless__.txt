What are your thoughts about the $10k hits?

@_date: 2019-10-16 21:46:32
Why not jus say the rich get richer and the poor get more poor?
@_date: 2019-10-16 22:08:33
Yep.. it’s true though..  it’ll go away jus like any other empire, no empire can be sustained for so many years.. (forgot the amount years) but yea.. it’s true, but.. the poor relies on their job mostly to pay for houses and such, with no job you have nothing.. and back then everyone was getting laid off which in turn made them lose their houses, which is why the rich bought the houses and sold back to the poor for profit.. it’s just how it goes...

This you definitly need to do..
What these scammers do is.. 
1. they’ll lure you in to their site.
2. They get you to make an account with them..
3. They get you to deposit whatever amount of crypto or fiat to them..  and if you do that..
4. They then use the username and password that you used to make an account with them, and they try to use those same credentials at exchanges, wallets etc.. 
5. Then if they are successful they transfer every single cent you have to their wallet.. and when they do.. theirs nothing you can do to get it back..
So yea.. you need to change any account informations you have with any exchange(s) you use ... wallets .. bank accounts.. ANYTHING.. that you used that same information with..!!! 
Hope you don’t fall for this kind of bullshit again..

@_date: 2019-09-01 21:00:06
What would be the best BTC wallet that you would suggest? Based on customer service, TX’s, and reliability??? 
I’m needing to know this info, and figured many others could use this information as well!!
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:35:20
I use CashApp for my BTC purchases I’ve never had a problem, dunno why so many people are having trouble..  
- Connection?
- Make sure app is UTD
- Try only using Cell signal rather than WiFi,
Or vise  versa.. 
these only few thing I would think would cause trouble? But I’m no expert by any means.
@_date: 2019-09-22 14:35:23
That’s awesome!!!
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:29:10
