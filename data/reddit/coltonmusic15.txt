I mean I'm not saying I'm happy about it. Unfortunately we live in a capitalistic society that does indeed value profit/bottom line over everything else. Money is what influences and shapes our economy, politics, etc etc. I would much prefer that we live in a society where hard work/merit/strong ethics are valued more but unfortunately our society is governed by the wealthiest individuals.

I've been with my wife for 8 years now and I guess we've just hit that place where she trusts my decision making because she is aware of how much research I put into all of our financial decisions. Recently dropped my first $1500 into bitcoin and I told her my plan was to drop another $1500 into it if it drops major after the hard fork. She is on board and has shown a lot of interest in the tech. This might be the first investment I've gotten into that she has shown considerable interest in.

Why are people so certain? I've read a few people talk about how miners will opt to mine the consensus coin that the community chooses to hodl after this hard fork. Is there not much potential profit in mining the B2X if the demand is only 10% of BTC? 
I'm considering selling BTC, buying LTC, transferring to Bittrex and then buying BTC after the hard fork (hopeful for drop). Is Bittrex planning to do a freeze in transactions on BTC during this time period? Liquidity is very important to me as I want to be able to pounce on a drop in BTC. Just wondering if it will fall upon initial fork, and then fall harder when more of the masses can sell upon the unfreeze at coinbase. These hard forks are annoying af.

I bought 25. Tired of stress of trading time for the long hodl.

Yeah I've spent a considerable amount of the last 3 years studying and buying/selling in stocks and options so I'm at least comfortable with the risk/volatility of bitcoins enough not to worry about large moves in either direction. Just interested in buying and holding for the long term while I learn more about this.

I'm one of the 100k and I invested $1500. Felt like a reasonable amount of my capital to put down and as I settle in and observe/learn I'll keep buying partials until I hit a whole bitcoin. It's been an exciting day for me. Ready to become a full participant of this sub.

Does anyone plan on hodling both coins long term? Is there a possibility that both coins endure and eventually BTC will be like 100k compared to 10k for B2X? 
Just wondering.

Yeah real talk are people saying they have zero confirmations on BTC when buying with fiat? I've been able to transfer back and forth between BTC/LTC, BTC/ETH, and BTC/BCC without issue.

As much as I would like to lower my cost basis in BTC, I feel compelled to hold out and just ride the waves. I may take half of my position and liquidate right before the fork, and if it dips significantly use those funds to buy back in. I think a lot of people are trying to transition to alts but I'm not prepared with enough research to have any conviction to hold any alts during this event. I'd rather keep my funds half BTC to get both coins, and half in settled USD, ready to buy if BTC retraces. The key I think will be to also not jump the gun on buying into BTC on the drop. Slow and steady wins the race.

I dropped $1500. Will drop another $1500 if bitcoin dips hard after fork.

I finally bought my first partial bitcoin today. Got in for $1500 as a test buy been discussing it with my wife and we decided to make the plunge. Feels good to be holding on to something like bitcoin and to have a piece of one, now I just have to build up to a full coin. I did my transaction through coinbase now I'm wondering how I need to go about securing my purchase with an offline wallet. Additionally, I'm wanting to know what other alt cryptocurrencies Bitcoin holders are putting money into. Any advise?

I did all of the verification to get my limits up. Got $750 instant via credit and did the other half of the expense via bank.

I made my first buy this morning. I had read about bitcoin back in 2011 and never made any moves because I didn't have any money back then. Now I've got a steady job and I took the first plunge today. Feels great. Excited for the future.

That made me laugh and then it made me weep.
