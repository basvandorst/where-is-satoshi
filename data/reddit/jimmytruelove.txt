Funny guy.  
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:40:18
Are you stupid? You surely don't believe r bitcoin has  a combined portfolio of 17.2 billion do you?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:49:46
This is very cool
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:31:18
Remindme! 7 days what happened to this drive with BTC on it
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:12:48
But why?
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:43:10
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:39:01
You're talking a lot of horseshit.  It's funny, please carry on.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:18:42
Obnoxious comment, delete.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:32:00
I suggest you transfer it now. They've reviewed your account and decided they don't want your business.  Plenty of exchanges to choose from. Move on.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:06:28
Advert delete.
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:55:00
Yeah I'm afraid that's more than likely gone mate.
You can locate the wallet address (public) finding the private key is another matter entirely if you don't have the seed. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:40:10
Good on you! Thanks for this post :)
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:23:34
So what?
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:48:30
Wake me up when you create a successful bitcoin casino and get your coin listed on an exchange and mineable with 'Scrypt algorithms'.
How old are you? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:40:15
If coinbase were hacked I'd like to think everyone's card details are encrypted but you never know... 
I'm also with coinbase.  I have no idea in all honesty what the danger of hackers getting access to our ID and Credit card details. 
To clarify:
CoPay isn't a website it's an app you install on your phone/laptop/iPAD - or all 3
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:20:06
Can you explain in layman's terms what's wrong with CoPay?  
I have 3 wallets on their desktop and iOS client with a not small amount of BTC...
I tried reading through the link above but unfortunately I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:43:22
Enter your pass phrase into another wallet that lets you alter the tx fee?
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:41:39
How would you advise?
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:43:40
Pleasure mate! Good luck :)
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:22:17
The worry is that even with 2FA, Coinbase themselves still own / have the private key to your wallet.  They can control what happens with your bitcoin.
You want to make it so YOU have control over your bitcoin.  BYOB, be your own bank.
I highly recommend CoPay, it's the best wallet on the market imo.  
With multisig support (meaning 2FA between 2 or more of your devices is necessary for any transfers off Wallet) it's basically as secure as a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:59:58
Good luck man, be careful.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:40:02
Waste of time
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:48:32
What's this?? What CoPay malware?? I use CoPay I'm worried
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:17:27
Exactly this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:33:20
It's SEK not USD :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:20:11
Why haven’t you put every cent you own into it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:22
Out of interest why not weekly x 4?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:47
Thank you.
The percentages in green on the side, are what you speculate the value of BTC is (in USD) increasing each month?
So the first year you are anticipating only a 1.12% increase in the value of bitcoin per month?  Am I right?
Thanks again!
EDIT: wait perhaps you're saying it'll increase 12%... month on month in 2018.. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:27:32
Fucking hell
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:57:30
Maybe use another currency like GBP or EUR... typical yank :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:39:24
She’s one of the thickest celebrities of all time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:13:15
I would love a sheet like this can you share?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:28
Amazing, thank you so much! 
Sorry, forgive me for the idiotic questions.
Can you explain the Initial Hodl Value (is that how much in your home currency you have before you start depositing in 2018?)
Can you explain the Exchange rate field? What exchange rate is that between, the home currency and the BTC currency?
Thanks man!

This is clearly the result of huge sub $3000 buy orders engaging.
A mild bounce back,  I reckon it'll fall again.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:34:42
Hold on.  Bounce is rounding off I reckon.. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:52:44
Me too.. still a bounce and not a reversal imho.  If it goes past 3850 I'm back in.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:34:42

@_date: 2017-09-18 14:23:25
He's referring to the miner's block reward.
He's just being incredibly retarded in his interpretation. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:21:02
Out of interest: how much have you lost in the past 48 hours? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:58:09
You're being deliberately obtuse.  
How much has the value relative to GBP of your bitcoin holdings depreciated in the past 48 hours?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:58:23
I like your style.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:27:56
I don't think you quite understand my question.  I understand the concept of floating price to protect against the interim between placing a buy order and turning up to purchase in cash.
These people are putting a deliberately low number on their advert they never intend to honour just to get to the top of the listing. Even if you go onto localbitcoin at the time of sale and say this is the amount you're listing at even then they won't honour it and say no 5-10% above.
As per their support I just received:
No, that is not allowed. They have to honor the price of their LocalBitcoins ads. Please report those users to support who don't honor their price. They will be banned.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:26:19

This is COMPLETE bullshit.
Coinbase or any online wallet/exchange is your WORST option.
Setup a multisig wallet and/or a paper wallet and lock it in a safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:23:23
Ridiculous response.  You know what he meant by what value did bitcoin lose. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:42:16
Yeah, you really haven't got a clue what you're talking about. Quit while you're ahead.
@_date: 2017-09-18 14:12:22
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
