let that 300$ ride, and let it turn into an 10x that over time. and i agree with most, get a ledger nano s and transfer that shit over on to your ledger after the fork settles (i would leave b2x on coinbase, and then transfer BTC to ledger, of course after its safe to do so after the b2x fork). Thats my plan anyway. GL.

Coinbase is an exchange and a wallet. The difference is that theu hold your keys. You dont own your own keys when you leave you btc on an exchange like coinbase. I have a ledger nano s. Essentially you plug it in. Open the wallet on it goto chrome open the ledger wallet app on chrome and send your btc to your ledger. Once its moved over to your ledger just unplug it. You can watch videos on it or goto the ledger site on the faq page. 
Gdax just has cheaper fees then coinbase. I used gdax and coinbase. Just move your btc to your new hardware wallet and just hodl.

Many feel the way you do. I know few friends who have sold all of their btc today in hopes of a huge dip after the fork to rebuy. But me im all about hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:08:26
Exactly my thought. My wife was like sell sell sell! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:07:57
When it dips buy more! shieeeet...
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:42:19
Shiet isnt reddit a source? Haha. JUST HODL
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:46:24
After much debate im going to hodl
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:59:33
Id suggest to save up some more then buy. Before or after the fork. 10 20 bucks youll still have to pay the fee so might as well save up a bit more and just buy some then. Maybe like 100 bucks and then just hodl.
But for newbies coinbase is very easy to use. Gdax for cheaper fees

well i hear some are selling now and waiting till theres a drop in btc to buy back in, i'm wondering if i should do the same. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:37:59
Well i read that even if its on a ledger with your own keys youll get the b2x as well. But dont really know how that works.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:14:25
Segwit2x and btc splitting into 2 blockchains. If ypu want b2x coin then buy before. Price might drop after the fork so a lot of people might buy then. Just do what your gut tells you. Good luck

Ledger nano s is good too. I wouldnt avoid coinbase.. its not bad. Gdax is mot bad either. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:36:57
Doing that as i type this.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:39:28
I do all the time with my hand bro.

Ive read so much shit in the past week about btc btcash  b2x that im overwhelmed. Just gonna hodl
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:38:36
Trying to read up on it some more but theres such a vast amount information for me to read it all. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:09:34
HODL dont panic sell. Its the long game here. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:56:31
There is bitcoin.org or .com or wiki it. With diagrams so you dont get lost in the technical jargon. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:37:55
im also hearing that i should pull out now, wait for the fork, wait for the dust to settle, wait for a drop in btc, then rebuy in.
