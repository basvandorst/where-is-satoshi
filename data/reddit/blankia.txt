If I place one buy order I would prefer to pay 0.50% rounded upwards. 
If I placed three buy orders I would understand that I would have to pay for each one 0.50% rounded upwards. But I did not decide to divide the trade! I just placed one order and expect to get charged to pay for just one order. How can they think that it is oke to charge me three times?

It would be even worse if they only paid out the people with fiat money in their accounts.

I don't think Bitstamp uses this, they are lagging in the trading features.. But I just recently started trading on them. I use Kraken most of the time and just a big shout out to them. They have a good and well thought out platform to trade on.. some limitations with speed.. But on average very good and they seem to be run by honest and trustworthy people.

But for some reason this just strikes me. How can someone with a profitable business, making lots of money and doing something he likes just steal so much money and risk the jail time? He could have just sold the company for xx millions. Or even liquidate the company and have many millions left..

Well, nobody is going to deposit money on that exchange once you know that they are running a fractional reserve! Would you deposit new money when you knew that the exchange can not pay you the full amount back? No of course not, No new customers will do this. This will lead to low business on the exchange and high bid-ask spreads. Just a matter of time that the negative book-value gets bigger. 
But still heads up for them being transparent, open and honest about it.

It is more like two persons going out for dinner and one is paying the whole amount. But he is charged for twice the fee.

Yes! Indeed, This is exactly my point and everyone trading on Bitstamp should complain about this because it does not make sense and is just theft!

Trader vs long term holder,
Favourite exchange,
How many times a day do you look at bitcoin related news/websites.
Would be very much interested in geographic location.
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:39:33
Aah ok, didn't know that. It could make more sense now. So every customer on that exchange has a percentage of their balance frozen?

Maybe... You can look up the orderbook through their API. It shows some information..
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:14:23
I don´t know. Maybe people can place bid orders through their API? Sell orders are however still suspensed through their API.

Calculate the beta of the company in respect to the return of the bitcoin market. If you believe the beta in the long run is is for example 2, then the company should move twice as fast as the market. 
You can arbitrage any deviations from this calculated beta. The strategy will only work when your calculated beta will be right.

This is very nice! Bitcoin is gonna be very big in the Netherlands.

I think it will be boring. Because of the fact that there are no market orders. I think very few people will be buying or selling today. But lets see. 21 bids in the orderbook at the moment. I think they will be very loooooow.

What would happen when you accidently send money to a bitcoin adress not yet claimed by someone? Can you claim a particular adress yourself if its still available?
@_date: 2014-03-24 08:11:06
So basically if you send money to an unclaimed adress your fucked up.  Does some lucky person open a new bitcoin adress and find already a balance in there? 
Why is it possible to send money to an unclaimed adress? Is it?

What a complete bullshit if this guy did some insider trading. The surprising part must be that he still managed to fuck up while he did all this insider trading. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 07:30:13
What would happen if you write a computer program that non-stop creates bitcoin adresses, when would we run out of bitcoin adresses?

Well, if we all email him asking to remove our data, he should at least respond to 20% of us that we were in the group that has already been sold. If he always answers you are not sold yet, Then he is just making things up. Around 20 in a 100 times he should say you have already been so or not respond at all

I could care less if they rounded the total amount upwards to the nearest two decimals. But splitting the trade up into smaller ones for calculating higher fees is just nonsense and just plain theft!

I still do not agree with this partial fix of Bitstamp. If I place one order I want to be charged for just one order, regardless if it is bought into by three different orders. I decided to place one order so should be charged for just one. Bitstamp is just a scammer exchange with a bad reputation. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 08:45:35
Their gonna do AML and KYC better. How would that help giving them a competitive advantage??
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:18:23
Yes indeed, although it will take some time to find out what this company's correlation and beta is towards bitcoin.
