Finally this guy gentlemen AF. Enough of the transaction FUD please. R/BTC trolls back to your bridges. 
How hard is it to understand that fees are about the number of inputs. Combine in small amounts and use a low fee and wait until you have enough to send in larger amounts. 
Did anyone ever notice that the fees are paid in effing bitcoin? Did anyone notice that bitcoin is 16k per? Well, that's why it effing costs money to transact! God forgive me for what I'm about to say: in a parallel universe where bcash was worth 16k, and had the popularity of bitcoin, every bcash person would be complaining about the cost of a transaction just like they are today. 
Wake the F up people and stop paying attention to the damn FUD about fees. Learn and understand what you are working with please and understand how fees are determined so it isn't a shock that sending 0.01 with 300 inputs costs more than the transaction itself. Learn how to manage these things and with that knowledge it'll help you better understand when you are getting put on by enemies of financial freedom. 
I'm sorry but after years of listening to this TX BS, seeing countless concern trolling about fees, I've had enough.

This doesn't bode well. As explained by the core-devs, this 'flaw' has been known about since 2011 and wallet code is the way to work around it until it is corrected. Seeing as Mt.Gox uses custom wallet code, it's their responsibility to fix their code to account for the issue, and clearly, they didn't. When a company like that starts pointing fingers - it's a bad omen to those who have funds there. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:20:28
I'm happy to hear this. Frankly, the slower the uptake, the better off we all are for the time being. There's a reason people say patience is a virtue.

It give those of us here more time as well to put our digital currency wallets in order before the whales of wall street bust in the door.

So, you're not making accusations, but you do call what GAW is doing a Ponzi scheme. I'm still waiting for you to post your factual findings on the matter. 
I get that the Hashlet thing is a little hard to grasp, but here's my take. Hashlets are 1MH shares of larger rigs. Period, end of story... they don't exist physically other than as small outputs from rigs they power and maintain - this is exactly what GHash.io does and has done for over a year now, but GAW is doing it with scrypt. They have 750MH rigs that they bought at less than $1/MH and are reselling the hashes at $16 per. At that markup, they can do just about anything with that $15+ including, but not limited to, maintaining their own in-house pool that pays out 2x what other pools can manage (using the 1600% profit they made initially to support the payouts) - nearly indefinitely, with, or without an influx of new BTC - because the fees they collect on the Hashlets also go back into the price support on the poolside (ZenPool). I don't have specific inside knowledge of this, mind you, but I think it's clear that the business model is sustainable for the foreseeable future and as some have mentioned here, you do, as a share/Hashlet owner get out of it more than you put into it over a 45-90 day period... unlike GHash.io. 
So, is it a Ponzi scheme? Well, if it can run on it's own merits without continuing influx of new investors to pay old investors, it really isn't. Frankly, financially speaking, it's a pretty brilliant business mechanism for those who take advantage of it. The cost of entry is very low - the cost of ownership is manageable, and if there's no erosion of the original investment cost over time through discounting or trading, it's sustainable. Time will tell of course how it plays out, but for the time being, it looks like a nicely executed business plan.

What's interesting to me is that bitcoin people are taking something created to revolutionize and democratize wealth and turning it into 'old money' 2.0. They want the Wall Street assholes to legitimize their new wealth so they can feel safely monied. I'm pretty sure that wasn't the intention of Satoshi.
There's room in everyone's wallet for more than Bitcoins. I know I take my big boy money to the car dealership, but my pocket change for many other things... 
Arguing about all of this is pretty pointless - as many others have pointed out, what benefits one, benefits us all. Elitism has no place in crypto so you folks snubbing the shibe need to take a long hard look in the mirror - are you becoming what you hate about our financial establishment? Embrace variety and let the tech take it's course - the fittest will survive and thrive even in the digital world.

@_date: 2014-01-06 21:42:51
Here's my take... since bitcoin is open source, and anyone is free to develop the code further, the existing financial institutions see value in leveraging the bitcoin processing power to move their own money from place to place, and build their own UX/UI on top of it for branding purposes. Big Finance co-opting our network and our miners to continue filling their pockets. We may need to build an sieve to prevent their transactions from piggy-backing on our work. What coule be better than a free network they can use, with free processing power, moving their transactions around?

Rule 0 in crypto - don't buy mining gear with bitcoin... unless there is an excellent chance that you'll have more bitcoin in your wallet than you spent in 60 days or less. 
Now, if you are selling KH for USD, I'm certainly willing to see what kind of return I can make.

Here's something we're all missing. Nothing in crypto is written in stone. There are no 'chosen' in this world - only what is accepted and what people put their faith in, just like any other payment method or commodity... and to flesh this out a little more, nothing is stopping the shibe devs from deciding at any point that they've had their fun, and are going to go for mainstream acceptance - renaming their product and re-branding it into something that compounds their acceptance and stature - and then, who knows what will happen to the 'first mover', bitcoin? It gets overtaken by a digital vehicle that truly moves like a currency rather than masquerades as one like bitcoin. Frankly, every coin at this point is in the game, and it's only a matter of time and further development of each coin platform that will decide what gets used for what purpose(s). Value takes many, many forms in the non-digital world, why would we think it very much different in the internet 'world of things'? Think big and think far ahead guys. Don't limit your imagination.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:31:37
I suspect that to be the case. They didn't correct the issue in 2011, and someone exploited it... and now they can't account for losses (and inability to cover same). Maybe they have the addresses used to double transact and are keeping it quiet for the investigation to result in a person of interest... this is certainly not a reprieve for Mt.Gox, but at least it makes some sense. Either way, there are going to be some very, very unhappy people as all of this unravels and it's exposed that a major theft occurred because of Mt.Gox's poor controls.

Just a thought - you're a business, not an exchange. You should state (a pop up during checkout) that the customers paying in BTC understand that because of the volatility of BTC, there are no refunds given or allowed for that payment type. If they want to avail themselves of a money-back-guarantee, they must pay with USD and allow them to change their payment type at checkout. It's really that simple. Buyer's remorse can be a real bitch when you think you are paying for a $20 a month service, only to find out a week later that the cheap hosting you bought is really costing you now $40 a month. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:11:06
Can't disagree, but if the Government decides there's nowhere for the mining farms to immediately realize their gross returns, it becomes unprofitable very quickly.
