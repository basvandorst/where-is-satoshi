This is exactly what I wanted to be asked. Now I'll have to teach myself how cryptokitties work. I'll spend today researching and add it too my list.
I'm incredibly interested in the treatment of the Dodger tokens at the moment, early thoughts are that it is a "collectable" but unsure as to if that is too aggressive in the ATOs eyes. So I have a couple dodger tokens in the post on the way over to me so I can study them a little more.
From ATO website
"You disregard any capital gain or loss you make from a collectable if any of the following apply:
you acquired the collectable for $500 or less"
This assumes you are not "in the business" of trading tokens, and we are only talking capital gains.

All you should be doing is comparing the lowest fee between exchanges available.
You can get BTCmarkets to be a 20k withdrawal limit per day relatively easy for low fee.
The exchange rate you get on LROS is terrible and the only reason to use it is if you are trying to evade paying tax on little amounts. For any significant amounts you would be getting a terrible exchange rate and still remain high risk for audit and paying tax anyway which will end up with you being worse off.
Best bet is to use something like btc markets, withdrawing the max daily amount.

Straight from ato website.
"Transacting with cryptocurrency
A CGT event occurs when you dispose of your cryptocurrency. A disposal can occur when you:
use cryptocurrency to obtain goods or services"
LROS sell price right now = $8268.10
Btc markets right now = $8797.01
Not saying btc markets is the best. Just saying you should add to list of the exchanges you look at for the lowest fee

Oh boy, honestly.. the ato have really stuffed this one up.
Really we must wait until somebody tries to push the boundaries and we start to see specific tax rulings. Crypto is super new so the guidance given is minimal and the waters haven't really been tested yet. The ATO notes that are released do say if you give it a go they will be forgiving and they wont be penalising people. This i would assume means that as long as you arn't intentionally trying to hide your gains from the ATO then you should be alright.
Originally the ATO wording was along the lines of (paraphrasing) "if you purchased crypto for less than $10,000, then all capital gains for personal use are exempt". Then crypto went up x1000 and the ATO quickly backtracked because anyone with $5,000 for a cost base was sitting on $5,000,000 which could have been classified as exempt. not a chance.
 This is what is probably causing the most confusion, as everyone is trying to fall under this category however the wording has been cleared up a fair bit and people just don't want to read it because it unfortunately does not tell them what they want to hear. 
The way i read the current wording is that you wouldn't have a problem with smaller items, even a $270 concert ticket i'd be happy to argue is personal use, but if you are trying to claim that a $9,999 used car was purchased with crypto that you have a x100 gain on &amp; have been holding for 2 years, you may have an issue with how aggressive you are being.
ATO wording - 
" The longer the period of time that a cryptocurrency is held, the less likely it is that it will be a personal use asset. "
" Cryptocurrency may be a personal use asset if it is kept or used mainly to purchase items for personal use or consumption. Only capital gains you make from personal use assets acquired for less than $10,000 are disregarded for CGT purposes. However, all capital losses you make on personal use assets are disregarded."
" **Example -** Michael wants to attend a concert. The concert provider offers discounted ticket prices for payments made in cryptocurrency. Michael pays $270 to acquire cryptocurrency and uses the cryptocurrency to pay for the tickets on the same day. Having regard to the circumstances in which Michael **acquired** and **used** the cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency is a personal use asset."

Even if its not a reprint, just assumed someone would have a super great quality photocopy that could be printed to A3 and framed.
@_date: 2019-09-22 05:24:39
Sorry just to clarify. I'm not looking for an original copy. Kind of assumed that would never be achievable. Just want a good copy I can blow up and put on a poster.

If you are an australian citizen for tax purposes (note this definition is different to just being an australian resident) you are required to report CGT on assets anywhere in the world.
However, if you are required to pay CGT on this disposal for the other country, (say USA) there are currently foreign tax offset rules with a handful of countries (USA includes) which would mean you are only paying tax once.
Simply put, If the other countries tax rate is more favourable you would pay at the ATOs rate
If the other countries tax rate is less favourable you would pay at their rate and no additional tax would be payable in australia.

Retrospectively. Where the ATO believe there has been fraud or evasion there is no time limits to when they can audit &amp; amend an assessment. 
It is a requirement before an exchange allows you to register that you identify yourself, many icos now have mandatory KYCs, and all banks under current federal legislation are required to report transactions over 10k to AUSTRAC
I find it hard to believe that the ATO wont be able to at least know you were involved in the space, and from there they will just ask the question.

Based on the current ATO interpretation, in this scenario, trading ETH for ALT would trigger a CGT event, as would trading back ALT to ETH.
That is *two* seperate CGT events.
The only positive side here being if one is a gain and one is a loss, the loss can be offset against the gain if it was made in the same financial year.
