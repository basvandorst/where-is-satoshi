It COULD hit $10,000,000 aswell

You need to invest tens of thousands of dollars for it to be profitable, I wouldn't even consider it if I were you

Fuck off

Nah I was meant to buy ETH to put onto Binance to buy some Alt coins. But accidently bought BTC instead
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:54:07
Fuck off

From what I understand, the higher fee you have the quicker it confirms though right? So this will just take days, or weeks to actually get out of no-mans land?

Compound interest my friend. Compound :)

With a balance that small where $12 is a big chunck of what you have, leaving it on an exchange should be fine.

Ohkay thank you! It's good to hear I haven't lost it for the foreseeable future!
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:34:12
Yes you should report it. And you will be taxed like you do any type of income 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:50:37
If you don’t have an income, it’s not worth the risk. You know that the money in the bank is gonna be there in a week. Bitcoin could crash in that time and then you’re left with no money.
Ultimately it’s your decision if you think the risk is worth it, but you need to be prepared to lose any money you invest 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:50:32
I mean... It's common knowledge is it not?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:22:00
At this rate, wait 1 hour
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:08:53
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:49:30
Okay yeah that's true. I think it crossed my mind for a second but completely forgot about it since it was my first accidental buy and was too focused on those fees. But everything should be good now. Ill remember that for next time
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:48:02
Oh okay so I can expect to see my Bitcoin on my Binance account shortly then?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:30:28
Thats the thing though... So many new people who come in think there are ways of predicting the market. It's like "Gamblers Fallacy" Where they believe if something happens like this or at this time, it'll earn them money.
Getting them to understand there's no way to predict is important
