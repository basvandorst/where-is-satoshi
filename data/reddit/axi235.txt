He can give you any address ..You have no way to verify the information and he has no way to prove anything, assuming he lost access to his (unencrypted) private key. Or do I miss something?

could you PN me this proof? I already send you multiple messages, but did not get an answer (yet)...

A few questions for the other brute-forcers:
* How many passwords can you check per second per core?
* Is anybody using a GPU cracker?
* How many hashes can you check with your setup
* How many passwords have you already checked?
For me its 2-6 PW/s per core depending on the CPU, I have no GPU implementation, I can check several hundred pw/s (when using all machines) and I checked already several hundred millions in total.
How about you?

Thanks, you too! 
With hashcat you can try how your GPU performs with scrypt, but I guess also a 1080 won't help much.

I generated mutliple passwordlists based on different regex strings, using only selected fragments. So I cannot really state which combinations I have already checked (also its still running). I just made sure that there are no duplicates in the different lists. 
Regarding GPU, I tried it and gave up, as the scrypt alone was so slow that it makes no sense. Disclaimer: I'm a GPU beginner, so maybe it did something wrong...
I got 12H/s with parameters 16384,8,8 and 800kH/s with 1024,8,1. Would be interested if anybody managed to  get a good perfomance boost from using GPUs...

Yes I think so too :/
