My bet is Mega. Mycelium show you a PDF of a recovery key to write down and keep, pen and paper is good here. If you typed this code into a computer you are immediately at risk. Then sending this code to Mega relying on the browser or the Mega plug in to encrypt it is far too risky. I'm not blameing Mega here, it's a good storage system but cannot protect such valuable data.
Not setting a PIN on your Mycelium wallet was foolish, you couldn't have read the simple instructions provided with the wallet to have missed this important step. It's good to hear Mycelium are investigating as it shows they are supporting their app.
One other suggestion is the phone keyboard you're using. I like some of the fancy Android keyboards you can get but who knows the security risk they present. I'm sticking to the Google standard keyboard as the safest option.
Lastly, thanks for sharing your experience here as it's the best way to secure Bitcoin wallets into the future.

Fine as long as you remember the inputs you used in years time. Also good luck doing that in a shop while queuing to pay with Bitcoin.

Yesterday I received two transactions of one Satoshi each, from, who knows? I just went to look if they are confirmed but the Android App isn't accepting my PIN. I hope this is the reason I can't log in and nothing more sinister. Its just pocket change, I don't keep much in online wallets.

I can't understand what's going on but I'm concerned as I use TrueCrypt, have done for years now.

Doing nothing like rabbit in the headlights of QE, is not a safe option.

I think you were lucky you didn't get as far as putting any money into it.

You should get off that fence of yours, saying you don't want risk then admitting investing in 401k. Your government has their sticky fingers all over that investment. For 40 years I had the benefit of a government pension fund linked to RPI inflation protection just to have that protection snatched away in my 1st year of retirement. Your getting from others here all the best advice available but you can't see it. LocalBitcoins, paper wallets, affordable sized purchases hey spend $100 and start learning for yourself.

You will probably find this old post of mine helpful. I think it gives a solution to all your doubts about paper wallets using PIP38.

I had trouble using the Blockchain.info Android wallet where I kept getting an error "insufficient funds" when I had substantially more than I was trying to send. I emailed them a full description of the problem on the 22nd March but they didn't reply. 
I since moved to the Mycelium wallet which seems to work perfectly so I haven't needed to contact them for support. My impression is that Blockchain.info provide a great service but their user support is flaky especially since they had all those database errors.

You weren't being irresponsible as Mycelium wallet is considered to be very secure. I use mycelium, small amounts in the hot wallet, larger amounts on BIP38 paper with the watch address feature in Mycelium. My bet is the attack came via Mega I certainly wouldn't put any financial information on Mega. That said, the only thing stopping sending coins from the Mycelium hot wallet is the six digit PIN. This is a mystery that's important to solve.

This is a very disturbing situation.

I've long been using an exchange service like this called Currency Fair, their very good. I have asked them a couple of times now to include Bitcoin in their list of currencies. They say that they are considering it.

Don't go against your parents wishes, it's not worth the risk. You can still try out Bitcoin using Testnet and a Mycelium Wallet on an Android phone. There is a version of Bitcoin Core for Testnet, it doesn't take long to download the Testnet Blockchain. Then you can mine your own coins or get them free from a Testnet coin faucet. You can even make Testnet paper wallets all for free and at no risk.

I don't scan the QR code but always opt to enter the code manually into Google Authenticator. Save the code in Lastpass or something and you can always restore Authenticator by re-entering the codes. Maybe best to not 2fa Lastpass though, could be cutting off the branch you're sitting on. ;-)

Yes, then install a wallet with a couple of Bitcoin in it and if the coins are still there a week later your probably in the clear. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:42:22
Thanks for that, I tried an hour later and the PIN works now with all funds intact. The two transactions have zero confirmations.

They just need a limit above which they ask for verification. Perhaps they don't want small trades.

Great, what this guy is doing for Bitcoin is worth a 1000 price speculators. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:01:37
On that basis you should be using MtGox, they have been around the longest. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:43:40
I'm really concerned that date / place of birth, full address and all the details contained enable telephone verification and postal applications perhaps with some further research. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:50:33
Exactly, "Shutup Slave"
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:45:09
Good tip, that's exactly what I'm doing but it's a bit more expensive. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:48:27
As an EU citizen, think you're underestimating the risk or more likely the devastating consequences should it happen to you. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:58:00
I played that remark! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:54:47
I'm amazed so many are accepting this risk, if nobody caved in and conformed to Bitstamp they would have to provide an acceptable alternative or go out of business. 
If the unthinkable happened, imagine how dumb you'd feel explaining to the police that you sent all such details on the internet to a site in Slovenia. You're so trusting.

I'm using LocalBitcoins, I just want small amounts for spending, spending is key to the future of Bitcoin. Who is going to bother laundering a couple of hundred pounds?
