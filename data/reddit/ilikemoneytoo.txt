Wow ok genius, lets put you there and see how you do with changing the government.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:23:14
Sure, and what have you personally done that's achieved that, so that you can shit on the current generation of another nation as soon as someone points out they're better at something than you?

It's not only that they're dirt cheap, they're entirely covered by bitstamp. If you're transferring out 1BTC, that's how much you'll get, not 0,999.
Plus just the fact that they batch and use segwit means they're less of a burden on the blockchain.

I agree with the Monero thing because it is safer to be fair, but someone you pay with Bitcoin doesn't necessarily know how much you have. You paid them from one or more of your addresses, but not all of them. If you broke apart your huge amount into many addresses using a tumbler or something like that, you can keep spending while exposing only a small part of your total funds to specific people you send to / receive from.

So what's the conversion fee like, and do people have to submit to KYC checks?

If it went high enough for me to buy an apartment with half my holdings, I'd pull the trigger on a sale then. Before that, it's not worth selling as nothing in my life would change, and I'd just be sad if it kept going much higher.
EDIT: And I can't imagine myself ever selling everything.

From his description the greater threat is someone physically getting the private keys from him under threat of violence, so holding the seed words in a bank makes more sense. The risk is much bigger than some hypothetical scenario with govt surveillance etc.

You don't have to be an asshole. You can provide your explanation without the toxic, condescending bullshit.
This sub sometimes seems like it's just chock full of rude teenagers.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:44:37
Sure, but I primarily use this sub so that's the sub I want to be up to par. Just because there's this weird pathetic war between holders of tiny fractions of bitcoin and holders of tiny fractions of bitcoin cash, shouldn't have to mean this sub degrades into a shitfest. It's already too filled with memes and bullshit instead of technical discussion.
90% of threads here are crap and I'm much better served just hanging out in the bitcoin core slack.
It'd be nice if both this sub and are more civilized, but I'm primarily interested in this one, since I'm not interested in bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-03-26 14:09:27
Sure, I just wanted to prevent anyone from anyone from getting the wrong idea about how fees aka transaction sizes work when it comes to segwit.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:01:59
Why not transfer bitcoin to a more stable exchange like coinbase and withdraw fiat from there?
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:05:05
What if the money does not come? How do you convince bisq to give your coins back?
@_date: 2018-03-02 08:57:27
Lightning nodes do, though.
@_date: 2018-03-25 20:14:30
If anyone has another idea nobody's stopping them from attempting to implement it. Noone can forbid you from building an alternate second, third, fourth etc. layer on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:09:53
Thank you for the info!
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:09:18
I'm still on the fence but I can see your point, seeing how miners would collect block reward even if no one transacted bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:26:01
Address type of the recipient is unimportant
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:25:38
Slightly misleading as you don't have to have a channel with every person you transact with.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:44:16
I agree that it reduces over time with halvings(and will reduce much faster per tx when/if LN gets more adoption), but I think it's interesting that right now every transaction costs an additional $20 which are paid by all holders as inflation.
But yeah, I don't see what Coinbase has to do with anyhting.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:45:49
The price is wild only because it's still early days for bitcoin when it comes to adoption(currency use, not exchange trading). If one day Bitcoin would be a mainstream currency, it'd likely increase up to 3% per year, depending on global GDP growth.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:09:32
My mistake, didn't know that.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:21:32
Mining causes inflation so they are. That's why price increases after halvings.

I'd think it was *very clear* that the point is to choose an investment you think has a good chance, but seeing how nothing is certain you shouldn't take out a fucking loan or invest your entire savings.
Invest what you're willing to lose is very valid advice that'll help any investor to hold on to his investment long term, without getting him in financial trouble as soon as a single thing goes wrong, or suck out his fucking peace of mind because his life depends on the investment.

Only with bitcoin there isnt an oppressive government having control of you.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:22:15
Way to miss the point of a currency...
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:11:29
Granted but we dont know if they might put 1% into btc. They would already be safe just with that.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:03:09
If the usd was worth nothing Apple still would not be worth 0 btc. Apple is worth something because it has infrastructure, people, knowledge, a brand etc. You might accidentally be right with your claim btc won't replace everything, but if you are right, you are right by accident because this post proves you don't know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-12-15 12:02:47
What would they take? Stealing 10 or better yet a  100 or 1000 bitcoin is more flexible and less traceable than a car, jewelry etc. It's not as if they can make him make a bank transfer and get away with it...
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:38:28
I never said hacked, you simpleton. If you read my response, I was specifically referring to people who doxx themselves through comments and then get robbed in the actual physical world.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:38:18
No, they're going to non-magically search for people saying they have lots of BTC, then find out who they are and use the $5 wrench approach to get them to hand over their coins.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:26:23
Considering the quality of your responses, clearly you've already lost something - your wits.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:52:45
Even if it's a 1% or 0.5% chance of happening, it's best not to publicize it if you have enough worth stealing (or think that it will be worth stealing in the future). You gain nothing and can lose a lot.
