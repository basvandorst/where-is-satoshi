Then you would need a vpn in said state and I'm sure they would notice once the zipzap payment comes from another state.  Not to mention you're an adult, their ID verification quiz knows everything about you.

Less teenagers... Apologies to the mature ones that can express thoughts without memes.

I can replace "bitcoin" in that statement with pretty much anything. 


I can say this before anything and it makes me sound like an expert.
This whole article has this butt hurt, spiteful vibe to it. 
They should stick to blabbing on about fema camps.

Thanks for the link. Why isn't it on their site? Everything else after that reads like an advertisement and is off topic. Everyone here knows how Bitinstant is *supposed* to work.

I haven't synced in a year. This week, It took about two days. Make sure your hard drives / system doesn't go to sleep.  My bitcoin-qt directory is over 5 gigs now.

I know you told me to sell your shares before the stock tanked, but DDOS and etrade's site only has one server running off a Raspberry PI...

I would think 6pm is after business hours, even if the bank was opened. Maybe they'll show up Monday? Did you deposit the *exact* amount Bitfloor told you to? 
Edit: Also I'm not sure it matters, but Local till is based in NY so it was 7pm when they received it.

Any Bank of Americas your way?

Man, they named a roommate even I forgot about. Basically Bitinstant knew who I was sleeping with in 2001.

Fucking YouTube music videos in this sub now?

Come on Guys! MTgox is the best! So honest! They didn't have to give my coins back when they got hacked the first time. They earned their 80% of Bitcoin transactions. /S

So Wells Fargo customers didn't have access to their money?  Oh man. That's devastating.  I'm surprised I haven't heard ~~more~~ any stories of people stuck on grocery store lines, people's cars stalling at gas stations because their atm cards didn't work.  Sounds like that Die Hard movie with the fire sale.  Not being able to buy something on Amazon or check your Wells Fargo balance is **a lot** different then having your assets temporally untouchable.
