mimble wimble fork or sidechain for btc is just around the corner. so disk space wont be problem
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:09:02
if you wanna receive bitcoin from 10 diff people u can give 10 diff rec key.  10 people will know only amount they sent. or amount sent on that key.
xpub one can know total amount of btc u got from all the 10 people. 
after receiving if you wanna sent all amount to one person. first wallet will sent all to the one address than it will sent to other person resulting in 11 transactions although what visible is 1 transaction and hence u might be charged high fee. fees are charged based on size.   
eg sending 10 btc which u got from 10 diff people might end up more fees than sending 100 btc got from single

I don't agree with you. apple has highest liquid cash for R&amp;D. 
apple may launch some more privacy focused, blockchain based os. 
apple is unpredictable. 
I believe we will see decentralised blockchain based phone min after 10 years
10 years from now phone manufacturers may sell hardware without OS pre installed only if Gov permits it.  apple don't care about selling to masses.  
samsung can compete with apple but it needs to bring alternative to google play.
@_date: 2019-05-15 02:02:37
both are different. 
pubx is like destination. you dont need to share it.
recev public key is like route. everytime u choose diff route so now one knows where u go

receive public key which we send to get each transaction will change.
and their be a Xpub which is your main public key. if one gets that, one can view your balance.

am from India. here if found dealing with bitcoin banks closes accounts. no more banking facilities for anyone dealing in bitcoin. it has not yet in media yet but cracking down and punishing bitcoiners began since 2 years

don’t worry transaction are all time high. in past I got payment 2,3 days latter during bull run
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:59:45
Gov is reducing cash. one has to buy bitcoin with cash. I believe withing 10 years Indian will go 100% digital cashless economy. gov have reason blaming pakistani terrorist organisation printing Fake currency. eg yesterday pakistani muslims from nepal caught with fake Indin currency by nepal police. Porn is Ban. slowly gov trying control Internet.  we got no options. opposition parties are even worst. half of them are hardcore communist.
@_date: 2019-05-05 18:59:41
why not?? creating Bitcoin cost electricity. 
creating FIAT doesn’t cost anything.

It would be better download full node. prune and delete after safe keeping keys
@_date: 2019-05-06 13:16:21
way I see money is Technology used for transferring good and service.  
if their is war and ones country takes over another country, millions are worthless if your country looses. or if GOV goes venezuela way.
I like bitcoin because of proof of work algorithm.
limited supply.

one seed one account
if you saw new seed that diff accounts.
I got your problem. their is little hope to get funds back. tell me what wallet you using
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:45:54
It is possible if exchanges are selling BTC with FIAT assuming all people wont withdraw and some will loose money while trading and at the same time getting hacked and btc stolen from cold wallet. if no bitcoin is hacked than what you saying is not possible.

eventually they will come up with some theory

whatever happens will happen for good. if world adopts crypto replacing Fiat it will kill socialims, communalism, capitalist cronies. only Free market anarchism will prevail

I got bachelor in economics. 
I own western union, money gram franchise. 
I do currency exchange. 
I agree crypto is Diff compared to gold. 
I stay in India. Here all the gov compete with each other. if Mr Modi looses elections India can be venezuela 2.0 
For us Crypto is better than Fiat. suddenly at 8 Pm primiminister announces 500 inr 1000 inr notes invalid.

POS is doomed to fail. 
5 years from now Iphone might come with100 to  1000 TB memory.
I thought lot about it. may be some better algorithm related to POS might come and then I might change my mind. but I don’t think that anything can replace POW
@_date: 2019-05-03 07:01:20
much appreciated. I was being lazy. now today itself will run full node.

most of Fist is online 1&amp;0. big banks don’t use cash to give loan.  countries don’t buy oil with cash. majority of Fiat is devalued without printing paper.

@_date: 2019-05-08 01:49:10
sometimes your wallet provider might upgrading or fixing bug that too may delay transaction display. sometimes wallet apps don’t connect. 
eg blockchain wallet for ios is too slow and android is always buggy. it takes time. check on blockchain.info about transaction details
@_date: 2019-05-05 08:36:43
and what dies FIAT paper currency called USD produce?? Is it Backed by GOLD??
atleast BITCOIN is backed by Hashrate and electricity
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:37:31
yup this people will keep innovating and sell the fear and gov wanna buy bigger and better war toys.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:41:35
I have seen all. most of making fun of apple.
@_date: 2019-05-08 01:31:36

@_date: 2019-05-27 09:47:19
what  to do with bitcoin???
@_date: 2019-05-02 08:37:43
yup. I know. apple is closed system. but apple doesn’t shy changing rules. android is trying to copy apple. canada, australi, EU are making tuff rules, taking away Privacy of citizen. so just as one can install windows, linux VM.  apple iphone may allow virtual android or linux based ox.
