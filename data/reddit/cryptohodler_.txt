That is a fallacy statement. People who use substances can be smarter than those who don't. Let us not take the government route here!
Not that I'm taking anything away from the context of your post. Good job on reverse  searching that original image.

I feel bad reading your post. I doubt you may want to trade again but if you do feel free to have a with me on trading and risk management. 
For me, I always try to look as my entries, exits and stops in a more objective rather than subjective manner so I lock my hands up from recklessness.
Anyway I'm sure the value of those 200 BTC will be more than the value of when your purchased 600 coins.

This shows that,
1. Fiat Money that enters the crypto space doesn't get liquidated back to cash.
2.Money rolled into the Altcoin space is sole used to gain more Bitcoin as smart traders take their profits in Bitcoin when the time is right.

So you can basically buy Bitcoin &amp; Shitcoins.

I honestly don't see the second one happening because I believe Satoshi doesn't care for Fiat.
To avoid mining centralization, there will come a time where most if not all hodlers will mine to maintain the network and collect transaction fees as a reward.

Does Betking allow you to deposit &amp; withdraw in bitcoin?

If you value your wealth in the amount of BTC/mBTC you hodl, the short term price in fiat shouldn't bother you at all.
I remember a friend wanting to get into Bitcoin when it corrected from ~$1150 to ~$950. He said he'll get into it if it dips below $800. Next thing he knows Bitcoin is trading at +$2000.
A couple of days ago when bitcoin was trading at $3500, he told me he will buy it if it crashes. He used the word crash instead of dip ಠ_ಠ
The next thing he know, it's +$4000. That same guy rants about what FX is so saturated and now he's trading IPO with 10X margin (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
I gave him 10mBTC last year when bitcoin was trading at around $600. How much did he invest after that? None
Don't be that guy. Don't be a hard head with weak balls. 
Take it slow but take it. Take it on a regular basis. If the price goes up you gain more fiat. If the price goes down you gain cheaper coins.

Most traders/users only sell Bitcoin and hold fiat on their exchange to buy them back cheap. The chances of the entire amount been withdrawn to a bank are really slim as it sits there doing nothing and let's not forget taxation. 
The same fiat value bounces to and fro on an exchange with the bitcoin hodling value either growing or shrinking based on targets and stop loss.

And what about bitcoin withdrawals?
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:45:17
Bitcoin can be used like currency, traded like stock &amp; be a store of value like gold.
We HODL to provide support to people from corrupt governments who in time force hyper inflation upon its people. 
We HODL because each on of us can support the other and together grow in prosperity.

To be strong in '17, we had to overcome '13.
Failure is just one of the paths to success.

Oh we hodlers members it all.

u/theymos, can you please sticky this.

That is what 99% of white papers promised. Proper legit.

* $0.1 vs **$10,000,000**
* $1 vs **$1,000,000**
* $10 vs **$100,000**
* $100 vs $10,000
* $1000
I'll hodl irrespective of which side the price is because I value my wealth in BTC
