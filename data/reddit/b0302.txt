It really is! The internet is also a revolutionary means of sharing information. People in third world countries are getting internet and they could have been changing their lives if they used it to learn... but guess what many people actually use the internet for? Facebook Memes!! *faceplam*
I know this from personal experience. I have relatives in a super poor village in Mexico who recently got internet access and instead of using it to learn something that could help them get out of poverty, they are using it to share memes on Facebook and gossip via WhatsApp. It's like they don't realize they have the greatest equalizer when it comes to access to knowledge!!

This guy is a joke. I can't take you seriously if you cite him at all.  It's like Trump citing Fox News.

You guys do know that the owner of CNBC (or someone at the top of the corporate ladder over there) has invested in bitcoin, which is why they have positive coverage of bitcoin all the time. It's not that they actually believe in bitcoin, they just want to make money.

So the issue we had with high fees will only get worst? Doesn't sound like a good future awaits Bitcoin. Miners will be incentivized to have high fees to make money they aren't getting any more with new bitcoin. 
Edit: Why not explain why I'm wrong (if I am) instead of voting me down?

I feel like anything related to the internet tends to have exponential growth. I mean think about, stock trading is unavailable on the weekends and holidays! Bitcoin trading in available 24/7. Using brick and mortar banks is limited to certain hours (ATMs have limits), but online banking is available 24/7.
So while I'm not saying that bitcoin's exponential growth is sustainable, it seems to follow a trend that internet related things grow super fast due to its 24/7 availability from any place (that has an internet connection ;).

Yep, the only thing people care about is how much money they can make with bitcoin.

So? "Leaders" can be replaced. At this point, there is nothing special about Bitcoin to remain a leader forever.

You do realize the car and Photoshop actually replaced those older technologies, right? We built cities (heck, our entire civilization) around the car and use Photoshop for basically anything now a days. Instead of bitcoin changing the financial system like the car and Photoshop changed their respective industries, bitcoin has been absorbed and doesn’t seem like it will really change much. 
Crypto currencies (something other than bitcoin) will change how money works. The more likely scenario is that the government will create its own crypto currency and money will be more digital. But bitcoin does not seem poised at this point to be anything more than speculation. The change it can do is less and less as things like this investment index happen because it’s clearly an investment and not a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:50:12
You do realize bitcoin is not special, right? It’s not that “rare” since it can easily be supplanted by any other currency (even if we limit it to only those with a cap like Bitcoin).

The trezor is much better in my opinion. I have both a trezor and a ledger nano s, but the trezor has a much more user friendly interface.

You need to chill. I had no idea this was a thing, so I decided to upload it to spread awareness. Bitcoin is still relatively new to most people and scams via texts are not exactly as commonplace as scams via emails.

Considering how the scaling debate is going, yep. I'm honestly losing faith in Bitcoin considering how something as simple as the scaling debate is awash with greedy interests and politics.
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:48:23
I just have one question to the deflation aspect of bitcoin: isn't it unfair to people who buy bitcoin later down the road? Those who got some bitcoin early on reap the benefits without doing much. Yes, they risked their fiat money, but did they really risk that much when they spent $2500 for one bitcoin that is now (in the future) worth $1,000,000?

This is from their website. SatoshiLabs is the company that owns/makes Trezor products.
"What happens if the SatoshiLabs shuts down?
There are no such plans because we love bitcoin, but even if we had to close down, there’s nothing to worry about. You can use your TREZOR together with other BIP32, BIP39 and BIP44 compatible wallets. Since our code is opensource, developers from around the world can maintain it and add new functionalities."

Not good.. I woke up to it having recover a bit since yesterday (it was about $2,500) and now it's about $2,150!!
If you truly believe in Bitcoin and you ONLY invested what you were willing to lose and afford to lose, then just hodl! Stop checking the price if it's making you feel uneasy. It'll go up again. When, who knows. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:01:16
This is great! Thanks :D

You are not participating in the confirmation bias a lot of people have around here. By questioning bitcoin's future status as a global currency, you are committing an act of heresy.

That's because the writer of the article probably has a few dollars invested in Ethereum and Dash. He definitely has money invested in Bitcoin (he has said so in previous articles), so take this analysis with a grain of salt.

Maybe the author meant legal in the sense that Bitcoin is recognized as legal tender/money?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:33:01
It sucks, but you need to think long term! Sooner or later it will be at a higher price than what you bought it for.

You have the chart tell you the price in the last day. The 2,900 price is the latest price (probably within the last few 30 minutes or less). If you had the chart show you the price in the past hour, you'd see that the chart shows the price leading up to 2,900. If you keep it as showing the price for the last day, just wait a few hours and you'll see how the price went up to 2,900.

Seriously though, what do you think of the scaling debate? It can only go unresolved for so long before it has a detrimental effect on the adoption and price of Bitcoin.

Yes, the seed words are only displayed on the Trezor screen and I have to type them in on my computer, which is why I'm wondering if it's safe to keep using the same recovery seed since someone could have seen the words I typed in. Technically, they need access to my device though since the recovery seed by itself is basically useless, right?

The only difference is that the government can't bail you out via the banks when you mess up. All rich people are capable for making mistakes or simply overspending and can lose that elite status quite easily. But I totally agree with your point.
