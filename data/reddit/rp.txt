Transaction volume is at the lowest point in over a month, but it's not the only factor.

If you're concerned about security, just stick with a hardware or paper wallet. If your private key isn't stored on some web server or on your computer, it's basically impossible to compromise.

The obvious strategy is to buy enough bitcoin to raise the price, short (bet on a low price), and then sell bitcoin to lower the price when futures are closing. Harder to do it the other way around.

There's no good way to short the market. Futures let you predict the price of bitcoin on a certain date and time and bitcoin is too volatile for that to be anything but a guess (unless you're a big enough fish to try and market manipulate). Your best option if you believe that a crash is going to happen is to just pull out your money and wait until it hits your target entry point.

Crypto in general operates as a pyramid scheme in the short term. Get more money involved in the space and your own investment goes up. The people screaming HODL here aren't actually planning on holding their bitcoin for very long, or they wouldn't care what other people are doing now.

It'll increase volatility, it could be good or bad, but it's definitely not staying anywhere near the same price.

It doesn't create a bottom at all- miners just operate at a loss until the difficulty adjustment happens or transaction confirmation slows.

People with lots of money, large cities, and other entities with billions in cash will often use traditional banks to hold their money.

There are enough warning signs to worry that it's not backed. There's a risk that any exchange carrying it could be insolvent.

I think we'll continue to see lower floors. $7k is still above the last floor, though.

It was lower than that two weeks ago. Seems pretty likely it'll drop at least that low again.

It's probably not an individual, but it could easily be a large hedge fund deciding to be 0.5-1% managed in bitcoin.

Any recession in the US would almost certainly be global at this point.

Basically the exact same things that should keep you off of any exchange that trades tether right now.

The intelligent decision is to tell others to buy so your investment goes up
