Bought at the last dip @ 10k, think I'm just gonna try to forget about this stuff for a while and hopefully make some money in a long, long time from now.

I think it depends on the kind of disaster. If it’s simply a economic downturn, I think people will need money for every day things and withdraw money from their speculative holds like crypto. However, if the downturn us because of some sort of a destabilizing event like a war, then I think people will take refuge in things that are disconnected from the dollar, like crypto.

Where do you guys see this stuff?

Lol, meant $1k of BTC

Hah, exactly. damn close if you are in are able to buy mining gear in bulk, have access to cheap electricity, etc.. Bassicely, are you already a huge minor with access to their resources? Then the answer is no.

Gold didn’t take much of a dive in 2008. I think crypto would though. People want it to be digital gold, but right now it’s all speculation. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 06:04:55
IIRC this is the price when BTC = Gold. Personally, I think that's almost certain. What's uncertain is if other BTC or other cryptos take over all gov backed securities.

There was a lot of useless trivia in there. Good questions were ones on privacy m, bitcoin block rate, etc..
How about: which coins support smart contracts? 
What’s is the smallest unit of eth?
How many confirmations are needed for ltc?
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:29:54
So after the next adjustment the fees should go back up right?
@_date: 2018-01-30 07:36:42
What’s causing this other than lower transaction volume?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:14:21
Been lurking for a while. Only about 2k invested into various coins, though heavy on BTC. Just bought 1k BTC and $500 ETH.
This crash is just as irrational as the 20k spike we had earlier. It might keep going down, but in within 6mo I think I'll be happy.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:45:25
Only one that I know of is tether, but it’s debatable if they founders have deep enough pockets to keep it stable.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:42:09
aaaaand it’s gone
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:32:12
Maybe btc eventually. Right now it can’t come close to the number of transactions needed. Lightening gets closer, but it’s still getting the bugs worked out. Best thing that has a chance is libra for now.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:54:16
I'm not sure about this number of millionaires argument, though it seems silly. There is no specific reason we should have 1 or 80M millionaires, it's just a distribution of wealth.
There are about 80 trillion dollars in the world, the max number of millionaires is 80m, but then the remaining 7.4 billion in the people have nothing (hrm, sounds not far from what we have now actually..)
Aaaaanyway. The real argument for BTC is two-fold:
* It's still around, it hasn't been compromised, hacked or broke in any way, which is a remarkable fact. This means that every day it continues to exist, it gains trust.
* It's a better store of wealth than anything else, right now that store is gold, the argument is that BTC will replace gold. I did some math before, but if BTC were to replace gold that puts its value at about 250k per BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:30:33
I may be wrong, but if I were a trading bot with millions to play with, I would make large transactions like this to reduce the transaction cost. I’m. Im not sure what it is right now, but a few weeks ago it was something like $2 to get on the next block. If you do a bunch of small transactions you’ll pay a lot more if fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:50
Nobody knows, but Bitcoin Cash is just BTC with an 8mb block size. Not anything really different or scalable. The tech isn't interesting to me. IMO Bitcoin will be king until another crypto proves to be far superior, and even when that happens people will probably stay with BTC because they trust it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:24:19
^THIS, I can't get my wallet to connect to anything. IOTA is starting to stink like vaporware IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:22:54
I would go 50% BTC, 25% LTC 25% ETH. Because those are on Coinbase they are going to get a lot more exposure to buyers. LTC/ETH tend to do hedge well against BTC, so it's nice to see something go up when BTC falls. They all have been rocket ships in the last 6mo.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:59
I respectfully disagree. Read the Wikipedia link and it doesn't contradict your link from smithsonian at all. Instead, it offers more references and details. 
What is incorrect the way the Tulip mania is sold to the public. It was a very short bubble amount the social elite, it didn't lead to a crash or any real economic change. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:15:17
I would say 3, but I would add that there are a large number of whales that would like to lower their exposure, the 19k-20k would be a natural place for that. 
Who knows how long it'll hold, my guess is BTC goes NUTS on the 25th/26th as Johnny visits the family and can't shut up about how much money he's made off BTC and how his whole family should get a little piece of the action. 
It happened right after Thanksgiving just a few weeks back. Look at the run from Nov 30th - Dec 7th. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:38:38
Yeah, that's not true. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:35:24
Unless the minors can agree on some governance then no. The tech will only be forked, the original BTC chain will live on and barely function as a currency.
BUT THAT'S NOT BAD, IT'S OK. You have to think of BTC as Gold. Gold has no value, it's just a heavy rock. Sure you can make some jewelry out of it, but its value is held as a reserve currency. A hedge against fiat currencies. BTC is just like gold, except it's much safer (google fake gold bars) and much more transferable. 
So, what would bitcoins price be if it just replaced gold as a reserve currency? Well, Golds market cap is around $7 trillion, BTC is around 318b right now. So quick math:
Gold Market cap 100t
BTC Market cap 300b
Current price 19k
Price of 1 BTC to match gold.
(7,000,000,000,000 / 318,539,890,795) * 19,000 = 417,530
Or about 420k per BTC.

Maybe I’m weird, I would put my put my wallet into a encrypted zip, maybe encrypt that with something else. Then embed it into a photo on Facebook of Flickr using a steggo app, maybe LSB-Steganography. 
Everything’s in the cloud, but nobody knows that, or where it is. Even if they did, they wouldn’t be able to decrypt it.
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:05:35
File will only get corrupted if somehow the bits get messed with, in that case your fucked either way.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:52:44
This is a very old and repeated question. Btc purposely didn’t do large or quick block times because they don’t solve anything. They just mitigate the current issues. 
Solutions to what your taking. About are found in the lightening network and others like it.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:32:29
Sure, use rar. I would encrypt it twice just to make sure either way.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:30:03
I think it's a great idea to dollar cost average. I buy a certain amount each month. I don't spend it though, except to test things like lightning.
I see BTC either going to 0 or $350,000 at a minimum. It's not a safe bet, but there is a decent chance it replaces gold. That would put the price of each coin at least $350k. Where 7.5 trillion is the total value of all the gold and 21 million are the total coins ever mined.
I am very bullish in Libra, or another coin like it to legitimize digital currency. I think once people start distrusting paper and numbers on a screen from a bank, but actual provable value via crypto. BTC, if it lasts will be very valuable as a store of money.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:50:30
Doesn’t this happen every 6 months?

Yeah I heard this and really hoped you guys don’t have annuities through him. If a financial advisor isn’t a fiduciary, their salesmen, high connection ones at that.

Coinbase does, I use them.

Oh man, yeah. I bought 1 BTC from a buddy for $5. Have no idea where it went.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:00:33
Kind of a silly question. It's been around for 10 years and is still a thing. It's going to $0 or, well who knows the highest price, but I could see it easily going into the $100-500k range

I’m confused, isn’t collateral something of value that’s not liquid, like a house of fancy watch to secure a loan for cash? Btc is totally liquid, you can trade it for any currency instantly.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:42:20
I donno, I told myself $1m, but if it got that I would probably just keep holding.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:22:26
This is very cool. But it’s not going to really make a dent until they make it work on a app that has the same ease of use as vinmo. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:55:22
I disagree. We need pioneers for real testing. Real people with real money is going to accelerate shaking down bugs much faster.
I for one, ran a c-lightning node on mainnet, nearly lost a whole $20 due to a bug, but cdocker posted a fix and I got my money back.
As long as everyone knows it's not ready for primetime, doesn't commit any more than they are willing to lose it's fine. If someone does do that, fuck them honestly. Nobody is saying it's stable.

They don't have an agenda other than clicks. If it's going down, people think they were right, and click on articles saying it's going nowhere. When it goes up, the opposite.

I thought it was a balanced piece. Giving a healthy dose of warning to the unlimited scams and frauds that orbit the crypto world, but at the same time not discounting the possible revolution that crypto has.

As others have said. The cat is out of the bag anyway. It's like telling teens not to have sex, it's gonna happen. The best thing you can do is educate and plan for what's going to happen next.
