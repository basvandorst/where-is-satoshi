Aye, certainly.
Or, even simply the common state of affairs: there may well be some competent people, long since overwhelmed by feature creep and mounting technical debt, with the architecture documentation slowly fading into irrelevance by hack after hack.
I have very little experience myself, but extrapolating wildly from it, I'm far more amazed that software generally works as well as it does given the staffing and way of running software shops than I am surprised when things go wrong.

Eh, I think that *could* be handled properly, but you're right that one wouldn't expect them to be a major contributor. Personally, I think learners can be a great contribution to documentation by being fresh eyes going from no knowledge of the system trying to get to mastery. They can help to see what needs to be there, ask the questions and read code and learn how things work, and write and edit the resulting documentation.
That said, no one (?) does it that way, more's the pity. Everyone needs to put in their LOC!

Yeah, I think we're using terminology differently here. The release of a coin isn't generally called an ICO.
Small bit of history: so Bitcoin was released, anyone could mine it. Other coins slowly started being released, and occasionally they would have a "pre-mine", where the creator mined for a while before they released it to get coins for themselves. Eventually, they stopped bothering to mine it, and just wrote it into the code.
"Pre-mine" was considered a dirty word, so they started calling it an "ICO", and they would generate the coins and then sell them.
So where Bitcoin was open to anyone to mine, an ICO would just make the coins and then the only way to get them would be to buy them from the creator. Sometimes coins would do a mixture of ICO and mining (like Ethereum for instance).
But yeah, I got what you meant; it's just weird to see that term used with Bitcoin.
But holy shit, if you think you could find the dump, that's like the level where it's almost worth buying it and searching it until the HDD is found, but I sure wouldn't want to be facing a choice like that.
I kick myself for not buying in at like $5-$10; I can't imagine if I had and then had gotten rid of the coins....

Sure. It's also a privilege to not have your ability to have shelter or food dependent upon that work and productivity. Preaching the nobility of work to those struggling to survive seems just a bit wrong somehow.
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:32:28


No, but it turns out the government makes this paper which people are willing to exchange food and shelter for.
And, yes, when one says something is a "privilege", that *is* a contrast from "right". Good observation!


By "work" here, do we mean the economic sense or the physics sense? Because, shockingly, it turns out that economics work is not necessary to one's actual survival if one has another source of funding. It's true though that the process of living does involve work in the physical sense.


They're often related, but the connection is not always so direct. The hardest work I've ever done has also been the lowest paying. Conversely, the most money I've ever made has come from what can't really be called work.
Perhaps though the difference comes from the meaning of "excel". So long as you define "excel" to mean "work hard", then I suppose you're right!

[I made a semi-satirical proposal almost two years ago about how current tech then could do 100,000 tps.]( "Layer 2" essentially is proposed to be a representation based on a transaction on an actual blockchain each time.
It's very much at the conceptual / sci fi sort of level, but at the same time, in practice, this is sort of how large exchanges and pools operate: their theoretical throughput capacity, both burst and sustained, is higher than any one of their coins if they're operating correctly (even if unlikely to ever max out any of those options), because they could in theory be routing between networks as traffic demands.
I think there's still a lot of practical question to be answered beyond the simple O complexity of the various requirements in terms of answering how well these coins will scale. But apart from Bitcoin, none of them have anywhere near as low of a self-imposed limit generally, so it's at least not as pressing of a concern. It's likely to take most of them a long time to reach as much volume.
And one might hope lessons will have been learned from Bitcoin 1MB.

Not quite what I was thinking actually: I had shifted from your setup to my concept of a third-party taxi company that's being paid.
If it's your own car, I don't really understand why bitcoin would be needed at all. The one argument I could see for doing it as you suggest with keeping the proof on bitcoin would be that it should have the maximum security. So I suppose if one wanted to be really paranoid about one's car, then aye, sort of a keystone transaction on bitcoin to prove ownership, and then right, the rest of the data on an alternate chain and "linked" with a signature and pointer of some sort (signature proves same identity; pointer just like a transaction id or something to indicate what is being referenced on the other chain).

Yes. If you're in cold storage, you're fine.


Old addresses are still compatible. It's only the old wallets [the software] that aren't. The wallet.dat will be compatible with the new version.


A successful fork? I don't think they would. The tricky stuff is if, say, you were on the wrong fork and you received coins there, so you send the product, and then it turns out your coins are worthless because no one else accepts coins on that fork (and they separately sent those coins to a different address on the successful fork).

My definition of tiny is that, in current $ terms, I would expect an individual to hold $10 or less, and in current BTC terms, less than 0.1 BTC (yes the latter is higher; very rough estimates). But I'm also expecting and hoping to see strong appreciation against both of those currencies.
Not to mention that, even at those levels, the idea of operating anything that acts as a financial institution is absolutely terrifying to me given that I'm currently under US jurisdiction.

That was the case with me doing software jobs and prior fast food jobs I've done. Now that I'm a pizza delivery boy, it's actually pretty cool getting paid cash every night (from tips; hourly comes through an actual physical paycheck but the tips part actually pays cash each shift and totals more too). On the other hand...it does feel concerning to be carrying around or having to find places to store cash. But I don't really want to just keep throwing it all at the bank either; it's nice to have that choice at least from being paid in cash.

Agreed. Even if they don't think there is any need to increase now (which I can certainly sympathize with) and they believe there are significant possible downsides (ditto), I think they need to be making a visible move towards compromise to keep the team together, simply out of respect for the "other side" if nothing else.
If the community sees it as a choice between 1Mb forever and 20Mb hard limit increase now, then I expect the latter will win and the former will be a persistent minority. Bitcoin will survive (reproduce, actually, even), but I think it will weaken it.

No concerns on the delay, despite it being a year in internet-time. ;-p
That makes sense. I do believe that you can do so without a risk to customer funds, and it makes sense as a business model. I can certainly understand customer concerns about it though, as many holders would generally prefer to avoid actions which would help "bears".
On the other hand, it's just adding liquidity which would ultimately come from *somewhere*, so why not them, and the market should be able to find its equilibrium ultimately regardless of whether shorting (leveraged or not) is available.
Although, actually, I just realized that "leveraged trades" actually sounds more like someone wanting to go long on BTC beyond their actual means, like buying at 2x or something. And if so...that would seem like a good fit, actually. In some ways, it's like adding fractional reserve into the system, but at least in a transparent and optional way (the customer deposits aren't fractional reserve necessarily but the leveraged account might be considered as such). It certainly would be interesting to know more details about how that would work.
Thanks for the response!

The dollar supports more transactions than gold, too.
Over in they've talked about this. They put it like, if BTC is gold, and LTC is silver, then let DOGE be online cash. I can absolutely see it in the "long-run" (5+ years out or so). Right now BTC and LTC are more viable I think because DOGE is still pretty cheap for using for retail. But as they rise in value, and the transaction costs slowly trend up, the cheaper, everyday transactions move down.

I agree with your position. I don't find the technical issue of the block sizes as concerning as the overall tone of the debate. I don't believe all of the issues there are on one size, but I am starting to finally be convinced that the "conservative" side (for lack of a better term) really needs to be making a move towards compromising with the "increasers", even if it's just to suggest a 2Mb block size limit.
Actually, I think a 2Mb would be a good start for a few reasons: it lets those who say (like myself) that a hard fork would be possible to do relatively quickly with strong consensus an opportunity to demonstrate that. Doubling the capacity is still enough for us to observe and consider further. And it at least represents a step forward, a willingness to work together.
I want to see this development team work as a team. We've got a lot of smart, dedicated people and I would really like to keep them, because I sure don't want to step up and do the work they've been doing.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:03:23
It would conceivably be possible to launch the fork with a minority of the power as well. All that would be necessary is to make the fork incompatible with the classical version (for instance, requiring a &gt;1Mb block at block X; blocks X+1 are then on the new system regardless of the hashing power of Bitcoin Classic).

I think most people here are honestly trying to do the best they can. I think one of our weakest areas is in being able to disagree without questioning the motives of those we're disagreeing with, which is admittedly hard because there are a lot of quite, well, disagreeable people here.

I'm not saying I'm opposed to a block size increase. But I'm not afraid of not having one, or of blocks being filled for a while.


And given the design and testing that has been done, 'degraded mode' would be the answer. I've seen zero evidence whatsoever bitcoin will magically catastrophically fail technically because blocks are full for a while, as you're claiming by implication here. Care to back that up, or is your experience supposed to substitute for facts?


You think they haven't heard that yet? I would say the efficient market hypothesis would imply this is already priced in.

That does not explain why you would be willing to take a loss now without a stated plan for how to make money on it later.
I have considered making a cryptocurrency "savings account" which pays interest, but for me, the incentive is pretty clear: I would be doing it as a promotional activity for the altcoin in question, and I already spend enough of that coin that the interest would be a relatively small part of an overall promotional budget to increase the value of my other coins.
If you said, "this is a promotional vehicle for BTC.sx", that could make some sense. If you said, "we have hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and figure this will drive enough price appreciation to pay for itself", that too would be conceivable.
But when you say, "we're making enough money to afford to do this, and later on we'll figure out how to make money on it", well, that's not the sort of business logic I would put any funds into.
If I'm going to put coins into something with no business model, I'll stick to the relatively transparent ponzi schemes which at least will double or nothing much more quickly.

And yet it has been used for currency for centuries. So apparently there's a bar below which it doesn't have enough value to be a significant threat to gold, eh? Would you say that copper currency could complement gold currency by allowing easier exchange in smaller denominations?


This is a facile argument which misses the entire point. Why is gold valuable? Your argument claims it is because there are a limited number of other precious metals. Do you notice the circular nature of this argument? No, of course not.
Okay, let's try it another way: why are the precious metals precious, and the others are not "precious metals"? Does the existence of tin threaten gold?
Okay, but only precious metals matter in your mind. And if there were somehow an infinite supply, then they would not be precious. Sure. *But what makes them precious*? Is it the lack of other metals available in the world. Clearly not. What distinguishes various precious metals from each other? Why are the market values of silver and gold not approximately equal?
Oh, everything is supply and demand? Gee, how tritely simple everything is. So if there is a smaller supply of a certain metal, it will automatically be more valuable? No? Because of demand? Okay then...what explains the variable demand?
By your 'logic', the mere existence of other metals which have a limited supply should diminish the value of gold. Can you provide any evidence to this effect, beyond your "uhh, I think it works like this"? You realize there are other metals (and other materials), which are more rare than gold, right? What makes gold "gold"? Why is it a standard store of value for millennia across many human cultures? According to your argument, it is only because there are no other possible substitutes, but this is demonstrably false.
Further, again, silver and gold are not interchangeable. The fact that they are both precious metals does not make the supply of one have any direct impact on the other.

Sure, that would be possible. Although lukedashjr might murder you for polluting the blockchain.
This has some security from the signatures to make sure you're authorized. On the other hand, that could be done with direct communication too.
So what would be the advantage to a permanent, public record of the commands? Perhaps there would be some sort of use for something that needs to be auditable. Perhaps a taxi company would choose to have their autonomous cabs be requested by something like that: a payment could include the directions for where a cab is supposed to go, for instance.
So, sure, I think there are going to be applications for having commands in a transaction. But it's going to feed into the debate about bloating the blockchain.
If only there were some sort of alternative blockchains available where such pollution weren't an issue. Fortunately though, we live in a world where there is only one blockchain and no one will ever have to worry their mind about anything else, so we can rule out any such applications because we don't want to waste the precious, very limited resource of blockchain space. Let the holy war continue!

As someone who plans to leave the US as soon as possible (which, given my financial situation, will be a while) in order to have the freedom to pursue various cryptocurrency projects I have in mind, I would certainly like to see him make a solid run of it. I've been disappointed at the usual bullshit where a lot of fake conservatives, Republican party hacks dismiss him out of hand. It would be incredible to see him be able to make a strong run.
I pledge that I will donate 0.1 BTC to his campaign. It's not much, and even with my tight finances I know I could afford more, but it's enough to matter to me, and low enough that I know I will keep this commitment. If I somehow have a lot more money than I expect then, I will donate more, but I will donate at least 0.1 BTC regardless.
In my view, we are only seeing the very beginning of the cryptocurrency world. I believe there is an incredible wealth of potential which can be unlocked by this technology. I don't know where this will all go, but I look forward to seeing what happens, and I expect that those countries which allow the most freedom will ultimately see the strongest benefit from this new economy.

No. Further, it is not possible to implement the change as a soft-fork (where only the miners need to upgrade). It requires a hard-fork (where everyone needs to upgrade), because it is removing what previously was a limit which would invalidate what would now be acceptable. That is to say, existing software would reject a 2Mb block. The new software will accept it. Therefore everyone must be on the new software, or those who aren't will reject the new version, and thus, fork.

Moldova is my personal choice for a variety of reasons. I got into it with (is also me). It may still take a team of lawyers, but they'll be far cheaper lawyers. And I'll have a lot of other ancillary benefits from being located there as well.


Sure, but if I exist in the US, then the US is going to claim jurisdiction over me regardless of where my server is located. I would prefer not to spend time in prison for operating a business which has "bank" in its name. The US isn't big on denying jurisdiction over the entire world, in particular its citizens, so it's a distinct possibility in any case, but I think my odds are a lot better if I happen to not be located on their soil.
edit: Since you're so convinced about the safety of operating in the US and how there are no draconian regulations, what's the major cryptocurrency institution that you're running while being located in the United States, for the record?
edit 2: Oh, hey, your comment history shows you know that KYC exists. So explain to me precisely how you suggest that you could avoid prison in the US because you're "operating a business in a foreign country"? What sort of bullshit logic do you think will convince the feds that because you logged into a foreign server they don't get to control your life? Not to mention the fact that regardless of your claims, they'll feel free to lock you up while arguing about it anyhow.
So, yeah, I'd like to be as far beyond their fucking reach as possible before I touch anything to do with a cryptocurrency financial institution.

But the point of altcoins is that people don't need a one-size-fits-all security solution. The fact is that a true double-spend is very unlikely. Even the "double transaction" "double spend" is very improbable. Which means that a single confirmation of Dogecoin is plenty for your morning latte.
And yes, it is a significantly higher barrier to reorganize a block chain, even the lowly Dogechain (/s), than to just issue a second transaction. The "protection" bitcoin provides at this point for 0-confirmations is just a quirk of people running defaults rather than anything promised by the protocol. The protection of a block, any block, is greater than that.

As hydro said, it goes to the stock market. The reason is that this money isn't equally distributed to everyone. If it were, rent would be going up and things like that.

A summary would be useful comparing this to the existing coins which implement anonymity. I'm not convinced their "related work" is complete, although it's certainly possible I'm missing something.
With that said, I do find this sort of document interesting and valuable. I realize that considers everything not bitcoin to be irrelevant. I think that's strange given their willingness to discuss various fiat considerations and news.

There's a difference between having heard of it and knowing how to use it. You claim in your comment that people "in the real world" haven't heard of bitcoin. I don't think that's as true anymore. And your example isn't of someone not having heard of it either.
It's a significant point because two or three years ago, the average person really wouldn't have heard of it. Now they have. That's progress. Sure, it doesn't guarantee the next step, but people have to have heard of it before they can consider whether or not to learn more or use it.

It will stop being anonymous, huh? So it'll stop being something it never was? Always fun to see people critique a system without knowing its most basic characteristics. Gee, that's exactly what they always accuse us of doing anytime we say anything about fiat (like, you know, it always loses value in the long-term).


So, if we ignore the benefit of increased mining activity, then there is no benefit to increased mining activity. Brilliant! I wonder why no one in the community could come up with this level of analysis!
Nothing makes me feel more confident in the future of bitcoin than seeing the pathetic attempts of those who don't understand it to critique it.
edit 2:


Yes, free market dynamics are such a curious coincidence. What a shock that the cost of production would be about the same as the current market value! Who would've thunk it? And they totally fail to notice that with shifting market values, there will be correspondingly shifting costs of production (of course, with some complexity because of sunk cost vs marginal operating costs, but hey, they don't bother to think things through; why should we?).
edit 3:
Okay, fine, in the next paragraph they sort of address this. But that statement above makes it seem like this is a totally mysterious outcome rather than an equilibrium being reached. And they do continue onto being totally clueless again:


...wtf. So idiotic. "If we assume that the hardware will disappear because it's being replaced, and then we stop replacing it, then everything blows up!" Yes, and if I assume that Visa will decide to stop processing transactions, then it won't keep existing!
edit 4:


Brilliant. Except that there's no way they can enforce a barrier to entry and they create an incentive for competition if they restrict themselves, so this is totally unfeasible. But hey, it fits there theme, so that's awesome!
edit 5:


Right, so if we make up bullshit reasons why everyone will stop supporting the system and let it die, then it won't work anymore. Gee, who would've thought. News flash: if everyone stops mining tomorrow, then transactions won't go through? Oh my god, stop the presses!
Of course, they've given no plausible reason why everyone will roll over and die. They've failed to note the incentive that every holder of bitcoin or provider of bitcoin services has to keep it running. And they fail to note that these incentives counter precisely the issue they're talking about and have worked successfully in the past. There is no empirical evidence that I'm aware of that we face any imminent 51% situation, and yet we have in the past. So this inevitable, natural monopoly they posit appears to be countered by reality. But why should that matter? Reality is irrelevant to writing a paper where you get to appear clever for claiming new technology can't possibly work.
edit 6:


They finally acknowledge this in a footnote after referring casually to bitcoin being "anonymous" or failing to continue to be anonymous throughout the rest of the paper.
edit 7:
And they postulate a totally bizarre theory, that keeping blocks secret will give a higher yield, ignoring that this will simply result in a 100% orphan rate. And reference a similarly bizarre claim that one-third of the hashing power would be capable of pulling this off.
A lot of paranoid blah blah blah dressed up in condescending nonsense. And they start just throwing anything they can at it, after failing to prove their central point, the strong claim that inevitably the market will be taken over and destroyed by a 51% attack (or their fantastical 33% attack).
They basically end at "GHash got over 51% for a bit, so therefore bitcoin is dead."


What a shock.

I wiped the article from my mind after reading it. But here are the two ways that bitcoin users pay bitcoin miners:
1. Direct transaction fees. When you send BTC, usually a transaction fee is included.
2. Indirect inflation cost. Each block gives a BTC reward to the miner. This inflation is an indirect cost to all users by diluting the buying power of their bitcoins. Of course, unlike fiat, this inflation of the monetary supply is deterministic and limited by math.

I'm far closer to the "there is no current problem and we can deal with it slowly", but between the current "let's do nothing right now" and the 20Mb plan, I have to side with the latter because popular opinion is beyond ready to do *something* to address this.
I would have liked to see more visible movement towards a compromise position from all of the developers who believe there is not an imminent crisis at 1Mb. Whether it be 2Mb or 8Mb or whatever, I think they should've been more willing to compromise earlier on, as now the community is basically forced to choose between two extremes (at least as they see it; I still think it would be possible to not do the 20Mb and do a more modest increase, but without that being put forward by the other core developers, it makes it seem like the choice is 1Mb forever).

If the discussion were about Adobe Photoshop, perhaps. But if they simply refused to acknowledge that art could be produced by that medium, they aren't actually talking about all art. Perhaps they should retitle their group "pre-21st century art" or similar.


Right, "relies on math" does not imply "mathematical subject". Nonetheless, practically everything in computer science *is* math. It's a particular sub-field of math, but excluding computer science from math makes as much sense as excluding a discussion of prime numbers because you just don't like that subfield as much.
And, again, cryptography is a mathematical subject.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:21:36


The code isn't the hard part here. Which, knowing you, I expect you know. So I'm surprised at this comment.
There is already a stated plan out there to release the 20Mb XT version. The debate and discussion absolutely is important for whether or not people will adopt that. If Gavin had simply released the code without discussion a month ago and told everyone to upgrade, I don't think there would have been consensus for it.
After all of the debate over the last month, I think most of the people paying attention are ready to make a decision.
I agree with you that this "study" is pointless. And the BTC would be better spent donating to whichever devs OP wanted to support. But c'est la vie; people do what they want to do with their money.
But I really don't see releasing the code as the limiting factor, given that it's basically (or exactly?) a one-line change which is already stated to be released soon(tm).
I also agree that people generally seem pretty eager for this change, or at least something increasing the block size.

Well that's just silly. Everyone knows that's my favorite altcoin that claims that. Bitcoin has the perfectly reasonable goal of going to the moon. Others dream further.

Store of value is a use. In fact, I don't believe that bitcoin needs retail; it could operate entirely as a store of value.
I mean, this piece is shit from beginning to end, so it's just a matter of picking which details one wants to mock. But this writer's logic would basically argue that gold is not being used because people try to hold onto it and stores would almost never accept payment in gold.


Right, why bother to do research when writing a blog? Let's just pull the "facts" out of our ass, neh?

The dollar supports more transactions than gold, too.
Over in they've talked about this. They put it like, if BTC is gold, and LTC is silver, then let DOGE be online cash. I can absolutely see it in the "long-run" (5+ years out or so). Right now BTC and LTC are more viable I think because DOGE is still pretty cheap for using for retail. But as they rise in value, and the transaction costs slowly trend up, the cheaper, everyday transactions move down.

Yeah, there's certainly a possible argument for physics, but it's not particularly core to the field in my view. Again, I can see the argument, I just don't think it's especially strong. Information theory is more of an application than a core subject for physics.
By that argument, biology includes all of anthropology, economics, etc. But your typical biologist wouldn't agree with such an expansive definition of the field I don't think. The generally accepted boundaries for biology typically exclude the higher-order complexities of human society. It's not about whether the social rules for ants and bees are more important. It's a matter of not just shoving everything into the same box just because it could possibly be conceived of. In fact, it's the fact that the social rules for bees and ants *aren't* as important that they aren't generally considered worth their own subject.

Yes. They just didn't have major mainstream news outlets. I worked with a retired pension fund manager who was talking about it and who had pulled most of his money out beforehand. If it were anyone else, I might have doubted him, but he was a very quiet and honest guy. He says he saw it coming and pulled out his money, and I believe it.
Now, I'm just some random guy telling an anecdote about some other random guy, but, of course, *some* people saw it coming. And I think it was far more than just a few people randomly getting lucky (stopped clock sort of thing). I think it has to do with those few people who were intelligent and knowledgeable to think for themselves about the state of the overall economy.


Mass media is as much of an echo chamber as Reddit is. Probably more so, actually, given the gated access and highly concentrated ownership of those gatekeepers. So as far as that goes, it was probably far more "everyone agreed".

It's acceptable on the protocol. It's not a fork. You may not like the behavior, but they're not doing anything wrong by doing it. 0-confirmation transactions are not on the blockchain. If merchants want to pretend they're irrevocable payments, then yes, they expose themselves to that transaction not ultimately going through.
Everyone's been so busy talking about how bitcoin is instant and we can ignore confirmations that they work themselves into this asinine position where we pretend like anyone who ever does anything to expose that bullshit is pilloried.
Like, you know, pointing out that if you actually need to get something confirmed faster you could use basically any altcoin ever. If you want a high-security confirmation, use bitcoin. If you want to use 0-confirmation bitcoin transactions, then be fucking aware *they aren't confirmed*. Those coins aren't spent until they're on the blockchain.
But yeah, go ahead and demonize them for doing a protocol-compatible change and reversing it shortly thereafter. Sure, it would have been better if they'd announced it first and gotten your personal permission. But to act like *they* are responsible for the fact that 0-confirmation transactions aren't, you know, confirmed is idiotic.

I have somewhere, but don't have time to look it up right now. But it was floated, but he didn't take back his 20Mb position and that's the official plan for the XT as I understand it.
I'm really disappointed at the track this seems to be going down: it seems like people are only going to have the choice between 1Mb with no roadmap towards more or 20Mb hard fork now. Granted, like I said, that doesn't mean 20Mb blocks will actually happen immediately, although I wouldn't be surprised if some miners raise their soft limit considerably to maximize fees and we get enough spam to create some blocks 15+ Mb.

There's more than that. Its point about how banks can be useful is relevant too. Sure, at first glance it's easy to say "look, no bank needed", but in reality, it's useful to have a bank for the same reason it was before: because most people don't want to manage the basics of the security of their money.
Is it possible to manage without a bank? Certainly. But that doesn't mean they're pointless either.
Of course, there's the whole "if you don't hold the private key, you don't own it", and I agree with that. But for some people, it's more useful to "not own it" and be able to let someone else manage it than it is to have to do all that themselves, and it may be safer for them too. Not everyone is capable of doing basic computer security. Unfortunately, some of that group has included those who are providing banklike services...there's absolutely a lot of shaking out of the inept that will continue to happen over the years. But I expect there will be banks in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem, some of them legacy banks which add bitcoin support, and some new entrants to the market which may look very different from the traditional bank.

I've always thought it's strange to call it such. I mean, what I think of as double spending is the block-reorganization attack (the "51%" attack).
In this case, it seems more to me like there are suddenly two competing coins. Spending one or spending the other isn't double spending anymore than spending a LTC and then a DOGE.
I totally understand the difficulty of working in a system where it's not known which of the two will survive and be considered canonical, but personally, I think of it as two separate spends rather than a double spend.
Granted, it gets confusing fast, like how if you weren't aware of the other chain and made a transaction with all pre-split inputs, then the recipient could simply relay that transaction to the other chain to make sure they're getting both versions of the coins.

Right, it's absolutely not a question merely of "which thing would be the nicest to have" but "what is the most effective use of our time". But then, like bitcoin itself, our processes don't tend to be efficient: all of the debate and noise is quite arguably not 100% efficient. But that's the great thing about the crowd-sourcing type of thing, is that we can afford to waste a lot of effort and yet still do more than competitors (see, for instance, Wikipedia; lots of inefficiency yet produces a great final outcome).
Anyhow, yeah, your approach is absolutely right: we have to consider the cost and not merely the benefit.
edit: On the other hand, I do think it's really good to be aware of all the other things to consider too. As the author says, it's easy to think that all we have to do is increase the block size and then moon, when the reality is there's a lot of work to do. Which isn't a bad thing. This is a very big project; of course there's a lot to work on.

Well, if all you're doing is the data storage, what need for linking?
Or, think of a hybrid system like this: suppose that the payment is on the Bitcoin blockchain, because it's the gold standard payment. Then suppose the accompanying data is stored in another blockchain, which is specialized for data storage and has quite cheap transactions. The link between the two could be established in the data entry with a signature by the account which sent the initial payment.
So bitcoin transfers the value, the data is stored in a blockchain but doesn't bloat the bitcoin blockchain, and we move onto solving the next magical problem of future blockchain use. :-)

No, you're wrong. The hard fork means that the new chain won't be recognized by the old client. But it still accepts the old chain. That's called "backwards compatible." That means that if the old chain were to have the majority of the mining power, its chain would be longer, and the new client would be showing the exact same chain as the old client (with potentially some occasional new blocks, but that chain would keep falling behind and getting rejected).


But it's not relevant because of the 80% requirement before they start the larger blocks, so

Yes, I should have updated my comment after reading the rest of the thread here; I'm sorry.
As a promotional effort, it makes sense; it's not such an extreme rate that it's unbelievable, and in particular with the capped deposits. Along with, as you point out, linking your afk identities and having the existing company associated with it.
Personally, the risk would still not be worth it to me for that rate, but there is a clear benefit to you for this and a clear reason why you won't run off with the funds.
However, with that said, can you confirm or deny that customer deposits will be lent on the exchange for shorts? I know that you've stated that there will be full reserves, but it seems conceivable to me that might not rule such a thing out depending on how exactly one interpreted it. If you explicitly deny that customer BTC would ever contribute in any way towards BTC loaned on the exchange, I think that would end the only other criticism I can think of.
Apologies if you've already addressed that elsewhere as well.

Really good questions! One of the things that's very different about bitcoin compared to prior forms of money is needing a basic working knowledge of cryptography, something which is very useful in today's world but is relatively uncommon.
Thus I'm going to try to make a very simple introduction to cryptography in general, as the other answers have addressed the bitcoin-specific points in detail.
"Public-key cryptography" is a form of cryptography (mathematical ways of exchanging messages securely, essentially) wherein there are two keys used, a "public" and a "private" key. The public key can be published to the world. The private key is your secret which allows you to "sign" messages and prove that they came from "you" (actually, that they came from someone who had the private key to that public key), or for someone else to send a message which only "you" can read (similarly, only someone with the private key to that public key).
The underlying math which makes this all work is quite complex and makes my head hurt. Fortunately, other people take care of all those details and we just trust them (this is not a mathematical proof, but in practice, this is how most of us live).
Now, going back to bitcoin applications. The other answers covered this well; I'll try not to be too repetitive. The public key is converted to the address that you're used to seeing (it's a hash, which is sort of like a barcode in being a short-hand way to refer to a particular thing). The private key is stored in your wallet.dat.
You can re-use your existing addresses. The question of whether you *should* or not is somewhat open. In short, it is probably the best security to use a different address for each thing you do, while it can be more convenient to re-use an address. If you re-use addresses, it will be easier for someone to identify you, although you should be aware that may be possible anyhow, in particular without knowing the system in detail (for instance, even if you use new addresses all the time, when you go to spend, your wallet may choose to combine whichever of those it finds most convenient, which could reveal your identity by linking addresses; there is not currently a user-friendly way to deal with this (known as 'coin control') as far as I know).
I hope that helps!

Just last night I installed Ubuntu on a relatively non-technical independent bookstore owner's computer because her Windows installation had gotten screwed up and she didn't have recovery disks. She was quite happy with the outcome. While I was there this morning confirming she was satisfied, another customer chimed in talking about how the new snack machines he's working with are running on Linux.
Neither of them were highly technical, but both had some exposure to and a positive opinion of Linux.
If bitcoin were to follow the same general route, one would expect it to keep being an obscure, almost-joke, until it is simply ubiquitous in the background and no one really considers it surprising anymore.

I interpreted that as just meaning the "the bitcoin option is gone" as put it. I'm not sure why people are getting so annoyed. I think the translation English was possible to misinterpret, but it's not at all clear to me that it deserves that much hate.
They not accepting BTC now. They might in the future. That message was clear in the original translation attempt and clearer in the second.
edit: I think the main difference, from reading further and re-reading the translation above is making it clear that they *are* working on a solution rather than deciding whether or not to work on one. So I can see where you would interpret what he wrote as wrong ("anymore" implying "not going to for the on-going future"), but I think it's just a little bit of weak English. Mayhaps we could cut the guy some minor slack...

I couldn't agree more. And I know exactly what you mean. I deliberately avoid mentioning any other cryptocurrency on this subreddit, in general. This is why I try to use humor and slightly veiled references if I ever approach the topic here. ;-)
I do find it unfortunate. I believe that other cryptocurrencies are complementary to bitcoin rather than primarily competitive. Dogecoin is not going to replace Bitcoin. But it can be an excellent gateway to those new to cryptocurrencies, and because it's a "clonecoin" (my term for all those cryptocurrencies derived from a fork (or a fork of a fork, etc) of Bitcoin), the underlying technology is almost indistinguishable and makes for a very easy transition for users from Dogecoin to Bitcoin once they become comfortable using it.

@_date: 2015-06-17 01:16:49
Not necessarily. Let's say you were careful to only use an address once, only receiving once per address. Let's also say you're careful when spending to use only one input and have two outputs: one the payment, and one a "change address", which is also a new address controlled by you. Now, multiple spends from the same original input can be pretty easily linked, but each of your original receive addresses are unlinked (we'll ignore here how to separate multiple spends from the same original input as well as how to combine (or spend in the same transaction) small change UTXOs without linking them to an attacker's perspective for the sake of simplicity; there are various strategies for this but I think it's out of scope here).
Compare that to having some tiny inputs added to an old, now-empty address along with a lack of coin control. The empty address would never have been re-used, and so there is no additional information available to an attacker for de-anonymizing that address apart from the existing transactions coming out of it. By adding that tiny input to it, the attacker can now observe an additional transaction linking that address to other addresses with more coins, and so we can link original receive addresses which would not have been able to be linked based on the strategy described above.

Similarly, it deeply concerns me that Cryptsy runs a cloud mining service.
Curiously enough, I can actually see a use for cloud mining that wasn't a scam: I had a period of time where I was hitting a lot of issues from having inconsistent hashing on the altcoin I play with. So it could've been useful for me to be able to do what is essentially cloud mining: paying someone else to put some hashing on it. They could get an above-market return on their hardware, and I wouldn't need to manage it or put up the capital.

It's a nice move to make it flexible for scalability and resilience, although, of course, one could certainly hope that the underlying bitcoin core node would never have a hiccup (I've had good luck on a small scale running a tipbot with the underlying daemon not having issues, but I can certainly see wanting flexibility there).
One spelling mistake:


One comment here:


It seems to me like it's worth mentioning the inherent security risk in this, in that the 3rd party obviously could choose to store that private key themselves...


Interesting consideration. Are you talking about two blocks with the same block number, rather than two consecutive blocks? I would think you mean the former, since the latter would be relatively easy to address with a little bit of logic (for instance, only move the transaction to confirmed when processing exactly the third block confirming it; of course, this requires that you are 100% sure you will process each and every block, but that should be reasonable). For the former case then, it seems to me like it would be possible to have some type of staging step which ensured unique blocks, although once I start to think about that, I start to see some unfortunate possibilities (my naive solution was to say each block number can only be processed once, but what if the first version of that block number which you receive becomes orphaned, so then you're locked into processing the wrong block? And it would be possible for the third confirmation thus to come in two different blocks. However, possibly this wouldn't matter, as in the case I'm imagining it's not a block reorganization, so either one would be fine from the perspective of confirming those transactions from two blocks prior; definitely food for thought for me).


*worthy of *its [own] work paper or book
(I might also suggest 'whitepaper' rather than 'work paper', but it's certainly possible I'm just not personally familiar with the latter phrase and that it's reasonable here)


Just a quibble basically about parallel structure, merely a matter of taste: "adding a balance twice, accidentally deleting records, or simply breaking the database schema."

From what I've heard, Gavin suggested an 8Mb compromise. But then the current plan for the XT fork seems to be back to 20Mb.
On the other hand, keep in mind that the soft limit will likely remain much lower, and even if it were 20Mb immediately, that wouldn't mean 20Mb blocks would be produced unless there were a massive increase in transaction volume.

@_date: 2015-06-30 21:24:15
Frankly, no, I don't think so. I think that "the year of Bitcoin" analogy with the "Linux year of the desktop" one is apt: it's always going to be "just around the corner", to the point where people will ridicule the notion that it will ever catch on and be relevant, while it gains adoption behind-the-scenes in ways that matter more, until the point where the Federal Reserve is more involved in bitcoin than the average person, or even average Redditor, who will still think "it's that ponzi scheme that's used by online criminals" or something stupid like that; just as there are still people who think that Linux is irrelevant because they only know how to use Windows (or because their phone is Android, so how is Linux relevant (yes, yes, I know; that's the point...)).
The hivemind is many different things. Yes, sometimes it's anti-establishment. But it's sort of like place: sure, there's some sympathy to the notion that there are secret plans by the elite, but there's enough noise and foolishness to point and laugh at over there that they become mostly a punchline rather than a community taken seriously.
For instance, I don't see recommending putting a portion of one's savings/investment into Bitcoin anytime soon. I don't know what goes on over at but I'd be surprised if they were taking Bitcoin seriously. etc.
The hivemind also likes simple explanations which make some other group of people look like fools. The Buttcoin interpretation I think is going to be quite compelling.
I don't know; I haven't really wandered into general Reddit in quite some time. I don't even look at my own frontpage much. But I also doubt, for instance, how sincere and deep the concern about privacy is. For instance, if one were really concerned about privacy, Reddit could be a strange platform to be choosing.
There are plenty of mainstream, reasonable-minded people who will look at the hodgepodge of ideas behind Bitcoin and simply laugh, whenever they even bother to take notice. My family mildly tolerates my mentions of the topic, to the point where I don't bother discussing it with the vast majority of them. The idea simply strikes too much at the core of what they've built their entire lives around. When you've sacrificed your entire life to earn something, and seen it apparently control the entire world around you, you believe that has value, and no amount of logic will change that. If someone makes a claim that there's some new and apparently worthless thing which will replace that, they are just a crazy person.

My understanding of why the sub was banned was more based simply on being insulting. I'm not going to go into whether or not they were brigading, or whether it was simply organic or etc.
As I said, "and nothing of value was lost." I'm not going to be getting on a soapbox arguing for FPH to be reinstated.

The planned mechanism for the XT 20Mb version as I understand it is a proof-of-work voting which will require a supermajority of 80% of the last 1000 blocks to indicate support for the upgrade before enabling it. So I think you're trying to solve a problem which doesn't exist.
People have suggested that there would be an incentive for miners to be dishonest in such a "voting", but I find these game theoretic arguments unconvincing. Although it is a heretical and shocking view, I think people are generally somewhat decent. And beyond that, too lazy to figure out and implement all of the supposed game theoretic ways they can screw over everyone else to do a little better.
So, I could be wrong. I've certainly failed to foresee most if not all of what's happened so far with cryptocurrency. But I would be very surprised if the switch to 20Mb happens without actual consensus among the miners.
Of course, that doesn't guarantee there won't be a strong, vocal minority sticking to bitcoin classic. And it may be precisely because they are a minority of the hashing power that they might be interested; smaller miners might see an opportunity to be able to use otherwise inefficient mining hardware on a suddenly-deserted old fork.
I've heard the argument the old fork would die because it won't have enough hashing power to reach a difficulty reset. That's certainly conceivable to me. But if it does reach the reset, then I think all the voting in the world won't matter: I think there will be two different chains in perpetuity competing under the "Bitcoin" brand: one which keeps the 1Mb block size and has a minority of the hashing power and one which expands to the 20Mb block size and has the majority of the hashing power.

That article is really good. It backs up with precise facts what I just sort of threw out as truthy, that we've gone from a situation where there *was* a somewhat dominant pool to a competitive environment.
I have a strange mixture of frustration and amusement when reading these sort of things. They are great critiques of bitcoin to be made (and many have been), but it seems like, as that article points out, the conventional financial background doesn't exactly prepare people to analyze an innovation like bitcoin with any accuracy. They have to deal with objective subjects like cryptography which they are entirely unprepared to do, having spent their entire careers defrauding people by layering fees on top of fees while providing no statistical advantage over index funds. And then they have the nerve to pretend to be experts in anything that may happen to come along. "This can't possibly work because I don't understand it." Convincing.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:01:36
It all depends on how you define "feasible". :-) There are no physical nor mathematical laws against what's being described. That's the usual standard where I say something like "yes, it's possible." Which can be a dangerous standard because pretty quickly it can be "okay, have it done next week" and then suddenly you're going "well, but there is problem A, B, and C to be solved which will take a while" "I thought you said it's possible!" "It is. Those problems are solvable. They will just take 10 years and $100 million."
I'm sure there are people working on various "commands in blockchains" applications, although I can't think of one off the top of my head. But do I think there'll be a car which receives commands from a blockchain on the market in the next five years? Probably not. There's often a significant lag between some particular application being possible and it actually being created. Our hardware is capable of doing much more than we do; the limiting factor is often software development. And this basically depends upon fully self-driving cars being released to be most useful.
You're quite welcome. Talking to new people excited about the possible applications of the technology is a very welcome break from the more typical rehashing of the same old arguments over and over. :-)

So you're going to claim no expertise on the US, while strongly implying that anyone in the US with concern about the law is a fool. Gotcha.


And I'm pointing out that doesn't mean the US is going to roll over and agree they don't have jurisdiction, if you're the sole employee of such business and you are on US soil. And that even if you're not, they may claim it if you happen to be a US citizen, as I am.
And you haven't addressed that point. You just keep throwing up more bullshit to imply that, because I happen to not be you, I must be an idiot.


The thought crossed my mind, yes. Which brings me back to the point of hoping that Rand Paul can make a strong run for it.

Bitcoin is doing fine, technically and economically speaking. I think the community is going through a difficult period. That aspect concerns me.

@_date: 2015-06-17 16:33:11


I don't, actually, because as I said, in that case, I don't see why the logic couldn't be handled simply enough by just saying "only confirm transactions on the block with the third confirmation". Each block should be able to process independently of the other in this case: when you see a block which has the third confirmation, even if it's running ahead of processing the block which has the second confirmation, that shouldn't matter, it's still a valid third confirmation.
I do see why processing two different blocks with the same block number could be problematic, but as long as they aren't reorganizations I think it should be possible to at least be agnostic about which is used as "the" third confirmation.


Awesome; I'm really looking forward to that!

Oh, cool! Great article by the way; I really enjoyed the different perspective.
I agree that would be nice, but I think at this point the community is so fixated it won't be able to think about much else until this gets resolved.
One of the biggest problems is not the technical challenge but the political rift in the core development team that this has caused (or exposed).
But then, I'm on the sidelines watching from rather than digging into the code. I've heard that there's still productive work being done. Still, I think it's going to be necessary for them to reconcile somehow in order for a lot of that work to be done.
For instance, working on formalizing the code: I agree that would be an awesome task. But I think a major project like that really needs some consensus among developers, because it's going to involve refactoring a lot of code, with the typical "if it ain't broke don't fix it" bias. And I wonder how probable that is at this point.
Not to mention, personally, I would think the ad hominem attacks at current leading core developers would tend to discourage others from getting involved.
But maybe I've just convinced myself I need to stop paying attention to and just focus more on the underlying technology.

I think the clonecoins are interesting examples of what could have or could happen to Bitcoin in some terrible case, and they demonstrate exactly that. When there's a core group that is determined to keep it alive, it's not too hard to keep it running.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:22:52
Thanks for the response.
I agree that there's not a crisis. But it seems to me like it adds some benefit, although I think not enough benefit to justify a hard fork (personally, I'm generally opposed to a hard fork except for an absolute necessity, although that's a change in my position since I've also been in favor of a PoS switch in an altcoin in the past).
I read your comment as saying that you don't see a benefit, or at the very least, that it's dwarfed by the tradeoffs. And by implication, I'm guessing your opposition to the expanded block size is the risk of greater centralization from a larger storage and bandwidth client to run bitcoin, correct?
How would you propose to increase the blocksize (and how to determine when it would need to be done), or would you keep it at 1Mb forever?
@_date: 2015-05-10 09:06:46
If someone wanted to do that, one option for them would be to launch their own network which can handle 10k as a proof of concept, buy up a lot of bitcoin, and then propose their solution.
In general though, large holding doesn't equate to some special rights to make demands. On the contrary, in my opinion it's more akin to a responsibility to act for the common good in order to protect the value of their holdings.
No one person is going to just make this demand.
But the point of your question is "can we get from 7 to 10.000?"
Yes, I think we can. We get 100 pretty easily just by upping the block size limits. The next factor of 100 will probably involve some optimizations and *handwave*. But we'll get there when we need it. It's mostly a matter of consensus, and so far, I don't think there is any clear demand for 10.000.
Although I'm sure it'll be useful by the time we get it or soon thereafter.
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:03:17
It's not artificially expensive.
The premium network with competition for getting a transaction into its block will have a slight fee, which will be enough to block microtransactions. It will have a larger market cap and lower spread.
The clone networks will have fees lower both in nominal and actual value because there is less (often no) competition for getting transactions into their blocks.
It's amazing how people can continue to deny currently existing reality. But just keep screaming how you don't understand anything other than monotheism.

@_date: 2015-05-10 05:01:13
Agreed. I was just being snarky. I'm not at all opposed to making the increase, particularly since it'll be a while from when they're code complete to when the switch happens and anyone who wants to run a full node should be able to afford this disk space and etc. But that's all been said a thousand times anyhow, neh? :-)
@_date: 2015-05-31 10:12:51
And in addition, it would be preferable to not have to dedicate an entire computer and line to running bitcoin. So the arguments that "my connection is fast enough to be able to receive the blocks" misses the point that it shouldn't require anywhere near the full capacity.
I've also dealt with mobile connections which were reasonably nice and fast, but where bandwidth is crazy expensive. But then, I already couldn't afford to get the bitcoin blockchain on that.
Below they're suggesting satellite. But while satellite has good bandwidth, it can have terrible latency and be really shitty in bad weather, or at least so it's seemed to me.
I think the most reasonable argument to me is that a person could have a vps which handles it. I think this would be more feasible if we had a tool for an ultralightweight client which just relayed commands (securely) to such a dedicated server. If a relatively cheap VPS plan had enough capacity for this, then having a bitcoin full node would not be financially unreasonable.
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:04:55
I think in the long-run you're right mostly because I don't think there's the depth of talent, in particular in cryptography in almost any of the altcoins to survive. On the other hand, that mostly relevant for the clonecoins. The alts which are based on their on codebase could at least keep going from that objection.
I don't think this shows it has no stability. If we were talking about changing from 21 million, sure. But the fact that you basically convinced me that bitcoin classic will probably be immortal seems to me to be the opposite.
@_date: 2015-05-31 07:39:23


Do the previous allegations about OKC trading against its margin clients using the knowledge of their positions worry you at all?
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:10:46
No, you're right. 
Your second sentence just claimed that the *fees* portion of Bitcoin was modeled on the spam system (hashcash), when I'm trying to add the sort of weird nuance that actually the core of making a bitcoin in the first place is based on hashcash, and that was how spam email would be prevent, but charging a transaction fee to prevent spam isn't really modeled after hashcash, because hashcash was about adding computational difficulty while transaction fees are about adding cost. They both have an anti-spam mechanism, but they do it differently.
Does that make sense? It's a strange nuance to be making, I'm not sure if it's helpful, but I just thought I'd try throwing that out there.
But yes, absolutely, transaction fees are partly intended to prevent spam. They're also partly intended as an incentive to the miners (currently far less than the block rewards; more intended for once the block rewards are insignificant).
Another anti-spam/flooding mechanism bitcoin has are the anti-dust rules. I don't remember the specifics but there's a penalty for doing "too small" of transactions, even if the fee was the same, which is a little odd to me but was put in there because of something about how the dice sites operated and did a lot of dust transactions.

@_date: 2015-05-31 03:08:55
Aye, I can totally understand that perspective.
I'm heavily divested into altcoins, so I'm pretty unconcerned. If bitcoin goes ahead and tries a hardfork, cool. If it doesn't, cool. I think cryptocurrencies as whole will muddle through.
By comparison, on the little altcoin that I've been mostly focusing on, right now we're going through a phase where we often are hitting 12+ hour gaps between blocks despite a 1-minute target, because of very inconsistent hash rates. And we're growing through it (in fact, it's a side-effect of going from ~worthless to valuable enough to mine intermittently).
I think these systems are far more resilient than people expect because of the determination of the people behind them to make them work. Frankly, I think bitcoin will survive and thrive whether or not it increases the blocksize in the immediate future.
@_date: 2015-05-09 07:54:00
Ah, well at least I finally understand what your particular breed of insanity is. Right, I don't expect congestion either (as in, I expect people to be rational and find ways of routing and prioritizing intelligently), and I expect that transaction fees and multiple blockchains will be more than enough for things to work out.
Yes, if demand exceeds supply, some people will be unsatisfied. C'est la vie. Of course, since we have an essentially unlimited supply in reality, I'm not losing any sleep over it.

@_date: 2015-05-09 02:15:35


By bitcoin fanatics, yes.


Except to decrease transaction costs or to support a larger base.


Except that, while it's not a permanent solution, it can provide all the capacity growth of going to 20Mb and more, and without any need for a fork. And, as mentioned, all of the ideas for how to scale can be tested without risking the main network.


Except that being cheaper to transact doesn't guarantee a stronger store of value. There could be 20 viable altcoins which have lower transactions costs, and yet still be bitcoin with a market cap and stability in value beyond any of them.
I'm perfectly aware everyone here has already decided that it's impossible for anything other than bitcoin to have any value whatsoever ever, just like everyone else has already decided it's impossible for bitcoin to ever have any value. You're all wrong.

Ooh, that's a cool idea. That could probably be done with a specially forked client. Normal clients wouldn't connect to it, modified clients could connect to normal nodes as normal or to the special nodes and there would be a new protocol for the fees list or negotiating / confirming payment or whatever. I don't see any reason why a premium-node system would require any core changes, although of course that would be nicer to make it standardize eventually.
But it seems like it would make sense to try something like that out separately first since it could work like that.

"physically identical"? There's nothing physical here.
The networks have different demand. Sometimes people don't want to dick around with your offbrand X to save 5 cents in transaction fee. Sometimes people just want gold, because you're buying property, not gum, so your silver isn't of interest right now.
Why would anyone ever use a $100 bill when there are $1 bills? Why would anyone use a Canadian Dollar if there are US Dollars? Why would the Deutsche Mark still hold value when there are Euros?

That's not the impression I get from the typical supporter. The impression I get is that they think that bitcoin will be utterly destroyed if this isn't done asap. I think that's just as ridiculous of a position, but it's sort of the opposite side.
I haven't seen many posts that actually are that euphoric about it. People more seem to feel they have no choice than that it's a great opportunity.
It's all very strange to me. As much buttcoin talks about the cult-like atmosphere here, it's very doomsday on both sides. When, in my opinion, it doesn't matter whether the limit is or isn't raised, bitcoin will continue to lead the cryptocurrencies.
All roads lead to moon.
@_date: 2015-05-31 09:51:29


You contradict yourself. This acknowledges that miners have a choice.
If &gt;-50% isn't on the new fork, and the new system is backwards compatible, then the old chain will consistently override it and the miners on the new chain will consistently lose their block rewards.
I'm actually not sure entirely how things work if you've been working on a chain that becomes out-distanced. I think it would result in undoing things that had happened during that time. So, for instance, someone sent you 1 BTC on the new chain. But, ooops, the old chain caught up and got longer because it had 60% of the hash power and the new client is backwards compatible. And so now you *didn't* get sent that 1 BTC. Further, if that 1 BTC had resulted from a block reward on the new chain, then the person who sent it to you doesn't even have it anymore. Ooops.
So miners do have a choice. They have a veto power. There's a good article on this topic (I think it was on medium.com) which I was linked to yesterday; I can find it again if anyone would like.
The only way to prevent this possibility would be to make the new client not backwards compatible.
But the old client has no ambiguity and will continue to operate and be stable. And there's a vocal minority which has declared that they will continue largely or exclusively on that chain. Personally, I plan to be on any and all bitcoin forks.
Edit: It looks like I was wrong. I wasn't aware of, or had forgotten, that the proposal requires 80% of mined blocks to show the new version. See [post]( it looks like this situation shouldn't happen because the switch won't happen until there's a supermajority of mined blocks. So unless the miners go crazy evil (vote as if they're on the new system, then mine the old system anyhow, and manage to get a majority on the old system that way despite 80% of blocks showing the new version), we should be safe.

[edit: Oh, never mind, you said off-chain, so you're being evil and supporting a third party ever controlling anything rather than an altcoin. Carry on. ;-p]
I think there's a lot of artificial urgency about all this though. So far I've seen no evidence the transaction rate is the major limiting factor for bitcoin. There are viable current workarounds (altcoins, particularly clonecoins), there is consensus for increasing the limit, and there is more visibility on this issue than any other.
Sure, handling more transactions will be critical eventually, but not today, and we're well enough covered to be able to continue for the foreseeable future. If we spike and get congested, then it will be more expensive to transact for a while. Free market economics: it's a good thing.
I'm sure there are various scalability issues, but similarly, I'm not aware of any imminent concern. Most people have no need to run a full node, and for those that do, it's not that crazy.
Bitcoin certainly has issues, but I think it's generally working fine and will continue to do so.

In seriousness, the alts do need bitcoin upstream to ultimately survive, but I honestly wouldn't mind if there was some forking drama up in bitcoin and a bunch of turbulence to go with it. I'm getting bored with all this 200-250 range. ;-)
@_date: 2015-05-10 07:06:21
Sure, but I think the 21 million hardcap is a pretty core idea that is part of the original pitch everyone gets for bitcoin, neh? I mean, to me that's a pretty critical component of its value. The only reason I can see for increasing it would be in order to reduce the value of the bitcoins (to allow more transactions), in which case, it's just another clonecoin.
"Bitcoin" I think will always be 21 million. That 'brand' requires it at this point.
But, sure, "never" is a long time. And it's certainly possible that bits will become the base unit people refer to or something like that which makes '21 million' less salient without actually changing anything.

Well, yes and no. Bitcoin was modeled on hashcash. The idea was actually to use computational difficulty to prevent spam emails. The bitcoin concept is sort of like trading what would have been analogous to stamps in that system.
So they weren't really doing fees per se. Instead, it was like a very low-difficulty version of mining which a person would do to make a "stamp", which iirc were thought of as one-time-use.
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:00:43
See [post]( it looks like this situation shouldn't happen because the switch won't happen until there's a supermajority of mined blocks. So unless the miners go crazy evil (vote as if they're on the new system, then mine the old system anyhow, and manage to get a majority on the old system that way despite 80% of blocks showing the new version), we should be safe.

Welcome to the free market. Figuring out how to do something useful before other people do and offering it as part of a product or service is business. If there weren't a profit to be gained from doing that, it wouldn't happen. This is how this is supposed to work.
And as demonstrated here, in fact, the (or one of the) first mover(s) are benefiting other merchants with their experience.
The idea of complaining that a business has an advantage for doing something right first is very funny and suggests a lack of understanding of what free market competition actually looks like, and the difference between that and a highly regulated "fair trade" type of market, which is what you would have to support if you don't want businesses to profit from their work.

@_date: 2015-01-08 22:14:48
But there also tend to be far fewer of those people than one would expect too. It's a small subset of programmers who have the time and inclination, and it's a subset of them who have the relevant domain knowledge (cryptographic review is particularly critical, and as can be seen in nullc's posts here alone, this is a totally different thing than just knowing how to make "hello world" appear with code; I thought I was good at math until I got to calculus. Then I had a good teacher and thought I could at least manage math. Then I hit number theory for a cryptography course and I realized I don't understand anything.).
Just because something is open source doesn't mean it's going to get a thorough and adequate review, which is nullc's point.
This needs to be understood so that the public will demand this and support developers who can do this. People need to be aware that there's significant effort required in this and a significant opportunity cost in not doing something else which will just pay them directly.
I'm being hypocritical in writing this rather than going and donating but I just wanted to tack on here to re-emphasize the point: review should not be taken for granted. "Open source" is not magic. If you don't know who the developers are, what they have done, what they think the current weaknesses are, etc., then you don't know how reliable the code is.
The is one of the major things that kept me out of bitcoin for years; I kept meaning to try to really read and understand the whitepaper thoroughly (still not done) and I kept meaning to read the code (still not done). And I knew that even with that, I wouldn't be able to fully understand the code, in particular because of the cryptography, and have assurance from my own knowledge that it was correct. So I just have to trust "it's worked so far; it'll probably keep working", but this is an argument from ignorance. The truth is, the more bitcoin grows, the more incentive there will be to find a vulnerability in it. And even if all of the math is entirely correct, the smallest quirk in implementation along the way can allow for vulnerabilities.
So we must remain vigilant and support our developers as best we can. We must prioritize technical correctness even at the cost occasionally of slower development otherwise or slightly lagging UX. We must make sure that the constant stories of "bitcoin got hacked" do not become accurate.
Because that has always been and still remains the greatest threat to the system in my opinion. If that happens, it will be very difficult to recover.
And there have been issues in the past. And people should study them and have a greater awareness of this to understand the importance and difficulty of getting everything exactly right. But so far, the system holds. Here's hoping it continues.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:41:59
The idea is third-party execution. That's what the "smart" contract is about: it's like a self-executing contract. So rather than rely upon you (or servers you control) to determine whether to execute runContract(), or the customer, or even a particular trusted third party, it's left to the blockchain.
So far they are actually quite limited in functionality and fairly complex to setup, but that's the concept. There is work in this direction on altcoins, and there's also talk about sidechains and etc. to support this.

That's correct. As has been stated elsewhere in this discussion, there are a *lot* of various policies and interpretation that gets involved. Just the procedures can be intimidating for sure. But it's a generally useful process.
The tutorial gandhi linked is absolutely a good start. It mostly focuses on formatting issues though, and those are relatively straightforward.
The "Keep in Mind" section starts to go into the policies:
* NPOV - neutral point of view: your edits must be neutral
* Verifiable - cite all the things; learning proper citation can be a trick too
* No original research - sort of a corollary to above; if you can't find a source for it, you can't say it just because you think or know it to be true
* Assume good faith - this can be hard, but basically, you must assume everyone's trying to make the best possible article, and they must assume that about you
Not mentioned as clearly in the tutorial (only in the five pillars link) but things I think are also important are:
* [Be bold]( - If you think there should be a change, you often should just make it. If you're wrong, you'll be reverted.
* [DON'T REVERT WAR]( - This is very important. If you make a change and someone else undoes it, go to the talk page, do *not* just change it back.
Edit: Also, last but not least: [Ignore all rules]( Wikipedia is like a game of [nomic]( turned into an encyclopedia.
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:40:02
Mob rule doesn't go against the economy. "Demand" is another term for mob rule. The point is just being made that there's constantly such decisions being made and the agreement of "the mob" (the people, one might alternately say) is what determines the rules.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:03:07
Thinking about it further, the closest I can come is blockchain technology: the computational results are verifiable although the actual processing isn't. There could be a miner which has some cheating algorithm, but if they don't actually hit the conditions to trigger it during the section in question, then it's not in the blockchain and the blockchain itself is still fine.
There are still nuances like cheats such as "ignore any attempt to spend/vote by Alice" which would not be detectable by examination of the blockchain alone. But there are at least certain verifiable properties.
So...blockchain all the things. But yeah, keep voting on paper-and-pencil for anything that actually matters.

Well, fuck. You caught me. I'm not really sure I have either. Just kinda started off being snarky and you got to the logical conclusion.
Umm...let's see if I can find something quickly.
Of course the first stuff that comes up are those bullshit things, the little "malware testers" and such. Just a "this website isn't currently sending you trojans (we thinkg); awesome!" Not what we're looking for. And various stuff about checking SSL, which again is not our scope.
Lots of various pen-testing sorts of stuff, but nothing that really does any sort of auditing / formal verification types of techniques.
Lots and lots and lots of stuff that claims to do something like this, none of which at a glance seems to do anything like what we're talking about.
I mean, I've been thinking about the problem off-and-on since we started this thread and it's been making me even less optimistic as it pulls together lots of strings of thought that have occurred to me before.
Like: let's suppose, hypothetically, a formal code review has been done on all of a website's code and it's found to be secure. That's already a pretty hand-wavey "and then a miracle" happens type of thing. But let's go for it for now. And let's imagine that there was a way that the OS and everything on the box was somehow verified and determined to be secure (and ignoring issues like a hardware vulnerability somewhere or it running inside of an undetectable container which is compromised, etc).
So we've got a secure machine and secure code. Now how the fuck can we possibly verify that this is what's actually running when we connect to a website at some point in time?
We can't do thinks like the deterministic build approaches, because by definition the code is running elsewhere. I feel like I've vaguely heard ideas along these lines, but never read into anything or understood an idea that could prove it. Any sort of check is inherently secondary and could be faked: like a challenge-response type of thing to supposedly "prove" it's the machine we think it is, I can't think how that could actually, prove-ably fail if the machine / code has been tampered with in any way.
Not to mention all of the various possible issues external to that system itself, like SSL signing chain vulnerabilities, or MITM or etc.
I found an [interesting paper]( which talks about some of these sort of issues, but it takes the typical approach of verifying that code is secure. But how to determine that's actually the code running remotely?
Another [interesting paper]( talks about secure systems, yet once again, (at least at my very quick glance), it seems like this is a way to build a secure system, but how to prove that secure system is running?
When I started writing this response, I hoped to be able to end with "although I can't find any example of a website that can do this, it is at least possible for a website to be provably secure." Now I doubt that claim. Code, theoretically, can be "proven secure." Maybe, at an even further stretch, a particular machine's hardware and OS and software could all be "proven" to be secure. But how can it be authenticated? Sure, we can install a key onto there, and have all output signed by it, and say "look, we know it's coming from that secure computer", but this isn't really proof of security, as it still is a bit circular, and even if we grant all of those proofs, and trust the person who installed the key (there's no way to prove a particular key was generated within a given system, right? So we just have to trust that it wasn't imported from somewhere else with another copy on a vulnerable / attack system), we haven't really proven what we're looking for.
There are ways to increase security. And it's possible to know there are vulnerabilities. But yeah, I guess I no longer believe it's possible to prove that a given website is actually secure. ;-(
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:20:48
Aye. As far as I'm concerned, this shows that there is no problem. We *do* have dynamically changing transaction fees (the user can change their transaction fees to whatever they like) and that worked perfectly. Boom. No problem.
Sure, it'll be good to get the larger block sizes for future growth in capacity, but it's clear that transactions that need to go through will go through (because they'll put a sufficient fee on).

They would if they could, but presumably the exchanges will be very clear about what chain they're on and one of them will become worthless pretty quickly.
I just learned recently that the proposal is the fork doesn't start until 80% of the last 1000 blocks are showing the version supporting it. At that point, the fork should go as smoothly as it can.
Presumably, the market for bitcoin classic would be lower and bitcoin-big would have most of the value of the original bitcoin, or a bit more.
But yes, if you could sell both coins for anywhere above half of the previous value, then presumably that would be a logical move.

I've seen similar behavior by faucet or dice output before, using one large output and making a lot of payments from it.
I'm not certain, but I think perhaps it might help for priority from having a larger UTXO? I'm not sure if that's a significant factor with the constant spends like that but I wonder if that's how some of the original logic got coded.

It's not just that. That's like the printing presses to make paper money, or the banking system which allows digital USD.

It also reminds me of the [BitMarmot]( which is fundamentally an idea which captures the underlying spirit well, even though his critique gets the math wrong.

Question about how this works in practice. If one attempts to broadcast such a transaction before it's valid, will the network relay it? If not, then some node needs to be waiting to send it once it's valid, right? If it is broadcast before it's valid, then it has to wait in the mempool for a month and not get bumped out from rising fees in the meantime, right?

Right, but this is a perfect example of why each has their own niche. DOGE is great for fast transactions where you don't really care that much about security. BTC is great for high value transactions where you don't care about waiting a little bit (whether for transaction propagation or for blocks). Each is useful. Each complements the other.
The "nothing matters except BTC" worldview ignores the fact that bitcoin is more useful because of the prior existence of gold, silver, etc and euros, dollars, etc. and the current existence of ltc, doge, etc. than it would be if the entire world were bitcoins and nothing else.

They like to play both sides of it. When it's convenient, "we don't need to hard fork now because we can quickly do it later if it turns out we need to", and then can just turn around quickly to "hard forks need overwhelming consensus and pre-planning in order to get them right [so let's never do one ever]" when that's more convenient.
There was plenty of time to do BIP101, and soft cap consensuses and orphaning should have made it perfectly feasible to raise the hard cap like that. Instead, some critical people did everything they could, successfully, to torpedo any and all hard fork proposals. And they still act like whenever they want to hard fork, they'll be able to do it without a problem. Maybe. I wonder if at some point their own  rhetoric will have sunk in so deep Bitcoin just is incapable of ever hard forking again, so divided someone would always hold out on veto.
Perhaps not. I do think whenever Core finally suggests the inevitable hard fork to remove the 1MB cap, everyone will be so beyond ready to go for it that it won't be an issue and will in fact go through easily. But for pure schadenfreude, it would amuse me if Core couldn't get consensus for a 2MB increase when they finally decided they couldn't wait any longer and tried it.

I'm pretty agnostic as I said, but aye, that's certainly consistent with the arguments I've been hearing. I think there's a very good argument that 3-4 transactions per second excludes mass adoption.

Much more viable with the assistance of someone who has access to moderator logs. ;-)
But that code runs without that access; it just monitors for removals. It's not open source (at least last time I paid attention), but the moderators may help out a bit. It actually works based on monitoring top thread iirc, so it's already possible for popular enough threads to appear on there theoretically. It misses threads which are removed before they become popular though.
Basically, people want a view like you had a screencap of, where they can see the removed spam.

Well, that would be what importing a private key would mean, sure. I haven't heard of doing that before, so let me try a quick google on it.
An [old answer]( on the topic suggests you can't import private keys in Coinbase.
So the real question is: what makes you think you can import a private key into Coinbase? If you can, then, yes, it would seem like what you're describing should work. 
[This more recent source from Coinbase]( suggests just sweeps are possible, which isn't really a "true" import in the sense that what you describe in the title (later sends) wouldn't presumably be automatically caught.
I've seen coinbase employees sometimes respond here though, so there's some chance this'll work. Alternately, might just try sending the question to support...

On the other hand, 99.995% of humanity doesn't currently have a burning need to modify the bitcoin ledger each day. The counter-argument to Gavin's proposal by the other devs isn't to never increase the blocksize. It's that doing it immediately is not necessary and has significant tradeoffs.
Which is fine. I'd like to see Gavincoin come out, personally. But I plan to keep using bitcoin classic as well if so.

Right. One way to help mitigate this and also address the security concern listed here is to create a new address to receive each payment. So your wallet is in your control (no one is able to just paste over), you generate an address for the ticket, label it with the ticket id or whatever quickly, show the QR code to customer (not just posting it; in control of "send it here" interaction with the customer, and they can't claim "oh, I already sent it" (or if they did, it's immediately obvious to you at least it's a scam if someone posted a notice on your truck claiming "send coins to 1stealerXXXX to prepay!")), and then you should see an incoming payment along with the id of what ticket it's for.

Hm, that's a point.

I mean, the miners have a lot of sunk cost in the hardware. If bitcoin were to die, that hardware is worthless.

And thus is created value for Bitcoin classic and thus bitcoin classic will never die.
You've probably said this elsewhere, perhaps even this thread, but I just found this comment from your history and was curious: so are you opposed to expanding the block size? Or just Gavin's plan? Or any hard forks in general?
@_date: 2016-03-04 11:32:10
It is extremely clear that he's talking about the cost to make an entire valid block packed with selected expensive-to-validate transactions. The cost for making such a block is approximately the block reward of the block, because it is extremely likely to be orphaned.
He has specifically addressed that it is far cheaper to do a spam attack instead.
But feel free to use your lack of reading comprehension as evidence to confirm your bias, already in progress.

In my view, altcoins could be the solution here. Let's say there's an altcoin with an at least stable exchange value versus BTC and a small spread. Then for "retail" types of transactions, that could be used, while for larger transactions bitcoin is used.
How would the altcoins be able to handle the load? There are a lot of them, many with very little stored so far. They can be upgraded piecemeal to newer schemes for handling higher load without risking the backbone (bitcoin). And they're "on blockchain", so the exchange risk is the issue but not centralized control over individual transactions.
It's not about blockchain vs private company. It's about how to use many blockchains most effectively.
This already is the case: microtransactions on blockchain don't make sense in bitcoin because it's too valuable. Fractions of a cent in value are currently handled by third parties or altcoins. I expect this concept will scale. This is similar to not using gold to represent change from a $20.
I think what you're missing as well is that this isn't some sort of imminent thing. This is about what will happen as inflation ends and values rise. And of course, there may well be some transition pains as well...

Yes, after a fork there are two separate chains. So you now have two separate coins and so you can send one coin to one place and the other to a different one.
Cold storage is unaffected. A wallet taken out of that cold storage should work on either client (presuming there was a split between the two; but realistically, if it's really cold storage, when taking it out there will only be one active Bitcoin chain).


Good questions.

Bitcoin now has 82.5% of the cryptocurrency marketcap listed on coinmarketcap. Less than a year ago it was still at or above 88%. I had previously predicted that if Bitcoin continued on Core's stated course, Bitcoin's market cap could fall below 75% of the cryptocurrency marketshare in 2016 as people fled to available capacity. At this point that looks to me like a fairly likely outcome.
At what point would you worry that perhaps the lack of capacity in Bitcoin has stalled growth? Stagnant price for another year? Market cap below 75%? Market cap below 50%? Losing the first position?
Don't worry, you're getting your divorce, constantly. Bitcoin is bleeding value because it's explicitly said "fuck you" to growing capacity and has embraced the most extreme possible conception of the fee market. Telling people for years if they had any suggestion or concern "well fuck off to an ~~alt~~shitcoin then! hahaha!"
Be glad; you've "won", until the Chinese miners lose enough money they finally say fuck you back to Core. Which could finally come in the next year or two. But in the meantime, you've got your cripplecoin and should bask in the glory of managing to prevent Bitcoin from growing.

At first I was thinking this was wrong but then I thought about it more and realized that you're probably right: if there's nothing in Gavincoin to prevent backwards compatibility after they switch to 20Mb, and they don't have the majority of the hashing power, then sure enough, when it outruns the 20Mb fork, that'll go poof. Interesting. They would have to deliberately prevent backwards compatibility to prevent that from being a possibility.
Of course, it wouldn't work the other way around since the old client would reject the 20Mb blocks. At first, I thought that would be the same for the new one, but then I realized as stated that it could actually allow for this.
I know you already know this; just reacting "aloud".


[iterated]( I was wrong: I had thought equilibrium in iterated was cooperate, but actually, that's just how humans actually behave often but is against game theory. But in this case, we don't have a fixed and known number of rounds, so I think this is one of the cases where by game theory it's correct to cooperate.
Doesn't mean it'll happen though, and always risky trying to overgeneralize from toy problems.

And in fact, there are altcoins which do this iirc, demonstrating that is simply wrong to claim that it is not possible. Notably, the key word here is "resistant". As he said in his comment, it's about the cost-effectiveness of very specialized hardware design work. If the algorithm in question won't be relevant by the time the hardware is built, then clearly asic resistances has been obtained.
This is analogous to a claim that "bullet resistant is impossible" when what is actually true is "bulletproof is impossible".

The idea is that holding the currency is itself an economic incentive to run a full node, if the network is short of full nodes.
I haven't seen evidence of this scarcity so far, either.
I think it's more important to have a few consistent nodes than a lot of nodes, but by either metric, I certainly don't see bitcoin having a problem in this regard.

I am not a lawyer and my knowledge of IP law is weak, but I thought prior art was relevant to the question of whether other people can use a trademark.
Generally, a trademark is a weaker form of protection which more protects the company's right to use the phrase / concept than it does prohibit everyone else from using it. Others are then prevented from using it in the exact same way as the company.
Again, just saying my understanding as a layperson.
So my understanding of how the prior art would work is that if there were prior art showing that the phrase had been used in substantially the same way it's being used now, then it would not be an infringement upon the company's trademark.
By contrast, if they really had invented the phrase and its use and then someone was misrepresenting it, then I believe they could sue. But I think the prior art, while not necessarily invalidating the trademark entirely, does make it much more difficult to use the trademark to sue anyone.
Moot point given that they're saying now they aren't suing anyone, but just trying to see if I'm at all on the right track on how trademarks work. :-)

There's a lot of drama about increasing the blocksize. Proponents say we need this or bitcoin will die from not being able to support enough transactions. Opponents say that it will make running a full node cost prohibitive. Both sides have some legitimate points. Neither is right that the world will end.
Gavin has proposed implementing the larger blocksize in Bitcoin-XT (a currently-compatible bitcoin fork) with a mechanism for it to be triggered if enough people adopt that client (so it would behave normally until then).
If you went away and came back in a year, the issue should be resolved and fine imo. If you watch throughout, you're likely to see a lot of drama.

The question of whether this is spending bitcoin is about as interesting as the question of whether submarines swim, to borrow a phrase.
I do not know, and am merely making a wild guess here, but I would think that they charge the merchants a fee on accepting their card like most of the cards do. If so, then there still would be an incentive for merchants to switch to accepting BTC directly (even through a 1% BTC payment processor) compared to typical card networks. I really doubt the merchants are suddenly getting 0% fee on that transaction just because the origin of the card's money was BTC.


I really think this is backwards and I don't know why it seems obvious to so many people. I think the question of BTC as a store of value is not particularly related to how easily it can be spent, at least not anymore. That battle is over, and it's been won. If you can't see that this card is part of that, that's fine.
At this point, I think the questions BTC should resolve in order to gain more value and be a stronger store of value have to do with its growth in the future. BTC has a good network effect started and if allowed to carry on with that should do well. I think the biggest challenge is simply to enable more demand by allowing more throughput capacity, which is currently the limiting factor in my never humble and decidedly inexpert opinion.
@_date: 2016-01-24 20:25:09
I've heard that argument before but I'll certainly try to check it out again. Block size cap as a DoS defense only works against malicious miners. It doesn't do anything to stop massive amounts of transactions coming in and filling mempool, and yeah, that's generally going to be a bigger problem.

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.


One would hope a lawsuit like this could be done as a contingency class action where the legal expenses could be collected from the defendants as part of the settlement or judgment. If the suit must be paid by the plaintiffs, it may be cost-prohibitive. [Edit: This is basically what you said: the effects are divided up based on size of account. Just saying that ideally the cost to be paid initially and directly is relatively low and most of the legal fees are based upon winning.]
I do think a class action lawsuit here makes sense and is worth talking to a lawyer about.
On a practical level, as far as I know, a lot of the obscure altcoins are still paying out (I've only used one in particular myself but as far as I know the majority of the coins listed are technically working). BTC, LTC, and DOGE have all been reported to get stuck on withdraw, along with others. For those who have funds there, I would suggest considering whether it's worth taking a loss (at least if selling immediately, and even otherwise, paying a premium for buying with CryptsyBTC rather than BTC on a solvent exchange) to buy alternatives on Cryptsy and withdraw them while you can rather than waiting on legal action to try to resolve a claim against whatever is left.
Edit: I hadn't thought about the amount you mention. Just the initial legal fees are likely to be more than what you have on there. This class action should be initiated by someone with a lot of stuck coins to make it worth their while.

So in your view, if bitcoin hardforks, there will continue to be trading on "bitcoin classic" and "bitcoin 2.0"? We'll have one chain with 1Mb blocks and another with XXMb blocks, with interesting differences thus on transaction fees.
Basically, the new bitcoin would be like a clonecoin of the original and trade alongside it in your view?
@_date: 2015-05-31 13:42:15
I'm of the opinion that 51% is more theoretical than practical. It's never really scared me too much. In the clonecoin I'm most into, it would be pretty easy for someone to get 51%, at least for significant stretches of time. But frankly, that would be better than what we often have, which is a difficulty spike and then a long time until the next block; at least a 51% would sort of imply some consistent hashing. It's a concern, but it's rather down on the list in my opinion.
Yeah, if bitcoin loses massive value, then the overall market will be way down, for sure. But if bitcoin totally died, someday another cryptocurrency would still rise, and it could well be one of the current alts. It would definitely be a grim few years though.

Is it possible that accounts with little prior history might be active if the blockchain actually started getting full? And that people who are on the peripheral of the community might be more likely to make a mistake at first that leads to taking longer for confirmation?
Maybe you're right and it's all bullshit and there is no one waiting. I have no idea but I know there's been hyperbole before. But sometimes it's not as simple as "little prior history" implies "must be lying if they claim there's a problem".
What I found on a tiny clonecoin was that there are people, some of the best in our community, who only speak up if there's a problem. People are busy sometimes.
Again, not saying you're wrong necessarily about submissions to But hypothetically, what would it take to convince you that the blocks were full with "legitimate" transactions? Is it a certain fee level? Certain trusted users having a hard time getting a transaction through? Only if you have a transaction stuck?

*sigh* There's a lot of pretty borderline incoherent nonsense here.
No, of course Bitcoin isn't "destined" to fall anymore than it's destined to take over the entire world.
You seem to claim both that block size and block rate are the only things that could cause another coin to gain on BTC, and then you also claim that they don't matter. Both are obviously false.
The idea that there's a critical flaw in 1 minute block times that hasn't been revealed because those coins aren't as popular as Bitcoin is cargo cult bullshit. It doesn't remain to be seen if 10-minute blocks is the "correct choice" because the idea that there is one perfect block rate is similarly asinine. The idea the block rate is "only a technicality" similarly reveals a terminal lack of thinking. The fact that more things than block rate matter appears to be the only coherent thought you managed to convey here.
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:00:10
I believe this is the key shift in incentives. We focus on talk about deflation versus inflation, but the core reason for the different choices is that the "sovereign currencies" are run by major debtors (loosely speaking; separate entities but central banks can't afford to bankrupt their governments I don't think), and so they *need* sufficiently weak currencies to be able to keep paying, without being so weak they become Zimbabwe.
By contrast, cryptocurrencies are basically run by stakeholder owners. Their incentive is to increase the price of the assets they own.
I expect that this effect will lead to cryptocurrencies in general outperforming fiat currencies for a means of storing wealth, although there will continue to be massive fluctuations in the years to come on the road there.

NYAN withdraws have been working at Cryptsy normally for this whole time and I've been saying that. Cryptopia now lists NYAN as well, so if you don't want to setup your own NYAN wallet you could just send over there.
Cryptsy added the bullshit 0.5% withdraw fee, and they sometimes can't handle that large of a withdraw in a single transaction (I would suggest withdrawing in five one million NYAN chunks), but NYAN withdraw has been working while BTC, LTC, and DOGE (and many more) stopped working, first for large then for all withdraws.
Apparently most people aren't in a rush to withdraw their NYAN nor is there a massive demand for buying NYAN as an exit. But it will probably keep working until the very end I think, whenever that comes.
I have all except for a last 2 mBTC off of Cryptsy. I left a bit of dust there to be able to keep testing it now and then, and as a tip for the comedy value of Cryptsy.

Because some people can walk and chew gum at the same time. Besides, I thought the Core narrative was that the "spam attack" didn't matter?
Bitcoin needs to grow capacity if it wants to be able to grow capacity. Despite the hysteria and attacks of your side, the only reason a 2MB hardfork could possibly be a risk is precisely because of the unreasonable and unwarranted stonewalling while has been going on. And it's ironic, because all this rhetoric will flip back around in six months, a year, whenever Core finally admits that a 2MB hardfork is necessary and overdue.
The fix is trivially available to anyone. I find attacking a basic, fundamental improvement like this pretty low, even by the already low standards of Why is SegWit loaded with bullshit would be a far more apt question, but I don't ask it, because I find rhetorical questions typically pointless outside a healthy Socratic exchange.
Really, are you going to claim CPU exhaustion doesn't matter if block size increases? It's a valuable change in the current system; it becomes more important if block size were increases.
He could be very legitimately critiqued if he wasn't addressing issues like this. But instead, your rhetoric manages to frame a proposed technical improvement to attack an attack vector, as if it were a made-up concern.

I'm a huge proponent of the notion that the most serious issues Bitcoin has right now are community and political in nature.
But even so, I think it's a silly claim that the fork is *only* political and thus nothing to do with the blocksize. It's like claiming the US Civil War had *nothing* whatsoever to do with slavery in any way shape or form. It's political, but it has a subject. The political subject of the US Civil War was slavery. The political subject of these hard fork attempts is the blocksize.
That's your objection to increasing the blocksize, the fact that it requires people to agree and thus sets a dangerous precedent? You believe the Bitcoin civilization will be destroyed by a hypothetical agreement to do a 2MB fork?

Perhaps there should be an official proposal for a version bit to show support without casting a vote in favor? Fifth most significant bit in version?

But remember, my core point is that if Bitcoin-new is backwards compatible and Bitcoin-old has the majority of the hashing power, then in the long run, there is not Bitcoin-new; it will always keep resetting to Bitcoin-old, and so the risk is in fact on the side of Bitcoin-new.
The fact is, none of us really knows which way this would turn out. There is risk to miners on either fork, regardless of what anyone says, because of that. Either, both, or neither fork could become worthless. And certainly, from that perspective, the miners don't have control.
But for deciding which chain will win, again, if Bitcoin-new is not make backwards incompatible, then the miners *will* be deciding whether a Bitcoin-new client ultimately ends up seeing these larger blocks and having them stay there, or if the only thing which it will see in the long-run are Bitcoin-old blocks.
Edit: So, for instance, in your example, mining Bitcoin-old would still create Bitcoin-new coins at the point when the Bitcoin-old chains are the longest. So mine on Bitcoin-old and sell on Bitcoin-new would work in your example. Of course, the miner could also choose to mine on Bitcoin-new and just sell from there, but what if 60% of the mining power were on Bitcoin-old? Then that Bitcoin-new block reward will not be able to be spent, and one would have to mine on Bitcoin-old even if one wanted Bitcoin-new coins.
Edit 2: See my edit to my first post here. Because we require 80% of blocks to show the new version before switching, this situation of having the fork but still having 60% on the old chain shouldn't happen.

Best of luck to you! I hope to see in your update that you had no issues with this in practice. :-)
I suspect that like counterfeit money, it's always going to be with us, but generally small enough that it doesn't stop commerce. 
Your plan of checking for a miner's fee (excellent idea), is basically a single heuristic zero-conf solution. You were asking about the benefits of a merchant provider: this is a core area. They handle doing zero-conf, having systems to try to detect with even more sophistication double spend attempts, and covering the loss if it does happen.
I think it'll be a good exercise to do it manually yourself first, see how it goes, and then decide if you want to use one. They generally charge a flat fee of 1% of the payment if I recall correctly, which could be worth it for the convenience or if you had problems with zero-conf. You'll definitely understand how that works far better after having done it yourself though. :-)
And for what it's worth, I don't have a mobile wallet myself (no smartphone), but if I did, I wouldn't scam you. My friends and family wouldn't scam you. Some of the people I've known would if they could, but I don't think most of them know how yet. Another few years perhaps. Because of what's important to us for all of them. The people I respect and I are not starving and have our pride and do not want to be a thief. We prefer to work honestly for what we get. I think a lot of people do, and that is a big part of "social capital" and why the world manages to work at all.
Now, of course, no one's perfect. But I do like to think that in general most people don't steal because they prefer not to steal, from some type of guilt/shame/pride perspective.

Oh, gotcha, thanks! Sorry, I'd misunderstood what you meant; I thought you were speaking against the hard forking mechanism rather than the "Consider.it".
For what it's worth, my impression was that the votes there would be advisory, but I'll admit I never even went to the main page, I just looked at the vote interface. I agree it would be a questionable decision to make such votes binding.
I think it's still pretty early in Bitcoin's growth to be so scared of a quite low-risk change (if there are issues, a soft-cap at 1MB can easily remain or be reinstated if necessary). Removing signatures from the block is not an optimization for any nodes that verify signatures and it's not the only way to do a transaction malleability fix.
I don't think this is rushing things by any means. The discussion has been going on for years in the technical community and months at the least in the broader Bitcoin community.

As far as I can see, you're the last major figure who's made any attempt to take both sides seriously. As such, your opinion is especially interesting to me.
My expectation is that Core will continue to win by default in crippling Bitcoin's growth. Anyone who wants cryptocurrency to scale on blockchain will be forced to leave Bitcoin. Over the next couple years, Bitcoin will lose its lead in the cryptocurrency market cap, just as it has already gone from above 90% to about 78% currently.
If Bitcoin loses the lead as a result of years of refusing to allow any meaningful growth, would you consider that a rejection of Core's policy? Would there be any point at which you would consider their actions to be a mistake or in bad faith?
Or does the Assume Good Faith mentality extend even to crippling Bitcoin so much that it loses its status as reserve cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2016-01-31 14:02:43
I don't think Bitcoin will ever increase its block rate. If you think the block size debate is vociferous, just imagine how that would be. There are other coins which offer it. I just think it's amusing because from the Bitcoin community one can hear things about how 1-minute block times are not workable because of orphaning rates, while other coins have operated for years with 1-minute block times.
For a higher block cap, yeah, maybe it will someday. But the 10-minute block time means it's operating at somewhat of a disadvantage. To even match the throughput of DOGE, BTC would need a 10MB block size.
When a computer scientist speaks formally about "scaling", they almost exclusively mean asymptotic complexity. As far as that goes, everything's in about the same boat. But what most people mean when they talk about "scale" is basically capacity / throughput. From that perspective, Bitcoin clearly trails behind basically everything at this point.
Now, it's routinely pointed out that there will be some limit to throughput, and sure, there's going to be only so much that can be done at some point. But BTC's current throughput is pretty laughable and I think it's pathetic that the "other side" pretends there's seriously danger from increasing it.
I don't think BTC needs to be retail, but this push for the "settlement layer" mindset is the complete other end of the spectrum wrong. BTC has been touted as having the good aspects of cash / gold. Those don't have a limit to how many people around the world can be trading them at one time. It doesn't cost money to give someone a gold coin.

That's FSS-RBF, but that wasn't exciting enough, and like this post shows, fuck zero-conf because it's not perfect, so then they added "opt-in" (for sender) RBF so that outputs can be changed.
The next step, with the groundwork of having denied that zero-conf could ever work or have any value (proven by theft, ignoring the overwhelming majority of successful uses), and having already implemented "opt-in" RBF is to go full scorched-earth and make it so that double spends exactly as done here will be considered how the network is expected to perform.
Don't like an unconfirmed transaction you sent? Just re-spend it!
Zero conf on Bitcoin is being deliberately destroyed by the trolls of Core, because after all, given that it had weak security anyhow, and competes with the vaporware LN, it clearly has no place in the future of Bitcoin.

The whole point of the word "resistant" is that it can be overcome but still, well, resists.
An algorithm which changes every six months (or whatever) is resistant, because it significantly reduces the advantage that an ASIC could have.

Third one is just a link back to here, and I don't think the parent comment addressed that, but I appreciate the first two. Thanks; you're right, I should have read the rest of the thread.
Certainly I agree having the protocol open-source is important and valuable and appreciated.
But unless someone has stepped up to say they're going to actually run that system, and if they have I have missed it, then it seems obvious that there still needs to be work done to replace it.
It seems pretty obvious that a system that isn't going to be run anymore and is external to the core system shouldn't be relied upon as a reason to be able to avoid making core improvements.
It's great that the work was done and allowed the system to get to where it is now. But I strongly disagree with your "only interesting to 1%" argument. It ignores the fact that this is the most important 1%.
Putting these improvements into core doesn't mean making it part of the protocol as you imply. Other clients are free not to do so, but, again, I don't see how a deprecated external system can be used as the reason to not include it yourself.


This entire section presumes an incredibly restricted definition of what block relay improvements mean, clearly. Certainly I would consider transaction messaging to be integrally related work, but that's really pointless semantics. Whatever you call those bandwidth improvements, I think it's clear it belongs in core if there are clear improvements.
Certainly I can understand rejecting any particular proposal. But, for instance, what would be the argument against including the 'fast block relay protocol' in core? If you want to encourage protocol diversity, then why not support multiple protocols rather than just ignoring it and saying you want people to make lots of options?


This is a complete false dilemma. Nothing about having more performant block propagation in core would prevent experimentation by experts on the side. That is exactly what one would expect and is great work. The suggestion is merely to adopt these at some point.
Block propagation affects everyone, albeit in different ways. Sane defaults are always going to be important. Having the basic setup be capable of doing as much relaying as efficiently as it can seems like a basic principle. And, again, nothing about that stops an individual from running their own version. In fact, it makes it easier to have a base to work from in adding modifications.


We have reached the point where the current stated backbone of block relaying is stated to be deprecated, haven't we? What's the stated solution to that? Again, I'm sure you've said it previously, but I really haven't read anything further on the topic since seeing mentions of the initial notice that the current servers were no longer going to be supported.
If the core nodes aren't considered to perform at least that well and be able to act as replacements for such a system, then it just seems to me like such a safe and convenient solution to bundle it with the nodes as an option at least that I can't understand why block relaying could be considered to be an issue.
Of course, if the answer is that Core nodes already perform fine, or someone else is taking up the block relaying servers, or whatever the solution is, that would make sense. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm missing from, as you've said, code exists which solves this, so I don't understand why there would be a problem here. Easy answer would be simply "there isn't."


Yeah, I can totally understand that. I'm just very much on the (customizeable) monolithic side myself. If a person wants to build/install a lightweight version, that makes sense. But I like having a repo/installer which can get "all the features" if desired too. Like the Cygwin installer.

Certainly. Although given that it seemed to be a one-time thing, I wonder how much of an impact it had ultimately. But regardless, it still shows the general category of "things can go wrong" between initial support and actual activation.

I hadn't thought about it before, but this will actually be a proactive defense against deliberate double spend attempts too once in practice: a merchant could prophylactically increase the fee if they want to accept the transaction but are worried it won't confirm in a timely fashion. A customer might have deliberately put a low fee, trying to get zero-conf to go through and then resubmit, but their resubmit may not actually work then.
Of course, the customer would unjustly get a cheaper transaction fee in effect (since presumably they sent amount owed to merchant and too-small transaction fee, and merchant must spend additional fee out of their payment), but better than losing the whole payment.
And then there still would be the possibility of Scorched Earth race in bidding on the miner's fee before the confirmation...in theory, the Prisoner's Dilemma single-round solution would suggest to me that two strangers who will not meet again who are in this situation would basically end up converting the whole payment into a miner's fee ultimately. In practice, psychology suggests this effect would be limited (people aren't going to bother racing to give away the last bit if they won't get anything out of the last transaction; still might go as high as 80% or even higher), but still noticeable.
It would be interesting to see a legal case coming out of that situation...I think if properly decided customer would be liable for the transaction fees and the difference if not enough was sent to merchant account.

Beats $0. It's BTC, it's not like there's a huge market back of it yet. On a market cap of a few billion, moving a million around is something. Yeah, it's not impressive compared to any standard business. Grocery stores do a lot of volume on thin margins, but I don't know that indulging the apples-and-oranges comparison is particularly valuable.


I think you're right there. I think there probably has been a mismatch between the expectations of VC-funded BTC companies like Coinbase and the actual performance of the BTC economy so far.

No, I didn't miss that. I specifically suggested the proven protocol for that reason. And the part you quote is me saying precisely that experts should be deploying experiments in the real world! How do you quote me saying something and then condescend to tell me that exact point while telling me I missed the point? Why do I bother?


It sounds like you, as usual, don't bother reading what you respond to.
I made the point repeatedly that having the protocol is great, but it does nothing without servers running it. That is the opposite of conflating it. You are the one conflating it by acting like the existence of a protocol is the same as actually having people and servers dedicated to implement it.


Great! So we agree that block relaying isn't an issue and we can raise the blocksize cap finally!


Just seems like block relaying might be relevant to the reference implementation.


I worked so hard to say that adding code to a client != somehow making it part of the core consensus protocol. And there you go conflating it again!
And I nowhere suggested adding anything new or less effective, but you're still arguing against the new proposal rather than my question of why it would be bad to bundle the fast block relay system into core as an option given that it's real-world proven.

Sure, I won't argue that a shorter adjustment period is necessarily better. Although, personally, I think it's reasonable to do adjustments in a single block when there's a massive discrepancy: for Bitcoin for instance, I think a gap larger than, say, 6-12 hours would be a reasonable period to do at least some difficulty reduction.
But yeah, it's definitely tradeoffs. When someone asks whether there isn't any solution to a massive hashing reduction though, it's at least a possibility.
I don't believe there's anything inherently perfect in the fixed "two week" (forget the number of blocks offhand) adjustment period rather than even, say, a rolling window, anymore than I think that 1MB is somehow magically perfect.
I have personally experienced some of the issues that can result from massive fluctuations in hashing and have had occasion to be very glad to have a 1 block adjustment period.

Free transactions are still technically possible on Bitcoin, just very unusual these days. The community in this subreddit has changed over the last few years to a position that low fees, much less zero fee transactions, are no longer generally possible nor desirable.
There are altcoins which follow different approaches. In fact, I'm pretty sure no other coin has as high of fees as Bitcoin. I think Ethereum is the only other one which has even faced full blocks.
Obviously, then, fees alone do not determine value although they may be a factor.

Bitcoin's difficulty function is unchanged from when it was first created iirc. Other coins have different setups to allow for faster difficulty changes. But such a change on Bitcoin would require a hard fork. And Bitcoin is increasingly composed of only those who would never, ever hard fork. So...

No, that's simply delusional. I already covered that everything else needs users. But users need everything else too. Although I'm cheating slightly by defining a user as all of the people who aren't going to mine themselves or run an exchange or code their own coin. But there *is* that group out there, and it's the overwhelming majority.
And a single user is in fact feasible. Not, perhaps, in the long-term, or at least not ideal; but a single buyer can support a market for a while.

Thanks for the post! It's fun to see a mention.
The tipbot basically runs itself; it's quite easy. I don't know why more bitcoiners don't run tipbots. Seems like it should be something with a lot of different versions running around.
But the idea that cryptocurrency tipbots are dead is fortunately, nowhere near in sight so far as I see. There's plenty of good code out there to do it, and there are lots of coins which keep one running as a basic feature.
I thought there were still BTC supporting ones still running. Are there really none left or what? It's not hard to enable it on an altcoin one generally, but I like keeping it simple and keeping a bot to a single coin. I would have thought that there would at least be BTC support on some of the altcoin bots...

This discussion reminds me of [the scene with Varys and Tyrion about power.](
Yes, users can choose what they will use. But a typical user isn't going to write their own client, make their own exchange, or mine their own blocks. The developers, exchanges, and miners all need the users, but they also have influence themselves. The minimum viable configuration seems to be a miner, an exchange, and a buyer: a coin can survive without a developer for a period of time.
For a developer to have any influence, they must convince the others to use their code. For an exchange to matter, there must be users trading on it. For a miner to profit, an exchange must accept their blocks and have users buying the coin.
The user can go where they like, but they will still ultimately need at least an exchange and a miner, and they'll probably want a developer. Eventually, they'll probably want some fellow users as well...

Yeah, a lot of Buttcoin is low quality. But I don't really see the passion that you think you see. At its core, the goal really is just mining comedy gold.
But I started using Buttcoin because I found it to be the best source of news about Bitcoin. This subreddit is rather cancerous for a variety of reasons. The alternatives are largely devoted to insulting this subreddit. But Buttcoin generally picks out the most interesting stories, albeit the negative ones.
It's true that you have to dig a bit before you get to solid criticism, and I think even the best is flawed and could be responded to, but instead of doing that, the general reaction is to treat Buttcoiners as idiots. They are not. They are closer to the concept of "loyal opposition".
At some point in the next few weeks (hopefully sooner), I'm planning to write a piece responding to jstolfi's Ponzi interpretation of Bitcoin. But it won't be posted to this subreddit, nor to any other focusing on Bitcoin. It'll be posted to the subreddit for my adopted alt, and then xposted to Buttcoin a few days later for discussion.
In my view, this subreddit, and most of the Bitcoin "community", has shut itself out of the future of cryptocurrency by choosing to ignore all critics, and thereby missing the valuable perspective from Buttcoin along with all of the experiences of the alts.
I have no idea what the next leading cryptocurrency is going to be, and I think it'll still take a few years for it to pass Bitcoin's marketcap, but I do believe that Bitcoin's going to manage to piss away its lead.
Maybe not though. I've been wrong about most things so far in cryptocurrency (like thinking $5-$10 per unit sounded over-valued for a new currency). I'd be fine with being wrong now. From what I've seen though, if we ignore the layer of sarcasm, I think has a more realistic view than even though both are extremely biased and missing the truth.
I think the reality lies somewhere in the middle, but I haven't yet found any place which seems closer to it, so I've tried to use my spare time to present my own view of the future. Which is a great thing about adopting a near-dead alt: you get a platform for making the change you want to see in the world. :-)

Ha! We're [not quite dead yet; in fact, I think we're getting better!]( The main exchange we trade on is [Cryptopia]( (link to NYAN/BTC; exchange in scheduled maintenance mode at time of writing, thus my writing rather than buying NYAN at the moment).
I've been working on a revival of Nyancoin for the past two years at this point. We've got a small (one might legitimately say "tiny") community, but technically oriented and surprisingly active I think. It's a clonecoin, so it's quite easy to maintain. Although that's easy for me to say, not having done any core work on it myself. ;-p
Check out to see the community. There's a link to the client there. We pride ourselves on providing good tech support to anyone interested as best we can.
It's a great question though. That same idea was what originally brought me to NYAN: I was writing a series called "coin-a-day" (thus the username), and it was going to be my example for a "dead coin". Except, it wasn't quite dead yet. So I got curious and decided to see what it would take to turn a coin from near-dead to a powerhouse.
We're a short way down a long road, but so far, it's going well enough I think I can definitely say that NYAN is alive. ;-D

Indeed. I'm not the first to suggest such an attack but I haven't heard a whole lot of discussion about such a thing. Technically it doesn't break the rules, but I certainly think it breaks the spirit of the system. Even designing a system from scratch, I'm not sure how one would prevent that type of thing in general (that is, to guarantee that every valid transaction will be processed); it seems a worthwhile consideration.
edit: I probably just haven't read the right sources; I'm sure someone(s) clever has thought about this and figured it out and the coin with the solution is probably already trading.

It seems to me that a modest fee market makes sense at any size. Consider: if the standard transaction fee is nominal (or may be seen as nominal to a large transaction), then even an order of magnitude or more increase can make sense in order to increase the likelihood of a quick confirmation (by increasing the likelihood of being included in the next block and increasing the incentive for producing the next block (the latter being a rather small effect in Bitcoin where the hashing power is relatively fixed in magnitude between blocks)).
A lot of it is also the ratio between the typical block reward and the typical fee. If the fees start exceeding the block reward, then they are of course a bigger factor. But transaction fees today are far smaller than the block reward, so, yes, they are *less* relevant, just not totally irrelevant.
But I'm just being very broad-minded on what a "fee market" means: to me, bitcoin *already* is operating with one: miners are free to prioritize high-fee transactions (and would be rather foolish not to), and there are examples of various transactions which have been done with higher-than-necessary fees in an apparent attempt to increase quality of service. So despite a lack of widespread adoption, bitcoin *has* a fee market.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:45:14


It's an interesting question. I would presume that with 6 people one could get the majority of the hashing power. And the targets would likely be SPV rather than full nodes. Given that setup, it seems like it would be possible to pwn the system.
Now, if instead we argue that the requirement to "control Bitcoin" is to be able to convince full nodes that you got, say, a 10,000 BTC block reward, then aye, it may just be impossible. On the other hand, it would be possible to mine all empty blocks and refuse to build off of the non-empty blocks, and thus trick full nodes into believing the network is basically completely silent (ignoring unconfirmed transaction propagation and still presuming majority hashing power).
Sure, all the rules would still apply. But I think it would be safe to call that last scenario "control[ing] Bitcoin" still...

I generally agree, and yet it's interesting that some people are able to use TA successfully, and I'm talking about more than simply the blind luck that some people will have. I worked on a small research project doing some backtesting on a couple different models. One of them was based on a system that was used successfully over an entire career by our market expert, who managed a major pension fund with technical analysis as one of his tools. But the trick was that he also used his own judgement beyond that, he didn't simply follow the exact model as formulated.
I believe he was more than just consistently lucky, just as I believe that Buffet is more than just consistently lucky. And he definitely considered the TA useful. But I do wonder sometimes whether there couldn't have been another trader who used astrology successfully as well, just taking it as sort of a baseline inspiration / random noise generator and then processing that / making judgement about whether those essentially random signals are valid or not, and in that processing is the actual trick.
It's certainly a very fascinating field. I do miss that research a lot; it was one of the more pure, intellectual pursuits I had, and yet we also always had that pot of gold in mind, that if we really figured it out, we could do "something" awesome with it (the professor wanted a paper, the market expert and I were more on the side of making a hedge fund or something to make a ton of money). We actually started to find a statistically significant strategy towards the end of my time with it, relating to a slight "hot hands" effect with mutual funds, but we weren't quite done when I graduated and I haven't checked back to see if they ever got further with it.

It gets sketchier if I try to figure out if I can be considered to have plural...are the relatives of my brother-in-law also my "in-laws"? It's a stretch, but I think it could be seen as such.
Or, one could think of "step-*" as a variety of "in-law" as well, since the "in-law" refers to relatives "by law" (marriage) rather than blood: so, is my step-mother an "in-law" to me?

Sure, simple enough: with static participation, I would also expect it to gain in value, because of the limited supply and the way it is used by many of its current 'participants' (the 'hodler' sub-type comes to mind) as a store of value. This should lead to a steadily decreasing available supply, and thus, with a static participation it could also increase in value.
I don't consider that case particularly relevant, however, since as stated above, I expect that if it increases in value, it will have increased in participation, and I expect that if it decreases in value, it will have had decreased participation (both meaning significantly (orders of magnitude) and over the long-term (month or longer sustained)).

I think the question is poorly formed. Note that it personalizes it from my view of bitcoin to a presumption that I am invested in bitcoin, which I have not claimed here. By some views, I may own a bitcoin or two, by other views (because I don't have the private keys), I don't. In any event, my exposure via third-party held BTC is under 3 BTC: i.e.: not a significant amount of money
But let's take it as an impersonal question, basically rephrased to: "Is it necessary for more participation for Bitcoin to be a profitable investment?" Strictly speaking, I'd say no, I don't think that's strictly necessary. However, of course, I think if Bitcoin is successful, it will have greater participation, in many senses. And if it fails, I would certainly expect that it will have lost participation as a major factor.
And to skip ahead to where I would expect you're clearly going with this: no, I don't think "succeeds iff more participation" implies "scam". It is associated with many scams, sure. It is also associated with the network effect, which is common to many peer-to-peer technologies.

I am and have been homeless depending on how exactly one wants to use the term. Being homeless != panhandler. Not all panhandlers lack food or shelter either. I've known a number of them over the years; many are traveling and looking to fund their lifestyle. A lot of them, at decent locations, get enough food given to them during their 'shift' that their money is going to other things. For instance, I'd picked up a couple 'travelers' hitch-hiking and spent a couple days with them, and they talked about when a console had come out (I think it was a PSP), they wanted one, so they panhandled at an entrance/exit to a Walmart for a few hours and had gotten enough to buy one. That's a hell of a lot better hourly than I made at my jobs. But I prefer to work for my keep.
Is that everyone? No, I'm sure it's not. But it's at least a significant minority.
Now, where I agree with you: sure, panhandlers are almost universally going to want cash. I don't see why you're so insistant it's horrible to have a conversation with them looking to introduce them to something new, but whatever.
But the idea that anyone who doesn't have a stable place to live cannot possibly be interested in bitcoin is asinine.

Of course, there are ways this could be done, like making a purchase on Coinbase after every purchase, but I'm not aware of anything quite like what OP is describing, where basically a customer would swipe a card, and the payment processor would take the authorized fiat payment, and then the merchant gets an instant credit for the equivalent amount of bitcoin.

I agree with the rest saying "it's not", but I'll take a devil's advocate view too.
It's all about how we define "shit hitting the fan". We're assuming here that's it's some total apocalypse, primed that way because of the question.
But what if "shit hitting the fan" merely means "Global Financial Panic Round n+1"? In that case, perhaps there's not anarchy in the streets, perhaps law-and-order still functions on a local level and all that, but we "merely" are facing steadily and rapidly devaluing fiat currencies.
Consider various previous hyperinflation scenarios. Not all of them came with pure Lord of the Flies anarchy.
So in such a case, your food might be a reasonable investment, but you've only got non-perishable food stored up, obviously. Where, perhaps, the markets are still functioning and you could have a broader supply of food, as well as getting other goods and services, because you have hard currency available.
But more realistically, yeah, I agree with everyone else: if all of civilization is going tits-up, then you're absolutely right that food/ammunition (and other basic essentials: anvil/hammer/etc could be useful too, and so forth) would be better.
After all, Bitcoin is not going to work if the Internet goes down. And a lot of apocalypse scenarios are going to have that happen.

Many restaurants that do not charge for water are in jurisdictions where it is illegal for a restaurant to charge for water or to refuse water. Note that many restaurants these days do charge for water, in the form of bottled water. Additionally there are restaurants which charge nominal amounts for water as a charge for the cup when disposable cups are being used (presumably again varying on jurisdictions and owner choices).
Certainly there are restaurants which do not charge for water as a courtesy, but there are times when it is a legal mandate.

Although a lot is about how much you like the job rather than the pay. I've quit 60k, 70k, and 80k annual salary software positions, and the 80k was the easiest, because I felt the job was impossible because of the poor quality of communication I was getting from my boss. Quitting a pizza delivery job recently, where I was making something around OP here, was harder for me than the 80k position because I enjoyed the job more.
Not that it's relevant for this situation, since nothing OP said implied that he liked the job.
But hey, we can't all be rich. I do agree it's weird thinking this is a particularly bold move in general, but if a person's just starting out and doesn't have a degree and has worked actually minimum wage jobs before, I can see it taking a little bit of courage to quit their slightly-above-minimum wage job.
The crazy long notice is just a bit silly in my mind, but I'm not working there, maybe it was appropriate. Nothing wrong with it I suppose, but the only way I see it being ballsy is I could see some employers firing a person before the employee's intended quit date in a situation like that.
Edit: Although, in this circumstance, arguably OP shouldn't be worried about getting fired since all that epic BTC monies, so then nothing to be worried about, and nothing to be courageous about, right?

Okay. That does not accord with the conventional definition of centralized. Conventional definition of centralized: "having a center" ; conventional definition of decentralized: "not having a center". Even the small blockists' collective nightmare of datacenter full nodes is centralization, the process of becoming less decentralized (probably, but not necessarily! if Bitcoin grows enough in value, there could be more datacenters running Bitcoin than full nodes today!), but it does not end in a centralized state.
By the way, let's focus on the word "cash": does your understanding of the word "cash" have an allowance for transaction fees in the actual handing over of cash (that is, inherent to the process, not a fee by the merchant), or for the notion of not being able to make a particular cash payment because lots of people are using cash today?


Most people serious about torrenting use seedboxes which would be more than capable of running a BTC node for the foreseeable future. In the distant world of datacenters and doom, perhaps someone might have to spend as much for a Bitcoin node to be hosted as a decent Teamspeak server.
Perhaps I'm mildly understating things. But it's pretty absurd to sit at less than 3 tps on a multibillion dollar marketcap system and moan about how expensive a full node is if the blocks get a bit bigger. This is such irrelevant nonsense.


Bullshit. Core, per roadmap, will deal with congestion. Apply that same plan to 2x the hardcap and it will better serve the system.
Your claim is a nihilistic "well, if at some point you can't get more transactions in, then 2 tps is as good as 20 tps I guess". Stuff and bother.


Yeah, that's why we're all talking about it constantly. If it didn't matter, you wouldn't be fighting it and I wouldn't be rooting for it.


You know, this might be the one thing I somewhat agree with you on. Can you see my position, where BIP101 is worth it because doing that one hardfork could eliminate the need to hard-fork again for the issue. It's not about a short-term benefit then, it's about a long-term benefit to the system of "we were able to remove the temporary limit and show our miners aren't suicidal". I and many others believe that the hard cap can be an upper bound far above the usual block size quite safely, *just like it was at the start*.
The network is quite capable of handling rather more than it's doing. Even if it weren't though, I would still see no reason not to do a hard-fork to raise the cap and remove the issue, in particular if it can be done so that the hard-cap will generally remain, as it was for the first years after it was put in, irrelevant to general operations.
I would for that reason also support a hard-fork to remove the hardcap completely. I believe Bitcoin Unlimited can be configured to vote for such.
Of course, the miners have pretty clearly expressed a veto to doing anything so far. We'll see if that ever changes, but after XT and Classic, I can't really see this being credible if there isn't some significant hash voting for it at least within the next few months.


Yep, and it's worth it, even though honestly at this point I expect you guys probably will win and manage to slow the growth of BTC blocks for another year at least. We'll see. I'm long on popcorn. Until I see actual votes for a hard fork, it's still all just talk and a bit of code, but it's no more a "real" hardfork for BTC than testnet or Armory. The testnet of course because it explicitly is designed not to hold value and just to test code, and Armory because of course its code isn't setup to fork with Core (as far as I know) and is non-mining anyhow.
Of course these "fork candidates" are different in that if mining with certain flags is done they will activate and hardfork. "Ticking timebomb" from your perspective. Chance for a revival from my perspective.
Oh well, BTC will go on regardless, and as I said, I expect that 1MB could well continue to last throughout this year. I wish things would have turned out differently.
BTC currently has 88% of the cryptocurrency marketcaps from coinmarketcap (5,655,537,586 / 6,420,181,957). If 2016 ends with 1MB in place on BTC, I expect that figure will be noticeably lower.

Sure, I agree. As halfar points out though, that isn't necessarily the closest relevant analogy here. Of course, there is no perfect analogy for bitcoin. Quite inherently, a currency does require broad adoption. The Euro didn't have a clear path to the strength that it now has through all of its early development.
So we could use analogies to social networks, but then the differences between a network for socializing and a currency / payment mechanism start to become the parts to pick at.

I mean, Bitcoin is science fiction a decade ago. I do think free flights would be awesome and terrible. I do agree that online gambling is a far more serious, immediate proposal for it.
I think the 1% is a lot easier case to make. The pure 0% does seem difficult given the stake requirements for proper risk-of-ruin defense and yet allow the house to still offer high stakes bets with high payouts. Because that's a lot of capital requirement for the business, a lot of variance in cash position to take on without net expectation of direct profit. Honestly, I'd be very worried about what they could be doing to make enough money off of me to be able to justify *zero* edge.
It's not the cost of the software. That's cheap. It's easy enough to setup a dice site, and that's a simple casino. The major capital requirement for a streamlined online gambling operation would be simply the bank, right?
So I agree Bitcoin gambling is likely to be "free" in the sense of the software being free and open source software in some instances at least, but it seems like even if the edge is quite small by conventional standards (0.5%?), something still remains.
Like another commenter suggested, I think it might also make sense that there would be promotional 0% games and then games that allow higher stakes which have a 1% edge or things like that.
Perhaps we're only seeing the initial transitional future and you have the whole view of it. :-) I can't tell you how much I would love to see a great poker site I could play on. I just haven't seen anything that had the network effect that would let me openly play as a United States subject, and if I'm going to have to register location for their legal purposes, I'm not willing to lie.
I do expect there will be a lot of low and zero edge games that pop-up and are popular in the future. One of the problems will be which ones are trustworthy and reliable or not. Sometimes a low edge might be worth paying rather than a "zero edge" if the zero edge is not actually reliable or honest in some way.
I like this free flights idea more and more though. Each airline could specialize in their own brand(s)/varieties of intoxicants allowed or prohibited (including a Mormon variety and similar).

From what I've heard, a lot of Bitcoin payment providers will basically eat the loss of double spends as the cost of doing business. So one Peter Todd produces a loss, while a thousand customers results in a little bit of revenue which offsets it.
I'm not sure what's being done in this case, but I would suspect it's the same. Which means for the merchant the situation is improved versus the card networks, where the chargebacks are taken out of the merchant's account, plus a fee, and risk of losing their account at all.
So with cards, it's considered your fault by default if a customer charges back, because it's a supported part of the system (although it's possible to appeal; the presumption generally seems to be on the customer's side, but good merchants with documentation do win appeals at times, still makes a chargeback attempt a hassle for the merchant at least). With BTC, at least so far, it seems like if using a third-party processor they will consider a double-spend an attack rather than a feature, rightly so, and thus do their best to defend against it and cover the expense when an attack gets through.

Yeah that's just weird integration. I wonder why they didn't print a QR on the receipt at least to be able to scan.
Having both a software development background and having worked fast food about a year in total as a sort of working vacation from the cube, I cannot understand why they would design the system like that. There must be other communication going on already over the network connection they both have so that the transaction id alone suffices. Which means that typing anything in should be superfluous. They should just do it as the usual cash payment screen, where it would show the pending orders to be paid and the right one is selected. Except even easier because, really, how many pending Bitcoin payments are there typically, so the "only one pending" base case comes into play more option where it can already know what order is to be paid, so it could just show the QR code on the auxiliary system immediately after the Bitcoin payment method is selected on the main system and notification is sent automagically over the network to the auxiliary system.
And then if it's really busy with Bitcoin customers, there's just a list to select from first on the pad to indicate which ticket. Usually it'll be the one at the top (oldest notification of Bitcoin payment which is still unpaid), but in some instances it may vary. It could even still default to the first notification in that case and have the user scroll through, if the first notification is it often enough.
Given that the user flow is going to be: person at the window/teller already when they decide their payment method, I think this will actually be pretty synchronous and the idea of selecting between multiple transactions to pay is probably superfluous itself.
tl;dr: Armchair coder says it's a bad design that the cashier has to type in the transaction id from the paper receipt manually. Whoever wrote that is either an asshole, or at the very least, never spent a day working in fast food.
Edit: So long as one simply pairs the main terminal and the particular individual pad, of course. So at worst, one id to type in each time switching the pad between registers in order to not have to type an id for each transaction. And even without that, as long as paired to store, should be relatively well-ordered still. Race condition is something like: single pad for multiple registers, Alice and Bob both have customers paying by Bitcoin. Alice presses the button first but Bob already has the pad. Alice's customer payment is now up by default, so Bob must scroll to the next entry before having the customer pay the QR code, or Bob's customer will pay the bill for Alice's customer accidentally.

Under current US law, if an employee works full-time, the employer must provide health insurance. Social - do you mean disability and unemployment? That's mandated and administered state-by-state. The federal social security tax is a socialized retirement insurance.
By comparison, in the part-time delivery work I was doing (pizza boy), I was getting a similar amount but without health insurance, because I was part-time. The disability, unemployment, and retirement still apply. Our Social Security system has some solvency issues for the long-term however, given that our politicians like to rob the trust fund and demographics, so it's not like most of these are particularly good programs, but there is technically coverage along those lines.

I'm somewhat sympathetic to that general line of argument, but I don't believe it applies in this case. Even in the datacenters future, there would be miners in many different jurisdictions. I just don't see the centralizing doing to a point of "single server". Hypothetically, it's possible, some evil entity decides to take over all of Bitcoin, but it's already possible. I think it's pretty disingenuous to argue both that the block cap isn't interesting *and* that it's going to wipe out thousands of full nodes with no replacement and lead to a single entity in a single jurisdiction happening, and that jurisdiction shuts them down.

How much network traffic is sending blocks rather than transactions?
There's not a limit on making transactions, and I think most of the bandwidth would be relaying transactions. As I understand at least earlier proposals on block relay, there's relatively little data needed for the block itself if the transactions are already known.
Although I suppose it can certainly be argued that fewer people will bother to make transactions and that it's easier to manage the transactions if fewer will end up confirmed.
I'm not sure the relationship is necessarily as direct as one would expect between bandwidth usage and block size.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:37:46

You're either conflating two things or misunderstanding what is being discussed. (I don't mean that to sound as harsh as it does; just trying to state where I think I'm disagreeing here with what you said.)
The protocol limit of block size, not the actual size of an average block, is being discussed.
Although I can understand how, in Bitcoin, the two things get confused easily.
For most coins, and for most of the history of Bitcoin, protocol limit block size != average block size.
The start of my commenting was in reply to the claim that a protocol limit increase necessitated a bandwidth increase. I claimed it might not be quite as simple as just a perfect direct correlation.
You're certainly right though that it would be possible to run a node with bandwidth costs as low as approximately the size of the actual series of blocks created.
Of course, this reduces to the same thing if you claim that Bitcoin will always have an average blocksize in the future which is roughly equal to its protocol limit. Which could be a reasonable claim to make, but I wanted to note that difference explicitly.

Yeah, makes sense. People don't tend to trust banks these days (or ever?), so I can see it being hard to have to ask questions (because they can be on a hair trigger).
It's a "tipbot"; these used to be relatively common in the early days of Bitcoin on Reddit. As transactions fees rose, there were fewer that stuck around. And then at least one had the person behind it run away with the coins. I just run this as it's the easiest way to give people a little bit.
The idea is basically that it keeps a balance of your coins, and you can deposit or withdraw on-chain, or "tip" to send coins to other people on Reddit. And you already figured out how to accept, which is a good sign. Let me know if you'd like any assistance with the rest of it.
Frankly, it makes me a bit nervous because if the coins were more valuable I'd have to worry about financial regulation operating this thing, but for now the coins are still cheap enough that I hope it's reasonable to be doing. At current prices, that's only a nominal $16 or so.

Yeah, that makes sense. The reason I've got cash in the bank is precisely because, while nothing's perfect, and I've certainly had a couple annoyances over the years, I trust banks a hell of a lot more than some random crypto exchange (I mean, hell, the one I got my money from folded up behind me basically...).
It's absolutely fascinating stuff to me. I've been interested in banking and business since I was a kid, which is exactly why crypto was interesting to me (long before I started actually getting into it at all myself).
I've always thought it would be fun to do that kind of work, but I went CS rather than finance after being irritated with how academically weak the latter seemed and how bs a lot of the Wall Street stuff seemed (ironic a bit there, but then, the very fact that crypto has ended up worse in so many ways is precisely what's so irritating to me about it).
So...trading walls for walls. ;-)

Mobile and internet marketing are definitely the future of marketing in my amateur and decidedly unskilled marketing opinion. It can be a challenge to drive results, but there are also increasingly sophisticated metrics and optimization being applied.

But the question is for how long. And I think the people who are contributing to Bitcoin Core are pretty self-selecting. And that the money will be small enough (for a small amount of change) that there won't be a massive rush of low-quality commits.
It seems like the argument is basically that while there is a sort of prisoner's dilemma type of scenario, because it's an iterative, repeated thing, then the incentives might tend toward co-operation (that is, not gaming the system) because otherwise the 'players' risk getting booted essentially (or having their pull requests get less attention and priority, etc).
We'll see though. But I do think there's a good argument here that this isn't exactly the typical job scenario for initial incentives, that we have a higher quality, better motivated group to start.

To be sure, there are configuration limits and actual limits on node capacity.
What I meant was that at a protocol level, there aren't really enforced limits so far as I'm aware.
From a practical perspective, yes, the network definitely does have actual limits on what it can store or transmit, and prioritizes it by transaction fee. But that's a common node configuration choice as opposed to an enforced consensus requirement like block size.
Individual miners and nodes can and do choose to use lower values for minfee or have more memory for the pool. The network can change these values thus pretty seamlessly, no need for any change in code even. But yes, absolutely, they are still limits in practice if one wanted to actually start sending more transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-10 05:29:16
Personally, I'd put the over/under for bitcoin reaching that at about ten years. We shall see.
You're absolutely right that it's the history and certainty of its value that makes gold what it is, as well as its universality. Obviously bitcoin won't be able to match the history, but it does have other strengths which gold doesn't, notably the ability to transact it online and to divide it easily and almost infinitely (gold is certainly divisible, but not conveniently to the typical end-user).

As a libertarian with an ax to grind, I still think bitcoin will coexist with many other means of payment and stores of value, and that government isn't the root of *all* evil, technically. ;-)
Not all of us are opposed to sanity nor to mainstream beliefs.
But the comments which presume mainstream ideas to be unquestionable don't tend to do well around here. Like, for instance, considering modern, mainstream, ordinary Keynesian economics infallible and unquestionable and Austrian economics totally useless doesn't tend to do well here, but plays well in any other sub.
So this is true:

What do you mean, "we", kemosabe?
The thread is comparing the marketcaps of bitcoin and gold. It doesn't particularly matter for that *why* they each have their respective valuations. If BTC were to reach gold's market cap, it would not be for the exact same reasons, which is precisely my point.
And pointed out store of value, sure, but just saying the recognition was something gold has that bitcoin doesn't. How exactly does that shutdown the conversation to anything else?
So you can wander off by yourself and mutter about store of value in a corner if you like, but there's no "we" which is myopically unable to talk about anything else. It's just you.
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:23:03
Actually, there are a lot of alternative blockchains. Every alt is an alternate blockchain. There are a lot of advantages to using Bitcoin's, but there are some advantages for others as well (for instance, faster transaction times and cheaper transactions (on a value basis)), so it depends on the application.
But that doesn't change the central point that the blockchains currently in use are inseparable from the coins tied to them.

Yeah, I can totally understand that being an important consideration. I'm not good at figuring out the right psychological tricks. It could still be possible though, like doing something like "how much can we increase the balance in this account today to support developer Y" sort of thing, but I can definitely understand too why being able to combine it into "supporting bitcoin core developers" is stronger than any one. It just adds a layer of organizing on top.
Anyhow, hopefully it'll get sorted out. The developers are the core of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-10 16:24:09

@_date: 2015-04-10 13:08:42
Yep. I think part of it that really hammered it home for me were the "zombie apocalypse" type objections. It's not because that's a likely scenario, but because some sort of scenario like that (societal collapse / technology failure) is at least possible, and it's true that our online currencies are going to be worthless at that point (along with the plastic of course). Paper money, strangely enough, could be fine (no inflation of it at that point), although gold and silver are the classic ones thought of.
And there's just the question of what people trust. *Everyone* values gold, whether or not they want to hold it. I think even if there were the asteroid mining of gold, and no industrial use, and maybe even some transmutation figured out, it's going to have a value.
If nothing else, as people point out in jest, it's shiny. But seriously, people would want to have it even if it were one-hundredth the current value just because of how much it *had* been worth I think. I mean, if I could own ten pounds of gold, I would, even if it were only worth $1 at that point.
So I certainly don't see it going away.
The difference I see that's the largest benefit for bitcoin, if we skip here the question of *whether* bitcoin will take off, is the fact that it *hasn't* arrived yet. So it has a lot more growth potential than gold does I think. And for me, I'm looking for speculative value rather than stable value, so that's perfect.
In fact, I take it further and that's why I'm messing around with altcoins, one in particular, because it has even more growth potential than bitcoin, because it's so close to dead at this point.
Of course, with each of these steps, a lot more risk is taken on, and thus the current valuations.
So I'd be quite happy with a gold stockpile. I'd convert some of it into other things, of course, but I certainly understand its value.
And I really do think understanding how and why gold and silver have value, and the fiat currencies have value, is really important for understanding why bitcoin has value. There really is a lot of similarity in the concept of a medium of exchange and store of value. They have very different characteristics, of course, but the very fact that they can all be used in the same functions shows their similarity.

I don't understand why it's s^2 when doing the point arithmetic. In general, the point arithmetic and point multiplication sections just present the equations without explanation.
Given that we're encrypting the points, I also don't understand why we're converting into these points and back out to begin with. If we're encrypting the points, why not just encrypt the original plaintext?
On the polynomial representation in Chapter 2, that seems incomplete. Surely the coefficients must be stored too. Perhaps ECC doesn't need them, but then you should state that. What you're describing is *not* representing the whole polynomial expression. Perhaps there is some term for this simplified version, but I don't know it if so. [Later on, there's a reference to polynomial arithmetic as used by ECC; that's probably the case here.]


This doesn't make sense to me for a couple reasons. First, you said that there are different curves used for each, so how do we have this hypothetical for them being used on the same curve? Second...for a given curve, surely the set of points which satisfy it cannot be affected by the method used to calculate it.
Integer multiplicative inversion - the solution appears automagically. This might be intended.
And then my brain started melting around page 18, as is usual for me trying to understand cryptography, and in particular if I'm tired. I'll try to finish this later, but it has been helpful for my understanding already. Hopefully my questions and comments might be slightly useful as well.

Because the important part is the vast, overwhelming agreement between them. It's a show fight, then they just continue to do the same damn thing. The foreign policy is the same, the banking policy is the same, what the fuck does gay marriage matter compared to having an agreement that we can arrest and torture anyone we want anytime we want? Compared to the agreement that we can print unlimited money? Compared to the agreement that the only people who matter are the ones who have millions to spend on ~~bribes~~campaign donations? Compared to the agreement that we're going to spy on everyone everywhere all the time, limited only by technology rather than laws or morality?
So, tell me, what are these massive differences that are so important to you? Seriously, what?
It's fucking theater. And it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
Yes, I think Rand Paul is different, at least a bit. And that's exactly why the entire mainstream media will spin everything against him and why he has no chance in this primary.
And as for vote rigging...there is so much shit on both sides. Another area they agree on.
Yes, they "fight" each other. We're such a great, wonderful democracy that we get all of two choices, because it'd just be too damn obvious if there was only one. And any power that actually matters has their bets covered on both sides and so nothing ever fucking changes.
You really think Obama's delivered a lot of hope and change?
Let's take, for instance, the insurance mandate. That started as a Republican idea. And then, sure, they fought against it when it was Obama pushing it, because why not? Does it fucking matter?
Anything that benefits the rich and powerful will go through. Some pandering to the peasants will happen from time to time, but no one gives a damn about them. Votes don't fucking matter.

One aspect I don't see covered as much in here: it's a different currency.
So let's ignore the whole payment network aspect for a second. Why would this currency potentially have more value in the future? Fixed supply. Now, as stated above, we aren't there yet. There are still more bitcoins being created.
But there are going to be more USD and EUR and everything else created over time. The purchasing power *always* falls; the only apparent exceptions are caused by costs dropping faster than purchasing power drops. When we look on the scale of decades, it is inevitable that something denominated in fiat will be worth less.
Now, the biggest disadvantage with bitcoin is we don't *know* that it will be worth more or have at least the same purchasing power in the next decades. That's the big question and it's a separate answer to say why it will or won't. I think it will, which is why I'm in.
So, yeah, you can't improve on free and instant and easy. But there are other aspects.
Also, a lack of central control. I'm sure that doesn't matter to you whatsoever, because you've never had a problem with any central authority ever and you agree with every rule which has ever been made, but for the rest of us, it's nice.

This is way, way too broad. What do you know? What do you need to know? The examples and sources thing...like, do you read this subreddit? Or should we just point you to the sidebar?
But I'll try to give you a little bit of my perspective.
Pro: It's the future. That's my opinion, but I'm as convinced about that as I am anything in the world. This is natively online money. It transacts quickly and cheaply, and the payment network and currency are built together. It has a(n ultimately) fixed supply, which in my opinion is gold (that's a pun but also true).
Con: It's still just starting. Gold has a history the length of recorded human history. Bitcoin has a few years. There are a number of rough edges and it's still considered beta software technically.
My personal experience: I was familiar with bitcoin both from the Silk Road and from being interested in the technology back when it was around $5-$10. Much to my regret, I played poker during college rather than buying bitcoin. Now I have a few bitcoin and I'm playing with an altcoin to learn more about bitcoin from having an excuse to work with it (for instance, right now I should be learning about the bitcoin build process to start a fork of the latest version to update the client).
Let us know what you'd like to know and we can be of more help.

And many people haven't had a lot of purchases offering BTC either.
BTC is definitely the main market. But altcoin supporters can be very dedicated. And even if they don't buy, they are often interested in promoting anyone who accepts them. I definitely would recommend adding support for DOGE and LTC just to gain the experience if nothing else (I know you said you'd done it with another, but I think it's important to keep working with altcoins; get to where it's "why not?" for supporting another one, in my opinion; this is far easier said than done, of course).
I don't expect you'll have a lot of purchases with the alts, especially not right away, but it's possible, and I think it'll be valuable in the future. The very existence of something like that helps to build the alts which helps to increase the chances you ultimately get noticeable sales through there.

That certainly makes a difference, but even with just 0.1 BTC on top of 25 BTC, no reason to ignore the extra money, right?


To me that would indicate that they're running different rules, not that higher transaction fees are ineffective. To the contrary, if they're running different rules, at least some of them are likely to prioritize higher transaction fees in general.
Comments [like this]( show that there is an active fee market now.

To determine how evil bitcoin is, eh? Do you have an evil index?
I'm not very persuaded by your graphs; only skimmed the article itself. But doing things like comparing online crime reports to the number of bitcoin transactions is...well, I fail to see the merit in the methodology whatsoever. Same with IRS investigations. Sure, you only use it to back up the point that bitcoin hasn't had a massive impact, but you use poor statistical reasoning to back up the obviously true conclusion.
To make your actual claim, you basically just assert it and have a quote from one individual as your proof.
I'm sorry to say, I think this is pretty mediocre. It's going to be popular here, of course, because of its conclusion, but it's not really higher quality than the anti-bitcoin stuff. It just happens to conclude what we want it to, and be nicely formatted.
And, somewhat joking and somewhat seriously, if you're going to talk about "isn't that evil" and "how evil Bitcoin really is", hell, why not just embrace the yellow journalism and make some sort of scale to define and rate how evil you think a thing is.

Right, makes sense that on-going polls would require currently-valid signatures, while a specific vote of course needs to have a single deterministic and transparent result and so should rely upon a single specified time.

Yes, I understood that conclusion but I don't understand why. Sure, using plaintext is insecure, unless it's encrypted. But if it's encrypted, then it shouldn't matter what the plaintext was. That's the point of encryption. I mean, sure, if we assume insufficient padding or something.
But since the entire point of ECC is to convert to these points apparently, I think it's worth explaining *why* that's useful.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:57:38


Doesn't it? It seems quite primitive to me, but it seems obvious that there's a market there. Higher transaction fees have been paid before, sometimes from old defaults, sometimes from a deliberate attempt to ensure quality-of-service on confirmations. There have got to be miners out there recognizing higher transaction fees for higher priority inclusion.
That's a market.
Now, could it be more sophisticated? Without question. Most clients provide little to no visibility to current market conditions on the fee market. But any serious client does and should allow for higher fees to be set, with the expectation this may be necessary or useful at times.
I haven't done it on bitcoin, personally, but I've done similar on a clonecoin which is just a skin off an old bitcoin core.
Higher fees can be useful. I'm not sure how that's not a market.
In prior stress tests, and I would presume this one too, high (significantly higher than the spam rate) transaction fee transactions would not be stuck this long.
Aren't most pools intelligent enough to implement this sort of logic, regardless of what portions are in core or not? I mean, maybe I'm way offbase here and bitcoin really does always blindly mine without regard to transaction fee, but I had the impression that it made a difference in priority or something somewhere even in core, neh?

Ah, didn't realize what you meant with that question there. Thanks for the clarification.


Usability is relevant to security. Unless you just want to do thought experiments in an ivory tower.
Edit: Besides which, the question of what the security model allows a user to do is relevant anyhow. That quote is just so silly. "It doesn't matter that the personal body armor is 2000 lbs." Well no, not if no one ever needs to use it I suppose.


Not necessarily. There could be uses to knowing something about an account before knowing who owns it.


No. That's not a disproof of the idea (fact) that some people know the relationships between some addresses and their owners.


It may not. I simply mentioned it as an interesting possible attack. It is still an information leak. For someone interested in profiling one side of a debate or another, being able to identify the accounts on one side or another may let them track down other likely information on the activity of the people behind those accounts, which could hypothetically, in a long enough string of pulling in other information, help lead to identification even, or more realistically, simply be able to identify "these coins are all likely held by people who support X".

The thing is, the everyday is fine. Things work until they don't. It's sign-up and "everything suddenly went wrong" which are the problems. Also, having transactions canceled sucks (Coinbase has had a long history of this; whether or not they're an exchange is more questionable (talking about other than their exchange, this was before that), they're more of a broker/dealer).

Actually, at the moment I wouldn't consider the volatility a problem, really. I mean, what's being discussed here is the positive potential of the volatility. And it has been relatively stable so far this year, in my opinion. Boringly so. I mean, I would've liked to have seen either &lt;$100 or &gt;$1000 already, but that's the gambler in me.
I do expect we're going to see more spikes in the future, through the cryptocurrencies. Of course I'm biased on that, or alternately put, have put my money behind that expectation. I think those spikes (positive volatility) are a very good thing and a critical part of the growth process.

@_date: 2015-04-10 09:56:41
Okay, thanks!
Just as a suggestion, I think explaining the purpose of doing this makes sense at the beginning rather than somewhere later in the text. I think that's pretty fundamental, and unless I missed something, it's not there.
I will make my best attempt to finish it later, but it's definitely difficult material for me and I have a limited amount of time online.
I think the bitcoin whitepaper is a good example of a technical document which explains the overall concept, and then goes into details. By contrast...this seems rather undirected to me. I know, I only went through the start, but it's got the typical mathematics approach of "TAKE IN ALL THESE FACTS NOW" rather than including a narrative approach of explaining *why* something is being done or where an equation comes from (even if it's to note that something will be explained later, which is included at times).
No offense intended. This is absolutely good material and I'm likely just outside the intended audience which has the patience to actually understand the math behind it all, but I think it would be more accessible with an 'executive summary' type of introduction. At the start, you say the "why" will be explained in that chapter, but in my opinion that section doesn't really explain the why, and it's buried under a lot of introductory math first.
I know there are people that can handle this sort of thing, but for myself, I find it really hard to wade through this type of stuff without at least having a higher-level understanding of its purpose first.

lol. I am technically homeless and unemployed right now. Don't tell me about not functioning. ;-p
Okay, basic introduction. Gotcha. Yeah, that is clearer. I figured that was probably the approach, but didn't want to jump in with that until I was sure.
Well, I'd say the "Getting Started" link over on the sidebar makes sense to start. :-)  Those steps aren't necessarily all applicable but it gives you an idea.
So there are sort of two major approaches here. There's the approach of learning about all of the fundamentals, which is great, but takes a while, and eventually goes into a lot of advanced math and programming. The other approach is sort of just to jump in and try it out.
If you want to go through the fundamentals, the whitepaper is a great place to start:  ; I've actually never made it all the way through, but don't let that stop you. As much as you can read will help. Just try to absorb what you can, and then give it some time, and try it again, and repeat.
On the side of just trying it out, you can make an online wallet at  Now, this isn't the high-security approach that the dedicated bitcoin user would do (having everything local and managing security themselves, etc.), but it gets you on the network as it were. Another approach are the Reddit tipbots. I actually haven't used the bitcoin tipbot for a while now, so I can't swear to the syntax and such, but this is a clonecoin which is based on the same technology:
+1000 nyan
What that does is send you a message that you can create an account with it (reply with +accept to have the account created). It is another form of online wallet, and it can then be sent to any other address. Of course, note that that is nyancoin, rather than bitcoin, so the addresses would be nyancoin addresses in that case, which is a very obscure thing in comparison.
You can also get a wide variety of wallets from 
You can send it to anyone who has an address. Addresses are free. Transactions generally have a transaction fee of 0.001 BTC iirc (the rules can be rather complex and the standard fee sometimes goes down by a factor of 10).
In order to really use it though, you're going to want to get some. And that requires either buying it (there are a lot of exchanges and such; on the other hand, it can be rather expensive at this point) or being given it (possible in smallish amounts) or earning it (selling goods or services).
Spending is just sending with a particular address being setup expecting a certain amount. That is, if you were checking out at a site and you owed 0.01 BTC, then it will give you an address, you send the 0.01 BTC to that address, and they'll know it was you because they generate an address for each transaction (there are practically an infinite number of addresses, so best practices actually include using each address only once).
There's a lot of complexity, but I hope that helps with the basics. I would definitely recommend reading through the sidebar and links. There are certainly gaps there, but it should give you a really solid intro.

But from a technology perspective, "only [...] 3 [or] 4 [...] banks" is still "decentralized" at least and still technically "distributed", for the purpose of considering how algorithms and systems work. And banks notoriously use game theory and routinely record value exchanges on a network system with other banks. I could see some of them switching to a private blockchain of some sort, hypothetically.
They could also do some type of "master"/"slave" (strictly technologically speaking, of course) setup with, as you say, 3 or 4 core banks or so, and then have 100+ other "participating banks" of various sorts, which "wouldn't need" full permissions on the blockchain. Equities world already has the notion of preferred stock or common, voting or non-voting shares. 
Blockchains are showing banks they can use code as law in a 'killer app' for them.
Edit: Or, of course, they could just trade one of the existing fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies for settlements, hypothetically. I'm sure their risk-analysts would have heart attacks *en masse*, though.

Yeah, I can understand what you mean. Actually engaging in the point is certainly valid (how can we use this best?) and an unanswered question. I was trying to reference the lazy criticism which gets brought up here so much where people are or act entirely ignorant of any uses of bitcoin.
It'd be like, if we're using the 70s PC world, if someone was like "duh, well, so what use are these anyhow? paperweight?", that's not insightful, it's just ignorant. Whereas if they're saying "should we have a standard operating system which can work on any hardware or should we customize our operating systems to our hardware?", they're engaging in the same general speculation, but in an actually useful way.
Sure, talking about bitcoin's flaws is useful and necessary. I've seen this happen plenty, for instance regarding the blocksize question. I still think it's more productive for supporters to be talking about the issues in the context of how to fix them rather than the "harharhar, bitcoin will never have any use because 7 transactions / second is nothing!" type of comment the "antis" are fond of.
So...it's all about context.

The Core devs don't like to answer that question. As seen here, they like to basically try to misdirect and imply such a situation (a well-propagated initial transaction as the base-case) cannot happen or is not important.
But current network behavior is for a node to reject a double-spend (a conflicting version of a transaction it's already seen). Like a programming grammar nazi, [nullc took a similar statement by me to respond, basically "lulz! talking about network *and* node??? Clearly you don't understand!! There is no network consistency! You can't know which transaction came first! ha, 0-conf is impossible!1!"](
I'm not a fan of zero-conf. But it's asinine to pretend like it's impossible for the network (collective set of the nodes) to have seen transaction A first. And if so, then under current behavior, they would collectively reject a conflicting transaction B.
And rather than talk about they change, again, they just want to dodge and ignore that very central point about current network behavior and instead point out the current difficulty of knowing whether or not a given transaction has been widely propagated. [And they want to do more to make that difficult.]( Oh, no, no, excuse me, clearly that's a very sophisticated DDoS defense and not at all a way to make 0-conf / tracking transaction propagation more difficult.

Although it's a great heresy to say it around here, even greater than mentioning the-client-which-must-not-be-named, I do believe this is a great example of why it can be useful to have some altcoin holdings. For instance, LTC has done fairly well during all of this controversy. Of course, I think that's a short-term effect since LTC doesn't have any plan to raise block size themselves as far as I know, but they do have 4x throughput capacity for now and are nowhere near the limit, so I can see them as a useful alternative for smaller-value transactions.
I believe BTC will continue to be the 'gold standard', but I expect it can be outperformed by good alts. I do believe that the block size will ultimately be raised, but I also think that the fact that the debate's gone this long without anything like consensus is a major risk factor at this point.

It's "failed", huh? Still trading at, what, a 300x multiple or so to your currency?
Amusingly, I think this sentence may be technically correct, except in this case that may not actually be the best kind of correct.
"Currency" is a relatively high bar. It does imply a stability of value that BTC does not yet have, which is rather understandable given it is still in a relatively inflationary period as well as being in a long-term expansion.
Of course, there are surprisingly strong arguments to be made that BTC has, in fact, passed the bar by now and should be properly considered to be a currency: it can and has been used as a unit of account and transacted in primarily, even if that may not be the majority retail use.
But yes, I'm sure fiat will continue to exist and you'll be transacting in it in "years to come". The total collapse of fiat, everywhere, has got to take at least a decade or so, neh? I'd say don't worry about it for, oh, 20 more years, okay?

If that. iirc the changes Core has introduced along with the increasing network congestion means that the transaction would probably simply be dropped.

Before: any transaction potentially acceptable by zero-conf.
After: whatever proportion of transactions use Opt-in RBF cannot be accepted by zero-conf.
That damages zero-conf.


Nope, but nice straw man you've got there. Opt-in RBF completely destroys all existing implementations of zero-conf, requires a new check to exclude all of these transactions, thus leading to zero-conf being less supported. Opt-in RBF is not harmless and damages zero-conf.
The original question was about why this would be pushed so hard. Those motivations go beyond this change in my opinion. As I stated, I expect more such changes, and I expect you (and others) to continue to deny that anything is happening, and I expect that zero-conf will be fully destroyed by Core.

Depends on the client. I don't know what Core's done lately, but historically it did refuse to relay conflicting transactions. FSS RBF is supported, but that's explicitly only for unconflicting replacements ("first seen safe"). And child-pays-for-parent similarly isn't conflicting.
Now, there is the "full RBF" as well, but that is, as noted by another comment, technically opt-in, such that most transactions don't actually support this. So as long as the transaction is marked as final, which the vast majority are, the standard network behavior is not to accept a conflicting one.
*However*, it's important to note that of course a node can only reject a conflicting transaction if the original is stored in its memory pool. Because of the far larger amount of unconfirmed transactions at this point compared to historically, and nodes thus having to prune their mempool (or else have a massive amount of memory or risk crashing) and new procedures to drop transactions based on their fees, there's a chance that a low-fee transaction could be poorly propagated.
So if a transaction is well-propagated and has a high enough fee to even stay in mempool, then it should theoretically not be replaced. However, there are some clients which *will* broadcast conflicting transactions, and by some basic, short-term game theoretic analysis it would make sense for a miner to always take the highest fee transaction regardless of what came first (I think there are legitimate counter-arguments to this, but it's certainly a plausible approach).
So, no, not completely false. Just more complicated.

Won't the network currently not relay double spends, and wouldn't it continue to do so for the transactions which do not opt-in to Full-RBF? Wouldn't that make unconfirmed non-opt-in transactions significantly "safer" (less prone to double spends) than opt-in transactions as long as the network continues to follow that policy?
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:35:38


Ahh, right, excellent point. Although, they only need to do that because the network won't relay it, right? Same argument then to the receipt of those transactions:
Won't the network currently not accept double spends (defined here from a node-perspective of a later transaction which conflicts with one they've already seen), and won't it continue to reject them for transactions which do not opt-in to Full-RBF? Wouldn't that make unconfirmed non-opt-in transactions significantly "safer" (less prone to double spends) than opt-in transactions as long as the network continues to follow that policy? 
Consider a case where some walltime has elapsed and the recipient has already broadcast the original transaction themselves. Presume the tools are in place (to the extent they aren't now) for the recipient to verify that major mining pools see their unconfirmed transaction, and that no double spend has been seen so far. Then aren't they safer (specifically against double-spends, ignoring a case where they actually wanted the transaction to be modified somehow) with a transaction that, so far, the network won't allow to be double-spent, even though unconfirmed, rather than a transaction which the network would freely allow to be double spent? (presuming opt-in Full RBF gained enough hashing power to matter, which I expect it will)
@_date: 2015-09-15 02:06:17


Wouldn't the signature imply that? Serious question, I don't know the basics that well: doesn't the ability to sign an arbitrary message for a public key imply precisely the knowledge needed to prove actual ownership (i.e.: ability to move the coins) by that same signer? Am I missing something?
Edit: Also, making people move their coins for the system seems like a significantly higher burden than signing messages. For instance, consider someone using their coins to access multiple systems like this. It is a very different system if they can use one account they've made for all site's signatures vs. having to select which of four addresses to move it to, being able thus to only vote on one of the four (presuming they didn't want to split their coins for the sake of a simple example case).
Edit 2: I think you're both missing an attack vector here as well, or at least haven't stated it that I've seen: I think de-anonymization can happen simply because of sufficient precision in the votes. If you know who voted and the effect of that (? how? can see size, but in theory should be able to vote without detection presumably), and the amount translates 1:1 with the votes, they might be able to identify an account or at least significantly reduce the search space (potentially identification when intersected with another such filter, for instance).

That dollar 0 conf could already have been double-spent. Now it would be easier. I don't think it's catastrophic for that usecase, because if there is a double spend, they aren't out physical goods and can block that user / device in the future.
I think a bigger threat to that dollar transaction is if the block size doesn't increase and it gets forced out due to transaction fees. The hypothetical $20 transaction fee that some like to talk about as no problem would kill it with far more certainty.

No, I think that makes perfect sense in any market. We buy because we expect and hope the price to go up. If the price has been going down, we can say that past performance doesn't predict future results all we like, but it makes a person nervous to hold.
Not to mention that being at the lower price (and with the ATH comfortably above) means that there's more room for appreciation before it starts being seen as "over-valued" again.
But we'll see where the market goes. I know I always end up wanting more BTC regardless...
Edit: And even if you're simply holding, I can see it because ~$300 isn't *that* much lower than ~$400 in a volatile market, and being relatively confident the bottom is behind you is a nice point.

His argument has been that a larger block size increases orphan rates for those with slower internet connections. The counter-argument is that a pool should have a decent internet connection and that throughput capacity of the system is more important.

I agree. The standard expectation should be "even if the majority of the mining power is malicious, the system will survive [albeit possibly/likely in some degraded fashion]"
In practice, I think we see far more benign or benevolent miners than malicious, but from a game theory perspective for considering possible rule sets I do think the standard for analysis should be "does the system break if a majority, possibly temporary, is hostile?".
I don't think BIP101 has a problem in that regard, personally, although I do think the 75% threshold could cause issues.

No, but there's a psychological barrier for people who hear about Bitcoins having gone from being worth pennies to $600. The upside where Bitcoins are worth $100,000 or more apiece just doesn't seem possible to the average person. And the attempt to switch to quoting in bits didn't really take.
I think it's absolutely correct to say that there are a lot of people who may have a slight exposure to BTC who could think that it's already had the explosive growth it's going to get.
Personally, given the attitude of the Bitcoin community in a few ways, I really doubt it's going to be the cryptocurrency which will break into the mainstream. I could absolutely be wrong, but it's why I'm deliberately avoiding any significant long exposure to Bitcoin and instead am only using it to buy a couple alts.

I second the recommendation to avoid them. Different reasons, same basic principle. Their support has not been good for me and their withdraws have been inconsistent.
To give them their due, they've got a lot of volume and sometimes they work fine.
Just as a for instance: I've been tempted to deposit again to get some cheap coins now and again. But then I notice that my account is saying gibberish like "$-1173 withdraw limit" and I nope right the fuck back out. They're quick to give excuses and blame others on any issue, but the fact is they have had bugs show up in important areas like withdraw.
There are better options.
@_date: 2015-10-03 12:28:13
Or, third option, you leave the block reward schedule and total coin supply unchanged but pay it out twice as fast. Also has its problems, just thought I'd point out there's another way of doing it too. :-)
Also, changing the block frequency has implications for security as well (proportionately less hashing per block generated).

Or something like that.


growing for the past ten thousand years. It will take some time for Bitcoins to
acquire that reputation. We don’t know how to quantify the value of gold’s
reputation, but this reputation is probably the main reason that its value is 60 times
that of silver. If we were to assume that Bitcoin were to eventually acquire the
reputation of silver (which is an extremely ambitious assumption), this suggests that
Bitcoin market capitalization for its role as a store of value could reach $5bn.
By the way, $5bn is not too far from the current value of total US silver eagles
minted (since 1986), in our view probably the most relevant comparison to
Bitcoin, that is around $8bn (12k tons).


= $5bn 
tl;dr: Clearly bitcoin is worse than gold; it must be silver. boom; store of value valuation done.
Edit 2:


don’t think this is a big advantage given the advent of gold ETFs and the ability to
move such ETFs in-between accounts. We would not assign any additional value
for Bitcoin in this respect.
So, if you ignore why it has any value whatsoever, then, as we said, our valuation is as above. Geez guys, could you at least pretend you're trying?
They basically tried to make a "conservative" guess without having any fucking clue, so they just guessed a little above what it currently is. Which is probably the stupidest and least likely "maximum" I could possibly imagine. But whatever, interesting to see they're starting to finally notice something, right?

Re the first part: yeah, market liquidity would certainly be an issue.
Re the second part: I'm no Monero expert but if I understand correctly, the whole point is supposed to be that you can receive funds from a source which has you identified without them being able to track those funds subsequently. I don't know the details, but if it works as claimed, then my understand is, no, it's not dependent on the exchange.

There are some sites which are showing the former well at this point. Some wallets manage that information well and most are getting better at it over time I think. The latter may be unintuitive, but all the more reason for there to be a nice interface for understanding it. A good wallet should make it reasonably easy to be able to see how much it would take to send a given amount with various priorities on speed-fee tradeoff. Of course, by that standard, there are perhaps few if any good wallets at this point, but just talking from a specifications/castle-in-the-sky perspective.

One suggestion I heard that seemed surprisingly plausible to me is that the real Satoshi told Gavin to go along with fake Satoshi in order to further conceal real Satoshi's identity.
The downside to that approach is that it implies Gavin's reputation and involvement with Bitcoin is worth sacrificing for a little extra confusion on the Satoshi identity. That trade-off doesn't seem worth it to me.
Otherwise, I think Gavin was just fooled by Wright because he wanted to believe Satoshi was back, and Wright is a skilled con artist.
@_date: 2015-11-29 10:44:39
It absolutely destroys all existing implementations. While the attack can be mitigated by rejecting all Opt-in RBF transactions, that still damages zero-conf. But when I talk about destroying zero-conf, I'm talking about more than that change and the other I reference and am predicting future moves like this, which certain people, such as yourself, will vigorously defend as totally unrelated to destroying zero-conf, until the system is no longer operable and LN is pushed even more aggressively (presuming they ever make that vaporware a working system).
"Totally harmless" to zero-conf to double-spend transactions. Yeah, right, of course. It's not at all a problem that every transaction done like this will be impossible to accept in zero-conf where before any transaction could be (with standard zero-conf risks). It's not a problem that the opt-in nature leads to a choice between either being able to bump transaction fees or being able to issue a transaction which has any confidence whatsoever before getting a confirmation.
And of course, it's completely unnecessary for the purpose of increasing fees given the existing support for FSS RBF.

Ehhhh, it's tricky. There *should* have been some verification of the Electrum software, sure. But as pointed out in this thread, doing that validation on a fresh computer is somewhat pointless: if the network connection were compromised to get a bad download, then the signature and key files downloaded could be presumed to be compromised as well.
It sounds to me, from what I've heard described, that it was a poor process being used, which could have been fooled by a skilled enough con artist, which Wright seems to be. The signature file wouldn't really have changed that in my opinion.
So I think there was some negligence on the part of Gavin, but this is a very minor detail at best in that story.
What should have been done, rather than this meet-and-greet, is to have the "sign this" and the response be done entirely remotely in my opinion. If the only thing being transferred were a little bit of text on pastebin, the chance of Wright being able to compromise the signature verification basically goes away. And if it were made public, then everyone can check. And lots of people using lots of different signature verification tools sounds a lot more reliable in the aggregate than trying to figure out the perfect way to configure a fresh laptop such that there is no chance it was compromised in the process.

I've never heard of that before myself. From context, they're saying they've got a fuse in the part of the circuitry that allows for reprogramming the bootloader, so when they blow it, then it is no longer possible to reprogram the bootloader (without physical modification to the chip which would be non-trivial). Seems pretty clever.

@_date: 2016-05-03 15:04:12
Sure, that's fine. If Gavin wants Wright to be his tulpa, that's his choice.
But I believe it demonstrates very compromised judgment and I think that's a problem when he was basically the only major leader of the effort to grow Bitcoin to Visa-scale eventually, as per Satoshi's original vision.
Unless something amazing comes out to resolve the many loose ends in Wright's story (and finally provide some public proof), I consider this a last nail in the "big block" coffin, because it discredits Gavin, and without Gavin, there's no recognizable "big block" leader. I mean, that was probably the case anyhow, since everyone over on this side of it had basically already rejected Gavin as a liar and a fool, but until now, I'd seen nothing that actually supported that. This episode indicates foolishness at best I think.
The only other explanation I can see is the one suggested that perhaps the real Satoshi told Gavin to go along with this as more cover to hide Satoshi's real identity, but that seems like a waste of Gavin's reputation to me.

[[citation needed]] (for the first part, not the latter). Do they accept *all* checks, or only locals, or at their discretion? And major corporate retail franchises undeniably do not accept checks most of the time.


I'm not sure how you think this is an argument against what I'm saying. If you think I'm saying checks are a reliable means of payment, you didn't understand my comment.


Right, even opt-in RBF beats a check. I agree with that.


Yep, I agree.


I think it'll be interesting to see them try the first few cases like this. And I do think some merchants would stop accepting zero-conf opt-in RBF as a result. If you write a bad check, that is clearly a crime, but that doesn't make checks accepted everywhere.


Morally no different. Somewhat different simply because of the general lack of understanding of Bitcoin compared to stolen credit cards or fake checks.

Do you remember the guy who claimed to be Satoshi in December of last year, and had fake evidence to back it up? Well, he's back, and claiming to be Satoshi again. This time, he got a bunch of media attention, did some demonstrations he claimed proved he was Satoshi, and managed to convince Gavin as well.
Now everyone's trying to figure out if Gavin is incompetent or in on it, because most people with two neurons to rub together figure a known fraud probably isn't Satoshi.
On the other hand, if a liar, tax cheat, and general crazy person is Satoshi, well, that'll be big news too.
Gavin also was highly impressed with Wright's intellect, for what it's worth.
For perspective on my biases: I used to be basically Camp Gavin, in full support of BIP101 and convinced Core was terrible for not listening to their leader, and that Gavin should never have stepped down. While the more cautious consider it hasty, I consider what has already been said, without any public proof to back it up, to be damning, and I no longer trust Gavin's judgment.

Some of us are pretty big on the whole fixed supply thing too, which would not be automatically implied by censorship resistance.

Your entire estimate is based on operating cost alone and ignores cost of capital equipment, namely, the miners.
And, yes, that's marginal cost and the market could be in certain extremes, but it's not going to hold up as an equilibrium because people won't keep buying hardware that will only pay for its operation but not its purchase price (at least, the volunteer/subsidizing mining of that sort would be very different in terms of scale and hash power).
Including the cost of the hardware would significantly improve the analysis.
With that said, certainly, I think your central point that Bitcoin should strive to increase transaction volume rather than fees is spot-on.
@_date: 2015-10-03 12:32:18
It's a security trade-off. And being one of the core, basic parameters that was there since the start, it would be exceedingly difficult (read: nigh-impossible) to convince even 50%+1 (by any means of counting) to go over to that.
Many/most altcoins have different settings on block rate. 1 minute is somewhat common. Faster than that is expected to cause greater problems with propagating blocks quickly enough (increased orphan rates).
Also, consider that your suggestion would not put to rest the "never ending" argument for long: it would only double capacity, and so would be the equivalent of raising to 2 MB, which is generally seen as a weak solution because it would require another hard fork again relatively soon.

I'll try to take a stab at this. So, this is basically a computer science question. We're designing a system to accomplish a given task. The way bitcoin works is one possible solution. It relies upon "proof-of-work": anyone who gets a valid solution can add to the chain.
But we could imagine a different way of determining who gets to add a block. We could have certain keys which give that authority. The "federated" part refers to having various different independent actors whose keys are authorized by some central source. So basically there's some master key issuer and various different authorized signers. This is the same type of key management used for SSL certs.
So it would be somewhat similar to proof-of-stake in the sense that there's a low computational requirement, but different in that the authority comes from these keys rather than ownership of tokens.
I hope that explanation helps. Let me know if it doesn't and I can try again. Basically: there are many possible ways of determining whose "chain" (shared database) is valid. Each of these have different incentive structures. In this type of "private blockchain" setup, it is basically a oligopoly setup where the actors are all presumed to be incorruptibly honest, apparently. You'll note Bitcoiners tend to be skeptical that this will actually occur, but it's certainly theoretically possible.

There's a solid argument there, but I think the combination of the automated mixing which some coins have may have potential.

Hashes can tell you that the file you have matches the file described by that hash. But to tell that a given binary matches given source is rather more complicated. There are deterministic build processes (for instance gitian, which Bitcoin uses), but it still takes multiple people building and signing a hash, and then you still have to trust those people. It's better than it would be otherwise (with a typical build process, the same source could produce numerous different output binaries depending on the build machine used, even for the same target), but it's still conceivable to be attacked (for instance, the typical setup still uses a central source for those signatures, so there could be collusion to falsely sign that a given source outputs a given hash and disallow any disagreeing signatures from there; however, in a popular enough project there is then a reasonable chance that someone would build, notice the discrepancy, and post it somewhere outside the conspiracy's control).
tl;dr: Verifying that a given set of source matches to a given output binary is non-trivial. Verifying that a file has not been corrupted randomly in download is trivial using hashes.

There are a lot of different views about what Bitcoin should become. Even if people agree on a few objectives, they may disagree about what weight each of them should have.
Not everyone agrees about:


Such is life.
I don't see it as an either-or situation though. I think it's strange you're presenting it as such. Bitcoin core scaling, block size increases, and lightning networks may well all be important. So the "alternate solutions", are not what you imply: I haven't heard any of them suggest they want to prevent a lightning network type of solution.
But lightning network is not running code. The block size increases are relatively quick changes which could be done with consensus, and in fact, they would help to enable additional transaction layers on top, like lightning network, since it would help to reduce the crowding in the blocks and pressure on the transaction fee.
Edit: What did I say that was so controversial? I haven't been following the last couple months, did lightning network come out as code? Something else?

This is actually correct in a sense. I think you got downvoted because people didn't like calling it brute force or took "faster" to imply it's just faster at doing the original algorithm. Quantum algorithms are strange, probabilistic things which work very differently from classical algorithms.
But ultimately, I think it might be fair to still call it "brute force" by a certain sense of the word. 
It would also be reasonable to reject that interpretation too on the basis that conventionally "brute force" tends to basically mean a complexity of the number of elements input (n). If quantum computing can do it in log-n therefore, it might be considered inherently "not brute force" since something (quantum effects) sped it up from the naive approach.

My withdraws have worked lately. However, I would still caution people to avoid Cryptsy because of numerous previous red flags. I have also heard of other people having withdraw issues.
I think the coins I'm withdrawing they aren't short of, and my volumes are small enough to not be a problem for them. I suspect it's larger accounts with issues.
But I have no idea. That's part of my problem with Cryptsy: they'll have the most bizarre issues and then seem to work fine, but with no explanation or resolution. For instance: one time I had withdraws not working. I complained to support enough that they finally did something about it, only they then withdrew more than I had of that coin so I ended up with a negative balance of it. Obviously, that should not be possible. I had multiple times where they only sent half the requested withdraw amount, but this only happened with large volumes of the coin.
I'm impressed that they quickly resolved your issues. Cryptsy support was not as efficacious with mine.
edit: But I'll also note that there are others who I respect as well who don't have an issue with Cryptsy. Notably, I respect the opinion of prohashing and they've said they aren't in a rush to get off Cryptsy. I still think Cryptsy has serious issues and won't survive 2016, but I could certainly be wrong.

@_date: 2015-03-07 19:31:14
I think that's an excellent argument. But I'd like to throw in my 0.02 BTC on the subject of altcoins.


I generally agree. I refer to the bitcoin fork coins as "clonecoins" and for this category I think you're entirely right. Nonetheless, I think that clonecoins can have complementary value to bitcoin, for instance as an introductory currency. It gives an opportunity to use bitcoin-as-a-technology with a different skin for far cheaper than throwing 10 BTC around on the network just for a test transaction that doesn't feel like nothing. [edit: yes, that's painfully hyperbolic, of course a person could just transfer some 0.1 BTC around to themselves or friends to test out BTC, although perhaps we want to consider a target audience where 0.1 BTC is a significant sum (and frankly, to me, it's far closer to significant than nominal) and what if USD/BTC were to be at a higher level? ]
I know it's silly and psychological, but people react differently to 1 million A, 1 B, or 0.00000061 C, even if each of those have the same value because of exchange rates behind A, B, and C. Personally, I'd incline towards 1 million A.
It's edge cases, and it's not threatening to eat bitcoin's lunch by any means, but I think that bitcoin as a "gold standard" implies precisely what has happened: an ecosystem of silver, copper, etc. The peasants throw around some copper for fun but everyone wants as much gold as they can get.
But I do think some of the altcoins actually have some interesting innovations too. I don't think it's fair to say:


Bitshares, Nushares, Peercoin, even Ripple comes to mind to counter this. Storj is sort of an edge case, since iirc they plan to base on bitcoin for release, but they are currently running an altcoin. [Edit: That's just off the top of my ill-informed head; I'm sure there are more out there. Now, we can quibble about "true innovation" if you like, and then let's move onto something productive like "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?"]


I'm always in agreement with that, though I find it hard to carry out at times.
Bitcoin is bitcoin. I don't believe it's going anywhere. I wish I had mountains of it in reserve. I expect it to continue to be the leading cryptocurrency. And the clonecoins depend on that too, by the way.


Yep. The strength of the bitcoin development team is absolutely the greatest factor for its success.


I think that's probably true, and I don't foresee it as an issue anytime soon.

There's a massive gap between Visa scale and 2.7 tps. Almost every altcoin has at least an order of magnitude greater throughput capacity currently, some have far more. Oftentimes there's a tradeoff in centralization, but not always.
Raiblocks was an interesting one for this (always free transactions and no miners needed), and was being entirely distributed freely via captcha solving as the rate limiter in distribution, but it failed when abandoned by its developer as it was still pretty early on had some bugs to work out. I believe there was an attempt at a relaunch, but I was pretty disillusioned at that point with the community or lack thereof that had grown up around it and haven't followed it further.
But there are definitely coins that should be able to reach, at a minimum, 1,000 tps each.
You don't even need that though. All you need is the ability to work cross-chain smoothly. [I made a conceptual outline of this about a year ago.](  The basic concept is if you had the equivalent of 50MB blocks on 10 minute intervals (so 5MB blocks on 1 minute intervals for instance) across 100 coins, and if you could choose equivalently to transact on any of those chains, then you have 100,000 tps. Basically a sharding approach. Personally, I think this is obviously feasible as exchanges already are running something like this. An individual could choose a couple chains to transact on and a payment processor could run the whole network.
I also did a [semi-satirical expansion on this concept]( extending it further.
In short, I think it's entirely foolish the head-in-the-sand attitude in Bitcoin that somehow blockchains are inherently incapable of ever achieving Visa-like throughput. Everyone's too stuck in the bubble of pretending that Bitcoin is the only thing that matters to pay attention to the reality that (a) everyone else already has more capacity and (b) collectively, the total capacity is already pretty huge. And (c) everywhere else most of the capacity isn't used yet.
Yeah, there's growing pains in moving away from Bitcoin, but since the community seems pretty enthusiastically resolved that it no longer wants anything to do with retail or small transactions or cheap transactions, there's a hell of a lot of territory for the others to cover, and a system that's able to operate relatively indifferently to the particular coin seems likely to me to be the most effective.
tl;dr: Scaling blockchains is not the problem certain people would have you believe.
Edit: And if you think cross-chain would require a third party, then you probably are unaware that proof-of-concept of cross-chain atomic transactions have already been demonstrated and it's just a lack of further implementation and adoption, rather than any theoretical barrier. See: [CATE](

Speaking of shills though, sure is interesting to see accounts like that: 12 days old and already commenting only on cryptocurrency, with the platform that "Bitcoin is perfect and anyone who thinks there may be any issues or that any other coin could matter is evil".
