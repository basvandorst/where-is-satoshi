@_date: 2018-01-04 18:16:58
the ones doing hot recently
just to see if it can keep going up.
willing to lose the investment if it happens
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:47:19
my prayers are there for you
truly a wake up call

What does btc have against altcoins besides first mover advantage?
(I am 100% in btc but just wondering)
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:37:24
Is that good
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:09:25
Right right, thanks for the reminder, I needed that 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:43:12
Lol die
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:47:19
You sound like you read about It for an hour
Read about CMEs and futures  as well 
And uncomfirmed transactions 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:41:16
You need to do a lot of research before blindly investing at the height of an all time high value 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:57
omg bought in 154
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:55
So bitcoin can be modified? Isn't that concerning
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:01:25
ok thank you
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:08:44
I'm depositing via my bank account and still having this issue
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:50:10
Sorry I'm still not following. I didn't invest the 300 into btc, I simply wanted to transfer it into gdax. Shouldn't I get a clean 300? What went down to 281? 
Not trying to sound like a troll. I really just don't get it
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:56:36
So is there any way to get my dollars into coinbase/gdax for less thant $15/1000?
I also thought that when the mempool cleared up that the fees would drop lower..?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:49:16
Makes sense, seems there's more complex aspects than I thought. Not really sure where to start learning from! Any tips?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:40:42
I understand... but for some reason I tried depositing into coin base and gdax independently and they BOTH charge a fee.. not sure why.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:05:35
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:45:39
I don't really understand what that means., could you ELI5 haha
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:50:08
how come it doesn't show the fees when depositing money as opposed to buying BTC directly from debit card?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:57:41
Ok thank you for your time
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:34:18
so how come this?
I just initiated a transfer for 300 dollars from my bank account into GDAX and i got this message:  "$281 of $5,000 bank limit used"
wheres the other 9 dollars?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:00:51
Mempool? Sorry, a little new here:)
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:24:59
they want my tax ID number or social..?
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:42:54
mastercards charging me ontop of this?? i didn't see those charges anywhere.
and why is it 30 more than market price? i don't see that
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:58:43
I gotcha. I guess I'll have to wait until the money I deposited shows up
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:22:37
so are you saying that on coinable, I can deposit 100 dollars into USD wallet from my bank account (4 day delay) without any fees?
I just deposited 100 dollars into GDAX and i was charged 4 dollars.
I was also charged 4 dollars when I bought 100 dollars worth of BTC straight off coinbase using my debit card
