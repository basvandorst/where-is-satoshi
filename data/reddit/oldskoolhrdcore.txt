I bought 1 coin at £15k and I'm still HODL... It's hard not to panic as it's some of my savings, currently I'm £6k down on my initial investment,  but I promised myself to keep going to the end of February and see how it goes, I've written off the 15k in my head, only way I can cope lol but crypto is the future and bitcoin HAS to work or it'll be a long long time before readoption of any crypto currency... That's why here in the UK the propaganda towards bitcoin being basically 'Satan coin' is so strong, the establishment hate it and they want it to fail

Thanks you too... I want as smaller mortgage as possible, or if I play it right just buy outright, then I can just Potter about till I die only worrying about other bills

Yes I've read about that... I'm in no hurry for a return, it was money just sitting dead, all I'm doing is saving for a house and still have a good chunk in fiat, I think at least 3 years till I'm ready to plunge into property, with that in mind I think btc should be at least equal to my original investment

My only ever investment (apart from my own business) I was going to buy gold before I was told about btc in October 2017, I knew it existed but I had it fully explained to me and it seemed a good way to get some cash out of the business, then I saw it rocketing and went for it lol

Knowing myself like I do, I know that when it exceeds my original investment, I will leave it in, I'll want to know just how high lol, but you're right, it was a lot less stressful the last week when I didn't look.. And since I know I'm in it for the long run I should just set brain to ignore..... Though I do enjoy reading the crypto reddits lol

Fingers crossed, I think I'm in it for the long haul now, the FUD fuss made by the establishments of the world over btc makes me even more confident crypto will succeed

Haha I bought myself a bitcoin t shirt, that makes me feel better, didn't cost me 14k either.
But yes, I HAD to have a whole coin, my minor ocd does not allow any less... Besides, who wants to boast at parties they have a bit of a bitcoin lol (I don't go to parties lol)

So I bought in at £14k (but invested 15k),  I've tried not to check daily and haven't checked the price for a week or so, only to check now (I couldn't help it lol) its below £6k, so currently 8k down on my investment ... I've not really got any choice but to hold now, selling now would be suicide, 6k isn't going to mean fuck all to me if I cash out for fiat, £15k however does.
I'm not rich by any means but I've already written off the whole 15k (I wrote it off before I bought btc knowing it's a big risk) and it won't make any difference to my life, it'd be nice to see it again though lol *crying*. Fingers crossed for a big rally later in the year but the bully whales aren't getting my 1 whole btc lol

Bought 20k worth at the very top, I'm hodling hard with my friends laughing at my current loss lol... I believe bitcoin is part of the future though
