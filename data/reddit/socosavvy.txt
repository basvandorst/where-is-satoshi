I'm not a noob lol, I use authy and have to enter a new 8 digit code every time I login.  Coinbase told me API was hacked. I don't get it.  Wouldn't they need to know my password and authy code to access that.  I'm starting to think it was coinbase who took it.

This is the address that the 1.3 was sent too without my authorization. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:23:03
I changed the password yes. I also had two factor autorization turned on. How the hell is this possible.  Will coinbase even take time to look into this? Or am I just effed?

why is breadwallet so much better?  The reason I use blockchain is because it's the first wallet I got when I started.  I also have coinbase but I only buy my coins there then transfer them right away, because I had 1.3 phished from my account awhile back.

Sushi i'll take a donation for noticing your name.  It would be my first bitcoin seeing as how coinbase just cancelled my transaction.  The last three days i've been refreshing my transacions hoping to see cleared or whatever it says when its finished.  Anthing than PENDING.  Gosh im in a horrible mood right now.  I want me some BTC soooooo bad.

UPDATE.... UPDATE....
This will not be my last post on this site because I just scrolled through SGTFUCKFACE previous comments and found out he does this to everyone who posts something new.  Seems to me like hes a jealous little scum who is always late to the party.  I hope you wake up one morning with 0 coin in your wallet
