I agree - BTC is much simpler to spend and donate when you have it set up.

I reached out to one of the founders on this forum - hoping to offer a follow up with more info about the team soon

+0.5 BTC verify
Hope I did that right - sent to your BTC address...
Jason what you're doing is incredible. I'm in awe of you and of this community.

The Tax reporting would be a concern for sure - I wonder how Khan is planning on doing it. I'd say they are a pretty big charity though. Perhaps the Tax breaks that charities get would make the Tax implications of BTC simpler.
Also agree that loosing out on Gift Aid would be bad, if BTC replaces a large amount of GBP donations, but, if people wouldn't have donated at all if not for BTC then it would be only a good thing like ButterflySammy said. 
I think there is an element of benefit from a community perspective also - a BTC backed charity would get a lot of attention from the BTC community, and from the press for taking BTC.

Any other suggestions welcome!

True - but wouldn't it be awesome to see them (or another exchange) take security to another level.

Take a look at Havelock Investments:  Crypto Finance is on their homepage

The article mentions [Bitcoins in San Diego]( - might have some food places on there.

:) only if the US Government allows people to freely trade in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2013-08-16 06:04:26
Fair enough :)

I use a UK account to by BTC with Bitstamp and the fees so far have been very low so far - bitstamp themselves charge around 4% on purchases in commission, and the SEPA fee (if there was one) was so low that I didn't notice. 
Looking at the information they give on the withdrawal and deposit sections, it looks like an international bank transfer fee (for a withdrawal) is 0.09%, or $15, whichever is higher, but no mention is made about SEPA fee. 
my bank did charge me to send money to Btistamp, but only 4GBP.

With the recent ruling in the US that financial services are vastly overcharging people for spending their own money online, will we see an overhauls in the way that charges are currently applied?
And how about Bitcoin? Charges are lower when they are applied at all, transactions easier, and if the right measures are taken, safer. 
I think Bitcoin wins!

Did you read the article?
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:40:26
I think writing about, and discussing, something interesting in this space is worth doing. 
Sure, it might not work. People said, and still are saying, the same about Bitcoin itself.

If you are able to vote in the US, get hold of your Congressional Representative, if you are not, get US based friends to do so!
The [Bitcoin Policy Primer]( is available to send to the policy makers, which offers a balanced view of the operation, opportunities, and concerns around Bitcoin. As it was written before Germany’s “Private Currency” announcement was made, [here]( is an article on the announcement.

Totally agree - hopefully in time measures like this will become much better known. TBH, I until I started reading this forum, I had no idea that Mt.Gox was hacked so often, or of course the extent of other issues that have been caused by users by BTC companies closing down and them realizing too late.

Sorry about that - I'll rephrase. raptorak, I'm one of the people running it - you can email us on bitcoinbulletin

Bitcoin has been classified as money - that's going to lead to regulation.
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:31:16
ha, you can send me the normal one - I'll let you know if I have any questions :)

Being easy to use will also include not being illegal. Perhaps I should have said "it will be inspected, regulated and declared". I don't see the US letting people hold value in BTC without paying tax on it. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:39:12
Well said - you fought a good fight!

With amazing news from SeansOutpost, Khan Academy accepting BTC and BTC based Charity, BitGive announced this week, Bitcoin looks like a fantastic tool for charity.
Which other charities would be a great fit for BTC?
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:21:06
Hey - sure, feel free to send a press release my way. If you send it to bitcoinbulletin I can pick it up there. Let me know when you send it so I can check all folders?
@_date: 2013-08-02 17:19:03
Leaning towards commodity, but, maybe it's a new thing altogether and we should stop trying to classify it... Just a thought.
@_date: 2013-08-15 13:56:19
No, but there is certainly trouble between traditional banks and Bitcoin currently - there is space in the market to solve those problems. Someone has to go first to try and figure out what possible solutions there might be. No one changes anything without trying.
