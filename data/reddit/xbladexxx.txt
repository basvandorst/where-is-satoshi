i agree :) but you know BTC have to fall enough to wipe out those who don't want changes and are for pure money. So miners of BTU will be wiped out question is where at 250$ or 1000$ or 5$ and alts will take over party.
BTC is not in 2013 environment alts are faster cheaper so who will borded BTC plump exept BTC users fucked up by BTC popularity
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:35:24
looks  like we are at 999KB limit what now ?
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:01:30


he stil own this
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:05:11
ok :)
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:46:27
nach more like 800$
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:21:43
my target was 20% but i sold most at 0.18 :) and now 30% left if they try pump harder. Some one lost a lot of money moving that alt up. It was like 1 bilion of fiat or more.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:18:15
less drama more HYPE - like always
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:27:30
So far they have burned a lot of cash trying pump BCH :D this is so good.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:02:41
95% coins mined... then they HF it adjut simetcrilacly. Once they will have like 97% coins mined real pump will start. But til that inwetors will lose a lot of cash.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:06:12
and more tx :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:09:51
le them mine all coins in 5 years instead of 120 :D  / real economic code
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:07:42
so just imagine central bank pumping shitcoin to btc:shit ratio like 1:100 and almost all btc miners go away :D
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:47:10
i theory now will be less dumping from miners so price should go up but in reality that what is mined its smal fraction like 0.1% of daily volume so minnig itself have no power over market. Now you will have few days with blocks like one per hour so if I were pumper I would pump no because not many will get coins on exchanges on time ^^
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:08:26
:D this wealth is not for free they get it from holders
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:42:33
And Antpool is mining 0 tx blocks... what to say... IMO POW is broken as system I don't see it as honest security feature nowdays. POW gives best coin distribution but as security is flawed. 
After what i see in BTC/BCH is anougth for governments to give miners to mine coin that is 100x more profitable(some Government BTC fork) and old BTC is almost gone and unusable.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:16:14
one more thing you know that all mined coins during that period will be worth 20m$ (2010blocksx12.5 coinsx800$)... so cash volume is 1000 day then **this is JUST 2% of daily volume - THIS WILL NOT EVEN scratch the price.** Do you agree ?
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:58:30
Failed ? They are profiting form mining... they took down BTC hasrate -50% and full mempool rise fees while they mine BCH and get more $$$ from it. 
They have BIG profits. For them this is succes mate.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:12:11
this is not time but 100blocks and now they mine 45 per hour ;D
so they need like 2h.10min to dump
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:52:57
nah mate. BCH is designed to give miners opportunity to choose HOW much they will earn they can mine like 1 blokc per hour or 100 . In long run is not sustanble. They can mine all coins in 5years ^^ this way
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:12:24
:D sure like LTC and Doge
@_date: 2017-08-21 23:04:43


Not rally if 1 entity controls minning at loss they will slowing blocks after that they will mine fast and repeat process all time in such scenario you won' never get good price adjustment.
PS: In interest of miners is levering diff.
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:03:47
for miners this is deal for holders sucks.
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:38:00
impossible you count difficulty and that empty blocks just increase time to next counting. so ant end you mine average full block every 11min not every 10min. This is BS :)
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:24:44
That is awsome i looking forward for it.
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:53:47
**Must of them was made to make quick rich mainly 1st movers/developers and insiders** BTC was juz experiment at beginning so was most fair in that matter.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:02:43
agree sad it have to go for POW/POS to be secure from centralized mining. Or we users show Jihad that dictatorship end bad or BTC will fade like is fading in market cap:
 
Some alts will never face problems that BTC have because of POS/POW enchantments or lack of blockchain.
BTC with that civil war about power will fall over time. BTC was only stron when was highly decentralized. Today mining cetralization is REAL thread to BTC.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:09:29
I feel the same like HE. When 12 people is deciding for whole network as USERs... With segwit situation in BTC is different 90% NODEs run segwit client 30% miners want segwit maybe over time someone will move towards that.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:19:08
:) man THIS IS HOW MONOPOLY WORKs you kill any competitors by bribing or killing it economically. Look how Microsoft monopolized all deskops instances in BTC we are going into DARK era or we will make revolt now and kick Jihad ass now. In year when all miners will be dependent od CHina device no one will give a shit as decentralized currency or we will show strength and kick dictator or die.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:39:43






You statement is like all central bank and goverments with they roll debt all time and increase debt celing. This is just walking around problem not solving it, how big block you need to see that that was bad direction ? 10MB ? 100MB ? 1000MB? Solving problems by delaying it is bullshit it have ONE ending a failure. Once you lose ability to download chain you are fucked and relay full on 3rd part software and attacks. If miners change 21m BTC limit you can not accept tat block at all you are victim. If you give Bitcoin to one company that is BITMAIN today you lying yourself that they will do best for YOU. Every monopoly will use power to drain you from money. Bitmain will drain you too.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:58:29
100% true :D 
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:56:00
 only one that is mining empty blocks :) - yea no evidence
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:43:52
Not really man i don't want BEG miners for changes and see them as coin government.
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:04:36
If those idiots thinks that they can control Bitcoin they are wrong BTC if needed can evolve via ETH way change POW and left them with pants down. When miners will cross line people will take actions and change even POW if needed. If you have dictatorship in POW on your chain is time to change course and fire miners like ETH did.
Some people are naive :)
BTC is not LTC where 12miners can decide for whole community as all users.
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:22:20
BU bugs everywhere... cient now miners what next ? Roger is bugged ? :D promoting ICOs on main btc site.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:12:15
We have to many such 2nd layers solution which pray to be used as BTC they are calling altcoins. There is one even much better than LTC faster block. LN in progress.
But mate I will stay with BTC and even approve fork if needed to move forward.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:58:30
because this is more about to show some people that they are not know what they are doing via simply unlocking blocksize.
@_date: 2017-04-26 23:06:37
GPUs mining is anougth to be resistant to any botnet
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:21:18
I can agree in some way about UASF becouse BTC is not about democracy but mathematics
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:57:46


Miner Activated Soft Fork
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:21:27
We have to defend BTC and show him no mercy.
@_date: 2017-04-26 08:52:39
its up to you
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:25:24
yea all those folks went into BTC at 1$ and forgot dump at 1200$ :D... he probably went into BTC at next wave that is about 250-500$ :)
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:46:07
this is obvious that he is paid : ) + he heavily invested in altcoins
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:18:06
mine as well 
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:54:50
hmmm that BU fork drama i would call it manipulation too.
But now miners will face TRUE MANIPULATORS extra ligue :D haha
their colleagues will move some money into BTC mining and kick bitmain out of road in no time :D just buy popcorn
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:42:19
How users voted :D ? Soon bitmain will produce 100% of ASICs for LTC mining that meaning without ANYchange is impossible to force. When you describe MINERs=Users then whole system suck as hell.
**Real vote is on market like ETH+ETC had where you see who won where users gone.** Roundtable where you define 12 miners as users = coin government is BAD.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:14:32
Not really with terrorist you don't negotiate IMO. For me natural progression should be 1st Sewit if that doesn't solve anything fork to 2MB (2MB is acceptable this adds about ~80GB per year to blockchain). Stupid is to surrender to bitmain terrorist. If patented tech ASIC boost won't be dystroyed we need tweak POW in way to make mining competive for all = NO PATENTS. If people build miners using BUGs then they have to be aware of risk.
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:19:40
haha who will believe that shit
@_date: 2017-04-06 13:31:24
they have 1/10 empty
@_date: 2017-04-06 12:40:37
Main reason is that with that method to be succesful you have to mine EMPTY blocks with current full block drama it put bitmain in hilarious position and explain why they mine EMPTY blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:23:41
lol he wrote that year ago and then ETH was at 1$ and BTC was at 250$ so don't warry
@_date: 2017-04-22 09:02:02
I agree with you now we see that 12Miners can be called USERS :D... and when they want upgrades they have to ask biggest miners THIS IS JOKE form decentralization.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:16:04
He want only exted his control on mining. Now he sells like 70% miners and he patented technology to use less energy. He will have bad time when people will run off his patented tech.
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:55:43
no lending = no fun 10x BTC price and 50% price crash :D
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:44:01
This is capitalism at end the winner is ONLY one. If that king will do nothing other will come and get him out. But if king innovate all time and invest will remain on TOP. Miners as BTC servant can not rule network. That is WHY i piss on that BU type solutions that will give only advantage for BITMAIN.

@_date: 2017-04-09 00:27:26
Ecsacly he goes and say X and Y and price goes up or down :D

@_date: 2017-04-09 20:07:14
When one single guy can go on twiter write shit and make BTC price crash 20% this is BROKEN system ^^ for me. This shit reminds me that Janet from FED we rise rates and USD goes UP. 
Here Jihad goes and talk we support BU and BTC price fall :D... 
Do you see similarity ?
This is pathetic man.
**BTC should be resistant from such clowns.**
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:48:53
lol no now we see that X/Y blocks were mined by XZY client.
I want be able attach my transaction to specific client !
Now BTC can be mined by diffrent clients and miners chose them why  I as user can not chose blocktype that will forwarding MY transaction ? Miners can chose I as user also want choice !
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:16:17
this proves only how broken btc POW is :D
@_date: 2017-04-06 14:50:07
i don't know if they can configure stuf or this is just "bitmain" miners feature just look at bitfury 0 empty blocks
there is something on line. 
Bitfury i US chip factory while bitmain is China one
I know that bitfury don't sell chips
@_date: 2017-04-09 20:09:20
lets burn bitmain
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:53:22


but here both sides can claim that they are USERS and they will decide for all where we go. Even having fork like ETH+ETC is more transparent way than hijacking coin and claim to be "users". In ETH/ETC real votes were pulled no gimmicks like in LTC where you have to surrender and BEG miners for approval. This is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:51:18
Current fees, but if their network become more used than BTC their fees will grow higher with LTC price anyway. If BTC won't show sign of progress people will move most likely to ETH. If eth will get critical error again then people will move to LTC. People will treat BTC as win 3.11 that can not move forward.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:26:21
bitmain cheat drama i would say :D
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:50:32
Some big player exit market, or someone with BIG pocket was hacked like last time and dumped shitload of ETH on market. Polo could be hacked maybe.
hard dumps happens mostly with some kind hacks exchange or whale.
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:04:41
Oh one more thing LTC jump was caused by adopting Segwit :) not BU(technology) every investor knows that so BTC can easy repair damage to move on. Today is not that nessesary when AsicBoost will be game killing feature then we will have to HF or SF to keep mining competitive. I can like Bitmain or not but only that part of Asicboost is worth annihilation. I belive that in long run BTC will sefend itself.
Litecoin has made  change of cost surrendering network to 12miners who call themselves government (AllUsers) :D...
They have put statement that every timne they have like 50% full locks they will HF or SF block-limit this is ridiculous. Always with such change they can add some extra features :D
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:58:55
they should go for UASF and stop that circle jerk IMO :D
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:19:51
to be fair only making PATENT useless is needed rest can stay. Mining have to be competitive for all. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:08:29
How big market share have bitmain in LTC asic manufacturing ?
I bet they are like 80% so is easy for them produce for people "weaker" asics same time they can have specially optimized one.
If they don't do it today they will do that in future you can be sure about that.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:57:38


are you sure that they have nothing there ?
to check this you will have to ask Greg to reverse engineering it.
I would not be surprised that they have some exploits there too.
That will give bitmain edge like custom firmware and stuff like that dedicated only for their datacenters.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:43:43
Maybe botnets have GPUs but not that much have best GPUs those who paid like 500$ per GPU are most likiely more aware of cyber security. Most people from institution who mined BTC was fired when they got caught mostly becouse people use those computer for since and simulation.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:36:23
Segwit will NEVER pass on BTC enjoy asicboot tech :)...
and central miner hegemony with patent.
We need core supported UASF to be able be control BTC not Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:58:50
lol there is  a difference between dreams and reality on paper you can write everything you want but you will always struggle with execution.
@_date: 2017-04-09 13:05:10
How you can be sure that Bitmain have special optimized ASICs in in their datacenters since they produce most scrypt asics they can easy do that and manipulate. As monopoly they will do that like with BTC this is their market strategy like you see. All centralization leads to stuff like that.
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:05:50
since 1MB of segwit is equall of 2MB so not really. It may happen that segwit block will even faster be processed than old tx becouse of traffic jam in mainnet IMO.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:04:06
i full agree this is soooo broken
@_date: 2017-04-09 14:54:59
not really i just signaling that if that civil war won't end soon there will be different environment around. And show how free market acts in general. BTC will have year max two for changes charts are clear about that. There is to many useful idiots thinking that BTC exists in vacuum.
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:11:16
Because they put 95% activate retarded threshold IMO that can NEVER be met :D.
This is like to try jump from 10 000m without para-shut ^^ - born to be fail.
@_date: 2017-04-26 07:50:14
so far only bitman has that patented tech they have like 70% ASICs on market right now but not all miners can use Asicboost but   believe after current drama all will start.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:52:19
you can have fully decentralized own LN who will not let you.
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:05:45
you start mining with -20% loss against bitmain ^^ this is recipe for losing money
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:54:15
because you can write tested code in month.. that code will carry 20bilion market. If you think that you can code faster then you should write your own client and see how fast you will do it.
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:06:17
okay so to be precise i want to be able sent transactions through blocks that signaling segwit like miners are doing today.
@_date: 2017-04-22 09:00:23
Jihan not lost in Liteccoin he established Litecoin government with 12 Users = Miners if you want future upgrades you have to ask USERS(12Miners) :D...
@_date: 2017-04-27 14:53:19
probably no fees for him if most people will use segwit that is more  space effective system 5x more transaction in segwit block = 4x more fees in segwit blocks so or he mine asic boost or grab fees.
@_date: 2017-04-23 12:14:37
I am so sad in general to see which chain is legit you need to fork like ETH. But it would be GREAT to show exploiters/patent abusers what they can exsect from network when they are go against network. We can not let that cancer rise in force IMO overtime.
Once miners will start dictating coin development direction that will be shitty and over time will leave 21m coin cap limit and we will add KYC to blockchain. Miners are to centralized to have to much power they are to easy to bribe or bully them by government.
@_date: 2017-04-23 16:56:33
If price will drop too much people will for sure 100% fork BTC(Segwit) because economical damage will be done. 
I would put like 500$-350$ to "i don't care HF BTC and move forward" - then if BTC will be attacked by Jihan then we will welcome POW change.
@_date: 2017-04-25 09:51:47
but is this possible today ?
@_date: 2017-04-08 20:33:34
that i very good point
@_date: 2017-04-07 19:35:43
With no change price will crash - BTC will be weaker than most alts in few years if bitmain will insist sitting on advantage. Once alt miners will earn more than BTC miners they will woke up sadly that will require big BTC price down vs alts. I see one opponent that is taking 80% of BTC mining $$$ income. and that alt is rising over time.
If miners will woke up to late coinmarket will flip and change old tech for new tech. And BTC miners will lose race along with BTC holders. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 14:19:26
If that is like 20x profitable that mean they will, I don't trust them at all.
This is how mining works that is why i want support people who are avoiding that ability.
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:36:05
And this is how it should work USER decide and follow then it activates. 95% activaion won't happen ever IMO.
Look like LTC can't go to 75% :D...
He told that 2nd layer he have that works now even :) Miners can not hold market
@_date: 2017-04-12 19:33:07
I am so sad... that Bitcoin has that tech on hand and won't use it ever. THis is so frustrating. And 95%... who wrote that 95% this is joke.
@_date: 2017-04-24 19:13:30
nah i bet they want segwit but they dream about bigger blocks too.
They are missing so much profits now and fresh $$$ are bypassing BTC to alts they are not that retarded.
@_date: 2017-04-22 08:48:19
Looking at how it was played i think **that way of ETH+ETC is much better after all after changes you can see where coin USERS really are.**
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:02:46
This note is typical small font :) and sounds like this is ICO is not for US citizen but if you use BTC then you know ; ) .
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:09:03


add to that where problably 60% coins taken from orginal chain so is easier to pump price
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:35:02
What if insted usinig majorty shit chain i will use BTC148 : ) like f. LTC and be happy from Segwit improvments. LTC have 100% bitmain mining machines power this is BS crypto.
@_date: 2017-05-08 13:55:39


And what ? BTC was correcting  from 1200 to 200 over 2014,2015 that was 2 year of bear market. If BTC now will have huge pump to 5000$-10 000$ it will keep falling over 2018,2019 to 1000$ :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 08:04:56
that is why i think 1st segwit then we can discuss how increase blocksize safetly over time vs GB price / network.
BTC have full blocks, volume on BTC went 20x since but number of nodes are not increasing. Where are those all new nodes now that when we read whitepaper should appear now :D ? Usage TC rise while nodes are falling : (... satoshi fucked up at whitepaper on that case.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:07:18
Why people tell me every day to use alts for small transactions ? If UASF will become altcoin then fine i will live with IT. Becouse that will be my best altcoin not LTC not ETH not coin of big miners. If I have to use altcoin that is not stucked and have future I will choose BTC with UASF not others alts.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:57:57
can you help how avoid replay attack in such chain split ?
@_date: 2017-05-18 14:34:48
I have to agree with you nothing in real life is perfect
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:47:50


ultimate goal of all crypto investors is to be rich you will only be rcih hane you hold many $$$ in pocket having altcoin/bitcoin is usless in 99% cases when you want buy house / car . So people who had BIG gains in alts want cashout those alts for fiat. BTC have multiple ways to cash out and not make bank transfer while other alts have not such oppurtunity. Making more $$$ is goeal of 90% investors and making more BTC is goeal of 10% speculators that is why you see alt dumping now. All want big chunk of fresh $$$ : )
@_date: 2017-05-28 20:44:22
Like satoshi wrote better coin will replace BTC :) will see what that will be
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:14:35
With higher BTC price all altcoin holder will want exti to $$$ and via BTC&gt;$ is best way to do it in 99% cases
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:58:53
Just to show that it works and is not disaster. Segwit is activated on multiple coins not only LTC.
LTC is LTC it will live on its own but it will laggin BTC becouse of inflation and being just pure copy of BTC with tweaked numbers.
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:25:01
But to be honest is better to have like that two parties like today that watch hands from boths sides than have ONLY core and only Miners side - where is decentralization then ? If we will have one dev team + one miner there will be no decentralization because all parties loves each-other and this is BAD. With HF they should add some good killer features on top of BTC :D
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:14:38
or maybe they will fork again and there will be 3 etherums ?
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:25:13
if would call computer that take action every 16s that will be slowest computer in world (this is ETH) and mobiles 10 years ago were faster. Can you show me any working on ETH chain DAAP now that use their chain ?  People doesn't know that is ETH, they doesn't know that they chain even not really used have 100GB+ like BTC over 10 years. With rise amount of data needed will grow exponential.  Today is hype and hope for future same like dot.com companies but scale is much lower than then.
BTC is less comlicated and have one purpose to be E-gold and deflationary money while ETH some magic system where problems doesn't exist. I wish them best but i keep distance I just don't see that working on scale that they want it to be.
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:42:33
But they won't get all anyway. There are trade offs big block  = centralization and easy to take over by governments ext.
Users don't want big centralized coin mozst of us invested in decentralized system that can not be stopped by my goverment.
Datacenters are easy to ride by state and put rules on them.
BTC was not planned to be paypal2.0.
2nd layer will happen if we won't get now with segwit there will come full centralized "Bitcoin banks" something like Coinbase instant transaction charge backs all backed by BTC at end.
Moving everything on chain is dream that can not be real.

BTC will fork at  1 august :) bro and scale like ETC ETH did. Even if UASF won't sucseed and won't become BTC main it will be fair eviorment no asicboost - improovments - LN - + many mor features and nothing blocked by greedy miners. That will be perfect alt for people who left BTC for ETH becouse ETH have tech. BTC(UASF) will mutate will innovate system so at end it will crack ETH dominance.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:20:58
I think for people there is to many copy of copy in this line.Every coin can be annon if you mix cross chain transactions with stuff like decentralized exchange.Bitcoin&gt;Monero&gt;bitcoin and you are free of any trace.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:37:44
Ach thaaaaaaaaaat asicboost :D is sick even people areed to that 2MB then here we go what a MF welcome UASF

that is why i didn't wait to get 10x :  ) but when i saw big BTC market share drop that was time for blind dumping of alts.

I know but those 100guys are bounded by some vision while miners are bounded with another and this is good check and balance system to me.
@_date: 2017-05-02 22:27:42
I just have gave up with /btc to biased to me.
Way too many propaganda there.
Everything bad this is Blockstream/Core fault.
Here is to some kind propaganda but it have healthy balance in comments. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:30:03
but who is user and who not miners/companies/devs are HARD connected to BTC and cannot be fake. When you have like Core side vs miners that means we allways will have some decentralization instead blindy making decision like in ETH ... Dev tells X and all network goes there.
@_date: 2017-05-17 21:43:19
is better to have room for improvments just in case IMO even with segwit. 2MB is not ground breaking now to much this is 67GB year on top on second shot it give a lot room to rise . with effective space managment this is 4MB block : )
@_date: 2017-05-23 08:11:40
or they will for away like bitpay guy said - they are forced to use fork to keep business on this is not black and white man
you need to see both sides of coin

AB won't have fees and they loose advatage of +20% mostly :D 
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:04:18
THen we will use altcoin made from BTC with UASF - i don't see problem here some people want solution and they will get it. If it will couse network spilitthen be it. Lets have balls once and move forward. I wont use scamy alts I will use BTC(UASF) for transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:21:52
I agree with 2MB this is in worst case 800GB chain in 10 years, block will have space to rise and LN time to be codded and used.
We need stop 3year old child plays and act like adults.
With segwit we will solve many network issues.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:20:49
man You know how ETH works :D ? THEY HAVE TO STORE ALL ON CHAIN to be able to run contracts. ETH is like decentralized computer computer won't work without data, every move on ETH chain cost fees. Before they was seperate fees for actions and transfers but people exploited that and sended like 100 000tx/s from chain to chain bloating ETH so they rised fees 10x-20x and now you see result. ALL action on ETH cost fee all action in those DAPs cost fee... Now: Edgless casino to be run on chain have to use 2 transactions EVERY GAME... this is 1$ per game. You will ask why not lower fee... here is point low fee then you need to wait more. So  will you use lagging as HELL system ? :D... Whole ETH is utopia in many cases.
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:16:29
I don't see that entry point and risk or fail is very HIGH so bitmain will be king of the hill for a while. No matter LTC or BTC from LTC he can get more $$$ there is monopoly.
@_date: 2017-05-19 06:44:35
there was few hard forks mate :)... one when 180m BTC was mined FYI ... there were HF and SF in BTC
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:55:00
add to that ETH miners mine more $$$ than BTC today new $ are flowing not to BTC anymore.
BTC mine 3.2m$ while ETH 5.2m$...
So i would say they are winning with mining.
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:16:04
to make LN you need: timelock function and malleability fix (double spend before confiramtion) all is in Segwit upgrade
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:37:40
but market is starting mature. Altcoins can go 1000x up and 1000x down too. A point when you invest on bottom it can go lower and lower and lowet getting -50% every month/week for years.
 
@_date: 2017-05-21 10:59:43
but many people still stay away from BTC because fork/scaling that is why we are always form top bubble
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:21:31
Patents are made to maintain monopoly and cartels - BTC is not about that. Cartels bribes and poison ecosystem.

People will start using BTC with segwit support while others will stuck forever in full chain.  Man if I have to choose BTC(UASF) vs LTC (as alternative ) **I will go for BTC UASF** not LTC not ETH not any other altcoin . Even there will be BTC orginal chain around that will be my store of value that I would not touch while i will transact on BTC-UASF
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:02:32

Roger act to destructive to BTC to have so much.
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:00:37
looking at  charts then spot what is at 2nd place and this is not LTC mate...
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:22:20
and becouse of scallin most OLD BTC was dumped to alts like Roger did. That was perfect example how BIG boys and funds work they eat those emotional money, they will pump price up and you will scream how its happening , but scalling, but scalling but... who cares big biys are getting on possition in BTC. One bilion $ volume is huge.
Old bitcoins who run to ETH may have problems soon with return on BTC ship more money is in hands good speculators they will pump higher. Whales pump price it doesn't matter scaling or not. Japan goes with institutional money that is enough to start party.
If you really think that fundaments count on pump then you doesn't know crypto. Coin/stock can be moved for no reason, **whales will give you a pump reason when they will start selling** :D

**"Although many unpatched nodes continued to build on the "bad" block chain, the "good" block chain overtook it at a block height** of 74691[6] at which point all nodes accepted the "good" blockchain as the authoritative source of Bitcoin transaction history."
This is HARD FORK mate and eneded with 2 versions of blockchain with different rules on them.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:47:59
In 2010 we had blocks like few kB and not many people were using BTC. Problems are starting when you start using blokcchain for real.
Sadly for storage estimations cost of GB is not decreasing every year 2x :( but slowly breaking till we discover something that will scale better with storage today we have problems with storage mostly. The larger blockchain is the harder it will be to scan all data too over time. Im aware that big blocks will bring problems overtime. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:59:46
don't trade there : ) go on kraken +10$
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:25:02
don't go to far... even bitfury is after solution that is really needed, do you will risk 2MB for what ? Just take in notice that network will fork to 2MB sooner or later. Why we want to divide community because of particular people EGO . In 5years from now there can be no bitmain with 1TB disk you will be able to run full node over 10years from today I don't see real reason why keep 1MB limit forever. Just let Segwit work and see what is effect then we will go for HF like 95% so protocool will upgrade smoothly.

@_date: 2017-05-30 21:33:20
yup it hurts hard distribution of coins and decentralization at end.
This is no wonder why ETH is so popular becouse it can be mined by regular people all time BTC POW is flawed but at least 75%coins was mined out.

People won't see problem till once boutiful day critical error will blow up BTC system becouse X feature was used by hackers to stole some money from you or exchanges :D
then people will woke up too late and see when price is crashing and then people will relize why Core devs were good at protecting their saving.
Most people are dumb but those who are wealthiest are not dumb. 
No one will put 100m$ in unseciure system that fired developers who lead it to success and few years without ANY system emergency.
This is unpresented to software look at whole Windows constant updates, rasomware...
Without core devs in i would probably reduce my BTC explosure to 1/10 becouse system will be much more less secure.
You can not replace hudndred of hours of Bitcoins codding experience with few new people and expect doing nice updates without bugs.
This is BS to project that carry 40bilions of USD.
I won't sit on BTC and see how BTC imlodes like BU client was imploding.
I would rather buy some shitcoins,
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:19:20
2MB is not game breaking to be fair if will be pulled later in 12months when we see that we need more space. Then HF fork with 95% can go it. 2MB is 74GB year so one 1TB disks will be filled in next 10 years so i will say it it safe from bandwidth side and disc space. For me if its safe today it will be safe in 10 years. To get more MB blocks we need bigger pies i can see them coming with LN nodes to BTC and BTC network can nicely grow. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:14:59
but if government want destroy BTC this is best way to do it : )
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:15:28
I think same way centralization here is biggest problem but lests be fair we need more development team. I rhink flw is in POW it should include like 1% tax for used soft implementation for developers to create for them environment for improvements.
We waste to big energy for minning and not developing thing.
Key factor is how make development fair and profitable.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:23:32
Since HE ONLY make asic for LTC :D then guess WHAT :D ?
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:56:52
if 95% hash will go to HF as they want then what ? Users won't cry about 2MB deal 2MB is quite fair this is at max 74GB year so we will have 10 years to feel 1TB disk...

Casino time is slowly ending mate now bleed time will come for a few years.
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:15:18


Okay and no they have HIGH fees - win
but same time ETH mineres are getting minning 2x more in fiat
becouse Etherum chain is faster and cheaper.
Yea they have +20% profits but because of then lagging development competitors are taking nice edge in technology like eg. smart contracts, database solutions. Miners becouse of stopping changes to protocol can see now that:
this is obvious fippening in blockchain usage and blocking LN just helped ETH develop ICO side on their branch. 1/10 daps will live but it will provide real demand for alt currency.
As you see greed is bad and becouse of fees they mine 2x less than 2nd crypto currency miners just becouse they blocked fixes.
Is that win for BTC miners :D ?
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:10:18
I don't give a fuck to them if they strike like that then we will change POW and show them middle finger : ), like i say i would use UASF than LTC ETH to something it doesn't matter to me if BTC with minority miner support will create altcoin most morons want me to use their pumped alts I say "NO".
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:26:04

since 80% miners declares segwit support we are saying check : )
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:10:37
nah you don't get it if you have 2 channels off-chain and onchian that will balance prices .  If only one side will get massive kick it will broke economy like making 2mb from 1mb will delay LN development initiative for BTC. Balance beetween LN and chain is needed.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:24:46
if you will have on chain and off chain working it will seek balance. If fees will be to high people will more use 2nd layer till it will balance system. and fees will be balanced at some point you won't be able create system that is decentralized and have empty-blocks if we jump new shitcoin every year then yes :). 
"If blocks are full on main chain, than the fees are going to keep increasing." - yes but most people will use very advanced 2nd layers that will pay a lot miners. layers and miners will have money to improve overtime. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:29:44
since when seg2x is mature solution and tested ?

@_date: 2017-05-30 21:12:56
happend but to be honest miners will be hitted the most now they **BTC mine almost 2x less in fiat than ETH miners.** New money are not parking in BTC like it was before- BTC is in civil war for 2 years.

"BU sponsored thed is here 2x day :D" - this is ridiciulus Jihan want take over BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:42:02
they faster adapt if you say so while BTC is sticking their games and kiling bitcoin at end. Sad is that i am happy that ETH miners are getting 2.3more fiat for mining than BTC. Bitmain have to see that his stalling poplicy is failing hard and his plans to LTC be 2nd coin failed. Longer it takes the harder for people will be swith back to BTC. BTC is tarting to be very unusefull coin to buy/sell. Is good for holding value but i BAD for any tips / gambling / buying under 100$ : ). Miners are getting rich by HIHG fees ah... not really because of lost m. cap and malevibility bug BTC adoption and development stopped and ca not go forward. That concept they will get segwit only with + 2MB is sooo broken. 1st wee need to see how segwit works then upgrade stuff but not blindly do changes  becouse few miners want them.
That stalling is costing BTC miners hard short - long therm.
BTC is not innowator in whole system anymore.
BTC is looking like old nokia not possible to change a bit.
I just wanted when those miners will move to segwit 1:10 with ETH earning looks like good ground for changes ;D. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:18:27

@_date: 2017-06-09 12:58:45
But will his choises be the best long therm?...
Now we see ETH coining iNTO BTC size average ETH fee is arround 1$ : )... to use ETH you need load acc with minimum 3$ at start to move token we need pay fess like 0.1$ now at MINIMUM. 
This is great now in weeks we shuld see ETH POS/LN/Sharding becouse they have leader :D - yea? And gues what ETH will be pure marketing if not in 2months solves fees issues and scale. Its easy to flame BTC but now at least we can look how Vitalik is fast solving poblems and show results about POS it was talked from 2014 where is now where ETH needs it :D ?
ETH have Vitalik there will be no politic ? Look now what is happening now we will see nice BTC problems mirroring  and probably no solutions in fast time like they promise.
Now users becouse off fees are telling CHECK :D and I too.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:53:54
HF is issue when you have 20b market at stake and diffrent paries interested in diffrent solutions that is why HF is much more risk if you have HF will 80% miners 
other 20% will keep mine old chain with soft fork is realy hard to spilit chain with such marioty.
Monero have few central developers no big intrests at stake like BTC.
Look at ETH now when they will want go to POS it will create 2 new eth : ) again you will see it.
Tha is why is so big to keep all in one chain with competive mining without patented asicboost what is more important innowation shul not be stopped by exploit in mining.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:52:36
BTC infaltion is 4% now and ETH 14% so today ETH miners are creating 2x more value in $$$ than BTC. Since all dumping then ETH is eating more fresh capital. If BTC would be advancing in tech and fixed malvebity faster we would have smart contracts on BTC faster :)... but we don't   have so BTC miners are eating long therm loses.
BTC won't take contracts part from market for itself.
@_date: 2017-06-08 21:01:14
not realy bro BTC with fees is hitting point that it will be kicked out from many uses tips gambling ... so with loosing REAL market BTC will lose 1st place as well. Miners are greedy but markett will punish them and is doing that by fiat cashflow 2x into EHT mining than into BTC now. **So BTC miners are getting economical hit.**
Without advanced tech like segwit BTC will be something like Nokia, or gold coin in museum.
@_date: 2017-06-03 22:42:45
1MB should not stay forever to me but we need discution how rationaly increase size to not hurt economy it should be like increment of % of blocksize not like 1&gt;2MB but more like +50kb per months of weeks that way bocks will remain full and LN + miners will have money from it. Keeping 1MB forever is stupid but we need good way to do it not just make 2x but it should me more adjusted IMO.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:54:40
Wow : ) okay so they don't have any scaling solution like BTC fine ^^, ETH shills here were prising that  they have POS/Sharding soon in few months i mean not years.
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:46:32
some people invested in minig some people invested in BTC directly having miners doen't make you BTC director in control of BTC are
Just becouse 1miner have such influeance on market is bad.
Asicboost kills competition a that is biggest problem.
Miners aer users servant and you see that in ETH flipening.
