You should be able to recover with only Electrum. Select recover and HW wallet. This will put your seed and private keys at greater risk however. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:20:53
The selling "pre" hack raises major red flags. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 03:55:10
I intialized with Electrum. Then I tried a restore on Electrum using the KeepKey with text cipher and then when that didn't work I did without the keepkey just doing a restore in electrum by typing the seed (under the hw wallet/keepkey section within electrum).

Are you talking about the passphrase you make when setting up the wallet? If so, you *need* that to do a restore. Hope you can remember it.

I'm very happy with Trezor and KeepKey. Also heard Ledger is good. You set up the wallet with a seed which allows for unlimited address creation. All keys of addresses can be restored from that seed.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:37:04
Troll post. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:00:30
Also you probably want to move your funds into a different wallet that has a different seed than the Trezor had in the mean time. And when you get a new hardware wallet create a new seed and not just restore the old one. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:24:06
Thanks a ton. What about Electrum? Can you initialize with that as well or do you just get the 13 word Electrum seed? Or what can you tell me about using Electrum with KeepKey?

For a Trezor, if you opted to create a password, you NEED the password to restore your wallet. This is different from say, Electrum, where you can lose your password but still fully recover your wallet with just the seed.

Unless you generated your Electrum seed on an airgapped machine, or use multisig, then using a hardware wallet is more secure. A hardware wallet also makes it easier to spend than using an offline generated wallet. That said, a properly set up Electrum wallet can be just as secure as a hardware wallet. It's just not as noob friendly to do so. As the other poster said, you write down a backup seed and keep it safe. If your hardware wallet fails you can restore it by either buying a new one or simply using a wallet like Electrum.

I'd suggest investing in a hardware wallet like KeepKey, Trezor or Ledger nano s. It would also be more wise to use an app wallet as opposed to blockchain.info wallet. Bread Wallet for iOS and I believe Mycelium is the go to for Android. Additionally you could look into creating an offline wallet using Electrum, but it can be slightly more complex to set up securely and to spend from.

Probably because there's a million posts on it already and if you have questions you are free to start a new thread and people will gadly help you out. For beginners it's highly recommended to invest in a hardware wallet such as KeepKey, Trezor, or Ledger Nano S. Another good option is using Bread Wallet for iOS and Mycelium for Android. Your other options aren't quite as beginner friendly but there a several other ways to do it.

I'm not 100% certain, so don't quote me on this. But if you import a key to an HD wallet, it might not be backed up with the seed since the key didn't originate from the deterministic seed. Just in case, I would sweep any keys to a different wallet and then send it to an address on your main wallet.

Dumb post. They got rid of the aux port because it's ancient technology and not needed anymore. It's a waste of space. Simple as that. All of the devices in the picture can still be used with the lightning to aux adapter. Sad to see bitcoiners pleb out about this like the rest of reddit.

Ethereum itself belongs on the list already IMO. It forked and killed itself. Mutable blockchain is now worthless. I'd say thats a massive failure especially given the size ETH was.

Ver and his sheep followers are completely toxic to the bitcoin community. All Theymos has done is curb Vers troll/shill/fud brigade to prevent this sub from falling apart and being overran by trolls. Something any moderator of any forum would/should do. Thanks Theymos!

Doesn't mean it's not an extremely stupid idea if you have any kind of significant funds on your device.

Shitcoin scam.

Get ready to pay a premium for waiting.

Sad to see how many bitcoiners are such poor forward thinkers.

ETH is a mutable shitcoin. Looks like you're the braindead one. 
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:59:48
Thanks for the cheap BTC.

Doesn't have to be "dead" to be a massive failure. Just sayin'.

Wow, really weak troll/FUD attempt. Trolling used to actually mean something. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 20:41:48
You're wrong and I don't give a shit either way. FOH.

Steam just started accepting Bitcoin a few months ago. Buy your rig from Newegg and get games from Steam. What else do you need, really?

That moment when people stop viewing bitcoin as just a currency and see it for what it truly is, then understand that all altcoins will meet their demise.

I'm advising him to because he wants to pay with fucking bitcoin and he can. Do you have a comprehension problem?

Higher fees, longer time, lower amounts.

Seconded.

Nervous it's going to cut into your shitcoin exchange?
