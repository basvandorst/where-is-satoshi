You must be delusional. A principal does not hold any real power or authority. If he steals from students and make false claims = his ass in prison, no questions asked. Fuck that idiot

It's not being an asshole, it is making a point.
This guy got the idea that it was somehow "gambling" without even having the slightest clue about wtf it was.
He made a decision based on nothing but his own conjecture, meaning he is not fit for his job. A fucking principal needs to have critical thinking skills and not abuse his "power" on a whim.
I hope this guy gets fired

Are you crazy?
The guy ruined lives. Not just partially, completely and utterly destroyed thousands of peoples lives.
And you want him to not rot in prison?

Yea... this wont happen.
Bitcoin is a dinosaur in the Cryptocurrency world. There are several newcomers that are vastly better than Bitcoin.
Bitcoins main reason for being "number 1" is that it was first, but by being first it is also ancient technology.
NXT for instance has already surpassed Bitcoin 10fold in terms of being superior technologically

Falkvinge also has all of his life saings in Bitcoin. Everything he says should be discarded as an attempt to drive up the Bitcoin price.
Why do people even cite the Winklevoss twins etc. on this issue at all?
It's not like they are experts of any kind. Anyone can sit down and let their invested-bias talk shit.

I think you severily underestimates the value of domains.
Sure to us advanced users we don't care *too much*, but 90% of average internet users want to go to descriptive / famous named pages.
bitcoinwllra3r2.com doesn't really get as much traffic as bitcoinwallet

Reality says so.
Bitcoin still has a little growth potential, but Bitcoin still has several flaws that just wont be accepted in the mainstream. Like 51% attack, slow transactions, mining being impossible for the little guy (meaning more centralized power) etc.
Bitcoin paves the way, but a true second generation currency will eventually dethrone it. One which fixes the flaws of Bitcoin.

But litecoin is equally down?
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:08:11
Unless someone ends up with 51% of the Bitcoins

Yes of course it's hard to believe something that isn't true.
Cryptos are in the news at a rate similar to what the internet was before mass adoption.
Cryptos have more users now than anytime

From the post we are commenting on he did not return it at all.
Do I think he will go to prison? Of course not, justice doesn't work like that.
But he has no real authority in the real world, so of course you can go to the police. What will happen?
They will make a call to him, ask about the situation, he'll give a bogus explanation, they'll tell him they understand but that he has to hand it back to the kid, he does, case closed.
