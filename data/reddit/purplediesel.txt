Why would someone take the time to type all of that out and then call it "remarkably unreliable"?
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:44:16
Do we trust these hardware wallet companies because of their reputation up until now?  Couldn't they purposely start shipping out compromised hardware even with a tamper proof seal?
@_date: 2016-08-15 01:37:59
I see.  I was turned off by the title because I don't think "unreliable" really goes with a serious guide on storing value.
Do you think it's worth mentioning the expected lifespans of USB flash and harddrives?  I've searched for answers and they've ranged from a few months to 80 years!

How can you be certain you have a dumb printer?  Are all printer / copy machine combos smart printers?  Thanks!

Is the 5k users online some kind of glitch?  I've never seen over 1500 before now.

If you spend less than 120k a year on Amazon, you’ll come out ahead.

Hey where does Andreas stand on Bitcoin cash?  If you had to guess, did Andreas dump his btc cash?

Get your seed from the backup phrase in your blockchain wallet.  Take that seed over to electrum.  Making sure BIP 38 is checked, import seed.
That's if the addresses / private keys you want to view aren't displaying inside blockchain's wallet.  This happened to me with a change address.  So I used that process above.

If his students are going to be making $1000 / day, he is better off charging less upfront and doing a revenue share.

Well deserved.  I hope they outscore Mark Zuckerberg one day soon and send him in a deep depression.
And I mean each twin individually richer than Mark, not their combined net worth.

Stay away from magnets!

Seriously?  This seems to show few 5 sat / b transactions clearing today.  
What made you so confident you could get away with it?

Can someone explain why dice + dictionary is better than random names with random numbers?
I feel like a computer could guess all the dictionary word combos pretty quickly.  What if you threw in some special characters?
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:37:42
Just how?
Luck?  Was this a low priority transaction for you?
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:42:08
What is the lifespan of the device?  Same standard 10 years of flash storage?  Would exposing to a magnet destroy?

Not surprised about fiat, but how does this work with gold?
@_date: 2017-05-23 06:20:04
What's the expected longevity of the Nano S?  Is it 10 years like other flash memory?  That's not very exciting.  It's actually scary.

"Cryptographi is no longer selling Piper Wallet.  Sorry!"
Also, I don't know why anyone would trust mycelium entropy.  The code can be checked but I'm no expert in analyzing hardware.  How do I know it's not sending the keys through some other means or if it's compromised in some other way?
Amazon says Entropy not available.  Also one of the two Amazon reviews:
"Quick delivery and working fine. Unfortunately the small plastic box where the Entropy came in, was already opened, which inspires mistrust."
What would be neat is that same entropy code that would work on ANY USB flash drive!

So isn't a 30k sell a split second action?  Where in the video does that happen?

If he understood it more, he wouldn't think it's such a bad idea.

This is the second negative post on Jaxx in the last five minutes.  I wanted something for ether, but I just decided to delete it.  Their app store rating sucks anyway.

It looks like they're sold out of the Mycelium Entropy hardware.  Anyway to load the software onto your own usb device?

How is spam going to be handled on LN with super low transaction fees?
@_date: 2016-05-30 08:01:45
I got to their amazon product page and it says sold out.  I e-mailed them, no response.  Is there a way to load the firmware onto another usb device?

How can you trust that the hardware Trezor provides is not manipulated?
@_date: 2016-05-27 07:01:38
Well my mind is blown now that you mention that.  I'm not very knowledgeable about all this and all the available options, so excuse my ignorance.
I prefer to have BIP38 encrypted keys on my paper wallet.  Aren't you screwed if someone finds your HD seed written down?
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:56:54
Can you explain what is happening?  Is this mainly one whale or several?  How can you tell?

If computing one day becomes so advanced that the bitcoin security of today is questionable, what could the developers do to solve this without having to fork?

There's a good comment below the article.
"I have been saying that if an altcoin surpasses Bitcoin's market cap, I would change industry, as it would be an indicator that the market is following technology cycles, which would hurt the essential durability aspect of Bitcoin, making it unsuitable as a long-term store-of-value system, and hurting its value proposition with respect to established forms of money. Not only that, but after such an event no cryptocurrency could be expected to hold its value for long periods of time anymore.
What do you think? could the current rise of Ethereum be just a case of irrational exhuberance? a boiler-room-like temporary pump driven solely by short-term speculatory activity? In that case I would expect the market to correct to maintain Bitcoin at the top of the game within the next few months."
