I'm not OP but I've been around for 4-5 years. I used Coinbase and btc-e(when it was around for trading). When the twins and Gemini came on the scene, I knew it would be a good thing but didn't really have a reason to open a Gemini account. 
I opened one up sometime in October, got verified, and I haven't looked back. The only reason I use Coinbase now is for the minimal amount of LTC that I buy once a month. 
I don't really have any major complaints with Coinbase. I will say when buying Bitcoin or transferring funds into my USD wallet there, it started to vary on when the funds would be available. Sometimes it would be 5 days, a week, 10 days... it always varied with no confident answer that the order would be accepted(those pesky times when Coinbase wouldn't fill the orders).

And here I'm trying to decide on when I want to buy more. I think I'll play it safe... buy a little now and wait to see if it drops anymore before buying more.

I've always not cared. It's easy to not care if you invest only what you can afford to lose. 
Big deal... it dips. It'll be back and if it doesn't... it just doesn't.

My could a, should a, would a is that I should have bought more than 4 when it was hanging out between 10-20 dollars per coin :-P
I learned a long time ago... even on the stock market... profit is profit and you can't be mad at that even if it could've been more.

@_date: 2017-12-06 06:24:31
If you understand it and its benefits, buy a little now. If it dips, hold, and buy a little more.
Being a long time buyer(2012-2013), I'm honestly baffled that the price is already this high. It seemed like it would never happen. With that, the price is high but the tipping point still hasn't happened and it probably won't for a long while. It's not everywhere yet... There are still many people that have no idea what it is, how it works, etc etc. 2008-2015 might've been super early days but we're still very much in the early days. 
Whether you think it's going to be an investment store of value vehicle or a world currency vehicle, it's hard to go wrong. I say that loosely. For me, I believe in the tech. I believe in the coin. 
Believing in it is one thing. The other thing is realizing the volatility. We've always seen swings and while it continues to stabilize, I still think we'll see big swings for a while. 
I'll continue buying whether it goes up or whether it dips down. It's mainly a store of value for me right now because I only use it when shopping Newegg or Overstock. There is a fast food Chinese place that takes it in my town. I do get to use it there! I can't wait until the day I can use it for almost everything.

Has anyone ever done a study on the demographic of Bitcoin holders/users/owners?
I'd be curious to know what age ranges hold coin and how it's distributed across those age ranges. I doubt there's any real way to know for sure unless we had a poll put in this sub. I wager that there are a fair amount of "HODL" screamers that are young and really don't have much of a clue on investment strategies. :-/

I try not to pay attention to too many of those kind of predictions just because no one really knows. Just like the upcoming start of bitcoin futures trading... I think we're all interested to see what happens. 
Sure... Supply and demand and with the limited 21 million supply, anything is possible. I still can't believe it's where it's at after watching/buying it between 10-1000k for years. While going above a mil, 500k, or even 100k is wanted I hesitate to predict it going that high. It's another I can't wait to see it, but I'll believe it when it happens. Even then, I'll probably still be in disbelief. 
It has been climbing rapidly since it broke 10k so I'm not sure. Realistically, I think it'll eventually settle between the 10-15k(keyword: eventually). Since the next halving happens in 2020, we'll probably see another run up then. 
I'm thinking more in the 50-75k range by 2020 but that's just a supply and demand guess. 
It's a weird dynamic with constantly seeing articles that reference store of value versus currency. It seems to be doing well at being a store of value but I see bitcoin or crypto currency in general as a currency(and store of value). I personally would like to see bitcoin take over as the primary currency but in the current climate, it seems like it's content with staying primarily a store of value/wealth.
Before I start rambling more than I already have, I'll end this here. :-P

Same but on a smaller scale. The first time I bought, I bought 10. They were floating around 12-13 USD at that time. I needed them because I was subscribed to a website that converted to accepting BTC only. I bought more than I needed so that I'd have them. 
To be honest, at that time I didn't research them. I just got them in order to use this site. I thought it was just a new PayPal competitor then.

I haven't visited this sub in months because of all the memes and the people losing money (etc etc). This article came up in one of my feeds and I read it... so I decided to visit to see if it was posted here and what people were saying about it. 
I do believe that Bitcoin will succeed at some point. If not Bitcoin, some type of other digital money market. That point might be tomorrow or it might be decades from now.  One thing is for sure... we don't need big banks to transfer our money around. It's just a matter of when the technology catches up to facilitate the masses. 
Regarding this article though, this is a good reminder on how you shouldn't invest\* or buy Bitcoin with money that you can't afford to lose. This article paints a dark picture but it's also an EXTREME dark picture. That lady that invested 100K in South Korea when Bitcoin peaked. That seems absolutely crazy to me... but I've also been involved in Bitcoin in some way since 2012. I'm sure she saw the hype, bought in when it peaked, and now things are bad for her savings.

Did they offer the replacement or a return/refund or both? 
Just wondering. There was a post last week from someone talking about how their company wanted to accept it but wasn't sure on how to handle returns with the price changes. 
I haven't looked to see if overstock has any terms but I'd be curious since they're the first major place to accept.

I'm signed up for Circle, but I've been using Coinbase to buy coins since... well, it came in to existence.  I don't store any btc on Coinbase... maybe only around 0.10-0.15 in case I see something I want to buy.  The rest is stored elsewhere.  
With that being said, you stated: "but to be honest, people who know anything about BTC aren't using Coinbase to store anyways".  If I am to make the switch to Circle, I'll be using it in the same manner as Coinbase.  Storing most of my BTC elsewhere while having a small amount in Circle.  
It says on Circle's website that they have Android/iOS apps coming soon.  Hopefully that's sooner than later.  One of the reasons I keep a small amount of btc on Coinbase is so that when I buy something in person, I use my phone and their app to make the purchase.
Edit: Just tried my first purchase via a CC.  Very nice and seamless.  I just hope they have the mobile app out soon so that I can make purchases easier on the go.

My question... let's just say the 6 D's is the case with Bitcoin.
The jump from Disruptive to Dematerializing seems like it could take a little longer (possibly a decade, maybe a little more).
I know things happen fast, but the disruptive phase making btc more accessible seems like a good thing, but I could see it being bad in the beginning.  The only reason I have for this is, yes, it'll be more a accessible, but that might also make the price jump causing people to think the barrier to entry costs more.  
I see this as being a relative issue but worth bringing up.  We just have to keep pushing and spreading the word.
Edit: To also add, with the dematerializing phase, that phase includes not needing banks anymore.  I think that could be a problematic phase because there will still be people wanting to be paid in USD(or insert your currency here) and holding their money in a bank for a while before bitcoin catches on and becomes the norm for everyone.  It's fascinating to think about bitcoin or any other crypto-currency replacing our current currency.

@_date: 2014-06-23 19:07:59
I'm not sure how much coin you have, but my strategy is to keep 1 or 2 stored and spend the rest followed by re-loading.
That way, I have some stored &amp; forgotten about so in the event a huge rise/mass adoption does happen... I will have it.  On the other side of things, I have bitcoin just for spending.  When I order something online, If I'm checking Amazon, I almost always go to Overstock to see if they have the same item first.  Also, I have coin stored on my phone wallet in the event that I come across local businesses that take it (there are only a couple right now in my city).

I've started giving tips to people that are interested but not quite sure how to get started (mostly friends and people at work).  
I usually explain the technology, suggest they follow along with the news on Bitcoin, and give them a small tip 25 cents to a dollar.  It's awesome when I see them start to get excited about the technology.
Edit: Adding.
The new Amazon/Twitter  where you respond to a tweet with an Amazon link with that hashtag and it adds the item to your Amazon cart for later purchase.
It'd be interesting to see something like that on Twitter, much like tipping on Reddit.  Where you could @ someone with some type of bitcoin hashtag... from there they could be directed or sent to a site where they could create a wallet and redeem that 'tip'.  
Just a thought.
Edit 2: I just read through some of the comments and noticed that someone mentioned twitter tipping.  I wasn't even aware that you could tip on twitter!  Researching now!

I'm a little speechless as to why someone would keep 550 BTC on an exchange... any exchange... especially when it was around 1K... That's 550K dollars.  At least store 50% of that on a paper wallet, take 25% of it... buy a nice house or get out of any debt you may have.  Then keep the other 25% on the exchange.

Question: Since you're buying from other sites, do you take the time to write great reviews on sites where btc is accepted?
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:50:57
Before storing long term bitcoin on paper wallets, I used Electrum &amp; I keep a small amount 0.25-0.50 btc in a coinbase wallet accessible on my phone just in case I'm out in the wild and come across a business that accepts(there are a few in my city) or when I make Newegg/Overstock/Now Xbox Live purchases.
-- I store long term savings on a paper wallet.  Do a little research and ask questions if you take this route for a portion of your accumulated bitcoin.  
-- I'd say, after buying bitcoin or receiving tips... transfer them to an Electrum wallet or keep them in a wallet on your mobile device. 
This definitely varies from person to person.  Everyone has different circumstances... and if you were to buy 5-10K worth of bitcoin in one go, while you could, I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving that in a single wallet where you don't have access to the private key.
With cryptography, I'm in IT so I had a background in the security part of bitcoin, but I have to say just do your research.  Ask us questions, etc etc.  It was probably 6 months of learning a few years ago before I felt truly comfortable with where my money(in bitcoins) was.  With that being said... with so many new companies/wallets/services entering the space, I'm still learning every day.

I'm in the 1-10% camp, but it's still growing.  It's really more 5%(to see what happens is stored) and the other 5% is used on Overstock, Newegg, and to distribute whether it's via a tip online, or through paper wallets to help with explaining bitcoin to others.  
I plan to take it to at least 30%... and then as adoption happens, I will start to use more and more of it.  Ultimately, I'd like to keep 10-15% of bitcoin stored and use the rest of my bitcoin to buy everything I need.
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:59:06

It's nice to pick up more cheap coins each time the price drops.  Each week, if you're paying attention, bitcoin is constantly receiving attention from somewhere. 
The only concern that I do have is for retailers that take bitcoin now.  I hope that these drops don't scare them off and cause them to stop accepting it.

If that is the case with a bot making the decisions, I'd imagine they'll fix something like this overtime.  Maybe flag those cases, for manual review before they're actually executed.  
Right now... Circle seems like a very viable alternative (one that I've been using alongside Coinbase), but as more providers like Coinbase and Circle come in to play, I can only imagine that a few of them will be a thing of the past as things like this happen.  
In your case, you were a loyal client, but what about anyone new to bitcoin?  They don't want to submit an order for any amount of money only to be told days later that it can't be completed.  That'll turn them off immediately to the possibility of an alternative currency. :-/

Just like anything else... as more people recognize the benefits of the blockchain and the transactional part of bitcoin, I think more and more people with a vested interest in having bitcoin succeed will sound the trumpets.
We've already seen many companies add support.  As time has went on there are more and more 'ah-ha' moments.  I wonder when that will snowball?

Right here. I've been buying since 2012. Ever since the huge run up, I've scaled back on how much I buy at a time though. 
No worries at all.

Same.  I started with Coinbase before Circle came along.  I have a small amount of coin stored in paper wallets.  
I really haven't decided between Coinbase &amp; Circle yet.  I buy bitcoin with Circle, but I've purchased things with both services.  I usually keep a small amount on both services for when I need it.

34-year-old millennial here holding since 2013. 
The other thing to consider is that some of us might not be holding because of student loan debt that is slaving us. Sure... I have it too, but I still throw 20 dollars per paycheck towards my bitcoin stash. Will it pay off... maybe not or maybe it will and my loan debt will be gone in 10 years and I can easily purchase a home or something.
That's a chance I'm willing to take because I believe something is definitely going to replace cash and what better thing to be the backbone than bitcoin.

I'm beginning to wonder. I've bought at fractions at varying price points since the $170 days. This run up seems different to me. All the press seems to be good press. I'd like to see 3K again but I honestly don't see it going below 2,800 ever again. 
I keep thinking it's going to level out between 3300-3600 but it just keeps on rising!
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:51:15
I still think we're going to have an entire host of altcoins that act like smaller values. 
We'll have BTC(however high it eventually goes), LTC acting as the next "bill", some other coin acting as the next "bill", and so on. 
Sorta how we have pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, dollar bills, 5 dollar, 10 dollar, 20 dollar, 50 dollar, and 100 dollar bills. I don't see why we wouldn't have that same concept but electronically.
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:35:49
Someone that I convinced a few years ago about Bitcoin(but he never bought any at that time) was bummed the other day about it. Currently, he owns around 300USD worth of BTC and he thinks he's too late. 
I told him to look at it like this. Yeah... maybe he doesn't have an entire coin but at that time an entire coin was hovering around 32-3300USD. So he had about 1/11th of a coin at that time. Now think about if it does continue to increase which I as well as most of us here think it will. 
Fast forward 5-10 years if we have a $100,000 coin... Why that little piece he has will be around $9,100! I'm not sure about everyone else but being able to invest an amount like $200 and turn it into $9,100 over time. Sign me up. I'll continue buying fractional amounts until I can't anymore!

I figured with this drop, it'll at least drop to 6k or 5500. No one knows for sure... there is probably another threshold in the 6k range where a massive amount of people would start selling and cause it to drop to 5k or below.

If I were you with that kind of money... Obviously you're going to do what you want but I wouldn't buy an entire coin at a time. I'd say if you're going to buy a large amount, buy an entire coin in thirds. Start out buying 0.30, wait a week or two, see where the price is and buy another 0.30, repeat.
Some of us have been around for a while. We've seen the rollercoaster. BTC has been bullish for a while now. Most think it's going to keep going with no drawback. The ones of us that have seen drawbacks are prepared and have less anxiety than we did before.
One fact: It's still early so getting in now is still good but I fear that early window is closing. Slowly closing but still closing.
Another fact: No one knows what is going to happen with the price. BTC and the blockchain has a ton of value. 
While I believe in bitcoin and the future of bank-less electronic transactions, it's still a volatile asset. I'll continue to acquire coin as well as have "on-me" wallet with a small amount for when I need to use it. I would never drop the amount of USD for one entire coin because of that volitility.

Hodling is great for many, but I'm honestly surprised that more profits haven't been taken with huge sell-offs causing the price to dip.

I've had this same mindset for a while but more so with just btc and ltc. If btc is going to be an asset similar to how it's compared to gold then there has to be a coin compared to silver. You could even break that down the way we have different bills 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100.. it doesn't seem weird to me in the slightest to have different coins to conduct transactions with.

I first got in around $13 not knowing anything about it. The only reason I bought some is because a site that I was a part of was bitcoin only. 1 coin got me a year membership.
I bought 4 at the time. The remaining 3 I sold around 160-170. The time after that I spent researching and learning more. I continued to purchase bitcoin and spread the word to everyone about it. I now have a few coins that I've fractionally purchased since 2013. I should've bought more but I can't complain.
The majority resides in a paper wallet. I keep 0.30 in Coinbase for when I run across businesses that accept(there's a Chinese takeout place along with an independent furniture store that accept it in my city) or for when I order something from Newegg or Overstock.
The biggest thing I hear from people is that they think they're too late. If you think you're too late, then you might be paying attention to bitcoin for the wrong reasons. Yes, it could be replaced or fail but if you don't think the financial system is due a major upgrade or revolution I just don't know.
I crave the day that I get to take one of my friends out for lunch or my gf for dinner... And I can pay for the meal with BTC!

I tend to stay away from this sub the majority of the time. I used to check it multiple times a day. 
I've been buying since 2012/13. I needed the bitcoin then for a few website memberships. I think the first coins I bought were around 13 bucks. I knew absolutely nothing about them at the time other than I needed them for a website. After one of the run-ups to $170-180ish... I started researching and learned everything I needed to know. I started buying them periodically. Eventually, the price grew and grew. I have it set to 40 bucks a month and I've forgotten about it. 
Sometimes coming to this sub raises my anxiety and I think I should buy 100 dollars here or 100 dollars there and temporarily leave my routine. 
It's great to have this sub but there are so many people pushing numbers, charts, stories, doom and gloom, and weird predictions... that it blurs everything.

I agree with what you said but if I can add... 
We as a community try to explain it to people when they're willing to listen. We realize the potential and how it could revolutionize the financial market. 
The problem I have is 'a huge part of the population not understanding the technology'. I honestly don't think the majority of people will ever understand it. 
We need a killer app that makes it easy to obtain and use. We can put our exchanges or things like Coinbase on a pedestal but they still have their issues. The masses aren't going to care about Bitcoin until it's easier to buy and easier to spend. They don't care about the technology of it. 
Even scanning a QR code... seems easy enough but even before Bitcoin, QR codes can be annoying. 
I see something like how we have touch pay but being linked to your keys/digital wallet and doing it automatically. The way things are becoming automated... even something like that which would be linked to your keys/digital wallet. I'm not exactly sure how the verification would work though without touching something or biometrics or whatever.

Thanks for the input. It's always great to see a refreshing viewpoint. I've accomplished a lot but sometimes it still feels like I have so far to go.
I got a degree and started with A+ work doing break/fix and basic admin stuff for an elementary school. I stayed there for a few years(4) before moving on to a help desk/networking role. That company collapsed on itself so my time was short there(2 years). 
My current role is help desk/customer service with other technical things peppered in here and there. I've been here for 5 years and I'm currently building my networking knowledge to move into that world full time. 
I've had a few contract projects on the side that have been cool where I've learned a lot of information. I know a lot about many different things but there are some areas I'm completely useless with.

Good gah... but then think if you were doing $25 a paycheck or just $25 a month. I can't imagine. We also have to remember, it wasn't as easy to buy back then but truth be told... I would've probably sold the majority of that with the first run up to 170 or 1K.

If you're selling rare whiskey/bourbon &amp; you're expecting a few btc per bottle of whatever it is (for reference, that'd be 500 USD), that might be a hard sell as well. Most in the bourbon community think a lot of "premium" bourbons are overpriced in the first place.

It makes me curious. I wonder if it was just that certain branch. 
I guess I'm not familiar with how most banks manage their branches. Is it 1 manager per 5 branches or 1 manager per branch? It's likely that there is a manager per branch and then a district or regional manager for X amount of stores. 
I wonder in cases like this if the individual branch managers are making the decision or if the issue is taken to the district/regional manager and if so... Does that mean the orders are coming from the top? 
It just makes bitcoin look all the more better. Your currency is in your hands and you can spend it however. There's no middle party deciding where you can spend it!

Pro-Bitcoin here, but to play devil's advocate. 
I do agree that it will evolve the payment infrastructure. However... you can already store your credit/debit card information in apps on your phone (whether you use NFC or Fruit*Pay). 
My wonder is, if you input your card information or have your bitcoin wallet on your phone... how do the credit card companies compete with the transaction costs? Does Visa &amp; Mastercard drop the percentage they take in order to compete or do we eventually get to a point where bitcoin miner/transaction fees rise?
I could easily see some of the traditional payment processors going away. Either that, or if those traditional payment processors have to compete by dropping transaction fees, we'll probably see massive layoffs at those companies. Any idea how many employees any of those companies have?

I'm currently struggling with people jumping to another coin. I've been telling people that I work with for at least 5 years about bitcoin. 
Only one of them took interest and did some research as well as kept up with the news. With that... he only bought about $20USD worth when it was around $400USD. He has watched the volatility only to see it now sitting where it is and have regret. 
Now what's he doing along with a few other people? He thinks the bitcoin opportunity is gone and he's focusing his energy towards litecoin. I'm not sure how to explain this but I think the jumping from coin to coin or at least getting on board with some type of crypto-currency will happen in this manner. 
Once they're on board(Completely my opinion), some altcoins will die I'm sure but I think bitcoin will always be around eventually drawing more people in whether they own an entire coin or not.

Best Buy has to survive as a store first.  They've been closing stores over the years.  
I hate to say it, but I'd say Best Buy will go the way of CompUSA &amp; Circuit City eventually.  
My counter-prediction: They start accepting Bitcoin... then 3 months later they announce bankruptcy/restructuring/closing of stores.
Additional note: The bitcoin wouldn't be the reason for the bad news.  The bad news would just be because of the company.  That being said... if a news outlet wanted to pick up on that, they could try to link the 2.

I would imagine it would be like that... but maybe they'd take it from the merchant instead of the consumer.  
Don't they charge a transaction fee with USD?  I've been on the consumer end of Square but never on the merchant side......
Just looked it up.  According to their homepage, they charge a 2.75% fee per swipe to the merchant.  So it wouldn't be a charge to us the consumers.  Although, charging a flat rate percentage fee might cause merchants to pass some of the costs on to the consumers to offset the transaction costs.

I'm not hoping for a crash, but I do think it's worth more than what it is right now.  If it reaches mass appeal, then it should be valued much much higher.  
I know I'm not the only one here, but I've seen many think it should be around the 350-400 dollar range.  I'm under that same impression.  
The price will continue fluctuating wildly for the foreseeable future, but it can't continue growing the way it has in just the last 2 or 3 weeks.  From 200 to 700... if it stayed on that pace, it'd be 5 or 6K in no time (which I believe it's worth).  I just don't believe it's worth that yet.

It is almost black Friday and the shopping season. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:52:49
I see... I don't have a lot of readily accessible savings.  
My savings = Certificates of Deposit that I lock up for a year.  I have 1 for every month.  By locking them up for a year, I only earn 10% back on them which then gets rolled over in to another year long CD.  I could have longer term CDs, but I don't want my money tied up for that long.  
I started with 500/month a few years ago.  Each month I add a little to each one along with the interest that it earns.  I'm up to having 16K in CDs.  
I could cash them out, but I'd rather not.  I definitely don't want to put "all of eggs in one basket".
- With 16K in CDs (and growing)
- 10K in 401K (and growing)
- Another 5K in random stocks that I play around with. (Part of this money may be cashed out and transferred to Bitcoin... It's a debate right now)
- I have shares of my company that will be worth a lot in a few years (after we go public)
It'll be nice to add Bitcoin to that list gradually for me.  I'm 28, and my intentions are to be retired by the time I'm 50.
Bitcoin no matter how large or small a slice I have will help me with my goal.
Edit: To add, Bitcoin is kinda a for sure thing, but then you never know.  The government could get ticked in a year and come in and shut down everything Bitcoin related.  They did it to US online poker players to an extent.  That's why I consider it high risk/high reward.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:43:51
Same here.  The amount to risk compared to the reward of what it might be in a few years.  Totally worth it.
@_date: 2013-11-08 20:21:42
Even though I've been buying at random prices all week ... I'm still hoping for a pop to pick up even more.  
Highs/Lows... I'm not at all worried about where bitcoin will go :-).
Edit: The only thing I hope is that even during the pops, I hope that businesses don't see that as weakness and then stop accepting it.  They'll just have to adjust their prices accordingly.  
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:18:23
I'm not treating it like a stock(but if you do sell some bitcoin, one of the main reasons is for the profit (especially people with hundreds/thousands of bitcoins)  unless you're trying to convert to another currency, but if you're doing that then why did you buy bitcoin in the first place? 
If you do have profit from a sell, then you can't beat yourself up about it is all I was saying... But you know just as much as I do there are plenty of people here especially as of late trying to make a quick buck since the price fluctuates so much. :-/

I don't think you can form a party around bitcoin.  Whether it would be people from both parties or not... there would always be the people accusing a bitcoin party of being ignorant.

@_date: 2013-11-06 05:12:54
It's never too late to invest if you believe in it. Just think of all the outlets accepting it, news reports, and other buzz about it. When it catches on as a viable payment alternative, there's no reason it shouldn't shoot up 5-10 fold. 
I did sell 4 or 5 bitcoins back in April and earned a few hundred dollars profit. I just recently got back in. Although it's still "cheap"  compared to what I think it will be one day....  I'm buying in increments at different price points.
Just tonight, I was going to buy .30 but with the way it has been going up, I decided to buy. .15 worth.  I'm waiting to see what the price does through the night and in the morning before I buy the other. .15 because I could potentially get the same amount of bitcoin for less. 
If only I could have got in a few years ago for bucks or pennies. :-) 
Totally jealous of those of you that have a few thousand dollars worth to a few 100k to much more. So jealous.

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:34:29

@_date: 2013-11-28 14:16:24
If you do buy bitcoin now... don't buy an entire one unless you just have 1K sitting around.  Buy them in fractions.  
I had bitcoin back near the first of the year.  Not a crazy amount but some.  I sold them when it went up in April.  
That being said... I recently started buying in again a few months ago.  In buying in fractions... I managed to lock down 2.5 btc with just 400 dollars.  Obviously that's worth more now.  I do have more than that, but the other coin I have... I use.   I have a stash to use and a stash to save.
My point though... is buy it in fractions.  The price fluctuates so often that I feel more comfortable buying in 0.10 and 0.20 bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:47:20
Thanks for this.  
I had a few bitcoins that I sold back in April and have been dying to get back in.  I recently found out that you can buy bitcoin in increments which gave me the push to start buying again.

No no no. You have it all wrong. Hooker anus... There will only ever be 21 million, minus the ones that are lost, Dead, or dead inside. 
One day that little anus hole will reach the value of Gold as new people start to accept it and more people start using it. 
It should continue to rise as they become more scarce. As Hooker anus holes begin to die, more and more people will start to hoard them by way of artificial anus molds. 
As adoption increases, we should be able to take these anus holes to the moon with us via Virgin intergalactic (or whatever it's called). 
As anus becomes more valuable we will start holding anus much like gold and trading in an alt-anus much like silver. In this case, the alt-anus is called the vagin-us.

With all the news over the last few weeks, more places accepting them, positive stories on major news sites, and well, China... If it drops or corrects anytime soon I don't see it going below 350-400 per coin. Obviously we have no way of knowing but bitcoin definitely has value. That's for sure. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:43:47
True.  I don't think it's something that can be tracked over just these last few months or years.  It'll probably take years on top of years before we have anything solid.  I've started asking everywhere I go if they take bitcoin yet... from chain restaurants to the lady that cuts my hair to local establishments.  
I've had a few curious bites but those businesses haven't started accepting them yet.  I plan to go back in those curious places and ask again within the next few weeks.

@_date: 2013-11-18 04:21:41
I think it's a very blurry line. Yes,  we all want bitcoin to be a currency. That's a given. 
In a way though, we all still care about what they will be valued. For a USD comparison, will bitcoin be worth a dollar per coin or will it be worth a million per coin? (or anywhere in between) 
We could take all other currencies out of the comparison but we still all care about what the value will be. 
To further the example, what if 1,000,000 dollars only was useful for 100 dollars worth of goods, services, utilities, etc? 
Maybe bitcoin will catch on. Maybe it'll just be an alternative form of currency. Either way... Being in at the level we're at, really rewards the early adopters greatly. 
If btc is ever worth a million per coin... And you had 5 coins or more... That's huge, life altering circumstances. To that degree, let's say bitcoin is accepted by a lot of places but not all... It would be fantastic to cash out half a coin or a coin to get the things you want/need. 
TL;DR: I think that's why people do care about how high it does go. It's important in every way that you look at it. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:39:43
Same here.  I bought at 200 too.  I went ahead and bought some more around 350... and I just made another purchase not too long ago around 440.  
I keep wanting to wait for it to drop a little bit to buy up many more... but it seems like it continues to fluctuate between 30-40 (either direction) each day before jumping up significantly (by 60-70) and hovering there for a few days.  
I know there has been a lot of news for bitcoin over the past few weeks, but it kinda creeps me out that it has jumped up so much in so little time with little to no big drops.  
Edit: I just keep telling myself how much I believe in this currency.  I'll continue buying bitcoin at various price points for years to come. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:49:18
Are you saying 57 million dollars per coin?
Not that I disagree.  I haven't thought about bitcoin being valued in multi millions.  
Also, since it's going to be a long time before we actually reach all 21,000,000 coins, wouldn't that make the price significantly higher until all coins are mined?
Of course certain things need to happen with more places adopting it for the value to go up.  I'd think if a coin was going to be worth 57 million dollars that almost everywhere would have to accept it.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:52:01
I think there's more than just a slim chance for it to go mainstream.  If bitcoin doesn't go mainstream, then the technology will for sure.  
It kinda hit me the other night when I was telling my dad about bitcoin (smart guy, but not exactly tech/finance oriented).  I was telling him about it and the first thing he said, "There won't be physical money in the future". 
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:25:29
You can't feel down on yourself. Profit is profit... I learned that via the stock market from a stock that I got when it was 10 a share... I sold at 30 and took my profit. Needless to say... 7 years later, that stock has hit 300 dollars(I try not to think about it) 
If you believe in it,  just keep investing in it. It blows my mind that it has hit 300 so fast. I thought there would be a major sell off when it hit 270 and go back down. 
No one has a clue what exactly is going to happen,  but I don't see why it wouldn't continue growing as long as more people keep using it and more businesses accept it.

I feel the same.  I think Bitcoin has a good path to success so I'm here for the long haul.

Someone else already mentioned it, but with news like this... it's just another small reason not to.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:36:44
Maybe when all coins are mined.  Maybe.  
Hopefully it continues to gain adoption.  As long as adoption comes, there's no reason the price couldn't go up significantly.  People are already buying in fractions... that's the way BTC will be used so a whole BTC will be worth something significant.  
Either that, or BTC will be worth so many LTC... and everyone will be using LTC since there will be more LTC in the end(or other alternative currency).

The crummy part is only because I suspect it'll fluctuate for a long time. The purchases I made this week were down around 200 before it started it's rise. 
Whether for profit in the future or an alternative/mainstream currency stash when more places start accepting them, I'd still rather buy them at a lower price. 
That being said, next Friday is next purchase day whether it's 1, 200, or 600 dollars.  :-) 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:48:12

@_date: 2013-11-05 00:53:29
I'm not an expert by any means.  I've had experience with the stock market and only slight experience with Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin may be "cheap" now which is why I'll continue buying in increments on a bi-weekly basis.  
If Bitcoin is going to be the money making investment in the future that most of us think it's going to be... it isn't going to jump to $1K, $10K, or more over night.  It's going to be a long bumpy ride with lows and highs.  
If only I could go back in time and buy bitcoin when they were pennies.  At a price point of 200/250, it's still cheap enough to get in, but unless you have an extra 25K laying around to buy 100 at a time, the smartest way to buy bitcoin is in increments over time.  
Let's just say I have 25K laying around... I'm not going to buy all the bitcoin I want for just 1 price all at once.  I'd buy maybe 5K worth and wait a few weeks.  No one can predict if bitcoin will rise by 30 or 50 bucks tomorrow or if it'll fall back to 190 and stay there for a month.  
That being said... it's increments for now.  After the first of the year depending on where the price is at... I may begin to buy 2 or 3 at a time every 2 weeks.  
The true believers and all-to-most tech oriented individuals that believe in this currency know where it could go.  It's all a matter of buying and holding.  I'm in it for the risky investment/big return aspect.  
I'm not trying to buy a bulk amount of bitcoin right now... and sell in 3 months when it jumps 50 bucks/coin.
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:26:31
Your post is good to hear.  I'm all about bitcoin succeeding, but a few years ago I bought 5 bitcoins when they were cheap (mainly to be a part of a website that only accepted bitcoin (1 per year) so I stocked up with 5 at the time for I think around 40 bucks.  
When the initial spike happened last spring, I went ahead and sold and took a few hundred dollars profit.  
I kept watching the price fluctuate from 100-to what is now but didn't really have the extra money to dedicate until I found out over the weekend that you can buy in increments!  
You predicting $1000 by end of 2014... I hope it stays steady for now.  Next year, I'm going to have the extra money to build up a huge stash.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:13:34
I've talked about it so much that I have people around me asking me about it too.  Some of them have been more acceptable to hear about the tech specifics of it, while others just want some to use on a bitcoin accepting website, while others want some in case it goes to a crazy price... they'll have it.

I think people expect BTC to make them million/billionaires overnight when that's not the case at all.  
It's going to take years before there is an established value for BTC.  Yeah... of course, the price will fluctuate and if you get lucky, you might make some extra money, but the big pay off is going to be as adoption increases and more BTC are mined.  
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:48:29
It's really an amazing sight to see.  
I think one of the main reasons economists are so baffled by it is because they don't understand it, the technology, the potential, any of it... they just don't understand it which seems extremely odd to me because you'd think they'd be open to learning about a new currency.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:09:06
I'm with you. I do think that people not in the know, hear bitcoin, hear the price, and say, "I can't afford that" without ever realizing that you can get in for as little as 10 cents. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:46:37
I sold early (only 5 coins) back in April at the first rise.  I just recently started buying again (mainly because I found out you could buy bitcoin in .2, .3, .whatever increments instead of the full price.  
Since that is the case.  I'm building up now.  I kinda feel crummy because it continues to rise, but I do believe in it.  So much so, that I'm not really trying to profit from it (although it would be a nice perk).  If more and more places start taking it as I expect they will, I'll not only have a profit if I ever need it, but I'll also have a free currency to use wherever it is taken.  
So in a way, I guess you could say it's not only a profit (if I need it) method, but it's also an awesome savings account.  
If I could, I'd request my employer check in bitcoin... but since most places still take cash... I'm kinda stuck, you know.

It seems like a sell off might come to make it fall back to 5-600 levels... Momentarily. When it hit 900, sell offs happened and it went back to 400!
I think each time holders are getting smarter and not selling off for no reason. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:09:45
Isn't that the truth. I've been buying back for a few months. I keep telling a friend at work, buy some... It doesn't even have to be an entire coin. He keeps waiting on it to come back down. :-\

I might be in the minority for this thread, but I actually think Coinbase should have charged him his full original price. 
You're right. Coinbase does always sort things out. 
I believe in bitcoin but if I was dropping that kind of money on them... I wouldn't buy it all at once. Maybe buy 5k worth at a time over a few weeks. 
Dropping 35k to a site where mixups do happen... Just seems bizarre to me.

No-TV hipsters are now in bitcoin. That confirms it... The moon we go.

My method... I bought a few at 200, then it jumped.  I kept telling myself to wait.  
My solution: Instead of getting caught in a "will it rise or will it fall" situation, don't buy a whole bitcoin at once.  If you want to buy now at 700, but .1-.5 or whatever you're comfortable with.  If it grows by 200, then buy another fraction.  On the other end of things... if it decides to drop... you can pick up a larger portion then.  
I have coin at price points of 10, 200, 250, &amp; 280.  I did go ahead and purchase some at 512 last night as soon as I saw the Bloomberg article about the US/legitimate. 
This may seem to defeat the purpose but if you've researched and believe in this currency then you almost know it's going to increase in. value.

I'm thinking around 250-300 is the right price from now.  It hovered after April and slowly built its' way back up.  
With recent news, China getting involved and more businesses accepting it daily.  I think 250-300 is acceptable at the moment.  
I love bitcoin... and bubbles are one thing, but I'm not sure if the trend will remain rising significantly and then dropping/stabilizing.  At the moment... it seems like a 6-7 month time line.  
While not impossible, I don't see it rising significantly every time there is a bubble.

That makes sense.  Thanks.  Maybe I'll go ahead and add it.  :-)

With a story like this, I wonder how high it will go. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:03:48
I think this early in the game it's safe to say no matter what price point you buy at... you will make money.  
Since I'm in it for the long term... if I bought coin as soon as it hit 900 and it dropped all the way to 100, I wouldn't feel bad at all.  I do think BTC has major potential.  It's just going to take time, adoption, and for the community to continue pushing it.  
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:11:09
Which is why I'll continue to buy in increments.

 My kid won't have an Apple product.  I won't allow it (that is if I ever have kids).
 Kids don't deserve cell phones until they're at least driving so that you can check on them.  It's absolutely ridiculous every time I see an 8 or 10 year old with a phone of their own.  Ridiculous!

That's kinda the realization I made a few weeks ago.  Yes, they will become harder to mine.  If they are to be a viable currency and we do split them up as more people accept them/buy them, then the total of 1 bitcoin will be substantial.  Possibly so substantial, that no one person will ever have 1 in the future.  We'll all just be using mBTC.  
That being said, I'm not sure if bitcoin could be the only form of currency... but it could totally be an in addition to other currencies for sure.  
And if after splitting their value, we got to a point to where it wasn't enough... that just paves the way for other virtual currencies.  
A while ago, I read (I think in a reddit thread)... someone was comparing bitcoin to gold and litecoin to silver.  I like to refer back to that.  
Depending on where bitcoin goes with price, acceptance, distribution... I could see different currencies being in the world in much the same way that we have paper bills and physical coins (pennies, dimes, nickels, quarters).

Unless you can find me a 60 inch computer monitor to watch those TV shows on and play those video games on... I'll still always have a huge screen somewhere in my house. 
That being said... I've always had a TV in the physical sense, but I've never had cable.  Don't need it.  
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:19:58
I've never had any issues either.  
It does kinda freak me out when I see all the Coinbase posts.  I don't want to have problems in the future so I'm going to go ahead and knock on wood.

I use coinbase, but right after I purchase them... I transfer them to another wallet/create an offline wallet. The ones I'm holding stay in the offline/cold storage wallet. 
The coin I use for buying things with, I keep in a local wallet file. 
I also have a small amount of coin in one of the exchanges that I'm constantly paying attention to to try and make money. I started with...    .10 in the exchange and have worked it up pretty well over the past few months. With that extra bit about exchanges... Whatever you do, don't store any longterm amount on an exchange. You never know when the exchange or broker could shut down and leave you coinless. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:17:21
Question: I've been buying from coin base from a while. I have L2 verification but haven't added my bank/credit card because I've been pretty happy with the week turnaround. 
My question is their extra fee for insta-purchases. I think it's 3.1% and some change. Where I'm buying in increments, the minimum is already around 50 USD. For me, I don't want to be charged an extra 3.1 percent especially when I'm making 3-4 purchases a week.
Do you think the insta-convenience is worth the extra fee amount?

If I received a letter like this from my bank... I'd be absolutely furious!  
What, so I can't use my money the way I want?  Kidding me, right?  A letter like this would require a trip to the bank throwing the letter in their face and withdrawing all of my money... all of my savings(which is starting to be substantial) and closing my account.  
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:31:53
Considering you've had so many for so long... I'd say keep them. If you need 10 or 15k to pay off some debt or just to go on vacation, then do so... But definitely don't sell them all. 
If you've been away from the community for a while... There are good things happening almost on a daily basis. The price (can't say for sure because no one knows), but the price should definitely keep going up. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:12:51
Are there any numbers regarding businesses that started accepting bitcoin and then gave up on it?
I'd be interested to know how many merchants have/are going to pick it up but the adoption by civilians still isn't wide spread and then they give up on it.

That's what I'm trying to do.  I'm building my BTC up so that I can start shopping with it.  
I would now, but I don't have anywhere near enough to shop with just yet.  I'd rather have 1 or 2 to keep, and then shop with the rest.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:19:53
Someone else mentioned... Buy, Hold, Accumulate.
I do that, but I do have a small stash (.20) that I use to trade whenever I feel like it... kinda for the fun of it.  
Recently, I've been taking the profit and shifting it to LTC (because I believe in them as well).  
I don't think it's a bad thing to trade, but I do it with coins that I already accept as being lost.  Fortunately, I started with just .10 and with all the recent huge swings, I turned that in to .20 and some LTC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:38:15
I managed to sell a portion of my BTC at 500... and bought back in at 400.  
I just as easily could have lost money, but I was watching the exchanges at the right time last night.

I see Apple's market share taking a huge dip in the next few years.  As Android phones get better and IPhones don't make any huge advancements people will start to switch.  
Just over the past 2 years, 2 of my aunts, 2 of my uncles, 3 cousins, mom, girlfriend and I have all changed to Android.  I recognize the benefits of Android, but everyone else in that list changed simply to have something different.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:57:25
There should totally be a video serious set in the future talking about things that happened because of bitcoin (both good and bad).  
I'd watch that.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:05:23
This is part of it that I'm in the dark about.  Why is it so difficult for anyone to open an exchange in the US?  Even just places where you buy BTC... little to none of them take bank transfers.  
That's another issue keeping the average Joe from getting in.  The chore of having to go transfer money physically is enough to make some people laugh.

I can confirm that it's lower than. .10 BTC(like the post said and how it used to be). I just purchased .05 BTC to make one of my coins whole 5 minutes ago.

I honestly thought that it would take a few months to get to 1K, but with the rise in the past few days... and today alone, it could make it there much much sooner.
