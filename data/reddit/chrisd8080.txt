5 x roughly 11 is 55k...not 5-10 grand.  If it even tripled in 16 years which is really not a stretch it would pay for a good bulk of college...Not to mention as I mentioned I have other options like a 5029 and i would never cover her full tuition.  Stop reading into things to much.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:29:13
You cant expect to invest 2-3 k into something and for it to magically make you rich and retire etc.  
Stock market returns of 10% + per year are considered very good.  Bitcoin is a total wild card in 5-10 years it could be worth 50 bucks or it could be worth 500K.  Like just about everyone says, play with what you can afford to lose, because nothing is a sure bet.
To make real money though you will probably have to invest big money, if you want to get rich, that means getting a few bitcoins at least.  Takes money to make money.

I dunno i suppose, but you can't really measure crypto by wallstreet standards either..it's a different ballgame..
With that being said I have 3 different fidelity mutual funds which have done 16.5% 18% and 19% over the past 10 years on an annual basis.  Albeit it's been a hot market since 2009 of course.

nobody scamming here nerd, nobody is trying to sell you anything.
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:14:37
well I'm glad you do it all for the ideals, but not everyone approaches it like you do.  It's just simply another investment, albeit on the speculative side, to go along with stocks, real estate, 401k's...etc.  
I don't believe bitcoin is going to change the world and make things all better.  That's not why I got into it.  Maybe thats why you did, but not me.
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:47:25
I agree 100%.  It's total boom or bust.  Thats why i try to make it about 10% of the portfolio at max....You can't be all in on crypto, it's wrecked too many.  But if you're going to be in crypto bitcoin is by far the sure choice and one to bank on imo.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:11:26
1 million by 2024?  I dunno about that.  Im thinking maybe 100K by 2024
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:21:21
10% a year compounded over 16 years with 55k would actually pay for a decent portion of college and a car.  I never said her whole college.  Bitcoin is also not a "normal" investment and if you think it will be likely be a 7-10% type return investment, you are clearly dillusional.  It will either be a huge gainer or it will be a complete failure.. There will be no inbetween where bitcoin is just this ho hum 7-10 % type investment.  Get real....
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:10:25
Open up a coinbase account, then get on coinbase pro.  Trade there low fees ....you can buy a dollar if you want at a time, with little to no fees.  
Dollar cost average in a bit, dont just make one purchase.  Don't get all sad if it drops 10% the day after you buy in.  It's for the long haul, crazy fluctuations.  
Also the cliche, don't invest what you cant afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:33:32
Well i do own a home, that technically counts as a real estate investment. 
  
I'm not sure about rentals, they can be tricky, need the right tenants, the market can change greatly.  I am a real estate appraiser, I'm sort of sensing a bubble coming with respect to housing prices.  
It's hard to find those multi-unit rentals these days for a good price, seems like they all got snatched up after 08.  
But yeah if I could find the right property it would be a good way to diversify.

@_date: 2019-07-05 08:46:00
I agree, it will either be huge or who knows it will be a failure....that one guy seems to think 7-10%....who the heck measures bitcoin by the stock market, and the S &amp; P has even outdone 7-10 % past 10 years.  Look we all know here bitcoin is a boom or bust type of investment.  It will either be a home run or a complete disaster.  Lets be honest.  So far its been a home run.  Will that remain, nobody knows.  But I do know it wont be some ho hum investment.

Im not using it to get rich.....its one of many of my assets and just another ....i don't hold it like a lottery ticket or think it will make me own an island...like i said i hope in 16 years it helps me pay for my daughters college....thats really not that huge of a leap ...being that its already like worth 55k in present day dollars.  
I dunno where i said it would make me rich... I think you read into that.
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:25:20
I never once sdaid I need bitcoin to hit it big to get my kid through college....u clearly are reading into things.  It would sure be a nice bonus, but the college will be mainly funded via a 5029 of course.  Also, I would never fully fund my kids education, gotta make them work.  Nobody paid a dime of mine.
@_date: 2019-07-06 04:26:06
I have nothing to prove to you playboy
@_date: 2019-11-04 03:04:31
Always diversify, stocks/companies aren't going away.....it's important to have good long term stocks with dividends and reliable earnings. 
Have some bitcoin in your portfolio, have a little precious metals.  Buy some Core stocks of companies you know will be there in 10 years - google, visa, lockheed martin, disney, Waste Management, amazon....These type of companies are going nowhere, and there are many more.  
I have a lot of bitcoin and invest daily in bitcoin, but don't forget to branch out and invest in good companis, with earnings and a history of success.  
Get some bitcoin, precious metals, quality core stocks and some land/real estate, and you'll end up just fine.

yes I invest in "sound money" every day of the week 365 days a year...that doesnt mean companies like walmart, amazon, google are going to be going away and everything will be just bitcoin.  Come down from your high, and get in the real world.

It is hard does take work, but ive done better picking 5-10 stocks then my index S &amp; P funds I have.

@_date: 2019-11-04 04:06:23
okay.  When the stock market ceases to exist, and bitcoin and crypto is all that exists.  I will concede you are correct.  Until then, it's straight up speculation, something you truly believe will happen, but that doesn't make it a certainty...Neither one of us will live long enough to see this potential scenario anyways.
@_date: 2019-11-04 03:42:43
ok you are right, bitcoin is all we need, we don't need companies, stocks, earnings and dividends.  
All we need is satoshis.  
Got it, noted.  I appreciate the advice.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:36:02
Thats a good plan diversify a bit.  Fill up that ROTH IRA, work hard, life gets boring without work to be honest, you don't have to work 60 hrs per week, but nothing wrong with working 40's.  It's good for a person.  I hope your targets are right on bitcoin, I have significant bitcoin holdings, so if those numbers are reached, I definitely can have that lake cabin home!
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:22:08
but what if Bitcoin never approaches 100k, and never amounts to nothing more than it is right now, than the debt won't be paid off and the retirement wont be set.  Anything can happen.  I invest a lot in bitcoin, but there is definitely no certainty with bitcoin, that it even goes to 100K.
@_date: 2019-10-31 05:16:53
it is immediate.  You don't have to transfer it per say to coinbase pro.  It should already be there, coinbase and coinbase pro are the same entity.  You just go to coinbase pro and click depot-us dollar- coinbase account and then purchase your crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-10 08:53:08
Use coinbasepro very low fees.  Regular coinbase has huge fees.  Yes coinbase is secure but prob get off exchange if u get a lot.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:50:11
if you plan on ever getting well off on bitcoin you better have at least 5-10 minimum.
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:35:15
I do it every day, im not sure.  SOmeone else also did it earlier that was in this subreddit, that didn't know about it.  I'm not sure why it doesn't work for you.
@_date: 2019-10-30 07:13:12
just find what works best for you based on your goals and how long you plan on holding etc.  A lot is factored into a decision.
As for me I am a long term hodlr, and plan on holding 5-10+ years in the future.  I buy 1/200 of a bitcoin every day, 7 days per week, which is 500,000 satoshis every day.  I try to buy the daily dip.  Sometimes when bitcoin has 5% drops or massive drops, ill buy more.
@_date: 2019-10-30 07:22:46
I make all my purchases on coinbasepro. 
I can instantly buy on coinbase and transfer it immediately to my coinbasepro account.  All in all it takes a minute or two and saves me on fees from regular coinbase.
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:51:30
why not give yourself knowledge, read a book on bitcoin, or watch videos on youtube, or documentaries.  Always do your own extensive research before any investment.
@_date: 2019-10-08 07:33:30
bitcoin is not a get rich investment...everyone should know this by now....
Dollar cost average and you should be okay, ive bought all sorts of different price points and have done well, and bought as high as 13k and as low as $1,800. Never go all in and use money that you don't need for your kids presents.
@_date: 2019-10-08 09:00:42
Cuz parabolic rises like we had in late 2017 are never sustainable.  Hence it crashed.  Bitcoin probably will do great long term but its had multiple 70 to 90% retracements after big run ups.  Trust me I think big with btc.  I purchase 500 K Satoshi everyday 7 days a week.  However I think its fairly priced currently in due time after more adoption..better regulations and halvening the fair price could be much higher.  We are still so early.
@_date: 2019-08-26 02:11:24
State fair is a big deal in Minnesota, one of biggest in country, they have a bunch of weird new foods every year, and fried everything.

Is the price really low?? 8200.  Remember was only what 2.5 yrs ago btc was like 600.  Sure we had a quick parabolic spike which was irrational and not sustainable to 19 K.  I don't think 8200 is low priced though.  Depends on if your comparing it to its parabolic rise that didn't last long.  That's not a great metric.

you depoit money into coinbase regular - USD.  Then you open up your coinbasepro click on deposit funds, then coinbase funds.  Then you buy your crypto. The whole process of adding money to coinbase then being able to trade with it on coinbasepro takes me less than a minute.  You should be good if you have your bank accounts linked up and stuff.

yeah i agree with you.  I have 95 of my btc in cold storage.  However Im trying to max out my IRA for my wife and I this year, and im sick of buying the standard (Google, apple, lockheed martin, walmart) style stocks.  So I thought id spice it up a little bit with some grayscale.  Maybe over time try to get 1,000 shares of it, if possible.

Do any of you guys buy Grayscale Bitcoin - GBTC for your IRA's.  Was just curious.  I know you pay a premium but it seems to also hold its premium pretty well.  Sorta nice you can trade in and out and not have to worry about tax implications.
@_date: 2019-09-17 22:23:59
Buy some bitcoin when u can, max out your Roth IRA, maybe your company matches, you are young, invest in your companies best funds/growth..more upside type funds.  Over the course of time, you should be fine, bitcoin, stock market, your property/land you aquire over time will likely go up.   The best thing you can do is invest in yourself, always try to climb the ladder, unless it's killing you of course, with stress and time.  Keep looking to get more skills and go up.  Set a budget, be consistent and you'll be just fine.  People find a way to do it one way or another. We also all don't need to have millions of dollars to retire like they make you think.
