I made a paper wallet and have the watch only address on Mycelium and Blockchain.info to watch it. I figure it will be easy to add more to it, but also be a deterrent from immediate spending.

I'll go ahead and check it out
First thoughts: I like that it auto generates an address, but would like to create other addresses, including BIP38 addresses which I have never seen an app allow you to do. I like the ability to choose denomination and also precision. This is the only app I've seen to allow precision. I also like how clean it looks, but would also like a dark theme. I like the ability to type either in BTC or USD but I think the exchange rate is a bit off and would like to be able to choose between different exchanges. Right now the price should be around $596 but it shows 1 BTC as $613.14 which I could see causing some problems. The appstore looks like it has potential, but there aren't any apps I currently would want to use. Lastly, the find other Hive users option is interesting, but I would like to be able to change the ability to see my picture or use my real name.
My address for the app is 1M8YZTMfXFjLHZtL3WnY7HJguQRB2LHDqk
Extra thoughts: I would like it to tell you when a transaction is confirmed, similar to how Mycelium works, and it would be nice to choose what you would like to use as a miner's fee. As of now it might confuse some people why less was sent than they tried to because of the automatic fee that is attached without warning.

I tend to see .0001 as the current go to miner fee right now

She won't show you her privates though.

Thank you! Now I need to do some research on how to properly use ChangeTip.

Here's a bug: if you are make a bet, lose, then don't have more coins chips left than what your current bet chip is, you can't change the chip. E.g. you have 11 chips, bet with ten, lose, and then can't change to bet that last one.

For me, it has been two days after the purchase. So I would assume Thursday would be when it will be deducted.

Also, if you like The Arctic Monkeys, you should check out the soundtrack to Submarine which is by Alex Turner, the lead singer of The Arctic Monkeys.

A bitcoin Address has a public key and a private key. The public key is the one that is shared to people so that they can send the address coins. The private key is what the owner of the bitcoin uses to spend them. In Mycelium, the key symbol means that they address has both the public and private key associated with it on the app. You will need to add the private keys to the other addresses before you can spend from them. To do so, find where you have the private key for those addresses, and scan the QR code for them in Mycelium. The address already in there will then be able to spend the coins.

I bought an ethernet cable from them today with bitcoin. It was super easy, and I liked being able to make a purchase without needing an account.

I don't understand what you mean. His situation is the same as mine. Neither of us had money disappear. For both of us the transaction showed up, then went away and the account was recredited with the amount. Then later the transaction worked.

I would love for the ability to generate a BIP38 address. I've seen apps which let you generate non-BIP38 addresses, or let you import ones that you have created, but I would really like to be able to make a nice passphrase protected wallet on the fly, instead of having to generate one from my computer. 
Edit: Also, for BIP38, I'd like the ability to retype the passphrase to check that it is the same before creating the address, as one often does when they set up passwords. I sometimes get paranoid that I mistyped it, and will not be able to access funds sent to that address.

I have electronic backups that are BIP38 secured.

I just transferred my BTC to cold storage and thought the same thing. Sure $0.07 isn't huge, but I'm just moving money from one address to another I own.

[This]( is the set of instructions I used. I found it fairly easy, but I will admit, I can't see my parents finding it so simple. If I did have one concern with bitcoin going mainstream, it's that having good security can seem pretty intimidating for those who aren't techy.

The same thing happened to me a few days ago. Same response that they weren't why it happened. It just seemed to start working after about 2 or so hours.

I'm with the attitude of waiting to see. Once they come out, I'll feel better making any judgement for or against them.

I just bought my first bitcoin a week ago. Good timing and having fun watching all this.
