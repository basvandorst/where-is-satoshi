What kind of brace do you have?  I went to the ER because the pain was too much :(
I’m currently writing this while getting a cat scan.  The good news is that my ACL looks fine - it’s the meniscus that is likely torn and the X-ray showed that I at least have a fracture or chip on the outer tibia, and the doc mentioned that on the inside of the knee my ligament literally pulled a chip of bone right off.  Awaiting cat scan results.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:45:11
I absolutely will.  I've already pushed back my start date a few days because I can barely move.  I had to crawl from the car to my house on my hands and butt, lol.  
Seriously, we need universal single payer healthcare... the fact I delayed this because I thought I wouldn't be covered is so ridiculous.  I appreciate you telling me what Kaiser failed to, though.
I was actually very worried this would be something I wouldn't fully recover from because I wouldn't be able to get surgery I'm pretty sure I need.  THANK YOU.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:21:15
I might -  but I definitely need it evaluated, the whole leg is swollen and I cannot move without pain.  Another poster said cobra will be retroactive, so I’m banking on that.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:16:26
I know many Canadians and they ALL are more satisfied with their healthcare than ours.
We agree to disagree.  Statistics always show that people in Britain and Canada have better healthcare than the US for developed nations.  I’m sorry about your uncle, but this country NEEDS single payer.  If you want private insurance you are still welcome to buy it and go to private hospitals, like Kaiser, but you know what’s better than no coverage?  
Universal goddamn healthcare. Period.  There is no argument to be made that something is better than nothing.  It’s just a fact.
Also, I would much rather have Bernie in office than the current administration, lmao.

I don't think it's struggling.  I think this is pretty typical of every January, to be honest.  We needed a correction and got one.  
More people are going to get into this.. it's only going to grow in popularity.  
To be fair, I own less in Bitcoin than I do Ethereum right now.  I even have some BCH while I wait for the next Roger Ver pump and dump to ditch it...
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:43:03
Don't know, I've been home ever since it happened yesterday.. my girlfriend picked up crutches and a knee immobilizer from Craigslist.  Tried looking into Cobra but they told me it wouldn't start until Feb. 1st anyway, and my new insurance will be started by then.
I called a Doctor friend for advice and she said it would probably be 2-3 thousand for an ER trip plus MRI/X-ray (uninsured - total, I would hope.. I think ER is ~1200 on its own, but I've always had insurance).  I read the average for ACL surgery once I'm covered again is ~2300 out of pocket.  It sucks.  I was stupid and shouldn't have done something like dirtbiking when my insurance was expiring.  I haven't had a period I wasn't covered in 10 years or so and didn't even think of the fact that my new insurance wouldn't start until February; I left my old job on the 22nd to start the new one on the 2nd.   
I'm just happy that my investment back in March/April will keep me from having serious financial difficulties.  It is lifechanging to me in that it may keep me from having a permanent disability/change in my life.

@_date: 2018-01-15 19:54:12
This guy gets it.
In the beginning I would make a trade or two in the morning, then get FOMO and jump back in and get burned and go from green to red.
Eventually, I learned to stop doing that and limit myself to 2-3 trades a day if I decided to trade at all.  Doing that stopped me from making dumb decisions based on a quick change in the trend because I'd say, "Hey, this is your one shot. If it goes higher/lower later, you already made your trade..."  My gains were typically in smaller amounts, but I went from losing overall to gaining quite a bit.  
Also, the ability to withstand big drops and just go, "Well, guess I'm holding on for a while," helped a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:22:41
Ha, I didn’t before, but I bet I will now.  
Previously, I have hurt my mcl a couple of times in basketball and water sports.. nothing requiring surgery, but the last one took about 6 months to heal.  This is a different beast altogether, I can tell.
This is the leg I didn’t hurt my mcl on, by the way.  Guess it was making up for lost time.
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:47:36
I suppose time will tell.  Seems like a pretty typical January slump to me, so far.  I convinced a fair number of family/friends to get in and only one has sold.  I specifically told them this wasn't a short term investment.  
Maybe some will sell, but I think a lot of people will start figuring out that it's just stupid to sell at a loss with something that will, in all likelihood, increase or at a bare minimum return to whatever they bought in at.  (At some point.)
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:49:54
It is - and I made a couple trades that netted me an extra 530 worth of it.  I try not to due to the risk, but I figured if I was going to have to actually take some out, I might as well risk it and it worked out well. 
I'm just happy it's not the ACL.  That would have meant permanent damage.  A broken bone should eventually be good as new.  (I was lucky and the bone didn't move, just has cracks all up and down it in a few places, so there was no setting needed and it shouldn't need pins or anything.
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:35:40

@_date: 2018-01-02 08:16:59
Wtf.. i called Kaiser yesterday about this and they told me it wouldn't start until the 1st of February.

Always nice to see an article saying it will hit 100k the same day as an article where another guy says it's gonna go to 1k.  
.... maybe.. maybe no one knows?  
(That said, I think 25-30k could be pretty possible in a couple months.  Can't wait for this typical January slump to wear off like it does every year.)

I'm new to capital gains taxes and such, so I figured others in here might be, as well.

Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:47:45
It's a lot easier to appreciate with the recent examples of the lightning network we've been shown.
Before that, I was on the fence on holding and thinking it was more of a "cash out at the right time" situation or even a digital gold alternative for storing wealth.  Soon, it will actually be usable as currency and people will be able to abandon fiat with much less hassle than before.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:30:00
I bought like 2300 in LTC months ago at 53.. day traded it up and down and was up 4-500, then bought back in at 97... when it immediately crashed to like 47.  
Stayed there 3 months.  See where it is, now?  
Stay strong, it'll be worth it - even if it takes a year.  
That said, I expect a big boom around Christmas just like Thanksgiving.  This infighting bullshit that came out will go away, more futures and exchanges are offering BTC contracts and the like, and word of mouth + Christmas cash will go nuts.

Idk if you can even call it a correction, yet.  I mean, it's still hovering around 4025 or so on average... if that's it, it's a pretty awesome correction.  
I expect a "real" correction to 28-2900.  The real question is:  when my price alert goes off at 3850, do I decide to sell some and buy again a few hundred cheaper?  Even if I lost, I'd still be so far up that it wouldn't be a big deal, since I'm in it for the long run.. but more overall coin is more coin...
I'll probably puss out and just hodl, lol.

What resource would you recommend for learning more about the day trading side of BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:24:48
This is one of the problems, though.. I think LTC will be much better for this kind of thing...
Now, if the meme showed a house and said, "You can buy this house for 1.5 BTC" it would be a little better.
No one wants to try and look at an 8 digit decimal to figure out what their bill is, y'know?
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:08:01

And that's fine for us.. the people smart enough to have already adopted or at least recognize the value of BTC, but for the highschool dropout that can barely make proper change for a dollar?  Idk... it's got to be easy enough for everyone to use it without thinking twice. 
I still think it will happen, but I do worry about that.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:16:29
Wait, GDAX = Coinbase?  
When you say they don't charge for makers, only takers.. what do you mean by that?  I can trade between currencies with no fees up until the point I withdraw?  
Is there any reason I shouldn't be using GDAX instead of Coinbase??
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:51:17
So, to clarify - the main difference, aside from the lack of fees on (some) trading, is that Coinbase locks in the price at the moment you decide to buy/sell, whereas GDAX prices can vary due to when your transaction actually "posts," which, as we know can be fairly substantial in BTC-land.  Correct?
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:07:39
Yeah, I get that, but what is the limit, then?  Is the limit like saying "Fill the sell order, but if you don't do it before it drops to this number, don't sell at all?"  (And therefore in a Stop sell, the limit should always be lower than the stop price.)

@_date: 2017-11-16 17:50:02
The problem here is the fundamental understanding of Bitcoin owners that the writer lacks... we don't want this to be merely an investment.  We aren't selling.  THIS is OUR currency.  When it's worth 196,000, we won't have to sell.  We will simply pay our bills and continue on as folks do with their fiat bank accounts. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:58
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time.  I could buy right now and I'd have quite a bit more then when I cashed out at 7100.
I've been pretty good at it, so far :)
PS - It doesn't have to be the bottom.. it just has to be lower than when i sold.  Let's say it goes to 6k and I buy back in and wait 2 years... I waited half a year this time around... it's not exactly daytrading - not like I"m doing it everyday, just during the major drops.
I'm just not a fan of the blatant manipulation I see going on at the moment.

I'm in the bay area, which is top-tier motorcycle pricing.  I also own a Honda XR650L, ZX-14, and my girlfriend owns a Z1000.
3k for a 2005 KLR650 is wayyyy too high.  XR650L's and other true dual sports sell for more than the KLR's, and I didn't even pay 3k for mine in perfect condition - and it's about the same age.
KLR's are nice bikes, but not expensive bikes.

To me, it all depends on your tech level of expertise/home network security.  Personally, I had an old Ironkey drive that i use as an external wallet.  That thing is secure to the point of physical destruction if you try to force it open, as well as encrypted.
Everyone here loves Trezor, if I'm not mistaken.  However, if you've only got a tiny bit of bitcoin, I doubt anyone will really be coming after your address... what I did was backup my wallet on two separate usb drives, write down all my passwords and private keys, then put them in one of those realtor lockboxes that you can put around a doorknob and requires a combination.  Then I hid that.  
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:54:31
Yup.. I sold before the dip... jumped back in yesterday.  Should have jumped at the 5000-levels we saw, but was hesitant. 
Either way, I now have more BTC than ever before :)  
Now if only I bought some BCH, too, so I could have dumped it when it hit 2k+ and put THAT into BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:14
Ahem.... just happened.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:38:16
Pretty sure he was just being realistic, judging from the current trend and all this BS about BCH becoming BTC.  He was smart.

I'm probably gonna get roasted for this, but man - if you're living paycheck to paycheck and have that much BTC, I say cash out on some BCH, then maybe some BTC, and pull out 500k - then buy that friggin' house.  
Personally, I also say cash out another 100-200k and put it into a REAL 401k.  You owe it to you and your wife to do something that will set you up for life later on, even if BTC somehow dies or gets regulated to death.
Finally, I'd take 5k out and go on a nice vacation.  Then leave the remaining amount in Bitcoin.  Also, I would only tell her about 100 btc, because I'm a shady fuck, lol.. move the other 100 into a separate wallet and keep quiet until you need it.
That's my advice.  Stop renting and throwing that money away, get a traditional investment/savings for the future, then continue on.  Even on 30k, if you've got the house paid for you should be set.

Sorry you're getting such dickish responses on here.  People shouldn't be calling you stupid or ripping into you for this.  It looks like you honestly wanted them back.. gave up.. and came back one more time now that they are valuable in the hopes maybe someone else had heard of this company and could help.  Seems fair, to me.  I would probably pursue something a lot more if it had gone up 500x in value, too!
If people don't have anything nice to say or aren't willing to help, I really don't understand why they respond in the first place.

Yeah, that's what i saw it as, as well.  I moved from Chicago for the same reasons - taxes are absolutely asinine.  The point of the city government isn't to make money, but they don't see it that way.

I'd ask them if their investments were still up 3x from when they bought in last year... and if they said they were, I'd ask them kindly what stocks they purchased and buy them or call them liars.
My co-worker bought 5-600 dollars worth of ethereum when it was 7 bucks each... no one has talked shit about the dip to him... :p

Um, no?  It's a credit card.  Cash is cash.  Try using your visa pre-paid at a cash-only bar/restaurant/establishment.  
Also, if Visa is disallowing purchases of Bitcoin through their system, then the card simply won't work.
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:54:37
And that's why I just put another 130 into btc to buy a bit of this dip!  Every little bit counts.  Every paycheck I'm buying a couple hundred of it.

The laundering charge comes from the fact that he knowingly accepted monies involved in the creation of a substance legal in our state, but illegal on a Federal level.  
Sorry, but that's just trumped up bullshit.  Also, the fed should gtfo of our state in that regard.  We voted - we don't mind pot, so stop trying to arrest our citizens and waste our tax dollars to throw them in prison for something we don't even view as wrong.

The question is: Why the fuck are there a limited number of licenses.  Pay the fee, get a license.  THAT is how it should be.  That is capitalism, right?  To ensure competition that drives the market?  Instead, we're left with the 5-6 cart-owners who are loaded enough to afford an insane license that costs more than most houses in the US?  It's infuriating.

Chase gave me a 5 dollar "non-atm cash withdrawal" on my last coinbase purchase made on my debit card with my money... (not credit in any way.)
Needless to say, I called them up and told them to reverse it.  They said, "We have changed our policy on.." and I just said, "Stop right there - you may have changed something, but since I didn't get a letter or email about it you can go ahead and reverse the charge while I prepare to close all my accounts with your company.  Feel free to note the reason I'm doing this is because I plan on using my money in any way I see fit, even if the bank fears and wants to discourage what I choose to do with that money."
He reversed the charge and I will no longer be using Chase.

Calling him a "wetback" is not strengthening your opinions to many people..
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:51:04
The problem with this is that when it hits 15k you won't want to sell.  In fact, you'll say, "Wait, why should I sell here when it's going to hit 20k soon?"
It's a good "problem" to have, though..
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:42:51
Uh, where are you getting that number?
It says 75 or 200 dollars, depending on type.

It's just annoying because I've listened to his bs for years as an old co-worker.  
No one could stand him due to the fact he thought he knew everything... and was pretty bad at his job... then Google hired him as a resident.  Granted, it was bitch work, but it led to more - it was surprising just because we all knew how bad he was and were shocked someone at Google would have given him a chance.

I don't know the exchange.. but could you move bitcoin in, sell it, buy another coin that isn't as inflated (litecoin?) move it back, sell for cash, buy more bitcoin?
Edit - I went to what I assume is the correct exchange and only saw bitcoin.. so I guess not.  Also says their 30 day volume is only 78 bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:06:22
Yeah, I talk about selling, but if it went to 3-400 in a year or two I'd look pretty dumb. 
Best bet is I'll probably just start funneling another 50 bucks a paycheck into LTC and BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:03:08
I can't wait.. just so I can throw it in the jackass' face who keeps going back and forth with me on my facebook about how it isn't a real currency.

Right?  I waited and have held onto my BCH, but plan on dumping soon... wish i would have done it when it hit 1k.

I was thinking more of changing to a less inflated coin and sending that back for the same reason, but I guess they only deal in BTC.

Is murder legal in your state statutes?? 
If not, your comment has little relevance.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:59:46
Exactly.  I bought at 2300 this year... Everyone at work kept subtly poking fun at me as I day-traded in BTC and LTC (and a little Ethereum), even though I was pocketing an extra 30-100 a day for a while.
Now it's ~6k and they ask "Wait, so how much is your Bitcoin worth, now??"
Don't be jelly, co-workers.
Now, if LTC would rise to 75+ I'd REALLY be happy.  (Just because I want to liquidate it and put it in BTC and that's my price point.)

I had a couple prepaid gift cards a few years back and decided I would rather have cash, so I paid myself via PayPal using the cards as if I were selling goods.  Paid like 2% in fees, but then the cash was mine to use as I wanted..

He just doesn't believe it's anything but a commodity.. then he makes claims, "You don't see people using it to buy soda at the gas station."
I told him, "no, YOU don't see that, because you aren't looking.  Many of us have multiple wallets - one for saving and one for actually spending."
It's frustrating.
In one breath he says it has no value and is not a currency and in the next he claims the government will regulate it and its value will plummet.  I tried explaining that if the government regulates it, it means they've accepted it has value, which stabilizes it and will mean that it is now a currency of which only 21 million will ever exist, making its value rise.  You can't have it both ways, y'know?  If it's not a currency, why would any government regulate it (or try)?

After I watched Ajit Pai go against 75-85% (depending on the poll) of the US genpop's wishes with his war on net neutrality, I decided Heads-On-Sticks really do make good statements to those that feel they are impervious to accountability and perhaps need to make a comeback.
In other words - Yup, I agree.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:58:29
Right?  Like, what is his point?  It's quite clear the vast majority of people supported net neutrality - it's not even a question.  Arguing semantics, I suppose..
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:57:02
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The point was that it's long been clear the VAST majority of people support net neutrality.  
That's not up for debate and I'm not starting one with you over polls.  It's common knowledge at this point.  When net neutrality is explained for people who might not know what it is, the numbers only increase further.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:59:32
Yeah, y'know, or Ben Franklin.
“We need a revolution every 200 years, because all governments become stale and corrupt after 200 years.” 
The fact is - that guy (Pai) not only went against the public interest - when the people had clearly made their intent known, but did so in an awful and condescending way, laughing at the people accusing him of doing EXACTLY what he was doing (being a shill for his industry) and going so far as to make fun of the entire thing in internet videos.  He knows that he is "invincible."  I mean, the evidence has clearly shown the FCC did illegal things regarding the comment manipulation and still we, the public, seem to have ZERO recourse.  I'm all for changing things the legal way - but that's clearly no longer always an option.  
So, you tell me - what options do we have to stop people who are impervious to the rule of law the rest of us are subjected to?

Do what I did... I took a couple grand and said, "This may or may not look great in the short run, but just put the coins in an offline wallet and forget about them for 1-2 years."  I've since started buying 1-200 a week when I can, unless there is a sudden rise.  I used to take that money and buy electronics and fun stuff, but I don't even think about it now.. and I think in the long run I'm gonna be pretty damned happy about that decision.
Now, my only issue is that I also bought 3.5 ether coins and I'm not happy about their performance, lol.  It's never bad to diversify, though, right?
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:46:40
Yeah, I appreciate knowing that CoinBase is bad and i don't plan on continuing to use it, but it's kind of like this conversation: 
"How do I deal with this speeding ticket?  I've never gotten one." 
"Why were you speeding?  Didn't you know the speed limit?  It was posted.  You just have to pay the consequences."
It isn't advice at all, lol.

How long does the transaction usually stay in "pending?" 
I wanted them out before Aug 1st, so I'm sure I have enough time, but still annoying.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:49:41
Same.  I purchased another .6 at 2600 and I'm happy I did.. was I annoyed when it dipped?  Sure, but I expect it to go much higher...
...besides, it's going to be 500k in 3 years or I get to watch an eccentric pseudo-celebrity eat his cack on national television.  Win-Win.

I bought them there last week - no need to be a jerk.  It's not like I was sitting here using the wallet as long term storage.. Coinbase was the simplest way I found to buy them.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:49:03
Yeah, that's what i did, too.. apparently I deserve to lose my bitcoins for having purchased them there?
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:31:16
Because almost no one supports it.  Low fees or not, you gotta have support from the community to make it work.
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:30:32
Lol, you don't actually call what you said a warning, do you?  Don't be delusional.
Let's look at what actually happened.  I came to asking for help getting my coins off CB.  Your response was to ask why I "put" them there (I didn't "put" them there.. I purchased them.).  You talk about warnings; this is my first time posting in You weren't trying to warn me.  You were chastising me for "putting" coins there that i was trying to remove.  No "friend" recommended it.  I did research and it seemed that was the easiest way to buy them.  A warning would have been, "You should try to avoid CB in the future - it's no good."  Of course, I am already going to do that, what with the possible split coming and their potential actions.
Get real, man.
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:37:30
Smart explanation.  Thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:17:33
Yup, I got the email telling me I made the transaction at about 35 minutes... still pending.  I'm not too worried - I'm not really in any rush, as long as it happens before the 27th or so.  It's not like I'm cashing out...
