He's referring to the word "scheme" having a negative connotation in American English (along the lines of "plotting and scheming") while being neutral in British English.
To illustrate this just make a Google search for "retirement scheme" and notice how all results are from places like Hongkong, New Zealand, India, Malaysia, ... where British English is spoken.        
(If you want the UK results just search for "pension scheme" instead.)
To an American on the other hand a "retirement/pension scheme" would sound rather strange, as in AE "scheme" has acquired the connotation of being something shady &amp; underhanded.          
Search for "retirement plan" and your results will be dominated by American websites.
The English taught in Europe is generally British English.

For a currency exchange or most of the other services proposed in this thread the web development part is a relatively insignificant aspect of the total problem. 
Please consider honestly if you would be qualified to run a startup in the financial services industry. Writing code is the one part of your business you could probably outsource the most easily - writing a solid business plan, raising capital, surviving in the regulatory environment(s), ... are the areas in which your entrepreneurial skills are required and on which you'll realistically spend most of your time.

That's ignoring that the velocity of money can change. E.g. the monetary supply of the USD was inflated massively by the Fed since the financial crisis but as the velocity of money dropped like a rock price inflation remained low.
Of course now the increased money supply is like a huge lever which could cause small changes in the velocity of money to have big effects on prices but if you believe that the central bank has the right tools to recognize such changes early and can contract the money supply rapidly if necessary then there's nothing wrong with such behavior.
The fixation on monetary inflation as opposed to price inflation in this community seems strange to me. I suspect that it is to a large part caused by the lack of price inflation after the expansion of the US money supply.         
As the hyperinflation (of prices) that gold bugs and doomsday prophets predicted just didn't happen they eventually decided that price inflation never mattered anyways.

What's the issue with coinbase sending the money from your bank account to Time without converting it to bitcoin first? Not like they'd have to pay Western Union-style transfer fees.
I see how your suggestion is convenient to the user but I don't see why it would require the use of bitcoin.

Whether you are prosecution or defense, you want somebody who is malleable. And judging by the transcripts having a computer-literate jury would do Dratel no favors as they would only recognize his incompetence in technical matters all the more clearly.

Communist UK should have some love for Rosa Luxemburg ;)
(As an aside: In Germany all major parties are associated with foundations that act as their think tanks, research/preserve the party history, support undergraduate and graduate students close to the party with scholarships and workshops, represent the party's ideology internationally, ...              
The Rosa Luxemburg Foundation belongs to the socialist party [Die Linke](

It's the opposite of sensible accounting standards.
I don't know about the US but where I live the general rule of thumb (there are exceptions for some investment vehicles) is that losses have to be reflected as soon as they occur, whereas gains may only be reflected once they are realized. 
So if an asset is bought at $100,000 and dips in market value to $80,000 you have to correct it to $80,000 in your accounting. If the market price later recovers to $100,000 you must keep the asset at $80,000 in your balance sheet until you have realized the gain.
This is sensible as a key purpose of external accounting is to protect creditors. It wants to prevent you from claiming profits that only exist on paper, funnel these "profits" into the pockets of your shareholders/yourself, and then leave your creditors hanging once the market has corrected. Your creditors don't care whether your company is actually worth more than is reflected in the balance sheet, but they need to know how much your assets are at least worth.
A great example for this is the German Bundesbank which was a constant target for the desires of greedy politicians during the recent gold bubble. Most of the bank's gold reserves were bought in times of much lower prices and are still valued at these purchase prices. Politicians pushed for the Bundesbank to be forced to adopt mark-to-market valuation as this would generate massive book profits which then would have to be distributed to the government budget. In hindsight this would have been pretty stupid (requiring the bank to be recapitalized when prices dropped).

Had a summer job at an insurance company a few years ago and they had some employees who did just that. The office building had a small gym in the basement (company offered free yoga classes etc. to its employees), so they'd ride the bike to work, take a shower (on company time), dress into business attire and then go upstairs to their respective offices.

This is not about you using your money, it is about you asking the bank to act as an intermediary for you.         
Why would you think that you can force another business to act on your behalf in transactions it doesn't want to be involved in?
You do have a right to withdraw your money and send it wherever you want to, you do not have a right to the convenience of wire-transfers.

Currently the show gets to keep the revenue from all the calls (local version of "American Idol" charges 0.50€ for every vote), why would they suddenly start giving it to the contestants?
