I give away dozens of short stories on my site and have only ever gotten 1 donation for any of it via the ChangeTip service. Have QRs for BTC, Doge, DRK, MMC for a while, etc. 
I appreciate the hell out of that donation though.
It acknowledge it's partly my fault because it's not a site I advertise and even the donation page is a link at the bottom of the page that can be hidden. But even before this iteration of my site, it was not something taken up by people.

If the user doesn't have it it currently just doesn't verify or anything. 
Learned that when I got a fake and tried to tip it on....

Ditto.

Totally agree. The "bitcoin or die" mentality is something I don't understand. It's not a 0 sum game.

I think you mean "Grammar Nazis." "'s" means possessive or a contraction.

We at welcome you! 
Or not.

Cool. I have like 50 cents in BTC so any bit to get me started diversifying (started with DOGE, to be honest) is good. 
Thanks, even if you don't get to me. This is cool.

I am a generous person.

Can I ask why it has to be one or the other? In other words, isn't the argument about freeing currency also applicable here so one can use other currencies?

Thank you!
