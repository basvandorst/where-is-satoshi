I've never seen it promoted as real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:06:41
You haven't read my comments at all have you? Whatever, at this point I'm just assuming you are a moron so Im not gonna bother with this dumb repetitive bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:39:14
I read it a few times and it looks like you summed up my comment in a single quote, maybe you should read it a few times

Did some light googling, found their website. They talk about the differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, how it is a fork of Bitcoin ext. I think a lot of the people on this sub just don't understand what a fork is

Yeah I saw all that and again he's saying that bcash is going to be bigger then bitcoin, he's not saying it's literately Bitcoin. He constantly compares the two, and he complains about the fees of Bitcoin saying it's "abandoned its original values" which is why he is now claiming that bcash is the new Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is no longer the real Bitcoin. He's trying to promote his currency over bitcoin, he's not trying to scam everyone into thinking it's the original.

Please go into more detail, I've asked like 20 people how it is a"scam" and have gotten little response other than "he's a con artist"or "he's a dick"
@_date: 2018-01-15 00:56:50
I'm pretty sure he's trying to say that Bitcoin Cash will become bigger then bitcoin (and yes I already saw this)

Nice summarization that ignores all my actual points
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:04:52
That's exactly what I was thinking while reading your comments!

Right? I never understand why people talk about hodling so much, that would remind me that I have a bunch of free money that I actually have access to and would make hodling it more difficult

Glad to see someone understands how to Bitcoin

If Trump doesn't like Bitcoin Cash then I think I'm gonna buy some Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:02:55
Seriously, can someone explain the problem with Bitcoin Cash?(other then the fact that it's not Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:59:40
I'll sell him a Bitcoin for the low price of 18k
@_date: 2017-03-22 19:16:15
 Thank you for your useless information. 
P.s. not a mining pc, it's a gaming pc. Just figured id use it to build a little bit while saving for a real mining rig
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:45:19
 Thanks, this is the type of answer i was looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:33
Yeah Bitcoin Cash was terrible, I mean the price of Bitcoin like barely skyrocketed after that.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:24:45
Fucking why?

What my friend think I do: nothing
What my mom thinks I do: magic
What I actually do: nothing

Probably still works better than the Jaxx wallet
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:35:15
Interesting, I'll take a look at the full site. I haven't don't that in awhile.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:21:33
Oh their policies pissed me off too
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:28:13
Indeed, I worked at an auto parts​ store and costumers would regularly come in complaining that the part their mechanic told them to get didn't fix their problem and (of course) act like it's my fault they were told to buy the wrong shit. This would usually lead to a long conversation about how the OBD system works in a car, which would (sometimes) make people realise that hiring a "mobile mechanic" was terrible idea because most of them literally guess what part is fucked, and then keep replacing shit until eventually shit works properly.

That's fucking genius (the price is likely to drop again but should be worth a lot in 5-10 years)
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:11:05
Is this something I can do in the app?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:54:41
This is a fairly useless edition unless you are for some reason using bitcoin, ether, or litecoin to buy stuff(rather then saving it like most people), a really good feature would be having the money in your account as soon as you SELL your shit.

Why do you think there CEO of Chase keeps calling it a scam?
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:08:11
Honestly it's pretty smart, although considering the price of the operation I think I'll stick to my custom rigs. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:32:18
That's not exactly what's happening
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:39:35
So basicly you are making more money so they want more money. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:41:30
Wow fuck that guy
