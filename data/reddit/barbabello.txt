@_date: 2016-04-20 03:10:56
can I invest in your company??
@_date: 2016-04-14 17:56:46
Classic .15 but i see have .19 , i try to instal a new one, but dont have idea how to verify the signature and gdg etc , its to complicated for a noob like me :( so i just download it, you think its safe? (from teh multibit website)
@_date: 2016-04-23 01:18:37
haha Tony G, Rofl
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:51:14
Ok just did to the latest on a new computer and i imported the wallet there. However I dont see a fee slider you were talking about in another archived thread.  Now its stuck on 3 peers.
@_date: 2016-04-15 00:39:37
I did to the newest version, however I dont see the feeslider (they said it was added in the last version of multibit classic. It took about 40 minutes to send. An improvement but if I could fine the slider to put a higher fee it would be great.
@_date: 2016-04-02 02:12:55
How are they gonna profit from that? 
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:18:32
if that happens the crash close to zero wiping out billions with it, would have done to much damage to the image of bitcoin. The everage Joe would never ever come back.

Well I am a noob, I like to think it works like that, I get more adrenaline holding Coins if it can be hacked. lol
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:28:42
I dont have idea of 'how' it can be hacked. I dont care about 'how' but on 'if'.
@_date: 2016-03-30 17:15:25
It is not meant as an investment, but it is an investment for some people.....
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:15:57
it already happened? link?
@_date: 2016-03-27 04:09:45
Thanks, I think I start to get a better understanding of all this.
@_date: 2016-03-29 15:50:32
It spiked because everybody is searching about how bitcoin is failing.
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:26:12
Depends what country you live in. My wire SEPA takes 1 working day. So its not fast. You have site where you can by with your bankcard and get it right away but it costs a bit more fee.
@_date: 2016-03-27 03:15:19
:) nice 
@_date: 2016-03-27 01:04:09
Ofcourse it would, who wants to hold Bitcoins if they know one person can print triple the amount of coins every minute :) . Not me! 
It would be the same in hyperinflation cases in countrys with fiat currency. Nobody will want the currency and it will end in zero as it always does.
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:21:14
I make a little sense, as it already happened according to teh guy in a reply below. But once they saw it the fixed it immediately. But till that point they had some value.
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:04:32
I read another report also of an investment bank, saying the opposite, that bitcoin is overvalued by 250$.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:27:27
WHat you mean? The market makes teh price right??
@_date: 2016-06-08 05:17:21
I understand, but can  mean miners NOW can make a profit if they didnt receive BTC rewards at all? Because if they cant make a profit without a reward now, why would they be able to make a profit after there are no BTC to mine anymore? Understand my point? And then I would think after 21 million coins are mined, that they only would 'mine' with higher fee's.
@_date: 2016-03-27 02:25:16
Wire it is not fastest way to get bitcoins. You shouldn't do that.
@_date: 2016-06-21 04:06:39
Its all good, we can trade again.
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:45:03
I am just saying that the site could be hacked and they let people download a bad file. Change is like 0, but still I dont like the chance. Can happen with every site and i heared you can verify with signature or something but its to hard for me lol.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:25:23
I need my coins safe today. I have them in exchanges which I dont like. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:28:43
What woudl you do if you dont have time to buy a trezor?
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:15:33
This will just put a higher bairrer from crypto companys to operate there. That is not bad.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:45:39
can i trust this one?
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:08:58
And when is block 419328? Is it befor teh halving or after?
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:27:28
But there are already transaction fees. And Bitcoin miners having a hard time already and for sure after next halving. So that means people doing it for transaction fees would want more money so higher fees, right?
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:10:07
What is a 'checksum'
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:40:55
Just that I dont feel comfortable having much coins in an exchange, I already lost coins in Gatecoin hack .
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:28:04
But the thing is if I download electrum it can be hacked and preprogrammed with addresses. Where I download it from, github? I need be 100% sure its safe.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:25:39
I need my coins safe today :(
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:46:59
But then I have to trust the trezor. Also not 100% sure its not preprogrammed to hack ur stuff? I am paranoid as the coins is to much worth for me.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:21:36
Why? lol because Ethereum is booming and ETH holders also woudl like to spend it in shops! Obviously they added it.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:26:58
I only want it on my own computer and on some pendrives to be sure if I get a harddrive failure. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:53:41
I mean more when there is NO mining at all anymore. When all bitcoins are in existence.
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:50:44
Is is already tested on a sort of testnet? 
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:43:10
if any impact its down, a rate cut is up
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:59:18
I know, but Electrum is downloaded from a site.
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:48:09
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:58:15
True, but a few months is a long time :)
I have a Multibit classic wallet from some years ago, maybe i use that one as never coins had been stolen. But everybody say uts not safe and shoudl upgrade to Multibit HD.
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:58:50
rate hike is expected for so long, I also think it wont do anything at the price at all, but a rate cut is another story and migth be the beginning of a long time force in price gain as it shows the recovery was never there, only held up on financial heroine and people then finally realizing in how bad shape the US and teh rest of the world really is.
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:55:23
Agreed, in the end its the better option, no bail out.
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:35:34
This will be bad for Ethereum and the price of ETH. This is what you bitcoiners like right? :) I was in ETH but now I am out for sure!
@_date: 2016-06-06 03:08:37
'Usually, Bitcoin users have to wait hours before a Bitcoin transaction is approved.'
Lol what a BS article.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:30:11
True, but I can have that seed on multiple pendrives located in multiple places, which i prefer. But my point is more that I want to be safe with the hacking aspect. Not of me losing my stuff.
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:20:00
You are pretty dumb...
@_date: 2016-06-18 19:57:06
How do we know tresor is 100% safe
@_date: 2016-06-25 18:18:48
If you have Bitcoins or Ethers and wanted to buy something with it you do not need to convert it back to fiat yourself, that is why people want to use it and not apple pay or android pay.
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:18:16
sorry this one&gt;&gt; 5HpHagT65TZzG1PH3CSu63k8DbpvD8s5ip4nEB3kEsreAvUcVfH 
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:27:59
This didnt answer my question. I liek to know if I could get problems like suddenly losing my coins, or will that never happen?
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:40:50
'Yes there are transactions on the first few of the first page of that site because people sent small amounts to those addresses for the lolz after the site had been publicized'
This is incorrect. If they would send small amounts to those addresses on first page they wouldnt be able to transfer it out again. 
What happened is the owner of the site puts his old addresses in there.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:25:52
On the Multibit website it says for costumers of MB classic to update asap. But I dont like the HD version, I wanna keep using MB classic, will I get problems if I dont upgrade?
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:42:09
And yes I know, I was shocked about this but realised teh guy put up his old addresses on first second and last page. I LOLLED alot when i found out.
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:01:46
Maybe lower your prices will make you succeed! To expensive lol
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:34:56
It has to be .KEY or.key right??   I coudl change it to .txt in windows but need .key i read
EDIT: .txt its not good, my wallet doesnt read it
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:23:00
Bad investment? I am up already 320% lol!
@_date: 2016-05-25 22:37:25
One of teh reasons i didnt upgrade to HD is that I cant have AMP tokens (or other sort of tokens/coins) send to an address in HD. At least someone told me that. Or it was that I cant send those from HD to another bitcoin address.
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:35:00
Bitcoin rise consolidating
breakout above 15$
New release: Metropolis with dApp store for mass adoption and huge media attention and on top of that hype
etc etc
@_date: 2016-05-29 20:55:54
Lol, I found a couple of private keys in use..... so thats like a million times impossible?
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:11:53
I did just that.... It works now.
@_date: 2016-05-29 16:19:33
It was the break out.... so obvious, yes capital fligth has to do with it probebly but the break out was the important point. Once it breaks out it keeps going up obviously. And it will stop going up like crazy in an almost stright line when it reaches next area of resistence, and not what you would say other reasons.
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:50:32
rtf is the extension of the text edit file. Cant a wallet read this?
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:27:04
I can't change the file extension :( damn it
I know i did wrong but i have in text file. Wont do again.
@_date: 2016-05-29 15:24:25
470 usd was another number in chinese exchanges, it broke that number....  i said usd as we look at usd graph, could have said tge number in chinese exchanges but those nimbers dont say anything at all for 99.99% of people,YOU sont make sense !
@_date: 2016-05-29 17:11:32
Not spend more time in it sorry. But it looks nice :) Would buy one maybe if it was cheaper.
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:16:39
1E1NUNmYw1G5c3FKNPd435QmDvuNG3auYk  upload it
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:00:50
Just broke long time support line around 470, ofcourse it shoots up after it breaks. No news at all, just technical.
Guess it will stop between 600 and 630.
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:27:43
Look at first couple of private keys
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:37:00
You mean teh excitement in ETH will start to get crazy once it breaks 15$. That will probably happen when bitcoin is around 600$ because bitcoin will consolidate for a while. ETH to go to 70+ this year, no brainer.
@_date: 2016-07-03 17:39:39
If you are broke you can't buy bitcoins. So the thing you should do is to stop using this forum.
@_date: 2016-07-09 01:47:28
I looked at it but I don't see where I can upload my private key. I guess it is not possible in this wallet?
