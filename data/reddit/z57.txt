Nice. I'm a bit drunk, so excuse the wording of my question, but how would a merchant go about accepting bitcoin? Simply make a wallet to receive payment? That is all? Or is there an extra step or two? I'm sure this had been asked, but as mentioned, I drunk at bar and on phone.

Cool thanks

The others I agree with, but I wouldnt call AppleTV a failure. It has made Apple $1billion. And while that's small compared to some of other of their products. It's still 1000 million...

Map Monopoly how so? Serious question

Well... If they're buying this photoshopped bullshit then maybe you have a point. 
That said, it's great to see BitCoin on a commercial.

They may sound like fans but isn't Jeff Bezos  a huge backer in Über? I will be shocked, happy, but shocked if über stars accepting Bitcoin.

Curiously how did you get them to implement it on their site?

It is surprising to me that this simple illumination of the TSA/NSA fallacy did not come-to-light/resonate with the populace shortly after 9-11. Would have saved the nation and world so much shit.

Use bitfloor.com
 I was able to convert USD cash in hand using a bank if America wire transfer to Bitfloor then into BTC using bitfloors exchange, all this was done within 50 minutes. Boom done

Ha sorry, I know the question sounds stupid  or from a different angle but if i am about to buy 1 widget for .00000001 (8 places) and then the decimal changes and the community is able to buy things for .000000001. (9 places) then eventually 1 widget (the same widget) may cost .000000001
A pizza used to cost 10,000 btc now a pizza is roughly .7 BTC (when pegged/companied to USD)

Bitfloor.com takes bank of america cash wire transfers. I turned USD into BTC in 50min. From start to finish (entering bank to BTC in my wallet).

Simply because of the very fact there is not much to go off of as a basis of legitimacy. If a typo is on the first page it doesn't bode well for quality of services X company will render. Pretty much like a typo in a resume. 
That said, it's a cool idea.
 Edit: just read comments below regarding the business plan and the hopes it will give legitimacy to BitCoin in the eyes of Amazon. Love it. Hope it works.

What timescale do these graphs show? 
@_date: 2013-05-27 02:54:44
Finally! What exchange(s) the app referencing? And what is the lag time? The value currently reflected in the app is different (~$4 USD higher) than any exchange on Bitcoinity.

Bitfloor.com so much easier for someone in the US

I put mine on eBay the day I received it In the mail. Luckily it was during the bull run to $1000 a coin. Wound up selling it for $449 USD. I'm happy with that result. 
BFL is an absolute shit company.

This answers my question as well. Thank you

Oh shit! I forgot about the 'ol 9Mil USD Pizza. Such tasty pepperoni. So very tasty

Excellent. Thank you

At a time it cost 10,000 BTC for a Pizza, now a pizza costs about .7 BTC. Eventually it may cost .1 BTC  then years from now it could cost .0001 etc.... Eventually the supply of BTC will be so limited that moving the decimal to 9 would make more division  possible. But instantly 1 BTC is worth much more, after you divide it down. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:00:45
I figure this. My question is hypothetical and I'm trying to understand how btc is protected from devaluation by creating 10x the possible by changing the possible decimals. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 05:34:12
How do you mean? Yes, it is true it has never yet moved. But I read in various posts that it could move. Its arbitrarily set at 8 (which I believe is called a statoshi) Say if there was becoming a limited supply of bit coin due to lost wallets, passwords and the like, once 21mil BTC are mined.

I love typos in a subject :/ 
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:04:53
Use bitfloor
@_date: 2013-03-14 07:42:36
Curiously, what was the outcome of this situation?
@_date: 2013-03-13 08:31:42
Excellent logic, very true
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:45:40
Interesting percent breakdown. I've never read an analysis from this perspective. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:03:14
This is true. However if I had to choose between time spent waiting for mtgox vs paying slightly higher, I would choose slightly higher. Especially over the past week. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 05:56:54
I do. It's like BTC experience reverse inflation. And that is a Weird, but cool concept.  My whole point of the question is if the decimal place changed then the people with BTC would have more buying power, compared to USD.
