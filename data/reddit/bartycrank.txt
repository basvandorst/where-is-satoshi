My 1989 workstation maxed out at 128MB of RAM.
28 Years. Doubles every two, 14 cycles.
2014 workstation, 32GB of RAM. 8 cycles. We're at least that far behind schedule.
We should be at 2TB of RAM in my current workstation.

I think there's a simple litmus test for that one.
Can you make transactions with it on the Bitcoin network?
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:18:02
This isn't an oscillation, though. This is the hashrate of BCH dropping to zero every time BTC becomes more profitable to mine. With how important mining is to the functioning of a cryptocurrency, how long is one that's designed to be abandoned every time the difficulty adjusts going to last?

Can you spare some of that equipment? The mental gymnastics it would take to convince myself that a fork of Bitcoin that only became available a week ago somehow existed just as long as Bitcoin are a little beyond my grasp right now. Or is this something like "Business founded in the 1900 has over 100 years of experience" thing? Because that doesn't quite mesh either.
Can I fork Debian and say my distribution has been around just as long?

we're literally in a world where people redefine things to suit their purposes, the arguments lose meaning when their terms are so loosely defined.
The Bitcoin network is Bitcoin. Forking off into another network is not Bitcoin. The Bitcoin network is built up of a lot more than just the miners that are trying to take it over.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:10:35
It puts them in an incredibly weak position, I hope they understand. What value does a miner have that abandons the mine at the drop of a hat? They'll simply be replaced by miners that actually bring their value, rather than walk away with it.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:47:48
These people seem to totally miss the fact that the miners are the transaction processors, not the people making the transactions. They are threatening to screw the actual users of Bitcoin, the people who actually use their service, by following the miners who are threatening to abandon them.
Do they honestly expect the people actually using the coin to jump ship? Do they honestly expect the entire Bitcoin ecosystem that has been built up to enable payment processing to just magically jump to an alternate chain in a smooth manner?
Congratulations on screwing everyone because the miners decided that they are more important than literally everyone else in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I'm not sure how to put this but there is a significant infrastructure necessary to interact with a platform like this that doesn't give a damn how low income the people who need it most are. If we are talking an economy where just having the equipment to hold and trade digital information is that big of a workload, there are way bigger issues that need to be resolved than the fees. I'm talking basic digital infrastructure, not advanced stuff like Bitcoin.
There is a huge disconnect between the wish to bring this technology to the world over and the feasibility of actually using it the world over. I can't even fathom the concept of caring about Bitcoin if technology itself is so far out of reach.

There's no need to FUD about it on throwaways. Cryptocurrency is establishing itself, right now.

One block before the hard fork is supposed to activate? This is interesting.

It shot all the way up to .6 BTC per petahash per day while I was watching it over the last few days. In order to make it useful you need to have a lot to throw at it and hope your deposit doesn't end up in confirmation hell.

They're open about the EDA being designed to kill the competing chain. The hardcore BCH trolls are open and honest about their intent to kill and supplant the main Bitcoin chain, while in the same breath calling the idea of any of it being an attack ludicrous. It's pretty funny.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:18:47
The end user equipment still costs far, far more than a single transaction does. We are already in that dystopian global megacity with the big money making the decisions while the rest of the world goes on for the ride, because they have little choice. I say the scaling issues are entirely separate from issues of areas with poor economies, but they'll become part of the issue when they get there.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:00:48
I think that this perception is based on focusing on transaction fees while ignoring the rest of the system and how it works. Right now we have the primary Bitcoin chain stalling out while most of the SHA-256 mining power is mining Bitcoin Cash for profit. This will continue until the Bitcoin Cash chain reaches its standard difficulty adjustment about 1023 blocks from now. In order to remain the more profitable chain at that point, the price gap between the coins needs to continue to shrink. Hard to say either way, a lot can happen in the next day.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:01:19
It's not a difficulty system that works, it's a difficulty system designed to slowly ramp up and build difficulty until it is the longest chain with the most accumulated difficulty, then 'checkmate.' It's explicitly designed to attack the 2016-block retargeting chain, not work...
On a technical level, we have a sophisticated stress test of the technology.
On a human level, the standard raging zealotry.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:54:55
The cost for SHA-256 hashing shoots through the roof and you would have to outbid the entire market to move enough of it.

I have many words to describe the people who bought into that B2X futures nonsense and none of them are "holder."

The only thing it gained by being 'uncensored' is straight carpet bombing against Bitcoin. The signal to noise ratio is garbage with the number of people pushing silly propaganda while denying basic technical aspects of cryptocurrency. This subreddit has a far higher signal to noise ratio because of it, despite 'censorship.'
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:40:04
See, the really scary thing is that anyone might expect the Bitcoin technology to retain value if it's able to be screwed around with like that. The resilience of the main chain is a litmus test for whether cryptocurrency has long term potential. The forkers, try as they might, are either going to prove its value or destroy it.

My GPU hashes Bitcoin at around 20 kilohashes per second.
Those little USB miner sticks do 333 kilohashes per second.
Hashrate contracts throwing around terahashes and petahashes, dozens to hundreds of antminer style units at the least.
The difficulty prevents the GPU from being useful even all of the rest of the hash power has left, unfortunately.

I think you're claiming a key someone never used can be proof of their identity. I could generate my own key, paste the public portion into this thread and declare that you are not TXTCLA55 until you sign a message with that key, and it would be effectively the same.

Don't forget that Bitcoin and Gold empower each other. Gold isn't just a store of value, gold is a useful thing that provides functional value. Among the wide array of purposes are the electronics that make up the infrastructure that powers Bitcoin. It's going to remain as strong as ever relative to other things.

Your graph ends the day before that dip in BTC hashrate.

If you had your bitcoin in a local wallet, you could just copy your wallet.dat to the altchain client to get your altchain coins in that last chain split.
Not so easy with a contentious hard fork that intends to overpower the main chain.
Especially not so easy when you're an exchange that keeps the majority of bitcoin in cold storage for security purposes.
Even if the fork takes the steps necessary to allow a clean split, the accounting and modifications necessary to correctly distribute the altchain coins within the exchange software are non-trivial.
It's great that many of these websites have been able to properly support and split the recent altchain, but it's totally ridiculous to expect the same of 2x from anyone.

No, the key needs to have been used by Satoshi to sign a known proven message by Satoshi for the key to be considered proof in that context. Where is the message that he previously signed to show that it was ever possible for him to do so?
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:20:01
I'm really curious, can you link me to a message that Satoshi signed?
Because I need some proof that it's Satoshi's key and that he signed messages with it. Otherwise it's time to bin this red herring.

Smart either way. He understands the utility but doesn't understand the technology that provides the value he doesn't see.

I wonder if you've ever used early UNIX systems?
I'm not about to downplay the contributions of the GNU Project over the years - certainly not.
But I'm not giving them GNU/Linux anymore.
That ship sailed years ago. There are too many alternatives for the core UNIX utilities available. Too many folks are living in the browser now. Too many users are on Android, which is a distribution of Linux where you are not interacting with the GNU userland in any meaningful way.
GNU is still the best implementation of a UNIX-like userland by far, in my opinion.
But Linux is not GNU.
