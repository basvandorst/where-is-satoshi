If you use a cost basis of zero and you get audited, you really think the IRS is going to complain that you paid to much tax? My point about the year was more about the price disparity over the last year.  For simplicity's sake, say you bought for 1k more than a year ago and just sold for 20k.  The difference in cost basis between 0 and 1k is negligble. 2850 in tax versus 3000.

If you bought mostly before 2017, you could report a cost basis of zero as well.  That would negate the need for any paperwork proof. The savings in taxes versus a more accurate cost basis would be small anyway because of the giant run up in the price.

This reminds of when the internet first started being a thing, before Yahoo and Google existed, the only way to find a website was if you knew the exact address.  So TV commercials would tell you the website of the company that the ad was for (not many).  I would watch TV with a pad of paper and write down the web addresses so that I'd have places to visit on the web. That feels like bitcoin now, randomly seeing businesses adopting it.
TLDR:  Watching Bitcoin business adoption feels like business website adoption in the early nineties.

As a bitcoin consumer, the benefits I derive from it aren't all about buying stuff.  But here's a short list of why I hold Bitcoin and spend it.
1. If you bought Bitcoin more than three weeks ago, it's worth more than when you bought it. While this won't always be the case, I do believe it will continue to grow year over year.
2.  No bank means no bank fees, no freezing or closing my account on a whim.  No taking money out of my account with out my permission.  No 3-5 business days to electronically get money in or out of it.
3.   Using Bitcoin to buy things means I have to turn over less personal information to random business on the Internet when I buy things.  No more credit card phishing, less chance of identity theft.
4.  With the rise of the Internet, and quite a few different ways of pointing out if a company is screwing over customers, I'm not overly concerned with the lack of a charge back option.  I've also seen companies send debt collectors after people who've used charge backs before.  Do I really want to get in a grudge match that might ruin my credit rating?
5.  I've already seen where businesses offer discounts for using cash or Bitcoin because of the lack of payment processor fees.  I like taking advantage of these lower prices.
6.  Bitcoin is an international currency, so I can buy things anywhere on the planet, if the business takes Bitcoin, and I can convince them to ship to my country.  Which, they're more likely to do because there is no possibility of a charge back.

1.  If you look at Bitcoin as a platform and not just as some crazy volatile store of value, you already have third parties like BitPay and Coinbase to erase that risk in the volatility.  Hell, using Coinbase as your payment processor is free for your first $1M in transactions and they'll do immediate conversions to USD, if you so choose.  At that point it's free and no risk to the business and you open up your self to new markets/demographics.  And because the payment processor is uncoupled from the currency, you drive innovation and competition, unlike Visa/Mastercard, et al.
2.  So if your checking account had a 100% APR interest rate, you wouldn't pay your bills or buy a present for someone?

The only way to mine right now and not completely piss away money is by a specialized bit-coin ASIC mining machine.  Any standard PC you build for 5-6k won't earn you $100 in BTC ever.  If you buy [this]( and actually get it in January, you'll make some decent BTC, but still never make up for the price of the machine.

This is the reason I said less information not none.  I'm not looking to avoid taxes or hide my purchase price history from the feds.  And if I was worried about that, there are ways to mitigate that, like you using a unique address for every purchase (trivial) or using a mixing service.

1) Even if this is a bubble, every single time so far that a BTC bubble has popped, the price rises past it.
2) Day trading is a a lot like gambling and just as dangerous to your bottom line.
3) All altcoins seem to be riding a BTC rise.  I predict they'd also follow a BTC fall.
4) Bitcoin is a protocol, so it's probably better to compare it to something like Bittorrent.  Which despite having a target on it's back still seems to be doing pretty well.  And can never be shut down because it's decentralized.

If you used the default settings on the official client, it would be about $1.  Some one will tell me if I'm wrong, but I think it's based on the amount of addresses in your wallet you're combining to send the BTC.
@_date: 2013-02-01 16:31:55


 -If you add an additional payment to your bet transaction, sending exactly 0.00543210 BTC to a separate address, the payout for the bet will go to that address. 
 -In the standard Bitcoin client, this is done by clicking the "Add recipient..." button. 
 -The first payment in the transaction must go to SatoshiDICE with your bet amount, and the second payment in the transaction must go to [yournewaddress] with the amount of 0.00543210. If you win, all the money will then be sent to [yournewaddress]. Fun!

I'd also pick Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Not a fan of North America for privacy.

You do have a good point.  I love the "You just gave that guy money?  How the hell did you do that?" reaction you see in other subreddits.

You could raise the PP price while lowering the BTC price, citing the high cost of PP transactions.  So you could still end up at 50% between the two without killing your business.
Also adding or link to a tutorial on how to acquire BTC would help.

You can already do this.  Check out virwox.com.  You can use PayPal but they limit you to relatively small amounts and kill you in fees to make up for the risk.  I actually used them before CoinBase existed.
