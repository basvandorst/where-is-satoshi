Can it say assault rifles instead of guns? And Bitcoin instead of Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:22:38
Ok cool, thanks for the info.

Fuck you for even suggesting that.  You must be brand new here so I'll fill you in, the entire purpose of Bitcoin was to get away from the government.  And how exactly does insider trading cause people to lose money?  Should all trading be frozen until we make sure everyone in the world has the exact same information?  People always have different levels of knowledge and insider trading happening would make volitility slow down a bit and actually help most people.

What is the long term effect of the LN?  As I understand it, once block rewards are done then transaction fees are the only way miners make money correct?  Does the lightning network get rid of mining incentives in the long term? (I realize this is a problem that is many years in the future, but then again so was the block limit)

With the increase in the fees bitcoin has become unusable for small transactions so a bunch of people have started calling it a store of value instead of electronic cash.

Yeah, kind of like how no one buys any electronics because they can always just wait for a few months and get better products that are cheaper.

I do, he's hilarious.  Did you ever see his guide on how to uninstall the antivirus software? 
Wired also did a really interesting article on him a few years ago that's worth a read.

Is there a documentary on Netflix or something?  I know he's done some crazy stuff to like fled a country because of a murder charge, claimed he was developing some drug in a jungle compund in South America to troll a drug forum, sent government officials laptops with spyware to spy on them, dated a teenager he met when she tried to kill him, etc.  He's definitely eccentric, but for a more serious side he did run for the libertarian presidential nomination against Gary johnson, I'm sure there are some debates on YouTube where he explains his philosophy.

How many BTC did he take?
@_date: 2016-06-12 22:57:22
It's lower for the same reason Huobi has had a premium.  The ease of moving fiat currency.  It's more difficult, or at least seems riskier to move fiat currency onto BTC-e, therefore the fiat is worth more on that exchange because of the lower supply.

That article essentially says wikileaks is fine and their twitter account hasn't been taken over because the twitter account said so...

Isn't there a limit of Rs 4000 per day and about a two hour queue at the banks?  The article I read about it seemed very alarmist, can you describe things from your perspective?  (assuming you are in India)

As far as I know negative nominal yields haven't ever happened before, certainly not at this scale.  So I don't think it can really predict anything.  All I'd say confidently is that it means investors are expecting almost everything else to go down more than whatever the negative yield is.  Otherwise you'd never buy something that is a guaranteed loss.

Google dollar cost averaging.  With something as volatile as bitcoin that's probably the only purchasing strategy that makes sense, in my opinion.

The reason a lot of people are attracted to bitcoin is because it's hard money.  My guess would be a majority of people here would like a return to the gold standard.
