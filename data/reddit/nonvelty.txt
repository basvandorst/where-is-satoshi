Are they in freefall because bitcoin is, however.

Thanks, how much lower fees are we talking about? Is it the same sat/byte fee but less bytes are needed?

A quick google brings this as a probable source, at least that one has content greater than zero:

I suppose most accounting softwares don't support bitcoin units.
How is will this affect your ledger and tax forms? A manual entry based on today's dollar value?
(I suppose it's similar to being paid in a foreign currency but I know nothing about accounting.)

That answer was already in the question.

Maybe cash out to a couple of different accounts if you're withdrawing sufficiently to notice.

Yeah, with the worst user interface possible.
 - The fee only shows up in the tool tip when dragging the slider
 - I need to open the Preview screen to see summary of the total + fee (per unit and and actual)
 - I need to switch the units from the options constantly from mBtc and sat/kB because I want my account in mBtc and my fees in sat/kB and it only shows one unit at a time for the whole program.
 - Cannot see sat/B either, so I need to multiply shit constantly
Seriously I hate open source for that, superb software with toilet level UI.

This wiki article didn't explain what the "Banana principle" expression means, and it wasn't obvious to me.
Apparently, the  **banana-principle** means deliver early and let it ripen with the customer, similar to how green bananas are transported and sold, rather than ripe ones.
