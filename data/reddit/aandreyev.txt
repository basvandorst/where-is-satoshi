wow, that's harsh. Actually I wanted to buy some xrp, but it should be done through btc/eth. So the only option is to buy eth? Or maybe there are places out there where one can buy xrp using card/paypal?

perfect, thank you! What is the best place to buy litecoin? I mean it doesn't matter from what point or coin I start, anyhow I must use an exchange for that, and as I mentioned above, every major one have halted new registrations and verifications.

cool, will try both. thank you

that's the exact problem, coinbase is unavailable in my country yet. And on the other exchanges my verification is "in progress" for quite some time now due to heavy loads.

you mention paxful in your conversations at least 24 times for the last 4 days, are you a part of marketing team, or somehow involved?

Exactly! Copying from my other reply: Actually I wanted to buy some xrp, but it should be done through btc/eth. So the only option is to buy eth? Or maybe there are places out there where one can buy xrp using card/paypal?

coinbase is unavailable in my country and all the above are just out of service or have putter new registrations on hold.
Kraken, Gatehub, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitfinex

yes, as far as I know, you're correct. The problem is, as I mentioned in the title, all major exchanges are out of service, have paused registration etc.
