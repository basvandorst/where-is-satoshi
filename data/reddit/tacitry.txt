I just had the same realization. Eesh.

Real talk, I know this is an unpopular opinion but what’s the end game of holding? 
I’m fairly new to bitcoin, I bought it at 3 something and just sold most of it at 13. I have no interest in buying any more. Like, that’s a pretty insane return and I can now walk away happy and put the money somewhere with 8%+ returns. 
Shouldn’t the end goal be to walk away happy?

Right but most (wealthy) people don’t sit for years on piles of cash, they invest it in diverse, stable long term portfolios to accrue tangible earnings over time. 
Holding on bitcoin is literally forfeiting your right to a stable, annual yield for those monies invested—which is absolutely fine but at a certain point it doesn’t make financial sense to continue holding—you have to compare your investment to other types of investments and determine at what price is the financially sound time to sell.  In other words, when you buy you should at the very least have a vague idea at what point you’ll sell (for me that was when it tripled in value, which it did and then some).

Banks offering 8% interest? What? 
That link is just the S&amp;P 500. Find yourself a fiduciary or someone to manage your money if you don’t believe in stable returns. Bitcoin carries massive risk relative to actual, diversified portfolios.

Cheap US videographer here, that’d cost you way more than $100.
