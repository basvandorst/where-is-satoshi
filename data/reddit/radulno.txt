Where's the pride and accomplishment there ? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:35:22
There is others, right now there are companies that will be huge in years. Just have to find the right ones ;)

In general billionaire parents have billionaire kids yes.

Yeah and if you using it as a get rich thing, 2040  will be way too late to sell anyway. If that's a speculation bubble it will be over well before that.

There was one point you could have bought Apple, Amazon, Tesla or any other stock dirt cheap. Hindsight is 20/20.

I'm not speaking of medical research though?
And yes socialised is a good word not free. And I'm not some right wing against it, I'm not American and I have probably one of the most generous system of "socialised healthcare" in my country

Lol are those people dumb ? Like even if you don't know anything about BTC price, you probably have heard of it at this point (due to the late 2017 media craze) at least so you know what it is and it's very likely to be worth more than one dollar. And what the fuck will you do with one dollar anyway ? Might as well bet on it.
Also he doesn't actually give the BTC (or the dollar), liar !!
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:20:58
Probably not, the mainstream media are just starting to talk about it.

The question is still to replace FIAT money and the other cryptos aren't better placed than BTC for sure but technologically they would be. The world economy can't run with BTC as a main currency.
Also, the 30M holders (which isn't a lot at all compare to the people that are using FIAT money in the world) are at 99% just there for making money and don't spend it. Holders won't help to make it a true currency.

Free healthcare doesn't exist. Even in the countries that have what you call free healthcare, you pay for it in taxes taken on salaries. It's just public (and forced) health insurance instead of private (so no research of profit which is better for people)
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:37:57
Uh ? That's really not what the chart is saying though.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:16:28
Bitcoin is pretty terrible for the technology itself, there are far better crypto alternatives if you hope for it to be used as a true currency at a large scale.

And 2 times more pizza, that is not negligible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:57
There are more and more places proposing it as a form of payment. Serious and billions dollars companies. Hell takeaway.com and Steam propose to pay in BTC now. I would say it's more and more seen as a currency.

But the thing is what is the happiness that 1$ give you ? Like if it was 100$, I could see it, you can buy some decent stuff or make a very nice night out or several really. But 1$ ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:18:09
So the value should skyrocket at this point no? How far along are we towards the existence of all BTC possible? 
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:17:53
Not really once everyone will have taken their slice, there'll be no one left
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:19:24
I'm not American lol, I'm living in one of the countries with the most generous of those system.
Just a precision because a lot of people always say free healthcare and it's just wrong. If you're in good health, it's more expensive than nothing at all.

13000% means x130, not x13000. And his entire life savings were obviously not zero.

It's kind of the same strategy than index funds for stock markets. You don't get the maximum ROI sure but you limit the risks and efforts and overall you still grow your investment. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:45:12
Another stupid question, how is the value of those new B2X coins are decided at the beginning (after it gets balanced with sell/buy orders like the others) ? Is it like equivalent to BTC (which I doubt) ?
