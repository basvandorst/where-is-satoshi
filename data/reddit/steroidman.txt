That iPhone isn't making your kid any more tech savvy than you were at the same age.  Let's not pretend your kid has a clue about how any of that works or is showing interest.

You're either into learning tech or you're not.  Shifting time 10 years in either direction isn't going to teach you systems or programming you have to be a self starter.

The point is don't use SMS.  If you don't trust google then use a different authenticator I don't care.

Why does your BMW have a Supra badge?

That means he was using SMS as 2FA and that's been known as exploitable for years.  My company blocked that as a 2FA measure years ago.  Using an app based 2FA like Google authenticator or Authy would have prevented this as those are not tied to sim cards.

You live in the United States, there is plenty of opportunity for those that seek to better themselves.  Liberal politicians pander to voters who will never do what it takes to better themselves they just want more free shit paid for by the middle class.

Why is the US the only country that gets called out for wanting secure borders?  Even Germany a very socialist nation does not fuck around with illegal border crossing.  My FiL is a retired SWAT member and regularly helped the border patrol with keeping gang activity under control.  The type of scum that crosses the border illegally are some of the worst people you will find out there.  One group of gang members thought it was funny to make fathers fuck their own daughters at gun point to entertain themselves as they would smuggle these people in.  The media does not report on this shit because it does not fit the liberal agenda.

Why are you in this sub?  If bitcoin makes you rich I guarantee you will abandon your liberal roots.  I'm conservative because I'm not poor.

Y2K did present some problems and it wasn't all computers just the ones designed in the 80s that only had 2 digits to represent a year instead of 4.  Some ATMs just started spitting out money.
