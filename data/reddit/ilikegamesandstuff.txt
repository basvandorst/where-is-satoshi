Yeah, and the rest of his platform is pretty good IMO. But I think he's very unlikely to win. My people still need to learn how to vote responsibly.

Oh yeah, John R Cristy. One of the few climatologists that doesn't back the hypothesis of human-made climate change. A creationist and former member of the dissolved conservative think tank George Marshall Institute.
A group that has lobbied for such wholesome things as:
* tobacco not causing cancer
* second-hand smoke not having any negative effects
* acid-rain not really being a thing
* CFCs not depleting the ozone layer
Truly a respectable source and an example for scientists everywhere.
Here's an article reviewing the methods of Mr. Christy, have a fun read:

Why I'm so defensive? I'm obviously a shill, paid by Hillary Clinton and George Soros to argue with idiots online. Dude, you replied to every single one of the people calling out your bullshit, who's defensive here? What's "quite interesting" is the absolute lack of any content to your arguments, if you can even call your low effort posts that.
I cant believe I have to even tell you this, but climate scientists livelihood **does not depend on climate change being real**. They are **very** far from being wealthy as most scientists have anual salaries below $100k. They get paid to publish research, not to push an agenda. You'd know this if you actually tried talking with one of them instead of repeating the same shit you hear in your conservative bubble.
And Climategate is a bunch of cherry picked comments from researchers discussing their methods. Retards like you read a couple of out of context sentences and think the whole fucking world is being fooled but not you because oh you're so fucking smart and you know better than to trust those slimy scientists.
Science is a process. It's verifiable. It's reproducible. Like Bitcoin, it's DECENTRALIZED. You're not trusting any particular scientist, you're trusting CONSENSUS.

Pointing out fallacies doesnt win you a debate, kiddo. Thats called the fallacy fallacy. Also, picking one of the 3% of sources that back your position is called the cherry picking falacy.
But go ahead sticking your head in the sand, just be careful of the rising tide.

Scientific consensus is as much an "authority" over climate change as the blockchain is an "authority" over your wallet balance. It's decentralized, it's verifiable and reproducible.
And models and predictions have been consistently wrong? That's just plain FALSE. Do your research.

Taxing the air we breath? I bet you also believe the Earth is flat, don't you, you fucking nimrod?
There are nearly 200 worldwide scientific organizations that agree on this, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and **fucking NASA**. Are they all in the pocket of the Chinese Industry? Are they all part of the "liberal agenda"?
Let me put this as clear as possible so hopefully your willfully ignorant ass can understand it: **There isn't some grand conspiracy about this**.
The effects are fucking clear and measurable. The sea is rising faster, the heat waves are lasting longer, tropical storms are getting more intense. Wake the fuck up.

Of course! Obviously the international scientific community forgot to account for the solar orbit!
[Oh wait, they didn't.](
Bro, seriously, take a good hard look in the mirror and ask yourself: "What makes me doubt that man-made climate change is real?"
Are you looking at what the evidence is pointing to or are you looking for evidence that points to what you want?
@_date: 2019-10-08 22:11:58
Dude, are you omniscient? Cos otherwise at some point you're gonna have to take someone's word about something. And you know, the evidence the scientific community put forth is one google search away. You're the one claiming 97% of climatologists are wrong, so go ahead and prove it. I don't have to lecture you on climate science when the writing is on the fucking wall.
And pointing out that your pet skeptic scientist holds unscientific views and works for corporate lobbying groups is not an ad hominem, I'm just discrediting your source.

It's bitmex contracts, but you can pretty much read them as USD since if I understood correctly 1 contract = 1 USD.

Yes, how the fuck is that so absurd? There are many non-americans here. There are many americans here that don't give a shit about politics. The whole world does not revolve around US politics.
What the fuck even is a "Pepe suporter"? Wow, so the alt-right likes a meme frog, they also like chocolate milk, does that make nesquik fascist?
Your thinking is *too reductionist*.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:39:49
Getting your panties in bunch over a fucking cartoon is precisely the silly shit the "alt-right" wants you to do.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:51:10
Pepe was a simple meme long before the alt-right even existed. They can only appropriate shit like this if you let them.
It's just a meme character using a bitcoin space suit. Do you see anyone here even mentioning the alt-right besides you and me? If the alt-right says Vegeta's saiyan pride represents white pride, does posting "over 9000" memes suddenly becomes dogwhistling?
