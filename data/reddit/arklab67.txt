I think people are annoyed because they added Bitcoin Cash, but I haven't been reading the posts.

I've noticed the exact same thing. This is a very non-technical guess, but I assume since BTC is the standard bearer, when it goes up/down people assume crypto as a whole is going up/down since the others haven't been tested as much. Could be a more complex reason though.

I feel like this especially true if you're young (I'm still in college and putting a lot into crypto).

Haha, I meant the whole thing with the firmware. I saw they weren't on the list and they're way cheaper than anywhere else ($60 and free shipping) but I did send them an email to ask about security.

Even if Bitcoin doesn't replace banks, it will at least stop their seeming monopoly on remittances, etc. and make them a lot less powerful.

So you think this could be a scam set up to steal people's money? Where did you buy your Ledger Nano S?

The email I sent was unable to be delivered, so it definitely seems shady. I just bought a Trezor from Amazon instead.

Yeah Coinbase is fine for starting out, your fees are just a bit higher because they're doing the trading work for you. You should put your coins in a paper wallet when they arrive, but if you're gonna be investing a significant amount of capital I would recommend a hardware wallet.
And just to reiterate, it's worth waiting 8 days to get it if you won't be selling anytime soon anyway.

Sorry, how do I check that? Again I'm new to hardware wallets so I don't even know the basics.

If you're using the direct Coinbase exchange, and not GDAX, you shouldn't have to move money from your bank account, you can just link your bank account to Coinbase.
In terms of waiting a week to get your coins, it depends if you're investing or speculating. If you're investing for the long term waiting won't make a difference and the fee is much cheaper than going through credit card. If you want to speculate and be able to buy/sell quickly, then you should find another route.
