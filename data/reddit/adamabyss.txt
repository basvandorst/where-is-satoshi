Did you get set up yet?
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:35:41
I wonder is there any movement on Satoshi's accounts?

1. Blockchain.info is supposedly one of the most trustworthy wallets.
2. Web, I don't use mobile.
3. See 2.
4. The title was over the top (for dramatic effect) yes, but so are many on this forum. I didn't get angry - you said I got angry, that's different. The story is true, I don't have time for making up stories. If you think it's fishy that's your own business but irrelvant to me. I don't care what dumb journalist writes either, I don't read them. I'm dealing with practical facts here as a business man who uses Bitcoin heavily - not in the sense of some (again irrelevant) journalist's opinion. 
Blockchain.info is advertising to people to 'become your own bank' - they should not be having these kinds of issues on an ongoing basis.

Seems that way yeah. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-08-15 10:03:42
Ok thanks, I see it now: "Insufficient funds for card order. Please deposit at least 0.1 bitcoins".
I'll deposit that now, hope there are no hidden and/or excessive fees.

Thanks a lot.

How long has MISTERTANGO been around guys?
Are they trustworthy?
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:47:01
How do you 'ignore the local IP in the rate limiter' please? I'm not an IT expert. I would just like to get into my wallet. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-09-10 18:46:06
I sent a support ticket but you guys know what the problem is so why can't you just fix it? Please?
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:00:40
I got this support reply from Blockchain.info - it provides a way to get around this issue by using a normal browser and substituting in the normal URL for the onion one:
"We are aware of the issue impacting our Tor page,  This issue is under investigation, but we do not have an exact ETA as to when it will be resolved. Our apologies for any inconvenience this may be causing you. Blockchain.info is still functioning properly. If you receive an authorization email that redirects you to the .onion site, just replace the " of the authorization link with " in a non-Tor browser (we recommend Chrome)."

A different opinion here - it's supposed to be down to Sergei Mavrodi and his latest pyramid scheme:
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:38:21
Same as you said sorillo, except the value looks different on that link than it does in my transaction history.
I have given up trying to figure out how Blockchain.info counts simple numbers, it simply never makes sense. 
They are an unholy mess of an outfit.
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:51:02
Honetly, I would rather use something on my laptop than put my funds onto a phone. So I'm looking for a good, secure and trustworthy wallet to use when the current Blockchain.info debacle is resolved - hoping that it is ever resolved!
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:25:00
Yes, I can provide links I'm sure. I mean, I can see the unconfirmed transaction in my history. Do you want me to put the link here?
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:35:47
Thanks eragmus, I thought Blockchain.info was a 'well-funded professional company' haha! Oh well, I guess I will switch over to Circle or Coinbase - I do already have accounts with both. I am very tech savvy, I have my own online business which I spend most of the day working on, on my laptop. I can't be bothered fiddling around with a phone - each to his own. I mean I use my smartphone a hell of a lot but I don't do any serious work on it. Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:41:52
I got this from them (after I had a new issue - different than yesterday's - their site is a disaster):
"We are still looking into the issues surrounding such problems as wallets displaying improper balances, users unable to send funds, "Maximum concurrent requests" errors, expired authorization emails, as well as a few other errors with our wallet. We want to let you know that we're still working on these issues, but have no estimate as to when they will be resolved. Thank you for your patience with this matter."
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:48:03
Yeah thanks guys, I just logged in to reddit after a few days - doesn't reddit email you when you get replies?
Anyway, the problem with that unconfirmed trasnaction is that as long as it's hanging there the funds are not released back to my blockchain.info balance, so I am down by like £20 or whatever - can't remember what the exact fiat amount was on the transaction.
I just need it tidied up so that I can use the funds for something else - like I say they are frozen in practice right now.
Of course, no one can even get into Blockchain.info right now seeing as they have been down for 10 hours so it's all moot.
That being said, I am helpful for your advice here - do you know how I could get my money back to my balance when Blockchain.info comes back up or will the unconfirmed transaction eventually disappear on its own?
Blockchain.info is so crap!
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:34:42
They finally removed it from my transaction history now, I hope it's gone for good:
For the record, this was the one that I sent successfully for the same amount:
@_date: 2015-10-05 00:59:53
It's all very well going into major technical explanations for this but the fact is most users don't care about the intricate details and just want to use Bitcoin/bitcoin effectively. 
It's up to the technical people involved in Bitcoin to fix this as quickly as possible before the protocol/network/currency etc. loses all credibility among global users. 
Even considering the small amount of transactions that I process on a daily basis, this is a major hindrance to me doing business. 
In fact, it's better for me to 'shut up shop' for a couple of days rather than risking making a mess of my transaction history and accounting records.
Get it fixed as soon as possible please and let us all move on to bigger and better things with Bitcoin. 
It's frankly ridiculous that this has not already been solved. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 22:44:23
I basically can't do any business for the last two days. Luckily I got some cash out today for personal use during a brief period of uptime - about 1 hour until it all fell apart again.
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:27:30
Here it is:
@_date: 2016-07-25 10:52:16
Thanks guys.

What happens if you already have a Coinbase wallet and you receive a tip and a new Coinbase wallet is automatically set up for you?
Can you then amalgamate your two Coinbase wallets or do you have to keep both?
Is there somewhere that you can enter your Coinbase wallet address in advance on reddit so that in the event you DO receive a tip, it will go directly to your existing Coinbase wallet?
Thanks, Adam.
