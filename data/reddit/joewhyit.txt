My bad, lol

Only if you type “5318008” into it. That unlocks the secret mining software in every calculator watch.

USAA and Coinbase are on friendly terms. Gotta be a veteran or related to one (I think) to get an account though. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 12:36:30
Dunno. Either one could happen, depending on the context.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:02:08
Damn it. I was looking forward to dumping those shitcoins after the fork and getting some extra money out of the whole fiasco. Goddamn cockteases. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:40:55
 No. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:20:55
My first guess would be people are selling. Maybe due to unease about how the hard fork’s gonna pan out?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:54:43
I can log in just fine, only to see that the coin I bought a week and a half ago has yet to hit my account. Booooo....
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:12:21
Coinbase has done me alright so far.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:36:42
Taking note, for when I order my Ledger. :D
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:22:18
Isn’t it frustrating as shit? It’s like, I can *see* my goddamn money, but I can’t touch it. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:31:27
Yeah. Don’t buy at 150 a few years ago and then lose your private key. :(
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:39:32
I’ve got a wallet from 2014 that’s got about $500 in btc in it, and the keys are in a file on my PC but it’s encrypted and I can’t remember how to decrypt it. :(
It’ll be a great day when I figure that little puzzle out. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:46:29
And this is exactly why I’m ordering a ledger nano. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:51:19
I’d have gone with something more reliable than a KSG, but whatevs. Call me old fashioned but I like guns that cycle without issues. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:30:13
G’morning. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:33:18
Yeah. Sure does. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:40:54
Ledger Nano S or Trezor.
Don’t take chances with your money, mate. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 01:54:23
Pretty sure that's dependent on what you've got your transaction fee set to. Check your options menu to see if something along those lines is in there, but I don't recommend pulling a dick move  and setting it to like, zero or something like that. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:42:27
I regret that I have but one upvote to give.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:13:23
Eh, good point. Still, it seems, well, polite (if nothing else), ya know?
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:38:00
Good lookin' out, man.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:17:33
Really? Because I was under the impression that it went to whoever processed/confirmed your transaction. Sort of a "Hey, thanks for making my shit legit" tip.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:44:35
Hm. Learned something new today. :D
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:40:37
No doubt. That's a scary fuckin' feeling, when you're like, "Aw shit, that's my password, right fuckin' there where I can see it... Who the fuck else has seen it?!"
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:44:45
Yeah, sorry man. That ship sailed a long time ago. Alternate currencies, OTOH, still have some room for we, the poor, downtrodden GPU miners. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:03:46
Oh, no, I mean, I know that if it's in the clear like that, you might as well write it on a bathroom stall at that point. I was saying for that whole moment of realization when you kinda feel like you just got struggle-snuggled in the prison shower or some such. :D
