I'm here. I think Roman needed to be under criminal investigation/surveillance/full private &amp; business forensic search from day 1, for us to have a chance at recovering our BTC which were claimed to be, IIRC, "hacked" from an unencrypted backup wallet.dat (isn't that criminal negligence at least?)
I'm owed 1.84915808 BTC but will sell that debt at the current spot price to a lawyer who will put a lien or whatever legal means necessary on Roman, and/or claim against government's criminal seizure(s) to recover the BTC (this would be a massive profit for said lawyer, in case the 1.84915808 BTC ends up being worth tens, hundreds of thousands, or millions more in USD, by the time they recover &amp; lawfully own it).

bitcoin-otc.com - it's where I started, and where I have not lost even 1 satoshi. The Web of Trust there makes it so you can trade P2P far safer than with some corporation that insulates its criminally negligent if not actively criminal selves from liability, and/or laterally hires those who should have been blackballed for life from cryptocurrency (looking at you, Coinbase).
Of interest: There was a trust experiment we did there for about 2.5 months in 2013 called Bitcoin Snowball (spreadsheet-ed). "After receiving the snowball, add any BTC amount to it and send it to another willing and trustworthy participant (by your best judgement) who is identified on  Total Value Sent was 57.07263779 BTC.

Anywhere violent criminals can freely walk in, armed, is probably not a good place, unless you have superior armament. If we're talking the police station or Del Taco, that would probably mean you're the police or the fry cook. The police have no duty to protect anyone &amp; civilians don't usually help if they aren't loyal to you for blood, true friendship, or money.
If you're paranoid enough, you'll either insist on having home field advantage, or having the meet on truly neutral ground - just past the x-ray &amp; metal detector screening by sheriff's deputies with guns at a courthouse entrance.

From the seller's perspective, they can have a watch-only wallet &amp; see the TX confirm.
From the buyer's perspective, if they're paying with a private key-holding mobile wallet, they have to worry about the stranger seller robbing them of their mobile while it's unlocked. 
If the seller agrees to lock the BTC price, the buyer can just come with a signed TX from their non-mobile wallet &amp; use a pushtx service in front of the seller, no mobile wallet required.
A seller with good reputation/ratings they can link to their phone # can also request that the payment be made in advance of the buyer's arrival, so that it has time to confirm. There would need to be a refund/no-refunds policy.

So I don't look like an idiot if/when I talk to him, Trace Mayer was on our side (receive S1X, send S2X 1:1) &amp; Roger was the only S1X sender, so the group buy fell through? That's consistent with Roger's PGP-signed explicit refusal of same swap to me, vs radio silence to you.

My offer stands:

The BTC is to be held in escrow. Rather than making an ironclad statement that no matter how much any amount of people can escrow in baby whale chunks of 250 BTC each, up to his total adult whale holdings, he's all in...
He, the operative public figure, is only betting among [friends]( with a hedged-to-the-hilt/extremely low amount vs his total holdings in a [void/voidable contract that needs rescission]( that in actuality only makes a pathetic non-statement and even worse, stands testament to abject illiteracy of the law.
Let's assume for sake of argument that it's only nobodies he's refused; [is Adam Back a nobody? Is Trace Mayer a nobody?](
No, they're public figures, and the escrow agent would be too. [Unserious public figures are unserious]( and so are their stalwart defenders to the last breath.
