What you've said is totally unrelated to what I've said. It's easy to escape capital taxes if you have a brain and use bitcoin. I'm not worried about murder laws, because unlike government crooks, I'm not a criminal.

Fuck US government, I'm not afraid of these crooks, the world is a big place and there are a LOT of ways of not paying these fucking taxes.

The reality is that the market, in general, doesn't give a fuck to fees. Two evidences: segwit isn't used and altcoins with zero fees aren't used.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:55:53
I won't. I will hodl forever, and sooner rather than later I'll be able to buy all things I want directly with bitcoin, without paying capital gains at least. If not in retarded land (USA), in another country.

The cause for economic illiteracy of the mainstream is simple: they follow the wrong school of economic thought (Keynesian). The only economy school capable of properly explain Bitcoin economics is the Austrian school.

I can´t understand the level of desperation of big blockers. Is it because of the activation of segwit next week, that along with LN will show how useless bigger blocks are? 92% of hash power are still mining bitcoin and I doubt it will go away. Stop believing in FUD.
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:05:37
Yes, bitcoin is working as good as ever. Roger Ver paid shills are desperate that Segwit will activate tomorrow and are spamming this sub with transaction fees FUDs.
@_date: 2017-08-20 17:31:15
What a load of bullshit this article is. It implies that bitcoin is controlled by Blockstream, when in fact the 8mb shitcoin is already released and it is a total fiasco. Because, guess what, users don´t give a fuck to bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-26 10:43:33
I know it's extremely frustrating, and you do a good job raising awareness for this type of attack. But if bitcoin does not resist this kind of attack, it is  broke. November is gonna be the greatest resilience test for bitcoin to this day. I don't know if doing nothing is the best strategy in this case, but any defensive action has to be extremely well thought, or we risk screwing up bitcoin irreversibly.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:44:45
Yes, as a clear attempt to steal bitcoin´s userbase it´s a utter failure. Just because it has 2 rich pump and dumpers making transactions with each other, doesn´t mean that it worths shit. It has zero network effect. And I hope fucking Jihan go mine this shitcoin and leave Bitcoin for good.

This is nothing. When bcash totally collapses, Ver will probably delete that sub and hide himself in shame.
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:35:54
I have to say that in this case, doing nothing is also an action that could lead to disastrous consequences. It's a complex situation.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:25:51
Big blockers already have their 8mb shitcoin. Thus there´s no more reason to argue, Bcashers should be banned from this sub (because arguing in favor of bigger blocks is argue in favor of Bcash, which is an altcoin). So if these fuckers want the fight to stop, just go to their on sub, ffs.

Money sovereignty has ONE chance to succeed. We must not accept rich bastards fucking with our money. If people  has to hire hitmans to stop these ruffians, I say go for it. Technical and legal actions are mild measures for all the bullshit that we are about to face.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:49:32
But just increasing the blocksize does not solves the fee problem without disrupting the system, like bcash proved. I think the only realistic way to pay low fees is to wait for lightning, unfortunately. It´s easier for Venezuelans to kill Maduro than bcash starts working properly.
@_date: 2017-08-20 21:31:55
This question is so fucking dumb... Of course bigger blocks cause more centralization. Just think the million number of stores in the world, each one with an incentive to run their own LN hub. Now think about the few thousands of nodes running in the world today. I hope this answer your question.

If Nick Szabo is Satoshi (which I think he is), then Satoshi prefers SegWit over 2x (although he thinks that segwit blocksize increase is its major flaw). If he isn´t Satoshi, then at least he created a "pre-bitcoin" (bitgold).

It's necessary GB sized blocks to achieve Visa levels.

I'm starting to think that it doesn't matter if Bitcoin forks or not. If bizcoin really happens and destroys bitcoin, then I'm ready to trade all my bizcoin and bitcoin (if I see it's gone for good) for the second best alternative, which is now litecoin (or it can be a bitcoin/core coin if it starts to get developed). Bcash already demonstrated that there's a lot of dumb people that will keep the price of anything with bitcoin in the name high for some time, so I'll have more than enough time to dump all my coins to the sheeple. In the long run, I'm sure the most decentralized and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency will win. Actually, it would give a golden chance to enter in that coin very early.

I think Greg meant that a POW change would be done only if most of the miners move to 2x. With such a low hash rate in the original chain, I think the only way to go is to do a POW change.

They are important, but they aren't as easy to measure.

It looks like there is a competition to award the greatest douchebag of the bitcoin community. Let's give it to jgarzik, so he can stop to compete and go on with his fucking life.

It's simple, r/btc is the place of the scum of the crypto world: ponzi promoters, shitcoin and ICOs pumpers, fraudsters and all the enemies of bitcoin. There's also a minority of plain dumb people there, that believes in conspiracy theories. These are the flat-earthers of the crypto world.

The "imperfect" system is capitalism, that works despite government, and not because of it. WTF, anarcho-capitalism is about the non-aggression principle, warlordism is the system we live now.

Great read. But I don't think 2Xers give a damn to knowledge or logic. 2Xers are the flat-earthers of the cryptocurrency community.

There are two possibilities for people that support him: the ones that I'll profit from it and the utterly dumb people.

I just imagined Jeff Garzik reading this, going to b2x repository and saying: "You know what? Fuck this shit". Then he deletes all that crap.

The government is the rich. The rich you refer may have billions, governments have trillions.

Ignore it. It´s just another shitcoin.

What if Bitmain is controlled by the chinese government and their objective is exactly to destroy bitcoin? Every big company in China have members of the communist party in it. And there´s no shortage of incentives for a government to destroy it.

Seriously? I can´t see it [here]( By the way, I just created aircoin, it has a $10 billion marketcap. I´m selling it, do you wanna buy?
