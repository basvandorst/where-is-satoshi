I believe they are improperly using the term ROI. What they mean is payback period, not ROI. Return on Investment (ROI) is expressed in a percentage basis
i.e. if my ROI is 20% after one year then if I spend $1000, I have $1200 at the end of one year. 
The problem with this hardware is that after one year the hardware will not be worth $1000. If they mean that the payback period is one year, then you're investing $1000 at the chance of making a profit *STARTING* one year from when you spend the money, and until that point you have lost money due to owning a rapidly depreciating asset.

Here's the thing "getting hacked" can mean all kinds of different things. customer information stolen. BTC stolen. sometimes, the hackers get nothing. Simply saying they were hacked means next to nothing.

Refinery design engineer here. I follow the oil market relatively closely. I like the idea of using an international currency such as Bitcoin for oil trading. Having recently jumped into cryptocurrencies with both feet, I have been thinking about this a lot (even though I'm from the USA, I don't like the idea of "the petrodollar").
Just so we're clear: is the platform geared toward speculators, arbitrageurs, and traders, or is it geared toward refiners who actually want to *take delivery*? If delivery, I'm assuming you'll need some kind of escrow service to ensure that the refiner actually *gets the oil*.
I know this won't be a popular opinion in but I always envisioned this as an application for a "smart-contract" type crypto currency. Although I don't know of any that are ready for "prime-time" in this application.
edit: I think What you're trying to do here is best implemented through an OpenBazaar decentralized trading platform. Otherwise your website can and will get ddos'ed shutting down the trading platform and potentially costing your customers millions of dollars (for example, in the case of a BTC or WTI/Brent intraday market freefall).

Well I'm no expert here, but I would think payment would be sent based on a set of conditions. 25% when oil is shipped, 50% when delivered, and the last 25% once all specifications (API, TAN, S%, etc.) are tested and met in their final destination. I just kind of thought a "smart-contract" would be the way to implement this, but I'm no smart contracts expert by any means.

If you agree that Bitcoin is a legitimate currency, then the implication in this tweet is false. The sarcastic implication is that Bitcoin is unprofessional. I think the letter could have stated it better (i.e. "also willing to accept Bitcoin"), but the tweet is almost slander on Bitcoin.

The federal income tax and property tax deduction and combined with low interest rates (&lt;4%), means that it almost never makes sense to buy a house in cash. You're actually better off borrowing as much of it as you can, deducting the interest and property taxes, and using your cash for some other investment. Depending on your location, having a fully owned unencumbered asset also means that the asset is more likely to be subjected to frivolous lawsuits, liens, etc.
edit: above viewpoint is USA specific

This is the post I was looking for. Given outsized gains on an initial investment, it's nothing but human nature to take some (or all) the profits and run for relative safety. This isn't wrong thinking, it's hardwired into everything humans do with risk taking. An early ENRON investor "could have" made outsized gains and subsequently outsized losses.
We are simply not wired to allow winnings to multiply 100 fold, and  for the most part this instinct saves a lot of people from making poor decisions. It does also lead an order of magnitude fewer people into taking profits too early.
I have no science to back this up, but this is my general assessment.

I don't disagree with you. The value *would* hypothetically crash if that were to happen. But bitcoin will exist until the last two computers running it shut off.
Think of this: the decentralized networks developed after the shutdown of Napster, gnutella and fastrack network, which ran Kazaa et. al. are still running. Even with all the NSA's, FSB, and Great Firewall's power.

"they" can do that in one country or maybe two or five. But not all 172 (?) countries.
If you ever had an experience in school where the whole class or even multiple classes did something a teacher/professor didn't like, then you understand the power dynamic here. You can reprimand only so many people before it becomes unsustainable. A professor won't be allowed to fail an entire graduating class even if he claims the entire class cheated. There is an approach of "the show must go on" that governs the world that keeps basic systems from overloading.

I completely and totally disagree with you.
Are you still married?
What does your wife think about bitcoin?
What has your bitcoin experience been like since "the post"?
How do you feel about your typo becoming the norm?
I'm sure other people could think up some great questions.

I am a US citizen and resident and am planning to go to Italy in July for my Honeymoon.  Would bitcoin be useful in avoiding or reducing foreign transaction fees?  (I'm not going to get an additional credit card just to avoid the fees.)
Using Bitcoin what is the lowest transaction fee I could get for, say, 500-1000 USD to EUR and how would I go about it?  Would the rate change with the amount changed?  I currently only have USD in US bank accounts.  I'm hoping to cash in on the low USD&gt;EUR exchange rate before the trip.
Thanks in advance!

I fully realize this isn't directly bitcoin related but felt that the risk to bitcoin users was great enough that it warranted a dedicated post on relevant bitcoin communities.
Obviously there will be at least twenty people below this post who will advocated buying a hardware wallet.

I tried to use a 2-way atm in London on vacation last week. The first step was to enter a phone number and wait for a text. I tried my google voice number, my real T-mobile number, and a number from the Burner android app in that order. It accepted my phone number like there was no problem, but I got zero texts. After multiple retrys and waiting 20-30 minutes with my wife and our luggage waiting outside the cramped exchange shop I gave up. I was really disappointed and my wife was pretty annoyed with me :-( 
I never got any texts when I got back to the states either. Other texts and phone calls from the US worked while I was there.

how is going to a "convenience" store easier than putting in your CC info online and literally doing nothing else until the contract expires? Paying online prevents me from having to do anything and prevents me from forgetting to pay the bill.

I've traveled to plenty of other countries and I understand what you're saying about different cultural practices, but my comment was specifically about which practice is actually more *convenient*. One is an active system, the other a passive one.
