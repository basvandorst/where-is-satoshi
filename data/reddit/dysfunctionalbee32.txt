Well then, I’ll have your friend call my friend. Only if he’s hot though...she has standards.

As a woman who LOVES bitcoin, ��.

Wait, is there a boyfriend store I should know about? Asking for a friend, of course...

Well damn, I’ve been going about it all wrong. It would help if I leave my bubble sometime and walk the streets.

I just bought my first tiny piece of bitcoin through Coinbase. Why do I move it out of there and how does that work?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:17:11
Right, I get that they charged a fee of $1.99. But now it says I only have $36.87 in there. That number continues to drop to every few minutes.

Ok last question....I moved it to my wallet, will it still grow in value? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:12:45
Thanks! So, why does my value keep going down in Coinbase? Should I transfer it to a wallet now or keep it until it in Coinbase goes back up?

Yeah, that makes sense. Wow, this is pretty fun! Love how helpful everyone is too.

Yes, that completely helps. Sheesh this is like some really advanced video game and I’m still playing Super Mario Brothers on my Nintendo. I hope I can start figuring it all out soon! Thanks for being so kind and answering my questions.

Yes, it’s blockchain.info and apparently it hates me. I just downloaded bitpay and transferred the money there. Oy vey, this was complicated. I’m a total noob and I appreciate your help!
