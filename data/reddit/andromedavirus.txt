Your story makes no sense. "A Bitcoin" and it was sent to "an address you your Kraken account"? 
Mysteriously just one bitcoin moved from your wallet to your exchange account? Sounds to me like you did that while drunk.
@_date: 2016-09-17 20:55:44
Buy a Trezor and send the bitcoin there.
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:51:52
FUD.

I would say their goal is to remove the limit and then revisit priorities after we stop redlining Bitcoin and driving new users and businesses away. I tend to agree.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:38:45
Can raise the limit now?
@_date: 2016-10-17 13:52:04
You think it's OK to classify someone by where they post instead of considering their ideas independently?
You think you can weight the value of ideas, opinions, or code contributions based on apparent political affiliations?
That's a primitive mentality. It means you are easily led (and fooled, by the way).

Do you think mass adoption turns on like a light switch? It's a curve. See the internet.
Our mass adoption was capped at 1MB.
@_date: 2016-10-16 16:28:44
Impressive? Those stats flatlined nearly a year ago, and are the same for bitcoin users outside of Coinbase.
As widely predicted new users and merchants stopped adopting Bitcoin as we reached a median 1MB blocksize almost a year ago.
Bitcoin isn't growing anymore. That's not impressive. It's a disgrace and core owes us an explanation.

What evidence do you have proving what fraction of the community supports vs. wants to prevent segwit?
How do you define "wealth" when you say that most of the wealth supports the core roadmap?
Calling people who don't agree with you "petty and absurd" divides the community, and is the opposite of what people should be doing to build a strong Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-16 16:30:42
Most of what that guy says isn't true. Read his post history. It's upsetting to read. "Overzealous rush for merchants"? That's exactly is supposed to happen!
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:27:31
Malleability isn't a significant issue for Bitcoin. 
It is a significant issue for how some people want to add L2 networks on top of Bitcoin.
My 2 cents is, this is all cart before the horse. Blocksize increase should have come first, and more than 6 months ago.
@_date: 2016-10-23 21:44:57
Repeat it enough and it will become true. Nice psyops fail.
@_date: 2016-10-17 03:56:59
Stop dividing the community and insulting entire groups of people. You are hurting Bitcoin more than any group when you behave like this.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:35:23
That sounds like a threat.
@_date: 2016-10-17 00:18:23
It appears they uncensored it a few hours ago. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 15:25:35
Interesting that this appears here a day late and only when someone tweets somethings negative.
Bitcoin price shot up yesterday because of this event and shot way up during a presentation about on chain scaling.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:34:23
Higher fees don't make room for more transactions. They kick transactions with lower fees off the bus.
New people cannot use Bitcoin. We need to remove limitations on the block size and let supply/demand dictate the size of blocks and determine pricing.
@_date: 2016-10-23 02:27:10
You are a dishonest scumbag.
@_date: 2016-10-18 04:10:37
Why is speculation about 'industry cooling off' more likely than hard data that proves that the limit is restricting growth?
The 'industry cooling off' isn't the cause, it's a symptom. The data is publicly available. Blocks are full, transactions are expensive and unpredictable, and no one can build businesses on the back of a broken payment network. People are posting about lost transactions and delays constantly. Businesses are moving to ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, or pivoting to "permissioned blockchains".
@_date: 2016-10-18 04:53:06
You joined the project in what, 2012? I don't remember any issues like that beyond database corruption problems unrelated to larger blocks in 2012+. Can you cite some sources? I don't remember this at all and have been paying attention since early 2011.
Regardless, 500k is around 1/3 of what we should be using today to keep the network healthy. We're at capacity and have been for almost a year. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 19:21:48


Here you go again, attempting to divide the community and destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-18 00:30:35
If you are still debating this after six years, you don't have any interest in increasing it at all. 
This type of endless circular debate has convinced me that no limit except miners' soft limits is the way to go.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:11:01
Edit is likely. Why? 
In your own words, "it doesn't really suit their position".
If you don't have a tinfoil hat yet, you really should get one. They are standard safety gear around these parts.
@_date: 2016-10-18 03:09:43
You have no way of proving that at all, and stories of new users with unconfirmed transaction panic posts contradicts your claims. 
All objective data shows BTC has been at capacity since March and has stopped growing. Leaving the limit at 1MB for this year was negligent. Bitcoin should be much more valuable because of growth in real world usage. That's been put on hold indefinitely because of the 1MB limit.
@_date: 2016-10-17 03:59:16
You have you talked to several thousand people individually and assessed their technical acumen to come to this conclusion? 
Stop making sweeping generalizations and making things up. You sound like a bigot and demagogue.
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:53:58
This isn't an rbtc idea. I'm asking for him (or you) to substantiate what he said about 500kb blocks, because I don't remember that being a problem.
I have been involved in Bitcoin for the full year of 2011 through today, and don't remember anything like what Maxwell is saying above.
Separately, have you considered the possibility that the moderation tactics in this subreddit might have something to do with the average account age? I am not specifically commenting on the age of my account, but it sure is an interesting theory. Maybe we should hold a conference about this important topic?
@_date: 2016-10-22 20:31:52
Correct. It is vaporware that doesn't exist.
@_date: 2016-10-19 20:29:23
Is there an echo in here?
We may have to fork, and opinions are not the same on which version of bitcoin is best. 
That said, two things are clear:
1) We should focus our time on the technical and economic merits of each path forward, discuss them openly, and come to consensus from here.
2) Those who make negative or disparaging remarks about people with different views, or make these remarks about entire populations of people (say are the first obstacles we need to overcome in order to have the best outcome for Bitcoin or Bitcoins.
I would posit that those making nasty remarks about BU's developer talent, Roger's fireworks, or Gavin's gullibility are putting their personal power and ambitions ahead of Bitcoin.
They would sooner see Bitcoin destroyed than lose the power struggle.
These are the enemies. You do the math.
