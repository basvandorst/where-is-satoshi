Solid advise for this sub.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:43:09
Fucking solid, easiest strat, no excuse not to do this.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:26:48
Checking it out, looks nice man !

Price returning to certain fib supports/heavy support. When it’s such a spikey ath there isn’t any real support i believe. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:36:01
To be honest it probably is. It might go down towards 4K or some but is that really gonna matter when it’s gonna go towards or beyond 20k again ? 
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:35:47
Wire transfers only at this time i believe.

I thought it costs around 3k to mine a bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:51:37
Im not as doubtful as you are. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:22:50
Because all those you’ve mentioned aren’t really dips
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:50:25
Buy whenever you want, when this baby gonna buff again it’s just a few percent anyway. Not the best advise but better than buying late :D 
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:01:24
"real money" ??  in the bitcoin sub????
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:40:30
See if anycoindirect accepts it, not sure otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:41:14
Why though ? You think 900bil is the max? 
It might take time but I have no doubt it will, none whatsoever.
Just because the price goes up that far doesn’t mean investors are winning. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:33:06
Indeed it’s rather tough to feel out but I think between 4/6k it’s pretty decent. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:25:42
Maybe a stupid question, does the 20% tax still apply every time you buy and sell?

Will bitcoin save Venezuela ? 
@_date: 2019-01-25 22:49:21
For sure, though it should be a nobrainer for businesses and bank in the long run. Just think about the money they can save, liability issues that aren’t relevant anymore, general freedom and not having to rely on third parties. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:35:36
That made my day! Ahahaha 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:17:09
Because it buffed beyond belief not even a year ago. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:18:17
I reckon banks could use it as a backbone, have custody of the keys and that way even offer insurance on it. Just a thought, it’ll take creativity and banks might become a lot different than the traditional ones were used to.

Right ! Hence there’s loads of people believing simpsons is pure illuminati 
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:05:21
The Simpsons have predicted quite some stuff correctly haven’t they :) 
But yes, even more bullish now !

Forget what he says. I’ve mined solacecoin for a while which have given multiple donations. Very early stages though... 
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:24:22
Check Forbes, they also had posted an article about gold. Different bottom line though. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:07:40
Why not ? If he had his keys written down somewhere they can take it without his consent ?
