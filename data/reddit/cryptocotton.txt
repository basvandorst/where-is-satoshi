I took this post as saying not to post Warren Buffett quotes as advise like fearful when others are greedy ect. Buffett comments on Bitcoin are fine but take them with a grain of salt as he doesn't invest in assets he doesn't understand. He's actually probably accurate in broad strokes most cryptos probably will fail, but the ones that stick around will probably be worth alot, but there would be time to exit the puts for a profit within 5 years. Imo he'd lose that bet on ETH, and probably isn't very good money on BTC either  as well as a dozen to two dozen other coins.

can you double check on your work computer history and verify if it was an ad bait?

That doesn't make complete sense you should be asked for 2FA always?

Need to buy zcash or Monero for that and then not pay taxes. Most people are just here for lambos

This would be more appropriate for NEO or ETH

How do you think the attack happened? Did you google search for binance and click an ad? Do you think you work computer has malware and used a keylogger? What company do you work for? Is IT or anyone allowed to see what you are doing on your computer?
