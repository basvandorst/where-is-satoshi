Thank you for this. I just open an account and was about to deposit some money to start trading with them.

Is this the case of grasping at straws?

The problem is not so much with the merchant; he wants to make money, as much as possible in the shortest possible time; nothing wrong with that, we live under a capitalist system where making money is all that matters and ethics will be considered TOMORROW. The problem is the system that allows him to do what he did. I don't think a conventional bank can change 3X the value of the goods as transaction fees. If one does it, the consumer can report that bank /merchant and get some action. Do we have such a protection under bitcoin /cryptocurrencies? It makes one think if this new system is any Good. How would one knows that the merchant is using an intermediary before the bitcoin is taken from one's wallet? I thought CAVEAT EMPTOR was been fased out with laws built in CONSUMER PROTECTION.

You mean, it will be more expensive than the current banking fees? The miners will get more pay than the current bank's CEO's? So, why bother go thru this exercise? Let's stay with fiat currency.

 Why, if in 10 years time, internal combustion engines will be outdated, Ferraris are still so expensive? They should sell for a dime a dozen, who wants them?

Can't get anything from that link. Just a blank page

Does this mean that the transaction fees have to go up to compensate the miners for the loss of revenue?

How come? 16 mil bitcoins are already mined, 5 millions left. At this rate before the end on this decade the 21 millionth bitcoin will be mined.
