Don't waste your time. 449 questions posted, 6,000+ answers and only about half have actually paid out. Browsing through the app i can't help but notice the impressive amount of questions with 40+ answers that even a year later haven't been closed out.

Any, we have users from many of them here, i didn't want to limit to just one.

Competition with well established pools probably, unless you join one.
Along with not knowing what kinds of regulations might be imposed on crypto currencies in the future.

I'm pretty sure at this point, home mining is dead. You're electric bill will eat any tiny profits you might get.
Edit: mining from your pc is dead, not sure how successful a single asic would be.

Definitely. Flexed my fingers over the keyboard to get them ready. Put the oven on preheat for my pizza rolls. All of it

Should be simplest on coinbase i believe they accept visa credit cards and you can link your bank account if you're comfortable with that. You can also google jsibitbot, it runs through several sites that give away free bitcoins (in very small amounts) but for a desktop usee it's more efficient than mining at this point
