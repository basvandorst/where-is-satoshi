Hence my fear of a bubble. They'll be back, and in greater numbers. (after the initial burst)
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:38
Thank you. I'll copy this for future references.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:13:53
Interesting. I'm excited to see what futures trading does to the market.

If you believe in what bitcoin offers, yes. You are one of the first to hear about bitcoin still. Many users here think the word "bitcoin" will be as common as the word "gold." And for good reason.  
If I were you I would wait for it to crash or drop significantly, and then buy.  
Bitcoin is not for the short term, at least now, its for the long term. I don't know what you mean by packages.  
My advice is invest 50% now in case this "bubble" never pops and save the other 50% money for if it does.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:41:51
We're just scratching the surface.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:02:18
Fair enough

You fucking know Roger Ver bought a ton of bcash low and is shilling it for the FOMO bump.  
Bitcoin master race.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:34:15
Are you kidding dude lmao
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:15:53
Google trends gives you an idea
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:31
The layman doesn't know that. A lot of people buying bitcoin are not educated on it. You have to understand how a headline works.  
"BITCOIN RESELLER HACKED - 60M LOST"  It scares people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:20:52
If quantum computers come out bitcoin is fucked.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:25:55
You're not wrong. But if you want bitcoin to succeed it has to be easy. Once I started using coinbase I switched, because I understood things better. But I stand by coinbase being the best way to get new people into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:56:50
What the fuck why? Hodl and get a job
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:09:16
Download coinbase for your phone
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:12:12
I think users will make up for it by selling before xmas when they realize they need the money for gifts.  
Although I understand exactly what you're saying and I think in the long term you're right. But I'm recommending to friends they hold out on buying BTC until the bubble bursts. THEN buying cheap. I'm telling friends to save for BTC now without investing in BTC.  
Edit: Basically long term it's a problem for banks, short term it's a problem for people leveraging credit
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:35:41
And that's why we use green paper to buy more white paper haha
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:18
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:42:11
Because the layman is getting into it

Ask him to convert to cash and then invest what you are willing to lose yourself. If this would be a big sale for you, I would avoid it. If this sale would be a similar amount to what you wanted to invest into bitcoin anyway, I would do that.  
Anything could happen. It's gambling right now. Accept only what you are willing to lose.  
I may get downvoted. Learn about the technology and assess what that means to you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:09:36
 3. Add more shillcoins
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:38:44
Wait. But start saving for it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:35:09
uh no
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:13:08
I think it may. I'd say it tanks to 3k. Then rises to 15/20k faster than anything before.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:32:15
The only reason any money has any worth is because we all agree it has worth. Otherwise a dollar is just a piece of paper. And what good is a little piece of paper?  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:26:59
Congrats man! Smart to keep Hodling. And good on you for convincing your brothers to keep half.  
Christmas is an expensive time of year you can't blame them too much for selling a bit :P
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:43:02
I was wondering how this worked too
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:09:09
Someone was like china banned it and that didn't do shit. I may be very wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:39
Now you're able to buy them the same amount and something else!
It's the thought that counts homie.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:59:39
Your guess is as good as anyone's.  
My prediction would be a steady increase until the week before xmas. Then a drastic dip (30%) From people withdrawing BTC for xmas gifts.  
However, after Christmas you'll see it go back up to 20k/25k. People will talk about it even more than after the thanksgiving spike.  
But I know nothing, just a guess :P
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:30:31
So you recommend using no wallet
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:32:01
Arguments against coinbase:  
It's more risk on top of already risky bitcoin. They are doing an IOU.  
Arguments for coinbase:  
If you don't trust yourself to keep your bitcoin safe it may outweigh the cons. Don't pretend there is zero benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:37:32
Do you have any bithmarks on your ass
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:04:14
Because everyone hodling it thinks it will be the next dollar.  
Its supply is limited so people are cautious about selling. They know that if they sell the price will just go back up.  
I had concerns about a bubble, and I think you will see a small burst around xmas, but nothing like a total crash. It's a different type of currency than anything before.  
BTC isn't like stocks where we see parabolas, I think it's more like a network which follows an S-curve. Meaning it rises and rises until it eventually caps and doesn't go up or down.  
Bitcoin is entirely new territory. Some are more confident than others. We just don't know.  
Finally, if it does crash everyone on this site will quickly jump on the low prices sending it back up again.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:51
Everyone wants everyone to buy on here lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:57:03
Sure but bcash is trash.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:28:01
You're a BTC shill
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:49
I'm so sorry man.
@_date: 2019-03-24 05:52:41
1 BTC bro
