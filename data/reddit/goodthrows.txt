Actually you did. You said it has to be this oddly specific form of hacking. You're reply? Im being too specific.

No im looking at facts and your just dismissing them as abstract. Scammers arent some sort of magical entity that work by magic. There is a very real how and why to this and now your just trying to get off topic.
Also its pretty easy to calculate , look at the number of steps involved and weight it by how hard each step is.

And your saying it was just a coincidence that people are posting about it at the same time frame? Just a coincidence it makes that sound like they were on an automated call list? 
If im following you correctly, you are suggesting that a bunch of scammers got together and said lets make appstore malware that has nothing to do with bitcoin, altcoins or anysort of crypto currency service. But lets build it so it actually does something cause fuck it, it actually has to pass app store inspection and we got to attract some downloads. And after these guys engineed a way to hide the fucking fact that this is malware and we are straight up spying on your browser data, your saying these guys take shifts vigilantly watching the data they've mined and custom tailor a phone scam based each persons browser data as they recieve it?
Well I think we can both agree on the last thing you said

Like how Its so cute how bit coin has a dificulty factor to compare hashing preformance between machines with different hardware? Apparently statistics isnt scientific enough for you.
Also all we know is this:
1. The numbers have been compromised
2. They think the numbers' owners have block chain accounts
The phone scam is a phishing attempt so your jumping to conclusions to assume they have already been phished.

Simpler than just paying a guy for a list of bitcoin users phone numbers?

 Im not one of the guys whining about being called and didnt sign up for most the exchanges I checked out. Im a information security specialist. Scamming is a numbers game so scammers generally go after the largest target audience in their data collection group. I would find it really hard to believe bitcoin users would be the largest group of users in the data collection group of a general nonbitcoin related malware scam. Also the data collection time period for a malware scam is months vs a database injection attack on a website takes a matter of minutes to hours depending on the size of the data base and scope of data targeted. Im not saying it 100% could not have happened the way you described, im just saying its more likely it didnt. 
Also relax,
There is no need to be upset:

So your saying theyre calling them one by one by hand as that data trickles in?
What I was trying to point out was that it take weeks to gather the list of scammed users to make it worth it to carry out the scam. But of course these scammers could be idiots.
Also I was suggesting you were upset because you spent half of last reply berating me based on some false assumption you made about me

a bitcoin site becoming compromised seems alot more likely. Every single bitcoin trading site ive used made me enter a phone number. I dont think you know how malware actually works.
