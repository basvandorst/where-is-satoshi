Set your permalinks and find a new theme/designer. Just some friendly advice.

Yeah, pretty much, they are useful for secure spending if you transfer large amounts frequently. But if you're looking for mainly long term storage solutions such as offline wallets and ability to create secure paper wallets running a rig is the way to go. And of course, you can always perform secure transactions with your rig anyway.

If the 1% want bitcoin, they can have bitcoin. Go ahead.

We've known this.

Because Circle is still in love with fiat.

Offline Electrum or offline generated BIP38 paper wallets. Best options.

They are just playing the game. It's not time for people of power to come out and say "bitcoin" yet. This is why you see them repeat the same tired talking points about anonymity, terrorism and drugs.

I've seen MIT and Princeton bitcoin projects....any projects from real schools though?

There's room for a faster coin and a truly anonymous coin (Litecoin and Monero are the most likely winners at the moment but we are still in the early stage).

You must assume I believe The Bible is the infallible word of God and no human has ever added or removed things based on what they thought should be true or for their own agenda...and everything in it should be taken completely literally, nothing is metaphorical, and no mistakes were made when translated.
You would be wrong in that assumption.
I give you the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas, discovered in 1945

Nothing to do with bitcoin really. @_date: 2015-02-04 06:48:14
I didn't say that at all. There's plenty of truth in The Bible. Most of it actually, but it needs to be read with a spiritual interpretation and not always literally. Yes, there is mistranslated rubbish, but most of it can be correctly interpreted when accurately translated from the original Greek and Hebrew manuscripts. It is also not the only inspired text, and Christianity is not the only religion that contains truth. One must discern for themselves what is truth and what isn't. 
Point is men, not God, decided which text was to be part of what we know today as The Bible.

I was affected by the same exact kind of attack a year ago and lost 2btc. I contacted Coinbase when it happened. I received no love.

Hide valuables inside valuables. Seems legit.

Thank you, I did get in touch.
edit: Actually Michael got in touch with me. I'm still unsure whether or not my situation will be resolved as the recent thefts were (reimbursed).

How do I know God contains the universe and is not just the universe itself? Well, I believe God is everything which includes the universe(s) and you and I. God is all realms. God lies outside of space and time. God is the infinite in a finite universe. God created the laws of physics that created the big bang which created the universe. Therefore, God and the universe cannot simply be the same thing. The Creator cannot be the same as the created.

I believe in God, but not as an old man in the sky. God encompasses the universe and all things. I also don't believe in eternal torment in a place called hell. We are here on earth to learn how to become perfect spiritual being as Jesus was. This can take many lifetimes. When Christ comes back, it will not be as  some person in the clouds, but will come back in spirit through every individual to create heaven on earth. Everyone will know Christ, the Truth, at the end.

Just get one without wifi or hard drive and never connect it to an online computer.
