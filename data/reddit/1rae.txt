One of the important parts is "there is no need to report foreign trade payments made in Bitcoin or digital currency, regardless of how large these amounts are."
In South Africa it's really difficult to move money out of the country, every international payment has to be reported and each person only has a small amount of discretionary allowance (which is undeclared money) that may leave the country. I think it's around £5k a year. Even so it's really difficult to do and I've had to call my bank in order to get international payments done before.
So even for companies it's really difficult for any money to leave the country, it's stuck in South Africa - unless you exchange it for bitcoin and send it to an international exchange.
So it could see growth for that reason.

Thanks, I was trying to find out information about it recently, my bank still doesn't make it that easy to do.

I don't know much about it and what effect its going to have, but I heard the guys from work are having a problem especially since they will still be on holiday Jan 1st. 
Seems like a good reason to switch to bitcoins for online payments but I'm not sure if there are any Nigerian bitcoin exchanges.

It seems like [BitX]( also operates in Nigeria.

Not sure, I was hoping someone could provide more info... I'm sure there are loads of companies that operate in Nigeria that need to travel for business.

It still takes time to transfer from the bank to the bitcoin exchanges...

thanks, earlier I got another error like high S curve or something so I was wondering if something strange was going on.
