Why not have 'coin' be the unit? 'Bit' is already used as unit of information. Coin is unit of wealth.

According to this definition Bitcoin is not fiat.

You're right. But sometimes a little rudeness might be exactly what is needed.

What is your argument?
I've read about societies with real social contracts. Residents would all meet in the city square and swear together to follow the laws of the city. But this is NOT what we're talking about. There is no social contract in modern nation states. You're born into it.

Bitcoin is a computer program, and only humans (so far) engage in politics and advocate ideologies. So Bitcoin is in itself non-political (by definition), but its creator and many early adopters are libertarian.

Well reasoned, sir.
Investing wisely instead of speding mindlessly or merely saving money will increase the capital available to those more capable of inreasing overall wealth in society.
However, saving only would reduce overall wealth disparity (increasing everybody's purchasing power equally). Some are into that.

Social contract, right ...
Care to upload a scan of your contract with the State?
If there WERE such a contract, how would it sound? Something like this:
"I, the State, hereby promise to protect your person and property against foreign and domestic aggression. However, I alone may decide how much you shall pay for my protection services, and you may not choose another protection provider. You may NOT choose to be unprotected. I also reserve the right to change the conditions of this contract at any time I choose, including, but not limited to, protecting you from things you don't want protection against, such as yourself."
Would you sign such a contract?
"failing to pay taxes is unlawful and it's hard to defend that."
And who makes the laws? The very same people who collect taxes.

If the usd/btc and usd/ltc rates become sufficiently independent of each other (I'll have to think about whether or not this is likely), then seasoned bitcoin traders will inevitably prefer litecoins (or some other Bitcoin spinoff), for the same reasons which make the Bitcoin superior to the US dollar.

'bits' are units of information. 'coins' could be units of wealth

Maybe so. In that case, thank you for reminding me. However, I tend to enjoy reading discussions with a few insults thrown about, rather than everybody being nice to each other for the sake of being nice. And what's a little verbal abuse compared of the violent abuse committed by the State and criminals enabled by the State all over the world?

It is easy to construct hypothetical examples where aggression is justified. I can do it too: You fall from a roof, but manage to grab the rail of someone's balcony. Then you are justified in breaking in if nobody's home or the owner won't let you.
But such unlikely lifeboat situations are *rare*.
The theft that is taxation is *systemic*, and does not qualify as exceptional situations. It goes on every single day, all over the world, at a breathtakingly large scale. The legitimacy of taxation is part of the zeitgeist, of public opinion. Most people don't consider taxation theft because the very notion has not occurred to them. In school you learn that your taxes are just your *fair share*. The morality and justice of taxation is never considered.
@_date: 2013-05-25 23:43:25
Maybe it rather *upgrades* the discussion, because people afraid of ridicule will stop and think before they write. Or maybe that's just a rationalization for me behaving rudely. Maybe both. Maybe assholes like me are needed to make good guys like you seem good.

A coherent statement was presented, 'taxation is theft'. You disagree? Then it's your turn: taxation is_______.

"I know it sucks"
So you agree it's a rotten system. In that case, you're suffering from Stockholm Syndrome, aren't you?

It's not a *contribution* if it is coerced. Are you *contributing* to the thief's economy when he steals from you at gunpoint? 
Advocates of taxation care not about fairness or justice; they care about theft and distribution of loot. How is it in any way *fair* that one person confiscates the property of another without consent?

I see.
Just one comment:


Society provides nothing. Individual people provide services. There are only individuals acting and interacting. I advocate that this interaction should be as voluntary as possible. No violence allowed except in self defense against already initiated violence.

Come on, turn on your sarcasm detector. Loosen up a bit, have some humor and take your insults like a man, you pansy.
On second thought, make that a *gallant* pansy; you did after all come to the rescue of the poor victim of my ruthless terrorizing. Or maybe you just wanted to call me a jerk, using too many words.

Empty words. How does an individual "negotiate" at a "societal level"? By voting for some politician every four years? Entrusting decisions a communist party or a military dictator?
How has that been working out so far you think? Two world wars, the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, communism, governments mass murdering their own citizens by the hundreds of millions ... in peacetime!
No. Stop advocating theft and coercion as solutions to complex social issues. Only then can we begin to talk about really solving these difficult and many-layered problems.

You can freely choose leaders for yourself, but you have no right to impose rulers onto others. This is the moral argument.
Historically, taxes fund evil more than any other type of wealth transfer. Wars are funded by forced labor (conscription) and taxes. This is the utilitarian argument.
The greater percentage of his own income an individual is allowed to keep for himself, the greater incentive does he have to be productive and to create wealth. Under any kind of statism, thrift and individual responsibility are discouraged, while sloth and irresponsibility are encouraged. This is the economic argument.

If it were as easy as pointing out that taxation is theft, governments would be widely considered illegitimate long ago.
You're right. I cannot make you agree that my ethics are the right ethics. All I can do is tell you what's on my mind and let you think for yourself.
But the moment I pick up a weapon and threaten to hurt you for disagreeing with me, we're no longer having a rational argument, are we? Non-aggression is a prerequisite for civilized discourse. I respect your right to fund whatever project, gov't or not, you wish. Do you give that same respect to me?

If a thief robs your house and gives it a fresh layer of paint afterwards, does that make the theft okay?
Whether tax money is used for "good" purposes or not is beside the point. You have no right to steal from people, including when you vote for politicians to do the dirty work for you.
If gov't does such a great job with your money, why do they need the underlying threat of physical force to collect it?

The social contract argument has the same fallacy as the concept of original sin. Should you be punished for your parents' misdeeds? Any real social contract would have to be renewed for each new generation.

A thug invades a peaceful neighborhood and establishes himself among them as their ruler and mafia boss.
By your logic the thug has a right to rule, and the residents who don't leave imply consent to being ruled.

I rather think widespread tax avoidance is one of the BEST ways to promote positive change in the world. And that's the threat of Bitcoin. Those who don't want to pay taxes will be able to avoid it. This will either cause everybody else to stop paying also, like a domino effect as fewer and fewer willing tax payers must share a larger and larger bill - or it will force governments to cut savagely in their spending. Either way, we're in for an exciting time as soon as the transition from fiat to crypto takes off for real!

Theft: expropriation without consent.
Taxation: expropriation without consent.
Doesn't matter who does it. Doesn't matter what the stolen property is used for after. Taking stuff from people without their consent is immoral and unnecessary.
If you like taxes, good for you. But you have no right to impose them on anybody else.
