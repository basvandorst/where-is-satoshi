You people couldn't go slower than you already are going if someone had both your hands tied behind your back with blindfolds on.   Stop blaming the delays on "good code and testing".  I have seen entire industries coded faster than you guys have taken to finish Lightning Network.  
Half the problem here isn't that people dont want LN.  Its that its taking so fucking long to get here.  I remember it being announced in 2014 .... and people were hoping to see it by the end of the year.  LOL.  Three years later .........  
Its like you guys have zero concern or awareness of the industry that Bitcoin needs to stay relevant in.

Or ... you know ... Blockstream could just not exist at all and the same Segwit + Sidechains + Lightning could've been made by Core developers as part of simply enhancing Bitcoin.  Rather than as part of an intense conflict of interest. 
Conspiracy theories are coming to play because there's a multimillion dollar corporation with its for-profit fingers dug deep into the direction in which bitcoin goes. 
If you were to tell anyone in 2011 that this would be happening, they would've screamed in horror. 
Bitcoin code being influenced by a centralized company??? with investors who demand ROI???? What kind of crazy insanity is that?  We have become desensitized. 
If there was no such corporation, there would be no conspiracy theory. It would just be arguments with developers about their personal opinions. 
Blockstream is not an imperative part of this equation. It shouldn't be here in the first place.

1) Low value transactions are no longer important to the devs.  Please familiarize yourself with the *new* mentality that Bitcoin is not supposed to be used for commerce. 
2) In general, the people you're speaking to prefer to think about the code and the technology. Not end users. So citing problems based on end-user experience will result in a blank stare. Or apathy / disinterest.

Here's a novel idea. Why don't we support both projects as "bitcoin for different uses" ?

I'm pretty sure none of us would be unhappy with two different coins being worth $2700 each...
Hodl both.

Thank you.   Scenario:  You have all your BTC on paper wallets via bitaddress.org.

Lets assume (I believe it does) Breadwallet acknowledges both forms of Bitcoin.
You import that private key and what .... Breadwallet splits them into two balances and gives you an option to send either one, the other, or both of them separately wherever you want?

Hope someone can correct me if I'm wrong on this, but if they've determined that a quarter of all holdings have already been liquidated, it's doing pretty fucking amazing if you ask me. 
I know you said "way less", but I was expecting something like 2% at this stage.  If we got to that stage in just one week, the liquidation process could be over in a month.
If it continues to trickle, it could very easily maintain 300+ dollars.  And at that point, the only direction is up ... as sellers stop selling.

1). I'm confused.  So basically if you REALLY want to help decentralize Bitcoin and play a role in its power against being shut down, you can't just run a node.  You must also transact.  
2). So basically this means I must hold a bitcoin balance and what - send it out somewhere once in awhile to another address?  And receive sometimes? 
3). Assuming yes - do you have to do this what... once a day for your node to be meaningful?  Once a week?  Once a month?   
4).  Why do you have to transact for your contribution to be meaningful in this context ?
5) does this help speed anything up ?  Confirmation times, transaction speed for others, etc? 
Thanks.

At least Bitcoin Cash wants to keep transactions on an immutable decentralized ledger that has no single point of failure and cannot be shut down.  Because its decentralized.  You know ... the original definition of Bitcoin?

You're kidding right?  Try posting here that you want to buy coffee with Bitcoin and watch what happens.  There is vile, hate-filled, disgusted outrage at the idea that Bitcoin should be used like cash around here.
Regardless of whether the conversation is "on" or "off" chain.  People here mock, belittle, and humiliate anyone who says bitcoin should be used as peer to peer cash here.  
Yes there is another side topic as to where transactions like these should occur.  On chain or off chain.  But that doesn't negate the fact that its the longest running mock-session in this entire sub when people say "Oh go buy coffee with your bitcoin LMAO!!!"  
The simple fact is people here are fucking confused.  On one hand you'll get spat on galore if you imply Bitcoin proper should be used as peer to peer cash.  On the other hand a merchant comes here and says they now accept bitcoin for commerce, and obviously they are not using it OFF chain, yet they get 700 upvotes.

He provided it to Gavin.   He chose not to provide it to you.  Don't confuse "you not getting what you want" .... with being a "fraud".   
I respect anyone who doesn't want to believe simply because he didn't show them personally, or publicly.  What I can't put up with is the absurdly false connection between you not getting what you want, and him "therefore" being a liar.  
This goes against all basic common sense known to mankind.    The two are completely unrelated.  The expectations you created in your own brain do not necessarily pass to Craig as some "obligation" he must follow.   
Also, he didn't "embarrass himself in front of millions" just because you and a bunch of other nerds didn't get what you expected from him.  
Once again I will ask:  *Do you really believe he didn't know how you'd react?*
I'll say it again:  Do you *really* think he's not smart enough to know exactly what the fuck he was doing?

Listen.  Rogers position is a valid one.  And your position is a valid one.  Rogers position means reduced security.  Your position means reduced usability and the complete inability for Bitcoin to be what it was hoped to be.  That's okay.  
If one party were simply "right" and the other wrong, you wouldn't have literally tens of thousands of people disagreeing with you.  You wouldn't have such a longstanding debate going in the first place.  This is indicative of a topic that has valid points on both sides.   
That having been said, my Kingdom for 1 person with the fucking integrity to acknowledge both sides of the argument, acknowledge that Rogers point is valid and his intentions are not malicious - nor are Gregs.  The security concerns may be overstated.  Maybe they're not.   Any great debate becomes a great debate because there isn't 1 simple answer.  There are valid points on both sides.  
What i hate is the childish, mindless shit talking.  Just because he's not on your level technically doesn't mean he should be ignored, or that his points are flat out wrong.  They're not.  
One doesn't have to know how to code to hold a meaningful position on something.  He's not blindly, idiotically wrong.  He just disagrees with your side on how serious the security risks are.  Im not sure if the severity of the security risks are "provable" or (more likely) if they're dependent upon a ton of assumptions (they usually are in situations like this).  
Unlikely assumptions of things that may never come to pass are often at the very root of most debates.  I have a strong feeling they're at the root of this debate too.

Additionally, he has always been irritated by people who hide behind a fake monikers and talk shit about him. 
That has nothing to do with his opinions of anonymity from the Government when it comes to someone's money. 
Very, very basic concept everyone here misses.

Outstanding 100% vague comment that says nothing.

Sounds good.   I stay away from it because I had a wallet.dat file get corrupted on me once back in 2013.  Scared the living hell out of me.  Went full-paper back then.

I have fully confirmed this.

Uh.  He said transactions on the main chain.   There is no stretching whatsoever dude.  Mocking the concept of buying coffee with on chain transactions.  100% accurate assessment.   Nice (not really) try though.

You know why SW was viewed as insufficient as a blocksize increase by those people.  And you know why it was linked. Purely because we were so offensively behind in scaling by the time your team bothered to include a pseudo blocksize increase into SegWit.  
Here's the thing you guys don't seem to grasp:  You ignored everyone, and dismissed their valid concerns for literally years.   I watched you guys do it.  I watched your team tell everyone to "relax".  I watched them mock these folks and call them the "sky is falling" crowd.  
This is why this whole thing played out the way it did.  Not because "Roger blocked SegWit".
Please remember the chronology of events properly.  Rewriting history isn't something "smart" people do.
@_date: 2017-07-15 07:15:29
Isn't it weird that the guy you're responding to thinks you're an idiot who doesn't understand Bitcoin and just wants a Lambo?   
Its really ... really confusing reading people's viewpoints here.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:33:07
It's sad that this concept is the laughing stock of Bitcoin circa 2017. 
Remember when our spokesperson Andreas Antonopoulos had as his mantra:  "Bitcoin.  For other 6 Billion"
Banking the unbanked.  Yes - poor people in Africa being part of a global economy with just a smart phone?
Remember when Bitcoin was, by definition, revolutionary because it "eliminated the need to trust third parties"?
'Member all that?
That was Bitcoin.  ***It was why Bitcoin became what it is today.***  Why people rallied behind it.  
And now you mock those ideas, and laugh.  A lot of people here do. 
Weird.  
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:41:12
Next halving is 2020.  Then 2024.  So yes.  Very realistic.

That's OK. They also keep all the ICO coins that are sent to their wallets mistakenly by users. 
It's incredible to me that we are part of a block chain system like this, and that stuff isn't even refunded. 
Before I knew better I gave my Coinbase ETH address to the Augur ICO.  
Now Coinbase has $1600 of mine and I will never get it back.
No idea if this is accurate but I'm told that the amount of money they just keep due to people making this mistake, is in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:23:15
Hows that chart look if you include the 50% drop in new coin supply happening in June 2020?
@_date: 2017-07-14 06:54:10
Dude, literally the darkest days ever.  You could cut the skepticism and boredom with a knife.  It felt so bleak and dry and boring and empty and lonely.
But now we know how this rolls.  The halvings are the key.   
We are likely going to enter another one of those long cold winters.  It's very possible we're back down to $1500 or $1000 for a long spell.  But come the end of 2020 .... a lot of people here are going to be very, very rich.
And don't even get me started on the end of 2024...

You mean kind of like every single post in this thread? 
I don't see much difference between the two. You both have different viewpoints, and you both act the same way supporting them.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:15:57
sounded like he was mocking the concept of buying coffee on chain, and african people joining a global economy without a trusted 3rd party.   Wait .. yep .. thats exactly what he was mocking.
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:28:54


How is it "holding back progress" ?  Thats ridiculous.  No regular person looks at those articles and gives a rats ass about whether those coins are a "real thing".  
Every single article ever written about Bitcoin says its digital electronic cash.  The worst thing happening here is that Joe Walmart might be thinking:  "I wonder what those tokens are?  Probably just representative"


No it's not.  Literally nobody cares except a few weirdos on this sub.

You've been drinking the punch that's been served around here. Half the reason there's so much drama, is because there's so much BS misinformation. 
Have you ever actually listened to him speak his own opinion on the topic? He has supported SW from the beginning.
Just not without the 2X.
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:17:52
Its relevant to everyone.   Depending what price we're at in Jan 2020, we can expect it to be at least double that 6 to 8 months after the halving in June.   This is the one reliable element that almost guarantees profits for holders.  Assuming demand stays the same or greater.
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:17:10


You must have forgotten to say that part.  You mocked the concept of buying coffee on chain, just like everyone else here does.  And you mocked african people joining a global economy.  You added no qualifications.  
You simply made it sound "stupid" - just like everyone else here does - that Bitcoin might actually do these things for humanity.  
I'm sure you've been here awhile.  Because you're basically just parroting the biggest running joke on - the concept that someone might want to buy coffee with Bitcoin.   
How that became the biggest joke in bitcoin I will never know.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:50:33


Because you hold the viewpoint that aligns with this sub.  As someone who doesn't give a rats ass in either direction, I can confidently tell you that both subs are doing the exact same thing.  Its irritating AF.

I like Bitaddress.org paper wallets.  Printed and put in safe deposit boxes.  Others will recommend hardware wallets (nano / ledger).  I prefer not to rely on anyone else's hardware not breaking. Or software not corrupting. Paper wallets I can only blame myself if something goes wrong.

That most people are irrational, rude, biased, one-sided, and intolerant of other viewpoints if it suits them financially or emotionally.  And this goes for people on both sides of any debate.  Whether its bitcoin maximalists (still) saying ethereum is a scam, or the debate between BU and SW.  etc etc etc.  Pick a topic.  Almost always true.

This is because they are not permitted to post here under their original accounts.  They had been removed due to that viewpoint in the first place. 
There is no logical reason someone would need to make a new user name to promote that viewpoint.

This guy gets it.  Unlike most.  
The greatest part is they sat and watched SW go nowhere.   For months. Utter failure in adoption. Zero. Zilch. 
Now they're seeing everyone agree to move forward. Why?  Because of on-chain scaling.  ***Only*** because on-chain scaling is included. 
And yet here they sit. Laughing like monkeys as if they've called the shots from the start. People are strange. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:39:29
And after just 2024 the rate of new coins is going to drop so low that it will be almost negligible.  So effectively, very soon, upwards price pressure will be staggering.

It's not that he doesn't understand what a fork is.  It's that he's biased, human, and petty, so he's saying snarky shit in favor of his "team" that makes no rational sense ... because ... humans.

Dozens?  I've been in the space since early 2012 and I haven't met a single person who thinks that.
Here's the even funnier part.
Dozens = 72-ish people?  That's a whole lotta people.  Assuming they were a small percent of people you've spoken to about this, Ill give you 10%.  
So you ***just happened*** to get into ***this specific conversation*** about physical bitcoins on the top of bitcoin articles with over 700 people?
Fascinating load of BS :)
You've met nobody.    You're just being contrary.

Grammatical train wreck.  What?  
The guy you're responding to hit the nail on the head.  
The point is, if anyone came forward with "evidence" now, none of you would believe it anymore.  That was his goal. 
Ever heard of hiding in plain sight?  
You have all rallied yourself into such a frenzy demanding signatures and movement of Genesis block, that you will ignore anything else that comes out. 
So the people that were extorting him with threats of exposing him, can now do absolutely nothing that would convince anyone.

Are you parroting something someone told you?  He was always in support of SegWit.  From Day 1.  He was opposed to SegWit without some sort of on-chain scaling included.  Half the reason this topic has become so shitty and toxic is because folks like yourself parrot false information, and lazy people don't bother to verify it.
