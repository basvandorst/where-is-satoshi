Hint: Bitcoin's ledger is public:

40% of bitcoins are owned by 1000 people, not sure about being the most decentralised.

I hope you're right. I want Bitcoin to do well just as much as everyone but there's no denying there are things needing fixing.

$130 before or after the dip?

I had a similar issue and mine confirmed in 2-3 days. Apparently blocks are clearing faster now so maybe give it a little longer. 
Otherwise you can look at using a transaction accelerator to change the fee.

How'd you go?

It's been consistently shit

It's been a day for me and my transaction hasn't been confirmed. Reading the comments below I think my wallet charged a low fee even though I picked 'fast confirmation'. Is there a way I can resend the transaction with a higher fee?
1.0252 BTC sent and fee was 0.0000223
or $4473 and $0.10 fee
Wallet Used: Ledger Nano S

I had a similar issue with my NEO's locked up and it took 3 weeks of their painfully slow customer service before my account was unlocked.
First thing I did after that experience was remove everything I had off the exchange.

Nah they would just use Montero
