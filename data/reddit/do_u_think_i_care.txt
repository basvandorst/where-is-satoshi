Their main programmer worked 40 hours this week, and his wife even cancelled her trip to Monaco.  Don't stress them out!

Wrong, government is at war with civilians regaining any sort of power that is not controlled by governments/companies being controlled aka banks.

make sure you query the finex address you sent the coins to, not the address you sent them from.

You stored 240 btc on bitfinex?  not trying to be a dick but i'm going to be - wtf dude?

The media is just 20 year women making suggested based on 20 year old bitcoin kid comments on reddit.
The entire media is a joke.  
The bitcoin traders/users are a joke (mostly).
It's very entertaining to watch plebs, geezers, kids, and housewives trade crypto.

Sounds like a lot of places to keep track of.

My aunt is a bullshit detector, and she says this thread smells like sweet sweet bullshit.

How is it hard to believe?  This was probably planned for a month.  Hackers can be in the system for a while with nobody noticing.  This is why companies run tenable scans and have SIEMs watching.  Not sure if bitfinex had that level of operations, but only time will tell.

Let's all just repeat exactly what is being said in multiple threads.  YEAH!
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:18:07
Pretty much this.
As great as it is to share info, they are digging themselves in to a deep hole.
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:01:39
Hahahaha... you had everything on bitfinex? wtf dude?

BFX tokens = Bullshit Fucking Xchange tokens that mean nothing.  It'll be a token that is just meaningless.... designed to stop the lawsuits.

check the wallet that received the bitcoin.

Security shitshow?  Welcome to the Bitcoin Industry, you're hired.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:09:52
So far it sounds like a joke.  Tokens.. lol.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:44:22
The kid doesn't sound more than 20 years old.  Using words like "Shit" "peace out".  This is why you don't hire millennials to be the voice of your company.
This is also a classic case to show why you don't say shit until multiple people have reviewed your direct response.  They are tearing this child apart.  
I get it - they want to be transparent and "cool".  But there is a reason companies aren't transparent and cool... they are going to get ripped apart by lawyers with all the things they are saying.. so many mistakes.

The things zanetackett has said is more than enough for lawyers to go to town with.  The only way bitfinex is going to get away from that is by saying zanetackett is jsut the janitor... we didn't authorize him to speak on our behalf.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:22:43
I love when 20 year olds give advice.  It ends up sounding like this.
Quite entertaining.

I had less than a bitcoin.  I got out of the industry many years ago.  Way too volatile, even though I love the technology.  Not going to sue.  Not worth my time.

The funny thing about hearsay is that is it almost always hearsay 80% of the time, mostly.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:03:47
This is true.  I am dumbfounded that the kid before you rephrased the question completely differently.  I guess bitcoin traders were never the sharpest tool in the drawer.

Crypto is considered a property, not a currency.  Maximum property loss per year is $3000.  Good luck.
