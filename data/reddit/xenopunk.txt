Yeah exactly. If bitcoin was actually used as a currency as people here desire there is no earthly way that its value would be that high. The reason its value is so high is **because** of investors if you removed all the speculators from the pool then bitcoins value would be like $1000 max and that might be reaching. If you really want bitcoin to take over then you need it to be massively more stable or much lower cost or else its never going to happen.

Academically investing is viewed as gambling, you can alter your odds by being clever but for every profitable smart investor there is a smart investor losing money. Everyone thinks they are invincible till it happens to them, we only really hear from the successful ones.

Short answer: Prices tend to climb much slower than they drop.
Long Answer: its linked to confidence in reward. You can lose confidence easily but to gain it tends to take a long time, the price rise earlier was due to quickly increasing prices, you look at the graphs from August to November and you can see why an investor might jump on the rise, they had confidence it was going to go higher. At the moment there is no reason as to why it would suddenly surge back upwards, no reason to have any confidence in it as an investment at all to be truthful.
Most likely this is a correction we will see many investors drop out once it closes at under 10k, I would say it might go to about 6k but could go lower. You have to appreciate at the same time that when you look at the full history of bitcoin, this price is an anomaly there is no necessary reason as to why it should be and will return to this high.

Sure but any entry level analyst will tell you that if it behaves like any other stock its likely to get lower judging the current trend.

Ah I should have researched this further, thanks for correcting me. Bitpay/Coinbase must be laughing all the way to the bank.

Faster even, I am expecting to wake up one of these days and see everyone crying over it.

It needs to be stable before Amazon will start accepting it, what happens when you buy something in bitcoin and then want to return it 2 weeks later when BTC is now worth 2x as much, do they return your exact bitcoins or a number representing the dollar value when you bought the item. 
What about if BTC drops soon as you have bought something, now Amazon has way undersold one of their items. The infinite growth and instability of Bitcoin ruin its viability as a real currency, at least without constantly considering its value relative to USD.

Don't quite know how coinbase works but if it's 1% both ways then the profit is about $150 instead of the $350 you might expect.

Yeah, if you really want crypto to be the future stop focusing on its value against the dollar. Betrays your true intention.

It will go further, pretty certain of that. If you are buying the dip as a way of making money please make sure you are willing to be in this for the long run.

Some sense in this sub finally,  sell high buy low, hodl is not an investment strategy if you are here to make money then do the smart thing.
