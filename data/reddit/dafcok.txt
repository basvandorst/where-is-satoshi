Udpated idea: instead of just spamming him with crap, a catalogue of models offered to him shall be collected at first. Dorian can then pick what he likes.

Bitcoin even disrupts badly written TV soap operas. This beats them in any aspect.
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:48:38
no worries, he will loose them again.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:58:08


So you have found that out, huh? Congratulations. Believe me, it's easy in fiat world to reveal who received the payments and as every withdrawal was governed by Gox staff, the misappropriation had to happen there.
@_date: 2014-03-06 10:45:30
about being gagged and detained
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:42:12
They didn't account for, respectively omit liabilities of btc.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:58:09
since the site is obviously down, how you got notified of the processing? e-mail?
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:38:59
From the minds of virtually any stakeholder it's safe to say that a clear cut description of the incidents and thorough investigation is due. Be it depositors, traders, future btc businesses or law abiding authorities. Why the heck there is no detailed account on all these things yet? How can any organization and/or human be that locked up?
If holding back the big coming out wasn't already gross enough, consider the deception and lies which pulled so many into this misery... I still cling onto this very statement from support, issued to me on the 19th of february after 3 months of administrative harassment:
"On checking further, your withdrawal has been listed under the queue and it will get processed soon."
No way to believe the order of magnitude of misinformation and  malevolence.

Another idea: 3D print them with going all open source. Adds aesthetic value as well.
@_date: 2014-05-18 16:52:51
chicken or egg, which is first? somewhere, someone has to start.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:10:28
withdrawals were supposedly not automated... but hey, you never know how stupid people can be: withdrawing 50000$ from Tom Kelley to a Russian account of Mr. Vovkarichiv

Goldman scrutinized transaction costs of btc and credit card payments.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:00:45
yes, they even compressed bitcoins significantly: down to zero.
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:49:04
maybe a concerted collusion of the upper echelons's of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:58:57
please elaborate more when you continue browsing the data.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:55:42
'+ who leaked that?
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:05:40
Just acknowledging and not stealing it would be a good start already.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:02:37
Same here.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:56:07
But how we know this database entries are status quo and in sync with real state of accounts??
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:18:34
ever heard of oldtimers, vintage synths and related hobbies? they collect for reasons apparently not fathomed by you.
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:02:14
I forgot to mention: removed/reduced it with great foresight the moment their regime against freedom got even worse. So you might add smart to your conjecture.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:06:11
can you somehow describe the characteristics of the "strange pattern". upon which aspect are they strange?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:06:47
I expect the lawyer will tell him to not disclose anything and keep silent... bingo! (+goxxed)
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:37:15
MK won't loose them again, will he? Would be quite 'inconvenient'.
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:35:34
"Gox executives will not be rewarded with bonuses paid by bitcoin inflation and taxation."
He is wrong on that. Price went down (taxation) and bonus is sacked by our beloved hobbit in disguise and chief executive officer Karpeles.

miners that include the transaction into their PoW block
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:20:46
withdrawals in progress are not accounted for, i.e. fiat accounts in the DB show the already deducted amount despite not being processed. (sample size = 2 customers).
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:30:50
Mt Gox unveils new blockchain compression technology: size goes down from 16GB to 0.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:16:15
That, I didn't rule out and is a nice suggestion. Maybe we should collect a catalogue beforehand and then he can choose to his likings.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:52:04
also, one could see that after halting bitcoin withdrawals some stopped getting used and some continued. those continued ones should lead down the rabbit hole afai understand.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:43:06
They (= corrupted, inefficient, self-serving, autistic, non-accountable banks) should prepare to retire. Shall those "high transaction costs" be their last pension payment.

Every history needs its landmarks. On that term, building the Eiffel tower was retarded as well... Well maybe it was.

Apple will be removed by her own repeated and implied request to do so from the surface of this world.

you've had your fair chance to spread hopium... now wasted

Guys, just fix asymmetric information for accounting.. Project ACTUS and such.
