Holyshit this is dumb.  Lengary trader predicted the bear market with the post "i want to re-enter in 2016-2017"
My god you guessed there would be a good entry point within a 700+ day span and you were right.  Wow a real prophet!  You even projected words into his disposition of when next he would like to buy like "prediction and bear market". Jesus.
This reminds me of george carlins weather man ultimate forecast... the weather will continue to change!
Also, it is overlooking all the other tweets he made that are less accurate.
I can make 10 accounts make 10 incredibly specific predictions and use a technique called magicians choice and be considered "god" status from
The viewpoint of this journalist.
That said... 15k btc this year. Yeah why not.

I know exactly how easy and hard that is to predict.  I have been charting and trading stocks and bitcoin for a decade.   I have better and more specific predictions  than this guy.  I also have plenty of predictions that didn't come true.  This was an incredibly unspecific prediction.  There are so many scenarios where it could be a "good prediction".   
Go to a charting website and you'll see people making much more specific predictions and being accurate this guy isn't special and neither was his prediction.   Where is my bias?  From experiencing much better predictions?  Fair enough

I know that is the typical arbitrage.  but I found an arbitrage opportunity locally.
