I more meant buying/selling coins, not so much businesses that accept them. That's an awesome idea for a sub though. I'll be subbing

In all seriousness, and please excuse my ignorance on the subject, what legal grounding do the people saying they will get lawyers actually have? I get that something was stolen, but are any of these bitcoin exchanges required to or have to be insured like banks? I understand it would be social suicide to not reimburse those who had their coins stolen, but could LocalBitcoins ACTUALLY be sued for this?

That reliance brought security though. People TRUSTED Silk Road. Gonna be hard to just get that back.

I'd imagine something just like the regular BBB. Search, rate, and read reviews. If it got large enough, with enough support, it might be able to request the companies to respond to claims.

It would have just been the cost of gas that made it above cost value. I just want a way to make a few bitcoins without making the actual investment in them directly. I don't see the price dropping to $4 anytime soon so I'm not to concerned about just holding onto the coins themselves.

Ah, I was under the impression he was using those leaked documents. Can't fully get what's going on in them.

Ah, well can't beat that. They are buying direct sooo guess that's what I get for hoping on the train late.

Did he? Do you have s counter or clarification argument? I don't mean that to sound rude, I'm honestly confused on the whole situation.

To be fair, there is s list 1000 times as long of ideas that people said would have no choice but to be successful.

I ask you please ignore my ignorance on the subject, but why are there miner fees for transferring bitcoins between wallets? I mean, if you're a miner I get it, bit outside of that I'm a bit lost.

Fantastic! Can't wait to see it!

It seems like an ideology then. Like communism, it's perfect on paper, but practice seems a bit, unrealistic. How could it be realistically achieved and maintained without some central authority?
@_date: 2013-10-19 00:40:55
I would agree not anymore. But in full honesty, I never knew about Bitcoin until I discovered Silk Road, and my only reason for going there was learning about the underground drug markets. It was fascinating to me. I will not make any claim that "the majority" of first time learners early on in Bitcoin discovered it that way, because I can't prove it. But my initial understanding of it, prior to doing more research primary done because of this subreddit and other sources, as simply a way to use a commodity to buy illegal things.
I never imagined that it would grow like it has, and frankly I'm happy it has. I'm happy that my initial thoughts were wrong. Not happy I didn't buy in to it sooner, but that's a personal woe.
Never was is a hard statement to make though in my mind, primarily because I never saw it outside of TOR until I got bored a few months later and decided to look into it more. The early information confused me, and I didn't quite understand why something you couldn't hold could have dollar values associated with it (I'll admit I didn't think much about fiat currency either in that regard).
That went off on an unnecessary tangent, but basically I agree it's not mostly crime anymore, but I think Silk Road greatly aided in it, just as the fall of Silk Road will (and apparently has) as well.

North Carolina makes me sad...I need to convince my higher ups to at least test this process out.

Government, in some form of another, will always exist. Humans understand that they have reliance on each other, and eventually someone will have control over it. Someone must organize the police, someone must organize the road maintenance, someone must ensure that water is always available to all those in need and that there are standards for medicine, someone must make the laws. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 00:14:09
Isn't that the definition of currency though? No one would use the dollar if they didn't think it was worth trading with. I don't agree that it would limit it's potential, but the rest seems about right with any currency isn't it?

The fair market value is the price at which the property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts. United States v. Cartwright, 411 U. S. 546, 93 S. Ct. 1713, 1716-17, 36 L. Ed. 2d 528, 73-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 12,926 (1973) (quoting from U.S. Treasury regulations relating to Federal estate taxes, at 26 C.F.R. sec. 20.2031-1(b)).
Nothing says it can't change over time. Just that, with current conditions, it is the highest a reasonable buyer is willing to pay and a seller not be burned or short changed.

Ah alright. So I don't get in the same situation as the last comment, is this what those leaked documents were saying? I was pretty lost by the whole thing.
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:01:27
Like with all tax dollars, does the expenditure benefit me is the big question. Do I want a centralized police force and fire department? Yes I'd put money at it. We have seen in the past how having public services in private hands with competing markets can be bad in the past with individual, privately paid for fire departments. Do I want want a set standard around the city for water and waste? Yes I'd pay taxes for that. Do I think we might need one particular thing done that I don't agree with, no, but if my money paid for that one thing and all the other things that I want, then yes, I would.

So your saying that this period is really just a rinse and repeat of history? This was my bigger concern I suppose. which I admit I probably could have phrased better.

It looks like it's not based any statistics, simply off people putting down who they think will win off of either personal research, guessing, or picking favorites. Is that right?

A more evenly distributed tax system, based on what people can afford, and what they make, is much better than one object that someone owns. A land based tax system would seem more harmful to the farming class than be a benefit for federal taxes. Besides, the more income a government can make from higher incomes can allow for said government to give to all of it's citizens.

That's an interesting part of history I've never been aware of. Mind PMing me so we can discuss this more? I'm passing out (EST) and would love to hear and discuss more about anarchism in general with you without diverging to far from the topic at hand in this particular thread.

Unless it was under the table I'd doubt it. Sales tax would have to be there unless s car just "vanished" ( have to explain that revenue though) and then there are title fees, so the state knows you have it, and then on from there.

I'd assume it comes from general faith in longer term stable growth and losses giving a good chunk of currencies a healthy medium. If you look at the value of bitcoins prior to the first recession in value, and then the value afterwards, if it hadn't spiked and dropped, it was a steady growth, attempting to find a comfortable medium trying to find a stable market value.
Could regular currency crash like it has before in heavy depressions (US's Great Depression is the best example)? Absolutely, but before that happened, there was a spike in the standard of living and the value of the dollar that was abnormal and not steady.
I'd be willing to put money down on the fact that the market value will drop again (for most people's sake not as rapidly as this has grown) and get roughly to the point where it would have been continued growth at a steady rate and to a happy medium of increase/decrease that forms a "roughly common value".

Yes, and it's an unrealistic political theory. In some way or form, someone will be in control, and it will be a consensus of some group of people. Once someone organizes action, then the fibers of government begin.

From what I've understood, anarchism would, in an ideal world, rely on cooperation between all parties for the betterment of everyone involved.
