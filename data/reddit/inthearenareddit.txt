Thanks - link here for everyone's reference. 
Still I would have thought this would be a priority after August 2017. Seems strange that we are expecting others to adopt it before Bitcoin Core does.
Perhaps this whole thread would be better focused on getting coders to help out on completing that Segwit Pull Request? One win at a time - especially if the likes of Gemini are using the fact that Core is yet to adopt it as an excuse.

Ft has a paywall - you've probably exceeded the article count.
He basically says he regrets making the comment given the attention he received. He doesn't say he believes in Bitcoin. He does say the standard wall street line about block chain and the technology behind bitcoin is powerful and that ICOs need scrutiny.

Amazing - a beautiful way to visualize the power of decentralized collaboration.

You should post this on r/cryptocurrency. Somehow the group got bored of btc and started chasing whitepaper promises.

Yes. With fees it's unusable. Will be great with Lightning when it's available though - you could tip cents if you wanted to.

Bitcoin is a community as much as it is an investment. All communities have their own sayings and rituals.
Hodl might not mean much to you but for those that held long term despite heaps of doubt, i.e. when it decreased from $1102 In Nov 13 to $192 in Jan 15, it means a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:41:47
Welcome to the community. We all experience it together and have different visions on what it will become.
That's what makes it amazing. You now own part of the project and will participate in many of its future directions  (i.e. forks).
Don't give up on it. Get involved. If transaction fees &amp; speed are your focus jump right into the scaling debate. Research. Debate. Experiment with it. It ours!
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:14:58
It's not too early - the first Lightning protocol has been developed and some transactions have already gone through the mainnet (with Lightning, you open and close a channel using Bitcoin's mainnet and the channel itself is really just an agreement between parties to square up the final balance at a later time). 
So to answer your question, yes there are a few wallets that are being developed. Unfortunately it's not recommended we use these on the mainnet yet as they are still ironing out some of the bugs with lightning and all the companies and individuals involved are prioritizing security b/c it involves people's money (no rushed development). 
You can check out the lightning thread: 
Keep an eye on the thread as the development is actually happening pretty quickly.

Even though they are cash settled traders may own the "physical" (I guess digital here...) to hedge their position. 
If I went short at $10k and the price rose to $12, the best way to limit further losses would be to buy and hold Bitcoin. That way if it goes to $20k my net loss is still only $2k instead of $10k (because I made $8k holding Bitcoin).
It's possible that the traders dump their Bitcoin on liquidation because they no longer need it as a hedge.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:16:57
If you shorted Bitcoin on the futures and the price keeps going up, the best way to limit your losses is to buy Bitcoin. This covers your position so you avoid more losses.
When the future contract expires,, or the price of btc goes down, you no longer need the hedge so you could dump the bitcoin you bought.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:54:27
Sorry - reckless, playing off the reference in the tweet that's linked (if you click on it, it says confirmation: instant, fee: nothing, testnet: never,  yup)
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:13:35
Good point. I guess you would take the cheaper option. Sometimes that might be buying btc. 
Holding BTC has other benefits as a hedge. It gives you optionality to arb or hold beyond the contract date. Dumping btc also puts downward pressure on the price so if you have a large hold you retain the option to sell before the contract expiry in hope of moving market.
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:37:00
Lightning has started! We've seen a few "reckless" main net transaction, next a "reckless" wallet. I'm game!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:08:27
The existing technology is priced in. We are waiting for btc to deliver lightning or altcoins to live up to their whitepaper promises.
Let's give them some time - lightning is much closer than most people think and there are heaps of Dapps in the pipeline.

Thank you. An appropriate article to reference.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:07:14
Even though this post is intended to reassure people I think it just creates FUD.
The article is from early December.
This creates uncertainty because people now have to verify if there were changes in the government's stance since December. And yes, there were relevant announcements that are not mentioned here. So a newbie is uncertain and confused - more research is required.
If you mean to argue nothing has changed since December, please do so. Pinning an old article is a little lazy.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:58:30
I think that's just the record of wallets.
Apparently the wallets are fully generated at random. There is no system to check if the address is already being used... Conceptually it is possible that two people generate the same wallet address! Weird but the probability of that happening is said to be extremely low.
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:55:53
I think you should set your rules in advance.
When you buy iota decide what price you sell if it goes down, price you sell it it goes up and/or how long you hold for.
Selling when prices goes down makes sense if you're initial investment thesis has changed or you need to risk mitigate (i.e. you might be over invested). I

Although with a 40 cent transaction fee it would be very silly. That's at low chain congestion too.
I wish people understood BCH before shilling it as the panacea for scaling limitations.

Anyone know the progress of Coinbase's batching implementation? How long do you think this will this take?

Bitcoin Core doesn't even support it yet in the GUI... crazy.
Apparently Gemini is waiting on Bitcoin Core before they activate. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:55:11
Check out the futures price for guidance on market expectations.
I can shill you my view (buy with knowledge that it's gambling but understanding that BTC is well placed to emerge as a global digital currency and wealth management ecosystem - so timing your market entry at this early stage is insignificant if you hold long term) but you shouldn't trust me as an anonymous reddit handle anyway ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:40:09
I'm a supporter of Bitcoin Core - but it seems a little stubborn to reject a 2MB block and then to stall the GUI upgrade for Segwit... I really hope this is a priority for them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:47:56
+1 for reading the whitepaper. I reckon you now know more than 80% of the "investors"! Keep it up, it's an awesome space and knowing the technology helps you to avoid the FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:19:12
In simple terms, we both set aside money to use on lightning and we agree to settle the balance between us at a later date. 
Only the first and last transaction goes through the Bitcoin Blockchain (the setting aside and closing out), all the stuff in the middle is just us changing the final balance of who owes who.
It's a bit like opening a tab at a bar.
Because we set aside the money in the beginning, I don't need to worry whether you can afford to pay me.

I can't believe they claim bitcoin is dominated by corporate interests when they literally advertise themselves on this reddit, own bitcoin.com, have the largest ASIC manufacturer behind them, admit to overloading the btc mempool with low fee transactions and pay "birds" to retweet pro bch tweets.

Running a LN node is not that hard. I have one open now on my macbook.
I think you're right (you need to send 1 BTC via channels with at least 1 BTC staked). I don't see this as a problem - if you're sending large sums of money you are probably more likely to send it on-chain rather through the Lightning Network. LN is sort of like Venmo, you set aside money to make quick transactional payments.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:50:17
Apparently it's the number of wallets with at least 1 satoshi. I recall looking into this too.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:43:49
So the 22m wallet count on blockchain.info doesn't represent the total number of users? I.e. it doesn't include coinbase users?

Will need to read the report.
Bitcoin.com is explicitly biased towards bitcoin cash and the article focuses on the scaling debate. Suggest you form your own conclusion on the report without influence from the website.

Yes i agree with the view but not the way it was presented in the post. It causes more confusion and most ppl would assume it's a recent headline.

In non-price based news... Blockstream has opened it's store for bug-testing payments on the Lightning Network.... pretty big deal (although controversial as it's not mainnet ready).

What region are you after? Gemini and Gdax are both US. 
Update: just use this 
Also your issue was probably through ACH connection to HSBC. Presumably you could wire transfer if you can't do ach. That's a us thing though
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:18:37
Coinbase is horrible - customer service is slow, fees are high and there are questions on the management of the bitcoin cash issue. 
Gemini is much much better. If you are dead set on Coinbase, at least use Gdax (same company, same login, substantially lower fees).
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:32:30
I'm not sure because exchanges don't give you control of the private addresses.
Does that mean there are less than 22 million bitcoin users?

Awesome thanks for sharing
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:06:15
Does anyone know if the blockexplorer wallet count (now ~22million) includes the accounts with exchanges  (Gdax, Gemini, Coinbase etc)? It seems low
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:49:01
I'm not sure if those going long were equally incentivised to hold btc as those going short...
When Bitcoin rose to 20k, it might have forced a lot of the shorts to buy btc as a hedge (an alternative to selling their contract). Then before contract expiry they might have chosen to dump in an attempt to drive price down - makes sense as they no longer need the hedge as BTC already fell from it's highs.
Those who went long had less of an incentive to buy btc (yes they could attempt to drive up prices but it's costly and risky given the market depth). 
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:58:46
Awesome - this means the pull request is complete and Bitcoin Core will support Segwit in GUI?
How long will it be until it's rolled out?
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:10:43
Can we add this to the wallets in the post? Bitcoin Core should be included. I guess it's "ready"
Update: Sorry no need, I see the status only applies to exchanges

Have you guys seen this? This will generate heaps of confusion
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:04:41
It's hard because they are all correlated for the most part (i.e. move in same direction).
Staying with the major coins is theoretically safer because they have a longer track record, more liquidity, better dev community and more support.
If you do venture off to altcoins look for ones with a good use case (i.e. Waltonchain) or strong and growing platform (Neo).
Everyone will shill you their coins and most of them bought their coins because of a shill... a momentum trade that can only go so far and when it stops it reverses dramatically. So be very careful and make sure you do your own research (30 minutes as an absolute minimum, ideally a lot more, even if you only bet a small amount).

When I use the simple math to calculate the maximum number of transactions Bitcoin Cash can do a year, I quickly realised that 8MB isn't a solution to the scaling problem. 
A typical transaction is 250 bytes. The block size required for a global currency  (say 7bn ppl with 2 transactions are year) is 24GBs!
I have no idea why Bitcoin Cash supporters are so loyal to Roger Ver  (Google his endorsement of My Gox). I can only assume they misguidedly think that 8MBs is a solution and they believe the BS about Core being deceived by private companies.

If anyone is interested in considering Stiglitz's credibility beyond his nobel prize they need only Google his report on Freddie Mae, paid for by Freddie Mae, where he concludes there is almost zero risk or cost of a GSE insolvency to the government.
As Hayek said, Economics should not have a nobel prize because it gives the winner too much influence on non-experts (politicians, journalists etc).
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:56:30
I agree but i do at the same time find Bcash threatening. It has powerful shills: Bitcoin.com and a high profile Ambassodar that is very vocal (with a strong PR agency and support from CNBC). Not to mention pre-August holders own it so have an incentive to support.
I don't own it in volume (I dumped it) - but I was very nervous this week. Newbies don't understand it and Andreas, Core and LN management don't speak to newbies as effectively as Roger's attacks on CNBC.
There's a lot of pressure on Lightning. Core's decision not to support 2MBs does seem a little stubborn in hindsight. Especially if LN takes more than 3 months

Has Gemini enabled Segwit? It says "ready" - so why not active?

Thanks Mothypap.
Can you help explain what utxo is and how it is linked to segwit? I hadn't heard of it until now
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:14:13
Wow thanks MothyPap. That's a helpful link and I was unaware of the issue.
"UTXOs, are the change that’s left after sending a bitcoin payment. Wallet providers are supposed to sweep these crumbs up and bundle them in with future transactions. Coinbase, it transpires, has been hoarding its, creating an expensive digital mess, and raising questions as to its readiness to implement scaling solutions."
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:10:43
I do. It's cool. You scan a QR code on your phone, enter the amount and press send. Super smooth. I literally just bought dinner at a restaurant in BTC.
Credit cards are similar but the process is messy. The merchant brings out a bespoke device (which is costly), they swipe your card (all your details are public), the merchant waits for the machine to do what it does, it prints a paper receipt, you sign with a signature that no one checks, you write the tip on paper etc.
Of course BTC fees are high but that will hopefully be resolved with lightning. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:06:25
I agree man. If you have a bank account, credit card, iPhone and live in the USA - life is pretty good when it comes to payment options. Venmo is awesome too. 
I would like to say Bitcoin helps all the others who aren't as lucky but it doesn't yet - the fees are too high (I expect and hope this will be resolved soon).
It does still trump Apple Pay and all forms of payment when it involves cross border transfers though. 
Your point about having no motivation to convert from USD to BTC to make payments is fair.  If the price stopped increasing - not many people would accept the volatility. 
Time will tell. I'm enthusiastic about it and acknowledge it's still a gamble despite all its power.

If you think the price is the most interesting thing about bitcoin - sell.
If you think there is value in a decentralized immutable ledger, and you want to support the concept regardless of the potential loss - hold.
If you're addicted to checking this reddit: put your funds on a hardware wallet. Sign up to a developer chat or an enthusiast meetup - focus on more than price. You'd be amazed at the development that is happening and the potential of the technology (at least I am).
Ignore all references to FUD, Whales, Technical Analysis (it's bogus), Pumps and Dumps, Buy the Dip etc.

To a massive hedge fund or investment fund - 400m isn't a huge amount, especially if it's divided across multiple investors or sub-funds.
I was at a GS tech investor conference last week and there was a huge amount of interest in crypto and the speakers were all relatively positive.
My guess is we will see these amounts trade more often now Insto money is coming in.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:12:21
That's my point. They should sell if they can't afford the loss. It could go either way. Leave the gains to those that believe and can afford the risk

Yep - definitely. While positive, it doesn't mean that much though - Bitcoin does 10 billion a day in volume so the inst money helps but isn't a game changer and in terms of credibility, their hunch is no better than yours. 
The most positive thing about it is how it 'normalizes' bitcoin as a financial asset.

The investment view acknowledges that it's in its infancy as a currency and they are holding on the belief that it would be substantially more valuable when its adopted like a currency.
March-17 only up to 5.8 million users.
Still no more than ~24 million 
My anecdotal reasons for thinking adoption is increasing exponentially:
* I recently paid for dinner using bitcoin (
* Arizona Senate just passed a bill to accept bitcoin (
* Many stores have started accepting it (
* Most countries have specific bills that legalize bitcoin (
* The number of exchanges has increased significantly (
* The number of bitcoin ATMs is increasing exponentially ( etc.

Google Bitcoin Discussion with an old year, say 2014, 2015 or 2016. Read the comments and assess their thought process at the time...
You either buy because you believe (while acknowledging it's akin to gambling risk) or you sell because you don't believe. 
Try to time the market and you'll never pick the signal from the noise. You'll end up buying when everyone's buying or selling because everyone's selling.

A sensible comment drowned in a sea of chartists, whales, sell wall etc commentary.

Most traders in banks have access to the bank's customer buy and sell orders. So they have opportunities to create a market (trading the bid ask spread) and they get a sense of the short term market direction from the orders (like looking at buy and sell walls that are reliable/not manipulated). 
Technical analysis is subjective just as you mention - they might think they are using technical analysis but really they are just using their gut.
Support levels and resistance levels for example. They don't really mean anything other than "it's unlikely to go above/below X soon but it could".
Intra day trading patterns do emerge/exist. These are profitable to trade until a black swan event occurs. When betting with the banks money, it's a great way to get paid because 95% of the time it'll work and you'll clip a bonus for risking the bank's money. The 10% of the time it doesn't work it wipes out the majority of your historical earnings. Taleb calls it "picking up pennies in front of a steamroller" - don't trip.
