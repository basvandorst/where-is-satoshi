Agreed.  The fee is equivalent to less than 1/4 of 1 cent USD per transaction.  If you send 1000 transactions (which would be 2-3 transactions daily for 1 year) you'll pay a whopping $2.30.
If this still is unacceptable you can always fork the code to remove this fee.  It's probably just a single function you can remove and the developers made it open source so there's nothing stopping you from doing this.

Interesting.  So why is denying having contacted BTC-e?  I guess now either OP stole the coins or BitDice made up the story to try and cover for what OP legitimately won.
I'm not sure why BTC-e would get involved though.  It's basically OP's word against BitDice's.  We have the blockchain transactions but no way of knowing whether the earnings were legitimate or not except for BitDice's word.
@_date: 2015-06-14 05:00:48
So if is telling the truth and does, in fact, own BitDice that means either:
1.  BTC-e made up the whole story and stole the coins for themselves.
2.  A third party spoofed an email from BitDice to BTC-e claiming the coins were stolen.  Hopefully BTC-e wasn't dumb enough to "return" the coins to the third party scammer.
In either case, this is pretty strange and not looking too good for OP.  He still has to negotiate with non-english speaking BTC-e support and hope they return the coins to him.

I use Bitcoin Core for my wallet but I can't run it 24/7 because, as it gets more connections, it maxes out my 384kbps upload speed and slows everything else down to a crawl.  I also have 2 Antminer S1's running on stratum but the bandwidth from that is so low I don't notice it even on my slow connection (also it seems to use mostly download and very little upload which is good since I have 3mbps download speed)  There's a pretty considerable difference.

It generates receiving bitcoin addresses right off the bat so you could go ahead and buy some bitcoins and send them to that address while it's downloading if you like (recommend making a backup of the wallet.dat file first.)  It won't show up in your balance in the client until you download the blockchain to the block where the bitcoins were sent though so you won't be able to spend them until you finish downloading.  You can always go to  to verify the transaction went through until then.
You can also sign messages with your bitcoin addresses and if you decide the download it taking too long and you have to spend your coins ASAP you can use the console to export your private key and import it into another wallet.

The drug war makes things even worse though.  Instead of taking an addict and giving them options for treatment they're spending tax payer money to lock them up for nonviolent crimes and then giving them a record making it hard to find legitimate work when they get out.  Addiction needs to be looked at as a public health issue and not a criminal issue.  That makes sense even if they truly only care about saving money and the GDP.
Their current line of thinking is so ass backwards in moral hipocracy that the only people it benefits is law enforcement and private prisons.  The former has authority over writing many of the drug laws (the DEA which has an obvious bias over wanting to keep the status quo) and the latter has an insane amount of lobbyists doing the same.
In short, yes, drugs ruin people's lives.  The drug war ruins many many more.

I mean my credit union has fees on things like overdrafts, buying checks, etc. but they don't have a minimum balance or direct deposit requirement and it's only something like $20-$50 to start a new account (not a fee, this goes into your account.)  I've never been charged a fee by them and they use the [Co-Op ATM network]( so there's ATMs all over the place I can use for free.
Online banks can also be good if you don't need branch services.  Just shop around basically.  There's plenty of options out there.  I've even had luck with Bank of America's eBanking (though I don't know if they still offer that to new accounts.)  Not that I'd necessarily recommend BofA but they let me do international wires to Bitstamp entirely online as well as ACH transfers to Coinbase with no problem.
It also may not be a good idea to mention Bitcoin when setting up a bank account.  Most personal bank accounts come with ACH transfers and wire transfers as standard services.  The bank just wants to make sure that personal bank accounts are being used primarily for household use.  If you come off saying you're an "investment trader" then of course they're going to push you towards a business account.

Well "forever" depends entirely on how long cex.io remains in business.  You know how Bitcoin companies come and go.  Also, that upfront cost is so stupidly high I don't think it matters much.  By the time the S1 becomes unprofitable (producing less bitcoins than it costs in electricity) it likely would have paid itself off and made at least a little profit.  The cloud GH/s will take almost 3 times longer just to pay themselves off and by the time they do, the difficulty will have risen so high they become near worthless.

I'm not a big fan of writing down passwords.  My strategy is to use bitcoin-qt, encrypt the wallet with a password I remember, and keep multiple backups (some local and some on could services.)  That way a thief would have to first acquire the wallet file by either stealing my hard drive or gaining access to my cloud storage and then on top of that get my password to decrypt it (which isn't written down anywhere.)
Also, if you're really talking big money say your house burns down and your only backup is the seed on a piece of paper... well say goodbye to your bitcoins.  Same thing if a thief educated in bitcoin breaks into your house.  They can just plug that seed in and transfer the coins before you know what happened.
The last point I'll make (and this could be completely wrong) is that it seems to me a private key derived entirely at random seems more secure to me than one derived of 12 small words.  I'm sure it's probably secure "enough" but I just trust the completely random algorithm of bitcoin-qt a little bit more.

It's shitty laundering even if you don't.  Just-dice has a log of bets.  The blockchain has a log of transactions.  Not too many people bet that big.  Large deposit comes in, large withdrawal comes out... not too hard to put 2 and 2 together.

Fuck all that.  A single mixer is probably more than enough for most uses.  Even without mixing, simply sending the coins from Coinbase or wherever you bought them from to a new empty wallet gives you plausible deniability.  "Oh I bought X with those bitcoins."  or "I sold those bitcoins for cash and that's the buyer's address."  There's no proof that you own the 2nd wallet even if it can be traced back to you.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:03:02
Armory actually ties in with the stock bitcoin client to add the offline wallet function.  Your offline machine doesn't need the blockchain (or Bitcoin Core.)  It's only job is to store your private keys and use them to sign transactions.
You then have your online computer which has the blockchain and both Bitcoin Core and Armory installed on it.  This computer does not have your private keys (only your public keys so you can view your balance and create unsigned transactions) so if this computer gets compromised you won't lose anything.
The way transactions work is you enter the address you want to send to into your online computer.  It knows the balances of your addresses and has the blockchain so it can create an unsigned transaction.  You save that unsigned transaction onto a USB flash drive then connect it to your offline computer.  The offline computer will sign that transaction, you connect it back to your online computer, and it broadcasts it to the network.
This has a more detailed description:

I think I read that max 8 somewhere too but that doesn't make sense to me.  The way I understand it you connect to peers kind of like you would with Bittorrent.  If you have your port forwarded it allows other peers to initiate the connection to you.  If you don't you're limited to outgoing connections to peers that have their port forwarded.  Two peers without their ports forwarded can't directly communicate. 
8 max connections just seems so arbitrary.  Theoretically there should be no limit to how many outgoing connections you can make.

If for some reason your job is using a home router, Bitcoin will use UPnP to forward the ports automatically.  If they consider security at all they probably have UPnP disabled however.
I think you can still run a node without the port forwarded but it limits how many peers you can connect to.

Hey if you have Wine installed, you can just double-click in some distros and it will execute.  I misunderstood that you meant to run a VM on top of the LiveCD.


Not always the case.  LiveCDs are almost always going to be outdated.  If there was a security bug in either the VM software or in the Linux kernel itself, the virus could exploit that.
I do agree that Linux is generally more secure though.  I dual boot but all my bitcoin stuff stays on the encrypted Linux partition.  If I had to test out a potentially malicious file like this, I would run the VM on Windows so not only would the virus have to break out of the VM but it would also have to find a way to decrypt my Linux partition.

I'm confused.  A 401k is a retirement account by definition.  If you withdrawal out of a 401k early you get hit with a pretty steep penalty PLUS you have to pay taxes on the entire balance since a 401k is taken out of your paycheck before income tax.  IIRC if you have a Roth 401k (as opposed to a traditional 401k) you may be able to take out your initial investment minus the gains without paying a penalty since that money has already been taxed.
If, on the other hand, you mean a non-401k non-retirement standard brokerage account, things become a whole lot simpler.  You can take that money out at any time, you just need to pay taxes on your gains (which you'll have to eventually anyway.)
In any case, I would never recommend throwing all your eggs into one basket.  If you're young and retirement is far off throw half of it in bitcoin if you want to be super aggressive.  Just make sure you research how to keep your wallet secure (preferably encrypted in cold storage with multiple backups) and don't make investment decisions based on emotion.  Thoroughly research your options and always have a reason why you think your decision is the right way to go.
I would also advise you check out and They'll give you a more conservative opinion and then you can choose a happy medium.  One thing I know from there is that you can cut out a lot of the fees the bank charges to "mange your money" by putting it in passively indexed ETFs and mutual funds.
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:04:17
Seriously?  You had 30 BTC sent to an online wallet you had no backups of and forgot the password?  I know you already feel bad enough but people need to learn how to manage their wallets.  I always recommend a local software wallet especially when dealing with large amounts (online wallets are fine for small spending as you originally intended it for.)  If you encrypt it make sure you know that password by heart or write it down if you have to.
As for what to do now I would suggest starting on your PC rather than your phone.  I haven't used the Android app but it's linked to a standard blockchain.info web wallet correct?  Chrome and Firefox will both show you all of your saved passwords.  In Firefox it's in Settings &gt; Security.  In Chrome, go to settings, show advanced settings, then click "manage saved passwords."  Even if blockchain.info isn't in there, you may have used the same password on another website.  Go ahead and look through all your passwords and see if one works.

Yea that's how payroll already works.  The problem usually comes when employees forget to punch in/out or for lunch.


That's not in the bitcoin protocol as far as I know nor would it help anything even if it were.  Calculating the amount earned is simple without all that.  They just need to record the transaction IDs so if any problems come up it's easy to reference in the blockchain to prove weather or not the transaction went through.
None of that stuff is the big problem though.  All bitcoin really helps with is transaction fees which aren't really all that expensive with traditional direct deposit methods.  There's a reason why so many companies are switching over from paper checks and that's because ACH direct deposit transactions are pretty cheap and efficient.
The reason we don't have daily pay schedules is because that would take a ton of manhours no matter which currency is used or how.  Take end of the year accounting.  Do you want to have to audit 365 records for paydays or 24?  Also income tax plays a large role.  You have to without X amount from each paycheck and set that aside (which I assume the IRS has to audit if need be so they might have a say against this as well.)  Plus employee benefits like medical insurance which are already set to a bi-weekly/monthly rate.  It just creates a lot of work for everyone.

Use bitcoin-qt.  You actually don't need to download the whole blockchain if you're just going to cold storage it.  The client will generate public and private keys right away when it's first started.  Click the receive button to get your bitcoin address, send the coins to that address, verify the transaction on blockchain.info, then copy your wallet.dat file to a USB drive or two (another option is to encrypt it then send it to a cloud storage service or do both for redundancy.)
That's it.  You're now in cold storage.  To spend the coins either import the wallet.dat into another wallet program (I believe Multibit and/or Blockchain.info have this capability) or use bitcoin-qt's dumpprivkey function to give you the private key in plain text.

It's definietly possible.  One way to go about it is to install the ARM libraries you need to link against (you could probably just copy-paste straight from the Pi) into a chroot environment and then tell the compiler to compile for ARM.  I don't know how long Bitcoin takes to compile but for things like Chromium that take over an hour to compile on my 3.3ghz quad core I imagine would take all day if you tried to compile on a Pi (and actually Chromium itself would probably fail due to the large RAM usage on the linking step)

IIRC last time this 51% scare happened in January GHash released a statement saying 50% of the hashing power **they** had was their cloud mining service.  This puts them at 25% of the total bitcoin network and they've been adding to that number since January.  A possible solution that has been discussed is to allow cloud miners to be able to switch pools.  Of course if GHash wanted to do an attack, they could simply turn off that feature at any time.
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:05:52
Dumb as fuck.  In Linux all you have to do is call /dev/random for a truly random number (as good as a standard CPU can get anyway.)

Well on the bright side Armory is open source so I forked it on GitHub to remove this behavior.  It looks to be done entirely in a single Python file so you don't even need to rebuild anything to make the change.  Just merge these changes into your announcefetch.py and you should be good to go.
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:09:02
None of that matters though if someone actually **owns** 51% of the mining power as opposed to simply owning the pool.  For example, we don't know how much of GHash's mining is in their "cloud mining" service which they fully control.  Even if they use getblocktemplate, they still own the individual miners so they can potentially still launch an attack.
Side note:  The Eligius pool has both stratum and getblocktemplate hosts.  They also have a 0% fee.  Consider switching so GHash'd doesn't become the next Gox'd.

Multibit has less risk.


That's not true at all.  Blockchain.info does not manage the actual bitcoin blockchain.  They simply provide a way to browse it (blockexplorer.com does the same) as well as an online wallet.  If blockchain.info were to go under, the bitcoin economy would continue on relatively unphased.  The only people that would be hit would be people storing their bitcoins there.  That's why you store your bitcoins locally so you're not dependent on a third-party.  To negate the risk of a broken hdd, just make multiple backups (and encrypt them to negate the risk of being hacked.)
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:08:30


How would you even go about linking the mining software to your node?  I've searched and can't find the answer.  Say you have a USB miner for simplicity and you're using a miner like cgminer/bfgminer and bitcoin-qt for the node.
Also, what happens if you use GBT and don't have the miner connected to a node.  I'm running a couple Antminer S1's and don't see a way to do that so I might as well be running Stratum right?  Otherwise I'd just increase my bandwidth for no benefit if I'm understanding right.
I think this is why GBT never caught on.  There's no practical way to actually utilize the decentralization benefits.

If you were to buy an Antminer S1, that would cost you 0.409 BTC for 160 GH/s (0.00255625 BTC per GH/s)  Obviously you would have to house the unit and pay for electricity but that's almost 3 times cheaper per GH/s and electricity doesn't cost nearly that much.

Can you elaborate more on the guy that testified to imaging Ross's computer?  What you said doesn't really mean incompentence unless I'm missing something.
First of all "disk destroyer" or dd is a legitamite tool for data recovery/backup.  It only earned the nickname because *if you type a command wrong* you can zap your data.  Example:
    dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/home/reddit/somefile
Will make a backup of the first partion.  Mix that up and do:
    dd if=/home/reddit/somefile of=/dev/sda1
Assuming "somefile" exists (and it wasn't a backup you intended to store) you just wrote overwrote your hard drive's partition and probably corrupted the underlying filesystem.  Woops!  Disk destroyed!
Also, it doesn't matter if he took hashes days or even weeks after he imaged the hard drive.  If the hard drive has remained in chain of custody, the hash isn't going to be any different.  A hash is mainly used to verify data integrety (and in this case I'm assuming he's using a hash to verify that the data from the physical hard drive is identical to the image he took)  For example if you downloaded the bitcoin client, you can run a sha256hash on it and get:
    c425783b6cbab9b801ad6a1dcc9235828b98e5dee6675112741f8b210e4f65cd  bitcoin-0.9.3-linux.tar.gz
The Bitcoin authors took that days/weeks ago when that version was released but the hash isn't any different now.  A hash doesn't change unless the underlying data changes.
One additional thing I'll note (and this may be a bit of a stretch) but if it really was md5 that they used for the hashes, there **may** be a chance to get that thrown out as there have been proven collision attacks against md5 (where you get two sets of non-identical data to produce identical hashes.)  I doubt if we'll get that lucky but I would be happy as hell if we can get Ross off and get md5 universally discredited in one fell swoop :P

Bank of America lets you do it online.  Not that I'd recommend them per se but they have that going for them heh.
If you're trading $10k+ it's probably worth your time going to the bank though as you can save a couple hundered on fees.  The paper work is most likely just a single form where you put Bitsamp's bank information and the amount you want to send.

Do you not realize how many Bitcoin businesses have been hacked? (including Bitstamp just this month)  Meanwhile I haven't lost a single satoshi from what I store locally.
The risk isn't just from Coinbase being hacked as a whole site either.  It could be targetted against your account.  Say someone stole your phone.  Good chance they now have access to your 2FA and email giving them a good shot at getting into whatever coins you have stored on your online wallets.
I mean do what you like with your money but that's a pretty silly statement to make.  I know I feel a lot safer about having my BTC stored encrypted on my local desktop and a few backup places.  Breaking into that requires significantly more effort than cracking an online account.
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:13:19
Idk... Which exchange are you using?  Coinbase for example will lock your price in when you put in the buy order so you're waiting on the money to transfer but when it finalizes you'll still be getting it for $200 or whatever the price was when you hit "Buy"

I've just been trading on Bitstamp.  I just make sure I desposit Bitcoin and then end up with (hopefully more) Bitcoin to withdrawl when I'm done so I don't have to deal with international fiat transfers.  No fees to deposit or withdrawal BTC though.

I doubt Coinbase would ban you for "James Kang" though... it's fucking weird that PayPal does.  I Googled him and just got some doctor in Pittsburg.  I don't get it.  I'm not gonna try though... I depend on Coinbase for buying BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-27 09:29:47
It's a little different in Coinbase's case because they're also exchanging USD.  It would be similar to exchanging USD for, say Euros.  They US government does't have any control over the Euro but they still need to regulate the USD end of it.  You also get the benefit of FDIC insurance so so you can be assured that once you put money into the exchange it won't just dissapear.
Once you're converted into BTC it becomes more difficult for the government to try to require licensing for buying/selling good directly for BTC since it doesn't involve fiat (and it's even more difficult for them to actually enforce it.)

Bitstamp. Unless you're extremely wealthy you won't have a problem buying as much as you need.  The fees are also lower than coinbase and scale down the more you buy.  Buying 40k would set you at 0.3% commission compared to Coinbase's flat 1%.
Only downside is you have to do an international wire transfer (which can cost $20-$40 maybe more) so for small amounts it's slower and more expensive than Coinbase but if you're buying a lot (or plan to trade frequently) you'll end up saving money because of the lower commission fees.

It's not risky.  Either both the incoming and outgoing transactions get confirmed or neither of them will.  It's how those "on the blockchain" gambling sites work.  You send them a bet and then they send you the winnings using your bet as an input.  That way they're protected against double spends because if your bet never confrims then your winnings won't confirm either.
All a traditional merchant has to do is wait X confirmations like they do any other transaction.

Because in the stock market you're buying and selling something of intrinsic value (shares of a company.)  The stock market is also directly linked to the economy as a whole (not just the economy of active stock traders.)
With bitcoin you're buying and selling made up 1s and 0s with no intrinsic value whatsoever.  The market share is very low comparitively and its value can't be linked to any real external factors.
@_date: 2013-10-21 21:40:53

So can you not move &lt;0.01 BTC at all?  Even if you're willing to pay the transaction fee?  The transaction fee is 0.0001 but you need 100 times more than that before you'll let someone actually use the bitcoin they just got tipped?
0.01 BTC is almost $2 at the moment and most people are not likely to receive that much in tips.  I actually use Coinbase to purchase bitcoins and I really do like your service but this BitTip sounds like a poorly hidden ploy to get as many people to sign up for Coinbase accounts as possible.

Fiat isn't going away anytime soon.  What two things are certain in life?  Death and taxes.  Fiat currency is much easier to tax and governments aren't going to want to give up control over money.  Not too mention, we have **way** too much invested in fiat.  Even if all the big cooperations wanted to switch over to Bitcoin *right now,* it could take 20 years just to finish implemintation and regulation (can't pay your 10,000 employees in Bitcoin without the government's approval.)


I hope you're right there, I really do.  However, we don't know if it will be Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency.  Bitcoin just hasn't been around long enough to make anything but guesses as to what it will do.  One thing I can tell you is that fiat will stick around for a good long time and it's value doesn't fluctuate insanely like bitcoin does.

Agreed.  IMO if you want to day trade stick to the stock market.  There's no insurance on funds stored in an exchange and probably little you could do even if the exchange decided to criminally run off with everyone's money.  This goes double if the exchange is outside the US (assuming you're American.)  If you tried to go to court on it, they'd probably stop listening when you tell them you knowingly wired money to Slovenia.
tl;dr:  It's probably best to save yourself a lot of hassle and just buy your Bitcoins then transfer them to a local wallet where they're not at risk.

I've had no problems with BofA for my bitcoin needs.  I've done multiple transactions with Coinbase both buying and selling and all have come through on time.
Also of note that while a lot of banks are disallowing international money wires, BofA will let you do the entire process online.  I just sent one to Bitstamp but it's Friday night so it won't go in until next week.  We'll see how that goes but I'm optimistic.  The wire fees will end up costing me more than Coinbase but I just wanted to see how Bitstamp compares.
I know BofA has done a lot of shitty stuff especially with their housing lending and I'm not trying to defend that.  I'm just saying for my purposes they've worked just fine.

Just what it sounds like.  They take your coins and put them in with other people's coins and then send them around in various increments to a bunch of different addresses so then when they come out (theoretically) no one knows where they originally came from.  Bitcoinfog is one such service 
You're supposed to access the real site through Tor... that's just an information site.  Also it's kind of a trust issue that they won't just run away with your coins (just like every other online wallet) but they've been in operation for a while now and haven't pulled anything to my knowledge.

I have Bank of America and have made numerous withdrawals to Coinbase to purchase Bitcoin with no problems but I've never done the reverse.
What happened with Chase?
The reports of bank accounts being closed that I read were from international wire transfers.  Coinbase uses the domestic ACH system (the same system used by many employers for Direct Deposit.)  These types of transactions, from what I understand, are far more common and less likely to raise eyebrows as international (or even domestic) wire transfers (an ACH transaction is not the same thing as a wire transfer.)
As long as Coinbase has been open if this was a problem at all, we would have heard about it by now so I feel fairly confident you won't have any problems as far as BofA is concerened.
That said, one thing you should definietely consider is that if this is going to be a large deposit they may report it to the IRS as income and you'll have to pay taxes on it.  I doubt the IRS has a policy on Bitcoin specifically but if you're getting large sums of money deposited into your bank account there's a good chance they will take notice and take their cut.

Read up on tax laws in your country.  If it's the US, I'd be very careful.  The IRS tends to not like it when, say, 100 grand seems to appear out of nowhere.  They could try to say it was laundered drug money or some stupid shit.  Depends a lot on what the bitcoin regulation laws look like between now and then.
A good traditional (fiat) way to save for a house would be a Roth 401k or Roth IRA.  I'm just now setting up my first 401k so I'm a little fuzzy on the laws but IIRC if the retirement savings is Roth (meaning the money was already taxed on your income but can be withdrawn tax-free vs. non-Roth where it's the opposite) then you can use that tax-advataged money (that has hopefully grown with interest) to buy a house.  With Bitcoin, you'd be taxed on income (assuming you earn your income in fiat) and then most likey taked again when you convert back to fiat.  Bitcoin can easily increase in value enough to make up for that and then some but it's worth keeping in mind.
At 17, yea, you can be risky as hell with your money (with the benefit of high potential returns) but if I were you I still wouldn't keep all my eggs in one basket.  My employer for example will match 50% of what I put into my 401k up to 3% of my paycheck.  So I just put 3% in the 401k to take advantage of that.  I'm also somewhat invested in Bitcoin but I'm going to make sure I build a decent safety net in standard fiat savings as well.

That's a rather odd view.  Things like food always have intrinsic value.  Wood and gasoline also have intrinsic value because you can build shelter and create fire with them.  They provide utility in and of themselves.  They can also be used to trade for other goods but that's beside the point.
Conversly a wad of cash may have huge value to you now but only because you can trade it for other goods.  If the government collapsed or inflation rose to insane levels, that same wad of cash would be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on.  Cash provides no utility in its own right.
See the difference?  Bitcoin goes right along with cash there.  It's used soley for trading purposes and only has value because we say it has value whereas a juicy steak will always fill you up regardless of its value in comparison to other goods.

If the keylogger logs you typing in the password then yes.  That also applies to bitcoin-qt's encryption as well as just about anything else that uses password based security.
Using a keyfile instead of a password may help but if an attacker is able to install software on your computer, they could install a trojan that sceen captures you selecting the keyfile and uploads the file back to them.  Making sure your computer stays virus and trojan free should always be a top priority as they can make most other layers of security useless.

Stop refering to Mt. Gox for the going exchange rate.  It's long been inaccurate since the lack of availible fiat withdrawals has artifically driven the price up.  I use Bitstamp as my go-to but best practice is probably to take an average of a couple exchanges.

We don't know what it's going to do in the long-term though.  Governments could ban it, someone could find a critical exploit in it, another cryptocurrency could overtake it.  Any one of those things could drop the value of bitcoin substansially.
Compare that to a fiat savings account where in 5 or 10 years, you may not get shit from intrest but you can be sure your money will still be there (FDIC insured.)  Inflation may reduce the value to a certain degree but nowhere near the extremes of bitcoin.  The high returns early investors got nearly always comes with high risk as well.
@_date: 2013-07-07 05:09:54
If you're just using the bitcoins as a way to transfer money, I would look into just using Western Union or MoneyGram to send the money oversees at least to see if it doesn't end up being cheaper.  There's a good chance the money will get there faster that way too.  Yes, a Bitcoin transfer can get there in an hour or so but that's after you buy the bitcoins.  Coinbase takes 4 business days, BitInstant is fast but you'll end up paying more in fees, and then if your friend is withdrawing the money into a bank account, that's another delay... it could end up taking a week or two easy whereas a Western Union or MoneyGram transfer can get there same/next day.  Of course if anonymity in a concern, bitcoin may be the way to go.
EDIT:  Another thing you should think about is that $100 worth of Bitcoins today may only be worth $50 in a week.  You could easily lose more money that way too in addition to the fees that the exchanges charge.  Bitcoin is great for a lot of things but if your friend is just going to sell the bitcoins as soon as he gets them, it may be better to use the traditional money transfer services.

You should never have that much in an online wallet period.  Think about how much a lot of you hate banks for a moment.  Now pretend your bank no longer has FDIC insurance, has only been in existance for a couple of years, and there's no way to dispute a transaction.  That's what an online wallet is.
There's literally nothing you can do if your account gets hacked, the online wallet service goes bankrupt (perhaps due to legal trouble or if their whole infatructure gets hacked/comprimised somehow), or they simply decide they can make a fuckton of money by running off with everyone's coins.
With bitcoin, you have the advantage of decentralization.  Take advantage of it.  If you want to use an online wallet to keep maybe 1 or 2 BTC max for convience, go for it but any more than that needs to be kept safe.  Use a local wallet.  Put that wallet.dat in a TrueCrypt container.  Make a lot of backups.  By using TrueCrypt or equivilent you can even safely use cloud storage and an attacker will never even know the file contains a bitcoin wallet at all much less the value of it.  Furthermore, even if the cloud service itself went rouge they can't even access it since you encrypted the file before you ever sent it to them.

All I was trying to say is that bitcoin is in its infancy and people need to have a totally different mindset about it compared to what they're used to (the fiat banking system and credit cards.)


Currently this does not exist but if bitcoin becomes mainstream I believe it will become a necessity.
In any case, you seem to be missing the point of bitcoin and that is to have a currency that is controlled solely by the people that use it and not any one government.  If bitcoin really catches on, it will likely have payment processors doing a lot of what credit card companies and banks do (protect against fraudulent transactions, loan money, insure against theft, etc.)

I'm not going to claim to be an expert on safes but so far there has not been a single exploit in AES encryption while safe-cracking and locksmithing are professions.  In most cases, your method will work fine but just saying if you want absolute certainty I wouldn't keep plain-text copies of the private keys at all (which is all paper wallets are.)  The only reason to have one at all is if you forget your encryption passphrase (and they could very well be worth it just in case that does happen.)
From what I understand if you want to make sure the contents of your safe stay private, post a picture of it on Reddit.

Use Bistamp next time for this.  The fees are less than Coinbase and you can hold USD in your account without making a withdrawal to your bank.  Perfect for when you plan to buy back later.  I did the same but I was at work all day so I missed the $800s completely.  Sold last night at $1040 when I saw it dropping.  Came home from work today and saw the price at ~$950.  Just as I was planning on buying some whale came and jumped the price up to $990.  Still made some free coins out of it.  This can be risky but you can also make a decent profit if you're careful.

It shouldn't be mandatory.  If a user is forced to pick a password on first-run, chances are high they will either pick the same weak password they use for everything or pick one they won't remember and then lose access to all their coins.  Besides, in most cases even an unencrypted local wallet is going to be safer than an online wallet as theft would be limited to those with physical access to the computer rather than the entire internet.

+JFknCHRIST 1 internet verify
There's a few cents more to get you started.  I know some people look down on "beggers" but hey, I'd give someone a quarter if they were short one to buy a Coke and I'd definetely do the same to spread the awesomeness that is Bitcoin.  Just click [this link]( for the syntax to withdraw those coins to an address of your choosing.
As far as aquiring more, there's plenty of ways.  If you're in the US, the two best ways I've found are [CoinBase]( and [LocalBitcoins.](  CoinBase is the cheapest (only a 1% fee + 15 cents per transaction) if you don't mind linking your bank account.  LocalBitcoins is the simplest way if you just want to pay cash (though the fees are higher.)  LocalBitcoins also has people doing online transactions with things like MoneyPak and cash depoits into Bank of America and the like but I've always just stuck with the in-person meetups.  Not as sketchy as it sounds if you just use common sense.  Everyone I've delt with through there has been great and done the transaction in front of me.  Best practice is to meet in public somewhere like a coffee shop.  Then it's as simple and handing over the cash, and verifying the bitcoins are in your account (which happens instantly if you use their transaction service and can be done without a device on your end by comparing the verify codes.)
EDIT:  Just read:


Any particular reason why not?  Bitcoin has real world value just like the fiat most of us earn for a living.  Otherwise they wouldn't be worth anything and there would be little point (Hell look into the Bitcoin test-chain if that's your thing.  Probably plenty of people giving out free worthless coins on there.)  I think there are a few sites where you can sell items for Bitcoins (including even illegal items if that's your thing :P) or you can offer some other service and accept Bitcoins as payment instead of or in addition to fiat.  Basically the same ways you would earn fiat.
Of course, another, more risky option would be to gamble the coins I just gave you on one of the many Bitcoin gambling sites but I'm not going to give you more when you lose it all :P

The physical $20 bill has no relevence on its value (assuming it's legitamite currency and not counterfiet.)  Even if you were to rip in half, you could simply bring both halves to a bank and exchange it for a new bill.  This is because cash is just a token of value.
There can be no "good" or "bad" bills.  If there were, it would completely throw off the value of the USD as billions of dollars would be taken out of circulation every day.  You think the police burn siezed drug money?  Hell no, they use that money.
The same can be said about bitcoin but it's even more streightforward because there is no physical component.  As long as the transaction confirms on the blockchain (equivilent to saying "as long as the cash is not counterfiet"), then your bitcoins have value.  If some backwards-ass regulation declares your address "dirty" then you can simply mix the coins to a new address (just like how you can exchange a ripped $20 bill for a new one.)  I don't see how that would really catch on though.  It would be like cops burning the drug money.  It just doesn't make sense.

@_date: 2013-11-05 05:03:09
Bitcoin-qt only encrypts your private keys.  Anyone with access to that wallet.dat will be able to see your public keys (and therefore your previous transactions and current ballance.)  If you have a quality password they still wouldn't be able to spend it but if they can see you have $100,000 worth of bitcoins in there, you can be your ass they're going to try every attack method they can think of.
My line of thought is that Bitcoin-qt's encryption is most likely good enough for local backups but for cloud backups I'm going to add an extra layer of security with TrueCrypt.  Not only does it encrypt your public keys but it hides the fact that it's a bitcoin wallet all together and also protects you against a potential future exploit of bitcoin-qt's encryption.  Remember OP was talking about $70k here.  The maybe 10 minutes it takes to set up TrueCrypt is well worth it for peace of mind on that kind of cash.

Oh shit.  I've made 2 international wires from Bank of America to Bitstamp without issue.  Now you've got me worried.  I don't know of an alternative for international wires.  I just opened an account with a local credit union but they don't do international wires at all.  Bank of America just seemed so easy.  I could do the whole transfer online and the money was credited to Bitstamp in less than 24 hours.

I disagree with your second point.  With current encryption technology, it's more feasable for a thief to break into your home and crack your safe than it is for them to crack quality digital encryption.  Also think of government seizures (not to infer you're doing anything illegal but the FBI would have had DPR's cold storage bitcoins long ago if he kept a paper wallet.)
Unsure of your reasoning on the third point.  IMO the best way to transfer coins from cold storage is to use something like Armory where you sign the transaction on the offline computer and use a USB stick to run it to the online computer (the latter never sees the private keys.)  Creating a new private key shouldn't hurt you but I don't see the point.

You think the US government collapsing is more likely than bitcoin losing value?  Bitcoin has only a very short history during which its value halved over the course of a week.  The dollar is very stable by comparison.  Once cryptocurrincies take off, then you could be right as they won't depend on any one government but we're not there yet.  Bitcoin could easily be replaced by another cryptocurrency or be made illegal by various governments making it so hard to get it looses its value.

Bitcoin also charges 10-20 cents per transaction... They really need to adjust it for deflation though.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:27:22
I have a theory.  I read an article (came out before SR closed IIRC) on the downsides of bitcoin and it stated that only a small percentage of the total number of bitcoins are in active circulation.  Not to say that the rest are lost but a ton of them are just sitting in people's wallets increasing in value (relative to fiat.)  The article claimed this lack of supply as one of the causes of bitcoin's increasing value.
Like it or not, Silk Road was probably the biggest marketplace to accept bitcoin.  Now that it's closed, some people are just holding onto coins that otherwise would have been circulated around.  This also becomes sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy because as bitcoin gets more and more valuable, it gives people more and more incentive to hold onto them.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:53:19
Yes but that's more of a utility of the wallet software.  I'm talking about bitcoin as a currency, not the software.  Either way, that argument is very weak.  It's like saying a $100 bill has utility because you can use it as paper and write on it.
@_date: 2013-10-13 16:25:08
Are you using Bitcoin-qt? If so the encrypt and backup options are right there in the menu... Takes about 2 clicks and a few keystrokes to set up. For extra security encrypt your entire flash drive using LUKS or TrueCrypt (I'll let you Google those.) since Bitcoin-qt's native encryption only encrypts the private keys so if someone were to obtain your wallet they wouldn't be able to spend your coins but they would be able to see your balance and your list of transactions. If you encrypt the entire flash drive, they wouldn't even be able to tell you had a Bitcoin wallet on there at all.

That's because people need to learn to treat bitcoins as digital cash and not use them like you would a credit card.


Would you advertise how much cash you have in your home and then use a weak combination on your safe?


Would you trust a third party to hold onto a large amount of your cash without doing your research on them?
Comparing bitcoin to credit cards is like comparing apples to oranges.  Credit cards heavily favor the buyer so if I were buying some expensive electronics or buying a service that I may later have a problem with I would go credit cards every time because I know if all else fails I can contact the bank and stand a good chance of getting my money back.
However if I were sending money to a friend or perhaps paying for a meal bitcoin would do just fine.  Of course bitcoin also has the advantage of lower fees, faster transaction times, and no third party to control where you can and can't spend your money but again, apples to oranges.

Mt. Gox is not a bank and there is no reason you should leave money with them.  If you want to invest in bitcoins, then buy bitcoins but transfer them to an address where you and you alone control the private key. Watch the market and hopefully watch the value of your investment grow.
Instead, what you've done is wired money oversees to a failing business where you have no legal protection (like you would with FDIC if it were in a US bank.)  They could go bankrupt tomorrow and leave you with nothing but a "We're sorry" e-mail.  That's not an investment, it's not even a gamble.  It's just stupidity.
@_date: 2013-09-03 21:59:52
Bitcoin-qt is the only one I've ever used personally (I guess bitcoin-qt could be considered the official client.)  It's best for the network as a whole if a lot of people use it because it helps forward other people's transactions in the background while it's open.  It also has a nice encryption feature (if enabled it requires you to type in your password every time you send money.)  It's not as good as TrueCrypt encryption because only the private keys are encrypted.  Your full list of transactions and public addresses are plain-text for anyone with access to wallet.dat to read.  That's why I prefer TrueCrypt for backups (just name the TrueCrypt container "backup" or something obscure and no one can even tell what it is) but the built-in encryption is very nice for protecting you while you have the application running (say you walk away from your laptop for a second in a public place.)
The only downside is that it requires you to download the entire blockchain which is quite large.  I think MultiBit is a good alternative that doesn't require you to download the blockchain (could be wrong about that though, I've never used it personally.)
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:08:50
International wire transfers are trickier to reverse since they depend on the coroporation of the receiving foreign bank but it can be done especially if the sender has proof it was a fraudenlent transaction (say for example their online banking password was compromised)
If I wasn't going through a major exchange like Bitstamp or maybe Coinbase I wouldn't take any form of payment except cash or maybe gold.
EDIT: I would add that if you have to accept electronic payment (which I wouldn't recommend) wire transfers would still be your best bet. ACH transfers are more easily reversed but are still way better than PayPal and the like (never heard of Net teller but it sounds like they provide a similar service.) PayPal is very biased towards the buyer if an accusation of fraud comes up.

That's not intrinsic value.  Please at least read the definition.  I'm just going to copy-paste my other comment that explains the difference.
That's a rather odd view. Things like food always have intrinsic value. Wood and gasoline also have intrinsic value because you can build shelter and create fire with them. They provide utility in and of themselves. They can also be used to trade for other goods but that's beside the point.
Conversly a wad of cash may have huge value to you now but only because you can trade it for other goods. If the government collapsed or inflation rose to insane levels, that same wad of cash would be worth nothing more than the paper its printed on. Cash provides no utility in its own right.
See the difference? Bitcoin goes right along with cash there. It's used soley for trading purposes and only has value because we say it has value whereas a juicy steak will always fill you up regardless of its value in comparison to other goods.

I'm feeling pretty good about selling the majority of my bitcoins at $925 right about now.
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:47:42
IMO you should use Bitstamp for transaction this large.  I know that international wires can be a pain but Bitstamp is better equipped for what you're trying to do.  For starters, their fee *starts off* at half (0.5% vs Coinbase's 1%) and then goes down with every trade you make.
Perhaps more importantly, you would never be "locked in" at a certain price and be unable to limit your losses because Bitstamp allows you to hold USD in your account.  When you buy, you're instantly credited BTC and when you sell you're instantly credited USD.  If you see the price start to plummet you can sell and then rebuy when it levels off (of course you can just as easily fuck this up and lose money.)
You got very lucky that Coinbase decided to give you the lower BTC price.  They didn't have to do that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:46:54
Unfortunately this is why I'm hesitant to pay for services like this with bitcoin.  If I were to pay with my credit/debit card I'd be able to do a chargeback and get my money back if they didn't hold up their end.  If I pay with bitcoin, there's nothing I could really do if they decided to just run off with my money.

If you already have accounts with multiple banks, use one without a large balance to do your BTC stuff. That way if the worst happens and they freeze your account, you won't lose access to the majority of your money. That's the way I'd do it in any case if I were doing international wire transfers. I just stick with Coinbase though because I can't justify spending $50+ for an international wire. Coinbase uses domestic ACH and only costs 15 cents... Can't beat that.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:45:54
They most certainly are an online wallet.  They claim not to have access to your private keys and I have no reason to think they're lying but all it takes is for them to change a couple lines of code to put your private keys in a database on your next login.  I don't use them much but someone else mentioned they email a backup token or something to you.  If true, that means the attacker could have gained access to OP's email account and used that to gain access to his blockchain.info account.  That's just another attack vector that doesn't need to exist.  With a cold storage wallet, you're either breaking the AES encryption or you're not gaining access.
Also you're neglecting the possibilty that blockchain.info could go under.  Not saying it's likely but say the feds decide to swoop in and shut down the blockchain.info website.  How are you going to get to your money now?  Answer:  You're not because you're dependent on a single point of failure as opposed to the decentralized nature bitcoin was build around.
Yes I sound paranoid here but OP was talking about his entire life savings.  Why would you not be paranoid about that?
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:51:37
Too late for you now but the best option is always to store your wallet encrypted on your local hard drive (preferably with a backup or two in case of hard drive failure).  I use the official bitcoin-qt client and I know that's secure... not sure about other clients but really anything is better than using an online wallet.  Reason being there's nothing stopping that online wallet service from going rouge, taking everyone's coin, and dissapearing.  Also they could be hacked and lose your coins that way.
@_date: 2013-09-12 02:59:03
I use Coinbase buy I only buy BTC, never sell.  Coinbase uses the same ACH system for deposits and withdrawls but deposits into your bank account can look like taxable income to the IRS.  Be careful if you do this a lot because your bank can report it (and I believe they're required by law to report any deposit over $10,000.)
On the bright side, Coinbase has been running strong for a while now with no reports of frozen bank accounts or anything that I've seen.  It helps a lot that it's a US based company using domestic ACH transactions.  International wire transfers are where banks start raising an eyebrow and possibly freeze accounts if the amounts are large or frequent enough.
If I need to sell Bitcoins, I use localbitcoins.com to meet in person for cash.  It may take a bit longer to find a buyer and set up a meeting but you can sell for 10% above market price and make a profit if you like (depending on your local market of course) rather than paying Coinbase a fee.
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:08:45


That's less secure than using bitcoin-qt or another local wallet. If someone gets your password your coins are as good as gone. There's also the chance that blockchain.info gets hacked or goes rouge. With a local wallet, you eliminate those risks. Just **backup!!!** A wallet.dat is usually less than 1MB. You could make a backup on a floppy if you wanted. Have a couple local copies and also a couple copies on Dropbox or whatever. For extra security (especially recommended if you use Dropbox) put your wallet.dat into a TrueCrypt container before you upload. That way if someone gains access to your DropBox, they don't even have to know you have a Bitcoin wallet file in there, much less be able to spend it.

Yes.  It can feed a cat (and possibly a person if they were hungry enough.)


I see where you're going here.  To you those items will have little value (aside from possible bartering with them.)  Yes, the absolute value of something is always going to be relative.  However, they still have *intrinsic* value because they provide utility.  Maybe not to you but if used in bartering, they will most likely be worth *something* due to that utility.


Can you exchange values with Zimbabwean dollars?  They're worthless and the same thing can happen to any currency.

If he was smart, only a small percentage of the bitcoins (the "hot wallet") that need to be imediatly ready to transfer would be on the web server. The rest should be in "cold storage" meaning the only copies of the private keys would be on external storage devices or computers not connected to the internet and, optimally, encrypted and in a desperate physical location from everything else.
DPR may have made a bunch of mistakes but we're taking about $500+ Million worth of bit coins here. You would have to assume he would have taken *some* precausions to secure it.

I'm not talking about FDE.  I'm talking about a TrueCrypt **container** that you would encrypt before backing up your wallet file.  You could do the same on the computer running the bitcoin application though by symlinking the bitcoin folder to a TrueCrypt container (should be in C:\Users\YourUser\AppData and yes Windows supports symlinks.)
That way you can chose to only mount that container while it's in use so that the encryption key doesn't hang around in memory the entire time the OS in running.

Well you can just make a new address for every person who you want to receive from (which I believe is best practice anyway) but they can log on later and see what you did with the coins they just sent you and there's really no way around that unless you use a mixing service.
