As a Chinese, I’m really fed up with what the policy makers. All they care about is how to stabilize the rulings, not the quality, or fairness of people’s life

Yup, to tell you the truth, huobi and okcoin are not Chinese companies any more. They moved out of China since last year

I always checkout the video of Ivan, he’s brilliant

Thanks, I agree with you on this. My country is kinda special, maybe they will need to rethink about this. Plus, I found that using crypto currencies is really magical. I sent someone a bit of ethereum, it arrived less than a minute, and that guy is outside of my country, fees were less than 0.1$

If China only embraces some “centralized” version of cryptos, what is the point of this?  I don’t see any significant difference between fiat and “centralized” cryptos. It’s like you want the tires but not the engine

As a Chinese, I Can’t believe it! My country hate bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:02:25
I agree that bitcoin is a store of value. But, would it hurt the fiat? Many countries see bitcoin as a threat!

China really hates bitcoin, it has strict capital controls 
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:42:12
Actually, they totally banned the trade of cryptos

Wow, what you said really amazed me. I always read the news on the mainstream media of China. The policy makers emphasized several times that they won’t allow bitcoin to be traded or accepted in China. And 99% of the people around me don’t understand bitcoin, they thought it was a scam!

Wow, but what is the disadvantages of Thailand?
