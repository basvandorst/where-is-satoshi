I really like him talking about an era where we will see many different currencies! I believe that in the future even every big company and every nation will have it’s own digital currency. Those who aren’t on board, risk being left behind. The mother of all digital currencies will hopefully still be Bitcoin ����
@_date: 2019-07-23 05:19:52
This looks just like a normal fiat ATM with Bitcoin stickers on it at the bottom. Are you sur you can buy bitcoin there? �� Also this ATM is not the newest....
@_date: 2019-07-23 14:11:56
That’s cool then, never heard about that...

It’s like asking for a context to use a Big Mac.

I like the trezor’s user experience more. It’s all webbased and compared to the ledger nano s you don’t need additional software/apps. I got both and also the ledger works great, so up to you buddy
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:01:35
Totally agree! My girlfriend just sold an item via 'Depop' a couple of days ago. This app let's customers only pay via paypal. They take a cut of 6% of the payment, that's unbelievable...
@_date: 2019-07-21 13:14:59
Weird, I thought only Bitcoin is used for buying drugs...
@_date: 2019-07-19 20:41:19
Just tell him you lost the keys
@_date: 2019-07-20 06:33:45
I prefer the trezor, but to be honest with you, it doesn’t really matter, they are both very trustworthy hardware wallets...
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:24:15
Which company provides the order terminals? Does anyone know? I also work for a company who specializes in the process of selfordering, focused on the gastronomy. All of this is very exciting, but connecting with the Bitcoin LN network is the future, just look at it, great! ���� 
@_date: 2019-07-20 06:31:31
If you can afford, buy a „trezor“ (hardwarewallet) and store your coins there. It’s totally worth it, especially if you want to buy more in the years coming. It’s about 70€/80$, only buy from the official homepage though. ( good luck, you can do that easily and NOO to answer your question;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:59:37
That's why btc will be the answer! Think out of the box, it's not only about making transactions faster. There is much more power in Bitcoin! Go Poolman!!

If you want to buy more you can also go to various atms e.g. 3 days in a row and buy thousands...
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:01:08
TEN X offer the same kind of card. You get a wallet that’s connected to a card. You can even deposit other cryptos, not only btc. At the moment they are still working on a new license as visa stopped cooperating, but should hopefully be back working soon with their own banking license. I used it last year when it was still working - really liked it! Applying for the card may take a while, the sooner the better, good luck!
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:04:36

Yes indeed, he could easily start his own twittercoin but the difference with Jack is that he truly understands Bitcoin and he really wants it to become the money of the internet (sure that would be good for his cash app too). With twittercoin he would only be a competitor to all other shitcoins, this guy is betting on the right horse/bull!

Depending on where you live and how much you wanna buy, purchasing at an ATM could be a good option for you. In my hometown i pay a 2.9% (which is good for ATMs) and it’s completely anonymous up to 500€, no registration, no ID needed and it’s fast, safe and easy...
@_date: 2019-03-02 08:12:08
What? Wow that sounds already like too much effort for private people (like me) who just want to support the network...
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:39:33
I’d go to work like that! Tell me where to get it and i’ll send you guys a pic from my office!
@_date: 2019-03-10 19:22:07
If you store your coins on a ledger or trezor, you add another layer of security and no one can take anything away from you anyway. Even if they know your IP adress. Please correct me if I am wrong...

I still think it's a very exciting time in the Bitcoin space, don't really understand what you are moaning about. Cycles are normal and some big investors will always cash out at some point. For the majority this is about making money, for a minority it's about the technology, for others it's about a revolution...

If you really want to get rid of your 30$ in btc, you could also add it to the “bitcoin lightning torch”, at the end of it all the profits go to a venezuelan charity. All you need to do is set up a bitcoin lightning account, which will only take a couple of minutes and is super easy to use ;)

@_date: 2019-02-10 20:35:53
You’re right, thx for your correction, so now we’re talking about a 170€ spread, that’s a little bit different now,, haha
OK, so they charge a 5.7% fee when selling your btc

It let’s you choose in the beginning if you want to buy/sell more or less than 250€. If you go for more than 250, you need to create an account and scan your ID. But like i said, in theory you can go for &lt;250 and use as many different receiving/sending (depending if you wanna buy or sell) adresses as you like and this way ‚bypass‘ the KYC...
@_date: 2019-02-25 07:12:46

Sorry, forgot to mention that i took the pic last thursday (before the “pump”) when btc price was at  ~3400$ which equals 2999€. On that day they offered to buy your bitcoin for 2929€, that’s a 70€ spread. I think this is pretty fair.

@_date: 2019-02-10 20:16:04
Only if you want to buy/sell more than 250€/transaction. Let’s say you have eg 4 wallets, you could buy/sell 1000€/day without KYC. So theoretically there is no KYC needed...

I’m not the biggest fan of coinbase, but it’s definitely not shady. Coinbase is one of the most reliable exchanges out there plus it’s very easy to use for newcomers. Wherever you buy your btc, whether it’s gemini, coinbase, kraken, binance...,just make sure that you withdraw your coins and store/hold them yourself in a hardwallet like trezor or ledger (don’t forget to keep your passphrase very safe)
@_date: 2019-04-10 06:05:13

Seeing this chart, everyone will again believe that it’s too late to buy now and that btc’s best times are over. People are stupid.

Daily volume can’t be compared to a $1bn BUY. Volume can easily be created without buying any btc. It only means shifting btcs from a to b to c to a and voila here is your volume without having bought.

Of course btc is manipulated, the market is still tiny and a lot of investors use this chance to ride up and down as long as it’s possible. But how btc works is incredible. If you would understand the principles of bitcoin you would think different about it. 
I do agree with what you’re saying about alts though....

If you can’t afford a hardware wallet you probably only invested a tiny bit, which is fine. Just store your seed in a safe place and don’t lose it.
Cryptothiefes check the balances of the accounts they want to get in before they actually do it, in your case it’s probably not worth it for them anyway. So just keep your seed safe and as soon as your investment is worth more get yourself a ledger or trezor (starting at around 70€)!
@_date: 2019-01-05 12:05:35
You are right that the blockchain itself is fully transparent, but it’s up to you how you wanna use bitcoin. Nothing easier than creating a wallet which isn’t connected to any kind of your ID (no personal information, no IP). Yes, they can always see your transaction ID and the balance in your hot wallet, but that’s it. Also, you can’t compare a hot wallet to your normal wallet, or do you run around with all your bank account’s money in your pocket? You are saying that it’s worse than using the bank system, dude, think about all the data you are leaving behind, every time you pay with your cards ;) So no dramas here please....

The main provider of most of the ATMs (Coinfinity) in Austria, charges a 3-4% fee. That’s pretty good, considering you can buy anonymously for purchases up to 250€, plus it’s the fastest and easiest way. 
But i totally agree with you that 10-15% is way too much and yes, this can piss newcomers off... Which city or country are you talking about?

If transactions are made through lightning network, it will probably only help to identify the receiver. Because LN transactions are routed through the system, the receiver can’t tell if the sender adress is actually the sender or just a router....

That’s just for security reasons because cc fraud is so big everywhere around the globe. They don’t want us to end up in embarrassing situations, but it’s the only way for them to secure our accounts/money. 
Don’t want to protect the banks here, just saying that without all those security settings all our money would already be gone a long time ago ;) Sooo yeah, time for a change! Bitcoin (or cryptos in general) can do a much better job!
