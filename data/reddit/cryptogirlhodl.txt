That's pretty cool, but this guy called Crypto Rap Up has been rapping about crypto and it's ongoings for a while now. He's pretty good and his lyrics are fun to listen to, and he could definitely use more support, subscribers and views for the quality work he delivers: 
I don't get how Crypto Rap up hasn't been featured all over the place yet.

Much more interesting than I thought it would be. He's got a lot of good points and insights

What a bumbling, stumbling old fool..
I've never heard George Soros speak yet but now that I have heard him stumbling and fumbling about for 3-4 minutes saying what could be said in 15 seconds, he hasn't quite convinced me.
If these are the people we are up 'against', then I'm not all that worried.

There are many things that alts can do that Bitcoin won't be doing ever..

YES! I completely agree Bitcoin needs it's own standardized emoji. I am so tired of using the graph and/or currency exchange symbols, not to mention the absurdity of using dollar-emoji's to describe gains in Bitcoin!

Why is a Bitcoin priced in dollars, instead of dollars being priced in Bitcoin?
If we want true adoption, this is something that should be taken care of.

Thanks for this, I feel better now. HODL on, HODL on, 'cause the price today doesn't matter.

There are a bunch of universal basic income projects in crypto which fit well within some leftist views. Additionally one might argue that earning tokens through crypto is a powerful way to lift poor people in 3rd world countries out of poverty (earning a couple extra dollars means a lot to these people - it could double their income).
Additionally blockchain solves: identity fraud, fake money fraud, voting-fraud, and more. It helps track refugees and ensures that fair trade products are fair.
Yes, it's mostly altcoins and not BTC. But BTC is the prime mover in this story; altcoins would not exist/have no value without BTC's PoW

This is also the same wallet that uses coinjoin by default, correct?
Is there any news yet on whether or not using it puts my BTC at risk of being 'tainted'? 
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:25:22
I too would like to know these things. It would be really great if somebody could answer these point by point... It would help a lot!

I have my funds in a hardware wallet safely locked away.
However, I also want to have/use a hot wallet paired to my mobile phone so I can also *spend* instead of just hodl. I don't trust non-hardware wallet solutions, yet I am willing to accept a lower security since it's a hot wallet.
What is the safest/most user friendly option out there for me? Are there more than average risks involved with having a mobile wallet as opposed to a desktop one? 
I would prefer to use a hardware wallet on my hot wallet too, but consider them to be too expensive for the use-case so I am open to hearing other suggestions.

I don't need a fiat on-ramp, so does that mean Zap suits my needs right now? I'll check it out, thanks

is there a proper non-custodial Lightning Network wallet for Android yet? I'd love to give LN a try finally, but I never did find a wallet that I liked before. Thanks in advance!

Here is the best advice I've discovered when it comes to investing in crypto: When in doubt, do 50/50.
This goes for anything.. when to buy, when to sell, what to buy and what to sell. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Tell him to buy 50% NVDA stock and 50% crypto, so he can compare the two.

Ever since Roger Ver got controversial, Mike Novogratz has been picking up the slack and doing a much better job at it.

I am concerned also. 
I think Wasabi wallet sounds very interesting with this feature, but I too worry about how much privacy is gained and how much of a chance there is that my BTC will become 'tainted' instead.

Localbitcoins.com ?

What are the odds that by using Wasabi's coinjoin that the coins get 'tainted' in the future?

Giancarlo's niece is the *real* hero here. She probably explained many things to her uncle. Someone should track her down on social media, and somehow get some BTC donations going her way. 
Seems like the crypto thing to do. She's a true hodler, too.

How does one prove ownership of a Bitcoin address? If I give it to someone else, how do I prove that it's not simply a secondary address that I own?

The future? I'm already here and have been since 2013.
I'm sick of people saying there are no women in the space.. There are, look around, I've encountered plenty of likeminded women. It's no different than other computer-related fields. Are we *really* back to the 'there are no gurls on the internet' days? I was so glad we were past that.

Very cool artwork! Do you do requests? I would very much love some kind of Bitcoinized 'last supper' artwork (guess who gets to be Judas). Or perhaps something along the lines of this pic (which I actually had printed on canvas and have hanging on my wall): 
(try to spot how many people you recognize)
If you could make something like that, but with all the important figures in crypto I'd be very interested in buying (as long as affordable - rather poor IRL)! And I believe others would like it too.

I didn't know about coinmap.org so I checked it to see what stores I could buy stuff with my Bitcoin locally (Netherlands). Unfortunately, the websites of the majority of stores that I checked were no longer in operation.
It would be great if Lightning Network enabled some kind of 'ping' function which would let you ping a merchant to see if their operation is still live. This could be a very cool feature IMO, and it would allow sites like coinmap to offer a live map that's always up to date
