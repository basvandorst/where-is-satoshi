Eventually they can be holding over a trillion dollars in today's wealth for people.

Coinbase pools all the user coins the same way a bank does with your deposits, you just get an IOU.  If they start investing that into other things like the banks do and they happen to give out bad bitcoin loans is it possible the government needs to step in to protect the users one day?

A good time to shake these weak hands and send them over to bcash.

Same but my time horizon is hundreds of years though.  Think about your great great grand kids when purchase this asset.  This has the possibility to make your family wealthy for generations, don't waste it on a Lambo.

It probably would of been easier just to see him in Chicago.

More sustained growth over 100 weeks.  In 2013 bitcoin went up 10x in about a month.  Crappy centralized alt coins that can easily be attacked are not competition.  I believe fees and Coinbase changing their merchant program affected adoption, lighting network should help this.  ETF should also be coming soon.  Fundamentals have never been stronger.

I think we have different definitions of competition.

History doesn't predict future.  Don't forget that in 2014 the biggest exchange went bye bye and everyone thought Bitcoin was done.  I've never been more bullish on Bitcoin and institutions will start being ready to buy in the fall.  This recovery will be much faster, hodl tight!

Sure you can play that game and maybe outperform bitcoin in the short term but long term 99% of these will die.  I suspect the smart people will have most of their value in BTC.

I try to keep the same emotion whether it's increasing or dropping by large percentages and look at the big picture.

I think we'll see that late this year.

Why are they going to the bank if they bought Bitcoin?

It doesn't seem like he misses many lunches.

More like this time next year.  2018 is the start of Wall Street and the 1% getting in.

Thanks, Bitcoin has been amazing to me.  This is my way of giving back, if it helps one person then it's worth it.

Alot faster.  I'm trying to get more bitcoin at the end of the day.  Sometimes I trade an alt-&gt;alt and when the time is right I trade it back to bitcoin and get more than what I would.  This helps me get more bitcoin.

It gives you the average ratio over the last year and last month along with the current ratio.  You're able to see very easily if you're getting a good trade based only on the historical ratio.

Yes, also planning on adding alerts that you can setup when trading pairs reach a certain threshold.  I like trading when I have at least a 30% increase over the yearly average.

I'm not aware of any site that has this all on one screen between all coin pairs. I was looking for it and couldn't find it so I built it.
