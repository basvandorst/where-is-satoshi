Yeh, you can. You just have to have something going for you. The most attractive men (the 0.01%) buy it with looks alone... women can tell that the genetics give her offspring advantage.
Likewise the strongest. Or those with specific talents. In a pinch, they'll even go after those who are stable (have a place of their own, manage to keep a steady job, don't wig out or abuse drugs).
If you're having trouble, we can sympathize that you don't have Hollywood looks or Olympic athleticism or that you're not a violin virtuoso. 
But why the fuck can't you manage the last one?

That's not investing. It's speculating. Investment is when you spend money on the expectation of returns. Dividends, growth, whatever.
There are no dividends here and never will be. Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. The only possible way that it might be worth its current astronomical prices would be if it had a chance to become a real currency, which the speculation-fueled bubble rules out categorically.

It works. You've just never tried it.

Renting an efficiency isn't what I'm talking about. It needs to be more than "hey I'm not homeless and living under a bridge".

Follow it to the bottom.

So, you have $120k worth of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency whose claim to fame is the lack of need for banks.
And you put it in a bank. Well, a not-really-a-bank. Gee, no one could have seen this coming.

If you actually like bitcoin, how could $10,000 ever be a good thing?

If you're doing something where you don't want your name attached to the domain...
Then why would this be an issue? The whole point is that when they do yank the domain that they then don't have your name to level civil or criminal proceedings against you.

The point that the rich and powerful will always be "qualified" because they don't have to play by the rules?
I believe that was my point.


You can't decree such. The past is fixed. Unless you're suggesting they have the ability to travel in time, then when he was born he was not a citizen, and that can't be changed.

It's misused. If you retroactively make something legal, it means that you won't prosecute for those incidences that happened prior to the advent of the law.
You can't make history retroactively different than it is though. This isn't a matter of belief, it's a matter of plain fact.

But it's never done that before! That means it can't happen.
@_date: 2012-09-05 23:01:22


That sentence is semantically meaningless.

I do, but you don't want to listen. An idiotic judge or an idiotic law can declare that some red things are really blue... but it doesn't change reality.
If you say that he really was a citizen from birth, despite the fact that he was demonstrably not, you've done two things.
1. You've lied.
2. You've taken a rather circuitous route to not-quite-saying "while normally we only allow natural born citizens to be President, this time we're going to ignore our own rules".
The Supreme Court has no legitimate power to ignore reality. If they do, then they've only demonstrated why they themselves should be ignored.

McCain wasn't born on US soil nor was he a citizen at birth. The law affirming him a citizen wasn't passed until he was 3.
I think that it will eventually be interpreted that rich powerful people always meet the qualifications for office.

Definitely need to buy high now so you can sell low for the next 3 years.

The higher bitcoin goes, the lower its utility. If utility is the only thing that makes it worthwhile, who in their right mind would ever want to buy in? Even without the bubbling, its utility is pretty low... it's been mismanaged to hell and it's unlikely to be repaired any time soon.
