Lemme tell you about Bob. Now Bob is a kiwi with a lot of great ideas. One day he discovers an old farm going for cheap and decides to buy it and raise pigs. Trouble is the council hasn't cleared the road for 60 years because that's how long since it was last used.
"No problem", says Bob. He approaches the council and makes a proposition. "If I clear the roads will you guys give me a break on the kind of buildings I can erect there?" They went for it wholeheartedly, since it cost them nothing and the farm, being remote, could easily fly under the radar on the subject of building standards.
So out intrepid farmer buys a bulldozer and grades the roads. Then he builds a house and some sheds and a dam for water and starts raising pigs and after a while he starts to make a bit of money, and life is looking pretty good.
The council, seeing that the value of the property has now improved dramatically, raises his land taxes (rates) to the point where the whole venture is no longer profitable. In fact if Bob hadn't discovered a 100yo Kauri log stuck in the creek he would have gone broke.
Bob dragged that log out of the creek, it took him weeks. He used chains and blocks and almost broke his bulldozer but eventually it was up on high ground. With a chain saw and a lot of determination he cut that log down and made the keel for a really nice boat.
I'd like to tell you he built that boat and fucked off into the wide blue yonder, but in fact he sold that keel for a very large amount of money, then got rid of the farm and went off into the Pacific to fly aeroplanes for a living.
True story.

It would probably stablize that country's currency by negating the effect of inflation. But since that will happen merely due to the presence of Bitcoin in the economy whether banks accept it or not, the nett effect is zero.
In other words, there's nothing the status quo can do, we already won this game and their old world is on the way out. Byeeee.

It's a scam all right. Launches on 1st Oct but so far they have missed the deadline to allow potential investors to preregister and don't have their contract code visible.
There are no identified people or companies but serious participation by many Russians and Ukranians; main office is in Singapore but they will be licenced in the Channel Islands.

What a bullshit article. This has been the de-facto treatment for GST purposes for at least a year. In addition the comparison with the $600 US limit for record keeping is a complete non-sequitur, since Australia treats purchases under $10k as exempt as long as they are for private use, which is unrelated to GST altogether.
CGT still applies to amounts over this figure, or to any amounts earned with the intention of investment or business purposes.

4% is the going rate, whether you use an ATM or bitsquare P2P. Localbitcoin is usually more like 7-10% and not secure at all.
You might get better rates on an exchange but it will be something like half the spread + 1% which is still close to 2% most days.

Not at all. The difference is that this time the game is outside the zero-sum forex system and has a chance of succeeding. Every exchange I've used was rigged in some way, and there were quite a few.
I don't have anything against USD per se but any currency that supports a national debt of $13.6 trillion and is used to generate war machinery probably needs to be put out of its misery. But I won't underestimate its strength, "they" haven't yet begun to fight.

Use your brain. I got stuck with a small amount of BTC in an exchange yesterday. I converted in to Reddcoin and sent it to another exchange where I sold it for BTC again. That combined with the larger amount I already had there made it a usable amount.
There's always a way.

Doesn't matter, you can't withdraw from Coinbase anyhow.
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:22:47
If you want to collect BCC after 1st August you will need to control the keys. Best practice is to have your coins on a hardware wallet such as Ledger Nano S. If you don't have one try Electrum Cash.
Do it early, CoinJar will probably close trading on 31 July at 4pm (AEST) according to their mailings.
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:38:05
You did good. Nobody should pay CC interest rates.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:39:56
The limit is the equivalent of USD2500 per day. You're probably trying to withdraw too much at one time. Their interface doesn't make this clear at all.
