Normally it would take not longer than ~10 minutes. If there are too many transactions, the miners can't process all transactions in the blockchain at once and they will most likely chose the ones with the highest transaction fees. This is likely to happen more and more in the near future.

Posted this in another thread as well:
I got a theory for the corrections, which pretty much fit the data: at the end of each quarter major (investment) companies and/or exchanges are selling their cryptos to add a gain in their reports or to cash in their collected trading fees and add liquidity.
Close to the end of every quarter (March, June, September and now December) there's a price correction. I think it's not a coincidence.
Just keep holding if you're not planning on making a quarterly report for your investors. Chances are big the price will be rising above ATH in the next weeks.

I own both a ledger and a trezor and can only agree with this post. Do not risk your cryptos getting lost due to bad security (either yours or 3rd party).
Best thing: after a fork, the wallets provide a way to claim the forked coins (Bcash and Bgold)...

Except that it's not out there... I could write a White paper claiming 10 billion transactions per second. That doesn't mean I could also in fact build that system... or when...
So far, Bitcoin is coming to a limit, which might be good for miners, off-chain 3rd parties and some others, but not for the common Bitcoin users. I want to use Bitcoin because it's an independent alternative to cash (with all other advantages). I don't mind paying a bit more on a transaction, but I should still be able to buy a beer without having to pay a 10% fee. That's the risk on a longer term (or whenever Bitcoin will see another boom).

3rd or 4th biggest newspaper (NRC) had an article online yesterday, saying more or less the same thing.

They quoted Banco Santander saying banks could save billions of euro's each year using the Blockchain.

On the one hand I completely agree with you, and hope they somehow find themselves losing a lot of money on it. On the other hand: they do it, because they can. They might just use the system for a political reason, or for personal gain. Either way, just because they can means there's something not right in the technology.
I know I'm buying on Monday! If the price drop doesn't happen, they showed their point spending a lot of money.

My SO recently booked flight tickets with credit card. It costs 2*€5 on processing fees (2 single tickets). 
Then the other day we bought something online across the border, worth about €25. Since the other nation used another currency, we had to pay a €13 exchange fee. That's a 50% fee!
Two examples where I had wished for a wider Bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2015-06-02 20:09:39
It will. I think there are not that many people who've touched Bitcoin and then stopped being interested at all. 
There are some buttcoiners who are either jealous, paid shells or just have nothing better to do. On the other hand more and more people are getting interested in bitcoin and start using it. They accumulate bitcoins over time.
So in the end, seen the halving every ~4 years,  it's just a matter of time when the average demand becomes bigger than the supply of new coins. I am very optimistic on the long run. The only fear* I have is a major fuck up along the way. As long as that doesn't happen, I don't worry that much about tomorrow's price.
Edit: great into fear

As a Bitcoin user, a small blockchain size (1MB) and many (expensive) transactions would force me to use 3rd parties to do transactions. In the end, this could and would lead to centralisation of transaction processors. It wouldn't be much different from PayPal or Visa. Expensive transactions make the centralisation of payment/transaction services more realistic.

@_date: 2015-06-08 15:08:31


I would give it a little bit longer. [The next halving]( is expected at the end of July 2016 (~13 months), at that point the monetary inflation of Bitcoin will be significantly decreased, ergo: the same amount of fiat invested in Bitcoin will increase the price of Bitcoin if all other factors are unchanged.
Of course some price adjustments will probably be visible before the halving, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price would stay pretty much stable over the next 10 months.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:39:14
Only for those who know it's not coming as a surprise... wait until the media starts writing about it endlessly in early 2016.

I always see Bitcoin as more real than fiat currencies or other valued papers, because I know that in the end those can be manipulated and the value can truly be different than expected. True, Bitcoin's price may be volatile (even though you wouldn't say, looking at the last months), but at least it's very clear what the value of it is. As it can't be counterfeited and no central organisation can secretly alter value, it's as real/hard as is gets.
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:03:52


Rules of physics? Those are beyond human control. Consensus has everything to do with human control. Lowering gravity can't be legislated, because people can't change it. The blockchain size can actually be changed, if people are willing to change it.
I think the whole problem is that the more people are involved, the less chance of consensus. This could be a good thing (not being able to change fundamental things), but when change is needed, it's horrible: even a 99% majority couldn't change it, because the 1% doesn't allow a consensus.
Therefore, I think the supermajority rule (&gt;75% + time to adjust) would come in handy in situations like these. One could argue about the percentage of the majority (80-90%), but in the end it means that not a handful of developers make the change, a supermajority of the network does.
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:14:36
True, but it's uncertain if and when that will happen. The halving is something that will 100% certainly occur, and it is even very predictable (~29th of July). Therefore, it's better to wait for, say, 18 months to draw the conclusion of being no good store of value than the 10 months you mentioned earlier.
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:21:43


Bitcoin gets part of its value from the fact someone is able to exchange it for something else (buying stuff and services). So actually, as a hoarder you should also care about it being accepted (mainstream or in bigger niches).

On the other hand, it would be interesting to see what really happens when the number of transactions outnumber the blocksize. Maybe it will take away all discussion, and makes finding consensus easier.

Thanks, my thoughts exactly! Unfortunately I'm just a simple Bitcoin user, without operating a mining farm or even a node. But I support the way Gavin is doing it (changes only apply when 75% agrees it should), and the fact he is doing something!
Those messages are clearly just to mess with those who are not 100% convinced yet, but know something needs to happen. It's quite sad...
The question for me is: how can simple bitcoin users like me show their support for this fork? If it's not for this fork, Bitcoin might become uninteresting for us, since it could become too expensive to deal directly with the blockchain. After all, Bitcoin was our alternative for doing transactions without 3rd party or middleman...

There might be a contradiction between points 1 and points 2,3 and 4.
Either there will be a deflation and speculators will sell big parts of their bitcoins, or there will be mainstream acceptance and speculators will hold on longer, or sell bitcoins at smaller chunks (the amount of bitcoins bought by newcomers &gt;= amount being sold by speculators).
If point 1 is true, the price will drop (quickly) and rise (maybe as quickly since other investors think it's time to buy), which doesn't provide stability for bigger merchants to accept bitcoins.
I think the so called 'whales' hold on to their cheaply bought/mined bitcoins and release them in small parts to spread the risk of losing too much at a time or missing a huge increase in the future. So the price will probably float around the current price for a longer time (between €450 - €650), yet bitcoins will be used and accepted as form of payment by more people/organisations.
I hope you're right about point 4, that's one of the biggest obstacles for bitcoin for reaching general acceptance.

As I see it, you have a key that enables to *alter* a sort of  'database'-entry. Sending bitcoins is changing a number here and adding it there (with a timestamp and some other info). Only those who know the specific key to a specific entry which is not zero have the right to do that.
You can only prove you have that key by 'moving' bitcoin and therefore altering the entry. You don't **own** anything...

Because this technology contains a value. Some people have a bigger 'share' in this technology than others, which makes it easier for people without any share to call it something it is actually not at all (scam / pyramid scheme / ponzi).
Part of that is the incompetence to comprehend such new technology (most mass media and mass media influenced opinions), part is pure jealousy that some people actually got very rich for being an early adopter (most buttcoiners). 
Then there's a small group that doesn't like the status quo to change (rest of the buttcoiners), just like the record industry in general is not very fond of MP3 and downloading/streaming. Even though that is already changing.

Price is one way to look at it, but it doesn't say everything about bitcoin.
I suggest to also look at the [number of transactions]( and [number of Bitcoin addresses used]( and you'll see a whole other graph. There's no decline there, on the contrary.
Reasons of price drops can be many:
* People buying Christmas gifts or donating money (as many do around this time a year), merchants/organisations exchange bitcoin to fiat immediately
* People selling, so that it's easier to do the tax applications (rebuying in January?)
* Whales selling to manipulate the market
Probably dozens of other reasons can be found. I'm not in there to cash quick. I exchange small amounts at a time and either hold, experiment with different services ([Bitreserve]( might be interesting if you fear further volatility on a short term) and spend those bitcoins.
I am very curious what happens in January 2015, and the rest of the year. I think there are too many people involved in Bitcoin to lower the price any further, and as soon as there's some substantial rise of price, it will catch the interest of many more people and media.
@_date: 2014-05-14 10:14:28
Saw a graph here yesterday that 76% of Americans do not know what bitcoin is. Now we can all discuss about how correct this survey was and how those statistics represent the real population etc. but to call bitcoin mainstream is a bit too early.
Surely there are people who deliberately are not using bitcoin, probably even more people who have no clue what they can do with it, what benefit it has or how to get them (not to mention, how to handle them). I don't think bitcoin is as revolutionary as the internet, but I think in terms of acceptance it follows similar steps. First, you'll need to have quite some technical skills and sight and it's unclear what it does for you. People having read articles about the internet in the early 90's and even forming an early opinion about it, doesn't mean one can fully understand the way it works and the advantages on a long term.
I guess we can really call bitcoin mainstream if a majority of the people have a slight idea of how bitcoin works. Your conclusion is too premature.

Just the amount of people making use of bitcoin. If 10x more people use bitcoin, probably the number of places to spend increases tenfold, ten times the number of investors. That's a logical upward spiral.
The other possibility: people sell, and sell, and sell... before the price drops further. No trust, shops/services back off, bitcoin is used just marginally on this site to tip others ;)
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:03:26
I'd use Circle as a hot wallet. Just like my computer and smartphone, I expect something to go wrong in a way I'd lose all bitcoin. In the worst case scenario I would lose (control of) less than 1 BTC.
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:38:40
That would be a negative commercial. Maybe an ad should focus more on the positive sides of Bitcoin, in stead of the negative ones of other payment options. I think the people who are sick and tired of data branches and who actually care already know all about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-16 07:49:25
In the past they have been writing utterly bad (and bad written) articles about Bitcoin. Mostly it's freelance writers that pretend to have some knowledge, which obviously they don't. This used to be my 1st source of news, but since they failed in writing decent articles on Bitcoin, I started doubting about their expertise in all other news and stopped reading their site completely.

It depends on acceptance, adoption, other players joining (banks, wallstreet, Western Union). 
And in early 2016 the mining revenues will halve again: at this moment approximately 3600 new units of bitcoin are mined each day. From 2016 on it will be 1800, thus lower the supply.
Have 0.01 BTC to see the changes in price. I often check [BitcoinAverage]( @_date: 2014-07-07 11:05:36

I don't know the average price of my bitcoins, I don't care that much... I didn't spend more than I could lose, and for me it already changed my way of thinking about money in such a way that I don't regret buying in high.
Of course I hope to see the price rise somewhere soon, but either way I will keep some and don't regret. I bought them for way more than just a fiat investment.

You will not change his view for now. Just hold on to them, maybe buy your dad a present with it, explaining you bought it with Bitcoin. Maybe show him how a payment is done (and how easy it is over other payment methods).
Dependent on how many bitcoins you have, time will tell if it was a good/bad investment. We probably all think it's a good one, but the older generations might think it's better to invest in oil/gold/stocks/etc instead.

Although the prices are a bit higher, I have had some good experiences. If you want to be sure, buy from high rated sellers (100%, 100+). Best not to change for cash, nor use paypal. Just bank transfer will do (in Europe it takes 1 day).

This was the reason to stop being interested in Mycelium. To me it seems very amateuristic and has too much of a 'I use Bitcoin to buy psychedelic drugs'-look. It also has a strong negative message (towards other money), rather than a strong positive one (towards bitcoin).
Besides, a hippie that has shiny bitcoin signs in her eyes (they will be worth much more!!) seems very hypocrite for a hippie.

I am very happy with [Electrum]( but it depends a bit on how you want to use them. I would say, test some out with just a few bits and once you decide, move all the bits to the one/two you like most.
Important: you should have control of the private key. Some online wallets control your private key which is potentially dangerous to your holdings (see Mt.Gox)

It will go up AND down... Just use a fraction, check the price regularly and then after a while you might have an idea of what price-ranges a bitcoin has. Then decide to buy more or not.
My personal opinion: it could go down a bit, price will stick at this price for a longer period, eventually it will go up.

Keep up the network. Even when the mining itself isn't very profitable, keeping the network up and running will be one of the most important tasks for anyone accepting bitcoin.
However, if bitcoin takes off, even smaller amount of mining rewards could become profitable somehow. By the time the block size becomes ~1.5 BTC, that might be worth much more than 100BTC is at this very moment. Mass adoption will increase the total of transaction fees as well.

Circle, but so far only to people with an account...
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:19:02
I'll just name some that apply to me personally:
* As a European customer, I can buy/subscribe/donate worldwide. Assuming I already have bitcoin
* I can easily financially support (digital) work I appreciate, without paying a middleman
* I can pay without giving away personal details. I know it's not completely anonymous, but even if the payment details are leaked or stolen, it will be close to impossible to trace my name, address, bank account, phone number. Only some governments or really good hackers could probably find trace this info.
* I have control over my money. Of course many feel the same with online banking or PayPal, but I am aware that the money in those accounts can be frozen or altered at any time.
* Paying friends or family (or actually anyone) directly. If I make a payment now, they will see it a second later.
There are not so many more incentives for the general public I suppose. In general most people are satisfied with the old ways, because they know how it works and it, more or less, always worked until now. That's why I think not many people change the way they deal with money and bitcoin will be more of an evolution than a revolution. People need time for new technologies, and the infrastructure around it needs time to be built.
Once OpenBazaar is up and running and easy accessible for the public there will be another incentive to use Bitcoin. Once the online gambling industry sees the possibilities of Bitcoin, there will be an incentive to those who like to gamble. Once micropayments will be [integrated into the HTTP-protocol]( there will be more incentives for people to get a wallet and use Bitcoin.
However, I think at this time Bitcoin is mostly used by people who have a strong liberal or anarchistic political view (political ideologists), people who hope to get rich (either trade, hold or invest in start-ups) and people who need to pay others overseas and want to do it in a fast, reliable and cheap way. 
Ah, and by drug users and terrorists of course!

2015 - Sure, Bitcoin has been accepted by most of the online shops and can be used for donations to almost every NGO worldwide, and sure, the security increased dramatically and acquiring bitcoin is easier as buying chewing gum, but I just miss the smell of real money.

1 internet for that! @_date: 2014-08-10 08:58:31
The good news is mostly some big organisation accepting bitcoin. Since they convert everything back to fiat, it's more likely that people try it out (Dell) or donate big amounts (Wikimedia), thus big amounts of Bitcoin are offered to the market, or at least end up with big companies like BitPay and Coinbase.
I think companies like BitPay and Coinbase are selling their bitcoins either outside the visible market and/or selling them slowly, at the same rate as people buy them back. Therefore the price will stay quite solid.

But in an electronic based fiat system, money can be created by some individuals or entities. That's what banks are doing all the time. Not even talking about possible double spending.
Why is having no physical bitcoins a downside? You could make something that represents a Bitcoin, then you have made the bitcoin physical. However, that would increase the risk of someone counterfeiting that.

Extrapolating the price from before October 2013 there has been a period where bitcoin might have been overrated (due to mainly good news). A more realistic price of bitcoin is between $200 - $400, which is the way the price is going (due to mainly bad news).
The new low comes after the IRS-outcome. You can see a huge peak in transaction volume on March 26th ( and a corresponding price drop. I guess some are selling in order not to add them to their report or to take and report their loss, others because they think everyone is selling.
I actually don't care too much about the price at this moment. I convert a percentage of my wage into bitcoin every month. Either the price is high and I get a little, or the price is low and I get more. Either way I win ;)
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:45:38
I think it will... Imagine 1 billion people using bitcoin. Imagine 15 million Bitcoins devided by 1 billion people.

I don't know what I would do in your situation, but I would consider a 50-50 option. You say it's either sell all or keep all, but maybe it would be an idea to sell like half of them and wait a bit with the rest to see what direction the price is going (is it really an all-time low, or will it sink deeper).
If the price decides to rise rapidly, you will not hit your head for selling all. If it decides to dive further, you can be happy to have sold half of them before the dive (and maybe buy twice as much when the price is on its return. There's enough potential to think bitcoin will stick around for a while).
Sorry, but that's the best 'advice' I could give you at this moment. I wish you all the best, and hopefully your worries will someday be memories to laugh about.

bitcoin will not solve poverty, nor will it prevent people from getting rich. To be super rich is only an advantage when you can also SPEND the money you have, otherwise there's no difference. So, the money will spread on the long run.
The very positive side would be that there will not be any permanently 'fictive' money, as all other currencies have. No one can create a couple of bitcoins out of nothing to profit from spending them first before inflation kicks in. Poor will not become slaves of money through unpayable debts, rich will not be able to double their money by lending it for crazy high interests (well, probably some systems will probably be created to continue this ridiculous habit).

It's my least favourite part of Bitcoin, this quick trade for quick bucks. I think it's part of the deal though. It will change, like you say, after halving and/or bigger adoption. But before that, people will only trust Bitcoin enough, if the price doesn't fluctuate all the time.
A wise man once said: hold!
@_date: 2014-10-25 12:05:19
I completely agree, yet it would be pleasant to see some long-term upwards spiral... This year it only went downwards. Of course some major problems like Mt.Gox were part of this, and maybe a lot of (early) miners cashed out some of their coins... still, for the acceptance of Bitcoin it would be good to either see some long term stability or raise in price.

The only solution for more stability is mass adoption, in combination with a next halving of the coin distribution (early 2016?).
Expect Bitcoin to be volatile for the next couple of years. Up to then, Bitcoin is not ready for the masses as an everyday, transactional currency.

You could make a wallet with a split key, so that someone needs 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 4 keys to move the bitcoins.
You can hold one key, and spread the other 2 or 3 over people you trust, but are not (necessarily) directly connected with each other.
In case the value of Bitcoin drops, because of adoption of a bitcoin alternative, for example, you could still get your money out of bitcoin, even when you have no internet connection. You would have to trust the others for 100% though...

You only need to make more money when the currency is inflationary. If the currency however is deflationary, you don't need to 'make' more money to keep the same wealth, just keep it.
You could still open a bakery if there's need for one or if baking bread is your hobby though. Just save up the money, or get it invested by others, and open the thing independently from a 5% interest loan.

US dollar crypto coin would only be trusted by the US government and maybe its banks. There's no way to guarantee it's stability and all control will be in the hands of the US government. If I were another nation, I would not trust that coin, because it could be worthless as soon as the US governement decides it to be. Where is the (independent) network that guarantees the system working?
Also, volatility goes down as soon as more institutions, governments, corporations start using Bitcoin as a value transfer protocol. They have little need for immediate exchange, thus lowering supply and stabilizing price. This will **maybe** start happening in the next 3 years, but more likely integrated within some 5-10 years. By then the value of the network has been risen, thus making it possible to send bigger amounts of value, thus making it more interesting for bigger corporations and governments to use the protocol.

Maybe compare it with how people used to communicate in the past and now (from drums/smoke to smartphone communication). In that way it ends logically ("Bitcoin is the next step in money handling")
Another idea is to make a compilation of old material where people say computers are not made for households, the internet is blowing over and mobile phones are just another hype. And then some more recent material of people diminishing Bitcoin. It would show that revolutionary ideas and technology are not always accepted from day 1.

The negative view comes from people that either:
- are jealous of not understanding how to get Bitcoins (or frustrated they didn't buy any 2 years ago)
- are conformists and/or conservative in ways of habbits/technology
- have read a lot of negative news about bitcoin, therefore have a negative view on the protocol
So far I've only bought bitcoins for a higher price than the current (therefore would lose some Euro's if I would sell all of my fractions). Still I think bitcoin is a great idea, greatly executed and has a whole lot of potention.
You don't use a real wallet either, because you're afraid of losing it? Your bank has its data stored somewhere as well, which could get lost. Making SAFE back-ups and/or paper wallets and/or spreading your fractions over different addresses can help in spreading the risks. There are great sites for that:

I think the price of 1 BTC will rise slowly. The more places people can spend bitcoin, the more media coverage, the more exchanges converting technology to understandable terms (Circle), the more people will try it out and see how easy it is to pay with bitcoin.

After reading a rather 'sensational' 'news'-item on an 'economics' website about the recent value drop of Bitcoin, I was thinking: the value is similar to the one 3 months ago, but the amount of Bitcoins has been increased with 400.000.

3. It's easier to donate in Bitcoin than bank or credit card
4. Bitcoin could raise in value over time. Deciding to hold on to Bitcoin if you can, **could** mean an increase of funds (you might have to check the legal status on holding Bitcoin as a non-profit)

I think you're right in one thing: Bitcoin doesn't need a middleman and does things so efficient, that many start-ups will have a hard time creating revenue. I would not be surprised if some of them cease to exist in 2015. That however can also be seen as some selection and strengthening of the entire Bitcoin infrastructure... 
It all depends on which companies go bankrupt and mostly how: do people lose coins, were the companies essential for many users (coinbase, bitpay, blockchain.info, Circle, etc.)?
 Let's see what 2015 brings us! Any way, it will be exciting for anyone following Bitcoin..

If the actual content creator would put an address within the content, I would be happy to donate just as much as I think the content was worth. However, this not being the case and the music/film industry still holding strong to old business models.
I don't need more plastic discs laying around, taking up space. There is no serious streaming service in the country where I live, and no alternative to chose from. 90% of the cinemas have their movies dubbed, which makes hearing iron scraping iron, or nails on a blackboard more pleasant than the actual movie.
If just those creators could give me their Bitcoin-addresses, I would not feel the urge to download so many music/movies without contributing them.

Like I said, paying is not the problem... it's the lack of supply which is the problem, and the money not ending up with the creator. I don't want to pay for the plastic and the shipping, I want to pay for the creation itself! I don't want to pay the shareholders of production companies, but the actors, directors, musicians and whatnot.
I don't consider myself stealing, since I don't take away any original. It's still in the hands of the creator. I copied it, which is all different. But you wouldn't seem to understand such difference, I'm afraid.
Music is a much better example. By copying music, I have been introduced to hundreds of new artists. Although I don't buy their CDs (any more), I still visit concerts frequently, buy merchandise now and then. This would never ever have happened, if I had to buy a CD without hearing any of the artist's music. Of course I could pay Apple to listen to music, but you and I know very well that just a handfull of cents will end up with the artists.
You can of course do as you want, and maybe someday someone will give you a golden medal for all the copies of the works you've purchased.

They would dig their own technological grave. Actually any country banning this invention could have a great disadvantage in a couple of years.
Since the Western world is about to boycott the Russian economy, their only income would be those of 'slave states' like Belarus and Kazakhstan on the one hand and China that wants to give away their money all over the world to collect it in a later stadium on the other.
But then, I couldn't care less. I think in the 21st century development is a (political) choice. As long as the population doesn't change or take over government, it's pretty much their responsibility.

wouldn't call it artificial interest necessarily. It's in my interest to be able to spend bitcoins at a wide range of sites and branches. Even if I'm not interested in booking a hotel at this very moment, there might be a day I am. Accepting bitcoin would be one reason to book a hotel through that particular website and not any other one.

1a) smaller fees. Those bus companies are competing extremely on their prices, so every 2-3% they can save on transaction costs is very positive for them.
1b) I find it rather complicated/pain-in-the-ass to buy a train ticket on the site of Deutsche Bahn (needing to prove it's you who's buying, including bank pass number or ID number).
I still don't like travelling by bus, but accepting bitcoin would make me consider booking a bus for travelling within Germany.

What they do is creating acceptance. I am mainly interested in using Bitcoin. If that means the end user, or company in this case, changes that Bitcoin back to fiat, so be it! I am just happy I could pay for their services/products using Bitcoin...
I think once the price of one BTC will start rising substantially, more of those companies will start holding a (small) percentage of those coins, since I think it's pretty easy to adjust with a payment processor like BitPay.

Not if you want to create uncritical and unethical buying zombies, no.
Consumerism also has a direct ecological impact. Since the earth and its resources are finite, consumerism will almost by definition use everything it can, for the cheapest price possible (price is most important here, because the more you safe on one thing, the more you can spend on another one). When ethics come in second, spoils and environmental catastrophes are serving consumerism. It's often cheaper to dump waste than to deal with it properly (recycling/upcycling).

If you don't expect 100's of customers paying with Bitcoin every day, and you're in your shop yourself, just use an app, like [Mycelium](

You can find several pre-given monikers on [changetip]( You can also write down just an amount in dollars or euro's, use bitcoin-amounts (like the satoshis I gave you, which is the smallest unit of bitcoin) or make your own.

Yeah, it was $1000+ for less than a week. Everything above $200 between October 2013 and April 2014 was a bit overvalued by the hype. IF it will, the investment will carry its fruits on the long run, not in matter of weeks. Those days are over...

In a nation where someone has to pay to use another Banks' ATM, where you can't pay for small amounts with a debit card without having to pay a (relatively) high transaction fee, where there's a gap of technologic implementations in day-to-day life (almost everything seems analogue, compared to neighbouring countries). To ban cash would mean all structures would collapse and put Germany into big problems.
First Bitcoin (and maybe other systems) need a full integration in monetary day-to-day transactions. Only then, one can seriously think of a cashless society.

Although this is just an ad for his own site, I can say it's an OK site to buy coins. They're very fast and reliable (so far). You'll pay around 2% more than the average price, but that includes transfer and processing costs.

It's not about the value, but about the idea. I would rather get a tiny tip from someone saying 'thanks' or 'i liked your comment' than to get nothing.
Tipping small fees can well be used to add something extra to such a comment (just like an upvote does something positive for most).
And remember, a lot of small tips are adding up in the end, with or without deflation.

Investing in a future doesn't necessarily mean something monetary with the goal of financial gain.
That aside, Bitcoin is a protocol, a payment method, a monetary system on its own... for some it's a (risky) investment. If you want to call the last bit a form of gambling, so be it. I wouldn't care too much about that $1.

Those are charts for outage of companies operating in the Netherlands. 3 of the top 10 are banks,  is the payment processor [iDeal]( which most/all Dutch use to pay online.
Several times a year there are serious malfunctions in their systems. At the moment of writing there's a big interruption of the systems of ING, one of the biggest banks in the Netherlands. And seen the [history]( it will not be their last one.
So, even with a good banking-network, easy to use and direct payment processor, there's still the huge problem of regular outage and malfunction.

@_date: 2014-02-08 14:34:27
Thanks for your answer. That would be an option, however:
1. Converting bitcoin back to another kind of credit doesn't make much sense, otherwise I could also just pay with my bank or paypal account.
2. I'm not having/using bitcoins to support multinationals that take a shit on their own people. I'd rather buy it from an independent shop and pay a bit more.
I would be happy for an Amazon to accept bitcoin, but only for the fact that it would be an acknowledgement for the currency, and a change towards permanent general acceptance.

@_date: 2014-08-22 17:31:02
I think you could still be an early adopter at this point... The number of people having/using Bitcoin could be just a few million (hard to say how many exactly). On a world population, that's nothing.
@_date: 2014-12-21 21:55:38
In general, yes... I share that view on some extremely wealthy people. For example, if someone becomes filthy rich exploiting other people, I have no sympathy! Also some types of investments I find very unethical, and I despise people making shitloads of money with those.
That all does clearly not apply to Bitcoin. Since the acquirement of bitcoin is 100% voluntary, any money made with such investments can be seen as ethical and justified, imho.  
And yes, there are people getting rich through Bitcoin by scamming or (black hat) hacking. That's another form of unethical behaviour and is also condemned by me...

Hackers operate on weaknesses of end-users and security leaks of centralised exchanges/services. That has nothing to do with bitcoin as a protocol, which actually has built up a strong and secure reputation over the last years.

In Europe it will take your mum 1 day, through the SEPA-system.  
In the Netherlands (iDeal) and in Germany (Sofort) and probably some other countries, she could buy Bitcoin directly.
I agree with you however, that someone who needs to choose between a system they already know and a completely new form of payment, which can easily go wrong if you don't pay attention, will most likely pick the first one if the price is similar.
I think consumer adaptation will go slower than expected and would probably need some centralised service or advertised strategy to do so. Bitcoin still is very new however and we haven't seen the last of it. Maybe Bitcoin is not ready for our mums yet ;)

Because using the blockchain for internal use is useless. The power of this technology lays in the fact that it's decentralised and still verifiable for everyone.

There's probably a good use for Armory, but not for a simple mind like me...

Yes, of course!
I had been thinking of this being a good idea lately, didn't know there was actually an organisation for it. If they would accept Bitcoin, I would certainly donate... I hope that eventually they will send bitcoin directly. Even when their name is 'GiveDirectly', they're the middleman ;)

Could be... Volatility will be there for a while I guess. As long as someone with 10,000 bitcoins can drop the price with $10+, a storm could come up any time.
I still get the feeling that the price drops are getting smaller, the bottom has been reached and the price normally increases slightly in times of low trading activity.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:19:43
I just counted my donations in bitcoin last week. It was probably 3 or 4 times as high as I normally give away.
I think most influential:
* transparency
* global donation possible (choose between charities around the world)
* easy to donate
* small amounts possible (whereas credit card or paypal normally require a minimum)
* person to person
I love Bitcoin!

The dollar has proven stability and acceptance in the past, but it's not said that it won't change. The dollar can collapse as well, and the government will be unable to back everything (with what does the government back up the dollar actually?).
Please note that the dollar is printed / appointed by a private company an **not** the US government. Actually, commercial banks (privately owned) can create dollars out of thin air. That's a huge difference with the creation of bitcoins based on math.

So nothing would change? Everyone could still run a node if they wanted to. If it's not happening, it's not the fault of the code, but of the people using it


If the blocks are 10MB each (full!), around 500GB a year would be needed. With modern hard disks, you would still be able to store the blockchain for 5-10 years. By that time, storage has most likely increased and the price of storage decreased. Over the last 7 years, the blockchain gained 60GB. On my 2008 hard disk (8 years old), I could store the entire block chain almost 25 times!


Afaik, the miners need the support of nodes, but only hashpower can change the rules of Bitcoin. Look at the current situation: 25-30% of all nodes support Classic, yet only 5% of the miners support Classic. Even if 90% of the nodes support Classic, they will continue to register blocks mined by Core miners. The protocol (=rules) will not change. So, please elaborate on that myth.
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:31:45
All blocks seem to be full at this moment (and still 6000 transactions are in the waiting list), so then it depends on the fee if miners prioritize your transaction. Unfortunately, this will happen way more often in the near future.

Looking at [BitcoinAverage  it always shows a Bitcoin is more expensive in USD than in EUR (cross price: €217.50 vs. €213.89).
Is it because the currency values at BitcoinAverage are not working correctly, or is it really cheaper to buy a Bitcoin in Europe as it is in the US? If so, why is that and why doesn't the market close the gap automatically?

Depending on the amount, and on how much of it you would need to pay bills/groceries etc, I would say hold on to at least a part of the btc you got. Nobody knows where the bottom of the price is, but as long as Bitcoin works technically, it will have value. Chances are that the value increases over time.

I'm saying that strong government controlled currencies can also be volatile or at least lose/gain big value in short amounts of time. The funny thing is that almost no one notices it in their daily lives, because 1 EUR = 1 EUR and most people aren't directly involved with other currencies. Bitcoin has made me more aware of the currencies, their markets and their (relative) values.

Of course it's presenting the facts in a mere positive way. Just as some always refer to the top price of $1,000 (and then referring the current price as a loss of XX% to that) which didn't hold for more than 2 days.
One can't know the price tomorrow or next week, so this post could be translated as 'no big abrupt price changes over the last 4 months'.
And yes, I took exactly 4 months and not the beginning of the year, because this is what made me aware of it. I was looking at the 20th day of each month and found out the price was almost the same on January 20th. Stop being superserial...

Why would only few companies run full nodes? If Bitcoin is such a success that extremely high up/down speeds are needed, it would mean there are so many companies and organisations dependent on this technology that not just a few would run a full node.
Even then, it would still be thinkable that most broadband connections in (at least the western world) homes would be suitable for running a full node.
Where I live, a 40MBit/s upload speed is still quite cheap (~€30 / $40). Say I want to connect with 40 other nodes, in the worst case a block can be 1MBit/s. I would still be able to handle blocks over 50MB.
That's the infrastructure now. Once the blocks are 50MB, who knows how fast I can transfer them, how much my connection costs and in what countries they established affordable 40MBit/s upload speed broadband connections.
And in the end, it's not the nodes that decide on the rules, it's rather the miners who do. Your argument makes hardly sense.

There's a peak in November/December 2013 (due to price bubble) and one in March 2014 (Mt.Gox), but the graph will show an increase from ~$25,000,000 mid-2013, to $50,000,000 mid-2014. Lately, the average is around $75,000,000 and the overall trend is rising.

You're very optimistic, or maybe pessimistic in the popularity Bitcoin. It only has to hit once in the media (for example before or after the halving), and the ceiling will be hit hard. The week after, the media will talk about the incapabilities of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-18 22:59:01
Think about it this way: if Bitcoin will only be interesting to some big players, the chance of many full nodes will be less than when it's interesting or important to many smaller players. 
No need for altruism. If I deal with the blockchain directly, I might want to independently operate on it and run a full node myself. The incentive to run a node is inherent to the personal involvement and stakes in the technology. This only increases with many players.
@_date: 2016-03-18 17:51:59
It's a great idea, so it should be discussed here!
Then again, this is and 'less threatening' things have been removed in the past as well, so you never know.

Even though viruses may change the addresses after you click the send button, always check the last 6 characters of an address if it's copied correctly.
The first 2-20 may be very similar, but the last 6 are a checksum of the address, and even 1 changed character in the address changes these complete checksum (last characters of the address).
Good luck with your viruses...

Compare this graphic with the data from exchanges and you'll see way more activity takes place when the price is fluctuating heavily. 
Besides exchanges, people tend to move their coins when the price goes up (moving to cold storage, spreading hot wallets, actually pay for things). Spam attack is possible, but it's too easy to just call it that without more info...

I got out of Ethereum some time ago: too many forks, there are 2 versions of them already and every now and then a bigger problem with the code occurs. There's no guarantee that the blockchain you're dealing with is the same one tomorrow.
It's too complicated to handle. Bitcoin might not be noob-friendly, but Ethereum can only be done with quite some technical confidence. 
Ethereum could well work for some niche some day, but it will not gain big momentum and will never be some store of value. So I would only dive in there if you'd had technical interest. Just like some other altcoins provide interesting ideas and opportunities.

Of course value can be destroyed. Buy a mirror for $10 and smash it on the floor... that's something with the value $10 destroyed. Or would you argue that you could still sell every piece for $10/1000?
You could argue that you've traded $10 and that is still there, but I would say that you've transferred 2 things with the equal value and destroyed one, leaving only the other.
Value is not the same as the sum of all resources available. The earth and its resources are finite, value is subjective and theoretically infinite.

You could either have a web wallet or download wallet software (can recommend [Electrum](
Then you transfer them to there and/or send them to an exchange where you can receive your local currency for it (you're selling them your bitcoin for another currency) and let them send that to your bank account.
There are many more details and options, but those are the basics.
If you have the courage, you could also hold your bitcoins and see how much they're worth in a couple of years. In the early days, websites were giving away whole bitcoins, as they were cents at the time. Someone who waited 5 years received thousands of dollars for clicking a button on a website :) You might want to search for '*cold storage*' or '*paper wallet*'.

Maybe buy just a little bit ($100) to get the basics and see if you can safely store that amount. You don't want to lose $10,000 by not knowing exactly what you're doing or should do.

I've bought some at this same day, but I paid €158 or so. It raised immediately after (or was already on its way up).
Glad to see it has more than quadrupled since then :)
Edit: even my 'worst buy' was at €630 or so; so every BTC I ever bought has gained more value :) Wish I didn't spend so much in between...

Yes, but you would have to continuously do so to get an ever growing graph. You would lose some Bitcoin among the way. So, where's the advantage of doing so?

You should be able to get all your private keys using those 12 word seed using other software / wallet services as well.
It is advised not to store large amounts of Bitcoin on hot wallets, like breadwallet. Use cold storage or hardware to do so. I never keep more than 0.1BTC in a hot wallet (phone, desktop) at any time.

How can it be P2P cash if the blocks in the blockchain remain limited, so that either only financial institutions can use it, or me having to pay a fee which could be way higher than the value I want to transfer?
If only ~1000 transactions can be adopted in a block (=every 10 minutes), it would never be suitable for P2P cash. At least not for many people. Even when everyone uses Bitcoin once a week on average, it could only support around 1 million users.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:18:25
No need to subsidise the blockchain. It will be subsidised by expensive transfer fees if things don't change. Even when the niche group is still small, there's hardly anybody who first got their hands on Bitcoin to turn his back to it. Therefore, the usage will increase.


Only because there's so much money in it. That's why all those centralised mining farms started to exist. I think an increasing blockchain will add more balance in the mining business: if it's too expensive to mine on just the transaction fees, big farms will be outnumbered by smaller miners (who do it more for fun; have a main interest in strengthen the network). Once the number of transactions increase, and maybe more broadband is needed to create bigger blocks, there will be more mining farms again.


No need to pickup the bill. Just don't mine if it's no good for you. This is already happening now: if the price drops, some people stop mining because it costs more than it brings in.

[1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE] ( - ~2 BTC
[1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr]( - ~2,130 BTC
[Famous case]( - ~7,500 BTC
The first 50 BTC of the genesis block are unspendable.
That's almost 10,000 BTC known to be lost. Probably it's much, much more. Would be interesting to have some website dedicated to those cases.
There was a [graph]( here on Reddit some months ago ([post here]( showing the age of the coins by last use. It would be interested to have an update on those graphs once in a while to see how it's changing. I assume around 20% is lost, but there is no proof in that assumption.

Inflation would bring in the same system flaws that fiat money has: loans and the prospect of paying them off with interest. That system is based on debt.

Destroying them is the same as spreading them over all holders, including charities. I think sending them to specific charities would weaken the price drastically, thus not doing the charities holding Bitcoin a favor. 
Also, sending them to a specific charity would take away the neutrality of satoshi and therefore Bitcoin. So I think Satoshi would destroy before donating.
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:43:21
Mass adoption is not necessary. It starts with the few who show interest now. They'll spread the idea further if they think it's good enough.

Sorry, I meant bandwidth...
Most regular household internet connections could support uploading blocks of 8/16/32MB. Maybe not everywhere in the world YET, but connections tend to become faster, not slower.
I have a pretty slow internet connection, compared to what I could get here, and I could most likely support 32MB blocks now already...
Limited bandwidth is used as an argument to not support bigger blocks, but the bandwidth limitation is no problem for probably most nodes (hosts) active now. It could only become a problem in like 10-20 years, and only if all bandwidth improvements stop. Which is very unlikely...

* 1 multisig address (2 of 3) where my family holds 2 and me the 3rd.
* 4 paper wallets which would be found sooner or later (as long as my stuff is not just thrown away)
* 1 encrypted fireproof and waterproof USB with seeds and hints (for the paper wallets). The password is written somewhere as a puzzle where any single member of the family doesn't know all answers, but together they could crack it.
All in all, they could steal them before my death, so it's not 100% safe, but so far I've always trusted my loved ones. It's secure enough for simple burglary, probably even for a house fire (at least if my USB really is fireproof as they claim it is).

Can't see why it can't be both a store of value and a payment protocol. As long as there's no change in the planned amount of monetary inflation (21 million coins, halving every 4 years) it's a way of exchanging something of value without losing value on itself.

1 billion people can very well share $21 billion.
If there's still more demand for it, people will start paying more for a unit, thus increasing the value of all units. So, in case all bitcoins are mined, any added value increases price.

The real danger is not the reputation of Bitcoin, it's the effect it has on policy in some countries. It's easier to define Bitcoin 'illegal' in stead of dealing with the real cybersecurity issues.
We'll see way more of this ransomware in the future. In the past it was just some way of entertainment or show off in knowledge/power to hack computers. Now there are possibilities to monetize those actions. Companies might be able to make backups and secure their systems, but private individuals probably tend to just pay in order not to lose those precious photos or other important documents.

Need to add that the value of Bitcoin will be (and in some way is) quite independent from periodical politics, nationwide disasters or otherwise local events. Of course at this moment, the value of bitcoins is mainly given by US input, but that doesn't need to be the case in a couple of years.
The more the adoption spreads, the lower the dependency on national/local events, and the stronger its store of value will be.

It's only instant if sent to the same bank. Otherwise it mostly takes 1-2 days;
In some cases you need a full name and/or BIC/SWIFT-code as well, making it only convenient if you know the person and if you have both IBAN and BIC;
Banks' websites can be down. In the Netherlands for example, the websites of the biggest banks and the payment processing system (iDeal) were [offline]( a lot in the last year, sometimes for days! In that time, you can't make a payment;
The banks can decide to disallow or cancel your payment and threat to close your account. There are many posts on this subreddit with that example. If the bank doesn't like your transaction history, they can and will close your bank account.
SWIFT transactions are not free. According to [this message]( they might even look into Bitcoin to make SWIFT-transactions. It might be at no **direct** costs to you, but it doesn't make those transactions free.

Yet on their [front page]( it says less than $90,000 have been tipped. Is that in BTC at the current price (e.g. $1 tip half a year ago is worth $0.5 now)?
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:10:05
Say 1 BTC is priced at $100,000.  
The smallest fee possible is 1 Satoshi, as far as no decimals are added.  
1 Satoshi (1/100,000,000) = $0.001
So, even with a coin worth $100k, the fee **could** be $0.001 for on-chain transfers.

1. The volatility will decrease over time. Yes, it's pretty volatile at the moment, but it won't in a couple of years
2. You mean hacking the protocol? That's not easy at all. Hacking single computers/exchanges with personal wallets might be, but taking the right measurements (multisig, trezor, cold wallets) can cancel out most of those risks, especially when big amounts are involved.
3. It's not that easy to lose bitcoin actually. Again, if you take the right measurements. Making backups, check the addresses before you transfer bitcoins to them, storing the keys in safe places are easy things to do. Bitcoin even prevents you from sending it to a wrong address if you make a typo in the receiving address. I say losing your physical wallet in public is a much bigger risk.
4. If you're a bit paranoid, this could be an issue. I try to be informed before I use certain software/hardware/services. There's no 100% guarantee that my hard- and software is malware-free, but the alternative isn't flawless either: banks and governments only guarantee until a certain amount; I pay for it in indirect insurances; banks and governments can freeze my funds if they like to, removing all access to my money. I say it's impossible to trust them either.

You compare apples with oranges here. Taking something physically (candy, car, phone) decreases the amount of it from the original keeper (shop owner). The action has a negative effect for him, even when it's positive for me. 
In this case, a copy is made. I do not take the original away from the owner. As I stated, I am willing to pay for it, but I have no possibility to it. Therefore, I'd rather see it with no advantage (**and no disadvantage**) for the maker, than not seeing it without advantage for the maker. 
Netto, downloading it has a positive result for me and a neutral one for the maker. Not doing so has a negative result for me and a neutral one for the maker. 
You could even say that for the creator his/her work has been seen and enjoyed an extra time when I see it. Ergo, I can morally defend my actions.

I see 2 possibilities for Bitcoin to fall to $0:
* Serious flaw in the protocol -&gt; malfunction and/or major distrust
* Another coin getting way more trust than Bitcoin by everyone (consumers, merchants, governments, liberals, etc.)

It's more probable for bitcoin to hit $10,000 than $1.

Which is a great advantage, if you ask me. You have what you own. If you don't own it, you can't spend it.


Ultimately, one can use Bitcoin for almost all payments. Taxes and other payments to the state could be an exception.


[...] Bitcoins, by contrast, are created using a purely mathematical logic that lacks financial or economic underpinnings (currently 25 new bitcoins every 10 minutes); and they can’t be retired as needed to maintain their scarcity. Given the lack of economic logic behind the net injection of bitcoins, there is increased risk of financial and price instability.
This is almost laughable. "They can't be retired as needed to maintain scarcity"? They are scarce by design.
In my humble opinion, speaking about the lack of economical logic behind the injection of bitcoins in comparison with fiat money, is not showing much insight in the reasons Bitcoin was created in the first place.
I'm really curious about his 'economical logic'. As there's mathematical logic to Bitcoin, one can easily adjust economical strategies and reason, independent from day-to-day political or public opinions. That's real logic.
The only thing that made sense is that bitcoin at the moment is volatile and a risky investment. I think there's no one who will deny that. The volatility will most likely decrease over time, as there's less inflation after each halving and (expectedly) more people will take a share of the total amount of bitcoins.

With a $100,000 Bitcoin price, the popularity that comes with it will guarantee millions of transactions a day.
At this moment, approximately $1,000,000 is accumulated by miners. The same amount will be earned with transaction fees, when the number of transactions increases. If that brings in too little, some miners will stop and the transaction fees will be devided by a smaller number of miners. Ergo, mining will be attracive again.

And we all know they'll fail. It's an improvement on the current system of fiat transfer, at most.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:35:58
NYE of course, not the city...

Generally people here assume price will increase in the future. That being said, there's a fair chance the price will decrease in the next days/weeks. If it does, it will probably not go under 140GBP any soon (assumed to be the bottom at the moment).

This is to make sure the bitcoins are being stored decentralized!
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:27:11
Thanks for this great article! @_date: 2015-03-07 18:01:50
Congratulations! @_date: 2015-02-25 19:50:41
You'll have to pay the bank at some point though... Also, a SEPA-transaction is only 'free' when sent to other banks in the SEPA.
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:48:32
Bitcoin owners: probably 2-3 million  
Bitcoin users (actively spending, trading, following news): 200k-500k
The (pseudonymous) character of Bitcoin doesn't allow us to make exact figures, so all figures in this thread, including mine, are just guesses or assumptions.
I think in the end it's not so important how many people use Bitcoin. More important is if the infrastructure is getting stronger and if the network activity is growing. I think all indicators show that's true.

This could be something...

Watch them closely all day, every day...
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:22:15
Ha, I did as well! 
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:00:58
Yes, I admit it...
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:07:09
you mean lodl
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:48:00
Do amateur miners actually find anything at all? Or will they just get a tiny percentage of a pool and chances of finding something are equally small? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:40:45
Then no one except for Satoshi would know about it...
@_date: 2016-05-01 08:24:10
It will be out of sync permanently
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:56:30
Where can I donate instead?
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:03:14
Are there any (public) statistics on price behaviour on specific days?
If there is significant movement, does the price move mostly during the week, or in weekends? Does it move more at the beginning of the month or at the end of the month?
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:23:34
Street artists should do this... They would be happy to be put on YouTube :) 
@_date: 2015-03-29 12:48:55
Shouldn't the title say 14M Mark, without the $-sign?
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:05:34
Keep looking... maybe you'll find it when you move places in the future. I wouldn't say lost forever, but lost until further notice.
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:16:12
To be honest, one can make free bank transfers with Sepa. Not sure if the banks eat the costs of transactions or if it's really close to zero, but it seems to work for the consumer... 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:53:15
Yes, and those quickest will have the best price... I hope it's still worth dumping them by the time I'm ready to do so (not behind a computer at the time of splitting).
I can't imagine many people actually want BCC, since there are already superior alt-coins available for those who seek bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:17:59
If you look at it that way, 90% of all Bitcoins are held on &gt;22BTC addresses (82.000 of them).
Could of course still include many more people holding on exchanges or other (offchain) services.
Interesting website, thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-02-12 20:28:53
Just the person/entity who paid you knows your Bitcoin-address. Use different addresses and sometimes move (parts of) your money to other addresses you own, then no one will know what you earned on other jobs.
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:27:50
Who likes some scam?!
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:10:11
Hope someone is making a video of all those steps... and hope that the rocket really takes off (both because it would be an anti-climax if it wouldn't and it would mean that we're really on the way to the moon!)

I can't take this news serious. If even the checkable facts are wrong, what about those incidents?
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:03:46
And it's not limited to just the first one!
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:50:24

That database will be very incomplete at very best. If they would continue, the off the radar exchanges would flourish :) 
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:41:33
Seems like I'm till in time... will tip some more on other subs today!
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:15:22
I thought: is the upcoming halving the 4th one already? 
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:25:36
Could be interesting...
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:26:22
Since I don't use Youtube over an account, you may tip someone on my behalf! I trust you pick the right people there... 
$2 @_date: 2015-02-23 23:22:36
This is the actual question... I think I have it in a place no one will ever look for. People would probably find it at a certain time after I'm dead.
My only concern: fire!
@_date: 2016-07-14 11:33:28
I had seen it and wondered why nobody posted it here... Then again, talking about alt-coins is forbidden in this sub 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:59:06
Same here :) I could've been really close to retirement if I made some bolder moves and held my hand a bit longer. I should just stop looking at my cryptos for a couple of years... but then I know I can't
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:43:24
and on the counter or at the checkout... Not everyone looks at the stores window
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:04:35
You're forgetting a scenario where disappointed BIP148'er selling their bitcoins when the softfork is not successful.
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:49:21
Yes, first time I find it easy to save money, or put the excesses into Bitcoin. Would have spent it on nonsense otherwise.
@_date: 2016-07-03 10:44:02
Hold your horses, I said 1 question!
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:20:26
Something, something... more centralisation
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:44:19
Unless you really want to download the blockchain on your computer, I could recommend Electrum. It uses nodes to check the Blockchain for you. Lightweight and pretty safe...
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:12:55
If it doesn't even show up in Google, it must be a very hidden exchange... Probably the  exchange at @_date: 2015-02-08 11:06:56
When can we expect the next halving? I've seen the [Bitcoin clock]( and some other source telling me it's mid-2016. Yet some half year ago it was said it would probably be March 2016.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:05:47
Either way, it will be interesting...  
If it will influence Bitcoin is hard to say. Maybe a little bit, maybe big time. If I were Greek, and Greece would go back to the Drachme, I would probably stall my Euros somewhere else (or convert it into something else like gold/bitcoin) since the government will then probably try to devalue the Drachme in the first years to be able to make labour cheap and export a lot.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:50:55
It's working well, I think the weakest link would be the arbitrators, but so far I had no negative experiences with them.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:45:56
Thanks, then either it has been floating around 1 million or my app does not show the right info
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:32:09
Bought mine for about $0.15 a piece (just 20 of them in pre-sale) and sold them for Bitcoin when they topped $16. Thought I did pretty well, until the last couple of months :) 
I don't regret my actions, but I'm slowly diversifying my crypto assets and buying back bits of ether. Just in case. Still believe Bitcoin will be the best store of value out of all currencies though..
