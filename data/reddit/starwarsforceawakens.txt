Set up your own toshi node so that you don't have to rely on any third parties.

This looks fairly sophisticated for a phishing attack, but in the end it's technically your fault for authorizing the app.

On the contrary I think this is about as unusual as it gets and I would definitely be concerned if I had such an email come my way.  Try to think about if your bank emailed you saying 'hey we want to authorize this app to have full control of everything, just click here to say that's ok'.  Wouldn't you think that was unnecessary and raise a concern with your bank?

Stop donating to weird projects.  The world doesn't need new forum software just to support a bitcoin community.  Everyone that gave that kid bitcoin to make a new forum is naive.  He's not accountable because there is no contract, and now people are acting all surprised that these donations may as well be flushed down the toilet.

Davout wants to artificially restrict the supply of Bitcoin transactions in order to make them more expensive. He seems to completely miss the key feature of Bitcoin being that it is a technology, and that we should make it the best piece of engineering that it can be... Even if that doesn't suit the greedy goals of some economist. Similarly, if all food becomes free because you can 3D print it, Davout would suggest artificially making it expensive so that supermarkets can stay in business.

But then you're comparing volume on margin vs actual volume. All those you mention are massively on margin which is why they have no fees. Even a tiny shift in price wipes out the principle and the exchange takes it all.
