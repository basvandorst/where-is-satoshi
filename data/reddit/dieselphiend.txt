The picture becomes quite clear once one looks at the some of the names on the 1% list...

Federal trials are never fair. Just look at the federal conviction rate.

You do know the current rate is 99%?

We'll probably have to wait several years just to see 2011's *official* data.  Let alone any of the following years. I could care less about trial stats, and plea bargains. You want a better idea of how the feds prosecute ordinary people? Then examine cases like Aaron Swartz. Bunch of tyrannical cock smokers...

John Edwards is one. You'll just find a bunch more like him. People with enough money and power to buck the system, and the occasional innocent.

Indeed. Corporations are all about making money. How could they possibly resist?

Wow. Did you ever find out why they were bothering you?

These companies have absolutely no idea how good they have it right this moment. I welcome them to attempt to prioritize internet traffic. If anything is going to get fiber to our door, from multiple companies, that will. They would simply be creating an enormous niche for new, ISP upstarts to fill.
These new ISP's wouldn't even have to advertise. They would just have to offer unrestricted access and virtually the entire community would flock to them in droves. Furthermore, the creation of these companies could, and likely would often be funded by crowd source campaigns, and I'd bet my last dollar most of them would be readily funded-- even state boroughs and municipalities could get in on it. All of this is compounded by new, emerging technologies.

**These companies pushing for prioritization may indeed make more money for a short time, but they may just cause their very own demise. With regards to information liberation, the genie is out of the bottle. What they envision is nothing more than a greedy, corporate dream-- the entire world, including their developers, are against them, and we'll build around them so fast, they won't know what hit them...**

Did BFL ask you to display this picture on various forums? They have a history of that.

Nothing more than the natural progression  of an emerging market. It's actually quite easy to manipulate...

It's pretty clear to me that they are the ones mining with their hardware. Just as one piece becomes unprofitable, they ship it to you. It's a cycle, they'll keep offering ever more powerful units as the diff goes up, and they'll keep mining with them, then shipping them out as diff increases. It's basically a pyramid scheme.

I've been dreaming of a car like this for years. A common sense machine; light, modular, affordable. It just makes too much damn sense. The big guys could have been making something like this for years. They're all in bed with the oil companies.

Thanks, and grats.
