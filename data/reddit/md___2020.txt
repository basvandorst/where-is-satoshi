What the CME and CBOE is debating right now is rules governing bitcoin derivatives, specifically futures. Derivatives allow investors to "play" an asset while not actually holding the underlying asset - you are making a bet with someone that the future price of bitcoin will be above or below $X - but neither of you actually own the asset. The issue with bitcoin derivatives is volatility. Derivatives are inherently volatile because of the massive leverage associated with them - you don't have to actually own the asset (this is a big reason why the financial crisis happened), but you have financial exposure to the asset. To reduce risk broker dealers require clients to put up collateral in case the bet goes the wrong way. The problem is that with bitcoin being so volatile normal margin amounts might not be enough. The CME and CBOE are trying to iron out these and much more archaic clearing rules right now.

Inflation measures how much prices on consumable goods and services go up. You mentioned prices on investable assets - those are two separate things (and cryptocurrencies is a massive reach, not relevant to real economy). Inflation has been as low over the last ten years as any time in modern economic history (in America).

I've been listening to people scream about the Fed printing money and hyper inflation for literally the last decade, while it turned out that the last ten years have experienced some of the lowest inflation in modern economic history (at least in America). At some point it's not a timing issue - you're just wrong.
