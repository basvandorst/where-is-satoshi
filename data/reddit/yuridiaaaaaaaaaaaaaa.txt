So that's a no for you?

Oh and I suppose there was no one here when the "Natives" with Siberian Highland DNA crossed the Bering Straight. I suppose no native South Americans ever had the idea to venture North. Yup, life sure was peaceful before Europe came with their written history and violence and shit.

Clearly fabricated? So you have evidence that North America was not populated when the 'Natives' crossed the Bering straight? Damn, the world has been waiting for you to present your findings.

I presented data that shows that nicotine is more lethal than caffeine in smaller doses. I wasn't a part of your blood pressure dialogue. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:14:56
Ha, ok. Keep on keeping on. You got nothing, at least my hypothesis stands to reason. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:35:51
Oh ho, that's hilarious coming from the guy who thinks the North American continent was unpopulated until Siberian Natives showed up.
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:31:45
Lol, what? That's not even close to the point of my theory, but sure. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:08:34
When you denied my that my theory had merit. Are you senile? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:47:42


I didn't. I just said that things that are lethal in small doses is something to consider when comparing drugs. A drug like fentanyl is scary for that reason. Mortality rates in small doses ranks highly to me as to which one is worse. I think you'd be better off vaping caffeine than nicotine, for the aforementioned reason. 
You're fighting a losing battle here, because I have my criteria for what constitutes a worse drug, and you have yours.

If you think I'm going to argue against your banking points, you're mistaken. I agree. 
But if you want to talk about 'destructive white rule', I have all day. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:34:34
Yeah, well we don't take land away from white farmers.

"The estimated lower limit of a lethal dose of nicotine has been reported as between 500 and 1000 **mg**"
" a 16-year-old boy in Toronto ingested something like 6 or 8 **grams** of caffeine (25 to 33 Monsters) via 30 or 35 pills called "pink hearts." He suffered chest pain, elevated blood sugar and irregular heartbeat, but was treated and survived. The physicians who published on the case noted: "On examination, he was alert, oriented, nervous, agitated and irritable"--exactly how you'd imagine a teenager on way too much caffeine."
I put an emphasis on the unit measurements.

No, *you're* making no sense. You're arguing that caffeine is worse because people consume more of it and it's easier to consume a lot. You're forgetting that people don't consume nicotine only via cigarette. You can control how much nicotine is in your vape, for example. Also, I wasn't arguing which is done in higher amounts, I was arguing which is worse. Being lethal in smaller doses scores highly with me in terms of which is worse. Fentanyl is considered one of the worst things to cut heroin with because a very small dose can kill someone.
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:17:32
Who gives a shit about long term effects when a gram of nicotine could likely kill you. You could've wrote, 'I don't have a great argument but I'll disagree with you anyway' and it would have been the same argument... but i digress.
