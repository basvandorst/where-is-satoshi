This feels like bad news.
Twitter has never been a profitable company, and censors the fuck out of it's userbase. On top of that they collect wild amounts of data.

Yeah bing is really taking over my searches. I wish they would add a "forums or discussions" filter and I'd be all over it. My code doesn't work in bing unfortunately.

You should also be held accountable then. You are resetting your ticket every time you message them; that is how ticket systems work in general.
"Hello - Ticket created 1/1/2011"
"Hello - Ticket update 1/3/2011"
"Hello - Ticket update 1/5/2011"
You are shifting yourself to the back of the line.

Search results have gone extremely downhill in the last 5 years. Year over year it is noticeably returning results unrelated to searches especially when looking for proper information about specific things. It is very heavily targeting news sources from what I can tell. I don't even use google adwords anymore.

I don't because I do not wish to verify on gdax.

It doesn't matter. I gave my dad .005 btc and he is thrilled. He is an old stock guy and checks charts every day now. The reason I gave him such a small amount is so he can learn to interact with it, trade safely and understand the concept of bitcoin. Not give him $100; you've completely missed the point by saying "lol .001 is $15" no, it is .001btc.

Nicehash 2 is a simple way of getting in to bitcoin mining.

Dave Kleiman and Hal Finney helped Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto make Bitcoin a long with the help of the rest of the cryptography email list they were heavily involved in.

Man I need to take up scamming. How people fall for this stuff I'll never know.... They seem to do really well though. That sucks man, you can't get it back, it is gone.

No problem. Side note I would highly reccomend trezor over ledger just based on compatibality with systems.

Yup. I have mine in my safe, I do keep 10% on exchange though.
