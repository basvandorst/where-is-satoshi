Sorry, wrong again... nobody pays me to call a spade a spade, I operate my own business ��

Grow up... you guys are so pathetic. 
“Since roger doesn’t support the same as us anymore let’s try to destroy everything he invests in...” 
this is the exact reason so many of us long time bitcoin users are switching... your “group” is toxic and malicious.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:21:19
It’s called diversification... something you seem to not be too keen on. ��

Everyone who made 6 figures this year in crypto needs to pat themselves on the back... self control and education is key.  Key
... We did it.

Coming from the guy trying to run a smear campaign because they don’t like what someone else has chosen to promote and invest in... ������
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:07:17
You are a sad, sour, pathetic, shill...
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:21:24
No... they just don’t want to see another coin as some sort of competition so like to spend their time organizing, crying, and being malicious. Sad because most of them are in their late 30’s-40’s.
r/bitcoin has quite the case against themselves right now with reddit when it comes to channeling information and trying to form others opinions on a certain way.

Well that’s cool for you, but not for those of us that have been using it for years to send money and now all of a sudden the narrative changes to we need fees because we shouldn’t spend it. Not spending it and it just “magically gaining value” is what would make it a Ponzi scheme. It needs to be used.

They suffer from cognitive dissonance in this thread if you can’t tell...

It’s called USDT... that’s how BTC is getting pumped on bitfinex... whole lot of funny money and market manipulation going on from both sides. BTC camp is just as guilty as BCH camp when it comes to manipulation of the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:47:07
Actually... it is how it could work.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:12:09
You are correct.
Yes we have many options now... it’s just... I want to use bitcoin... ��
So we are forced to “choose a side” between BTC/BCH or move to other alts like Dash, Zcash, or LiteCoin. 
Bitcoin and Litecoin are going to allow people to run a fractional reserve via their nodes once Lightning Network is implemented lol (laughing but not funny)
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:02:50
That’s great news! We are all so very happy for you! 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:09:25
Yes you 100% can... Facts don’t have feelings bud.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:14:24
I’m with you 100%... look at the toxicity towards anyone that dare dislike anything about Cores version of Bitcoin... they get downvoted to hell and harassed by a bunch of nerds hodling 2 BTC thinking they rule he world ����
Your communities rhetoric will be one of the many things that brings BTC down. ZEC, DASH, BCH communities are way less toxic and accept whoever for whatever they want to use...
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:30:39
Not fake news... if I ran a node let’s say and knew that 100 BTC came through my node each day I could leverage it just like a fiat system.
 Also not very secure as you use the same address and it would be extremely costly to change your address time and time again.

This is the link you actually want to read... they try to bury it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:56:21
It’s a SegWit testnet.

Tell me, how does the NYA differ from the HKA which so many people now against the upgrade signed?
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:27:02
It can’t be an altcoin if users feel it is the real bitcoin.

Quite a few core developers, and Blockstreams very own Adam Back, and Sam Mow to name a few.
