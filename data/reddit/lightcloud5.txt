If a mining computer is infected, then you can assume that the computer will act on behalf of the hacker (i.e. the hacker controls the computer).  The hacker would likely reap the rewards of mining (although mining using a computer isn't very efficient anyway).
This isn't fundamentally different from a malicious party doing malicious things using their own computer (the only difference being that the malicious activities originates from a compromised computer).  Obviously, a robust protocol such as bitcoin handles disruptive users, so someone acting maliciously will not meaningfully affect the network, and indeed there is little economic incentives for someone to act maliciously (i.e. against the bitcoin protocol).  (There is, however, economic incentive in compromising other computers and making them mine bitcoins on your behalf, since even inefficient mining is effective if you don't pay for electricity or hardware.)

At minimum, follow this up with "open in Chrome incognito" or end with "wipe all browser cookies, history, and other things (ctrl+shift+delete)".

Literally you put $100 in the bank, and after a year, you end up with less than $100.  i.e. the APR is literally negative
Real rates below 0 is easy.  You put $100 in a bank, get 1% interest (so you have $101) but inflation is 2%.

That's true, but I'm guessing the screenshot is just a generic message (where they just replace "NAME_OF_VIRUS" with "BitCoin").
The entire paragraph has several grammatical and spelling errors too, making me think the writer didn't really put a lot of thought or effort into it.

I'm guessing collectors have a differing opinion.  If a collector bought a movie and ended up with a bootleg copy (disregarding the fact that the bootleg copy is a copyright violation), a collector would be ticked (even if the bootleg copy was bit-for-bit identical to the actual legit version) simply because they want a genuine copy.

I can't imagine we're anywhere close to a cashless society.  Too many places still only take cash, and a huge portion of the population (unfortunately, it's mostly the lower class / poorer folks) are "unbanked" and largely depend on cash.
The US Treasury can't even muster up the courage to get rid of pennies, since of all the coins, they're the most useless.

No we went chip+signature.  The PIN is nowhere to be seen :P
