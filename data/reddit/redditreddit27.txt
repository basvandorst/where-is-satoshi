There is a company out there, sorry, I can't remember now which one, or who it is) that periodically sells off chunks of bitcoins on a pretty regular basis (about 15,000 at time). Just normal business. nothing to worry about.

You don't do things because for the money. You do things because they are right or wrong. The love of money is the root of all evil because if you simply do it for the money, all evil has to do is name your price. If all evil has to do is name your price, then yes, you may profit in the short-term, and it may look like a blessing on the one hand, but with the other hand the thing your life depends on is taken from you, and in the end, you see that going for the money will eventually leave you controlled, without freedom, and as you put it, fucked. 
The priority/criteria for decision making is freedom/love first, not money.

Why would you choose to go into debt? The borrower is servant to the lender. The whole reason prices are so high is because everyone is borrowing money they don't have and it inflates the prices and screws us all into borrowing. If nobody borrowed money they didn't HAVE to, the world would be a better place, and prices would be more affordable.
Debt is the problem that has gotten us into the financial crisis mess. Why would you choose to take out a loan and pay interest to the banks?
You know you don't actually own your home until it's paid off. You give the bank your $25,000 down payment, and THEY are the ones who become the real owners of the property. If you don't pay em according to all the fine print, they can just take your house, and keep all the money you paid them + the down payment!

Most people who have Bitcoins, would rather keep their Bitcoins because they behold them as more valuable than fiat currency. A lot of people have paid a premium to obtain their Bitcoins (buying them, or mining them you have transaction fees, commissions, and mining hardware costs). I would expect that the typical business should be realistic and offer a 10-15% discount vs the current exchange rate...only then would you find equilibrium. Bitcoins are super rare, and undervalued! There are high costs to entry just to get your hands on them. You will only get them if you pay a premium, or you offer a discount. Simple supply and demand and free market at work.

1. Bitcoin is too brilliant a technology for it to be outlawed.
2. Too many brilliant minds are behind it, in support of it.
3. There is nothing evil about it, unlike drugs for example, there is no harm in it, so no ration reason.
4. The cat is already out of the bag.
5. Pretty sure the CIA has known all about it at least since 2010, and its been able to fly so far.
6.

Accepting Bitcoin at garage sales sounds like a good idea. I wonder if you will actually get anyone using Bitcoin.
At this point, you may be better off just offering a discount to people if they pay in BTC. Then, when they ask you what it is, you can explain it.
Probably at this point, most garage sale shopper type people don't know what Bitcoin is. If nothing else it could be a educational opportunity.

~~~~Bitcoin is MORE environmentally friendly ~~~ than what is currently used today. Bitcoin is better for our planet than cutting down and mining out all our nonrenewable resources like all the copper, nickel, iron, and materials used to make physical coins...Oh and what about all the ***CHEMICALS*** used to make paper currency. Old stuff wears out and has to be replaced, whereas Bitcoin doesn't wear out.

maybe buy a million dollars worth of gold...then sell the gold for bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-10 09:33:06
The price is going to $3500, and onwards.
