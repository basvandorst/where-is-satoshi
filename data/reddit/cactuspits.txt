@_date: 2015-12-11 18:35:19
it's all those crooked cops that were dumping stolen coins for the last 2 years that have finally stopped.
@_date: 2015-12-08 03:03:49
(score hidden tho)
@_date: 2015-12-18 22:46:45
my grandpa used to talk about the olden days back when a single digit increase seemed impossible..he had 3 Commodore Vic-20s running all the time in the basement pulling down a block maybe once a week, and keeping the house warm at the same time.  if he could only see the network now..
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:02:41

@_date: 2015-12-08 03:03:35

@_date: 2015-12-08 22:08:23

@_date: 2015-12-23 03:36:42

@_date: 2015-12-18 21:05:27

@_date: 2015-12-03 14:29:08

@_date: 2015-06-15 23:15:36

go ahead mfers...try it
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:27:26
wouldn't surprise me...Bitcoin has brought out the absolute worst in humanity..the greed and deceit...it could be a beautiful, elegant solution to a worldwide issue but it might just get wrecked like a new Ferarri Berlinetti driven by an inexperienced fontas...it's almost poetic how on one end you have Bitcoin, mathematically perfect and secure and fascinating, and on the other end a Human being...the exact opposite, a fucking retard who will ruin every good thing that comes along 
fuck Bitcoin it's time to move on to the next scam fest 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:24:02
Bitcoin is DEAD

@_date: 2015-08-03 03:24:42
no fucking way
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:14:21
Jesus fucking Christ Bitcoin should bring out the best in people but instead it brings out the greed and the fear and the fucking fomo...not sure I want to be a part of this thing anymore :(
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:54:44
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:13:53
seems like a good idea 
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:57:04

Karpeles-"US agents are responsible for taking down GOX and stealing all the coins"
U.S. agents-"fucking arrest him"
@_date: 2015-07-31 00:07:04
and emotional as well
@_date: 2015-08-24 01:02:28
Mark Karpeles' cat
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:51:44
but he was also buying tons with money he didn't have either
@_date: 2015-07-18 14:48:24
it's either a fat finger mistake or some cop dumping his stolen coins 
@_date: 2015-07-12 15:01:51
@_date: 2015-08-01 04:59:15
Karpeles hacked it before he got arrested
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:57:06
I came here thinking this was a winklvii thread
@_date: 2016-02-08 01:09:11
ayyye lmao
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:09:19
he's probably with his cat in his pimped out Honda heading for the hills...after he picks up a 4 pack of Frappacinos 
@_date: 2015-07-08 14:08:05
the word "Bitcoin" was said within the first line of dialogue and the movie is basically a bitcoin tutorial...and quite accurate at that..I was in a theater full of people who, I'm pretty sure, hadn't heard much about it before and they walked out of there educated about it.  The movie also did a great job of cleaning up its image as well.
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:24:08
people are content being, well, content..content with credit cards and advertisements and fees for everything...they feel happy and safe when they take $600 to the bank and deposit it and get a small receipt and then look on their phone the next day and there's the money...I am 100% about Bitcoin but most people I know couldn't care less about disruptive potential of new technology..sheeple gonna sheep
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:14:27
especially at international airports 
@_date: 2016-02-01 03:03:34
no fucking shit it's secure
@_date: 2016-02-07 16:27:18
after all, that's the only reason Bitcoin was created, to line your pockets with fiat. It's just a Ponzi pump and dump scheme so, yeah
@_date: 2016-02-13 09:34:44
he's not wrong
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:49:04
under $200 soon
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:24:08
welcome to the club
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:19:57

@_date: 2015-09-02 03:27:40
greed has and will kill bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:48:58
i like my new lawnmower app
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:27:42
is that how they do their charts? on a chalkboard like that?
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:11:21
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:35:25
I would make empty paper wallets and coat my Trapper Keeper™ with them...and maybe some Litecoin ones too
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:32:59
not only more have been mined but a bunch from DPR are freed up and who knows where the Gox coins have been..but yeah, the volume is up for sure and it's a good thing
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:06:18
Bitcoin is just a whale team pump and dump Ponzi scheme and occasionally used to buy drugs and extort and fuck people over.
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:12:49
@_date: 2015-11-12 14:44:05

that picture really describes it all
@_date: 2015-11-10 05:45:54
meanwhile ross's mom is dying of a broken heart...what a fucking disgrace this war on drugs is
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:28:55

@_date: 2015-11-27 13:11:25
you are those that don't care...
@_date: 2015-11-26 01:48:46
lmao..."experts say"
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:14:41
might as well wipe your ass with it and flush it down with yesterday's dinner
@_date: 2015-11-13 06:12:15
what is bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-01 20:39:42
I like the way he says "Bitcoin" in that scene 
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:37:15
the next day a coin moves from the million 
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:21:22
and dat hash rate too...why the increase?
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:40:40
me neither...I used to follow him on Twitter too but after his p&amp;d scam and his never ending mouthing off on Twitter I had to quit him.
@_date: 2015-11-02 03:39:38
you mean my meth head X-husband who is the father of my 3 kids installed that in my house? even though I have no idea how a computer works and completely trust him (I have been cheating on him and communicating via computer) would he do that? 
amifucked? :(
@_date: 2015-11-14 04:37:55
basically it's Satoshi talking about next level Bitcoin...so pay fucking attention 
@_date: 2015-11-02 13:55:29
well then, just wait until it is
@_date: 2015-11-18 01:03:23
if I can't cash out and line my pockets with fiat then what is the point?
@_date: 2015-09-01 23:04:48
that means more dumping into fiat...and more price decline
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:39:15
Bitcoin also helped me get over a bad break up 2 years ago...but it has also made me depressed in the last 1 1/2 years too, if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:23:49
pretty much the only news about this auction was that Tim Draper was NOT taking part..so, these are certainly not his coins.
@_date: 2015-11-20 22:55:43
lol wut
@_date: 2015-10-24 02:57:23
warning don't use "buch" of bitcoins if you don't know how to use Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:40:46
they didn't skimp on the miners fees..nice
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:22:35
the address starts with a 3 and yeah that means multi-sig..why would the new owner of these coins send directly to an exchange? lol
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:25:46
that teacher is a fucking idiot
@_date: 2015-10-21 02:40:43
yeah..I feel ya man...fucking craptsy
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:25:57
@_date: 2015-10-11 17:40:23
this guy trolling?
@_date: 2015-11-12 04:26:42
yeah uptrend is over...going to earths mantle now and likely further...in 2 years you will be charged $10K per BTC just to own one.
@_date: 2015-11-24 05:26:04
how many private blockchains will have the hashrate and the security of the Bitcoin network?...none.
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:30:01
anyone can use multisig 
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:11:55
you got to babysit yer Bitcoins..when your sittin on the puter 
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:05:11
excellent question
@_date: 2015-11-12 10:20:02
and the ex continues to haunt me
@_date: 2015-10-27 15:36:32
we miss you Karpeles 
@_date: 2015-10-14 00:38:44
sell now cry later
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:03:54
it will be different because Karpeles isn't manipulating the shit out of it
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:50:10
is it?
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:19:36
lol 
@_date: 2015-10-08 14:35:04

@_date: 2015-10-16 15:01:04
why is it going up? it never goes up 
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:31:50
fuck yeah 
@_date: 2015-10-17 16:27:25
if word gets out they will likely ban Bitcoin...again.
@_date: 2015-10-28 11:24:33
and tricked out special edition Honda Civics 
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:59:35
I am pushing Danica to accept my tip
@_date: 2015-10-18 21:07:12
he can't wrap his little brain around how it works 
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:29:21
means nothing..whales and walls..if it stays it will get eaten anyway with the steady chomping going on
@_date: 2015-11-02 00:09:01
there's more bitcoins out there now than back then
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:43:41
Karpeles was the reason for that spike and probably others too...buying insane amounts with no real money...not even fontas can do what Karp did.
@_date: 2015-10-26 15:27:20
I know right? that would be the mother of all Bitcoin AMAs...unless one of them(s) is Satoshi 
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:29:42
whoah, my first ever tip here!
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:17:05
a pillow fort 
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:03:30
if all you care about is USD$ profits then you aren't in this for the right reasons
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:23:11
so sad
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:12:33
did the transaction go through? 
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:44:07
it could be worse
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:14:27
I used to but now that Bitcoin is dead it makes no sense...I might as well put some clay pigeons in my toaster and leave it on all day.
@_date: 2015-10-20 01:09:39
I feel like I'm playing pitfall on an original Atari when I try to get on that fucking site...and I have a few btc there but it's so fucking hard to get them out..been on there for 2 years
@_date: 2015-10-28 01:40:24
Jesus...in 2 years we will all be making popcorn when it breaks $100 and in 3 years we will all be living in our cars...really?
