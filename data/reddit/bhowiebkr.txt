Even though it has its problems, It’s been around for 6 years and not been shutdown. It's got the test of time. I wouldn’t do active trading on it until it’s more reliable but for simple currency conversions into and out of crypto it’s fine.

Keeping it on a flash drive is a very bad idea. They are notorious for getting corrupted. Why not a paper wallet?

Buy one like the ledger nano s. You can get it on Amazon.  You sound like you are rushing into crypto currency for the first time. There is lots of information for beginners on where to begin published everywhere. It's better to start out slowly.

I’d keep it. Put it in a Bank safety deposit box. And forget about it for a couple years.

Slowdowns across the board. Times like these is when we need working exchanges.

You are looking to just hold? Don't keep bitcoin on your phone. Use a paper wallet or buy a hardware wallet. If your starting out, practice with a tiny amount of bitcoin that you wouldn't care if you lose.
