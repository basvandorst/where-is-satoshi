Like giving HPV to all the unvaccinated children to prove the antivaxxers wrong. Nice... (Sarcasm)
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:43:58
Can someone explain? Simple payment verification  means non-scalable?
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:36:09
Apologies, I'm job seeking. I misread the post.
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:28:01
What about Service desk jobs?
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:27:29
Blame whoever you like. The point is, many people would be harmed.
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:11:21
Do you have a good article on why it's a scam? Honestly, I've only received hostility from the BTC community so far despite being 10x deeper in BTC than BCH.
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:00:41
Haha well I'm pretty amazing. For real though. I've read some arguments but it's hard to find something unbiased. Not that I've been hunting a lot. I'm more of an EOS, PIVX and IOTA guy
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:29:50
I was playing devil's advocate but yes; people in the skeptic community use a technique called steelmanning; making the strongest argument on behalf of antivaxxer and then showing why it's still wrong.

Cool man. Insult people for making an analogy.
Money has the power to save lives and for around 1k US, you can reliably save one child from Malaria.
Regardless, the point is, you're harming people financially to prove a point. It's petty. 
Here's an analogy for you:
Burning someone's life savings to prove that keeping cash under a mattress isn't fireproof.

Thank you, this was an excellent reply! Really appreciate it. 
I can see far more flaws now in BCH as a whole.  I'm still not comfortable calling it a scam. Even with all the evidence you provide, I couldn't conclude there's  obvious misconduct despite obvious negligence.
You've helped me gain more perspective for sure and a greater skepticism for BCH. I'll keep researching too.
@_date: 2018-08-17 10:01:04
Ahh ok. So it's sorta a stab against BCH which, like Satoshi said will have supernodes (probably)?
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:09:34
This is the right attitude for the crypto community. Really helps people.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:26:04
Sure, that works. The level of harm to some would be vary. Some just 1st degree in the finger; a few bucks gone. Some, 3rd degree facial burns kinda stuff; utter financial ruin, homelessness, etc. I do like your analogy though.
@_date: 2018-08-17 21:45:42
I misspoke. I meant how Satoshi said Bitcoin would have super nodes like BCH probably will.
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:09:10
And fucked over a whole lot of people to prove a point?
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:53:24
Haha. I bought most of both of them after the fork. I actually sold my bcash a few weeks after the fork and have been buying BTC since then and bought a little BCH more recently.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:41:36
Ohh. I see the misunderstanding. I think he's talking about Bitcoin being up infinity percent. I could be mistaken but that's how I read it.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:50:07
If something increases in value by 100%, it will be 200% of initial.
If something decreases by 100%, it's worth 0% of initial. Is that what you're referring to?
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:22:25
He's saying that the value was 0 intially. That's true. If the price goes from 0 to 1c, it's up infinity percent.
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:49:09
It's probably just worth us waiting for him to clarify but my reading is:
"It's up 20% over past year": Bitcoin, right?
"If you zoom out on USD graph, it's up infinity % since inception"
My interpretation is the BTC vs USD graph. My reasoning is that the previous comment is talking about Bitcoin purchasing power (or am I mistaken?). Secondly, is there a graph of USD purchasing power since USD was created? Maybe. I don't know. I know there's a BTC vs USD graph that approximates BTC value since inception.
I won't waste more of our time haha. Anyway, have a good day/night. I'm off.

Why is spending money on 'legal goods' considered generous?
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:52:59
Where do you think the hashpower would come from?
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:53:36
And I'm you.
