Can I ask why some are opposed to LN? ~~*pls don't downvote*~~
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:58:46
*puff puff puffff pass.* Hacked. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:23:53
What would the third layer for Bitcoin be? LN is the second layer. What would come after?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:10:20

Unless the cost per unit is so low that it makes usage affordable. The constant income, how ever miniscule, could easily add up on a larger scale for services like streaming, news etc.

Yup. This is the correct one.

No this is BITCONNEEEEEEEEEEECT

Could it be your USB port that is wonky?

Lol I was thinking the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:44:51
Those random words are what give you access to the Bitcoin "wallet". It's a private key. Revealing your private key to someone essentially gives them complete access to your crypto even if they don't have the "wallet". If it is indeed a hardware wallet, anyone with your private key can simply use that to get a new wallet and set it up as their own; complete with all your crypto.

I woke up groggy. Opened coinbase and saw the number 7 and hit buy. Went back to sleep with a few bucks down. All in all a typical day.

Yea. I use GDAX too but this time i went through the coinbase app
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:41:01
Thanks for looking out for me. :)
I know the stories behind them. I only occasionally purchase from them like when I want to take advantage of a sudden dip. And I do have my own wallet. A Trezor.

@_date: 2017-11-13 14:09:02
The biggest reason gold was used was it's inert nature. Unlike most other precious metals, gold doesn't tarnish, rust, melt in the heat, or crumble. It's also easy to determine the metal's purity. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:32:39
Except when you drunkenly show everyone your seed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:33:58

I'm not sure that this is how it works.

I'm kind of expecting a major dip once the price crosses 10k. Hope to be proven wrong.

Come on, you're just being pedantic. What the author means is that it's much easier to use smaller valuations during daily trade. Nothing is stoping you from trading in the gold bar you speak of for something of equivalent value.

@_date: 2017-10-02 04:54:02
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:49:20
I think that's what the author is playing on. For mass adoption to be successful, people should "feel" that it's easier to use. Isn't it all about *feelings* nowadays? ;)
