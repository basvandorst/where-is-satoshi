Thanks a lot!

I just ask if you have time for a quick review after receiving your free copy, I could really use the support! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:19:27
Is it just me or is his face just  so... punchable?
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:18:11
Today only!
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:41:32
Stairway to HODL.
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:44:31
Either way you win.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:42:43
Looking like it!

The BITCOIN GODS HAVE SPOKEN.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:50:28
I literally don't know what to say about this. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:28:32
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:50:42
Love it! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:02:26
I'm going to watch Braveheart tonight while the futures kick off. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:32:44
I'd say we've caught ourselves, and are "kicking" as of right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:24:23
My dad tells me to "sell that god damned bitcoin" at least once a week.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:56:55
EVERYONE SHOUDL HODL. (always in BODL)
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:35:16
Actually it is an OUI. I'm not actually sending $20 worth to a wallet or anything. It's a christmas card with a $20 BTC bill drawn on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:28:13
I'm almost done with my book, Cryptocurrency Trading 101, and will link it here when finished. Very soon!
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:14:56
God I love not seeing bitcoin cash up there. Just having to see it every day literally makes me sick. 
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:27:04
So much bullish news lately.

Bittrex did this to me for months. Locked and ignored. Then I called them out by tagging them in a very unhappy tweet and they magically fixed it the next day.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:15:17
I can see it.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:40:23
Coming to r/bitcoin to ask why bitcoin sucks is like going into your local butcher and asking why meat sucks.
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:28:38
\*gets popcorn\*
@_date: 2019-08-21 12:58:42
Anyone have an updated version?
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:01:32
Anddd its gone.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:32:16
Buttcoin is at it again!
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:57:05
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:15:27
WTF just happened
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:43:35
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:14:30
Same. I think a lot of people have similar stories.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:08:47
I hope it just randomly flies back up as much as it randomly fell so it screws all the sellers over.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:45:52
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:04:02
It does kind of seem like a perfect storm for Bitcoin, doesn't it?
@_date: 2019-08-29 17:50:58
I feel like we're going to jump right back up to 10k...
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:39:27
Tether ruined crypto for me.
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:25:51

@_date: 2019-12-02 16:46:52
I'm honored! (And lucky!) I also bought a second mug at full price as a tip of the hat to u/dont_drink_the_milk
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:21:35
Hmmmm. Kucoin exchange is sounding real good right about now.
@_date: 2019-12-18 20:59:15
Someone’s butthurt
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:41:56
Love seeing all the shorters getting rekt.

Username checks out. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 16:52:29
Hope y'all didn't get caught in the bear trap...
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:09:19
This is big.
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:47:54
Right? It's buy time.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:44:44
Hahaha sounds like OP isn't from Maine.
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:08:01
Interesting that this isn't really doing anything to the price.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:34:41
Still hasn't broken the wedge.
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:36:44
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:06:20
Futures can get fucked.
@_date: 2019-09-02 11:54:11
PUMP IT UP! [
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:17:46
Broke the latest resistance line!
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:06:34
THANK FUCKING FUCK.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:28:15
Bittrex did this to me for months—they finally released it back to me when I tagged them and called them out on twitter. I’m sure you’ve tried that?
