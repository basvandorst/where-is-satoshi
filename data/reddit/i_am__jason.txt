When it dropped late December I was like "Oh shhheeett" and proceed to sit by my computer losing my soul and my money. 
Now I just sit by my computer and laugh while wearing my "JUST HODL IT" shirt. Because we all know where were headed and if you don't here's a little analogy: *⊕* Earth(current) ---&gt; *◉* Moon(2020) ---&gt; *☼* Sun(2025) = John McAfee not having to eat his dick in 2020
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:32:30
I totally understand what your saying! But like bro, this guy is fucking up the market... hes got like over 1 million dollars moving around constantly its pretty stupid! Like legit please go watch the depth chart zoomed in 4x or 3x, and the trade history. You will see what I'm talking about
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:43:26
I'm usually a HODLER in these times myself. But today I decided to spice things up a bit, and so far I'm shorting pretty well for a rookie.
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:05:19
Lol thanks I guess 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:30:44
Yeah unfortunately I didn't do the same... But JUST HODL IT amiright lol

Haha well I'm only 19 so a million dollars is a lot to me. I made a lot of money from crypto being only 19 but a million is a fuck ton lol! I'll read that Wiki sounds interesting! Thanks for responding my friend (:
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:40:27
Thanks bro! bought it with bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:29:54
Haha yep I got that part down! Don't think the market would be doing these magic tricks if it was the same thing as Bitcoin. Thanks for the heads up tho, more people need to understand that.

I wasn't alive for the internet bubble... sorry can't help you out on this one!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:58:33
I mean yes! But that would help keep the price high. Its when sellers sell for lower than market value, this is when the price goes down. And if there is a high demand sellers won't have to sell for under market value because buyers are willing to pay above market value since the demand is so high! From my understanding!
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:24:17
ohhh of course and I know exactly what your talking about, I went thru it too in 2013!
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:21:35

Well defiantly taking an L on this one as well guys! Fair-well everyone my time here in r/bitcoin is done! At least I had one post make from page! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:22:11
To be honest I'm just excited to go buy a Big Mac from McDonalds with my Bitcoin! Word on the street says there are high chances of them accepting Bitcoin mid 2018.    
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:55:10
uhhh if the demand is to high would that make the price go up? Yuh know the supply and demand concept?!? higher demand, lower supply raises the value of "said" object. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:39
HAHAHAHA anddd.... Maybe if my luck is good I'll travel to both places. Wouldn't that just be a journey!!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:10:27
I totally agree with what you saying a lot of people are defiantly labeling it as a currency to buy Illegal drugs with. But from my understanding 99.9% of Bitcoin is used 100% legitly (source: John Mcafee). Apparently Monero has taken over that market because it is 100% untraceable. Just the facts that I heard thought it was interest, so figured I would share.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:12:21
Haha yes exactly! This community is awesome although I spend way to much time on here...  
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:00
Shoot... Internet lag! My mom told me that if your not first your last! Looks like I took an L on this one...
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:13:46
Haha probably! But no one knows how much money that man is actually worth... 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:06
Yes that did happen! But the market is so much different today, Bitcoin is literally going mainstream in the next couple of months/year! Like we have passed the stage of half the currency being transacted on Silk road. Back then the Bitcoin wasn't viewed as being useful in real world scenarios. Times have changed for the better and it is so much easier to buy and sell bitcoin today then back in 2012/2013. I have been in the game for quite a while myself and it has done nothing like this before. This is mainly due to people actually accepting bitcoin as a currency and seeing a future in its capabilities. If you were to ask 50 random people back then if they knew what bitcoin was I bet maybe 1 or 2 would actually know! Completely different today, But hey not trying to shill you. Stick to what you believe in, that's just my opinion!
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:01:22
Lol its contagious! But so is Bitcoin, give it a couple months and all these new comers are going to be addicted to watching the charts! I can just imagine my grandpa sitting in his recliner staring at the little graph on his computer screen go up and down while he eats his BBQ potato chips.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:12:02
HAHAHA I mean she has his phone number so I believe her.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:10:09
Better I'm sick of waiting, this is gonna be history once they accept BTC. I mean... history in my life!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:33
Im really not sure, but I see some hot shots out there throwing around 30 bitcoins like its petty cash!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:21:35
I don't get it... is like lyrics or something?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:32:31
Oh oh my turn! 15k by Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:22:12
Totally agree with that! Your statement is 100% valid, I have been confused by that before aswell! But their is a market price which the every bitcoin follows. If you look at your Polo Estimated earnings, it will be a different amount than the price shown next to the "Markets" table on the main page! This is because all bitcoin must follow the same price! Otherwise why wouldn't I just send my Bitcoin to a different exchange site that has a higher price and cash out! Repeat the same exact process of buying thru a exchange site selling lower and transferring it to the exchange site with a higher price! There must be a set price for all bitcoin as a whole or this process of transferring bitcoin around would be easy as cake to make money!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:56:18
Hey man, totally get that! I hope the outcome is in your favor as well! Thanks for the comment!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:35:40
No, I like your style my friend

I feel like your the type of Redditor that either gets +100 up votes or -100 down votes on your comments lol! Thought this was pretty funny tho, thanks for the comment!! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:02:28
No sarcasm here sir! Just cold hard facts! I mean I can see how you thought I was being sarcastic about John McAfee he did make a bet having the alternative being to eat his own dick guys a fucking nut job lol!
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:19:25
Hey man this is a really good and relatable response. My parents said pretty close to the same thing my grandma said back a year ago once I started spending lots of my money on bitcoin. But over the past couple of months my dad actually apologized to me for being rationally ignorant and not taking the time to understand bitcoin and give it a chance. He asked me to help him out getting money into Bitcoin. So I mean yes people have a tough time changing their opinion once they have made up their mind. But it is possible to change someones point of view. Exactly how I changed my Dads view on Bitcoin and now he is an investor himself!
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:21:45
Do you want me to tell it again?

WOW... didn't even think about that. I'm going to call him and make a new bet that BTC will be at 15k by Christmas LOLOL. I don't know if I will win this round but I'll tell him I'll send him $100 bitcoin if it doesn't hit 15K, just to refund him and get him involved.

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:04:41
I've heard from many credable sources (aka John McaFee) that the Price tends to follow what ever happens in Zimbabwe. So I wouldn't be surprised if we hit that sometime in the future as well! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:02
Wait your talking about "Bcash" right? Cause I totally agree!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:45:10
Definitely not a full corrections... but hear me out it did drop to $12,300! I mean thats like $700, but yes it did recover very quickly. Therefore it must have corrected it self (dip) then said hell no and corrected itself (pump)! BOOM everyone's right, how about that? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:30:42
I agree! I feel like it will come sooner than the end of the year, I could honestly see it going there tonight or sometime within a week! I feel like the higher the price goes the easier it is to increase... and well decrease as well!
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:14:43
haha that's kinda part of the joke!
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:42:57

Hey Man, I just am a really open person who doesn't get offended easily and to be honest doesn't give a fuck what other people think about me. Not trying to be a dick to anyone!

If your actually offended by this I apologize, it was all in good spirit!

I've been in this game for quite a while. been a Hodler since 1k back last year! But I've never seen this kind of supply and demand curve before.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:22:52
well since this isn't going to make front page how about you look at my other post! Its actually funny... if you don't get offended easily! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:10:24
Very true! But I feel like if Bitcoin manages to reach 1 million, the USD value is probably going to decrease quite a bit. But who knows only the future can tell!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:20:55
I agree they keep recovering quickly! The only time the dip doesn't recover is when there is a decent sized gap between the firm foundation of the buy wall/slope and the market price. Basically what happened earlier today when we couldn't break $14,399. It literally tried like 4 times to break it and everyone was being pussy's. But anyways at $14,400 the sell wall/slope foundation was strong and pretty big at market price and the buy wall/slope foundation was weak until like $200 behind the market price where it was actually built up. So every time someone would break the tiny buy wall the price would drop like $20 and then everyone would panic sell. Then the price would plummet $200 until it hit our nice cushioned buy wall/slope. It was so annoying having those $200-$500 swings all day. People were probably just butt hurt they sold at a bad time and didn't want to buy back at a relatively reasonable spot.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:02:45
Okay! Good talk my man
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:03:23
Uhh... I think my theory isn't working so well! Might have to go back to the drawing board!
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:37:53
Curious question, but why are people using cex.io, Bittrex, and others that are prominent to having these kinds of problems. I use Gdax and have never seen one post on here about problems of lost money thru Gdax/coinbase. I get that Gdax only has 3 cryptos but if your only trading Bitcoin why don't people just use Gdax? Figured I'd ask!
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:48:10
yes, pretty much what I said!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:03:22
Yeah true, but my bad ass theory I wrote out, allows everyone to be right! This is a safe space zone we need to make sure everyone is included!!!!!!!

@_date: 2017-12-06 12:27:22
I mean I agree its going to correct! But fucking 5-8k you've got to be kidding me! It would take a LOT for it to dump down past 10k let alone 6 or 7k. Also with all this recent publicity, I don't see any type of major correction coming soon. The amount of new users of bitcoin every day flaws the theory of a 5-8K dump!
