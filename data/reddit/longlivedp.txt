So an open source foundation is not allowed to save for the future to guarantee long term liquidity?

Sending fake dox while using your real bank account is even more risky. That could have resulted in your bank account being frozen or even criminal charges if your are a big customer. 
Goxed if you do, goxed if you don't.

We are in dire need of systems like this.
Our governments' identity systems are crap to the point of being criminally negligent.
First they force us to use a irrevocable lifetime "private key" (eg. SS number, passport number, dob).
Then they create a system where the only way to use the private key to prove your identity is to **disclose** the private key, **making it no longer private**.
Then, to add insult to injury, they create idiotic regulations that **force** you to disclose your private key to every tom, dick and harry you do business with.

Using a client like Electrum or Multibit is not technically harder than using the Mtgox website.

I don't see bitcoin as a replacement for fiat. I don't even see it as a currency. I see it more like a DAC (decentralized autonomous corporation).  Bitcoin does a lot of things better than fiat, but fiat will always do certain things better than bitcoin. I don't see it taking up more 5% market share of fiat or commodity-backed private currencies.
Wealth distribution in bitcoin is more equal than for many corporate stocks.
Some people are going to get very rich, but oligarchy? No.

He *might* get a raise, but that is not something you can count on, the way the job market is going.  It is equally likely that he will get a pay cut when he is laid off and forced to work in a lower skill job.  
Much better to get the extra life enjoyment now than when you are physically unable to get it past 60.

All these classification attempts are just hilarious.
It's like they are asking, "which hole does this square peg fit into? The round hole, the triangular hole, or the star-shaped hole?"

I know a lot of people would disagree. That's why I said it depends on life philosophy. It's usually people who lack autonomy and vision, and don't know how to set meaningful goals for themselves.  They will sit on their ass all day unless somebody else sets goals for them.  That's why they think they need a job to be happy.  But it is possible to be busy *and* bored at the same time, is it not?

KYC/AML hurts honest people and protects the criminals (who use fake/stolen identities anyhow)

Surely Mark has implemented key stretching by now?
Surely Mark ran each password through at least million iterations of Scrypt?
You have to be naive to think he would repeat the same mistakes after the 2011 hack. 
Oh wait...

A rating system is not required for this. All that is required is redundant storage. The user should be able to set the degree of redundancy.
More redundancy = higher price = higher likelihood of retrieving the data.
You don't pay for retrieving the data. You pay for nodes to keep it stored.  If you keep moving your data from node to node, you are constantly testing their ability to retrieve the data, and you are giving them an incentive to *keep* storing your data honestly.
Depending on their needs, users can then opt for highly secure but expensive storage (eg. for encrypted bitcoin private keys), or cheap but less secure storage (eg. for cat pictures).

btc-ex has a long history of dishonesty. 
In early 2011 the owner did a DDoS attack against mtgox and wasn't even ashamed to admit this publicly! To him, DDoSsing your competitors is just a normal part of doing business.

He is 29 and he is only earning $3000 a month. Over his the rest of his entire working life he can expect to earn approx. $1.2 million. Probably less than that, considering that real wages are falling and will continue to fall for decades.
Maybe he doesn't like the idea of sacrificing his best years on the corporate treadmill, only to be discarded by the company at 50, so that somebody else can have a good life at his cost? 
Totally understandable decision. If you are careful about it, $2.5m is enough to retire on a comfortable (but not luxurious) life. And why would you live in New York if you don't need the access to the job market?

Better to be bored at home than to be bored at work. If you love you job (or aspects of it) that's a different story, but he obviously didn't.  
It depends on your personality and life philosophy, but there are plenty of non-boring activities that are almost free.  Or at least activities that are less boring than an office job.

There is a difference between using mtgox as an exchange and using mtgox as a bank.
Using them as an exchange meant high counterparty risk, but also a high reward. For a while at least, they did offer superior liquidity to any other way of exchanging bitcoins. So it was a worthwhile risk for a lot of people.
Using them as a bank meant high risk and no reward compared to just using your own wallet.
There is no rational explanation why anyone would do such a thing.

1) Economics has low universality. Because the economic system is so vastly complex and chaotic, and because it changes with culture, economic theories usually only apply within a certain paradigm, where many parameters are assumed to be fixed and unchanging.  Cryptocurrencies change many of those parameters, much like the switch from commodity money to fiat money did. The old theories must thus be adapted.
2) Economists incorrectly apply sound economic theories to bitcoin, because they don't understand the true nature of the technology. There is a lot of knee jerk reaction from people like Krugman about why it is a "bad currency". But the truth is, it's not really a currency. "Currency" is just a metaphor that we use for lack of a better word, much like we say e-mail.  Neither is it a commodity. There or no established economic theories for a whole new asset class.
3) Economic is a terrible science anyhow because it lack the ability to do control experiments.

I would like to see a Bitcoin-based replacement for CAPTCHAs.
It should work in the background, ie. the browser should send and receive bitcoins automatically, and for the user it's just a seamless experience as long as there are bitcoins in the browser's wallet.  
Websites should hold bitcoins as a "deposit" only and return them to the user after x confirmations. Not sure, but perhaps this can be automated with scripted transactions.

The simple answer is: You wouldn't.
Bitcoin is roughly at the same stage as email was in 1994. It was hard to use, required an expensive dial up subscription, and even if you had an email address, most of your friends and colleagues probably didn't. 
Bitcoin is exciting not because of what it can do right now, but because of its potential. 
Having said that, bitcoin does already have niche uses and killer apps where it offers real advantages over traditional payment systems.  These are the seeds for wider adoption, just like universities were the seeds of email adoption in 1994.
It will take a couple of years until bitcoin diffuses to an average consumer like you.  
Also, bitcoin is not a "consumer product".  It's an ideal currency for a distributed economy where most participants are not only passive consumers but also producers.

They are not a whole new asset class. They are just a *member* of an asset class, called "collectibles". They are functionally indistinguishable from postage stamps, sports cards, or works of art. Collectibles have indeed been around for hundreds of years.
