These tipping threads are such an awesome way to spread the BTC joy!

I think, since they are doing the responsible thing, not.

Manicminer.in is interesting for scrypt. It merge mines 6 coins at full speed while splitting your hash power amongst 8 main coins, based on profitability.

Thanks! I shall spread this tip far and wide!

32,169,000 kB is 30.679 GB, unless you are a hard drive manufacturer. :)

It looks like BTC-e has the most volume. --&gt; [Market List/Total Volume](

You are sharing the blockchain with the rest of the network, like a torrent. It has nothing to do with the security of your wallet. The wallet uses your local copy of the blockchain to calculate/verify your balance.

Looks like an empty lighter being used as a stand off to me.

The miners get the transaction fees. It's part of their reward for verifying all the transactions on the network.

LTC is objectively NOT better. BTC has 6 orders of magnitude more hash power than LTC, making it FAR more secure.

Because BTC has 6 orders of magnitude more hash power than LTC, making it FAR more secure. It would cost a miner wanting to game the system something on the order of a million times more money in mining hardware to game BTC vs LTC.

I had this happen the other day. Turns out a dirty shutdown had corrupted a file. Try running error checking/repair on your drive. Also, 20+ hours, or much more, is typical for a full sync of the blockchain.

The reason was NOT because they were using AsicBoost. It's because their version of AsicBoost was incompatible with segwit and they were preventing segwit's implementation.

They are permanently lost.

Perhaps anodize it and then sand it. That should be fairly permanent. There are places out there  that only charge maybe one to two dollars piece.
