As far as the production pipeline/manufacture, there is only one person and that is me. Obviously this isn't too reassuring but nothing is stored/kept after production. I guess I was using my eBay reputation/feedback record to add credibility to myself and get this off the ground, hopefully that will work. 
Not familiar with BIP38 but will look into it and implement it if possible.

Paypal is by far the worst company in the world. They hold user's funds basically ransom and cause headaches for people. They tie up money "pending review" for 180 days routinely. Steer clear of Paypal :\

We have a scratch off tamper evident coating over the private address and QR code. Similar to what is used to cover a PIN on the back of a gift card. If it does not arrive un-altered, then you know it has been tampered with. 
As for the BIP38, looking into it now!

Come up with $40 million dollars and build a huge mining farm here in the US and take control away from China?

I know there are a lot of options out there but this is one of the best ones. (Disclaimer: This is my product/website). With online wallets or any form of computer wallet you risk hackers and malware. Same with phones. Paper wallets made of paper are flimsy and easy to mess up. I got this idea when I actually destroyed (accidentally) one of my own paper wallets and lost 1.1 btc. Already listed on eBay and should be on Amazon within a couple days :)
