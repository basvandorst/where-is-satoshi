This is simply not true. My coinbase account was hacked via oauth API. It took them a little while, but coinbase made me whole out of their own funds (~30btc).

It was parked in Austin all during SXSWi.

I've been doing some digging myself. The OAuth callback URL they're using is:

As of right now, coinbasevault.com (IP 81.88.48.78) is still active. I've emailed abuse (immediately bounced) and support (nothing). I may have also identified someone involved, but I don't want to dox someone innocent, so I won't be posting that info publicly.

Adrian, 
Thanks for the response. I had considered myself a careful user by doing all of the "right" things:
1. Set up 2fa on auth
2. Set up 2fa on all transactions over a small amount
3. Verify URLs and SSL certs
And because of these things, I had a false sense of security and let my guard down. As a software developer who has written auth code, I honestly thought the OAuth screen that said "Authorize Coinbase access to your account?" button was very interesting and assumed that Coinbase had done something innovative to segment access internally within applications/internal services. I thought this was maybe an interesting security isolation feature and somehow the multi-sig news I had recently heard about was an implementation. On top of that, I seemed impossible to me that there would be an API key granted for an app called "Coinbase". 
Coinbase needs to disable OAuth be default for all users. Users need to explicitly enable it, and there needs to be granular controls on the API calls with the same protections that are given to the web interface. 
To be honest, I'm not going to feel justified until I get my funds back, as I don't feel like I've been irresponsible with my coinbase access credentials.
@_date: 2014-11-10 02:30:30
No, that's not how this worked. The page I logged into was coinbase.com, through a coinbase owned SSL certificate, and I definitely logged into coinbase. The attacker never got my password or my 2fa code. All they needed was permission from coinbase to use their API key to access my account. That's the vulnerability.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:30:52
Goddammit - don't remind me of this. I was one of those slashdotters that poo-poo'd bitcoin back in 2010. Biggest financial mistake of my lifetime so far. :)

A laptop is not the perfect place for cold storage.

Well, the "most" affordable is 30 minutes north of Austin in Cedar Park, Round Rock, or Pflugerville, but if you are moving there, you may as well not come to Austin. East side is hip and has a great vibe and is cheaper than central or south austin.

Along the same lines, the original python bittorrent code that Bram Cohen wrote is pretty awful too. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:47:07
I use KeePassX with both a passphrase and a secret file. The KPX database file is stored on dropbox so that it stays syncronized across my multiple computers, but I manually copy the secret file. It's almost 2fa for the KeePassX. I would love to have it use something like YubiKey as well.

I saw this sign today on I-35. Reading through your stance on the issues you care about, I'm 100% in agreement and would vote for you, but unfortunately am a few blocks too far west. I'll donate some BTC to the cause.

Why not just do full-disk encryption? The performance overhead is pretty low.
@_date: 2014-11-11 04:59:39
My account has been unlocked and my full balance has been restored. Thanks Coinbase.
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:33:02
That's exactly the problem. The attack was to trick the user (me) into authorizing an API application access to his/her account to an application called "Coinbase" using the coinbase logo. So the user logs into the real coinbase.com and unintentionally authorizes some other coinbase user who created the 3rd party app full API access. 
You use OAuth all of the time when you log into a site with Facebook, G+, etc, but I can guarantee you that Facebook would never give out an API key to a 3rd party application that has the word "facebook" in their name or uses the FB logo. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 06:21:29
Uh.. it sounds like they're going to make this right. I can hardly say this is shitty customer service.
@_date: 2014-09-08 05:25:57
You've only changed codes for your google account. All of the other accounts you set up on Google Authenticator has nothing to do with that "Move to a different phone" link. The time token has a seed value saved on your phone itself.
If you can get to the file system of your phone's memory, you can grab the sqlite file that stores all of your GA seed codes. It would require root probably, which is going to be hard to do without a working screen.  What kind of phone is it?
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:36:51
Kind of. The owner of the tor node would need to have an SSL certificate signed by one of the Certificate Authorities trusted by the client's browser. Otherwise, the Client &lt;-&gt; Tor connection would be encrypted, but the browser would display warnings.

Lots of people in Austin.

As an Austin resident, I'm quite happy to see this. I made a small donation.

I'll buy your gox coins at 50% rate (.5 BTC outside gox for every 1 BTC you send me on gox).

That's how OAuth works. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:01:57
I understand how bitcoin works. The point of my post is that there's a huge hole in coinbase.  There's absolutely no way that a company like Coinbase should authorize an OAuth application and allow them to use the string "coinbase" and the same logo, then allow a 3rd party access that bypasses all internal security measures like 2fa on transfers.  It's not like I authorized bitsafe or bitsecurity. 
Like it or not, the coinbases, circles, etc of the world are what is going to drive bitcoin to mass adoption. If they can't figure their shit out, than lots of people are going to be screwed before BTC is going to have any traction. You're ignorant and/or stupid if you think that bitcoin is going to be successful if it requires that everyone manage their own private keys.
@_date: 2015-05-05 04:46:48
Yeah, definitely something I can do. Give me a few weeks to clean it up and make it consumable.

Creator of coinspy.io here. Please don't rely on it at the moment for anything more than curiosity. I haven't had time to maintain it for over a year (I'm a busy CTO of a startup).  I hope to get back to making it better soon though!

Got a list of good addresses? 
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:07:35
Flask, boto, and angularJS (angularjs not needed at all, but I wanted to play with it). I'll probably just open source coinspy as soon as I add more features and add in some documentation.
@_date: 2013-12-30 06:01:40
Anyone can "subscribe" to any BTC address, so subscribing to an address is not linking you directly to ownership of that address. But, you're right that there is the possibility of association between email addresses and BTC addresses with CoinSpy. I promise not to give away any data. :)
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:01:18
Yeah.. I'll work on that today. I wanted to get the important parts working first.  
The email database is up for sale for 1m BTC. Facebook? Google? Anyone? ;)
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:03:46
Ha. Those addresses are exactly what I used for testing. I'll just leave it as-is until if and when it gets out of hand.

Hey everyone.. I just wanted to share my weekend project.  Let me know what you think or if you have any ideas for improvement. Thanks!
Also, I'm waiting on Amazon SES production access, so for now the emails may be going to your spam box. It should be fixed tomorrow.
