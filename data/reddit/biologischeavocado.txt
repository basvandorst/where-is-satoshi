It's the number of coins times the value. Then you can choose between circulating supply and total supply. The problem with ripple is that the circulating supply is huge and the total supply (which isn't shown by default) is even bigger. At the point ripple touches anywhere between $500 and $1000, it's equivalent to world GDP. For this reason (but even more so for a lot of other reasons) ripple is stupid.

They implemented bcash in a hurry. It was even possible to send bcash and get bitcoin back 1:1 via one of their apis. Quite drastic. And incompetent.
Some smaller exchanges and wallets have implemented segwit in half a day.
No, this is a big political show. The CEO is giving lipservice to his customers. They are really an enemy of bitcoin. And it makes sense, segwit, lightning, atomic swaps, decentralized exchanges, all these innovations are a threat to Coinbase. They prefer coins with a leader, like eth and bcash, something they can play and mold like a toy. They can't handle bitcoin anymore.

Market cap websites give an extremely distorted picture of reality. Alt coins have coins locked up for their founders, they have many more coins than bitcoin, or they can print more coins when they feel like it. In principle you can create an alt coin with infinite coins and sell 1 coin for $0.10. Market cap is then infinity and would push bitcoin to number 2 on the market cap list.

For a similar reason roublecoin or yuancoin is not. It's controlled by a central authority. It's a crypto currency, but with none of the advantages. (Or, from the viewpoint of the authority, with none of the disadvantages.) In biology it's called mimicry. A fly evolves to look like a wasp to scare away predators, but without the need to evolve expensive defence mechanisms. Bcash already hard forked twice. It will hard fork 3 more times this year. Hard forking can only be that easy if the coin is controlled by a central authority. Bitcoin has never hard forked. For this reason bcash can not be used as a permissionless censorship resistant money. And if not, then what's it good for? There exist thousands of alts and classical financial products that can do what bcash does, but cheaper and faster.

It's more expensive to run a node. There are 2 reports that I know of that show that each MB increase in blocksize reduces the number of nodes with some percentage after some number of months.
In the case of bcash it's much simpler. They are centralized to begin with regardless of the blocksize. The whole point of bcash is that they don't have control over the bitcoin code. They could contribute and follow the default review process, but instead they want short cuts and have their own code inserted without the review process. They can do that now with bcash.
One of the reasons to do so is to keep their asic boost relevant. Asic boost is a trick that makes it seem you secured the network, but you really didn't. Bitmain, the issuer of bcash, makes a lot of money with asic boost.

If someone steals Roger's bcash, Roger can hard fork and start again at a time before the hack. Bcash hard forked twice already, it will hardfork 3 more times in 2018. It can do that exactly because it's centralized. If someone steals Roger's bitcoin, Roger can not do anything about it.

Why would he care if bitcoin fails? That's a good thing. He has more eth than btc and no doubt he has more bch, too. He does't want to solve the btc problems, he only complains about them. It was shown a few days ago that the network would not be congested if everyone would use segwit. Bitcoin is kept as unusable as possible. The worse bitcoin does, the more money they make.

The problem is not that 3 of the 700 bitcoin developers work for blockstream, the problem is that none of the 700 developers work for companies like Coinbase. Companies like Coinbase cry the loudest about what's wrong with bitcoin, but do not contribute to the code in any way. Quite the opposite as we have seen recently with the insider trading, mempool spam, and the refusal to implement segwit.
Maybe Coinbase should care more about contributing to bitcoin than about Brian Armstrong's stash of ethereum.

BCH already hard forked twice, they'll have hard forked 5 times before the end of this year. Not only is bcash a fork of a fork, it's also not permissionless and censorship resistant. The fact that they hard fork that easily already shows that. Hard forking should be hard, if it's easy it's because it's centralized.
If the definition of NIST.gov is correct then [bclashic]( is the true bitcoin.

Coinbase is making the bitcoin experience as expensive as possible. They don't implement the available solutions to reduce fees, but use these fees to blame bitcoin. It's a narrative they are creating. One of the reasons they do so, is because their CEO is invested in ethereum (and no doubt bcash, too) and the worse bitcoin does, the more money he makes.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:49:03


Doesn't this make it worse? You can't buy cheap after dumping, because buying back increases the price just as fast. But you can wait for your future to expire after dumping and buy back after that.
In both cases you don't gain more bitcoin, but in the later case you do gain on your futures contract.
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:02:37
Number of nodes doubled and blocksize doubled. I call those numbers to be within the error bars, especially given that price increased twentyfold in that time. This is really modest compared to the GB blocks that bcash wants to use. When bcash uses 1GB blocks it can't even compete with VISA. You need to be really motivated to swap a TB disk each week and even more so to pay for the bandwidth (if it's possible at all to download that blockchain).
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:35:50
There are 2 reasons for you to increase the blocksize
* to make bitcoin hardfork and decrease its value as an immutability ledger
* to mobilize people, who don't know why this simple idea is so bad, against bitcoin

Bitcoin went up too fast, that's what I was saying. People were in awe when it doubled every 5 months. Then last month doubling rate was 1 month. And instead of realizing the ridiculousness and expecting and accepting a pull back, people are disappointed that it didn't continue. I can see another 6 months without movement just to fix the current trend.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:31:03


It's copied bitcoin code without the transaction malleability bug fixed. It's issued by Bitmain to keep their miners relevant, because these are less effective with segwit. There's nothing decentralized, immutable, or censorship resistant about it. Bitcoin makes sense is because it's decentralized, immutable, and censorship resistant. Current investors don't get that there's a difference between bitcoin and alts. They'll figure that out sooner or later, but it takes time.

Coinbase and a lot of other companies (see segwit2x) want to create the narrative that bitcoin is unusable. The point is that bitcoin really doesn't belong at those companies any more. These companies have had their function in the past when they assumed they could play and mold bitcoin like they now do with alts. They have business models and need to be able to phone these alt coin companies such as eth and bcash, to sync the pump and dumps and to maximize their returns. These exchanges don't have another function anymore.
Bitcoin is going to walk on its own. Lightning, atomic swaps, and decentralized exchanges are going to maken that happen. All these innovations are plain threats to exchanges like Coinbase, which explains why they frustrate bitcoin progress so much.

But that's not true. You miss out on new features, but it will still work. Only in case of a hard fork, you must update. AFAIK the plan is to do as much with soft forks as possible, this could even include block size increases.
Coinbase, blockchain.info, and bitpay are bad actors, because the innovations in bitcoin (segwit, lightning, atomic swaps, decentralized exchanges) are a threat to their business models. You can not force them to play nice, because they have no incentive to do so. They are enemies of bitcoin and your proposal will not change that.

You don't see people shilling for other alts in this sub. You only see bcash shills. And that's because bcash feeds from the confusion between bitcoin and bcash.
Bcash could be a honest attempt, they could do development, they could try to have an advantage. Then this would all be fine.
But they don't do development, they're waiting for lightning to be ready so that they can copy that. They don't have an advantage, all alt coins are faster and cheaper. What they do have is a marketing machine. They compare bcash with bitcoin on points that are not important for this revolution. You can already send money fast and cheap. And bcash isn't even fast, it still has 10 minute block times.

Your best bet is to stay out off it completely or buy and hold for a few years. If it dips dramatically, which it will, buy more.
If you decide to buy, just buy and don't start looking at the screen waiting for the perfect moment, because on shorter time scales it's all very much random movement that doesn't provide any information. Buy in chunks to smear out risk over time.
Also, fees are huge. Investing in chuncks of $50 isn't really feasible. Be prepared to lose it all. If you aren't invester you should buy and hold for a few years and not trade. Trading is mostly a game of moving money to people with more money, more patience, better tools, better friends, and robots. You'll win that game maybe once and then lose it all. Holding is the only way to keep control over your coins.

Ver and Wu have been frustrating bitcoin forever. Now it's bcash, it used to be Unlimited, Classic, and XT. It's just the next attempt. And as such it's not like any alt. The only thing they are interested in is the bitcoin name, because that brand has so much value. And that's why they freak out when it's called bcash. They don't provide anything to the space, they only take away.
You pretent to be agnostic about it, but how much of your open mind is based on the technology and people behind it, and how much is based on the current price rise. The technology is copied/stolen and half if not all the people behind it are criminals. It also does not provide a new use case compared to other alts. It's compared to bitcoin because of the butcoin name. But it's not a better bitcoin, it's a worse litecoin. It's slower and more expensive.

Asicboost only has an advantage relative to other miners on the same chain, not other chains. The reason that bcash is sometimes more profitable to mine has to do with difficulty, the number if miners, and price of the coin.
Coinbase doesn't implement segwit, because the current path of bitcoin isn't really aligned with their business model. Coinbase makes money off of the functionality that's going to be implemented on top of segwit in the next few years (lightning and decentralized exchanges). Also their CEO is invested in eth and has every incentive to see bitcoin fail, as we've seen with the bcash insider trading and the crashing of bitcoin directly afer.

Bcash is the worst solution for cheap and fast payments. It's not cheap and it's not fast (top table).
Bitcoin has a completely different use case (bottom table). It's nice if we have cheap and fast payments, but they can't be done on the blockchain. Bcash does it nevertheless, but it's stupid. Apart from that, they are centralized (Bitmain) and should use mySql or whatever. Much better than a blockchain if you're centralized. Bcash is a temporary solution that has been solved many times in the past. Except it does it worse. It can scale to VISA levels, but not much beyond that. And it's exactly beyond VISA where the new and interesting applications are.
It's a nothing coin. It doesn't contribute to anything except Bitmain's business model and Roger Ver's pockets. It has a huge marketing budget and that's the only reason you hear so much about it. The bitcoin name is used as the fuel to get their business going. It's a shortcut. They have no interest in bitcoin. They use it because the name is so valuable and it's not trade marked.

Roger is a broken record. He already has bitcoin(.)com, rbtc, and  And what does he use it for? To sell a scam issued by a company in Beijing. Several months ago he offered reddit $100k for rbitcoin. He wants total control over yet another channel with bitcoin in the name to shill his Chinese bitcoin.
Once Roger is the moderator of this subreddit, discussion will be bcash only. He gives gold to favorable comments and uses bots to mark comments he doesn’t like, which are then easily recognized and downvoted by an army of helpers.

Possibly, but what would they accomplish. The people who want to do harm anyway don't care that it's illegal. And the honest people are put at a disadvantage compared to other countries. You can pay taxes with bitcoin in Switzerland. It's a legal payment method in Japan. CME got involved. Wallstreet wants to get in. New companies create jobs and pay taxes. Everyone is getting exited about this exceptional growth and everyone wants a bit of it. It's in my opinion not going to replace the fiat system and as such it's no thread. It's more like a convenient form of gold.
If they can make it illegal and enforce it, then as a society we are in trouble regardless of bitcoin, because you need a totalitarian state for that.

Exchanges and brokers take a cut and the rest is miner fees. The miner fees are high at the moment. It's possible to use a wallet that allows you to set a lower fee (people use way too high fees), but only if you send bitcoin. If you receive bitcoin, you can't control what the sender pays. Also, the more inputs are combined to create the output, the higer the miner fee. Investments on the lower side like your $50 are really damaged by fees.

In my opinion, which hasn't changed since forever, is that in this market you buy and hold a few years. If bitcoin crashes, you buy a bit more. Unless trading is your thing, you don't touch your bitcoin. Don't believe shit that competitors are better or whatever. Don't react to FUD on the news.
Three things can happen. The one that happens every few weeks is a big FUD campaign to make you sell your bitcoin. Ignore that. The second thing is that bitcoin may have a technical failure. This hasn't happened ever. And the third thing is that governments make it illegal. The latter is probably unlikely, because it's starting to get such a huge business opportunity, and many governments want a piece of that. So, you have some expectation of your investment. Say you put in $100. It fails completely $0 20%, it's made illegal $0 20%, it goes to $100k 60%. In that case the expectation is therefore (0+0+$60k)/$15k = 4. In other words, it's expected that $100 turns into $400. This is much better than a lottery, which has an expectation that's smaller than 1, which means you're expected to lose money.

That's because nobody knows bitmain, but everybody knows bitcoin. Bitmain is the name they have, bitcoin's the name they want. It's a private enterprise that wants a valuable name. It's similar to a company using the google name or the coca cola name. The difference is that google and coca cola are trade marked. Bitcoin is not and they basically take the name from hundreds of volunteers who worked for years, simply because they can.
Don't get mistaken, bcash has nothing to do with the bitcoin philosophy. If you think about what bcash really is, it's a really distopian future of central control and complete lack of privacy.

Ver made this a problem by comparing his nothing coin with bitcoin on this one single issue. The irony is that bcash performs worse on that issue if compared with anything else. Bcash is really the worst solution to cheap and fast transactions out there. Want cheaper fees and faster transactions? Use Litecoin or Apple Pay.
When bitcoin had the volume that bcash currently has, it has fees of less than $0.01 (compated to $0.30 for bcash now).
Bcash trolls and pisses off the intelligent people and scams those who aren't as quick or can't invest as much time.
The reason why bitcoin is a thing, is because it's a permissionless, immutable, and censorship resistant money. It's freedom to control what you own and it's freedom of speech in that one can support good causes that a bad government disagrees with. Everything else is nice to have.

For everyone not getting it. Asicboost is Bitmain's strategy to monopolize the miner market. Asicboost and segwit do not go together, hence segwit allows competitors to enter the miner market, too. What bcash did was create their own bcash altcoin that still works with asicboost. So, one of the reasons for bcash is to make sure those asicboost miners can still be sold. Another reason for bcash is that it in principle will not get 2nd layers. Those layers improve privacy and that's not in line with the ideas of the Chinese government (Bitmain's a Chinese company).

Even though $ increases, it only drops relative to bitcoin. It catched up a little recently, but only a little. The security of eth is not ok as we've seen in the past year. There are other reasons as well, such as financial contracts that would make perfect sense for bitcoin but less so on eth, because the token is less valuable. And again, the security is an issue, in case of bitcoin the rootstock chain is separate from the blockchain and can't do as much damage if something goes wrong. You have ICOs yes, but these are regulated out of existance. And other use cases are almost none existant. Now, I can be a Ludite here, but if crypto kitties was an iphone app, would you pay $0.99 for it? Scaling is also an issue. It's already practically impossible to download the eth blockchain. Again, I can be a Ludite here, maybe it will be solved. But still, it just doesn't make very much sense to me.

Then there's Wu, who wants to sell his asicboost miners. Segwit is a pain for asicboost and more importantly, they need a coin that won't ever change proof of work, because it would make the miners obsolete. Wu has yet another problem, which is in fact the biggest if all and he's scared as hell of it, and that's privacy. He knows his bitcoin business's a dead end in China. Even though bitcoin isn't anonymous, future layers will allow anonymous transactions. Bcash on the other hand will not get these layers and the blockchain itself is transparent. This is exactly what the Chinese government could tolerate. And as such he can keep his business safe. Not surprisingly, their close allies Craigh Wright and Jeff Garzik, are involved in businesses that develop chain analysis software.

Bcash is an altcoin that has nothing to do with Satoshi’s vision of cutting out the middle man. It’s Chinese Bitcoin. It has a liquidity as low as Litecoin and 5 times lower than Ethereum, mostly traded on zero fee exchanges (Roger Ver trading with himself to push the price up) and artificially kept at a 1:10 price ratio. It’s issued by Bitmain in Beijing, which has an enormous stash of it. Enough that they burn some percentage of it to artificially reduce inflation and prevent the price from falling too much. Like Visa and Paypal, bcash is a business, the middle man. That’s the big difference with bitcoin.

They have been using asicboost to mine bitcoin and that's why they've been opposing segwit for two years. Now segwit is enabled on the bitcoin chain, they can't use asicboost anymore. They can still mine bitcoin, but it's now equally difficult for them as it is for other mining pools. If they can get people crazy enough to believe that bcash is bitcoin, they have full control over the code and their investments in the technology are safe.
It's unclear if they are making money from bcash, because I don't know how to do the calculations. There's a cost in pumping the coin, but there can be huge gains as well. The CEO of Bitmain has said that they were doing extremely well. So, they probably are making money off of it. It's still not clear what their end goal is. Just yesterday there was an article about turning bcash into a big tech company and using targeted ads in peope's wallets to generate revenues. According to the article, each user would be worth $5 per year.
They are clearly steering away from the bitcoin philosophy. But to become a mega company like google or facebook, they need to get global recognition. They use a shortcut for that and that's to hijack the bitcoin name. Basically they use years of hard work of volunteers for their own benefit, because they can get away with it. The bitcoin name is not trade marked. They basically have this strategy of splitting the population into two groups. One group exists of bitcoin uses. They know they can't fool them. And the other part is the group that's less quick and doesn't have time to keep up with the news. This group can be fooled and they specifically focus on that group for example by creating a very negative narrative of bitcoin and putting bcash forward as the savior coin.

A protocol that allows you to make payments to anyone in the world. Unlike Paypal or Visa it has no owner. Bitcoin will at most have 21 million coins, less than there are millionaires in the world. Bitcoin can not be inflated or cencored. On top of bitcoin new applications are built, the most famous one being the lightning network, which works basically by delaying bitcoin transactions. LN has much lower fees and is much faster, but can only be used for low value purchases. Bitcoin is mainly suited for high value transfer. I think in the future most people will see LN as bitcoin and LN will be the only thing they ever interact with.

I would like to add that bcash claims to have lower fees, but Jihan Wu tweeted that segwit fees are “unfairly cheap”. So, they try to be cheaper than segwit, which was unfairly cheap. This only makes sense if they subsidize bcash, which is what they are doing as the investor deck shows.
AFAIK bcash has one developer, which was recently banned from some bcash forum, because of a disagreement with faketoshi.
What’s wrong about bcash, except from it being a business that does not need a blockchain (VISA and Paypal don’t use a blockchain), is that they are scooping up all domain names with bitcoin in it. They have rbtc,  bitcoin(.)com and Roger Ver just last month or so offered Reddit $100k to buy rbitcoin. Supposedly to combat censorship, but the actual reason is of course to replace bitcoin with bcash.
Except from a money grab, bcash is also a means for Bitmain to survive in China. China hates bitcoin, but seems to be ok with bcash. That alone tells you something’s not ok with bcash. The reason you hear so much about bcash and not about the other 1500+ altcoins is because the bcash marketing budget is so huge.

Scaling is a function of blocktime and number of transactions in a block. New techniques like schnorr and possibly mimblewimble will squeeze more transactions in a block.

Yes, that major bcash community is artificial for the biggest part. The reason you hear so much about bcash and not about the other 1500+ coins, is because the marketing budget for bcash is so huge.

Intrinsic motivation can be much more powerful than a monetary incentive. At the very least it creates this unique product that’s owned by no-one. And only bitcoin is owned by no-one, everything else has a leader or is a business.


You’ll not get cheaper transactions on chain. And it’s also not the goal of bcash. Jihan Wu (the boss of Bitmain) tweeted that segwit transactions are “unfairly cheap”. It’s clear that they are subsidizing the fees now to push bcash adoption. This is at the expense of decentralization. And let’s be real, centralized products like VISA and Paypal can do very cheap transactions until they must meet investor’s expectations every 3 months.

Basically you create a number by doing a coin flip 256 times. That’s the private key. That number is then converted to an address. You go to an exchange, pay them money, and they will move some of their bitcoin to your address. Now nobody can move those coins except you, because you have the private key.
A paper wallet has the private key and public address printed on a piece of paper. Usually it also prints a QR code, which contains the same information and can be scanned with a phone or laptop camera.
The coins are not stored on the paper wallet, they are stored on the blockchain. The paper wallet only allows you to move them to another address.
In the case of a hardware wallet, such as a trezor or ledger nano s, it also has this private key, but it converts it to a word list to make it easier for you to write down and store somewhere safe. Unlike a paper wallet, the hardware wallet uses the private key to generate new private keys. So, you only need to keep the first one safe as a backup.
Always buy a hardware wallet directly from the supplier, never from ebay.

I can list flaws, inconveniences, and threats. On the other hand I see bitcoin as a machine that once turned on can not be turned off. Similar to AI when it reaches a particular treshold. Or climate change. It can be mitigated for a time, but very hard to stop completely. That said, who knows what financial derivatives will be invented that actually can stop it. I also see the 21 million cap. There are less bitcoins than there are billionaires on Earth. Then again, cryptography may break one day. But the fact that it’s unlikely to be stopped and has a 21 million cap balances out all other worries I have. I’m not saying we can put our feet on the table and watch tv, though.

Your question was about the future. Most people in the future will not even know that LN settles on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-03 22:00:44
New technologies such as multisig will in theory put a near infinite number of transactions in the same 2MB we have now. Bitcoin transactions will be expensive by then, but the price secures the network. Fees do not exist to be nice to miners, but to secure the network. If fees are low, miners will drop out, difficulty will adjust, the same number of blocks will be mined per hour, but the network will be less secure. That’s why zero fee can’t work. At the moment fees are subsidized by inflation, but that will change fast in the comming years.
Also, Florida will be under water by then thanks to climate change, so it’s not all bad.

You need to run your own node to verify your transactions. If you use a SPV, you’re trusting someone else. But in this case your node would see the malicious chain as the correct one because it’s the longest.
@_date: 2018-08-20 11:43:16
Two studies last year showed that even a small increase pushes down the number of nodes quickly. It’s not about most people or about businesses with resources, it’s about people who want to verify their own transactions. Most people in the future will start using LN and not even know that there’s a settlement layer underneath.
New techniques will make bigger blocks unnecessary. In principle you can combine a near infinite amount of transactions in blocks of current size.
There’s also no reason to care. There are a thousand parameters in bitcoin. The only reason this is made into such a big deal is because bcash has it and they are marketing it as a feature to a non-technical audience.

It would look really bad if it dropped below 0.1 BTC, which is why they prevent it from falling lower. It’s an illiquid coin, which means it can be kept at any value relatively easy with not too much money. Bitmain has a lot of bcash and some time ago they started burning new coins to reduce inflation. They can’t sell it, because it’s so illiquid and price would go down fast.

Let’s hope bitcoin will make people realize subsidized fossil fuels will kill us all. Fossil fuels do not contain much energy, they barely produce the energy for the current civilization. There’s no way energy production can go up 100x or 1000x with fossil fuels. And burning those fuels anyway will put enormous strains on food production and international relations. It’s a threat multiplier. And in fact burning it all will turn this planet into Venus. The sun got much hotter during its life span and Earth is at the inner edge of the habitable zone, which is not what you want.

It’s about expected value. The expected value of a lottery ticket is less than the price you paid for it. The expected value of a bitcoin is greater than the price you paid for it. Suppose the probability that people lose interest is 30%, the probability that price gets stuck thanks to all kinds of financial instruments is 60%, and the probability that it goes to $330,000 (mktcap of gold) is 10%. This still makes the expected value $36k.

Roger has been frustrating bitcoin forever. Bcash is nothing new. He tried to hijack it with XT, Classic, and BU. And finally there was bcash. In August of last year, Beijing based Bitmain was forced to give up a 30% mining advantage and became afraid of a government that absolutely detests bitcoin. Bitmain’s answer was bcash: good for the advantage and good for the Chinese government. Their conviction was that they only needed to convince 10% of people to drop the cash part of the name and continue as bitcoin. In reality bcash is a private company like Ripple and has nothing to do with bitcoin. Roger took this as a new opportunity. He was gifted (most likely) or bought a substantial amount of bcash before August 1 and made this his new project.
What Roger Ver does is not bitcoin, but marketing (let’s use this word as an euphemism) and he doesn’t care what it is he markets. It could be fireworks just as well. Whatever is available.
Roger is one of those persons who are very nice to you when you meet them, but what has a lot of people puzzled is that people who got lucky normally don’t stick a knife in the back of the community that made them rich.

If you buy such small amounts you should leave them on an exchange and only move them to your own wallet when the total is like 0.01 or so.

It was relevant in that it enabled segwit. Segwit was unable to activate the normal way because a some large percentage of the network had to agree. But Bitmain was dominant in the Chinese media and advised miners against it saying that segwit transactions are “unfairly cheap”.

Bcash is a company and should be discussed in r/cryptocurrency together with the other 1500+ altcoins. The reason you hear so much about bcash and not about the other alts is because the marketing budget of bcash is so huge. The reason bcash hasn’t dropped to $3 like the other 50 bitcoin forks is because Bitmain props up the price at a loss as can be seen in the investor deck. The fact that the Chinese government is ok with bcash, while it detests bitcoin, tells you all you need to know. Bcash is a worse litecoin. Why bcash and not litecoin?

The current miner fees are subsidized by inflation. But this will quickly change in the comming years. Fees in Satoshis will probably stay the same, in dollars they will go up. The blockchain will not be used for small transactions. Most people in the future will use lightning network and not even know what bitcoin is. In case of bcash, fees are subsidized by Bitmain as can be seen in the investor deck. There’s no way Bitmain will keep subsidizing bcash with this much money if they ever get a monopoly.
The work of the founder of Blockstream has been critical for the invention of bitcoin. Blockstream employees are like scientists. Nchain and Bitmain, the companies behind bcash, are patent trolls and marketing artists.
Validation time is a security feature. If you accept zero confirmations and 4% hashrate, you get less security. Same for the fees. No fees means no security.

On the other hand, the gold scenario is presented as a nearly flat line at the bottom of the chart with the text “This is why linear scale adoption curves are silly. Same sources (and curve) as above.”. What is “this” exactly in the chart, and why is it “silly”? I wonder if they can even explain this without saying “that’s obvious”, because if you can’t it’s not obvious. And the gold scenario will still mean bitcoin will reach $330,000.

She’s talking about bad financialization were unbacked claims (paper bitcoins) depress the price of a scarce good as they did with gold and silver. These are now entering the market, as was in the news yesterday (the bakkt-ice-nyse-starbuck-microsoft news). This is only solved if hodlers don’t allow their bitcoin to be leveraged by these institutions, ie. don’t give out your private keys to 3rd parties (exchanges, lending). Or if those custodians have a bitcoin address that can be inspected by everyone, which is something they will refuse to do, because it will make them less money. Or if bitcoin is forked to make the paper bitcoin worthless for those who don’t own the underlying asset. I guess people have to transfer their coins to the new one as a proof of ownership and the old one will start petering away. Imagine if all gold bugs could do that to gold to get rid of the paper claims.

Bcash is a company, like all other financial products are companies. Bitcoin is a protocol that’s owned by no-one. It’s not about a better product. They can’t be compared.

Roger’s a salesman. It happens to be bcash, it used to be fireworks, but it can be anything. Bcash is optimized as a miner coin, code is written by paid programmers, it allows covert asic boost, it’s not optimized for 2nd layers that may depress the fees, it’s not optimized for future privacy features. It’s controlled to such extent that even the Chinese government is ok with it.
It’s nothing like Satoshi’s message in the genesis block. It’s not a good product. It’s a worse litecoin. Which is fine. But they don’t want to be a worse litecoin. They also don’t want to wait 10 years to grow their brand. No, instead they use the bitcoin name as a shortcut, buy up all domains with bitcoin in the name (did you know Roger offered Reddit $100k a few months back to buy this subreddit?), and try to trick people in buying bcash.
Normally consumers wouldn’t accept a product like this, but the space is so new, and the learning curve so steep, that people are easily tricked. The bcash product is exactly that, it’s a trick that will work until buyers get their shit together.

It’s nice to blame someone else. Reality is that these polar caps are melted by $5T in fossil fuel subsidies. People conveniently rationalize away their energy consumption when watching tv, driving 0.5 miles to the store, and flying to some nice piece of nature in Asia for their holiday.
Energy consumption is going up by orders of magnitude and fossil fuels can not do that, but they have incentives to burn it all, because those who control the oil control the world. If those fossil fuels are burnt anyway we’ll see geopolitical tensions go parabolic when the climate starts interfering with food production and places to live.

It’s not as liquid as bitcoin and there’s a huge 25x lever that moves the marketcap by a lot even if just a little bit of money flows in.
Bitmain (the issuer of bitcoin, which also pays the developers and manages the hard forks), has huge piles of money. Their revenue last year was $4 billion and they have been mining a quarter if not more of all bitcoins for years. They have all the money they need to pump the price of bcash. They also burn bcash coins to decrease the supply and push up the prices through deflation. Add to that the fact that a lot of the sell pressure’s already gone, because many sold early.
For a speculator it may be a lucrative tool, but as a sound money it’s anything but.

There’s no way fossil fuels can contribute to the future energy growth. Humanity will increase energy consumption by 100x or 1000x or whatever. Fossil fuels do currently 1x and already are reason for serious worry. Climate change is a threat multiplier, it will decrease the probability that we’ll survive the century without major war.

First thing you should know is that "main" and "split" are two ways of looking at the BCH wallet. They do not do anything. I think those captions are not very well chosen, because "split" is also a verb and one might think it performs an action. I would have called them "mixed" and "separated".

Then some grifter's worth billions and he gets a refund.
The wealthiest do pollute the most though. By far.
The starving argument is a temporary effect. Millions and eventually billions will starve or overheat thanks to the ecosystem that's being destroyed by the wealthiest pillaging the world for the cheapest labor and resources in order to make the largest possible profits, which is then used to buy political power and eliminate competition.

You need some professionals to look at it, but as a simple person I would say things like this:
Embrace unions.
Don't always rule in favor of corporations.
Take money out of politics. What's best for corporations is different from what's best for humanity. Even if the difference is ever so slightly, if this gap is not closed in some form or the other it will destroy us all, for example in the form of a corporate fascist state.
If you profit from the fact that China subsidizes shipping, manufacturing, and labor, then compensate for the damage it causes (because China uses more coal for example)
Don't subsidize Walmart by having the government give $6B in food stamps to employees.
Make the price of fossil fuels equal to the damage they do to the future economy.
Don't force NASA to buy broken parts from Boeing. This is just using procurement to subsidize corporations with tax payer money.
Don't let corporations be the sole profiteers from tax payer funded fundamental research.
Compensate for loss of healthy years, life expectancy in the Netherlands is up to 18 months less than what it could be thanks to air pollution.
At the same time electric vehicles are discouraged because they don't know how to rake in taxes from vehicles that don't run on gas. Anyway.
Cut out propaganda such as the obsession with drugs.
Don't allow marketing that separates suffering from the product. If you have a farm that treats cows like Coca Cola does, don't allow smiling cows on the package. Sounds stupid, but one of the biggest problems in my opinion is that suffering is outsourced to people and beings that have no money or no rights. and that these are made invisible.

And about oil. It's tied to the USD and allows the US to devalue it's currency and build an economy on debt without affecting the exchange rate. This also explains the forever wars and the fact that SA can fly its citizens into a building and kill a journalist and the US doesn't care. It cares that Iran is selling oil to China in a currency that isn't the dollar though. It may be impossible to get rid of oil for this reason.

I don't agree that it's under your control. You have to work for it to get it under your control. Some forks are malicious, require malicious software, require your public key to be exposed. Tax authorities could make a fork themselves and sell 1 billionth of a coin to themselves for $1. At that point each bitcoin could be taxed for $1 billion. They make the rules, but if applied this way it's done for intimidation and discouragement. A decade or two ago housewifes where jailed for unknowingly sharing half a dozen mp3s. It's probably like that.

None. They are all crazy people talking from their underbelly.

Stephan Livera if you want the occasional rant about lazy people not working. Noded if you can bear listening to the toxicity of Bitstein. Trace Mayer if you want advise from someone in a private jet who says an investment should never interfere with principles (which means his advise will not align with your best interests) and challenges you to prove climate change. Whatbitcoindid if you can stand the babble and the lack of research. World crypto network and crypto cast network, I don't even know if they still exist, I certainly hope not.

POW change levels the playing field for all ASIC manufacturers. That’s really bad. New manufacturers will see their investments become worthless, while not having earned a penny yet. While Bitmain, with its obsolete miners and a lot of money, sees its competition disappear. It will result in new manufacturers with no product and no money, and Bitmain with a lot of money and products that are obsolete anyway. Bitmain doesn’t care and everyone else is fucked.
POW change will make bitcoin worthless overnight. A lot of hash power will go to bcash, making it possibly the alt coin with the most work ever.

Buying and selling bitcoin is like buying and selling Yuan or Euro. Liquidating is something else and involves leverage trading, it's unlikely you figure out how that works when you simply try to buy bitcoin, and it requires a dedicated exchange such as Bitmex.
Everyone wants to buy low and sell high, then buy low again, but the future is not predictable, you don't know when it's low and when it's high, you only know that of the past. Moreover, your emotions will tell you to buy and sell at the exact worst moments.

The price of electricity is relevant, not the amount of electricity. And electricity from fossil fuels is too cheap. People believe we will remove CO2 from the atmosphere at the price of $600 per ton, but at the same time they say a $30 per ton carbon tax is impossible.
This is all politics. They want to burn those fossil fuels so bad and fossil fuels will be burned for as long as they are the cheapest form of energy. But they are not really the cheapest, because the effects on water, air (10,000 deaths per day), and climate change (negative economic growth, famine, refugees) are not included in the price of fossil fuels. The net result is that fossil fuels in Western society are in effect subsidized more than renewables.

Bitcoin can not be controlled by a private party or a government.
It's a machine that has been set into motion, can not be stopped, and it's pretty much a one way valve for money, money will keep flowing in until the reservoir's full. What is full we don't know. It may already be full, it may not be full until $1M+.
Inside the system you are free to do what you want. Outside is the legacy system. The interface between both systems is a barrier for most people.

Everyone thinks there will be an all time high by the end of 2021. This is not financial advice. The only thing you can do is ride the wave. It's very much possible you buy now and then at some point between now and the next few months it drops to $6k or lower. This is part of the randomness in the trend. It's very difficult to time it if at all, that's why many here don't trade. Be aware that bitcoin can drop to zero overnight and you lose everything.

The budget for +1.5 'C is already reached. At +1.6 'C the greenland ice sheet will irreversibly melt and lead to a sea level rise of 7.2 meter although melting will take many centuries.

Nowadays your wallet will handle that for you. Several years ago when paper wallets where all the rage, people kept sending money to the same address. This is valid, but it has disadvantages for privacy and quantum computing. Don't worry about that.

It's possible that he feels that the left, the liberals, or whatever threaten his Christian beliefs by gravitating towards facts and away from magical thinking.
By reframing the right to have a personal identity as a violation of free speech, he has hit the rhetorical jackpot (the kind that resonates with his base at least) that allows him to discredit the group that embraces the facts he feels threatened by.
I hope it's that and not something more sinister. Wanting to be part of something bigger by believing in a creator is one thing, wanting to be part of something bigger by believing in a white fascist state is another.

He's a great story teller and he makes some interesting points. He also confuses his opponent by stringing his arguments together in a dishonest way. The confused opponent then starts arguing about something irrelevant and Peterson can take over the conversation. Peterson has won and his opponent can't recover. The entire scene then becomes proof of the "dangerous and unhinged" left.
But he has risen to divine status after appealing to the liberal value of free speech by opposing Bill C-16. However his objections have nothing to do with free speech. Quite the opposite. And his base does not care about freedom, democracy, or diversity. They care about race, a made up history in which everything was better (but never existed), masculinity, and a charismatic leader.
However, for those who do care about free speech this is a very sensitive subject, so they tend to shut up. Especially those in the center who do not recognize the dog whistles give the "victims of the left's oppression" the benefit of the doubt.
Peterson sees the left as a threat to "Western society" which is a dog whistle for "too many non-whites and liberal ideas".

You can easily prove that something’s Turing complete by having it run a program that’s known to be Turing complete. The more recently found programs are very simple and hence they can run on very simple machines. That doesn’t make it practical however. One can build a Turing complete machine that nevertheless needs a billion man hours to program and another billion years to compute 1 + 1.
Edit: I see it’s from Fake Satoshi. So what he does is regurgitate the work of others to sound interesting (it’s interesting, but not his work and almost a century old) and then prove something which is trivial to do (no accomplishment at all), which is irrelevant for all practical purposes just to be anal about bitcoin being labeled not Turing complete.

Similarly to how bcash is not bitcoin, is Peterson's version of free speech not free speech. The law he whines about protects the individual and restricts the governement.
Peterson's not allowed to "deny services, employment, accommodation and similar benefits to individuals based on their gender identity or gender expression" in his position of power as an employee of a university that is payed by the governement (tax payer).
In his free time however, he can do what he likes, because protection of free speech is such a crucial right.
So, the neurotic person that he is, he flips out, makes a video about it, which resonates in his crowd (that only hears what it wants to hear), and now he's milking it dry and cashing out.
That he is now seen as a symbol of free speech is cringeworthy.

That’s the point of bitmain cash. Otherwise they would have given it another name, like the thousand other altcoins that have unique names.
Bitmain Cash is a coin issued by Bitmain and marketed by Roger Ver. Roger Ver got incredible rich thanks to bitcoin, but for some reason his entire career is based on frustrating progress and adoption as much as possible. The most likely reason he hates bitcoin so much is because he can get more money fooling people into buying his scams.

It's a disgusting display of milking the censorship and free speech card. Peterson deliberately spins his own interpretation of the law. In reality the law restricts the government and protects the individual. During working hours, in a job paid by tax money, he can not refuse people's rights based on gender identity. During working hours, Peterson can not favor white males over other people. This is clearly not about Peterson's free speech, it's about other people's free speech and Peterson falsely claims to be the victim while reality is the opposite.

New technologies could in theory put almost an infinite amount of transactions in a 1MB block. In practise this is a bit harder, but this nevertheless makes me believe that bitcoin will never get very big blocks, not even in the far future.
You can not live without fees, because it prevents people from using the blockchain as a cheap but reliable storage device. And the second reason is that a fee market must be developed to keep mining profitable in the future. Otherwise bitcoin is not secured.

Bcash is always dropping. But it needs to be at around 0.1 bitcoin to not look like a failure. So Bitmain doesn’t sell the huge stack of bcash they have and Roger Ver just buys bcash to keep the price up as we’ve seen when he was a guest at CNBC and Alex Jones. Bcash has no liquidity so it’s easy to keep the price at a steady level.

On-chain scaling requires bigger blocks, which makes it more expensive to run a node. Non-Alibaba nodes start to drop off quickly when blocks exceed 4 MB. To reach VISA level scaling you need 4000 MB blocks. But this doesn’t allow any new use cases. I want to pay a website for as long as I have my tab open. I don’t want to pay a $0.30 fee every time I want to listen to an extra minute of music. Besides, VISA level scaling is many orders of magnitude too low to address all transaction for all humans and machines in the future.
Another reason is privacy. On-chain scaling records all transactions on the blockchain.

I don't get that argument at all. Mining is supposed to be expensive, that's why this works. If electricity cost drops to zero, the network isn't secured anymore, because it becomes trivial to cheat. If miners get very efficient, you just need more of them to keep the network secure.

It requires energy to make it more expensive to cheat than to play fair. If energy would be free or if miners would be infinitely efficient, cheating would be cheap. It doesn’t simply require energy, it requires people to pay for that energy and the ones who cheat have to pay much more than the ones that don’t.

Bcash is an altcoin with an extremely large marketing budget. The reason you hear so much about it and not about the other altcoins is exactly for this reason. The reason bcash has “bitcoin” in the name is to leech off the bitcoin name, which is very valuable like Coca Cola, but not a protected trademark. If it was called Litecoin Cash, it would be worth nothing. A better name is Bitmain Cash, because Bitmain is the company that issues the coin.
Bcash itself is not necessarily bad, although it’s pretty much a toy coin that doesn’t solve a real life problem (any alt can do the same), but the people behind it are all shady. This makes it very much look like a scam and given their previous projects, I’m convinced it actually is.

There are other ways to do that without increasing the blocksize. Multisig is one that can in theory put an arbitrary amount of transactions in a block without increasing the block size.

@_date: 2018-03-25 02:34:59
With new tech I mean multisig. This sounds like a smart contract, but what it really is, is a means to combine multiple signatures before thay are put on the blockchain. In theory you can combine all signatures in the world into a single signature. In practise, it’s a bit harder to do.
I don’t know exact numbers and it depends. As a rule of thumb one can predict that fees on the blockchain will only go up, even with bigger block. Unless the coin’s not used, which would be worse.

Bitcoin is a machine that once turned on, can’t be turned off. AI, once sufficiently mature, will be another example of such technology.
Bitcoin doesn’t care about investors, price, or competing cryptos, it just grinds its way into the future.
By the same metric, alt coins have no significance. They look similar to confuse the buyer, but have totally different fundamentals. They are owned by businesses and can be changed by their owners and regulators. Alt coins may do well for a long time, because many people don’t understand what they buy, they just listen to CNBC or youtube. The messages they send out just confirm what the audience already believed. This makes them watch their ads. But any medium of exchange except maybe the Zimbabwean dollar can drive out those altcoins given a decade or so.

Bitcoin doesn’t compete with altcoins. Bitcoin competes with the dollar. Altcoins try to confuse and often scam people by trying to be like bitcoin, but better, having more bells and whistles. But they are all businesses, like VISA and Paypal, with founders licking their fingers. Bitcoin’s the only one that’s not a business.

They call it bitcoin segwit, which means they are working from the bcash bullet list, which has strict naming conventions.
At that point you know it’s not a honest rebuttal. It’s an effort to confuse new people in the space, who rely on more experienced people to guide them. Unfortunately not all people are honest and the nicest people are often the most dishonest (which makes sense if you think about it).
It’s really sad, because the bitcoin learning curve is steep enough already. The thing we do not need is the bcash marketing team deliberately confusing new people with the goal to maximize profits for Bitmain and to slow down adoption of sound money (bitcoin).

The simplest, just to get you started with a small amount, install breadwallet on your iphone, write down the 12 words (if you install breadwallet on another phone you’ll need those), click bitcoin, click receive, go to some place like  send some bitcoin to the breadwallet address. Then if you want to sell some bitcoin, the site talks about a miner fee. This means that whatever you send, you need to send a bit more. Breadwallet will do that for you automatically. This small extra bit of bitcoin goes to the miner that mines your block.
If you can do that, but a ledger nano s or a trezor.

Bcash is a coin created and controlled by a company. There’s no block size debate, there are people who want a decentralized, immutable, and censorship resistant money, and there are people who want to run a business. One of those 1500+ businesses is bcash. The only difference between bcash and the others is the name and the amount of money they have for marketing. The idea that the 4 bcash billionaires want to make a better coin or save poor people is absurd. They want to make money.

I don’t know if Coinbase allows transfers with an email address. If so, it has nothing to do with bitcoin.
There’s a public key, a private key, and a blockchain. The bitcoins are stored on the blockchain, and the private key allows you to move bitcoin on the blockchain. The public key is a number created from the private key, and the private key is just a random number of 256 bits long.
There’s nothing special about the private key until you actually transfer bitcoin to it’s corresponding address.
Your wallet asks you to write down a word list. The wallet itself also uses this list. It basically turns the words into a number, adds 1, and then hashes the result. This will be the 1st private key. For the next one, it adds 2, and so on.
A hash just means some number goes in, some number comes out. But unlike a normal function like sine or square root where you can do the opposite function and find the input again, that’s not possible with a hash.
There used to be a site that simply printed 2 QR codes. One for the private key, and one for the public key. The private key can always be used to find the public key, so the public key is a bit redundant. This piece of paper was enough to own any amount of bitcoin. Those sites are inheritly insecure and the one I’m talking about is labeled a fishing site by google, but they did show the very basics rather well.

Evidence or a narrative? Bitmain, the company that issues bcash, made over 2 billion $ last year. Ver alone is worth about a billion $.

Compare it with litecoin for example, it’s slower, more expensive to transact, and accepted almost nowhere except at bitmain itself. Why are they doing that?

Bitcoin has a feedback loop, every two weeks the bitcoin clock is put back to 12.5 btc every 10 minutes. If everyone would start mining with very cheap electricity the hash rate would go up and more btc is mined in those two weeks. More money. But after those 2 weeks the bitcoin clock is put back to 12.5 btc every 10 minutes. So everyone is mining at a higher rate but the miners get the same amount of btc as two weeks ago.
The opposite is also true, make electricity more expensive and the hash rate will go down. Electricity and hash rate are proxies for the price you pay to keep the network safe.

Nobody seems to be interested in attacking bcash, but to be as secure as bitcoin you need to multiply the number of confirmations by the ratio of hash power. This means bcash needs a hundred or so confirmations. My guess is that bcash said fuck it, there’s no point, skip all of them. They also want cheap fees, which means nobody wants to pay for security, which means there will be no security.

Written in the year bitcoin was released.
Mind you that bitcoin(.)com, Roger Ver, and Bitmain are all part of a business called bcash. They steal the bitcoin name to gain credibility. Otherwise they would be as popular as the other 1500+ alt coins.
Bitcoin’s open source, immutable, censorship resistant, sound money. Bcash is a commercial product that exist to slow down adoption of sound money and to introduce security flaws into an open source project. Bitmain operates from China. The Chinese government is opposed to everything bitcoin stands for. Bcash however was recently integrated into a chat app owned by the Chinese government.
Note that bcash controls  bitcoin(.)com, and rbtc, which all promote bcash and hate on bitcoin. Roger Ver now wants the rbitcoin subreddit too to promote bcash. That’s why he says it’s censored and he’s offering reddit money to hand over ownership to him.

The idea that those 4 lying billionaires created bcash to help the poor or prevent babies from dying is rediculous. Bcash exists to keep Bitmain’s miners mining at a 30% advantage. It’s a business decision. Bitmain has been frustrating bitcoin upgrades for two years, because it would kill their advantage. They made millions for each day they were able to stall the upgrade. Now it’s a multi billion $ company and shifting it’s focus to surveillance chips. It’s a selfish, evil, and distopian company.

The whole value proposition of bitcoin is that nobody can change the 21 million bitcoins. If you look at bcash on the other hand, it has forked 4 times already, one or two people decide when to fork it. They hire Alibaba servers to run the nodes, and mine the coins themselves. They can increase the total supply whenever they want. But they’ll never do that you say?

It's the price of electricity that's important, not computing power. The amount of computing power will go up or down depending on the price. Miners pay money for electricity and if they play fair they get bitcoin back, which they can sell for money. If they do not play fair, they'll lose the money they've used for electricity. It's a system in which playing fair gains you more than cheating.

I didn't read the entire thing.
If bitcoin uses 0.3% of electricity production at $10k, will it use 3% at $100k? 30% at $1M?
What happens if new techniques allow the number of transactions per block to increase a thousandfold? This potentially allows for a thousandfold increase in energy expenditure.
Reality is that we're putting a lot of energy into something without knowing how much is needed. Bcash is never attacked even though it's a piece of cake to do so.
And what's this? The banking system uses 2340/3.6=650 times the energy of the bitcoin network. If bitcoin uses 0.3% of the world electricity production, the banking system uses an equivalent of 195%.

Bitmain cash started pumping after Ver’s tweet about wanting to buy rbitcoin in order to “restore free speech” (shill bcash without opposition).

That's in fact free speech and it's ugly, but it's not something a government of a free country can do anything about.
The problem with Ver is that he demands that others promote his scams for free. And those who refuse are accused of being the enemies of free speech. If ver is in favor of free speech, he should allow critique and accept that not everyone agrees with his narrative.
So, Ver's ideas about free speech are the opposite of what they actually are. Ver accuses others of what he does himself. Ver himself doesn't allow critique and exactly that's what free speech is about.

Has bcash blocks that are empty?


You mean the peer to peer cash part. The irony is that bcash is not that. Peer to peer is not about cheap fees, it’s about eliminating the 3rd party. And bcash isn’t trying to do that. Quite the contrary, it discourages users from running nodes, wants to move nodes to specialized and expensive datacenters, and Roger Ver said he’s perfectly fine with PayPal 2.0. The goal of bcash is not peer to peer cash.


Bcash has fucked up a lot of Satoshi’s plan. Relaxing the blocksize cap is one. Being owned by a corporation in Beijing is one.


Exactly. The probability that you take something complex that doesn’t work too badly and fix it with your idiotic intervention, which is what bcash does, is zero.

That way you can steer the coin in the direction of your business model instead of the other way around. And that’s why Coinbase, BitPay, etc. want something that’s owned, like bcash or segwit2x.
Block size is just a marketing tool that can easily be communicated to the public. Reality is that these blocks cripple the security model in favor of linear scaling. And linear scaling suck, it won’t be able to do a paradigm shift like paying per second, it will scale only to a size like VISA and the likes, something we already have.

BCH has 1 to 4 GB blocks at the point it reaches VISA level scaling. That’s 1000 times bigger than the current BTC blocks. Suppose your rent is $500 per month. Then it gets to $500,000 per month. A factor of thousand is a lot. And they are talking about TB blocks already, which is a million times increase. But This level of scaling is still only VISA level. So, you can do some remittances and such, but paying for coffee on a global level? Meh. And doing the really interesting stuff we can’t do today, such as paying $0.01 for reading an article, or paying a movie per second, or paying a taxi per meter, things that are going to create a new economy, you can’t do that.
But again, BCH vs BTC is not about technology, it’s about politics. BCH could be a honest coin, but it isn’t. On the top of the BCH pyramid there are some truly shady and dishonest business people.

That they shill bcash is one thing, but they explicitly do so by harassing the members of this sub (private messages) and by trashing bitcoin. This is still a bitcoin sub and people should be able to discuss bitcoin without being harassed.
The bcash business model is based on destroying bitcoin. Both  and bitcoin(.)com are owned by Roger Ver and spout anti bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.

Segwit was stalled for a year, mainly by Bitmain, which is the issuer of bcash. Bitmain has enough control in China that many other miners assumed that everthing that company puts out in the media is true.
The problem with Segwit is that it bricks covert asicboost, i.e. it decreases the efficiency of Bitmains miners. So, they issued this coin that still works with covert asicboost.
Just issuing a coin is not enough, it drops to zero. What they did was use every success bitcoin had and project it onto themselves. And at the same time trash bitcoin whenever they can.
They can do that because they have such huge amounts of money. Bitmain must have a substantial percentage of all bitcoin and on top of that their revenue last year was about $4 billion. And their cheerleader Roger Ver may on his own be worth maybe another $1 billion.
Roger is very aggressive against bitcoin. He controls bitcoin(.)com and  Both these channels spout anti-bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.
The goal of bcash is to kill off bitcoin. That’s their business model.
The problem with bcash is that it’s a centralized coin that does the same thousands of other coins do. And it’s not even good at it. From an organic growth perspective, bcash can not be in the top 20. It has no merit, they took the bitcoin code, made it less secure, and started marketing the hell out of it. It should drop to $3.50. But then again, it’s growth is not organic. One of the things you see is that they start burning coins to boost deflation and that Bitmain does not sell the bcash it mines, because the value would then drop below 10% of bitcoin.
It’s a scam, because they claim to be something they’re not. They’re not bitcoin and they don’t care about other people’s babies, which is ine if the reasons for bcash according to Ver. They care about money and probably the kick of the scamming process itself.

It’s an altcoin with an enormous marketing budget and access to several of the most valuable media outlets. That’s why you hear a lot about bcash, but not about the other alts.
Marketing is what they do. The coin itself is not particularly valuable, it’s centralized (hard forks on a whim), and not faster or cheaper than litecoin.
The reason bitcoin is interesting is because it’s owned by no-one. And this is also the only reason. Bcash has a clear group of owners (of which Ver, Wu, and Wright are the most visible) with no honest vision.

BCH is one of the 1000+ altcoins. The reason you hear so much about it is because they have such a huge marketing budget (literally billions of dollars) that’s used to confuse newbies in the space.
It’s slower and more expensive to transact than Litecoin. So, from a technical point of view it doesn’t make sense.

As I said, the censorship is at the bcash side. That side buys all bitcoin domains, bitcoin(.)com,  rbtc, to silence any opposition and shill the bcash scam, which isn’t even bitcoin.
Bcash exists because Bitmain operates from Beijing and they are afraid of privacy or the prospect of it. Jihan has said so himself. It would kill his business. How can Chinese bitcoin aka bcash be embraced by a government that banned bitcoin? A bit strange don’t you think? Because bcash is fully transparent and impossible to develop privacy features for. What do you think the IA products will be for that bitmain is developping.

Roger Ver’s and his sockpuppets have only one goal and that’s to make this sub unusable as a milestone on the roadmap to destroying bitcoin completely.
That they shill bcash is one thing, but they explicitly do so by harassing the members of this sub (private messages) and by trashing bitcoin. This is still a bitcoin sub and people should be able to discuss bitcoin without being harassed.
The bcash business model is based on destroying bitcoin. Roger Ver wants this sub to be like  and bitcoin(.)com that are owned by Roger Ver and spout anti bitcoin propaganda every minute of the day.
Other alts don’t do that, only bcash does this.
You don't want 100 partying hooligans destroying your house, either.

Roger not only owns rbtc, but also  and bitcoin(.)com, which spout this misinformation every minute of the day. He now tries to buy rbitcoin.
Bitcoin cash is however an altcoin created by a company in Beijing. Roger does the marketing. The goal for bcash is to take over the bitcoin name and destroy bitcoin itself.
The reason you hear so much about bitcoin cash, but not about the other altcoins, is because the marketing budget is so huge (it’s literally billions of dollars) and because Roger has all these powerful media outlets.
It’s an attack basically by someone who has a lot of money.

BCH is no different from the financial institutions we already know, like PayPal, VISA, and so on.

BCH has clear actors that gain from it (Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, Bitmain, Faketoshi, and several others who are not as well known).
BTC on the other hand is something we don’t already have. BTC is a protocol to send money everywhere in the world, but is owned by no-one.

You can do that, but you’ve not been active in rbitcoin. You’ve been active in rbtc and then come here and do some damage control for bcash.


A miner is not a node. Bitmain (the issuer of bcash) already has pretty much control over mining. Both BCH and BTC.

Why not turn the current PayPal, VISA, etc, into something we want? You know why? Because money. It’s not going to happen. They can turn bcash in an ad driven model, it was already calculated that each user is worth $5 per year.

If you think any other system will let you play with bitcoin, you're very naive. Besides, I don't think you realize how difficult it already is to get bitcoin in the US compared to a "socialist nanny state" like the Netherlands. For example, we don't need to email a copy of a passport to the exchange to get bitcoins, we don't have to wait a month for approval, it takes less than a day for the exchange to put the money into our bank account, and we don't even pay tax everytime we sell it. The only tax we pay over bitcoin is 30% of a ficticious return of 4% per year. That's 1.3%. Think about that.

Please rephrase this lie and I may give an actual answer. The only ones you "lowly Americans" are defending and paying taxes for are the very rich that are now in power. It's not to build new infrastructure, provide universal healthcare, and work towards a sustainable economy. You believe that NASA has child slaves on Mars for fucks sake. The only reason you've these fucking militairy bases EVERYWHERE in the world has everything to do with your tax payer subsidised industrial militairy complex. The only reason you're in a perpetual war (7 at the moment) is for this reason. There's no reason to build aircraft carriers to fight terrorist. They're build to secure the world's energy reserves. That's the only thing the US is interested in. The US doesn't give a fuck about security in Europe.

Bitcoin's a system to send value over the Internet directly from person to person or from device to device. It was predicted years before it was invented, like the memristor and the Higgs boson. It was kind of hard to do, not at all like creating a casino chip with a number on it.
It does not need to be tangible. Media isn't tangible, communication isn't tangible, being intelligent isn't tangible, kindness isn't tangible. Still, we value these things. Often directly expressed as a monthly fee.
It does not need to have intrinsic value. Gold does not really have intrinsic value, it can only be used for bling bling and chip wires. The reason I value gold, is because everyone else values gold. I don't care for aluminum coins, because no one else does. Though, there was a time when aluminum was more valuable than gold. Diamonds have no real intrinsic value except when glued to the tip of an oil drill. They do have symbolic value, but if I'm alone on an island, they're useless. A monkey prefers a banana over a trillion $ diamond.
The most important requirement is that it needs to be rare. Like sea shells can be money on a mountain top. Well, bitcoin's the only rare thing on the internet.

The downside is that people with mobile phones but without expensive data plans can not verify the blockchain.
Big blocks are a red herring. Bcash blocks are empty. Litecoin's a better bcash, what's the difference.

Imagine a bank with a spreadsheet in which for each account the amount of fiat is stored. In the case of bitcoin, the spreadsheet is not owned by a bank, but it's owned by no-one. Also, in the case of bitcoin, the total amount is fixed at 21 million. This means that bitcoin can not be censored and that it's inflationary.

Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, echoed a similar view last week but didn’t do it quite as colorfully.
Last Thursday night bitcoin crashed by about $1,000, to around $7,000. Bitcoin will soon be worth zero. But until then criminals will still be able to use it and other digital currency to move money around the world without being caught.

Yeah, but millionaire Peterson likes getting money from people who don't make their beds or wash their balls.
He has also tragically become a symbol of free speech, which is the world turned upside down given the fact that the law he's whining about protects the individual by putting restrictions on the government. The conservative interpretation of free speech is that critique is limiting their free speech. But critique is free speech. A scientist warning about climate change or a journalist calling out Trumps lies is not limiting your free speech. You want the scientist and the journalist to shut up by claiming it is.
A lot of people just assume that proto fascist shit to be true, because they listen to it the entire day. You get war. People die. The war ends. Rinse repeat.
For example, when the president calls the press the enemy of the people, because his lies get called out. Here's an overview of when that phrase was uttered:
    2   Marxist–Leninist states
    2.1 Soviet Union
    2.2 China

It's a double standard. Make people pay the true price for fossil fuels and bitcoin will use less energy. The energy the bitcoin network uses is directly related to the price people pay to keep it safe. It's not energy, it's price.
The hypocrisy of the west with respect to climate change is shameful. It becomes perfectly clear when you propose to tax those who actually pollute. For example, you can redistribute a carbon fee on fossil fuels. Those who pollute a lot, pay a lot. But everyone who pollutes less than average comes out ahead.
There are few proposals that get less hate than this one. Rather than confronting ourselves with the truth, we cover our ears or blame the poor.
The 10% wealthiest contribute to 50% of the carbon emissions. The poorest 50% only contribute 10%. Each of those in the top 10% uses the energy equivalent of 600 slaves, but surely the problems must be caused by the poorest half of the world, those who sit in the dark at night.
Fact is, you can't squeeze climate goals out of the poorest people who pollute the least.

It's a law that restricts the government and protects the individual, which is exactly the thing a government is supposed to do. Peterson doesn't explain the law properly, because that undermines the point he tries to make.

To be specific, he leaves out pieces of the story that don't match his narrative. He attacks others for it, which is fine, even though he does it more to own them than to get the argument right.

Because the other party has just been owned and because he is more intelligent than his opponent, they fail to point out his obvious omission and errors.

Progressives are not organized well enough for this. Progressives are an amalgam of all kinds of different groups and ethnicities. The right on the other hand is a homogeneous group that has well defined objectives, money, and projects such as fox news to get where they want to be. The freedom the right talks about only exists for themselves, the freedom to pillage and pollute. It’s as non existent as their fiscal responsibility.


That’s when the recessions of the past half century started. There was enormous growth until then.

It's a typical case of [DARVO]( You're putting yourself (white male) in a victim role. Even though many white males live in poverty and are left behind, they have never in history been a repressed group and still aren't the repressed group. It's a nationalist dog whistle. The only group that supresses white males is the billionair class that is now in power. The trick they use it to set up poor people against other poor people (like the immigrants at the border) to keep them distracted, while they pillage and pollute the world and take down unions. They don't care about white males in poverty, but they make them believe they do.

It's a low effort attempt to replicate the success of bitcoin while using the tools of the legacy system. Bcash has owners and is as such the same as any altcoin, visa, and apple pay. The only difference is the name, instead of litecoin or ripple it's named after bitcoin. And the only reason it's well know  is because of the marketing money. Bitcoin gold for example has little money and it shows.

Republicans know how to craft a coherent message that appeals to an audience that is disgruntled. One of the bullets in their play book is that they are misrepresented in the media and that the media is "left" and "socialist". The fact that these words have become poisonous is not because they are necessarily bad (they may be bad, they may not), but because republicans decided to make them poisonous as part of their coherent message.
The thing is that republicans are a minority that wouldn't even get 10% of the votes if people would vote in their own interest, in the interest of their country, and in the interest of the world. They know very well they can't win on policy and that's why they play a different game, in which billionaires play the victim card to gain sympathy from a population that has to work 2 jobs to keep afloat. Not to mention voter suppression and gerrymandering.
Being harsh about criticism is fine, calling the press the enemy of the people is disturbing given the history of that phrase.

Bitcoin requires an offer to keep the network safe. The fact that this contributes to climate change says that fossil fuels are too cheap. Make them more expensive. But you've been voting for market policies and deregulation for 40 years and you've ignored that there's also something as a society. Well, the market is eating society now.

No, the shit is how he deliberately leaves out parts of his arguments to prevent that his opinions fall apart.
Peterson has a job in a government funded position and he's paid to not be an ass in that professional setting and that comes with some rules. If he doesn't like that he can complain about it, which is free speech, and in his free time he can do whatever he wants. Being such a drama queen about so few people makes no sense other than dog whistling.
The problem is not free speech, but the use of the word free speech to shock people into submission who actually believe free speech is important.

First of all it fills a gap in technology. It was predicted before it was invented. Will it be like electricity or like beanie babies? We'll know 100 years from now.
Secondly, it's the only way to operate outside the system. That can be a good thing (freedom of speech, gain access to a financial system) or a bad thing (financing dubious practises). In any case it has a use.
The internet used to have just as bad a reputation back then as bitcoin has now. It was for criminals and people believed hotmail was for porn.

It means a message that is deliberately crafted to be understood differently by two people depending on their situation. It's not a different opinion. People who profit from tax cuts know that poor people do not profit, because they pay almost no tax and especially not the kind of tax the wealthy are worried about. So the dog whistle is added to make people believe the tax cuts are necessary to keep migrants out and keep your jobs. Stocks are at all time highs, the sad economic situation of half the US is not caused by several thousand migrants at the Mexican border. It's also not caused by the Chinese or the Europeans. It's caused by the predatory nature of the corporation. Both the dems and the republicans feed this system. They'll both drive us over the precipice into a totalitarian corporate state, but the republicans will do it faster.
Too bad the partisan, tribal nature of the population leaves no room for observation, history, or facts. I look at it in some form of sad amusement. The world is a giant ant farm, every ant occupied with only it's neighbours, many charlatans pointing them in useless directions. Is this human experiment going to self destruct or not.
