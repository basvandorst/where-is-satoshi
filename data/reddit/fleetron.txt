you actual problem here was not using a password manager and making a unique password or ebery important site.
use the weak passwords on jerkitforme.com and save the unique passwords for blockchain.info and shiticouldbeblackmailedfor.net
you should also check if you have anyone connected to your computer. something like 
     netstat -anob

How do you not see that as a huge flaw? There are only 4-5 pools minting blocks now, do you not see that huge gaping problem?
Regular people don't give any fucks about the reason why it takes so long.

weird. You have 491 on my side.

inline JS?
I've noticed it running for maybe 2 weeks, but now it's even more than it was before. how is it being automated?

Haha! Nice, how long's it been?

I think so, but the upvotes aren't actually counting, only the downvotes.
So it's effectively costing us karma to post. XD

Uh, what else do you do when you don't need a job and get to jerk off all day long? I mean, video games get a little boring, until a new one comes out, balls need recharging, not enough on netflix or good movies to torrent. Programming is mostly confusing as shit, and need drugs to figure anything out, poker starts feeling like work, and again, the balls always need recharging. Can't really hangout with anyone cuz they're all at work and hate you anyway since you don't have to.
What else is there to do, but to fuck off on reddit?

I recently just started using dogecoin, and even though I think the whole meme idea is retarded AF, it takes 3 minutes to get 6 confirms. Sometimes less, sometimes more, but never more than 5 minutes. It could be faster but this, is excellent. 
While with bitcoin, mathematically it takes no less than 1 hour for 6 confirms. but this is not the case IRL because it's usually about 2-3 hours and I've around since 09, so it's not like I'm just making shit up. It was actually faster when the network wasn't just 5 nodes minting. I'm also currently waiting on a deposit of NMC that's taken 8 hours so far, which is merged!
This is honestly a huge problem that is not being addressed simply because of money, and that is exactly the kind of thing we are supposed to be against. Just like the miner fees, the only reason we have fees right now, is for something 130-150 years from now, and I don't really think anyone thinks bitcoin will be around then unless it's simply for nostalgia.

takes fucking forever for 6 confirmations also. Especially now that we now others can do the same functionality, and it only takes 2 minutes.
