Lightning solves this I think?

Who's the author? Satoshi? ;)

This talk opened my eyes for what Blockstack is really about. I'm always skeptical about new things claiming to solve big problems, and therefor I was initially skeptical about Blockstack. "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". This talk explains some of the "evidence" for how Blockstack works and it convinced me to further investigate and learn about how this truly decentralized DNS layer on top of Bitcoin works. I strongly recommend skeptics to watch this!

Muneeb talked about that, did you watch the video?

Read the title along with the song

I interpret Muneebs answer as he's referring to sidechains anchored in the Bitcoin blockchain as a proposed solution to scaling.

Yes I think so, though it would probably have to be a light blockstack client.

brg444 exactly my thought! The rest of the economy is completely left out of the simulation, like it's all about miners. Miners serve ONE purpose only, that is to create blocks. It is the bitcoin users who has the real power to decide about forks.

Namecoin stores data directly in the blockchain, that leads to blockchain bloat. The Bitcoin blockchain is by far the most secure and decentralized out there. Read more about it here:

I'm thinking that would require some central service to collect users transactions and then combine them into a single transaction. That would not be very decentralized. However maybe some sort of CoinJoin-like system is possible?

I think it's interesting research, but I'm skeptic of the quality of the research because they made a such a huge mistake not considering the ordering of transactions in a block when designing Graphene:

Maybe the reason they don't want to use the hardfork bit is because they don't want SPV nodes to be able to easily detect the hard fork? Thus luring economic activity to segwit2x chain.

Huge stage, lightshow, big monitors, fire canons...
Guess who's funding this big spectacle of nonsense?
It is the brainwashed people who's fallen for this pyramid scheme who are paying.
This is merely a display of the Pharaoh's riches stolen from the victims. Makes me sick to watch.
