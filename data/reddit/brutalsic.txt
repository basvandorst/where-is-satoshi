Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. If it ever succeeds and bitcoin becomes the standard.
We will see the biggest diflationary crisis ever.
The reason:
Lets say everyone will want bitcoin(the new gold)
This means its price will always grow.
1)Now, why will you sell something or buy with it assets that you know tomorrow will worth 10% more? 
If you dont buy anything then a lot of jobs will be lost, because you spending money is someone else job. Velocity of money keeps the capitalsm system alive.
2) No one will give you loans.
Why will someone give you a loan on a currency with supplyf 31million only?  Imagine btc being the new standard every day its price will be growing by 20%. 
How will you be able to repay him back plus the interest if he loans you a bitcoin?
Imagine you take 1btc for loan and you need to repay back in a year 1.2btc.
But the price of Btc lets say against land or milk or your salary per year has increased by 400% in a year. (Im not comparing it with dollar because in this scenario BTC is the new standard)
3) Conclusion
No one will spend it except for basic needs.
Jobs will be lost, no one will be spending on restaurants buying every new tech coming on market.
We call it Deflationary crisis.
Note: Please debate me on a healthy tone. I might be wrong I start this debate to learn not argue :)
