Do you know how fast it will sell?
I guess I am more concerned for selling because I will hold for a period of time.
If it takes a week to sell that would be very disappointing!

I know this isn't in the spirit of donations...but is there a way to donate in bitcoin and have this count toward tax deductions? 
I am just curious. I don't even do my own taxes yet...still a student!
Sorry for my ignorance if anything is off :X

I have bought and I understand it taking a while, but it is my first time buying and my coins have not come in.
I was wondering how long it takes to have sales transactions of bitcoin go through, 1 hour maybe?

Agreed! It's like going to another country, since I am not familiar with the currency I'm constantly converting it back to USD. 
We will constantly be converting it back to whatever our fiat currency is until BTC has been around from the start of a generation.

For my verification it was my checkings account. They sent me two transaction amounts of under $1 and you answer what the amounts are on coinbase and then you are verified.

Anyone look into peerbet.org? the 50/50 seems to have a correct payout, even though the bets are smaller you can just do a lot of them. Am I missing something or should this be more popular?

Where do you set auto buys and sells? So far I am only experienced with coinbase because it was easy to get verified.
