Hi I'm from the year 2050 and boy can I tell you how much I wish I bought BTC when it was only 50k
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:54:59
Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 one day, oh my!

I hear that shit is highly addictive! Just one time and you're hooked for life! And if you over consume it you'll asphyxiate! Plus it makes your break lines go, corrodes many metals, is present in cancer cells, and can cause your skin to wrinkle/shrivel after prolonged exposure!!!! Let's ban it!

Sad thing is I wanted to back in 2013 and I never did. I just hopped in and bought .2 at $9800 a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:36:32
I'm waiting for the 30k -&gt; 50k -&gt; 15k -&gt; 100k -&gt; 60k -&gt; 300k -&gt; 1M
Edit: I zoomed out super far

Any chance you can explain what you mean by litecoin being a testbed for bitcoin? Does that not imply litecoin *could* (probably won't) hit a breakthrough/revolutionary change and become the "new bitcoin"? Or would bitcoin jump on it instantly and have the larger user base and thus grow off it far faster than litecoin ever could?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:24
I know people are telling you to wait, and I don't necessarily disagree, but the entire concept of dollar cost averaging is to NOT wait. You buy on a fixed time schedule so that the dips and rises become averaged. If you start to do things like waiting for a dip you're now playing a whole different game. You're betting you can predict the market - what if that dip doesn't come? Do you keep waiting? How long do you wait? Make sure you have answers to these questions before you decide to wait for a dip.

If you're planning on holding for a seriously extended time period the same end result can be achieved by buying monthly honestly.
Edit: I tend to work quite a bit of overtime at my job. 4-12 hours a week. At the end of every month I'm going to be putting 50% of my OT earnings into BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:29:43
Hey man I've been considering doing the same. I've been smoking a pack a day at $11/pack for the last 5 years. It's gotten to the point where I wake up feeling like shit, cough garbage up throughout the day, and I'm starting to see it affect my teeth/gums. I'm rooting for you and I hope all goes well. Like you said, even if BTC drops to $0 at least you're cancer free!
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:22:00
This actually just blew my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:08
And ONE day a $10 movement will be big because it's our base currency.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:49:32
Tho one day hopefully it's a checking account
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:30:13
Tho I'm a hodler I have to say you're slightly flawed here. If BTC goes down to 9,000 and he buys and then sells at 10,000 and this repeats itself a few times he just made more than you or I did. I still plan to hold mine till the moon but don't discredit others with biased math.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:34:25
I think he's trying to say by the time a satoshi is $1 that $1 in the future will be equal to $.00001 today (1/1000 of a penny or 1/100000 of a dollar). 
E.g. In the year 20xx the US dollar will be .001% of its current value. Definitely a weird way to have put it tho.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:07:16
I'm also fairly new to understanding the technical aspects of BTC but I believe a major benefit to scaling difficulty is that you can't have a "gold rush". If bitcoin were to be suddenly $100,000 (such as when it went from $1,000 to $10,000) you don't want a ton of miners to show up and increase the supply out of nowhere. The more miners that show up, the more difficult it is to mine, the less bitcoin that gets generated per amount of processing power put in.

But the government creates a different type of debt which backs fist currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:58:31
Maybe a stupid question but is the price going down due to the amount printed? Not the other way around?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:02:14
I think the implication is $30 is not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things and you'd be crazy not to invest more. That's not to say he knows your financial situation or is implying it more seriously than as a joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:14:57
I like you.

You genius! You're getting people to hodl till they die so those bitcoins are lost forever! The year 2100 is a long way off

Even as a joke - not funny.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:17:16
This is good advice if you thing BTC will go down over the next few years (but still up in the grand scheme of things) otherwise you should just put those payments toward the loan and keep your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:23:21
Wait a second, maybe bitcoins price isn't going up at all and all of fiat is just going down! I'm not growing to gigantic proportions, I'm just shrinking everything else!

Woah could've sworn I did, mobile Reddit still eludes me on occasion. Outdated phones and all that.

I mean taking out a second mortgage is never* a good idea for anything that isn’t an absolute necessity. But let’s be honest here, if you dollar cost averaged from 2016 to 2019 you’re fine. Even if you’re one of those people that thinks they can time they market (you can’t) WHY would you dump all of your money into something when it is at its all time high? That’s just a lack of common sense.
*according to my point of view at least
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:32:13
I think what you’re saying here here is if you buy at 10k then it goes down to 7k and you sell and take your 3k loss if it goes down to 3k you saved yourself money/got more coins.
10k (buy) -&gt; 7k (sell) -&gt; 3k (buy)
What you’re missing is what if you buy at 10k, it goes down to 7k, you sell, and then it goes up to 15k?
10k (buy) -&gt; 7k (sell) -&gt; 15k (buy???)
You don’t know if bitcoin is going up or down at any given moment. And if you do then yeah of course you’ll get rich timing the market but that’s true about anything.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:18:46
I think the part that you’re missing is that if the fed wants to start playing games with the dollar, if inflation keeps spiraling, if dollars keep getting printed infinitely, etc this will all still affect tether.
One (probably oversimplified) example: I can take 10 dollars and buy a chair (bitcoin). If the dollar inflated and  in 30 years that chair now costs 100 dollars - I can sell the chair for 100 dollars.
If I take 10 dollars (worth exactly 1 pair of socks) and buy 40 quarters (tether) and the dollar inflated over the next 30 years I can sell those 40 quarters for exactly 10 dollars which is worth exactly 1/10 of a pair of socks.
Hope this made sense.
@_date: 2019-11-20 13:33:01
I suppose that would mean bitcoin is worth $0? Only way a satoshi could be worth a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 18:05:07
Any chance Xi Jin Ping is quite literally testing the waters for how much he can bend the market? Or is openly bending it? I’d love to see some data on the sell volume of the Chinese based miners when he was talking about adopting blockchain. Did the miners quickly unload? How much purchasing has happened in China after discussions about banning BTC? Perhaps it has nothing to do with getting rid of weak hands on the HODLer end of things but they are trying to get rid of weak hands in the mining industry to lower difficulty to be able to mine more rapidly after killing off smaller mining groups?
Many many options. I don’t think the Chinese are unaware of how much their stance COULD affect price. Whether or not it does is a separate discussion but it has a real possibility to and I doubt they are frivolously making these decisions. People are smarter than we expect them to be at these levels - it smells like there is some sort of a plan here.
Edit: Also thanks for trying to start a discussion about something other than $7000 today omgomg. This sub used to be so much more than that.

Wish this was more common knowledge than it is. Fantastic advice here for anyone who stumbles upon it.

 I recommend studying up on dollar cost averaging. Basic premise is that if you believe something is a good long term investment then you’re better off putting in x amount every y period of time. IE put in $100 every month. If bitcoin drops to $1,000 a coin.. put in $100 a month. If it’s at $200,000 a coin.. put in $100 a month. Don’t wait for “the right time” but rather start today. Right now. But study up on what bitcoin is a little first so you know if you’re comfortable saying to yourself that it is a good long term investment. Don’t let some random reddit user tell you what to invest your hard earned money in or when to either.
I personally dollar cost average but when I see that it drops and is (what I consider to be) undervalued I’ll throw a little extra at it. This is technically against the concept of dollar cost averaging but I’m comfortable with this “light” version of timing the market for my personal risk assessment. Note that I do not ever sell my bitcoin if I can help it.
My version of dollar cost averaging (beyond the light bit of timing the market mentioned above) is slightly unorthodox. I work in an industry where I have consistent amounts of overtime available to me. I work minimum 8 hours of overtime in a 2 week pay period but I generally work 24 hours of overtime in a 2 week pay period. Every 2 weeks when I get my check I take 50% of the overtime I earned and put it into bitcoin. In this example the “x” amount isn’t a set dollar amount but rather a set percentage of the extra income I am making from overtime. There are many unique ways to bend this system that are still a balanced investment strategy if you can get creative. Again this is a little against the heart of the concept of dollar cost averaging but it is in line with my comfort level (and due to the low fluctuation in my amount of OT it generally comes out to a similar dollar amount every two weeks anyway)
Best of luck and study up my friend! I’m by no means the most knowledgeable on the subject but feel free to PM me if you have some fairly general/newbie questions. Otherwise if you dig past the memes in this sub there are some incredibly knowledgeable people! I also HIGHLY recommend watching any videos of Andreas Antonopoulos - he’s incredibly knowledgeable (disclaimer: with a clear pro bitcoin bias).
Edit: Clarity - long message on phone didn’t proof read well enough.

Tbh blocking and banning FUD posts isn’t the answer imo. That’s silencing those who disagree with you and it creates an echo chamber. If someone has thought out, intelligent, and supported reasoning they should be able to post it.
The REAL problem is on both sides of the coin (pun intended). We’ve been seeing both pro-bitcoin and anti-bitcoin posts that are SUPER lower effort lately (always?) and that is the stuff I want to see blocked/removed. If someone posts “omg bitcoin is dead wats wrong with you peoplleee??” - remove it. If someone posts “bitcoin going to 1 million where’s my lambo wooooo!” - remove it.

Hey were you a big bitcoin fan beforehand and your whole family knew? Or is this your first step into bitcoin and if so I’m amazed 15 members of your family finally got you into it ;)
Congrats and happy birthday!!

He’s arguing that while he may be bullish (never said he is) the fake news is on both sides. He’s not turning on “his side” but rather pointing out that everyone is throwing out psuedo facts lately.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:20:13
Honestly you're probably fine keeping .02 on coinbase for a while. I wouldn't worry much at all. You're far more likely to see that .02 turn into $2k by this time next year than you are to have it stolen.
