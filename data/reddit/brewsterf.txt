I think it depends. When financial crashes happens its time for alot of people to liquidate assets if they have been overlevereged in other markets or deep in debt in general. Obviously BTC would be one of such assets that could be liquidated which puts negative pressure on price in such scenarios.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:28:08
Only trading is banned afaik. You are still free to use it and send it around if you have some. Correct me if im wrong.

This was the reason Weiss gave Bitcoin a C


But that is a feature not a bug. These guys dont understand crypto at all. Its supposed to be censorship resistant which is why its hard to change.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:02:28
Can someone explain why the mempool is so consistent? You would think with fees $10+ it would go down pretty fast but as soon as a block is found there is instantly enough $10+ paying transactions to fill the next block. Why is that? Why are people seemingly not doing less transactions at these fee levels?
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:17:41
the thing about bitcoin is that if everyone is buying and holding it you kinda have to do it as well. because if it becomes money of sorts its a mandatory asset. Its kind of strange how that works.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:32:17
be fearful when others are greedy. People are still greedy. Let this go DEEP before you buy and hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-14 08:53:58
It will likely be ready before then (i believe you can already use it if you compile the latest version). But the reason its not completely ready/officially released yet is probably because of segwit2x which pushed back everything.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:05:05
Id say bitcoin hits the 30-40 demographic because these are people who have worked for a bit and saved up, probably thinking about the future and retirement and so on. And the fiat system just isnt sound enough. It could be gone in 20 years. This is where Bitcoin comes in, and although its still kind of new and nobody knows where its at in 20 years, it is worth putting some money into it because it seems promising.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:51:05
Happy new years everyone. 2018 will be pivotal for BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:32:33
Fees have only been high for a few weeks. As people adopt segwit and optimise transaction use they are gonna come down. It probably doesent help that every altcoin have an incentive to spam btc to push up fees so they can create a narrative. This is just a phase tho and i suspect its coming to an end. heres to a 2018 with lower fees and mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:19:19
I bet that if/when BCASH falls below 0.1 the bitcoin spam will start again

they could stay the same per tx er even be lower than today but there could be more transactions in each block by then so miners maek money still

Does anyone know of any serious flex cap ideas for bitcoin? it seems that some sort of automatically adjustning blocksize would be a good idea. Or maybe someone can explain why they are not? thank you
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:44:09
Supply and demand. Usually when the price of something goes up people use less of it. But apparantly this very well established economic phenomenon does not work on Bitcoin. Fees are $10+ and people are sending bitcoin transactions like there is no tomorrow ever since this became the case. It is obviously someone propping up the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-25 02:11:00
The only problem is that someone who trades or owns bitcoin cannot shut up about it lol
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:47:16
The low hanging fruit actually is optimising use for blockspace because how are you going to increase the blocksize without splitting the network? People assume that raising the blocksize is as easy as pressing a button, they dont understand that bitcoin is a decentralized consensus system where changing the rules is rather hard. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:26:06
Are you serious?
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:11:13
Its true. Between dec 7 and dec 8 the mempool rose to 200k unconfirmed transactions where normally it is nearly empty. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:57:56
I think this is just Donald Trump being smart. Maybe he wants the government to cut back and the democrats are probably playing right into his trap. He acts like he doesent want the government to shut down, and then the democrats are like we will not accept this funding bill hah. 
Meanwhile trump is just happy that the government stopped bleeding money.
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:40:49
When people say Bitcoin is a religion its actually the other way around, its the non-bitcoiners who have a religion. Bitcoin is not part of that culture yet so people "attack" people who are into it. Wont change until bitcoin gets more and more ingrained. Just hodl.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:31:17
But they are obviously wrong. Fees are only going to keep rising. The future is second layers and on-chain/off-chain hybrids where stripe could end up playing a big role. Not even gonna discus this with you because you are too dense to understand it which is remarkable considering the current circumstances. You are basically trash and i have put you on ignore. Goodbye.

Does anyone have a link to a transaction from coinbase? i would like to see how it looks. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:48:43
We have, its called Bitcoin :) (But getting in can be tricky)
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:22:00
people are saying it can go to $600k but it might take a few years. By the way the price is just psychological. the supply is very limited. So even if you got 0.1 btc that is still one millionth of the supply. You know what i mean?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:10:08
there is not much the devs can do. its up to the ecosystem to adopt  more effecient means of transacting to reduce fees.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:23:47
what isnt
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:21:47
people holding on hoping for better times but the longer the droop keeps on the closer they get to capitulating. price is still in a downtrend since it hit $17k
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:01:22
it sounds great but good luck geting that stuff activated if/when the code is up:) its gonna be segwit2x version 2. We are gonna have people block it unless it comes with a blocksize increase. its disgusting. its disgusting.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:25:12
Maybe they can make online retail with bitcoin easier too
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:08:02

This is great news but we need more. We need more.
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:31:42
Yes, absolutely. Last i checked it was about 10% using it. So there is plenty of room to go. Adopting SegWit also isnt the only way to reduce fees.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:46:33
thanks for the heads up. i may or may not have left a review.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:33:07
Ok so on december 7th 200,000 people just decided they were gonna get into bitcoin. lol

miners are fomoing with hashrate
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:46:48
this is great stuff keep it up. thank you. and thank you to all the exchanges and wallets who manage to implemt segwit already.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:52:59
Dont talk about SegWit, it might trigger someone.
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:46:12
BCH is an altcoin
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:31:00
Its been more than a month now with fees around $10 or more. Why dont they go down? You would think people transacted less and fees would come down. But as soon as a block is mined there is enough $10+ transactions to fill the next one. Are people really that eager to make bitcoin transactions? It doesent make sense to me.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:29:06
did you see the tweet showing how busy the bcash dev is copying code from bitcoin core? i thought it was kind of funny.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:51:06
I cant wait for this spam attack to be over and fees to go back to normal. But its most likely someone with deep pockets who intend to keep it going for months.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:30:26
nice. well done. heres hoping this tx will be included asap :)

thank you, let me add that to the list 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:27:15
Its because you check the price constantly. Try to give it some time between you check :)

bitcoin is being spam attacked, who knows how long it will last
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:07:16
It would be pretty funny if someone released a brand new coin, but it was just a fork of bitcoin core that still was on the bitcoin network the only thing that was changed was the denomination. People would probably not even know they were still on the bitcoin network. You call it Bitcoin Bits. People would buy it like crazy not even realising its just bitcoin. Probably will be a bit upset about the fees tho.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:35:38
Depends on the fork. As more and more people use segwit it is not in the interest of forkers not to support it because they lose a portion of their potential userbase. Another thing is these forks are most likely just a fad, eventually people will stop caring about them and they wont trade for much so not worth it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:42:27
7 blocks in the last 10 minutes. You are only supposed to get 1. Not that im complaining :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:40:08
To those that dont know, transaction batching can save up to 80% on fees/blockspace. Its crazy. Now if you add SegWit on top you basically get almost twice that. Im not sure what the hold up is.
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:32:03
Volatility is about the only criticism "no-coiners" got left. But volatility is bound to decrease as adoption increase.
I also suspect that there are forces at play delibarely increasing volatility, if not to make bitcoin look bad but to make money trading the swings.
But volatility is going decrease as the market matures and adoption increases. Be interesting what the critics have to say then.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:31:17
We *are* preparing for the future by accepting the fee pressure and optimising use of blockspace *before* increasing blocksize.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:12:40
Not the part that uses smart contracts
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:10:45
The only one that has been around for years is Bitcoin - Guess which one is more likely to be around in another 10 years? Bitcoin
I mean everything is so new right now, but eventually i think people will settle on a single currency just because its more convenient. I honestly think BTC is the best contender because of its decentralized and censorship resistant nature - Its also a very honest digital currency it doesent lie about scalability issues like ETH and Bcash for example does. These coins could disappear in the near future because they became victim of not taking scaling issues serious. Bitcoin will always be the digital gold and thus the foundation of digital money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:40:53
its the altcoin bubble causing this :P if it pops there is going to be alot of cheap graphics cards out there i suppse.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:19:54
So what you mean to say is that Bitcoin Core does not have full segwit support? Besides i dont think coinbase needs gui support in Core in order to use SegWit. Most services have their own wallet backend they just use bitcoin core to broadcast and recieve transactions and its absolutely possible to broadcast segwit tx with core so i dont understand what the hold up. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:16:10
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:00:48
There is also a petition with over 5,000 signatures for adding SegWit. [Link](
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:08:20
The tools are already here to significantly reduce the fees, but for some reason services and exchanges are not in a rush to use them.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:57:42
pineapple fund is literally changing the world thank you
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:29:44
They also seem to be missing the point. Its not about being fast and furious. Its about being safe and sound.
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:45:24
It seems more productive now doesent it? Before it was posted to justify a hardfork. Now it posted to get coinbase to polute less (Or its just posted because someone feels like it, there doesent have to be an ulterior motive). But obviously getting coinbase to fix it rather than hardforking the protocol is preferable.
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:49:02
Its like tcp/ip. the code for that doesent really change, but the way in which programs handle it can change
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:30:22
You have it completely backwards. There cannot be "micropayments" without the infrastructure. And Stripe could BE this infrastructure. 
Your argument is basically the same as saying nobody will make a bitcoin exchange until volume shows up. But you need a bitcoin exchange in order for volume to show up. Its pretty simple i dont understand how you dont get this.
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:45:16
stop this crap right now. im tired of hearing about coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:58:34
It was probably the US government spamming bitcoin. After the shutdown the mempool is clearing fast.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:31:42
i just checked out the lightning network github and i got to say im impressed with the amount of work going on.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:05:33
Yes you can. IIRC you need the latest version and then when you create a new wallet you have the option of choosing a segwit wallet. But keep in mind Electrum uses Bech32 for segwit which isnt supported alot of places yet.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:30:32
This is interesting. Can you imagine how anti climactic this must have been for them? They are probably used to all kinds of red tape and legal stuff and communication with the bank just to complete a transaction and make sure they got the money. But bitcoin just says "Transaction Confirmed" on a simple website. Thats it. They can focus on getting the goods there safely instead of having to worry about their fucking bank and politics and shit like that. Sorry, that was a rant. Im sorry.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:22:57
thats a reason it probably shouldnt be done in one go :) but honestly this is way out of my field of expertise so im gonna zip it.

This reminds me of the people who said SegWit would never activate because it required 95% miner signalling. But here we are, SegWit still activated :) Its just a matter of time until coinbase decides to do the right thing
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:56:04
This is really what matters. There was also a 3000 ton grain shipment settled in BTC the other day.
This kind of adoption news is boring, but its really what matters.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:25:28
This is the most dangerous chart in crypto. In fact im reluctant to go long on BTC because of this. 
There was never such charts on previous dips. Godspeed.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:57:08
fun fact: Monero implemented Greg Maxwell tech (CT) before Bitcoin did :) Maybe they will do the same for Taproot. :)
*edit* The reason they can do this is because they are still relatively small market cap, they can get away with being more experimental - there also is not alot of infrastructure surrounding the coin yet so they can "move fast" without actually breaking much etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:24:56
And mempool is down. I wonder who was spamming and causing high fees?
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:04:31

that is a myth like many others spread by trolls.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:59:01
The current fee pressure is from someone attacking Bitcoin. Its like a medieval siege. He is trying to starve everyone inside the ecosystem. But who is going to win? Will this attacker run out of money to prop up fees or will people eventually capitulate and dump their BTC? Who will win? The siege has already lasted 30 days costing about $5M per day. I hope its worth it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:07:57

@_date: 2018-01-04 07:27:37
That probably is small as fuck if you ask me. People who wanted to sell their bitcoin have been selling for the last month or so. Doubt there are many sellers left. But lets see.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:09:52
Imo that was a halfassed approach. They practically declared they had consensus before they had it. That is doomed to fail because people get upset and stubborn then. Anyway, fees are coming down which is interesting considering the backlog was absolutely huge. So maybe its not time to raise Blocksize yet.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:38:22
Because its more effecient
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:06:42
This is excactly what they want. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:01:15
It is beyond me why they dont try to become the payment winner themselves. They could develop their own transaction system that used bitcoin to settle with. I dont think they are making a wise move here by just going back to lurking. Its time to experiment!
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:50:57
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:54:27
you need services and exchanges to adopt segwit and use less blockspace by batching transactions. you get much lower fees that way without compromising the blocksize limit. everyone gets what they want.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:30:36
Ok what do you suggest?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:22:17
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:44:28
That actually looks good. Also i love how that healthwise thing advertises cleanlyness but the trailer and car is dirty as fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:59:23
ln just seems too good to be true
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:50:14
Transaction batching is the most obvious, but this applies mostly to exchanges etc. So instead of making hundreds of individual transactions you batch them every 10 minutes or 1h or whatever fits your prerogative. It consumes less blockspace that way.
As an individual you can try to keep your coins in a single adress. This means when you send them you require less blockspace as well.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:05:43
being an early adopter they are probably sitting on piles of cash like every other early adopter and can do whatever the fack they want. When the going gets tough i suspect they will wise up. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:54:45
Thats the "beauty" of decentralization. Everyone can pretend they are in charge, and everyone can pretend they are the expert. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:44:07
That is the most absurd statement i have ever heard lol. The worst part is that those few who didnt want segwit cannot explain why. They were just being like little crybabies as far as i can see. On top of that SegWit is backward compatible so even if they dont like it they can just not use it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:00:50

Just because you pay to spam does not make you any less of a spammer.
I suppose you think im not polluting if i buy a gallon of gas and pour it down the drain. Because i paid for the gas so im not actually polluting.
Or if i pay someone to send a thousand emails to someone i am not spamming. Because i paid for it.
Or if i run the hot water 24/7 in my apartment, from all showers and faucets, im not consuming all the hot water, because im actually paying for it.

Why is coinbase so slow to implement SegWit and transaction batching? It could save their users alot on fees.
@_date: 2018-01-15 10:09:52

Do they call it MuSig? Seems like it can create some confusion
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:43:28
It does. 50% imediately and as adoption increases the fee pressure itself will also go down

@_date: 2018-01-09 17:27:57
cant tell if serious
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:13:13

Looking at the transactions in some of the recent blocks and its disgusting to see the waste that is going on.
For example this guy:
He made 13 transactions and just paid a flat 0.002 BTC fee for each one ($23 each, $299 total)
He could have made just ONE transaction paying out to the 13 different adresses and saved 80% on fees.

This whole clusterfuck could have been avoided if like Bitstamp Coinbase would have announced their intention in advance. Bitstamp made it public several weeks before, this way they didnt have to worry about insider trading or market disruption.
I wouldnt put it past Brian Armstrong that this is just a case of sheer incomeptence but IF you wanted to make maximum bang for your buck on insider trading you do not tell anyone about your listing until the very last minute so it could also be intentional.

Apparantly some people didnt get the memo that cryptocurrency doesent scale so i guess they are having a bit of a crisis seeing these fees. Rest assured that the solutions to fix this in the short term is already here and a longer term solution is in the works. So yea do what you want.

Thats an interesting point of view. However id say Bitcoin is working as intended, anything extra is just a bonus, thats if you want to look at it from a Store of value pespective - I mean you only really need to make sure the 21 million coin limit is intact for that to be the case. But if you look at Bitcoin as a transaction system you are probably gonna be disappointed because it cant do that many TPS. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:19:48

If you could not keep coins safely in LN the whole point is defeated to begin with, but that is obviously not the case. Alot of people will prefer LN node over deep cold storage - The coins arent doing anything anyway so you might as well allegate them to LN for that passive income.

A pull request is basically a patch that changes the software in question. Anyone can make pull requests. It is up to the maintainer of the project wether it should be included or not. Obviously he convenes with other contributors so as to avoid merging bad code.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:05:13
That is not 100% correct. Ancaps believe in the non-aggression principle. They still have morals - roger ver apparantly dont. If you as an exchange keep information like listing a new coin secret in order to profit from it, then you are immoral imo. Exchanges also have a responsibilty to do what they can to avoid market destabilisation and coinbase failed here as well. 
If they had announced their intention in advance like other exchanges do then there would be no insider trading concern, the markets wouldnt have popped a bloodvessel, and coinbase servers might not have crashed.
Meanwhile roger ver is like, i dont think insider trading is wrong. he misses the point as always.

Its a decentralized network, you cant just shut down the nodes/miners or confiscate peoples coins.

Core already supports SegWit. Im not sure what kind of functionality is missing? Are you talking about the GUI? Exchanges do not use the Core GUI to handle their wallet infrastructure. Core software is "just" used as the link between Bitcoin and the service in question. All the wallet stuff is custom afaik. This actually is self evident once you understand that some services and exchanges already support SegWit. Electrum, Bitstamp, Trezor etc.

I think its a pretty safe bet that on-chain transactions wont have any ground breaking improvements. On-chain transactions probably wont change much at all. But of course some really innovative thing could be invented and forked into the protocol. But i wouldnt count on it. Off-chain is where its at for mainstream. But lets see.

I think even CME is pissed off. CME is using Coinbase as part of their index but Coinbase was extremely unproffesional with the launch of BCH which caused market disruption even in BTC and their own exchange even failed because of too much load, nobody was prepared. How on earth did they expect things to go?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:13:58
I dont buy that argument. The rise in fees is too spontanteus and too sustained. I mean fees dont organically go from $2 to $15 and then to $40 in two weeks because the moment they went to $15 demand would already be shrinking (For example people would use litecoin to transfer between exchanges or they would just not do a transaction) which would reduce demand. But instead demand just kept going up in an aggressive fashion as if someone was spamming.

People expressing their dissatisfaction with Coinbase is a form of regulation in itself. You are not automatically a statist just because you think someone else did something wrong. And no, listing bcash in itself was not wrong, it was keeping it secret until the very last minute that was. Why? Because the market went completely bonkers,  its unproffesional. You announce it weeks in advance to prevent market and service disruption. Also by keeping it secret the insiders gain an edge, but there is no point in keeping it secret UNLESS you want to give insiders an edge. Shame on coinbase.

We are all kinda trapped. Dont really want to be in BTC but also dont really want to be out of BTC. I dont think the fees are normal, i think its malicious, its an attempt to make Bitcoin Cash look better. But its really expensive cause these high fees. So its just a matter of time until the fees come down. It could be weeks, months tho. But they will come down sooner or later.
Another thing is that even if the spammer keeps up, exchanges, wallets and so on can still improve their wallets and adopt segwit and so on and really reduce fees, so its not like we are completely screwed.

This is why it will do the opposite now and actually fall.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:09:20
Because ETH changes its state every block. Each block is like a single computer cycle. So you cant really gain proiority on some transactions, there is a specific order they have to be spent in. I guess the benefit is its slightly more scalable but when blocks become full which is inevitable you get a myriad of problems so its actually worse off because of that.
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:56

Its a network of payment channels. If i want to pay bob but i dont have a direct link with him i can go through alice which does and whom i have a link to. Its all automatic. No central authority.

there has to be a better place to ask this question. This is a bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:46:37
This is partially true. But the protocol only permits so much data per block. So when wallets and services use up more data than neccesary this results in higher fees than neccesary due to supply and demand. So if wallets and services actually optimise the way they interact with the protocol they could save on fees.

If Bitcoin is gonna get worldwide adoption you are still a early adopter at this point. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:10:11
Because most users are likely to just have 1 channel open, and those that have multiple channels open are in competition with others who have channels open to the same places you do. So even if you have multiple channels you are not guaranteed payments go through yours afaik.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:10:55
Yea. They lucky it wasnt attacked. I wonder if anyone would do it now if its hashrate was to ever get that low again.

bcash hashpower is not that low, the amount it has now is quite safe. But it also trades at a ratio of 0.20 BTC which is redicolous if you ask me. If/when then this ratio drops so should the hashpower.

i see your point but chances are most people wont have payments routed through them. But lets see.
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:15:34
end users probably wont be using lightning. its going to be the backend of all the bitcoin buisnesses and so on. end users will just be using a web application and all the magic happens in the back.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:59:17
Yes thats what i was getting at. However in this day and age it wouldnt surprise me if an altcoin overtook BTC in market cap tbh. They seem to pump like crazy. It doeent actually replace bitcoin tho. Possibly if Bitcoin was to lose the  spot it could cause a dip that would be worth buying :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:43:48
Dump BTC to the ground. The only reason altcoins have any confidence is because they look at BTC and see its $16k. If we dump BTC to $4k all the altcoins would die. Sounds like a good idea to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:44:24
Excactly what would have that solved? Oh $10 fees instead of $20? Big whoop
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:56:32

Read some of the first discussions about Bitcoin ever, it was already understood then that the system couldnt handle any significant amount of transactions and that second layers etc. was neccesary. So i dont know what you have been smoking.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:28:09


This is shocking tbh. But its nice to know that the solutions to this redicolous fee pressure is already here and its just a matter of time until people start utilising them.

Steam is basically saying on-chain payments are not attractive to them. Good thing Bitcoin is focusing on off-chain solutions despite all the haters saying what a terrible direction that is to go.
So this news is actually worse for Bitcoin Cash because because they are betting that on-chain payments are the future but Steam is clearly saying that on-chain transactions is not working for them. And its not just because of the fees - Bitcoin cash will have fees as well if adoption picks up, just like Bitcoin does and just like Ethereum does.
But steam says its because on-chain payments are too clunky and there is too much room for error and i agree with them. Hopefully LN or Square will solve this! Or Bitpay but they are literally asleep at the wheel. They should have seen this coming but failed to adapt now they lost a huge customer.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:15:40
Its still acurate, the fees on BTC right now is not normal. Whenever the spammer runs out of money they will return to normal. But who knows when that will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:56:54
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:31:06
btc currently has about a million active adresses every day. and its only running at half capacity.  so in theory a million channels or more could open every day. Anyway thats given current scalability. it might improve in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:14:17
Only the smart rich will have bitcoin. The lousy rich - Which are the ones we hate - are too arrogant/dumb to buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:44
how do you know? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:32:32
Just listen to yourself. "Currency with low fees and fast"
That statement fundamentally doesent make sense.
Do you look at the USD in terms of being fast and low fee? Of course you dont.  That is not a defining characteristic of a currency. You are talking about a payment system. Am i right? Bitcoin is not a payment system, its digital scarcity. The payment systems will be built on top - They have to, otherwise its just going to be a niche.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:18:01
how is bitcoin cash not a conspiracy? did you see what happened today?
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:53:23
There is an even less known upgrade available called bech32. Should probably spread awareness about that too :) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:01:17
For who?
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:24:22


This is not a big risk. The chances of that happening is really, really low, and at best it would be temporary. Maybe if the market truly favors BCH and in a few years maybe everything will be migrated but in the short term BCH is not something that is gonna be able to take and maintain BTC hashrate. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:18:29
Your confusion is understood. Fact of the matter is that using SegWit will reduce the amount of fees you pay and make slightly more room for everyone else. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:48:28
The good thing here is that nobody really controls Bitcoin, so even if a nation is not in control, Bitcoin still cannot be used to control a nation. Its just money. The most neutral of its kind.

Im even in disbelief and i bought the dip. Why does this keep working?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:24:51
Another blocksize increase still isnt safe. And although these fees are annoying they are not the end of the world. And another blocksize increase is going to slash fees for how long? 6 months then its time again? And if you do a blocksize increase every time nobody will actually be scaling, theyd just keep using on-chain transactions like madness, right?
tl;dr blocksize increase is not an answer
last but not least this extreme fee pressure out of nowhere is not natural. eventually fees will return to  normal again. so just relax.
btw. there is tech available that cuts fees in half but exchanges like coinbase and bitfinex hasnt implemented it yet and its been ready for ages. What are they waiting for?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:35:33
Thats a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:17:29
A big piece of the puzzle is the fee pressure. The only problem is people go and create alternative cryptocurrencies with the same scaling issues instead of actually trying to solve/improve scale
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:02:58
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:44:51
I used the $5million estimate which is currently less than half of the fees paid per day. So that leaves room for miners if its a miner doing the spam, recouping a portion of the money and so on.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:56:16
please go easy on people. i know it can be hard. but its better that way.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:56:59
In a way SegWit could help them. It weighs less, frees up space so fees may come down and they can consolidate their UTXO.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:55:14

Huge problem? Why?


@_date: 2017-12-29 18:10:45
Just ignore them
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:18:18
Its going to get alot better once coinbase and so on get their stuff sorted out. People dont understand that bitcoin practically has twice if not more the capacity than what is currently being used. Its more than enough for the next year or so. Maybe even more as second layer services comes online and people have to rely on on-chain transactions less.
The problem is that there is currently a small incentive to pump fees in order to make the "ignorant masses" scared and dump their coins and buy altcoins. But this thing gets less and less effective as people learn. So eventually fees are just going to return to normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:44:43
dude. you could be making the same  mistake again. buying btc at the top and selling bch at the bottom. you are in a tough spot thats for sure.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:45:23
please dont talk about the blocksize debate ever. You spread misinformation.
Being against a blocksize increase today does not mean you will be in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:18:32
This is true. But off-chain scaling is going to explode and you are probably going to see people use on-chain transactions less. But over time on-fees ought to slowly get more and more expensive but we are talking a really slow progress. What we are experiencing now is a malicious attempt to drive them up. An expensive endevaour too. So whats going to happen is that sooner or later fees will settle around $0.50 again and then slowly go up from there. :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:19:22
Well you can have bitcoin be transported in many different ways just like you can with USD. I can give you a hardware wallet with BTC on it. I can give you a paper wallet. I can give you a private key. I can send you bitcoin via on-chain. Or i can... I mean theres a myriad of ways to send and recieve bitcoin.

The only occasions Bitcoin fees have been stupidly high was 
1. When NYA was announced 
2. When BCASH launched
3. When NYA failed
All 3 times fees rose to insane levels, most likely because of a malicious actor pushing a specific agenda. 
Normally Bitcoin fees are low, like $1 or less.

Uh but you have a decrease in buying power if the currency inflates. UNLESS adoption outpace it.

there will always be people who are allergic to bitcoin (because they are upset for not getting in early or for being wrong) but they will still want exposure to crypto so they will pick anything not bitcoin.

the thing is when btc starts going down it creates an avalanche. So price will go down as far as it has to until people stop selling. No amount of liquidity can stop the bitcoin avalanche when it gets going. However it works in the other direction too.

It is kind of better not to do the audit because it makes people more cautious. So if for example Tether gets auditied people might get over confident in it because the money can still be seized by authorities so the audit actually only gives a false sense of security and makes a possible implosion even worse because people were lead to be believe Tether was safe to hold. Also keep in mind that people are not obligated to use Tether, so if they dont like or trust it they can just not use it, so whats all the fuss about? If you are concerned for Bitcoins well being in the event of a Tether implosion well any dip in price will just be very temporary, so there is no real reason to worry so much about it.
TL;DR people who complain about tether are irrational
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:30:15

These swings are not that great :) We need adoption. Its not all about price. So what kind of adoption might we see in 2018? Those CME and CBoE futures was a pretty big deal. And yes they probably ensured some kind of price on floor on bitcoin. Maybe its $4k, $5k? But that doesent mean its gonna go straight back to $25k. I dont think. There needs to be more adoption for that i think. But lets see.

Nobody who use Tether care about that audit. It is just a bunch of idiots who make alot of fuss about it.
And if Tether was to complete an audit, get someone to say Yep all the money is there. The idiots will just say they want another opinion still. They will never be satisfied.
The important thing is that Tether maintains its tether to the USD and so far it does so what is the problem? An audit and 100% reserve doesent change the fact that tether operates a grey area and may be shut down over night. It simply amazes me how obsessed people have become with an audit that isnt going to change a thing.
Other than that your analogy is terrible. A better analogy would be to scan for cancer in say the left leg and if no cancer was found determine the patient had no cancer what so ever anywhere on the body. Obviously thats not how things work.

Consensus.. Whats next? What happens when fees go up again? What happens when the blockchain becomes 500gb? Things like that.. What if a new coin springs up and it ends up being superior and more valuable?
I know these arent doomsday scenarios, and as an investor you will have time to deal with it as these "problems" arise.. You can make a decision then, and just hodl until then.. Your coins will likely be safe. Better than fiat.

ur only being played for fools if you try to trade those swings without knowing what you are doing. Truth is that throwing the price all over the place is one of the few attack vectors BTC has. But it doesent affect the underlying protocol and the price manipulators are not all powerful so overall the trend is up and hodlers will be fine. The larger the market gets and the more liquid, the more mature and more difficult it will be to throw the price around so no problem.

@_date: 2018-04-14 08:04:42
Yes and no. With bitcoin the money supply becomes sound, so you dont get this feedback loop where the rich keep getting richer and the poor gets poorer.
Bitcoin will even the playing field because it will also reeuce the power of the state, where despite what everyone tells you, the state mostly benefit the rich.
So bitcoin will even the playing field, and although some early adopters will probably be disproportionately wealthy, there will only be very few of them, and lets face it, they wont have any skills. all they have is a pile of money. They will either waste it or take it to their grave.
What imtrying to say is that those that generate the wealth. the ones who invent and improve and provide a service to others, will eventually bexome the rich ones, unlke today where this phenomenon exist to a lesser extent. Have a nice day.

Hey but at least the banks are cool with bitcoin and they are not allowed to shut down your account
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:07:44
I tend to say that the bitcoin bubble has popped. Its now an actual asset. Get it?
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:12:43
Bitcoin was at the right place at the right time. And so was i, i guess.

only time ive used an APK was when the app was not available from the google store in my region. Obviously they can be less safe and you must be sure you are not getting malware.

We need actual adoption, not these wall street figures.
For example, when can i top off my paypal account with bitcoin (i dont care if its converted to dollars)? Thats adoption :)

Does lightning work or not?

What a scary executive order. Please note what followed was the second world war. Hurray for fiat money and printing presses! Now we can fuel war by printing "money" out of thin air!
By the way if you decided to keep your gold how would you sell it a few laters if you needed cash? Would they not wonder where you got it from?

LN amazes me. WIth traditional wallets what was the incentive for developing them? They were all free. 
But with LN there is actually an incentive to develop the wallet since most users are likely to chose your node, which means payments route through you which means you get a very small amount of sats for each transaction. The more users you got the better of you are. Sorry just wanted to get that off my chest.

Bigger blocks is not even needed yet

Why do you post that here? Who cares?
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:02:42
Theres no easy way to do it :) And if you really wanna do it you gotta be sure its the right thing to do. 
Since you could relatively easy do segwit and lightning, why not try that first.

Please look up on what addiction is. It is a result from failed families, a bad upbringing. And opioids arent the only things you can get addicted to. Sex, games, gambling you name it. 
People like this who blame bitcoin arent actually interesting in solvomg addiction.  That is all.

Native bitcoin support in paypal would be awesome. Not sure what the hold up is. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:33:39
 my friend. But it may be hard to find someone willing to accept paypal. But you never know.

Theres already alot of people trading it. What we need is adoption. Altho its a trading exchange i really like bitmex because they use bitcoin as collataral and its a huge success. No fiat needed. This is the kind of adoption i wanna see where BTC is actually used. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2018-04-07 14:17:39
who cares about price predictions. adoption is where its at. whos going to adopt bitcoin next?
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:07:53
Ye gold takes alot more energy to transact, at least under current market conditions.
Are you gonna send it via mail? Are you gonna walk down to the store and sell it? Seems like alot of work. And if you wanna sell $25k worth, you better be packing or have some sort of security. Gold aint safe, but its safe. You know what i mean?
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:23:40
Ye. Hardware wallets make it kinda easy. It is way better than an exchange if you do not intend to trade which i wouldnt advise anyway..

Its better than fiat tho, and fiat is better than gold in some regards. So Gold &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Fiat sort of

If its a store of value the day to day swings dont matter. You are probably planning to hold for years, so day to day swings dont matter.

The more bitcoiners etc. push back against BCH the bigger the incentive gets for all the bad actors in the world to pump it

Did you mean 100 satoshis = 1 Bitcoin?
I wonder how much 100 satoshis is in terms of USD
Turns out 100 satoshi is ~1 cent atm.
