Second factor authentication. It's under the security settings on coinbase's website (I think you need to use a PC to enable it, not the app).
You need to use an authenticator app like Google authenticator. It links to your coinbase account and generates random 6 digit codes every few seconds. You need to access the app to see the code and enter it to log into your account. No one can get into your account without physically holding your phone to get the newest codes.
You save the backup code on paper somewhere safe in case your phone bricks or something to access your account.

If by cute you mean violently dogmatic about their favorite monopoly, sure.

You should not use the text/call option, but rather an authenticator app. It's more secure.

Public schools don't want you to think about this. It puts your government overlords in a bad light.

The solution will of course be to print more money and further devalue the dollar.

There is an additional layer present in BTC that isn't in a lot of the bubbles of the past. Scarcity. I think this will be a huge boon for the market.

By default it's set to sms, no backup code for that and your phone number can be comprised by a solid phishing attempt. 
You want to change it to an authenticator app. When you set it to that, it gives you a QR code to scan with your phone to link the app and a backup code. Print that QR code/character code or write them down exactly and store them somewhere safe/private.
 this is why you want an authenticator.

I love this. This market empowers well intentioned people to ferret out criminals.
