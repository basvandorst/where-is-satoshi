Fact 1: Unless you obtained ALL your bitcoin/CC directly by mining, without having purchased any, you did, at some point, engage a third party.
Fact 2:  Until such time that the market penetration of bitcoin reaches the point that a high enough percentage of the GDP is transacted in bitcoin, chances are that not many businesses will be willing to accept it, WITHOUT a 3rd party to mitigate the risk from trade volatility.
Fact 3:  AML/KYC is NOT going to go away, neither will centralized governments, or their regulatory or enforcement agencies.
Idealism is a wonderful thing, but please temper it a bit with the cold hard truth of human nature.  Just like pb1x pointed out earlier, Coinbase is bridging the gap, and there is one last point I'd like to make...  Each transaction still has to go to the blockchain, and this gives Coinbase a wonderful place to gather general usage metrics to make press releases about, especially with the amount of  people who would use the shift card to pay their bills, buy pizza, etc.

"A mechanism that forces transactions to carry an attractive fee is good for the network as creates a fee market to the benefit of the miners, which will increase network security. It is important that bitcoin have this fee market as eventually fees will be all that there is to incentivize miners to secure the network (and therefore it is good to cultivate the market early)."
--No, it is not.  Increasing fees right now REDUCES adoption by pricing out the very market you want to attract.  Mining will ALWAYS be competitive.  It might SEEM like it increases security, but in reality, increased fees=reduced transaction count, which reduces the demand for mining, because people will use the network less, or for who who would have been new, not even try it at all.  We miners have enough incentive.  Don't buy into the 'I need to ROI before everyone else' hype.
Bitcoin and bitcoin are not only PRODUCTS, but a DYNAMIC economy.  ALL economies are DYNAMIC in nature, because they are driven by PEOPLE.
In my opinion, the most effective short term and long term solution, (which does introduce risks, there's no such thing as a perfect system), would be a Dynamic blocksize, (if softcap 2MB within prior 20 minutes, blocksizelimit 2GB), accompanied with a fee ROLLBACK, and ELIMINATE the ability for miners to choose their blocks based on size.  We can Meta the blocks for voting purposes, can't we?

Buying really is the easiest way.  Everyone's mentioned alot of the best routes to go for that.  I wouldn't get into mining unless you're willing to either commit to equipment, and worrying about ROI (return on investment), or if you look at cloud mining, do a THOROUGH research job on every place you consider BEFORE sending a single satoshi into it.  There are known scammers like Terabox.

The Shift Card.    Granted, it's a third party mechanism, and nowhere near as nice as if they accepted the bitcoin themselves, but it will still work.
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:43:44
hmmm... while that would carry the risk of spam data, long term that sounds the most reasonable so far.  Take the VarDiff concept and just apply it to blocksize?  I can't think of flaws beyond Fee adjustment and the possiblity of data spam, which someone could try, if they were willing to spend the money on fees, (talk about wasting money).  The reason this sounds the most reasonable is because human behavior isn't mutiplicative, linear, or scalar, but variable, and that will ALWAYS be the primary market driver behind transaction volume.

There is no such thing as a system that can't be manipulated though.

you'll only have to pay taxes on your profit, and by the numbers you gave you're looking at roughly $32k in profit.  Even at the self-employment tax rate, are you really going to gripe at have made $25k profit after taxes?  If so, please get out of my gene pool.

Do not trust.  Mine, AND verify.

The reply for your statement is in the statement itself.  If you're STORING value, why would you spend it?  Don't misunderstand, I'm sure some agree with you, and believe it or nor, I do.  But I mine, and cloudmine, and once I've reached a sufficient compounding threshold, I'll be spending it also, most likely through a shiftcard, or whoever comes up with one that has a better implementation for retail spending/withdrawals.
@_date: 2015-12-06 20:48:02
Nah, I live in the US, honestly, it EASIER to buy at a BTM for me than coinbase.  (1) walk up &amp; scan wallet QR, (2) deposit cash, (3) confirm.  But there's anywhere from 5-10% markup.

For that little investment money, go cloudmining.  The two companies I feel are legit are hashnest and genesis.  Your requirements pretty much eliminate everything that won't take a decade to RoI... unless you're willing to buy up all those usb sticks floating around ebay at $10/gh.

This from the man in charge of making Kaspersky adware?  On subject, he's apparently operating on the assumption that National Currencies aren't inherently unsettled already.  The current fiat system is unnatural in that it can potentially create infinite amounts of currency.  Other than observations of space, science has not identified a single infinite system, and even that is still in question.  Cryptocurrencies make FAR more sense from a physics standpoint.

Well, first, the basic advice:
~DO NOT INVEST MORE THAN YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.
~The moment you buy bitcoin, keep track of the amount in, this is cost basis.
~The moment you buy bitcoin, treat it as if you've just walked into a casino with cash.
~Know your exit before you even walk in the door.
That said, LEARN from the mistakes of others, -
"Some learn from the mistakes of others, some learn from their own mistakes, and some never learn" -unknown (as in, I don't know who said it)
Lurk this board FIRST! -- 
That's the initial start.  Beyond that, the two sites where I have cloudmining going are Genesis Mining, and Hashnest.
I also have ASICs pointed into pools, (the pool varies), and I use a compounding strategy when it comes to hashrate.
Embrace Mathematics.  Learn to isolate which numbers are going to mean the most to you.  Once you've gotten your formulas, stick to them.
If you're looking to INVEST in bitcoin, be ready to watch the price fall and shrug it off.  Also, read every bit of advice you can from people like Warren Buffet.
There is one last fact that for many(I hope), is a given and that is this.
ALL PROFIT AND LOSS HINGES ON THE EXCHANGE RATE.

That's because they usually don't HAVE to, have you ever read your account statements and how DETAILED they are regarding how you use money?
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:38:43
I'm not so sure that linear is the safe bet, though.  One point I would like to bring up is the halving schedule.  It's not linear.  Network difficulty increases?  Again, not linear.  Trade volume history?  Very much variable, (yes, that's a given).  My point is there are very few critical factors in Bitcoin that are linear when you look at them.  I think a linear solution to a variable problem is a recipe for ECE, when the primary contributing factors involved will be trade value, and retail adoption.  The trade volume in China due to people hedging off the Yuan pumped up the trade price.  Please note, there still has yet to be any truly widespread adoption in the majority of developing nations.  I think any solution needs to at least account for a very much variable transaction volume.

While we in the US owe a LOT to the French historically, it gets difficult to respect their intellect with cryptocurrency getting blamed for law enforcement not acting on data they already had.
@_date: 2015-12-19 09:44:20
Hmmmm... realistically, I can see how a release of fee pressure is going to be inevitable.  The real question is when to account for and implement it?  Now while the fees still account for less than 1.5% of mining revenue, or later when that percentage is higher?  We both have valid points, I'm just not sure how much impact a release of fee pressure would have now compared to 1 or 2 halvings down the line.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:20:27
No.  I wouldn't have been interested enough to do more than ignore headlines like I had been.
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:20:36
scalar basically means that increase or decrease is based on the previous number.  Scalar graphs usually have what becomes a "snowball effect" curve.  Blockreward halving is a negative scalar with a termination point, so it's still fixed.  Like many have said, the vast majority of us agree we need a blocksize increase, the issue is how much, and HOW.  I'm not a programmer, but researching is one of my strong points, due to being able to step back and reference one factor off of another.
@_date: 2015-12-19 09:22:33
True... for both of us.

So in other words, looking at that, the nobel currently being considered for Nakamoto should probably go to Nash, putting him up for his SECOND in Economics.
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:11:44
Not really, I'm a miner, and if you would want the IMF to list bitcoin as a reserve currency, (thus increasing your mining revenue from market response), then ANY failure of blocksolve with all transactions within 10 minutes will detract from that possiblility, after all, this will be for many people what pays the bills, from the mining as well as consumer perspective.
@_date: 2015-12-20 09:05:36
Hmmm... very true.  That's very much a factor to take into consideration, but if this is going to scale to the point it can rival any of the major payment networks in volume, it will need to be able to handle far more transactions per block than even a 2MB increase would allow, otherwise it will end up a case of, "I couldn't pay enough fee to get it done same day".  Don't get me wrong, centralization attacks are one of the critical concerns, Especially with some of the mining "pools" being private companies, (I won't bash anyone in this forum), but there ARE many private company pools out there, (I've even done some market research in my area for my own business plan on one).  Realistically thinking, If the blocksize limit ISN'T raised, the worry of attack might be futile, because the network may not be reliable enough for consumers to even CONSIDER testing it, let alone switching to it.  I think the real dialogue is HOW to raise it, and by how much.  I'm in favor of anything that allows for a variable 'anomaly' block.  Example, The recent Coinbase trade volume spike.  How many people saw that coming?  Security against attacks IS concern, I agree with you on that.  So is OVERALL security by keeping the network WORKING.  Without a blocksize solution that accounts for sudden, unpredictable transaction volume, Bitcoin will lag.  Don't get me wrong, if the lag puts people in the position that they wait a whole HOUR for the first confirmation, it still BY FAR more dynamic, responsive, and reliable that any of the ACH transfers.  After all, don't we all love that we can transfer funds from wallet to wallet in minutes rather than days?  At the same time though, Never underestimate the power of Bad News to the average consumer.  Remember, there are STILL people in Japan who think that the Bitcoin 'Company' went bankrupt, (ignorance in media coverage of Mt. Gox).

they can be, scalars can be additive though, like (f)n = n + (2n+1) -- (f=function)

You realize your saying that about the company that's made one of the first real leaps into spending bitcoin at walmart, amazon, etc, WITHOUT those companies needing to adopt it, right?  Most people I've sent the Coinbase referral links to haven't responded due to either physical/intellectual laziness.
@_date: 2015-12-19 02:07:45
Thank you, I should have read your post before making mine about the scalar and variable relationships and factors.
@_date: 2015-12-19 01:12:40
I would agree, but while the technical details between them are different, is the current rate of network difficulty increase linear?  To me it looks very scalar.  The biggest problem here is that we're trying to anticipate dynamic human behavior, ultimately.  As a miner, (and someone LONG on bitcoin and Bitcoin), I would much rather the network have stability in making sure there are no "unconfirmed" waits beyond ten minutes, otherwise one of the innovative properties of Bitcoin gets completely neutered.

It's kind of amazing how few people mention hashrate investments.  First, all things have risk, and ALL profit/loss in bitcoin is tied to the exchange rate.  So far I've only run across 3 ways to invest in hashrate, (Cloudmining).  One is Genesis Mining, one is Hashnest, the other is BW.com.  BW I just came across last week, and am in my pre-order phase with, I don't have numbers on them yet to work with.  The other two yield anywhere from 0.1-0.2% daily return, however, at Genesis mining, you cannot withdraw funds.  Once hashrate is bought there, it's permanent, and gives daily payouts.  You'd probably see your initial investment back in about a year.  At hashnest, you CAN pull out your funds, but you're doing stock market style hashrate buys, (don't buy the S7 miners to run in the center, they're overpriced compared to buying one to run at home).  Since you'd be doing your hashrate buys there, remember that you either want to buy low/sell high, or WAIT for ROI.  You do get your numbers so you can do that calc pretty easily.  Again tho, it takes about 6-10 months to reach ROI.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:51:13
Yeah, failed experiments usually don't attract hundreds of millions in VC.  Another point is that the exchange rate did manage to climb to over $400/coin WITHOUT Satoshi Nakamoto on board.
