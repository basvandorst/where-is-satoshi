The good thing with Bitcoin and other crypto (decentralized) is that technically one can never be late to buy it, as money represents purchasing power. Those who buy it today paves the road (with higher risks) for a deflationary pricing environment for the future users as we're moving power away from structure systems as central banks and governments. Will it last, yes, but no one can predict where people actually will be holding/trusting their money towards as even banks will start their own crypto currencies in the future to try to compete with the decentralized crypto currencies that already shocked the(ir) way of life.

Would it be possible for one of them to recreate your seed with only 12 words, since the word database is known for most seeds. I haven't done the math,  just wondering how much computer power/time that would take as someone in family can go rogue.

But do remember it's only at 140 billion dollars market cap at almost 10K per coin.
If more institutions and investors were heavily in early, price would have been much higher and far riskier for a huge fallback with whales selling at any hint of downsides. 
Now we've grown more mature and healthy,  therefore a little better protected from near extinction sell offs. The more people who actually use Bitcoin for trade,  will stabilize future sell offs. Just my 2 satoshis on the matter.

This is beautiful and inspiring, far more than a TED talk. Thank you sir or miss for this great long move.

I can say that my mutual funds currently has a 4% gain, crypto assets -12% and FIAT is mostly placed in a 2% interests account.
I am very early in investments as I am in many ways restarting the whole thing as I needed to deplete much of my savings/investments the last 4 years (entrepreneurship took its toll, but I've turned the boat around). 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:43:52
Cost me 2.4 USD to make a SEPA transaction + the built in exchange profit.
6.2 USD for international IBAN transfer + exchange profit.
SEPA takes 1-3 days (only weekdays counted and all red/holidays are more waiting days). 
IBAN takes 3-5 days (only weekdays and same waiting on red days). 
LN beats that with millisecond, who wins long term? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:09:25
I've handpicked the funds, though yes there is a normal 1-2% fee, but looking at their 10-15 year history performance and purpose paper (ethics,  field,  etc) it's easier than making pure stock buys from my point of view (fees are high buying individual stocks as well, but there is the payout benefit + stock appreciation that is interesting). I am still relative young and have an aggressive portfolio in stocks (sorry,  mutual funds) with a 15-20% estimation based on historic data (probably will land around 10% long term, which is good as long as I don't need the money in a financial crisis or something).
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:39:37
Thank you for the inputs,  I will definitely consider ETH when moving more funds into crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:36:08
Good question, but it has to do with me restarting investments due to depletion of investments (had gold, some stocks and house savings on a 5% interest account) since I went off-the-grid with work 4 years ago (entrepreneurship)... Now I am doing well and want to be prepared for the future.

I use earn.com for the paid email with btc received, but it would be lovely to see more businesses in the game with more intuitive solutions such as LN + email + app that can tie it all together... 
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:26:03
I was thinking it as a small hedge versus the BTC investment, but I will sell if the loss is going over 50% (loosing 1%) long term.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:02:36
True, but even the scam coin Bitconnect is still worth something (crazy as that sounds). However, competition between coins is good and price fluctuations and total abandonment from one coin to another will happen in the coming future many times over. Crypto will stay though. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:44:35
Would be better if a complete removal of licensing and regulations to create your own bank with a click of a button, with whatever backing you'd like (crypto,  gold,  trading,  etc) . The most transparent and honest banks will win the market, just like a normal crypto currency. Deflationary money will go back in style as it once was in the 1800 in USA. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:52:25
Yes, true. I am working on moving more into earning products as stocks and crypto. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:38:16
It's officially 2,5% or 2% (not sure which one is the target now). It's a European country with good economics, so a relatively stable FIAT currency.

How much percentage do you have in debt versus your all-in to Bitcoin?

Thank you for the input, the hedge was more if BCH went up in the battle of adoption (short term hedge idea with a sell-off when tables turned with BTC/LN adoption taking place). Though I think LN has potential and look forward to see what's happening this summer with its adoption.
Token investment is interesting, I do look into it and has owned ETH earlier, but not sure if they  an pull it off (but smart script/contract tokens will definitely take over, but who will lead the way)... 
@_date: 2018-06-06 07:30:48
Hehe, yes, good guess. I am pretty sure that would hardly cover the transfer or exchange fees from FIAT to crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:25:06
Wouldn't the problem be that online stores who use a singular address system (one deposit address) that they'd be a little too transparent of all activity they have on that account? 
It's much easier to use a service that generates addresses and obfuscate income and expense history of the business to the public. To make custom scripts and to handle this safely for online store all addresses tied to each purchase is daunting and technically scary to say the least. 
Would love to hear if I am misinformed and there is good solutions out there for popular online carts that do not need a intermediate exchange to accept crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:20:25
But is there any services (that are not exchanges or middle man businesses) that offer such a payment system for the most popular cart systems out there? 
I can install plenty of services that can help me accept crypto currencies as payment, but as I understand and experienced the transfer has to go through their service. I am looking for a service that do not do this out of the box (aka Not custom coded solutions). 
The benefit with middle man services are the handling of exchange towards other assets,  such as I can accept every currency,  but I want it converted to for instance only Bitcoin. I have a hard time finding a service/business that can do this without momentarily having my money (I have to trust them). 
Any input appreciated.

Now this is interesting development. I really hope LN will become successful and make BTC better for small and medium sized transfers, it's not "really" needed today, but tomorrow is coming FAST and BTC has put all of their bet on LN the last few years. Looking forward to the progress of making LN adopted by merchants and most important BTC users (new and old).

Minting money (in this case making crypto money physically available for the masses) will always lead to government will eventually intervene or shut down the business. There are some businesses who already sell cards that are preloaded with crypto, so far they are still selling without problems.

I do agree long term demand and savings (hodl) in Bitcoin will increase the price. But focusing on what's happening right now,  maybe, just maybe, the price will continue to fall as fees gets lower (less miner earnings) with full Segwit adoption + Lightning adoption is about to be common (thereby temporarily scares of some % of miners to other places with their computing power). This again creates a potential, but temporary falling in prices of Bitcoin.
However, as Lightning gets more commonly adopted and used, something interesting might happen, that will increase the price continuously: Lightning demand and usage will increase demand for holding Bitcoin both for savings and for usage/availability on the Lightning network, so miners will also be coming back to Bitcoin and increase demand for it as well and make it even safer.

My two cents goes to Bitcoin. I buy through Bitstamp.net and transfer them to my wallet for long term investments (and usage when things are available to buy).

Thank the investors,  you pay with their money. In the future we'll be paying with other investors money when converting Bitcoins to products in the real world. Early adopters reward after risking some money.
Keep on using Bitcoins and be part of the revolution, convert what you can afford of your fiat money to Bitcoin continuously and let your heirs inherit what remains of your savings.

That's why free market competition will solve this as people usually are needed for creating products and services that any currency can buy in the finite world. If one currency ever gets too popular,  the market mechanism will solve it with all its competitors either in competing on its store of value function or other aspects valued by the current savers.

This one should be useful: 
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:29:32
It's not congested at this moment, due to Segwit implementation and a lot of other factors such as for instance less transactions at the moment.
The page shows the fees as the moment for an average transaction. Before you transfer, a recommended transaction fee is usually added (depending what software or service you use).
Why not just try and see. It will be picked up by a miner most probably even if it's less than recommended fee (perhaps not drastically lower, but you get the point). 
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:32:01
Does that mean we'll see the price keep falling as the tech matures (lol).
