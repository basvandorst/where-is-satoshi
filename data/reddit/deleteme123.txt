Know what else is stupid? Generalisations.

It's a scaling issue. Which is being addressed. See lightning network. Almost ready for deployment, I hear. Being developed by arguably the most competent crypto team. Trust.

It's a bandaid fix, at best.

There's already over 300 billions in BTC. U nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:14:57


How much?

Does this method still work? Anyone tried recently?
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:53:40
I just did:
- Paypal (80 USD) -&gt; VirWox (76.98 USD)
- VirWox (76.98 USD) -&gt; VirWox (17,579.86 SLL)
- VirWox (17,579.86 SLL) -&gt; VirWox (0.304 BTC)
- VirWox (0.304 BTC) -&gt; Coinbase wallet (expecting a 0.005 BTC fee)
Coinbase wallet should receive 0.299 BTC, which is equivalent to 67.31 USD (as of 2015-June-01).
All in all, I will be going from 80 USD to 67.31 USD.
Quite the loss.

Why? Doesn't stability increase with adoption? Once user-friendlyness and speed of transaction is fixed, what reasons would the world have to not converge to this currency?

Such as?
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:27:04
Coins that are fun?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:39:59
Hmm. Can anyone else confirm this narrative?

Your common sense is your opinion. The rules don't care about your opinion. This man acted within the rules.

As BTC becomes widely accepted as a form of payment, that  may not be as necessary.

Never heard that one before /s

Aren't there decentralised exchanges?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:30:34
Split wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:41:01
It's spreading like a virus. Don't kid yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:14:33
Same as gold.

I take it you cannot "advertise" on multiple exchanges, correct? Edit: aka  simultaneously trade.
