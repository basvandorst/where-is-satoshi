Then cash out $9000 so you don't lose your investment when the price crash in a few months.

Can a Bitcoin be split infinitely?
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:59:21
Wouldn't it just make Bitcoin rare? I guess nobody would want to buy it since there's a person hording all of it

I think it will drop in price when everyone starts to sell their bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:07:31
Very low or at least very far in the future. Here's my thinking, if no one can crack a wallet, then it means there are only rate of loss but no rate of recovery, following this, it means that Bitcoins will slowly be locked out until it reach a point where Bitcoin as a whole is irrelavent anymore.

What I meant is that the price will crash at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:21:23
What I meant with that is if the amount is too small to be split with a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:58:31
There is a possibility that it could happen but very low, by "critical point" I meant a point where there wouldn't be enough satoshis to go around.

Bitcoin wallet open source one
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:49:13
Ah 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:43:12
I don't remember reinstalling it before transferring the money to the wallet.

And I lost 40 ringgit of Bitcoin yesterday because I thought Bitcoin is stored on the cloud, and you only store the private key to access it
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:04:45
I'm a beginner, I am curious what wallet should I use?   Is Blockchain a good wallet or should I use the open source Bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:42:31
I thought all transactions in Bitcoin are for everyone to see? How could they do that?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:44:57
I'm not very good at this, so I don't get it at all
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:38:06
Okay wierd, I redownloaded the app the restore the wallet, there is nothing in it for 1 hour then there is the exact amount I transferred into it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:32:39
I think the app created a new wallet that I transferred to but I thought I back up the wallet with the money, but I probably baked up the old one. Then I tried to test the recovery and restored the old one while I lost the new one.
