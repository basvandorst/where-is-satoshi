Ah, I guess that's a point.

SMBC is located in Japan, so I doubt it.
EDIT: I misread the OP and they said "SMBC NY" which I guess is "New York".

They cancelled all orders, so it took a while for the order books to fill back up at the "correct" prices.

The issue was already present in 2.3, actually; maybe earlier as well.

Browsers don't allow spoofing the request origin, and remote connections aren't possible by default because the listen address is 127.0.0.1.

The cross-site request was being explicitly allowed by the Electrum JSON-RPC server via CORS; no browser will block this by default, although general protections against scripting like NoScript would be effective to some degree.

I doubt walking into a branch is going to get the problem resolved any faster, it's not like a random bank teller or branch manager will have the authority to handle KYC / AML clearance. Of course, it's not my money either, so I guess it's easy for me to make comments.

From what I've seen, Luno's instant buy/sell is typically about a 2% premium over trading on the exchange directly; if you're considering using it, you'll presumably be in the top fee tier (1%) so I don't think it's that bad.

If you buy a hammer from a hardware store, you don't get to come back the next day to complain about smashing your foot with it. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop people from doing it anyway.

This is most likely linked to the Coinbase lawsuit. Exactly what the connection with current events is, however, gives rise to some interesting speculation...

I guess they're mentioning that BlockChain.info implemented the same new transaction identifier that they did, to show that there is some kind of consensus for their solution.

You won't be able to buy that many bitcoins before pushing the price back up at Mt.Gox; I expect a small-to-medium dip on the other exchanges when (if?) they re-enable withdrawals as people sell their cheap coins, however.
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:54:31
My theory is that somebody with large financial reserves is taking advantage of the liquidity issues at MtGox (can't transfer XBT out, can't transfer fiat in easily over the weekend, or out, but can transfer XBT in) to control the price (primarily by pushing it down), while simultaneously trading short on some derivative instrument (eg. Plus500's BTCUSD CFD which was just terminated hours ago).
I'm just an armchair amateur, so I'd be interested to hear if you think this is feasible.

So how did you buy the LTC without having some other currency there before the buy, and some LTC there after the buy?

The sell-off came shortly after close of business in Japan time. Maybe people just assumed no good news was forthcoming since close of business had passed without any announcement?
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:43:54
Their Twitter account had nothing except posts responding with the *exact same message* to anyone mentioning problems with MtGox and asking that they contact support. No reassurance of anything, anywhere.
@_date: 2014-02-15 11:27:17
They suspended *bitcoin* deposits. Who is going to deposit and sell at these prices?

If advertising targetting was perfect, you would never see an advert you don't want to see. I don't really have a problem with that, it's all the ads I don't want to see that bug me.

To be precise, you can still arbitrage (even though withdrawals are currently disabled), but it requires the following:
1) Enough Bitcoin outside of MtGox to cover what you buy at MtGox until you are able to withdraw them.
2) A belief that you will, in fact, eventually be able to withdraw them.
Even in the event that withdrawals are reenabled, it may take you some time to withdraw everything depending on what the new limits mentioned in their announcement are, so it seems the combination of uncertainty and financial requirements are preventing arbitrage from pushing the price back up.
Note that if somebody is specifically trying to keep the price low for whatever reason (eg. shorting the price via a derivative), this isn't too hard provided they have enough financial resources to keep transferring Bitcoin in, since they can do this much more quickly than anyone can transfer fiat in.

Please bear in mind that Mt. Gox was not originally written by MagicalTux, but by the original owner. While the codebase has clearly been modified since then, I don't think it's fair to use the current codebase as a yardstick for their software engineering ability.

There's some confusion as to whether this means internal transfers or regular external withdrawals.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:07:15
Your LTC isn't money?
@_date: 2014-02-23 11:27:13
I'm not nullc, but as far as I can tell, MagicalTux is a programmer who started a company; in other words, his background is technical, it's more likely that he's out of his depth as a CEO from a business / administrative point of view.

You can't (easily?) transfer USD into MtGox over the weekend, which you would need to buy on MtGox, and you can't transfer XBT out in order to sell it on another exchange, so you would need enough XBT on hand to cover the difference until you can withdraw.
@_date: 2014-02-17 03:43:29
Somebody has dumped over 200,000 (by my estimate) in Bitcoin on MtGox this weekend; I think most people who could buy have already bought.

If they've refused to do business with him, then that would seem to be a redundant thing to "let them know".

Note that assets/liabilities still do not include Bitcoin on hand or claimed, so this may affect the picture by quite a lot.
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:02:13
I think it still makes sense to differentiate an executed transaction by "buy" and "sell" depending on which order was the triggering order. In other words, if you place an ask that fills an existing bid, that's a "sell", and if you place a bid that fills an existing ask, that's a "buy". (But obviously you need both parties for every trade)

FreeBSD-MD5 is not as secure as bcrypt, but it's still a lot more expensive than a plain unsalted MD5 hash. (It uses a random salt for every password, and has 1000 rounds of MD5 that use the salt and password in various ways.) bcrypt still won't stop you from cracking weak passwords.
@_date: 2011-06-21 03:54:03
Note that this is FreeBSD-MD5 style crypt(), which uses 1000 rounds of MD5 and a salt. It's certainly still possible to crack, but it's a lot more expensive than a single MD5 hash, especially an unsalted one like the old passwords use (those are for accounts that haven't logged in since the switchover occurred).
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:45:42
I think you have a misplaced decimal place in your calculations. 30,000 bitcoin * $1000 = $30,000,000 * 0.0025 * 2 = $150,000, not $1.5 million.
