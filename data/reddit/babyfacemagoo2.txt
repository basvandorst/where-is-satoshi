Right, and you see a real shortage of those in Bitcoin, don't you? Oh wait no, actually most of is absolutely fucking rabid. Not to mention that the media coverage from the big, bad, US Govt trying to "ban" Bitcoin would no doubt inspire a whole new generation of zealots to join them. 


Irrelevant, time is relative.
I get what you're saying, the govt. *could*, in theory fuck up Bitcoin pretty badly. But it would be a massive footbullet for them, and would only serve to show them up as out of touch and out of step with their citizens. Nothing new there, admittedly.
The Chinese govt are arguably more hardline than any other government of a major enconomy in the world, and even they have been forced to soften their stance on BTC, because they are coming to realise they can't possibly contain it. I'm sure that these NYC regulations coming in from the US are going to backfire in a similar way, when rather than ask "what do we need to do to comply with you, regulator masters", people actually start asking "what are these regulators actually *for* anyway?".
I think *if* it did happen, and the govt. did decide to go to war with BTC, which is a big if, we would win... eventually.

Not quite. It is now on a difficulty reduction retarget. After the retarget, or maybe 3 or 4 retargets, Mining would become profitable again.
Admittedly, if the drop-off in mining interest was too much, too fast, then that difficulty retarget might take months, but it would happen.
Bitcoin is designed to withstand the very catastrophes you're describing.

Again, crashing the market is not destroying Bitcoin. We've been to $3 and bounced back before. We can do it again.
The protocol would survive, and the Blockchain would too.
Perhaps people would lose confidence in Bitcoin generally if indeed you held a gun to the owner of Ghash.io and forced him to duplicate or invalidate some transactions for you.
However the likelihood of any of that happening is remote, and the actors with the most at stake here, the banks and the governments that rely on fiat currency, would never be able to pull something like that off.
But sure, lets say it happened.
Perhaps this would lead to a mass exodus of funds from Bitcoin and a lot of people losing their shit.
Nevertheless, Bitcoin the protocol would survive. The Blockchain would remain intact, albeit with some stains on the ledger.

Well they sold 30k of publicly held BTC, you're right. The problem with publicly held assets is that they're publicly held.
Now that they've sold them, they have good old fashioned money, albeit still publicly held. However, that money can now be used to buy stuff that the department "needs". After all, that's what publicly held money is *for*, right? Buying stuff or funding stuff to support the activities of government departments which act in the public interest.
If that stuff happens to be sold by a buddy, who happens to share some of the profits with you, then all of a sudden some of that publicly held money becomes privately held.
Harder to do with Bitcoin, because all the transactions are trackable, but very easy to do with Fiat, provided the banks are looking the other way, which they almost always are.
@_date: 2014-07-29 12:26:44
Depends on your definition of "effective" I suppose.
No you could not live entirely on Bitcoin unless you were prepared to break the law. 
I mean some drug dealers live entirely on cash and never pay any taxes, I guess living entirely on Bitcoin would be the same thing, so yeah it is entirely possible, regardless of the legality of doing such a thing.
Whether or not you would actually want to is another question entirely, given how difficult it would be to buy food, pay your bills etc, but it would certainly be feisable.
However, I don't see that being able to survive only using Bitcoin as a necessity for it to be a useful currency, and for that usefulness to drive mining activity such that the network is secured.
The darknet markets provide more than enough reason for Bitcoin to exist, and their size provides more than enough demand for Bitcoin to ensure that mining is a worthwhile activity, regardless of legality, and that exchange to and from fiat is a worthwhile activity, regardless of legality.
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:46:12
Eh? You could insure Bitcoin just as easily as you could insure money, what are you bleating about?
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:46:05


Yes and no. In terms of practicality of using it to buy things and converting fiat in and out of Bitcoin, yes. In terms of the functionality of the protocol and network, no.
But the question was not "Can the government change Bitcoin from being respected and legal apparatus for transferring wealth between law-abiding citizens and businesses".
It was "Can the government destroy bitcoin".
It absolutely cannot. It can make it highly unattractive to use, even illegal, which would of course have repercussions on the price, number of users, ease of use, etc, but it cannot be destroyed.
@_date: 2014-07-29 15:11:01
No it can't.
Perhaps in one country it can be done, one with a very strict and authoritarian government. They could successfully clamp down on Bitcoin in Saudi Arabia, say.
But across all countries where Bitcoin exists? No.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:20:29
The fiat price today is irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-07-29 11:43:47
Government could never stop people exchanging Bitcoins for cash or goods.
They could make it illegal for people to buy it, sure, but then prohibition has never really worked in the past.
The most government could do would be to shut down exchanges under their jurisdiction, and try to enforce international law to shut down other exchanges.
All that would happen is that exchanges would start to operate underground, you would still be able to cash in and out, albeit at a much lower price, which is what you really care about.
Dat speculation profitz yo.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:47:11
its speculation, not data. you can tell by my use of the words "should", "might" and "probably"

disagree that a $10k purchase would 'move the market'. it would need to be a $100k purchase, and the movement would typically be in both the merchant's and the customer's favour.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:45:48
it was, yeah. you'll notice the network is still here and functioning correctly, despite the efforts of 'the best hackers'.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:48:56
you need millions of dollars worth of ASICs to compete with even a small scale mining operation. if the price crashed so low that there was only a small number of miners it would not be worth it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:18:43
we should see $250 today probably. $200 this week. might bottom at $180, might dip lower still.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:51:17
you don't know how market liquidity works.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:18:00


Bitcoin is.
To destroy it at this point would require destroying significant numbers of computers in every developed country in the world, and doing so before backups and mirrors could hastily be arranged.
Even the USA doesn't have that kind of reach.


This is what you're really worried about. The fiat price of your coins today or tomorrow. Yes, the US Govt could crash Bitcoin to $1 for a few weeks, months, years maybe, but they'd never be able to destroy it.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:13:51
investment is fine, when you invest in something that is productive or useful, like a business or a property. bitcoin was never supposed to be an investment, it was supposed to be a currency. 
people buying low and hoarding, hoping to get rich quick like about 100 people total did on the $1200 bubble, deserve all they get.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:35:40
nope, people using bitcoin to buy drugs on the darknet markets is what keeps it alive. a healthy number of people willing to exchange coins to and from dollars, regardless of which direction the price is trending and how quickly, is essential to prevent speculators either stagnating the market or crashing the price to zero.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:59:59
at $1 a coin, the total bitcoin economy would be worth about $500k. hardly worth spending a few million on asics and electricity on.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:21:41
Sure, but with a very healthy dose of inflation and "Quantitative Easing" as well.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:55:22


i dont know what kind of "major commerce" you have in mind, but sure, lets accept that you need a minimum of $20M liquidity available on the exchanges at any one time for BTC to remain useful. lets say that 5% of all coins are traded on the exchanges, and the others are in storage or lost. so 500k coins are available to commerce.
this means btc must have a price of at least $40 to remain useful to "major commerce". Seems like we can go a lot lower than $280 with no real worries. And actually as more and more coins are mined and find their way to the exchanges, that figure gets lower.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:17:05
pretty much, yes.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:50:30
why would you spend a few hundred grand on ASICs only to turn them off to save a few bucks in power costs? 
you will find most miners are willing to mine even at $1, even though they are losing money. They carry on, in the hopes that the price will one day rebound and they can break even on what they spent on ASICs
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:43:42
it'll never happen anyway, so why worry about it? darknets will keep the price of a bitcoin above $20, and even at that price, someone will care enough to keep their ASICs powered up. you need every autistic mining farm owner to have the same apathy, even one guy still clinging on to hope that the price will go up again means that a single malicious miner cannot own the network.
it takes a large number of very unlikely conditions to be true before a single miner controls the network, and one of these conditions is that the network has so little value anyway, that its not worth mining or spending effort to make sure nodes are not compromised. and even if one miner could control the whole network, it almost always is more profitable for him to mine bitcoins than to try and disrupt the network or create fake transactions.
at the point where it makes more sense for someone with 51% hashrate and control of the majority of nodes to fuck with bitcoin as a protocol than for the attacker to simply use that massive hashrate to mine normally for profit, then bitcoin would be a lost cause anyway, and i would not care in that case if it did get hacked.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:20:02
which makes him just as guilty as the thieves themselves
