If it was 12,900 to 10,000 then that was a dip, a 100$  at this moment is well within normal variance. Check in therms of percentage value.

3 hours in a normal day. Today is not a normal one. Another 1k barrier busted, so much buy and sell transaction going on.

Almost every important commodity ( even grain) has a futures contract. It's used to hedge against risk ( it's like a issuance contract, but in a narrower field)

Because of so much transaction volumn, miners have been valuing transactions with higher fees, to include in block. Those with lower get behind. If it was a lower transaction day, they would include yours more quickly. It's simple economics at miner level

A ~~future~~ options contract  is a contract when you define the following: at a future date I have the option to buy X of a financial product at a price Y, regardless of at that time price, but for that I pay a fee of Z.
What that means is that you have a buy/sell contract that fixes the transaction at a price in the future. For example imagine that you created a future that says in 20 days you would sell 1 BTC  €. Now 3 things can happen in 20 days:
- the price of BTC is exactly 10000
- the price is higher than 10000
- the price is lower than 10000
The first case can happen, but it's of no value for futures. 
The second case could leave for a loss of value. Here the option is not exercised, so the only loss is the fee value.
The third is the sweet one, although the reference price is lower, you can activate the contract and so you could sell that bitcoin at 10000€.
Sorry, I confused a options contract with a futures contract. The main difference is that options one above indicated you have the "option" of exercising the option, while futures they are obligated to the terms negotiated. The main use of futures is to hedge against market volatility.

Investopedia has some nice articles in common market lingo that all starting on this things should read. I will post here some links:

When you buy bitcoin think it's like gold. You don't generally buy a gold bullion, but small pieces. And it's never too late. And bitcoin cannot be shutdown by any 1 government. It had to be a global effort, because it would have to close all points on contact at the same time. Do you think a government can close the internet at this point. It's the same

I checked that, btw. Just asking a honest opinion about the blockchain.info site. 
One of the questions was answered there, the fees. I just got one for the payment processing fee, but no fee for bitcoin processing.

I think and by the time lapse ( dip was from 15:25-15:30 gmt Lisbon time  period) that a whale sold all it's bitcoin at market value. I think it was anxiety for the NASDAQ bitcoin announcement. Problem is instead of doing it with a iceberg order, he went balls deep with a very big market order. Then of course all stop orders activated and chaos started.
