Okay but yes I do.

The thing is you don’t have to know how bitcoin works to use it. Just get some in your account and you can do what you want.
So that leaves stability. The US dollar has dealt with 2275% inflation over 100 years, it’s been relatively stable, but $5 has not and will not always be worth $5. I suppose you could say that a currency has to be within a certain level of stability, but no one argued that confederate dollars weren’t ‘real currency’ when they were in use, or Zimbabwe or Russian currency.

I don't care for ROI. I have an old iPod Touch just sitting around doing literally nothing. I'll take 5 cents a year.
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:56:18
Oh, it definitely can...for a price.
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:49:35
Thanks mate!

Let me make this clear: I agree with most of what you're saying. As things stand, I wouldn't like to have bitcoin as the primary currency for the reasons you've laid out. Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum maybe...
But anyway, I don't deny it has problems. But you *can* buy things with bitcoin, and pretty easily too. Google will get you a ton of places that you can buy from things with bitcoin, quickly and easily. The limit you speak of isn't much of a limit with the internet in existence.
Yeah, the price fluctuations are ridiculous. But they happen across all currencies, and with some currencies even to the same extent. The only thing I'm saying is that I believe that bitcoin *is a currency*. Not that it's the best one out there, or even a particularly good one, but that it *is* one.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:37:30
Yes, I do. 10k to 11k is pretty consistent for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:58:29
Mythical? Do you think it doesn't work?
And if you look at this chart, the fees *are* going down. They're half as high as they were at peak, and still dropping.

If it quacks like a duck...
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:35:05
I'd probably just plug it into my workstation. Free (for me) electricity!
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:51:27
Naw mate, just impractical for smaller uses. Buying anything over a hundred dollars or so and the percentage goes back down compared to conventional methods. Of course, until very recently the fees were just a few cents. They fluctuate just as the price does, so we should see them going down soon.

in July that it is accepting bitcoin 


There are a ton more; check the first link.

It's been relatively consistent for about a month now. Stale meme.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:00:31
Okay, so what makes something money?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:12:28
I’m not racist, I have some black friends.

[](/ajfrown)[](/sp)I mean...let's all be honest with ourselves here. I bought bitcoin because I like the idea of it, not because I thought I'd got rich off it. I do think it's a bubble. It's not a currency anymore like it was when everyone was using it to buy drugs. I can't say whether it'll eventually fall down to a more reasonable price or level off at a million dollars a coin, because I can't see the future.
If you're treating bitcoin as an investment, I'd stay away, because that's gambling with your livelihood.

No u :P

You can tell by the way it is.

It's back!
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:46:40
Yup. And yes, I did mean Ethereum. :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:20:11
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:20:34
~~Electrum~~ Ethereum, however, is.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:45:22
Or...*or*...and hear me out, this is gonna sound pretty crazy, but...
Or...you could just tell me. Like a normal person.
