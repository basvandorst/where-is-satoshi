You might as well have never discovered it because you dont even have enough in there to cover the transfer fee even if you did want to move it. You are in fee purgatory.

The problem with Bitcoin is that its not usable as digital money. Lightning network is not moving fast enough (ironically). There are multiple other technologies out there that are more promising than bitcoin. The problem is, Bitcoin is the "reserve cryptocurrency" and when bitcoin suffers, so does the market as a whole. 
We need to move the crypto space forward by decoupling from Bitcoin as its becoming a dated and unusable technology.

Unless theres a fucking worldwide EMP blast that takes out the grid, in which case bitcoin is the least of our problems, I dont think we have to worry about Bitcoin failing.

Unfortunately, the second image is not even close to happening. We still need the banking system to convert BTC into fiat. Unless every retailer and business accepts bitcoin overnight. Theres also the transaction scaling of Bitcoin. Not even close to what the banking system is capable of. We've still got a long way to go.

Last time I looked, I think the LedgerX platform is for large institutions and individuals worth millions of dollars. Its not for the plebs.

Thats pretty interesting. Looks like the establishment media is floating the idea that gold and bitcoin is funding terrorism, which will probably be banned in the future.
