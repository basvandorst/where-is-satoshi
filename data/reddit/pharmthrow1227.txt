So what happens if he gets elected and then fights net neutrality and then no one can use anything because the Comcast/TWC conglomerate slows everyone down to a crawl except whoever pays their ransom?

They'll continue to do that even if he is elected. Has nothing to do with net neutrality

Comcast, TWC, and Verizon are all outspoken against bet neutrality. There's a huge percent of the ISPs, and in a lot of my region the only 2 are Comcast and Verizon. 
Verizon also had the best coverage. Again in my region, if you live in a rural area, it's Verizon or nothing.
T-mobile is already giving preferential treatment to music service. 
If one company is going to fuck the customers, and there's nothing to stop them, all the companies will fuck customers. It's how capitalism works. Profit above all else.

Brought to you by companies against net neutrality...

And where is this magical wireless Internet coming from that's not a major ISP? Google is a long way off from blanketing the nation in broadband speeds, and even then I still don't want a single company controlling everyone's internet.

So you're fine with a monopoly that charges outrageous prices because they can and there wouldn't be shit all consumers could do but move and hope that company doesn't decide to do the same?

Something like 30% of Americans only have 1 ISP choice, and if you count only broadband providers that number increases. And given the histories of Comcast and TWC, I'm not optimistic about leaving the market unregulated. I'm of the opinion that with no oversight, they'll continue their trend of screwing people out of money. If they're allowed to merge, it'll get even worse. They have done literally nothing to indicate otherwise. 
Then again, I have no faith in corporations. With enough power, they make their own rules.
