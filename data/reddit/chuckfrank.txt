We are turning into r/The_Coin

I don't think so. I think this was done by medium. The whole thing stinks a bit. I can imagine that the co got a cease and desist, or whatever the Canadian equivalent is from the judge.

I think someone took the Medium article down. Medium does this when pushed or pressured. I doubt anyone else is working the exit scam, though lawyers might have been hired by those that are.

Medium page down. Someone didn't like this analysis.

No murder happened.

DPR ordered the hits. Several people had access to the account, including the feds. No evidence was presented that Ross ordered the hits. And even if he did, it's their responsibility to prove it 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' Law is, as the law is.
He did enable hardcore drug sales, for better or worse. Book him for that. What 20 years, out in 10? Order him to stay off a computer. Done.
But we can go around and around for the rest of his life sentence. I'm right, you're wrong, but you won, and Ross is in jail until he dies, unless some future president pardons him, because there's no way Trump cares unless this becomes some pet project of a famous celebrity.

1. The Dread Pirate Roberts account ordered the hits. 
2. Many people, including the feds had access to the account.
3. This was a murder-for-hire case, no one was actually killed.
4. He wasn't charged, wasn't able to defend himself, and wasn't convicted on the charge - most likely because it was impossible to make the case that DPR account was Ross at the time, also because of the other fed shenanigans, like stealing bitcoins.
5. If he was charge and convicted, average sentences are NOT double-life.
So no, Nick Bilton is also a dumbass selling the feds narrative.

Oh so we are comparing it to a Reddit forum, even though she completely dismisses major wrong doing by the feds. And she buys the whole 'email-out-in-the-wild' without question. Fact is, the feds had illegal access to Silk Road the whole time. There's no doubt that they could have planted any evidence that they wanted. Clearly he's guilty of something, but not what the gov't claimed he is. Besides, I believe that some leniency is necessary since as a society we were still coming to terms with what should and should not be allowed to be sold on international marketplaces.
Like, if hash is legal here, is it legal to sell it here? regardless of where I sell it online.
Internet marketplaces changed to notion of buying and selling at a legal standpoint. 
Like what if you buy a toy on Alibaba that hasn't been approved for sale in America? Who is criminally liable if a child chokes on a piece of it and dies? The seller, Alibaba, the buyer? The shipper? Customs, if they let it in? 
Ross admits to selling mushrooms, and admits to taking a fee from the selling of drugs that were illegal in some jurisdiction. Should he really be sentenced to double-life?
Give me a break with your bs.
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:42:51
that book's total bs.
never digs into the feds irregularities.
it's a play by play for the government perspective.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:17:48
I know, right! (nearly.)
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:58:53
Your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:17:20
like I said, I wanted the little fella on the rollercoaster feeling whoozy.
@_date: 2018-11-14 01:41:39
He's in for a fair bit, so now what? Leave him to rot?
We get it. 
But most murder-for-hire sentences are much shorter than double-life.
Come now.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:13:44
Ha! it's called a 'honey-bitcoin-trap', or just a 'trap' for short.
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:18:06
nope. I won't.
