I had a bank that wouldn't let me buy using coinbase

Yeah my dad is invested in ethereum he likes it. I personally don't have anything in it. Could you just explain those to me how you see it? I like getting people's opinion in real time. Since its a people world.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:40:31
Why exactly was it designed this way? What's the bigger picture?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:34:30
I do understand your point. I was there once. I just think different now. I hope it succeeds oh my god I do. I want to see fiat die with the corruption that built it but I don't think it's realistic and everyone who is new to bitcoin just wants to convert it back to their fiat

People don't see an innovative idea they see $$$$$
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:51:14
I own no bitcoins I invested all into XRP.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:59:38
Extremely well put I feel like I understand a whole lot more now.

Unless there is no one who will. If there are more sellers than it becomes a problem. So never sell and the price will always continue upward. That's why we "Hodl" because if we all sell to buy our lambos then what happens? The price plummets until someone is willing to spend the money, if no one ever is, then  what

I believe they are looking at ripple though. You know, the currency built for banks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:41:31
I personally am invest all into XRP. I'm trying to broaden my horizons on this because this is literally the future of money 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:18
They're making their own?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:56:54
Well what's the bigger picture? I don't really support bitcoin cash just because of its name. I know that's something it's just coin cash? Not enough effort. What is bitcoin planning for the long run big picture

Farting in the wind. Not pissing in the wind

What does fud stand for? I mean I appreciate the optimism but we can still be realistic. Bitcoin obviously isn't dead but this is a set back. Steam broke up with us :( they even said it's not them it's us. Worst kind 
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:06:17
That's really not many and Im just trying to figure out how many people actually are using bitcoins and if the number is increasing and that's what's driving the value up or the same people are just spending more money on it now 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:40:47
What do you think about Ripple?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:03:30
No buy more anyway and hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:27:43
I told someone and they said bitcoin is what they use in jail. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:03:18
No dont sell! Hodl!
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:19:33
I hope to see bitcoin succeed. I just can't imagine it overthrowing banks. Buy the dip means the same people are buying over and over again which is driving up the price. I think a crypto currency that works with banks would be ideal. Because unfortunately for the masses bitcoin already has a bad reputation for human trafficking, drug dealing, and hacking. People are afraid of it and I see this in my public life.

:) just another wave. This ship will sail on and on
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:05:49
DON'T PANIC AND SELL FOR THE LOVE OF BUDDAH
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:10:34
The XRP network is decentralized and can operate without Ripple. It can not be mined it has to be bought. Making more would go against their protocol rules. Plus ripple was designed to decrease the available amount over time. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:26:47
I really can't tell you
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:50:08
I bought then too I meant more at 1200 maybe even 100
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:06:07
I bought more :)
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:24:17
I know they live in the ocean or something like that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:53:23
Hey it's all good. Very interesting coin in my opinion. There are fees but no one gets them. The fees are destroyed to prevent DDos attacks. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:58:15
I meant this post more as satire.
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:29:46
They won't even let me buy a bitcoin anymore so screw them I'm with you
@_date: 2017-04-08 00:24:22
I don't get it:(

That's what I thought and I will never!

I learned that the longest chain is the one that is the most current. What stops someone from just making their chain the longest? Also, where does the communication happen to measure each others chain size to validate who has rightful ownership?

New here: what is HODL
