@_date: 2017-12-21 11:53:55
isnt s9 antminer hard to get ?
it is manufactured by bitmain only and gets sold out.
i read this on other subs.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:17
Coinbase or exchange - no.
Bitcoin core wallet on a usb with tails os - yes
Backup private keys of all btc always.

This thread makes me feel good nd relaxed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:50:57
high fees are a big problem.
wonder what is the reason for the high fees and how alts are trying to solve this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:49:21
why are the fees getting so high in bitcoin ?
i am not much worried about volatility as that could be solved automatically with time, matured market
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:41:59
is LN gonna be paid ?
does it take money to open a channel ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:19:57
i dislike doing it anyway.
man must be made for creative pursuits.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:32:26
Ah ok.
So you dont have to boot from usb.
Also you dont have to first sign the transaction offline from usb and then going back to your online host computer to send it.
I get it now.
Maybe someday...

i was at a bitcoin meetup when price was 700.
zebpay was doing 1 crore plus in volume.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:51:27
same :)
unocoin , zebpay were popular when price was at 700.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:15:19
thanks - i shall go through this.
i am a noob.
should i read mastering bitcoin first ?
how do i go about understanding code, architecture.
i am looking for a learning path please.
i know C programming well.
i also know oops concepts, ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:24
i have a guitar , bicycle.
but i love them both although my job doesnt allow me to play with either.
should i sell ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:43:50
no - i checked many times - hours. never happens.
if it crashes to 9k and stuff then it might happen - but such a crash looks unlikely atleast atm.
buy it when you have money and hodl is a strategy i pick now.
one problem for me is my banks daily debit limit is only 1000 $ 
need to fix that soon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:52:02
although the prices in indian exchanges are always higher than the ones on coingecko.com, coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:11:37
is the &lt;good morning&gt; part sarcasm ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:30:21
Thank you all for replies.
I shall post about my journey here.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:10:05
i tried bitcoin core.
it is not compulsary at all to download the blockchain.
you can use features without downloading blockchain.
only it will not be able to get your balances in corrcet manner as it doesnt have the data from blockchain
you can check your balances manually from any block explorer.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:29:30
if you have only 6000 $ in savings.
it makes sense to put it all on the line to be able to buy half bitcoin.
6000 $ is not life changing anyway.
plus its a challenge to work, earn more and be able to save quickly to be safe.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:50:32
price at unocoin is low now.
although btc is rising.
jump on it if you can .
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:15:26
From electrum ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:26:51
Select lowest fee.
If time to receive is not critical - zero fee is also ok.
The lower the fee - the later you receive.
Zero fee also works.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:41:42
Usb with tails will be offline.
Admin password will be off.
Wallet is stored in encrypted storage.
You can put the usb with tails on compromised machine as well.
And create the signed transaction while being offline.
The compromised machine or your mobile phone just sends the signed transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:32:36
Still cant figure out what is the point of eth ?
Who uses smart contracts in real life.
I have never automated my rent, electricity bills ever.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:33:40
You selected zero fees and still got charged?
Please raise a bug with your transaction id mentioned.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:31
Select your own fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:18:20
you are right - icici is not listed even now.
i had this problem with uno coin
so i tried doing neft from icici to idbi - my other account.
sadly - i didnt have a debit card of icici so i went to the bank and did a manual neft.
also broke all my FD's,  RD's  for btc love.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:36:10
Hodl btc.
Why u like eth ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:47:09
 i use paper wallet javascript code.
I make my computer go offline.
i generate a new address.
so now - will this generated address be unique ?
how will uniqueness be assured when my computer is offline ?
please guide.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:29
multisig ?
please give link for this.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:29:23
do you mean that the code is real awesome ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:17:58
No worry man.
Chill buddy.
Just go to github.com
Search for electrum
Create issue.
Give them transaction id.
Just to repeat - never never type or share your private keys with anybody.
Anyone having your private key has your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:03:53
So why do you like eth ?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:38:11
price is not dropping on indian exchanges at all man.
even if it drops on coinbase, coingecko - price on unocoin,koinex stays up :)
so the dip is not coming to india even if btc dips.
i was up last night to verify this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:21:20
Usb with tails 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:32:14


are the devs working on this ?
maybe altcoins can chip in with the solution.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:04:35
koinex is lower - much lower than unocoin now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:21:18
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:08:44
You plug in the usb to any computer.
Now boot from usb instead of booting from your hard drive.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:33:57
Right now - i shall use a spending wallet on mobile phone .
Maybe bitcoin core or mycelium
And savings wallets on usb.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:49
Why ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:54:53
Does the bitcoin core client make it compulsary to download the full blockchain ?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:27:58
How does one know for sure that fiat is broken.
How can one verify this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:05:50
Sublime text ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:55:52
Well written sir.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:38:22
if i do createrawtransaction followed by signtransaction and then broadcast from the console of bitcoin qt 
then is segwit activated ?
i am using bitcoin core 15.1
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:07:51
Never goes online.
You only send transaction from online computer.
Convenience - just boot the damn usb and done.
Its like a full new computer in your pocket.
Play chess or edit audios if you feel like too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:16:33

hey friend,
how to get started contributing ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:10:25
I got a new address from bitaddress.
I wrote it on paper.
Then i sent some btc to it.
All good.
Then i wanted to send btc from my new address back .
Now i had to type my private address .
Isnt typing my private address into the keyboard risky ?
Should i type my private address only when my computer is offline ?
Also for convenience - i pasted my address in a text file on my computer - so i can easily copy paste it when i need it .
Is storing the keys in a txt file on computer very risky ?
I kinda had to do this as typing the keys by hand were painful and probably risky from security perspective.
So my questions are :
How should i easily transfer my paper wallet into computer for transactions.
How can i maintain strong security while using my paper wallet for transactions.
Atm i do not feel like putting money down for a hardware wallet.
When i make good money soon - i shll surely buy hardwre wallet

How to buy dips with fiat money ?

Wear shorts.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:48:13
thanks a ton for this explaination. its awesome.
can LN be a starting point for new miners / developers?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:20:53
As a programmer what is a good learning path to start contributing.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:15:39
Usb with tails ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:31:48
Which country?
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:49:40
What benefits will we see when LN is released.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:05:43
In real life do you make bets ?
I hardly do.
I am all ears eager to learn.
But i dont make bets , smart contracts today.
Do you ?
