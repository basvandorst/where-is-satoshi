I don't think i can agree. Segwit already has an economic incentive (lower fees) but it's not being used by companies that you say shouldn't be ignoring wasting money on fees
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:31:23
and STILL there are transactions at 200+
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:32:19
You mean spread? That's nothing, we've seen 500$ spreads
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:25:04
You call that a pump?
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:25:45
I guess you weren't here when China banned btc last time and Jamie dimon called it a fraud
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:20:33
True this is the end. "This time is differenti"
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:30:21
Banks cant stop you from using btc, thats a fact. Cryptocurrency doesnt have to be PRIVATE. Bitcoin is not anonymous. So dont seek anonymity in a coin that isnt supposed to be anonymous. Go use monero
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:37:55
I mean it's not like we are against increasing the block size. That's what we have done for years. But like with internet protocol, its time to  stop just trying to make faster cables for our LANs and instead make switches and routers (lvl 2 or 3 solutions for scalability)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:05:02
Down in the comments this guy is saying ethereum is a ponzi scheme...??
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:31:51
Segwit is also not affected by how many use it... Yet many blame it for the inefficiency of the whole network right now
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:43:28
Wait what? I dont have full control of my funds? I tought it was all trustless just as bitcoin. I think I'm missing something
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:51:57
This is a totally legit question. Manipulation can happen both upwards and downwards. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:15:39
oh ok i see. thank you a lot
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:07:21
You wanna be picky? It can go to 0.00001
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:29:32
You can be stupid and make a lot of money by being lucky
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:11:40
Any data point that suggests this?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:55:12
1) Layer 1 is supposed to be decentralized in cryptos.
2) yes we do trust a website when we buy bitcoins. That is literally the reason for which we want trustless currencies ( Such as bitcoin). The problem is the website, not btc
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:22:29
what does "capacity" mean in this context? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:53:36
yes that's exactly what i'm saying. everyone forgets that even very small increases daily build up.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:54:32
as if there was any drawback at all in using segwit... it's not like something bad happens to you if you use it. Only good things so it literally makes no sense not to use it
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:00:46
I only see paypal :(
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:15:26
Does Lightning require Segregated Witness?
Yes, but not in theory. You could make a poorer lightning network without it, which has higher risks when establishing channels (you might have to wait a month if things go wrong!), has limited channel lifetime, longer minimum payment expiry times on each hop, is less efficient and has less robust outsourcing. The entire spec as written today assumes segregated witness, as it solves all these problems.
How are we going to deploy lightning network if we struggle to get 10% of transactions to use segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:21:19
Thats not what i said...
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:30:41
OK i am sorry, small dollar amount made me forgot about percentages. You're right
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:00:45
Remember that you need only like 0.5% profit a day to make a huge amount of money in a year
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:25:40
I mean it's not like banks can do anything to stop btc because they can be linked back to me. Also bitcoin isn't a privacy coin, if you need to be anonymous you can use other cryptos 
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:29:31
Why not just keep everything on the ln enabled wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:58:43
excuse me are you using logic here?
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:51:23
Ok i see. So with the network growing it will be basically a non problem
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:57:23
I mean lightning isn't really "here". It's on the testnet :(
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:33:11
4th option: you sell now, cut your losses, and buy back when it's higher... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:07:20
Yes its like if we tried to scale internet by adding bandwith instead of switches and routers
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:13:10
So currencies can't lose value? then venezuela has no currency?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:23:27
Wtf? I tought lightning was only on the testnet!
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:59:50
Not really, if you remove the center "hubs" ln network still functions perfectly. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:39:51
enlarging block size is like trying to scale internet by only making bigger cables (not level 2, 3 ... solutions)
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:43:24
Tell us which coins actually do this
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:59:40
It's not even 20% in a day
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:34
Lol. Not even hodling. Buying more is way to go
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:33:18
No. I defined a normal market. This works with: gold, silver, diamonds, houses, AND bitcoin. If this is your definition of a ponzi then literally anything that is sellable and buyable is a ponzi
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:59
OMG. I just got mind blown.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:31:10
The block reward just keeps getting halved every once in a while, it will never go to 0. The mining rewars will be 0.0001 btc eventually and it is expected to be more valuable than it is now
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:35:31
This isn't really true. Let's exclude leveraged positions for simplicity. Now, if I buy in at 1$ and I sell a year after at 2$ to somebody else, I gained 1$ and the guy who bought lost 0$. Then the other guy sells another 1 year later for 3$, and he made 1$ as well. Nobody lost money, the only thing that was lost is "potential profit" meaning that they *could have* made more money, but that's true for literally any person In the world (even the guy who first bought at 1$)
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:28:31
There cant be ASIC if its not proof of work.
Lightning network is still Being tested and developed
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:25:00
Thanks man. Glad you were able to explain , i m not as good as you In english
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:10:57
eli 5 schnorr?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:36:15
in what was it better than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:41:04
Yes, i was just saying that, for instance when we keep breaking ath after ath, there are situations in which you making money doesn't mean other people are losing it
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:21:28
nodes, not wallets
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:54:46
I've got nothing to do so i'll try and explain
1) decentralized means that there isn't a central entity administrating the system, i.e. torrent 
2) ASIC are special chips used and designed specifically to mine cryptos
3) lightning network is a scalability solution for transactions 
4) Blockchain is basically a database in which transactions are batched in blocks. the 1st block is linked to the 2nd one and so on. One can rebuild the current state of the system by going through all of the blocks.
Why alts follow btc? i mean that's not really true. Sometimes they do, sometimes they go the opposite direction
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:01:04
Then every currency in the world is a ponzi
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:59:29
I'm bullish 
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:18:52
Yes, which is exactly what has been happening with bitcoin. What I'm saying isn't that nobody lost money in the btc market, I'm just saying that there can be a situation in which one guy gaining money doesn't mean anyone is losing money
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:12:36
i'd say that for 100$ it's worth it to keep it on the exchange itself. So you won't pay a network fee
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:33:03
Yes. So?
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:56:07
1) nothing
2) eth
3) no
4) It is by definition theoretically able to change to proof of stake. This doesn't mean that it will
5) Idk sorry
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:32:41
Dollar cost averaging is in a way trying to time the market too
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:31:10
This seems more reasonable. So basically don't do something if you aren't good at it 
@_date: 2017-08-20 22:08:52
Can somebody explain to me why a lot of people suggest to "just hold" the bitcoins instead of trading a lot? I (possibly in a stupid fashion) thought that if you really trust the rise of the price of the bitcoin, then you should try and use compound interest and keep cashing in your profit and reinvesting it in more bitcoin. What am i missing?
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:13:43
Isn't it on the wayback machine anyways?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:20:55
Why even make a loan then?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:57:53
What can i do about it?
@_date: 2019-02-07 00:40:39
My mom asked me the same thing. She came back from work and she said: I read on the newspaper that the owner of Bitcoin died and he was the only one having the password!!! Is that true??m
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:05:09
Today i opened my coinbase app and i was Like OMG price dropped to 6800. Then i realized it was in euros lol
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:38:20
Coinbase has huge fees, coinbase pro has really small fees.  
Actually coinbase pro used to be free which is why I started using it.
I would suggest coinbase pro
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:29:53
OK, i guess its a way to margin  trade without the premium then
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:44:18
Bitcoin is DEAD! Doomed! Not just another entry in the btc obituaries. This time "it's different"
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:49:59
But you don't need an account to watch they charts, I can watch theirs without logging in. 
Or try TradingView
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:01:06
How much do fees drop if i start using segwit and where can i find this specific information? Is there a website for it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:50:25
Sooo tempted to just go all in, because of that picture where the graph is USD/BTC instead of BTC/USD.
Makes it look like I'm losing money even if i'm 20% in crypto
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:42:54
Can't you still watch their charts? 
My other option would've been trading view...
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:46:30
I did ;)
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:36:45
You click buy button on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:09:07
There are decentralized exchanges already. The most popular i know of is "etherdelta"
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:47:54
@_date: 2018-03-19 19:40:07
He's right but saying it not in the friendliest way. Lightning won't be used by many until its integrated with coinbase or other GUIs, just like segwit
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:18:21
Good question. If your concern is lowering the fees : try gdax. 0% fees on limit orders!
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:03:01
Neither. Use BTC when you need it and buy it again if you feel like you don't want to have less of it
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:16:29
I'm not sure how roger can say things like "bitcoin is unreliable" and get away with that. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:11:22
You can with mew
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:09:00
If you are a maker fees are literally 0%
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:48:35
Meanwhile gdax has  zero. Amazing, if only they had more coins...
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:38:56
wtf? Crypto biggest feature is anonimity? no way
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:49:28
Potential r/titlegore here
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:40:47
Then how can you even say something like "the fact that we are all on the same bitcoin blockchain"?  I mean... If there were two blockchains, one of them would not be bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:36:24
I don't think it's likely that this giant bitcoin entity bought in at more than 4200... so if it didn't manage to drop it down below their original entry point, it's not worth it 
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:54:57
Didnt you want to buy at 8k and 9k  too? 
Edit: cause i wanted
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:45:14
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:09:43
It will still warn of imminent crash and talk about how bitcoin is dead :p
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:25:06
Thank you very much I feel like I learned a lot tonight. Worth my time 
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:19:13
Gdax (owned by coinbase) has 0% fees ! If you want to try it I'll give you my referral link, if you buy 100$ of btc on coinbase it will give you 10$ more of btc. Then you can use the same account to trade on gdax 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:24:51
Yes i mean THIS TIME IT IS DIFFERENT trust me
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:24:04
unfortunately i don't know what that is so while i google it up i'll ask if that should solve the scalability problem for a long time
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:04:14
You clicked on some YouTuber's link or some body you follow
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:19:01
But they literally give you your bitcoin address and you can look it up on a block chain explorer. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:59:05
Wow amazing :) 
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:05:20
Quick question: what is the closest thing to myetherwallet for bitcoin? Want to move btc to a segwit address while fees are low.
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:30:58
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:49:48
OK I see. Thanks. so for example lightning network will be another upgrade that will show consensus again. :)
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:31:51
I'm completely sure that hardware wallets are the best. I was just making questions
@_date: 2018-02-28 12:08:01
What fork?
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:00:34
I still can't manage to freaking own my keys! Where do i find them lol
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:15:36
Apple stock is Ponzi as well then
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:22:51
Just use gdax then? owned by coinbase, no fees
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:07:48
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:19:18
examples of when we've seen the vast majority of every sector coming to agreement with past upgrades?
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:45:42
What i love in crypto: decentralization and speed of transactions
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:11:38
Its basically the fee they get. Dont want to pay that? Use limit orders on gdax (same company, same account)
@_date: 2017-09-06 15:22:30
looks like it was 92 billion. But what happened after? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:10:24
Then the only explaination is you bought at around  6000$. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:10:23
Moving money throu traditional sistems is super slow and by using bitcoin I'm sure nobody will ever be able to freeze my account
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:59:19
Are you sure you're buying btc? 4 bucks down on 10 dollars -&gt; 40% loss. Bitcoin price didnt drop 40%
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:12:49
Coinbase referral program. If you register with my referral link you get 10$ in btc when you buy 100$ of any crypto
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:03:51
I'd get 100% as of now. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:36:49
I see. Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:09:56
So if bcash is doomed because of that, why is bitcoin not doomed then? I'm genuinely asking because i'm new and i don't know
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:18:19
How do you know? You couldve clicked on literally any link that looked "normal" to you, but it was actually a "hidden" referral link
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:07:49
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:15:48
What? I'm a student and i dont see how losing all the money i made in a summer would ruin my life time carriers
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:26:16
Thanks. Its a free hardware wallet then :)
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:55:33
I am watching a long in depth video about this and It seems like the problem is : the hierarchical solution should be TRUSTless am I right?
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:58:25
Since there are bitcoins lost forever, does this mean that we will have less than 21 million in the end?
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:26:10
He "forgot" again
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:43:36
The answer to your question is: because they want to make money. Thats it
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:47:03
If you would like to get payed in bitcoin... just work and buy bitcoin right? (that's my situation)
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:08:40
Checkmate vegans?
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:36:08
Interesting. Maybe people would spend less and there would be less consuming.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:36:52
Surely it is if they give you an address and you can check that on the blockchain
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:51:45
Wait what? Coinbase doesnt even sell bitcoin cash. I am soo confused i think ill just go with ethereum.
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:48:53
I see, thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:30:11
thank you :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:57:59
I didnt know hardware wallets were simple. Also 60€ for a HWW is a bit too much for my plays 
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:18:13
I'd want to buy so much :(((( but i still cant because of my fucking (obsolete) bank account confirmation
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:26:42
No, coinbase only reqiuires 1 verification

My opinion is: you will regret not holding sooner or later
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:46:36
I'm also non us but coinbase works in europe :)
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:11:52
What's the problem with that?
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:50:35
A miscounted 0 is a 1000% mistake in normal currency too. 1000000$ or 10000000$

Yes they are and yeah it is weird
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:18:30
I'm a newbie. I want to buy during a Dip and hodl! I think i can handle the pressure. Is this a large enough dip? Where should I buy .001 bitcoin?

It would cost me more than i invest ������

I was scrolling the page and i read "Bitcoin value has multiple weaknesses.  Someone could hack the blockchain, create more Bitcoins and manipulate the value or sell the illegitimate Bitcoins and abscond with the buyers’ dollars."

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:25:55
Are there desktop wallets that have this feature?
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:07:36
And is that true or not?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:26:08
Just use gdax geez
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:12:45
What about wallets like  blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:06:36
As soon as your transaction is included in a block it is confirmed. Blocks are made on average Every 10 min. Depending on the FEE that you set for the miner to take, your transaction will be included in the first block or in the second, third...
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:32:40
On a web archive you can find one that gave 50 btc 
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:21:18
Right but not everyone buys gold because it's too expensive.
Wtf is this lol bitcoin is expensive too. And you can buy just how much you can, so there's no "too expensive".
I didn't say bitcoin is better than gold. 
Also i said on the PLANET THERE is a fixed amount of gold, not that right now it isn't being mined. Also bitcoins are being mined as of now
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:30:42
Do we get to "duplicate " our coins?

honest question

I read the answers but i still didnt understand how to get my forked coins

@_date: 2017-09-07 19:24:32
I probably don't understand bitcoin enough to understand what you're saying because I thought bitcoin cash was another blockchain
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:45:06

How much did the average block size increase? 
I may be totally wrong but i've heard that even if segwit was mainly to enable layer 2 it would have still impacted those things

Exactly this is a ponzi scheme!  Sell all (to me) !
Holy shit how are there STILL people saying this is a ponzi. Can't you REALLY do your own research? This is called Deflation, and it's not a reason for collapse. There's only a fixed amount of gold in this planet. So is it a ponzi scheme? How will 7 billion people only have a limited amount of gold? It's gonna collapse! Sell me your gold.

I don't believe anyone when they say they know FOR SURE what the price will be. But you're right, the discount is there for people who were thinking it was too pricey

The only way is to take random guesses. But you're more likely to be eaten by your mouth than to guess a private key.
