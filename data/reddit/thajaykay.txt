Im not worried about .48BTC amount. 
Im worried that its missing. 
Im worried that the company is not transparent. 
Im worried that market orders get executed $5+ outside of the spread. Their limit orders are a joke. Go try :)
Im worried that the "leverage" is not legit in the slightest. 
Im worried that when you place an order on two separate accounts you see the spread reverse between them! 
Im worried NOT because of my "measly" .48BTC...
Im worried because this is FRAUD. 
It used to happen in the FX market astronomically until regulation was put into place and it still exists in many markets. Hopefully the same happens to BTC so it protects us consumers from shit like this.
Not trying to bash you but go open a trade on both sides and then come back here and tell me your experience before you bash me.

Your a fucking retard. Don't even bother responding unless you are going to help answer the accusations that Raphael isn't. Your wasting your time telling me your opinion. I don't care and neither does the rest of the world. Lets deal with facts and the fact is there is no transparency and no response. 
.48BTC is the least of my worries. Is that a lot of bitcoin to you? I can donate your broke ass some if you answer my questions.

Raphael, Im curious as to why you SAY I am the only one trying to bring light to your leverage, platform, and company transparency when there are plenty of other people dealing with bitfinex same bucketshop techniques?
That last one is to help you bring light to yourself.

Mark Karpeles is a fatass nerd. Remember what MTGOX stands for? Capable of being a CEO to a multimillion dollar exchange? Its a fucking card trading platform! Gox will die eventually. Mark my words.

Raphael fails to post any responses to my questions in regards to this exchanges transparency. 
The so called leverage is extremely inaccurate. You may experience 1.5:1 at best on your gaining positions and up to 2.5:1 on your losing positions.
That is simply why I asked people to open up two accounts and post trades on both sides and see what happens. Also take a look at what happens to the spread ;)
Couple that with their tiny volume and their platform that is delayed by up to 30 seconds and you can get an idea of what its like...
I was asking for Raphael to post his algorithm for the world to see but he has yet to do so.
I know plenty about margin trading. Like I have said before this is not uncommon in the forex market still TODAY and it was outrageous when the FX market was expanded and introduced to the speculative investors not too long ago. They were called bucketshops and they still exist today. Mainly out of countries like Cyprus, Virgin Islands etc due to the intense financial regulation we have in the US.
This exchange is no different. Hopefully the NYDFS establishes an auditing requirement for bitcoin exchanges like Ben Lawsky was speaking about during the public hearings on the 29th of Jan.
That would help tighten the grip around companies like Bitfinex.
