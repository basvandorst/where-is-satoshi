Paysafecard is a scam. My first and last experience is bad. They scammed me about  10€, never more, thanks. 
I don't understand, why google support the scam instead of Bitcoin.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoins ��

Ötzi the Climber was found thousands of years after death. Soon or later we will find him.

Yes, that's good. Maybe the best on Android so far. Eclair is nice, but can't receive. Wallet of satoshi has no seed (not your bitcoins) but extremely easy.  Blue wallet is buggy, but looks like solid competitor.

Perhaps nothing listens on port 10009 (RPC). Check it.

3.7e78 bytes = 3700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 Terrabytes . How many TB has your PC?

good, but keep in mind you need almost 2^256 addresses + the same amount of pkeys and it requires "a bit more" storage.
Can you imagine 3.7e78 bytes of data? ����

I think it is simply brute force, because there is no way how to predict a result from one-way function.

check the service locally (localhost and LAN IP usually  192.168.x.x port 8333 )
`netstat -nat`
check OS firewall, 
check router port forwarding
check public IP + port from internet (other network) or some web checker.
come back with results
