You da man. \*fist pound\*

Same. I don't make a lot of money and I'm a little late to the party but ever since the start of 2019 I've been putting a good chunk of any extra money that I have into BTC. Now in August I have more money saved than I've ever had in my entire life and it's almost all in crypto.  
Edit: My only regret is fucking around a little with leverage trading with no experience.  :(

his gains are 1 penny on this so wouldn't the tax on this one trade be like 0?

Lol was thinking the same thing

I can't even comprehend how this would be possible. I heard about a BTC transaction over radio waves recently but even that would require electricity.. like how the hell can you trade crypto without electricity? Please fill me in.

Except 1 BTC isn't $15k anymore.

Greedy. If I became a millionaire because of you even if you didn't necessarily push for me to buy that BTC I would throw you a few thousand at least, maybe buy you a car or something.

It'll definitely be more than $10. I bet my life on it.

looks like you were wrong
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:11:02
Ok bud, got it. "Take off" is 100k.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:17:42
Sounds like a good plan! Thanks!
