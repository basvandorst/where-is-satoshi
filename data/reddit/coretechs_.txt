This smear was one of the the most detrimental hits to Nxt.  I wish Jeff would apologize but I doubt that will ever happen as that was the point.
The Nxt price may be hammered but development is very active.  Coin shuffling is currently being tested on testnet and allows for decentralized anonymous voting among other things.  By all measures it is certainly a much more viable platform than Namecoin, and it's original proof-of-stake model has only been successfully attacked by misinformation.

Hi, this is Daniel Mross, one of the creators of The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.  We know a lot of people have been waiting to see the film, and I hope I can convey to you just how eager we are to get it released as soon as possible. I'm sorry we haven't done a better job with updates.  I'd like to share a few comments that I hope will answer some of the questions that have been asked lately.
For starters, we are planning an online release in some form or another.  I personally believe that in the near future, online distribution will become the norm, and that crypto-currency will be a major part of it, but we're not quite there yet, and we want the film to have the best chance of reaching all audiences around the world.
I've seen a few mentions about crowd-funding, and my guess is that some people are confused.  The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin was not crowd-funded.  We did receive donations that went towards production costs, but they were a very small part of the budget, which was otherwise entirely self-funded.
I know how frustrating it can be to wait for a long time and be completely disappointed at the end, but this isn't bitcoin mining equipment, and we are doing everything we can to make sure you will not be disappointed!  We worked incredibly hard to make the film while keeping up with the blistering pace of the growth in the Bitcoin world.  We were editing the Tribeca cut up to the very last minute before the submission deadline, and still managed to include breaking news events that happened with major characters in the film during the last few days before it.  Since the premier we have been finishing all the remaining work - mastering audio &amp; video, color-correction, animation edits, bug-fixes, etc., everything necessary to deliver the final polished film to a distributor.
We are very excited at the amount of interest in the film, and we have been delighted with all the offers of help we have received from the community.  Thanks for being patient for so long, I promise we will have some very good news to share soon.

You can trade crypto currency within the NXT client/p2p network itself.  No exchange required, no email address required, just a NXT client.

I got an email from the Coinbase compliance team a few weeks ago stating that my account activity was at a level that may place me in the category of a MSB.  It provided a link to the FinCEN regulations and asked a number of questions about whether I am licensed as an MSB, whether I have an AML/BSA policy, etc, and I was given a 7 day window in which to respond.
I responded by answering the questions clearly as possible, and offered to verify any account activity as needed.
They replied that my response was sufficient and thanked me for cooperating with their due diligence process.
FWIW I've never used LocalBitcoins.

Whitepaper - 
Coinshuffle is being implemented in NXT for monetary system coins -

NXT is not a scam.  Source is available in the same link above.
The monetary system allows anyone to create crypto-tokens and trade &amp; exchange them on the NXT blockchain.  Crowdfunding tokens, pre-paid access, proof-of-work mined coins, NXT-backed coins (peg), etc, can all be issued on top of NXT, and some of them will be able to be used with coin shuffle.  The pace of NXT development is impressive, I can only suggest you look beyond your biases.

It was not crowdfunded, you are confusing it with another film.

Psycho-babble?  The term DAC was barely used a year ago because it was largely still a foreign concept to many crypto users.  You can call Bitcoin a DAC too, but instead of users, the shareholders are the miners and the shares are their hashrate.  With proof-of-work, you pay the miners to use the blockchain and they set the fees, with NXT you pay every NXT owner proportionally and the fees are fixed.  It's completely different.  Either way, the shareholder metaphor is besides the point, the technology speaks for itself.

You don't mine NXT tokens so how could you "premine" them?  Your statement is like saying, "Apple stock is a scam because it was 100% premine."  NXT is a DAC.  It is a decentralized public corporation and NXT tokens are shares that you can use to pay for decentralized services that the network provides.  It's short-sighted to compare the NXT distribution to Bitcoin because they are entirely different systems.  And with the NXT monetary system, "fairly" distributed proof-of-work coins with no "premine" are now a *feature* in NXT.

I have to agree.  She seems to have done her homework and appears to have a thorough understanding of blockchain technology applications across the finance industry.
