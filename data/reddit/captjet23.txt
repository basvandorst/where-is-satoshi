My monitor doesn't rotate to portrait easily. Please rotate picture.

Just head to freenode in IRC and join  or  Either one will teach you a decent amount. One is full of neckbeards, the other is full of trolls. It's up to you to decide which you want to join. They taught me a lot, and I wouldn't be where I am without them.

These folks need to call J.G Wentworth.

I can't believe he had the words DONG and SACHS on the screen for so long without connecting the two. I feel like he really had to hold that one back.

I believe they are engaged now. I offered to strip at Sarah's Bachelorette party for Bitcoin but she refused.

As the gentleman in the film notes, it is not paper money, it represents TRUST. Paper money only succeeds so long as the sole issuer holds the trust of its constituency. The U.S. put "In God We Trust" on their paper in order to keep that trust alive. It, too, will fail.

Just buy and accept it. I bought a little when they were $60, but proceeded to format my computer thinking my leftover wasnt worth anything. Didn't get in until they were $1100 on the way down from the spike. I lost $400 in the first two days of the $800 that I spent. Three months later I am doing quite well for myself, having day traded small amounts to the point where I am now up well over my original investment. From what I have learned studying bitcoin, now is the time to buy. We will likely see another order-of-magnitude pump at some point in the next year.

Everyone keeps talking about how bad the name is. Which means everyone is talking about the name. Which means everyone is going to remember this name. 
To the team of Buttercoin, remember this: Your name will not be forgotten. It will stick with everyone who hears it. It is your job to decide in what regard the name will be held.

All of these people saying they want to do away with banks are going to be in for a big surprise when the banks actually crash, and lo and behold there are no more loans to keep the economy going. BTC will be the downfall of our civilization as we know it. From the ashes will rise a mighty empire of freedom and prosperity.

The smallest amount is a Satoshi, though, right?

Fiat is currency like the USD.
