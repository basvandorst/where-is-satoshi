i wanted to write something but im to lazy im probably going to get attacked for that anyway so fuck it...
yeay bitcoin wow  OP bought a lot of coins in december and tries to stay postive buy posting the same fucking thing over and over again...
who knows maybe bitcoin will dumb to 3k and stay like it for another 10years... 
yesterday i just ised the new app our bank provided.
you can send money instantaniously with it. Its just one click and the other end just drags down it reloads ans bam the money is already there...
well bitcoin for the other hand good luck with that, we saw how long it took for a transaction in mid december...
im not really into bitcoin, but projects like Komodo who offer a way better solution those types of Projects get my full attention.
yea i just wrote this on the go so plz dont mind all the grammatical error and such.

got it i was thinking about selling maybe 50% so to say to pay of my rig asap to increase my profit since i dont have to pay electricity ( my father owns a buisness where the rig is standing he shows the  electricity as an buisness fee and can get back the taxes on it) im 21 so i dont worry about retirment yet, but my own car that would be super awesome maybe an ford fiesta st if i can sell my old ford fiesta diesel ( since there is  some serious backlash for diesels in germany atm) 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:11:53

what does this news mean for other crypto dealers like coinbase etc. do we have to fear for our assets.
i would seriously think about moving all my assets from coinbase to binance since i also live in germany where coinbase support is more or less lala...
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:24:21

i have a question about the transaction.
how do you pay with your BTC do you scan a QR code?
- and what does it actually take ypur BTC or the amount of Dollar.-so e.g. if it costs $10 normally would it take the equivalent BTC  at the given time, since BTC value always changes or is it an Set amount of BTC.
