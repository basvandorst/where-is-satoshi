Change the frame of reference to bits. 
Rename milli bits to kilo bits and it all works. Satoshis are the cents.

Try renaming milli bits to kilo bits and using bits as the frame of reference. A bit is made up of 100 satoshies (like cents) and a thousand bits is (obviously) a kilo bit. A whole bitcoin, one million bits would be a megabit. It sits well with peoples understanding of the hierarchy of numbers/money.

I heard the CEO on a podcast. The interest rate is a work in progress as the platform matures. The rate was higher originally (13%) a few months ago and the CEO expected the rates to quickly reduce. The maximum term is 12 months and can be rolled over with the new rates.

Only took a Royal Commission and week’s of public humiliation to realise that they had to own up to this one. Doubtless originally intending not to have to admit it in the Royal Commission but it’s appears to have been pretty thorough if they are starting to admit these events. The secrets left must be clangers!

What’s the implication of using the address twice ie if you are sending a little bit as a test and then the rest once the test is successful? Better to do the test and may be identified than risk an error and send it to an address you don’t control the keys for.

Or use bits as the unit and sats as the cents. Then kilo (mBTC) and Mega (BTC). 
Sort of like how we talk about ounces or grams of gold rather than tonnes.

I agree, but to take it a step further we should rename mbits (ie one thousandth of a bitcoin) to kilobits meaning 1000 bits. Bits would be the base units with Satoshis the hundredths or “cents” of bits. This way we are referencing the bits rather than the whole bitcoin. Whole Bitcoins would then fit into the system as millions of bits (this probably isnt that far away). It all fits together logically in this hierarchy. 
TLDR: rename millibits to kilobits to reference bits

Make bits the base figure and kilobits works (instead of millibits). While BTC is a megabit. Sats are the cents.

We should change frame of reference to bits and rename millibits to kilobits (metric!!). Satoshis will be the cents (hundredths of a bit). A whole bitcoin could be a megabit. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:05:55
Agree,further change frame of reference to bits so 1,000 bits is a kilobit rather than a millibit. 1,000 kilobits would be a megabit (formerly known as a whole bitcoin). A Satoshi is 0.01 bits, similar to cents are to dollars.

Side question, the mempool has been stable at around 4000 unconfirmed (around 1 sat/byte) transactions for a week or so. Why isn’t it clearing completely? It dropped from 200k to 4K consistently (say 10k a day or so), so why can’t it clear to last 4k?

Having 10 BTC ( would be enough to pull the trigger on retirement. First step would be to sell 1 only (10%) to cover a couple of years costs. Expected growth lets you sell another 10% in a year or 2 (0.9 BTC), then in few years another 10 % (0.81 BTC). BTC likely to be worth a lot more 5 years later. Worst outcome is you have 5 years of work and then go get another job.
