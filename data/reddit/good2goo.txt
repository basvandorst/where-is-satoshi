I don't see why a bitcoin wallet paired with a bank couldn't function similarly to a debit card or maybe something like a pre-paid btc cards. You need something backed with "trust" and if I get an approval from a customer with $0 in their bank account the bank will still pay me and later collect from the customer. There are some trade offs in that the bank could limit where you could spend your btc but it wouldn't have to be your primary wallet.

I kinda understand what you're saying but landlord is the term used for someone who owns a space that I want to use, whether to live or use for activities or set up a shop. If we are under some other system, unless I personally own all of the space I want to use I will have to pay some cost to someone for access. It might be there government or it could be an individual but they'd serve the function as a landlord. What system ensures I pay/trade exactly the right cost for this access? If the system says this access is "free," then how does it ensure everyone has access when they need it without waiting longer than they need? What happens if we need more space, what is the force that makes more space available?

If the world's population increases from 7 billion to say 10 billion and the amount of bitcoins stays the same the currency will continue to be a deflationary currency until population growth stops. You need both the currency to stabilize and population growth to stabilize.

I don't understand how bitcoin would ever cease to be a deflationary currency as long as there is population growth.

Socialism is not without its own flaws and it still has a security force. I'd argue there hasn't been one successful example of its utopian vision on a macro level. I believe there are some positive aspects of socialism and better than capitalism in some ways but I'm not convinced it's better overall. The socialist countries I have visited often have lower crime but were in my opinion living at a much lower standard of living. They all had a roof over their heads but no toilet paper. Is that better? To some people maybe. 
There was still a police force. They force you to participate in a socialist society as much as the police force forces us to participate in a capitalist society. Try telling them you want to have your own business, or that you don't want to work for to government and see what happens. They still controlled the flow of information. Minimal access to the internet, not censored but inaccessible for most people and dreadfully slow.
If they want something, no one is entitled to a quantity of anything that exists. There are still costs that limit availability to the few that can afford them. The costs might not be monetary but there are still limiting factors. You still end up with the have and have nots.
There's minimal incentive to anything difficult like becoming a doctor to get paid the same as a garbage collector. Why go to school for 25 years to get paid the same? In a society where everyone is empathetic and altrustic the system should work. I just don't think that society exists.
I'm not against what you're saying but I haven't seen it work on a macro level. Maybe the places I've been haven't been the best examples but it's clear that simply being a socialist society doesn't guarantee a better standard of living.

If I live in a desert it might not be possible for my community to produce enough water for survival. By offering my services as a phone manufacturer I can earn money to trade for the water my community needs. It's also very possible at my community can produce other necessities more efficiently so that even though I might get relatively underpaid compared to another community I could enjoy a similar standard of living because my other needs can be obtained cheaper than the other community can. When someone says low wages isn't necessarily a bad thing, that means there are situations where low wages wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing while at the same time asking for a portion of someone's paycheck might not be one of those situations. 
There are definitely negative attributes of a capitalistic society but at the end of the day I need to get water. I don't believe capitalism is the perfect solution but I have yet to see an alternative strategy has been proven to be universally better. 
e: I am also a little confused at your definition of a corporation. Is this simply the size or reach of a company? Is it any company that has a manager? If we isolate the entire world to a single community, there will still be businesses. Even if that community is self sufficient and only producing what they need there will still be businesses.

There are a lot of really solid "theories" against most economic strategies. There are equally brilliant minds warring against keynesian economics and a laissez-faire strategy. Neither philosophies are an exact science.

I bought around 40 Satoshi and it's now around 125-150 Satoshi. So it's more than tripled in value in relation to Bitcoin and Bitcoin, as you know, has also gone up.
400k doge is around $1,500-$2,000 right now.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:59:58
I just realized yesterday I have doge that I bought for about $500 a year ago. It's now worth $8k. Definitely pretty happy with my return.

I always tried to get into mining but I couldn't stand the heat and the noise. Well and also the companies that sold the mining equipment were so terrible.

Good info but unnecessarily condescending. I do not need to know of every major bank robbery to use the US dollar. You don't know if the guy you're responding to is even invested in btc or if they even have a lot. The dude was just asking a question.

The credit card fee is being added into the cost of goods. If an item costs $10 and 50 were sold to credit card customers and 50 were sold to cash customers the cost for the items would be 50* $10.30 + 50 * $10 or $1015.00 total. 
Instead of setting up different prices most businesses will just charge everyone $10.15. Credit card customers pay a little less than they should and cash customers pay a little more. In the case where a business offers a discount to cash customers they will set the price at $10.30 and offer a $0.30 cent discount to cash customers.
Even if a company might be allowed to offer a discount for cash customers they may still opt to simply charge everyone $10.15. Most people will not see an incremental difference in price but it's not free as usually everyone is paying for it even though it doesn't show up as a line item.

Exactly. The same thing happens if you have $20 in your wallet and someone robs you but people still use cash. You need to decide if the value of the protection outweighs the value bitcoin offers. Bitcoin faces a lot of obstacles to become easier and secure to use but that could easily come over time. 
Why couldn't a company start issuing debit cards backed by bitcoin and charge vendors a slight fee to accept their cards in exchange for fraud protections? It would be the same thing.

While you are correct, I'm not sure mobileswede is a bitcoin bank manager.

Now where is the article explaining why they have or need secret emergency numbers. How can it be an emergency number if no one knows it? If I know one of these numbers and there is a massive crisis that is clogging up 911 would one of these numbers get me to the "front of the line?"
