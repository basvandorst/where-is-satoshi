Meet at the bank or do nothing.

Not backing up is like not using protection.
You're  gonna get screwed.

I thought he was found dead?
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:09:32
You are not well versed, are you?
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:32:30
I appreciate the knowledge here. So, basically it's taking a while to earn a full bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-25 02:42:51
After reading this, it is classified under 'business interests'.
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:39:27
I like you. Keep this up.

Not arguimg that it matters at ALL.
I am asking for a definition of "Bitcoin Days Destroyed".
Reword your reply please

My brain couldn't  process "insidents" unless i read it as "in-sid-ents"
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:18:27
But I am an asshole with no 'legal authority', a wide range of legal knowledge and experience, grom both sides of the bench. A few times, I fired my representative while he/she was giving a statement or asking questions.
I represented myself. Lost once.
But I will not stand for someone not giving it their all. Incompetance and laziness bug me.

Your mother before I left this morning.

I have a tmobile concord zte, still learning how to record. Wanna help me? I'll do this for the lulz of everyone!

I am asking for a definition of bitcoin days destroyed.
It registers as we lose things. Not that there is trade. 
I do understand that trade is measured in that vocabulary however.
You say destroyed. Bitcoin days destroyed. You've expressed how you get the amount. Now tell me the significance behind it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:10:47
Well, maybe you need introduced to phrases like "slipping through the cracks".
Honestly coinbase agitated me as well and I fully believe that if you target the small numbers, you get big results.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:44:48
Yeah, she kept asking me to pour it on her snatch... i was a bit freaked out.
@_date: 2013-12-12 08:16:32
Yay for the only serious reply.
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:06:40
I won't  mention your name at all. Or account.
I will mention that I have a number of clients complaining about getting threatening letters and advising the bank to cease and desist unless they wish to deal with criminal charges in federal court.

This happens a lot to bitcoin sites

This counts as bullying. Terrorism maybe? A few other legal fractures as well.
I've saved the picture and intend to call them up in the morning.
I.honestly love fighting harassment.
Which is what they're  doing while forcing you to spend your money your way. Sue.
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:47:18
I wonder how people expect this to happpen over 21m bitcoins.
Edit: Sure. Downvote the guy wary of losing what little money he has.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:18:50
Not rooted. Going to check for update.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:43:57
When you saw it start, it's literally shady as fuck. Screams oonzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:01:01
I can't.
Only own a smartphone. Getting up from homelessness and hoping bitcoin will help.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:30:18
Thanks cab00se.
