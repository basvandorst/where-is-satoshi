You're suffering from serious FOMO and I get it, I am too. But just chill man. There's no point stressing. Invest what you can afford when you can afford it and don't put yourself in a vulnerable position financially.

Sorry to hear that! Just try and work your way up to 1 or more over time. I'd love a whole one but I kept putting it off and all I have now is a bunch of alts ��. It's a bit of fun though and I'm happy to hodl. You don't need to do anything, it's easy ��

I think the way you said it implies a huge investment and that you're able to splash the cash whereas they may not be able to. Comes across a bit arrogant.
