But you're not buying any bitcoin to buy litecoin, for example. It means people are selling off their crypto all together. The conversions shouldn't have any effect, no?

Ok there, Scrooge McDuck, with your money room and shit.

I mean, I was just trying to make a funny. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:54:16
Eh, it's just greed. A finance course doesn't cure that.

By technicality, a councilor represents an entire area of people, it's not just one person. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:42:08
Oh my god, thank you! This was driving me crazy, and now I feel especially dumb for not even checking how accurate that number was haha

Eh, why doesn't it somewhat equal it? He's a councillor, therefore a representative of a lot of Torontonians, and will be putting it on the docket for a future council meeting. I'd say that's somewhat of a Toronto proposal. I don't really understand what's in it for the city except for using the publicity as advertising for being technologically progressive.
And isn't all this adoption by companies accepting bitcoin as payment bad for bitcoin? I assume they all receive payment in bitcoin and sell it immediately to get cash, lowering the price of bitcoin.

Seems to me that the government just wants to get their tax money. Once there's transparency from exchanges, and the government is assured theirs, crypto will boom.

Eh, are paper books still relevant?
I'm still in the group that would prefer read a physical newspaper than stare at a screen. It's just too bad getting The Globe is out of my budget. It's a great paper.

Can they do this without telling you? I mean, unless they tell you by sending an email...

I love this wedding idea. "Babe, we'll put $2000 into bitcoin for a wedding in 2 years. Either we have the most lavish wedding, or we're going to the courthouse. Let the traders decide"

Don't make fun of me, but why am I getting $64.32?
Edit: OK, I did it a different way and ended up with what you got. I've been out of school way too long, but what am i missing in the first two equations? I obviously need a refresher..
.09 x 11825.80 = 1064.32 ---&gt; 1064.32-1000= 64.32
11825.8 - 11226.67 = 599.13 ---&gt; 599.13 x .09 = 53.92
(11825.8 - 11226.67) / 11226.67 = .0533666 ----&gt; .0533666 x 1000 = 53.3666

It's scary the news sources that get upvoted to the front page of this sub. It makes us all look like idiots. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:38:11
You realize that's an op ed, right? Papers routinely have them arguing both sides. Doesn't mean it's the stance of the entire organization. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:26:52
Dude just got robbed. Why be a dick? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:11:09
Well, I mean, it does seem those are the two governments threatening to make crypto trading illegal.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:27:10
Sorry, your comment confuses me a bit. Could you please explain?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:33:16
I just looked at an atm in my area, and the spread I can buy at vs sell at is $2500. Isn't that crazy and a huge rip off? Is this normal? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:13:26
But those things do still happen with humans regardless of law. We outlaw them because society might have trouble functioning if we didn't. Also in your scenario the victims are humans. Humans eating meat, the victims are animals.

The person being lent the bitcoin (shorter) cashes it out and has to replace the bitcoin in the future hoping the price falls and can replace it for almost nothing. Thus netting the price he sold it for minus replacement cost and interest paid for being lent the bitcoin.

As someone who has no idea, if it's not accessible, then what's the point of increasing the money supply? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:14:43
Anyone that doesn't own any will want it to fail. If they bought some, they'd generally be barking different outcomes. It's interesting how bitter people can be about others' success. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:48:39
If you're selling for a loss whenever it dips, obviously this is money you're afraid to lose. Buy less and just hold it in the future.

So he's basically a martyr. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:11:15
It's really a genius move... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:59:11
Can someone explain? Is it really possible that one person could hold upwards of 10% of all bitcoin right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:41:26
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:37:05
Really? I think some people, like me, just really believe in it. Like OP says, millennials are pissed off. Bitcoin is hope. 
If the ship is going down, I'm going with it.

I would also like 1 BTC. Only need a top up of ~ 0.9. Nothin much. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:33:19
If I want to send my btc to a paper wallet, would it be cheaper to send from coinbase ---&gt;  gdax ---&gt; paper wallet? I assume it's the same as what you just said?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:50:57
How come the value of the USD hasn't plummeted?
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:13:20
But... For people buying $5 it's like buying a novelty coin. They want to be part of the experience and it's fun to hold. Pretty sure they don't plan on selling it tomorrow for a gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:39:39
Probably a very dumb question, but does my btc have to be on an exchange during a fork so i get some of the new currency? Or if i have it in cold storage and move it to an exchange later, will I be "credited" it?
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:21:11
So what happens? Are they gone forever? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:22:25
He's a little biased, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:14:15
Isn't the catch 22 of this that we spend bitcoin at these retailers, who may quickly sell it for fiat, and help drive the price of bitcoin down as we create more sellers in the market? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:10:40
Is it available in Canada? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:30:35
Chill out
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:02
As a complete noob, does it matter if I'm just playing with like $200? Is it worth it? How likely is it something will happen if it's in my coinbase wallet? Once again, 100% noobie.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:29:12
No chance I was watching it, but did he actually do it or is everyone screwing around? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:54:27
Why do you say that? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:24:43
Wait, so is it basic math or not? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:05
Not a chance. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:46:09
What was the context it was brought up? Link's not working for me right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:20:34
If it does, it won't stay high just because it was mentioned. May just see some slight volatility I'd assume.
