Those people will cry themselves to sleep now because of this
@_date: 2014-01-19 20:37:24
I've pondered about that aswel. Quite funny to think about really, imagine if it was true ^^
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:45:00
I don't think you understand the message
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:27:11
This happened to me. Lost 1 bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-06 12:26:08
How the hell do you compare this with all the other products that are thrown out every day? It's all someone elses work to some point.
Nothing lasts, but nothing is lost!
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:48:36
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:26:06
I know
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:59:04
and then multiply the few minutes of joy with all the people who are watching it and feeling the same way!
It's a huge difference!
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:52:37
For some people, it is their computer

It's not about destroying wealth. 
It's about sending a statement, through destrying a comepletely unsignificant amount of wealth. (it's just 5 phones!)
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:43:55
You don't know what kind of effect this campaign will end up having. So how can you state that it is far better than destroying it? 
You don't know the outcome of this. It's an experiment, and the alternative is 5 sad consumers turning into 5 "happy" consumers with new iphones
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:14:30
But you have no idea what amount of "wealth" this campaign can end up having in the long. No ifs ands or buts.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:22:30
this is fucking brilliant
@_date: 2014-02-06 13:25:56
I wasn't asking for "reasonable alternatives" because I am sure there are plenty.
I asked why it was faulty to carry out what he did.
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:21:58
Haha I didn't think about that!
Where I am from no one got guns other than the police/army/gangs.
Ofcourse this whole question will vary alot from country to country.
@_date: 2014-02-06 12:27:30
My bet is that there is enough phones for everyone already.
Those who dont have any either can't aford them, or wont buy them.
@_date: 2016-06-07 19:40:39
Boaty Mc Boatface!
@_date: 2016-06-23 10:00:30
Why has everyone switched from using the term "hold" and instead says hodl? Is this some insider thing? 
I am not with.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:40:32
So what if I trust coinbase more than myself to protect my holdings? The only time I ever tried storing bitcoin on a regular wallet I lost a full bitcoin somehow.
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:15:45
Who the hell knows what they are doing when it comes to selling or buying at the right times anyway?
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:13:25
I lost my bitcoin in their old legacy wallet due to having been inactive for a long time and getting lost inbetween all the new weird informations that they suddently required from me.
After 2 weeks of correspondance with their support I was finally getting my e-mail reset and thought I was going to see my coin but then as I log in the account required me to type in a so called "Second password" which was the wall for me.
I can certainly not reccommend them as a safe site, as I believe all their security meassures might just end up being the reason you lose your coins.
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:04:05
I can't reccommend it! I lost by 1.5 bitcoins with them because they I had an old "legacy" account and somehow it wasn't able to convert to their new wallet properly.
@_date: 2016-12-23 10:07:03
I've done the same but I no longer have access to my account after they upgraded from legacy to their new account systems. Had to reset my 2-factor authentication and e-mail to get access and after all that the account required me to enter a so called "second password" which I have never heard of and without it there is no way to enter my funds. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 16:36:52
No I've been having a long correspondance with their support and they said in the end that this "second password" is incrypted or something like that so there is nothing they can do to about it.
It just doesn't make any sence since when I last logged in a year ago or something like that it was just fine
@_date: 2015-11-01 21:10:43
Check this out!
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:48:41
So much jerk!
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:02:32
Well, nothing. I still need to type in a so called second password to enter the account. Something of which I have never made or accepted
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:11:05
Where is the dollar pitchfork? :(

I don't understand. What does multibit have to do with the blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:25:14
You reccomend another site?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:52:02
Im getting the same when I try to reach their site.
@_date: 2013-12-01 09:22:05
I've been storing coins safely on Mt.gox since I bought in april. As soon as I moved a bitcoin to my Multibit-wallet it was lost in a matter of minutes. 
I think for people who don't understand all this incryption/programming stuff its much safer to keep them online.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:01:58
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:08:07
No, ordinary pc with windows 8
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:48:49
Well since the account is registered in my name, he wont be able to verify it with his id's?
That was my initial thought atleast
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:07:49
Its located in US but US citizens cant buy bitcoins there?
Or did I get something wrong.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:37:32


How do you manage to search files like that on Photorec?
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:42:49
Do I have to be verified to complete this, because I simply cant find this "Receive" option.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:52:30
I'm sure someone can spare 1 minute of their time and explain this in a few words?
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:11:27
Anyone know more about this?
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:28:02
I am just a big noob who downloaded multibit-client, opened a wallet and send 1 bitcoin to it. I did pw protect the wallet though, but I haven't done any of the other stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:16:17
Thank you very much kind sir for making peace to my frustrated mind!
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:07:22
Exciting! Indeed
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:02:58
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:45:43
I can't export any private keys since there is no wallet inside the program to export them from.
This is confusing me
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:12:12
Underpantsgnomes! Effective little bastards, they truly know how to do business
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:23:15
I would like to know more about this Coinsetter site. Do people think it will be  great for bitcoin trading?
