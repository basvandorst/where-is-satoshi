Don't listen to this guy - he is a know-it-all who comes off as a jerk through most of his 4 month old post history. Coinbase is fine for first purchasing bitcoin. Take the time to learn more and, after your first few Coinbase bitcoin purchases, look into moving it from Coinbase to a hardware wallet solution. Trezor and Ledger are great hardware wallets and have been previously mentioned.

I agree. The director says he was going for realistic but there is nothing realistic about it. It is made for teens to feel like they're watching something edgy.

“You” haven’t single-handedly pointed those things out. They are well known facts for those that have spent time learning about Bitcoin, let alone on this sub. Those are stories - OLD stories by the way - that have been published across the crypto journalism world and made there way to the front page of this sub hundreds of times. That’s not the issue. I can agree that coinbase is not a good place - a bad one actually - to keep your coins, but so does almost everyone else here. “Not your keys, not your coins” is common here. But you are too harsh towards newcomers. CB is a good learning platform and how many of those on this sub started. As they grow in their knowledge and understanding of btc, they’ll hopefully make the right decision to obtain a hardware wallet.

If you cash out and profit, you have to pay taxes on those gains. Same rules as any other investments such as stocks. Pay your taxes and you're fine. The people in trouble are guilty of tax evasion. The IRS letters meant nothing to the law-following individuals.

Sure I can. If he holds, btc will eventually double, triple, quadruple etc from where it is now. Thus doubling, tripling, etc his $100. If he holds. Which he should.

Don’t worry. It takes a few business days for the funds to clear your bank. Rest assured, you’ve bought at the stated price and will be able to transfer to cb pro in a couple days. The option to withdraw from coinbase will become available on pro then.

He proved he was the owner of the original 70 and everyone here looked in the other direction because it wasn’t what they wanted to hear. That’s why you haven’t heard about it.

Robinhood crashed too. I recommend you get out of the crypto space - it is not for you. You can deposit money into a real backend exchange like Gemini or Coinbase Pro (formerly GDAX) and pay no fees creating limit orders. You can learn to do this and hold. Otherwise, highly recommend you get out of the space for now.

The MSM will eventually spread FOMO, but the longer we go without it, the better. Last time MSM FOMO was around 10k. This tome, let’s hope it’s a lot higher. And the cycle repeats.

Admittedly it is impossible to admit there is a trend with bitcoin despite what people say. But I’ve been in this for a very long time. And if you hodl, your return will be more worthwhile than you can imagine.

You don't actually own your own bitcoin with Cash app.
