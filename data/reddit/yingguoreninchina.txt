Should have a Bitcoin Black Friday - i.e encourage ppl to spend bitcoins that day in order to show the consumption power of the bitcoin community, generate media coverage and get retailers interested in accepting bitcoin. If everyone spent 1% of their holdings it would be one of the biggest shopping days in history.

This is a short paper I wrote on one way to go about thinking about bitcoin's value. The very finger in the air assumptions I made lead to an appropriate valuation today for $3,554, and a maximum theoretical value of $81,444.
Obviously, the link between fundamental value, and how the market actually prices bitcoin today, is extremely complex and therefore it is almost impossible to predict what will happen.

Well thank you for reading! The point of the framework isn't to say what the value of bitcoin should be, but to give a rigourous means to determine what it would mathematically need to be in order to facilitate the level of transactions in a given scenario. What i think it at least shows is that an even moderately hopeful view of bitcoin's future implies a significantly higher valuation, while at the same time demonstrating that the very high potential valuations sometimes mentioned of 100k+ are very difficult to justify

I don't think I would change my assumptions much from before to be honest, which resulted in a value of $3,500. Certainly the current value of ~$300 implies a very high 95%+ likelihood of bitcoin failing, which seems overly pessimistic to me. If bitcoin is even remotely successful the value would need to be much higher simply to facilitate the level of transactions

Firstly, thank you for reading the article! I gave a nod to the fact that bitcoin velocity could exceed that of the USD in the upside scenario, though only 10 vs 7 as a high level assumption. You may well be right that it could be a lot higher, in which case the implied value per bitcoin would be lower. I think powers of magnitude higher is unlikely though. Today there is about $7,000 of M1 per person in the US. I don't see why the average should be significantly lower for bitcoin. It would require much better asset allocation into real assets than is the case at present, which to my mind is more a function of the quality of the banking system, education on investment etc.

Very good - this is the first time I’ve seen something like this but really stats like this should be the focus of discussion. There is inevitably a high degree of uncertainty in some of this data, but it is still very useful to see a sensible attempt to distill the various snippets of information out there into something coherent. For me the one I’d really love to see some in depth research on is daily spend on goods and services, as this is ultimately what matters. $3m is still incredibly tiny and really needs to increase to make btc viable in the long run (I’m not a big believer in btc being a store of value like gold or real estate, at least not unless backed up with serious levels of real world adoption).
