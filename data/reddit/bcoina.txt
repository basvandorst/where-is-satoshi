Far, far from it. He refused to reveal the *"findings"* that they were *"100% confident"* in. Then attempted blackmail.

Refusing to even tell them what the issue was until they committed to giving him $75k is pretty bad.
Not sure how one can be *"100% confident"* and still hold back like that, not wishing to have their *"finding"* examined before being handed cash.

Honestly LN is ill-suited to this tipping thing. Like with other tip bots it becomes a custodial middleman when any funds are held.
If it could generate invoices on behalf of the recipient and enable a truely P2P transaction that'd be something. With itself as a middle-man it's kind of just smoke and mirrors.
It'd be great if tipping were a good demonstration of the network, but it ain't. That's why no one bothered sooner

How does it follow that "not wanting people to remove crypto" is *directly* attributable to "proof of keys"?
Could that not simply be someone taking credit where no credit is due? Could that also be a reasonable answer?


Not relevant to the point I'm making. I've had multiple people discard this as simply HitBTC paid shilling or attributing everything to some kind of association or bias towards them. I have zero vested interest in this exchange either up or down.


No one is required to invent a reason for why HitBTC might be doing anything they do. The world can exist without having a narrative applied as a layer on top of it.

You won't find it. Too contentious.
That and at some point we'll only have to in some way increase block size again anyway, so it's best left alone.
Just as transaction costs blew out during the bullrun, so node running costs may at some point (I already can't download blockchain on available bandwidth, I'm aware). However they'll come back into line again as things go on. In my example another 6 months I'll have the bandwidth needed when fibre is installed locally.
