Sounds like you're just coming up with this stuff, all signs point to CIA having some of the least impressive "cyber" capabilities in the US IC.

Someone with far more clout than me has already spent their time on writing about this, so I'll just refer you to [his posts](
Suggesting that "responsible disclosure" wasn't coined by software vendors in a deliberate effort to defame security researchers is just a straight up lie.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:20:23
Should they just not have looked at all then and left the bugs there?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:36:24
There's simply no such consensus established in this field.
People who talk about "responsible disclosure" and argue that full disclosure is unethical tend to have never worked in the field.

This simply isn't true, you're coming up with your own terms here.


You have zero experience in this field, there are no "professional standards" against full disclosure.

Is it reeaally selfish to want compensation for your work?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:25:28
but why? neither ledger nor trezor is paying them.

Of course they can't ask these companies for payments, that could open them up to significant legal liability.
If its unethical to sell exploits to LE is it unethical to sell clothes to LE? 
Indiscriminately selling exploits to the highest bidder could very well be criminal if the buyer reveals their illegal intentions to you, but the well paying customers are not criminals.

You’re the one who’s been arguing strawmen.

Only people pushing for "responsible disclosure" are software vendors, not people actually working in vuln research.
This term was coined by software vendors in an effort to defame security researchers for exposing issues in their products.
You have to remember that these researchers are not creating vulnerabilities, the vendors are.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:19:24
Why should security researchers not be allowed to do anything they want with their work product?
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:24:22
If you actually have years of experience in vuln research industry you'll know that "Unprofessional dickbags for not responsibly disclosing" is an opinion held by an extraordinarily small minority of the people actually working in the field.
Of course sysadmins and glorified sysadmins tend to be upset by full disclosure.
