Thanks, man! I think I'm right though. According to [this]( page, Credit/Debit Cards are the only supported payment methods in Australia. And [this]( page only provides instructions for Credit/Debit cards.

Oh, I've only linked my debit card (which is linked to my bank account). Would directly linking my BSB and account number help?

Yep, I see that. But for me, when I click it, it simply goes to  [shows me my debit card limit]( and doesn't allow me to add anything further.

Thanks for that. Unfortunately when I select Add Payment Method, the only option is a Credit/Debit Card. I've alreadu used my debit card linked to my bank account, and to verify, Coinbase sent me two small payments.
Perhaps Australia has limits?

This makes me cringe. Logically, hindsight is 20/20, but fuck...

I've Googled and read the basic parts of websites, and from what I've read, I thought my limit would be higher. Since posting this thread, I think it's an Australian thing that has "lower limits".
