You wont get Fiat for blacklisted Wallets because Exchanges wont let you. One tiny failure and Police will stand in your door. Chinas governments can dictate Inland Pools what to do, they can Blacklist Wallets evectivly. They can make your live very hard. No one wants tainted coins, you can Transfer your coins but only with big Problems and big Problems cost extra Money.
Wallet seized or Not, If they know it is your Wallet or know your involved, your live will be hard

bitcoin is no solution to the problem you stated.
china controls bitcoin. because 80% of the hashrates come from there, and also it is traceable so all governments can easily seize bitcoins; so no security there. and since the biggest hashrate (china) is in control, they can inflate it

i guess all you do is working for yourself not realising you dont live alone

"accumulated work" consists of two things: accumulation and work.
it is more importand what kind of work is accumulated. and government backed work is more reliable.
also: it is not important that cars can drive, it is important that we can use it. bitcoin-technology doesnt matter if we wont use it

gold did not perform since 10 years and it is not expected to perform ever. just a constant store of value
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:48:32
who cares of most accumulated work? it is just a protocol definition
if a currencys only usecase is to replace government-backed currency, then it also needs to be government-backed, because governments have the power to protect from loss. and no one likes losses..

reading through your comments from the last 24h, you could write a whole book. you seem to be the one without a job sitting all day on couch texting paranoid bullshit

they dont want to get rid of it. what does that actualy mean?
they want to enhance it
they dont want a new value, they want a new system/network

maybe a temporary solution. but EVERY transaction is traceable, doesnt matter if they trace 1 or 1mio transactions.
