Meh, there are plenty of "multi-million dollar VC startups" that have a stupid business and end up folding later on. Just because someone/some company gets millions in VC funding does not mean they are infallible. But yes, in all likelihood they and the investors who gave them the millions of dollars probably have more of the bases covered and have thought of all the caveats that a random redditor could come up with.

A million times this. Nobody in Japan is using BTC for transactions. On any forum or any exchange with chat features, all people are talking about is making money. The way they make money is by buying BTC because it's been going up so much. That's why there has been a premium on Japanese exchanges (not sure about Korea).
This is different from "HODL" because they are simply saying "it's dumb to short BTC, it only goes up" or "buy now and you'll have double your money by xmas" etc. They are often calling it "bonus" money likening it to their company bonuses. When it comes tumbling down, it's going to tumble hard.

There are plenty of altcoins that have plenty of miners doing plenty of commerce. Sure, Bitcoin is on top now but what makes you so confident that it will be forever? Especially when there are "second generation" altcoins being developed now that are not based on Bitcoin source at all that could potentially offer many new innovations that BTC can't or won't implement.

Bitcoin most definitely will not be a huge success. It may see a period of growth and major adoption, but Bitcoin itself is flawed and will not be the cryptocurrency that is used by the masses.
Cryptocurrency IS revolutionary, and it will be used all over the world in a few years' time. However, it won't be Bitcoin. There are just too many fundamental problems with it. There are plenty of new cryptocurrencies on the horizon (so-called "next-gen" cryptocurrencies) that solve many of these issues. One or several of them may be used by the masses in the future (or one that is still yet to be developed), but it will not be Bitcoin unless a complete overhaul of the core protocol is made.

For me, the biggest one is the 51% attack vulnerability. That is the biggest flaw with the way Bitcoin works and I don't know of any real solution to it as long as Proof of Work is used. (This is why most next-gen cryptocurrencies do not use any PoW at all.)
The second is that Bitcoin is deflationary. Everyone thinks this is a great thing, but rampant deflation is never going to work for a currency. This is basic economics. A fixed money supply simply cannot work for a currency and therefore Bitcoin is treated more like a speculative asset. This is fine, but it means that Bitcoin will never be used for what it is intended to be used for (on any large scale at least).
Then there are transaction times, blockchain bloat, etc. and the lack of many other features that make other next-gen cryptocurrencies much more palatable to the average user. These issues can be worked around, which is why I list them last, but something still needs to be done about them.
Anyway, with that said... I still have some Bitcoin (I've been in BTC since 2010), but I am mostly completely divested from it and have moved on to more promising next-gen cryptocurrencies. I will still hold some BTC, because with enough development work it could still survive, and it has the advantage of being first to market, but I think it will be ultimately usurped by a newer, better, easier to use technology.

I've lived in Japan since 2004 and, maybe it's different in Tokyo, but I don't see anything you apparently have seen in Japan.
Japanese people still by far primarily use cash. Many, many Japanese people don't even have a computer at home and the vast majority are what you would generally consider computer illiterate.
Transit passes and "e-money cards" are nothing like Bitcoin at all. They are basically debit cards, which the West has had since the 90s and Japan still doesn't commonly use.
I mean, our ATMs even close for holidays and Internet banking is only recently starting to gain any traction at all here.
I'm sorry but I don't see Japan picking up on Bitcoin anytime soon and I'm not nearly as optimistic as you are about them being able to understand it "quicker than any other country in the West".
I mean, come on... Japan is still clinging to FAX machines.

I think most places in America do not allow you to buy first and pay later because I assume many Americans abused it and bought the item and then just simply refused to pay later. Having lived in America for a good portion of my life, this just seems like something Americans would do.
However, here in Japan as well it is still very common to buy first then pay later either by cash on delivery, at a convenience store, or bank transfer.

Yeah, it's an old debunked study (and the only one you can find that actually states such a finding) that every transphobe loves to use as a smoking gun that their hatred of trans people is justified.

Do you agree that it is bigotry to think that homosexuality is a choice? Do you agree that treatments such as conversion therapy are morally wrong?
If you agree, not so many years ago people would have said the same thing as you're saying about trans people now.
To say that Caitlyn Jenner is not a woman is to deny her existence as a human being in her mind. It's cruel and harmful to her and is what leads trans people to commit suicide.
Let's just assume that it is all a mental illness, and that all trans people are just playing pretend. Are you so selfish that you would deny them some semblance of a normal life by allowing them to transition? Are you somehow hurt or damaged by referring to Caitlyn Jenner as a woman? Then what is the issue? You'd rather hurt an innocent woman rather than compromise your apparently extremely important allegiance to biology?
I just don't get it... Conversion therapy doesn't work. Never has, never will. The only solution is transitioning for the vast majority of people who are transgender. Just be a decent human being and respect that, that's all anyone is asking.

99% conviction rate is because most Japanese people end up signing a confession through various coercion tactics. Depends on how stupid Mark is, really. He was only arrested which means he will be on holding for a while (up to 3 weeks or so) and they will try various shady ways of coercing a confession out of him. If they can't, he very well may go free if they can't get enough blatantly clear evidence against him.

Nope. It's all basically low-level torture to extract a confession. That's how they maintain their 99% conviction rate. Notice how he's talking now that he is in custody. This is what almost always happens. 99% conviction rate means that nearly everyone they bring in like this signs papers confessing to the crime. If you do not confess and they do not have 100% failproof evidence against you, they will not even take the case to court in most cases.

Sure, all financial instruments have bubbles and crashes. But there is a difference between a crash of the USD or other currencies (which we have seen in the past few years) and the crash of a thinly traded commodity like Bitcoin. Lots of currencies have "lost" 50% or more of their value relative to other currencies in the past 5 years, but it took years for such a crash to develop whereas Bitcoin crashed more than 50% overnight. That's because of how thinly traded it is. I never said it would prevent Bitcoin from ever crashing or growing into a bubble again, but a 50% drop in value spread over a year or more is drastically different from a 50% drop overnight. In the real world, big businesses have currency hedges to help them out when a currency drops in value, and that's because they can forecast these trends since they develop over a much longer period of time. That's the advantage of having a larger market with more players in it.

At the risk of this becoming a gender debate... Do you really think these are inherent traits or are they because of society pushing roles onto people.
As I sit here and read this you say "men engage in risk-taking behavior". Does it make me a man because I trade Bitcoin? Men being "the expendable gender" no longer holds any clout in modern society. It's not like you guys are going out and hunting a sabretooth tiger for dinner you know.
Making money and risk-taking are only "typically masculine" behavior because men have oppressed women for the past thousands of years.
As for your final statement about women holding the most power in society well... I could sit here and type out an entire book about why and how that is false but it probably wouldn't change your mind because you obviously already have your ideas about gender roles set firmly in concrete.
Furthermore, in Japan (the country where I live), it is *extremely* common for many housewives to trade stocks or currencies at home for supplemental income... and gambling halls are always quite bustling with female activity. Perhaps your oh-so-obvious "truths" about the genders only hold weight when talked about in the context of your particular society. Of course, this means they are not actually gender-related but are actually probably caused by socioeconomic and other external factors.

If you can't understand this, perhaps your problem is not in misunderstanding Bitcoin, it's that you don't know the basics of investing. Do some research, there is plenty of information out there.
I will give you a brief overview though. Bitcoin is still a VERY thinly traded market. At its peak it only had a market cap of a little over $2 billion. That's pennies in investor land. It literally is the market cap of "penny stocks". That means it is very thinly traded. Thinly traded means huge moves. The reason "real" currencies don't have such wild swings all the time is because it is the world's LARGEST market (Wikipedia: According to the 2010 Triennial Central Bank Survey, coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements, average daily turnover was US$3.98 trillion in April 2010). The more money there is in the market, the harder it is to move it. As of right now, any rich investor with a few million dollars can pump (or dump) the price of Bitcoin by huge percentages. As the market grows, it will become harder and harder to do that because there is more money in the way which creates more resistance.

I sense a bit of an animosity towards women here, and honestly the constant badgering about how women are all gold-diggers who will leave their SO as soon as the money dries up is downright offensive to me.
Women who can't think about anything other than money (especially their partner's money) are bitches and have the IQ of a retard at best. The same goes for men.
Anyway, obviously you have no intention of changing the way you think about women as you somehow are validating the systematic oppression of women for thousands of years because women are gold-diggers and bitches so I'll leave it here.
Oh yeah, and also "excessive men" makes it sound like the only goal for any and all humans born is to be paired up with the opposite gender. I know that when I am looking for a man, I always think to myself "hey, there is an excess of men so I should probably dump this guy for someone better-looking and richer when he comes along"... *rolls eyes*

As someone who had and spent 400 BTC over the past couple of years before this recent explosion in price, I don't regret anything. I was doing my part to help make this economy a real one, and honestly being an ultra-rich bitcoin hoarder is not going to make me any happier than I am to see this project succeed in the end for the benefit of all humankind. Now I'm buying a few BTC for the long-term, because it is pretty clear that bitcoin is going to be around for a while. I will still continue to use them (I spent 3.5 on some hardware just recently), but I'm also keeping a couple around for savings.

Bitcoin is still basically completely unknown here in Japan, so props to China for getting in on this in what are still the early days.

No, the general public just does not have the mental capacity to understand it right away, which is why it is a global currency that only has the market cap of a single medium-sized company in America now. 
Go on YouTube and look for clips about the Internet in the early 90s on the news or talk shows or anything in popular media back then. It's full of people dismissing the importance of the Internet, asking how it could possibly be anything that would catch on and be mainstream, underestimating the impact of e-mail and a global system of sharing information for free between all people of the world on a personal one-on-one basis and how it would actually in turn from within itself spawn a further revolutionary innovation in how the human species will evolve to the next level in the form of a global, peer-to-peer, secure, open source currency under the rule of no single entity *because the general population is too busy using the Internet to for the sole purpose of watching Ultra Fail VINE COmPILaTION  and shouting WORRRRRLDDDSTAAHHHHH at backyard fight streams in high-definition, washing all that down with a night full of reality TV that he had set up to be illegally downloaded and organized automatically just as well as his DVR that he threw out last month because he decided he didn't need to pay for cable anymore*.

SealsWithClubs uses Cloudflare and they've been down for 2 days now due to a DDOS. They are apparently moving to a better datacenter, but obviously Cloudflare is not perfect.

Stay away from UFJ too. They are just bad in general. (I bank with them and want to change but I'm too lazy.)

Highly unlikely in Japan. It would be pretty unprecedented.

$10k a week in sales sounds impressive but I'm sure you are not profiting that much on that amount, especially since that only equates to about 5 or 6 units in sales. Decent for a hobby I guess.

Nobody ever said there weren't ANY huge bars around. I just said that bars are like that in Asia. There are literally thousands upon thousands of bars in my city of Nagoya, and it's not even nearly as large as Tokyo or Osaka. There are plenty of bars and clubs here (I might even say the majority, but I haven't actually been to all of them to truly know that) that look just like the one in OP's photos.

Do you think women are incapable of understanding and using Bitcoin?

Just another reason why Worldcoin is superior with 30 second confirmations.

Am I the only person here who thinks saying "the woman" is kind of offensive?
@_date: 2013-10-20 23:00:01
I am! I've been here for about 10 years now. :)

I'm a girl and I've been following bitcoin since it was around $0.70. We exist.

Well, see, it's silly because obviously you were intending it as if he were a dog as a play on his name "Snoop Dogg" but the thing is that calling black people "boy" is considered extremely racist because it's like they are your slave and you are the slave master. It has a history and that is the reason why people are saying you are being racist.
The thing is, you didn't mean it that way obviously and I'm sure even Snoop himself would not give a fuck about it and it's just a bunch of redditors being holier than thous trying to sound like they are champions of social justice.

I'm a girl who has been known to camwhore for free just because I like doing it. I don't see anything wrong with girls (or guys) earning some extra BTC if they want to get nude on the Internet. I don't get why the subreddit was banned in the first place.
