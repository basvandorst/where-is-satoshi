@_date: 2018-01-18 02:28:00
&amp;lt;sigh&gt; alright, here's my idiot charity for the day:
You claim it would take 25 years to make 300% gain on a principal investment in the stock market. That's factually incorrect based on average returns (12%) and somewhat basic math (compounding growth). In fact, it only takes *six* years at that rate to double your money or *nine* years to triple it. You obtain average market returns by investing in an index fund which, by definition, performs *exaxtly* as well as the market. 
Are you still confused? I never mentioned anything about trading bitcoin on the stock market becuase that's fucking retarded and I have no idea why you thought anyone was ever suggesting anything like that. Do you understand now or is your head full of moths?
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:32:56

Does OP not understand how anemic the volume on those futures are? Take off the tinfoil hat 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:58:31
The liquidity created by the futures market is bound to hurt the price, either through short trading (speculation the price will go down) or asset replacment were actual bitcoins are sold and replaced with options contracts that hedge the underlying risk of holding said bitcoins on an exchange with relatively long and unpredictable transaction times.
No matter how you look at it, the futures present an alternate way to for BTC investors to invest which will naturally eat up some of the demand for BTC and drive the price lower. Thats more or less a sure thing.
The million dollar question is if such a downward pressure will precipitate a "run on the exchanges" that drives up transaction times and lowers the price so much that sell orders start filling well below anticipated price levels creating additional cadcades of selling. This is exactly what happened during the great depression to eventually drive the US away from the gold standard and into a fiat system-- something Bitcoin had hoped to reverse with its own algorithmic money supply system. Right now it's looking pretty vulnerable.

Apparently he doesn't... Becuase wall street isn't going anywhere near buying BTC. They're going to be buying futures contracts that are completely cash settled and will induce exactly 0 real coins to be bought sold on any exchange, period. 
The downward pressure is likely to come from more sophisticated investors hedging their BTC investment by *selling real BTC* and buying XBT contracts on the CBOE (an actually regulated exchange that can be sued in the US) for a fraction of the price required to hold BTC. Not only will it encourage some selling of BTC, it will offer an alternative, safer way for people to participate in BTC without actually buying coins on an exchange. 
More selling + less buying = depressed asset price.

Stocks... are cheaper and have earnings to back up their valuations. I’m glad you have a healthy attitude about crypto but if you’re going to make just a few hundred bucks a month, why not sell puts on stocks you wouldn’t mind owning? Those profits are more tax advantaged than crypto profits and having a margin brokerage account will help your credit. You wouldn’t even have to pick individual stocks, you could do it on one of the many ETF products that exist today or even entire indexes.
The bonus being that long term, you know any position you get put to you will most likely appreciate... whereas probably 80% of the crypto market is likely to consolidate.
Don’t write off stocks as something purely for rich people! The stock market has been the greatest driver of individual wealth for a hundred years. Crypto is subject to all kinds of unknown risks and is more likely than not, worthless. 
Plus from what I’ve seen, the power consumption of mining is rarely justified by the value mined... unless you live near a vast source of cheap energy which is subject to change quickly

"distributed ledger" is not a complicated thing to understand. It's just not a groundbreaking technology, it doesn't really disrupt any particular business. I think a lot of people who espouse faith in blockchain haven't really spent any time understanding the magnitude of cash that goes in to current ledger technology. A centralized ledger isn't particularly cumbersome or expensive for any industry (we still use computers, after all). The best use case seems to be these digital currencies which impose their own cumbersome limitations.
I wouldn't discount Buffet's business sense and lack of interest in cryptocurrency. If he saw blockchain as creating an"economic moat" he would bother to understand it. The fact is, blockchain currently solves problems that nobody really cares about, it doesn't significantly lift any kind of financial or logistical burden that can't be solved more reliably with more traditional technology. The goalposts have been continuously moved for the significance of bitcoin. You can discount Buffet all you like but when the smartest financial leaders all agree that something isn't as groundbreaking or valuable as retail investors seem to think.... it's no particularly smart to ignore them and discount their opinion because "they don't understand." 
They aren't idiots. They understand money and business much better than you or I. They've lived through a lot more disruption than you or I. It rarely pays to be a contrarian. What do you know about M3 and the world history of financial regulation? How many market crashes have you survived? What influences the Fed decision to raise the fed funds rate? These guys manage trillions of dollars. Only a fool would choose to bet against the house in the long term.

Bitcoin has been in a sustained downtrend since the beginning of the year. Every purchase in 2018 has been a losing proposition. Nobody should be trying to buy BTC until it finds a bottom and stops making these lower lows/highs. Even if you believe in the underlying technology, you should be trying to get the best price possible and on a technical basis (and for lack of any fundamentals on which to base pricing) this thing has broken down completely and is in free-fall. Wait for the pain to end before dipping your toe in / averaging your cost down. Sometimes sitting on your money is the best move you can make.

First around $8,500 in the short term, then the low of ~$6,900 but I believe $6,500 to be a psychologically important level and the most likely level of resistance should the downtrend continue. 
It could easily break below that very quickly given the momentum and volatility. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:14:27
Don't forget the difference in price of physical goods across int'l borders creates currency imbalances that drive changes in the forex market and that the changing money supply + interest payments on bonds actually change the fundamental value of the USD (which has been dropping precipitously, signaling inflationary conditions in addition to a flattening yield curve bound to send us into a ~2020 recession, thanks for the poorly distributed tax stimulus at full employment, Trump and GOP! Fiscally conservative my ass).
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:10:57
No, like I said-- the value can only increase with new buyers because there are no earnings (like with equities) or interest (like with bonds) or trade imbalances (like with forex) to create a natural appreciation of value. 100% of the value of BTC comes from speculation (on what remains a mystery).
I don't know how you got to volatility but I'm certain you can't provide any reason why Bitcoin would appreciate in value if, in a hypothetical situation, every coin had been mined and everyone chose to hold. 99% of Bitcoin and other crypto investors have no idea what they're doing.

And yet by natural design it doesn't scale well.

Suppose blockchain does get implimented in a major way, why does that increase the value of Bitcoin? It doesn't. Blockchain isn't some proprietary system that companies can buy, profits made from blockchain don't get distributed to holders of Bitcoin. *The only way for Bitcoin to appreciate is by new money buying coins at increasingly higher prices.* That's pure speculation, my friend. The greater fool theory at its finest. 
"Value" is relative but in most cases it's backed by some underlying fundamental source of income. Growing corporate profits, interest yields, dividend payments. With stocks you can extrapolate a price-to-earnings ratio. With yields you can calculate an objective ROI. You can calculate neither of these for Bitcoin. Why? Because the price is based 100% in speculation. BLOCKCHAIN DOES NOT MAKE MONEY.
The fact that BTC investors have convinced themselves that there's profit to be had by the widespread adoption of the underlying technology (which, frankly, seems unlikely given the scaling problems associated with "proof of work") demonstrates the fundamental disconnect between crypto "investors" and the financial realities of investing capital. 
If anything, it's a hedge against the forex market like gold except gold has an underlying value both for it's metalurgic properties and cosmetic appeal.

Do you... Not understand how money supply works? And to compare any crypto to a fiat currency is absolutely ridiculous. Like I said (and the IRS agrees), it's a digital asset. There is no underlying value, only speculative value. If nobody wanted to buy Bitcoin tomorrow, the price would drop to $0. If nobody wanted to buy dollar pairs in the forex market, you'd still be able to order your McDonalds dollar menu dinner.

You appear to be the only person who's made the comparison (I just used gold as an example in my last response to someone else) and you're not wrong to compare the two but you forget that gold has metalurgic and cosmetic properties that drive demand as well as the fact that certain currencies are still backed by gold. 
This is not the case for Bitcoin and represents a fundamental difference between the two. The only demand for Bitcoin comes from speculation.

Wrong again bucky, fiat currency doesn't derive its value from speculation. It's guaranteed by the government 
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:27:26
It was actually $11,694 but there's some variance to be expected during intra-day trading. The key is that it didn't break out above that level and thus failed an important test of investor resolve.
People saw the price reach the last peak and decided to sell rather than buy more... That's the main point to take away from this. In the investing world this called a "double top"

Oh really? Explain that one. Artificial scarcity exists on video game skins.

So you don't understand how monetary policy works or the fed funds rate? Color me surprised, a Bitcoin finatic who loves to espouse the benefits of a decentralized currency has no understanding of the fundamentals of money. Shocking.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:52:42
It's digital Monopoly money. It's really no different than any other digital asset, like video game skins. The price is 100% driven by speculation because there are no fundamentals. 
And if it doesn't break out above $11,600 it's going back to $6,500
Edit: I'm sad the guy calling technical analysis worthless deleted all his comments... He was supposed to check back in a month to see why he was wrong but looks like he didn't even want to wait a week after being proven wrong. What a shame, I wanted to rub it in his face.
How embarrassing for him. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:26:49
You can use it to buy things. You can expand the supply to meet aggregate demand. Two things BTC cannot do.

No I'm just sick of trying to describe basic economics to people who will grasp at straws to begrudgingly refuse the truth, even when laid out directly in front of them. 
Visa handles 150M transactions a day and you seem to have no concept of M1. There's no point in arguing with an idiot

Lol, too many of you don't realize how you reinforce exactly what Dimon has said ABOUT BTC. How many of you passed any kind of macroeconomics class? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:42:26
Bitcoin is down 57% from the all time high but people still think 2018 will be a good year for BTC?
That train has left the station, the only people left are bag hodlers. 
Edit: as you guys spend your time downvoting me and sucking each other's dicks, the price continues to fall and your wealth continues to diminish. You were warned!

I don't want to play economics teacher for the hundredth time today but maybe open an economic book and learn the fundamentals of fiat currency, maybe pay attention to the part about leaving the gold standard

If you're still holding Bitcoin you're still "holding the bag." The price continues to make lower highs and lower lows... Looking at $6,500 now while hoping to break above $9,224.39 and maybe find a bottom

How do you feel about technical analysis now? Maybe it's time you researched how an economy works so you have a better understanding of how assets are traded.

Shhhh Reddit doesn't understand monetary policy... Don't bother bringing up the other half dozen times the Fed adjusted rates to keep the world economy from crashing

Only a poor person could be so ignorant about money. I'm sorry things aren't working out better for you; maybe if you educate yourself more thoroughly you can begin to change your situation?

Earth. The round one with water. My day job has me working as an analyst at a research firm. My portfolio has an average annualized return over the last 5 years of &gt;30%. I'm pretty confident in my knowledge on this particular subject. You know how its painfully easily to point out bullshitters when they start talking about a subject you understand really well? 
This is one of those moments.
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:08:37
Its really hard to have a debate when one person doesn't have a proper understanding of facts or definitions related to the topic-- I literally gave you a timeline of fed intervention over the last 50 years. You responded with your own (incorrect) definition of capitalism and said something about "socializing losses." Good day.

This is not like your favorite restaurant closing, this is what a bursting bubble looks like. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 17:09:29
And that's just recently, it doesn't even go back to the sterling crisis of 1967. 
In a world market, which is arguably more efficient due to division of labor and greater liquidity, monetary policy is essential to stability in the face of crisis. Reddit has a really weird relationship with capitalism. (Isn't this site owned by Condé Nast?)
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:09:37
You're focused on the wrong things. Sure, Bitcoin developments are nice... 
But you should be focused on the dollar and world monetary policy since cryptos are really a proxy for the dollar / a Fiat intermediary.
Yesterday gold was up while BTC and ETH were down 3%. That's a divergence to worry about. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:05:38
Why do you think the global Fiat currency system is bound to crash? Like, what specifically is going to do such a thing that would be immune to influence by global central banking? It would take nuclear holocaust and a dissolution of world governments... So naturally your doomsday preparation is to invest in a digital, intangible currency that relies on internet access? That's what's going to outlive the dollar?
You realize how crazy / stupid that sounds, right? Do you understand the first thing about monetary policy? BTC is a currency proxy / derivative... It's not a bet against Fiat currency and you're going up against real forex traders who are faster and smarter than any retail investor... 
@_date: 2017-07-08 19:03:57
And yet there seems to be an endless stream of users who want to debate the merits of capitalism based on their own personal definitions of it.

@_date: 2017-07-15 17:17:05
In addition to how ugly the charts are and the magnitude of the divergence... Yeah, it's a good reason to worry. This is a popped bubble that has broken through support. Nevermind about Yellen's comments on inflation. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:28:40
Holy shit... You should read a different book than the ones you've read so far.... Not only do most companies go public well over the price of a dollar (usually they want to be actually listed on an exchange) but they usually do so after about 10 years of being in business... And it's pretty easy to post impressive earnings growth WHEN YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO PREVIOUS ESRNINGS OF $0! 
Company is not profitible and probably never will be. You're whats known in tge business as "the greater fool"
Look it up. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:10:04
Inflation is good for the economy not because it forces people at home to buy more but because it boosts *exports*, as inflation rises the value if the dollar goes down which reduces the cost of exchange between us and foreign nations/- *their* money is worth more relative to ours which allows them to buy more goods for the same price or less compared to when the dollar is strong.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:24:56
This is the kind of anecdote an inexperienced retail investor would make, feel free to hold the bag. If you don't understand the significance of that divergence then you deserve to lose your money-- that's how the market works. 
You're not investing, you're gambling. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:34:18
Check back in a month when BTC has shed 20% from yesterday 
Edit: already a quarter of the way there. That's what I love about investments-- the proof is in the price action. I get to be right *and* you lose money. Your mention of an "economic class" tickles me considering you have no idea who I am.
Edit2: actually it looks like we're already 20% down from the high Friday... Sucks for you, the pain isn't even close to over yet 
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:28:47
Notice now BTC is under $2K... When money managers see these warning signs they act decisively. Inexperienced retail investors are left holding the bag. At what price will you realize you're too late? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:23:49
What a stupid idea! Pay a non-deductuble high interest rate to catch a falling knife in a digital fiat derivative in the middle of a crash facing record uncertainty? 
Why not just go to a casino, take out a loan from them AT A SIMILAR RATE and just gamble? You have a better chance of winning at the craps table taking true odds. 
Or better yet, read a few fucking books on investing (you're 27, time to grow up a little) and start a brokerage account, take out a margin loan from there which will have an interest rate equal to or lower than the minimum personal loan rate and whose interest is *tax deductible* and invest in some shit you actually half understand! Look how well NVDA and AAPL and FB have done this year! The stock market is where all these "you haven't lost if you haven't sold" sayings come from because, on the whole, the stock market has continuously moved UP on a long term basis since inception. The same cannot be said about BTC or even fiat currencies for that matter.  
There are too many first-tike investors in this trade / sub who thought they were smart investors because BTC was reaching new highs! Now you guys are going to have to face reality that you weren't smart, you were lucky and that luck ran out before you could realize the truth.

You should open a macroeconomics book sometime before attempting to make economic arguments on the internet
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:41:42
... you've read a whopping 6 books and want to invest in a penny stock that makes experimental laser sperm analysis systems? And you think you're smarter than every other BTC trader and will make money based on their emotional reactions to news, price, and other inputs? Because that's what predominantly controls the value of the BTC/USD trade?
If that were the case, why didn't you sell at $3000/BTC? 
You're in for a rude awakening

Underrated comment 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:29:07
An unregulated currency backed by nobody... there's a reason why no REAL money (read that however you want) is invested in this... for the same reason theres no REAL money in activision/Blizzard stock.
The mechanics of the bitcoin essentially make it a cyber-ponzi scheme and what you saw was the penultimate tier in the pyramid cashing in. 
You could have been earning a 2-4% dividend on top of growth, even higher in REITs... you can get taxed less on too.
"Don't make [bitcoin] out to be something it's not"
Let's remember one very important fact: Bitcoin isn't there to help you out or make you feel better. They're there to make MONEY.
Stop kidding yourselves and for the sake of your families, leave the fiscal decisions up to someone smarter.
