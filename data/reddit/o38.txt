I had the same idea earlier this week. A pot that carried over if no one won, would be great. The odds, at first, should be a lot easier than 175 mil, or 290 mil to 1.
It seems to me that some sort of multi sig could be used with an automated payout if there was a winner.

A synopsis:
**1** [A question being asked to Charley Cooper – the Managing Director at R3CEV.](
This guy begins with a non–argument tangent, proclaiming that Bitcoin was created by anti–government/anti–Wall Street sympathizers (assuming this is bad), and continues that he is a part of the group that will actually make the technology relevant or useful. Fortunately – Bitcoin already is, and it doesn't need to comply with regulatory nonsense to achieve success, because it is decentralized. R3 may end up forking Ethereum, or something similar, as admitted later. However, it will atrophy as time and isolation do their part; it is a glorified database. The most interesting part, about his opening, might be the spoiler that Mike Hearn – in a matter of hours – was going to have editorials published about him throwing in the towel.
**2** [He starts eating the danish](
He seems to have some trouble with this.
**3** [Talks some more about Bitcoin not being robust enough for the financial sector.](
**4** [Admits a decentralized blockchain might work in the future for the financial sector. Goes on to say that anonymous nodes are not trustworthy.](
Discusses his thoughts on blockchain derivatives, like colored coins, incentivizing actors to discontinue mining – and instead hack the network (if hacking is more profitable). Should not be a problem if the smart contracts are stored on a centralized ledger or exchange,...oh wait.
**5** [Says R3 is interested in forking the best solution that develops in the free market.](
Names Ripple, Ethereum as examples.
**6** [Takes a sip of coffee and writes a mysterious note to himself.](
**7** [Has no idea how long regulatory agencies will take to green–light R3's technology.](
**8** [Says that government bureaucracy is confusing, slow, and often contradicts itself.](
Again, has little idea on how to solve this. Says he will try but needs everyone's support. Does not know who to contact first in the government (understandable as there are too many redundant agencies).
**9** [Admits banks are hamstrung by needing permission from regulatory bodies before acting.](
Financial institutions need permission before utilizing a "permission–less" system like Bitcoin.
**10** [Spins disposable pen with confidence](
**11** [Claims regulations are not the problem.](
Says the real problem is not knowing what the regulations are, due to inconsistencies. Says he doesn't know what to do, again. I think one could argue that an improvement would be if the regs did not exist, to begin with. Shortly after this, David Wessell (the moderator) says the internet flourished because it existed in a regulatory free environment. However, he thinks this analogy is not fitting for digital currencies.
Summing up his speaking points: Bitcoin can – and should – be separated from bitcoin. Also, R3CEV is going to be shackled by the slow moving &amp; fractured regulatory environment.

I was happy to purchase a couple of Mike Hearn's abandoned coins at a reduced price.
They already hearned a place in my wallet.

That is great!
I recently started using and I could not be more pleased!

Do you mind if I ask where you made this purchase?

Sorry for the poor image quality; it was the best I could come up with.
I just received my Ledger in the mail.
I would like to point out some of my concerns with the build quality:
1) First of all, I disassembled the product, as the the metal exterior, although nice looking, had caked up polishing agent on the edges and inside (where the chip swivels in and out of. I had to clean it up with soap, water, and a wooden dowel.
2) The inside, black piece that the chip is embedded in, has random white spots. It appears to be some sort of paint flaking up. Also, the opposite side of the chip has a discernible purple tinted line, which is reminiscent of pen ink. I am assuming this was the scoring mark before it was cut.
3) The chip itself is off center, and has noticeable gouge marks that looks like it came into contact with something else that is metal (hard to see in the image). The image actually makes it look more like wear from inserting the device into a USB port. However, I have not placed it into a port even once. It is like someone manually placed the chip into the exterior plastic piece, with some glue. There are cavities of space around the chip, created by the space between the chip and the plastic housing.
This device looks used, at best. Should I be concerned with using this? Could it actually be used or tampered with? I bought it through Amazon.
I am not confident that using this to store wealth is in my best interest or not. The product is quite a bit different from what the marketing materials showed. Clearly, these are all hand made, which is usually a good thing...
Has anyone had similar experiences, or am I the anomaly? Is this what I have to deal with by being an "early adopter". I would appreciate feedback from someone from the Ledger team as well. Btw, everything else that came with the Ledger seems nice and high quality, like the password card – for example. Also, I would like to give my appreciation for BTC companies providing products, including Ledger.
