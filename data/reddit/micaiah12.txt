Didn't the founder of LTC just basically abandon it? And it hasn't have weeks of development that I've seen..

Isn’t that like the equivalent to Tim Cook selling all his Apple shares?

Sweet. So I can watch and finish them all before my transaction goes through!

I got one ETH payment from some old dude. I never expected anyone to pay with cryptos, but I like giving our customers options. I got more then a dozen “oh you accept cryptos that’s awesome” or people pointing at the bitcoin sign and smiling. That part was cool. We go to this market weekly till about mid June. I’ll keep accepting cryptos and see if I get lucky.

Still counts as money though. As a customer, you can think that. Me as a merchant, I choose to accept popular forms of money as it allows my customers more options.

Btc and bch are both money to me. I’ll take both. Thanks though ��

I got a single ETH payment. Not even advertising as taking ETH, but the guy asked and since I had an ETH wallet I just did the transaction for him.

Not a whole lot of time. There is some time where the customer is looking through a variety list so if they ask, there is time to talk about it while they are reading. I had a lot of people come over and notice the sign and either smile and nod or “oh sweet bitcoin. Nice!”. I also had an older lady come over and look at plants and mention “bitcoin huh, I’m too old for that stuff. It scares me how new it is” to which I thought was funny. More so that some old lady in the middle of Montana has somehow known enough about bitcoin to recognize the icon and make an opinion about it. 
As for payments. I wasn’t planning on waiting around for their TX to clear. All the sales are low priced so them paying and taking off with $6 worth of plants isn’t a huge deal and the people around here are honest I’m not really worried about them scamming me. Now if someone were to come up and buy say $100-400 worth of plants I believe the transaction would clear by the time we had loaded up the plants In their wagon/cart/etc. If not I would consider holding the plants till a transaction would clear just because of the high sale. I know bch isn’t appreciated in this thread, but one of the reasons why I make it an option is because of the ability to accept 0-conf so easily. Just my opinion.

Good friend in the picture. I’m the one taking the picture. :D

I think he does, he needed the /s added into it :D

I’ve never had a complaint about any of the plants I’ve sold. Over 15 years of selling these. Nothing scammy about that!

I mine and own plenty of bitcoin. My point was in a powerless environment. Bitcoin in useless. Which kinda sucks. Thankfully this is rare.

Down as well. I had to pay with cold hard cash ��
