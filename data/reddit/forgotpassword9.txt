Can someone explain the benefits of tor support?

Take advice from strangers on Reddit with a grain of salt....maybe even a tablespoon. Just do a little homework yourself, until you feel comfortable enough to pull the trigger.

Eventually, 21 million bitcoins will be mined and that will take place around the year 2140. However, many have already been lost and the total circulating supply will not be 21 million. Also, along with consuming a ton of energy and computational power, it will take a very long time to mine that last bitcoin.

My favorite so far is Green Wallet. Super clean and easy to use. I’ve experimented with all the big ones, ie. BRD, Mycelium, Blockchain. Second favorite hit wallet would be Trust.
