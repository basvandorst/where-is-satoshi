its just the beginning. Binance 6 months ago had less than a thousand users and was only in mandarin. then they opened up english translation. and added more coins. my point is, this is a great start. Robinhood is a legit platform and will bring trust with it, one step at a time.

Divergence comes in many forms and is an “affect” seen from buying and selling forces “diverging” in the form of chart action.
Example: if you see BTC dump to 9500 then again to 9000 an hour later but the RSI goes from 35 to 45, it’s showing a basic retreat in selling pressure and buyers take over indicating a trend reversal. The trick is to not only wait long enough for it to show but also to play the right time indicators for your move

Honestly, bitcoin and maybe coins near ICO levels are the only ones HODL meme should relate to. Holding coins now that have matured is generally a bad idea as youre honestly better off just holding bitcoin as the alts bleed..badly..every time btc goes up. No sense in losing sat values on alt coins as btc rises when your opportunity cost is simply just holding fucking bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-09-19 15:52:26
I completely agree  except that if things dont change, it'll be worse. It'll be a political and fiancial meltdown as the dollar breaks down from lack of buying power, cost of money skyrockets, and all around financial services disappear. 
Right now, were in a bull run in the stock market from corporate buy backs. Once this tapers off and the buying stops, selling will occur and it'll be fucking massive.

They classified BTC as the worst of all the categories on purpose to slow it till they figure out how to proceed
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:08:44
Its going to get worse before it gets better. we could see 65% or higher with ethereum as weak as it is. Ethereum has helped reverse the dominance in the past, precursing the alt coin run ups, but not its different. Ethereum is having major issues. Alts will remain weak until BTC makes a run up, then money will bleed back into alt coins.
So i suspect alt coins will still -50% from here. its going to be bad.

Not only that, but this is the total position value. If the guy was using 10x leverage, the amount 'rekt' would only be  about 10% of 6.5m or 650k. This is also multiple positions (not just one) and the leverages and amount rekt are averaged.

You think this is how it works but history has taught us the opposite in bull markets.
People often hold it as it approaches break even in hopes to sell in net profit for all the pain and agony for holding for so long. greed takes over. not to mention, new money often starts coming in while the price rises quickly due to fomo'ing renewed interest and support. would you buy a new car if no one else is buying it? or do you fomo in when people are buying it in droves and the price starts shooting up? its usually the latter. 
This is just human psychology and behavior. This dictates markets. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:00:46
It’s based off of the graphical representation of going below the rally start point by a significant amount. We’ve only bounced off 6k which was the last low below the last major rally. Meaning we could still dip further. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:13:56
You're an idiot if you think they can't beat us lol.
They don't need to push the price down below 6k. They don't need to do half the shit that *you* think they need to in order to *manipulate* the spot or leverage markets. Most of the time, they're moving OTC anyway, so your *idea* of a whale is likely flawed just like your thinking.
You can hold all you want but all you do is short change yourself of profits by deluding yourself. Sure, its safer, but you leave money on the table. These swings are exactly what makes them money and you sit there with your dick in your hand thinking you're being swindled.
To manipulate the spot market, you only need a small percentage of the liquidity across a major exchange. Snowball effect takes over the rest. Not to mention, intelligent money always plays both sides.
Open up some massive leveraged longs and buy orders at 6k. Sell BTC bags from 6.5k on downward. Market snowballs on low volume. Dump comes in, your longs get picked up. You ride the bounce back up to 6.5k or higher. Either close out positions or reverse into a short. Close out positions again once BTC consolidates.
This literally what just fucking happened on bitfinex and bitmex. Check the time stamps and longs/shorts.
Long story short. Whales don't give *half a fuck* about you, your position, or what you think. You swim in their shit wake and eat it up and say thank you without even knowing it.

the fact that shorts arent going down much i think indicate that they're stacking leverage or liquidation is set well above the 200EMA resistance line. they're betting we reject off resistance and dump out the bottom of this wedge before spring boarding upwards. I'm inclined to agree. I'll likely use a low leverage short around 6.9 - 7.2k, stacked, with tight stops, to test this theory.  If I'm wrong, massive shorts will be liquidated around 7.4-7.6 causing an instant $1k buy up to around 9k. From there we'd likely consolidate around 6.5-7.5k before ralling up again
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:03:23
Reverse it. When a coin is going UP and hits a resistance 6 times it eventually pushes up through it. Breaks it up. Same thing in reverse in a bear market. Continue to beat on the support and we fall through it. I think we’ll see it in October. Why? We skip over a low every 4 months. Feb = 6k April = 6.4k; June = 5.8k August = 6k; October = New Low.
I could be wrong but given we haven’t hit disparity phase yet I think we still going lower

Why the fuck do u think GS news would dump the price? No one cares about their trading desk. It was small news months ago and now all the sudden it’s big? You people look for news to correlate a dump when in reality it’s because of market or economic factors. Not news. Sure, sometimes news plays a role but not here.
Next time BTC nestles Up against the resistance line, you’ll see an article that states “bitcoin is the boogy man!” And blame it for the price dump

He should stick to programming and hire a PR specialist to circumvent the foot-in-mouth dumb comments he seems to let leak out.
Just because he’s a primary developer behind Ethereum doesn’t mean he knows dick about this market or where it goes. Sure, he has opinions and sure he can express them, but by doing so he risks discrediting himself as someone who claims to be an expert investor in this space. He’s grasping at straws to stay relevant when he should keep his fucking head down and get to work fixing the shit storm Ethereum is in.

We need tax breaks for crypto. It’s as simple as that. 
In 2016 we had a docket on the agenda to vote on a $600 spending cap tax free for using bitcoin but it got rejected, I forget at which level. Basically it’s not worth it to spend crypto if we have fiat because we’re taxed on it as income at the point of sale which is fucking regarded.

You are vastly over simplifying this whole thing. You think its weak hands as in a singular event but its continuous. Maybe you've been strong for 6 months but sooner or later, they are betting on you selling or buying their profits. They count on this. this makes them money. You fomo in and buy their profits while they scoop up a constant supply of scared money, always recirculating. 
I dont think you understand the scale and options large money has to push this full time. They can reap small profit percentages all fucking day long and make 100x more than you do in a year.

Someone. Someone didn’t want this to happen. That isn’t news related. That could be construed as manipulation which isn’t out of the question either. That, I will give you. However, also consider that one wrongly drawn line at incorrect markers invalidates 99% of TA. This is where people get it wrong and this is where people blame TA for being bullshit. In reality, for one, these resistance lines could be off. Second, TA is based directly off human behavior output as data points on a chart. That human behavior is also erratic and not 100% inline with itself. That’s why most traders suggest not to look for break ups or downs on anything under a day or weekly chart when it comes to major movements 
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:08:17
Your analogy is fucking horse shit. I get your point. Truths are true until they’re not. I get it. But these are scientific calculations based on historical data. Bitcoin is fit to the log chart and anyone can extrapolate a median trend line based on the movement price.
You can’t make this shit up. You can’t call it a lie. It’s literally the graphical plot points of real fucking data showing trends.

News gets posted. Its perceived as either good, or bad. Market freaks out and price adjusts according to sentiment. 1-2 days later, the truth behidn the news comes out and the market sentiment flips 180. Price readjusts based on the new perception. Market looks like a bunch of idiots. People cry and yell manipulation. Repeat.

IF we look at the trend line on the log chart, you’ll see we’re still pretty far off from the median line. We can continue moving down this line to the $3k range. However, we can also move sideways and hit the line in about 6-9 months. Or, we can pop up and slowly head back down like we did In 2014-15.
Regardless we’re a ways away from that trend line. Closer we get to it, the sooner we move back up

If you look at the log chart and fill in the trend line from 2012 till now, you’ll see we’re still a long ways off from touching it. Makes me think we ain’t seen shit yet.
Also touching resistance as support from pre bubble isn’t a definitive call. The despair phase clearly states we go below the rally starting point of the bull run. We haven’t hit that yet. When this wedge ends, we’re gonna dip hard as fuck to 4.5k and spring up

TA is analytics data drawn out based on human behavior of the market conditions. That’s the easiest way to state it. Human behavior is what is being recorded and that’s why people tend to draw conclusions on predicting that next behavior move. Humans are the ones selling or buying at certain conditions, causing the charts to look the way they do. But why? What’s causing those behaviors and decisions. Where are their catalysts? That’s why TA is useful but not all inclusive! Same reason psychologists are useful but don’t have all the answers.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:15:35
the reason shorts are so high is because were in a downward wedge that usually plays to the downside about 65% of the time. Some may call bullshit on TA but these whales see the TA playouts mixed with market sentiment and push it in their favor. They know the trendlines. they know where the resistances are. they will short the fuck out of btc at high leverage and dump on spot at the resistance point in a downward wedge to short, make massive money on the way into 5k and reverse it. you'll be left with your dick in your hand, wondering wtf just happened.

@_date: 2018-09-29 16:23:25
If you look at the log chart just as a historic indicator of how BTC moves in the past, you’ll see based on the trend line from the last 5 years that we’re a good 3-6 months out from even retouching that trend line. This means we might go sideways for a long while. We might go down to meet the trend faster. We also might ignore the trend and pop up and down as shit happens.
Bottom line is, this prediction is most certainly a possibility but also unlikely as the network effect grows faster

While I agree to a certain extent, Vitalik also needs to shut the fuck up honestly. 
He has no business opening his mouth to anything other that what Ethereum is or isn't doing. He isn't an economist. He isn't a trading professional. He isn't a fucking marketing professional. He doesn't know dick about where this market will go. He speculates. He warns. He doesn't know. Truth is, no one does, but he feels entitled to a soap box because of Ethereum.
He should stick to building and growing Ethereum and stop feeding the trolls and social fires that are his foot-in-mouth comments. They only make shit worse. 
Fix Ethereum and clean your fucking house before commenting on market cycles, predictions, or value.

You have no idea what you’re talking about lol
Bitcoin has 2 use cases. Medium of exchange and currency. It’s clearly a shit store of value due to the 70% drop this year alone. It’s a shit currency because no one is spending their BTC and no one is accepting it. It’s a moderate medium of exchange acting as the currency to buy other alt coins. Remove that and BTC is fucking worthless.
We need to turn this ship around and your outlook isn’t helping. It’ll never be a store of value without being used.

So far we havent seen anything but articles on it. no real proof of its launch, but thats not to say it wont be ready on time and go through.
if it does, the results will be purely hype at first. it'll take a few months for the spot market to reflect what OTC markets are doing. 
BAAKT wont be buying from coinbase or anything, so it'll be basically bought behind the scenes so its impact will be limited at first.

6500 isnt the support. the 50 Day MA is around 6900-7k.
Feb dip was 6k. April was 6.4k, May is going to be 6.8-7k depending on exchange. Look at the RSI as well. We need to penetrate or bottom out on the lower RSI just like it did the last 2 dips. This basically will liquidate the open longs creating a flash buy to cover them and surge the market up by easily $700 in about 30 minutes.

We’re in the despair phase Dude. Relax. The masses here in Bitcoin aren’t the same as the rest of the real world. Even if they are, sentiment changes as markets fluctuate.

Big money opens up lots of log positions at 6.1k. they dump the spot market and let it snowball the rest of the way down using low volume liquidity. Longs get filled. they then buy the bottom, instigating the spot market in the reverse. market rebounds in 15 minutes and goes even higher as they keep buying. Longs hit 5-10% profit (or 50-100% profit on 10x leveraged longs) and they close positions at the top. They just made money going down, up, and back down. if they scraped even 10% profit on 15million thats 1.5m in about an hours worth of work. all. day. long.

Bulls arent' just waiting in a closet to bust out and wreck house dude. This is a fast paced slow methodical game. There is ZERO media attention right now to facilitate a market push upwards. We had it in November and December with holiday chatter and Koreans fomo'ing in to a newly open market. We dont have that anymore.
What we need is to let the accumulation phase set in and we will slowly build up. We're not gonna just SHOOT UP. Thats not how this works.
What will happen is we will hit an equilibrium probably after a temporary spike and retracement (3rd rally) and then slowly build up steam at the rate of maybe $1-2k a month. it wont be till we hit the bear trap and critical mass that well get another major push. this will coincide with a major media push too.

You left out (conveniently) several bearish indicators that would correlate with a price reversal. A short term bullish mentality against several bearish resistance points in a bear market is more than enough to reject trending price action. Sure, manipulation could be at play and sure, news can play a role too, but the fact that the price dumped when only garbage ass news was present is a strong indicator in itself that price action and news aren’t mutually exclusive. If you think they are then you just disproved your own fucking argument seeing as the show trending price accumulation wasn’t based off of any news. That means price can also reverse in the same conditions.

the bitcoin bottom can be found when hashrate drastically falls off. that is where the bottom of the price will reside. bulls may never let it get to that, but if we stay in a bear market, the moment miners shut off their rigs due to the difficulty not correcting fast enough, well find the bottom

4.4k is roughly 80% retracement which coincides with previous massive corrections. other years have gone as low as like 83-85% down. 
I think if this is a true bear market, we'll see support around 4.5k

Your shitty argument is the definition of a straw man.

You use FUD like a fucking 5 year old child. It stands for FEAR, UNCERTAINTY, and DOUBT. Exactly what someone should have for a tethered currency that has no substantiated backing except for those operating off its propped up position.
you should be questioning *everything* about tether, manipulation, fraud, wash trading, spoofing, and any other questionable tactic used in this market to protect yourself. Sticking your head in the ground because you don't want to recognize any signs is just ignorant.

Bitfinex is a fucking crook. Use Bitmex.
Bitmex if you do 10x leverage or 10 BTC with 1 down, if the price moves 9.5% in the wrong direction, you lose your 1 BTC. If you do 25x it’s basically 3.5%. 50x is 1.5%.

Not entirely sure as I don’t know where Bitfinex is based out of. But if Tether goes down, the whole market will get fucked like mt gox hack. Trust me. They’d shut down Bitfinex and EthFinex, Tether would be frozen most likely, and the market would easily plummet another 40%

If this comes close to fruition, couldnt we anticipate the attack early and dump to ETH?
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:48:08
I think a combination of something like ETH and BTC could be the answer. Somewhere between mining and proof of stake. Somewhere between a finite fixed supply and am adjusting inflation based on network effect. 
If you have 10 gold coins across 10 people with 10 products, deflation works fine. It’s in a vacuum. However what happens when people go to 100? And products to 1000? Yet there are still just 10 gold coins. Less money to go around a rising population means less spending. More products means a greater devaluation of goods so people produce less if product value continue to drop with efficiencies. Inflation isn’t bad. excessive inflation is just like excessive deflation is.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:19:13

Savings and capita are but ONE aspect of economic growth. If you seriously think a shitty false dichotomy is going to win this argument for you, you’re dumber than I thought. 
Saving money is one aspect of a healthy economy positioned to grow but it is not the catalyst growth comes from. It is spending. You can site all the shitty 7th grade sources you want but you’re still wrong. You don’t spread wealth by hoarding it which is what bitcoin is. There’s zero incentive to use it as a currency in your model. How would growth occur in a vacuum? It won’t.

@_date: 2019-08-07 01:15:16
You honestly think hoarding a resource like bitcoin that can’t even be spent will spur economic growth over every other factor? How stupid are you? Please, never breed. Economic growth at its most basic form that even you should be able to comprehend is the increase over time of goods, services, labor and resources. How will growth occur if no one spends? It’s an element. Not a catalyst. You think a child grows in size from starving themselves? Growth comes from consumption.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:59:46
It's not free money. It's money that was pulled out of the alt coins and new money flowing into Bitcoin prior to the split. Notice how the alt coins didn't rebound as hard as they should have? That's BC the money went to trade BCH instead. It's not free money. It's repurposed money from other coins. It's like how the tide pulls back (BTC/fiat) from the shore (alt coins) only to crash back in a different way (BCH)

if you look at 2014 though, we're basically at the low point now where the run up started. BTC didn't hit that till like 2015. My guess is IF we go any lower, it wont be below 4500 and we'll start to immediately consolidate and recover 3-5x faster than 2014's burst. 
Basically, the next major run will be a catalyst from major news like tokenized securities being accepted, major hedge fund investors (like NY Police department, Walmart, JP Morgan) getting into BTC portfolios, or governments changing their stances on regulation/taxes.
Once the anticipation and FOMO is sparked again and the network worth is low, we're going to recover fast. it wont be slow like 2015/2016

@_date: 2018-06-14 05:55:55
As much as you want it to, Bitcoin has no real value beyond what speculation value we place on it. Banks don’t play that bullshit. Investors or legal standards don’t care. So they will value bitcoin based off the networks value aka the miners who power it. 
So as the price of BTC Continues to fall, we will reach a tipping point where hash rate will drastically drop off as miners walk away from an unprofitable coin. 
The miners who can maintain the bare minimum will create an equilibrium between the difficulty adjustment, the low price, the value and the desire. This will be the true value of bitcoin.
It’s over valued and propped up still. Your TA means jack shit. Your argument about hash rate before the “run up” means jack shit. We were In a constant and steady upward Elliot wave. We’re in a downtrend bear market now. 
Large money aren’t in the calculated business of billion dollar investing to buy your shitty TA, tops, or speculative value. They’re waiting for their definition of value and we’re still over valued

Excessive inflation is.

Perhaps but we’ve been hearing the “Money on the sidelines” bullshit since Feb’s drop to 6k. Nothing has changed. Retail investors have no desire to reinvest in something they made major losses in and traditional investment vehicles can’t touch it legally yet. We need regulation and custodial legal avenues to get major players involved and they won’t even do so until BTC is rebounding off the true value floor which many speculate as being the network cost to sustain bitcoin (around $3k)

But would the average consumer be willing to spend tens of thousands of dollars to buy a sliver of a bitcoin when the value of the network is stagnant and bloated? Its a worthwhile gamble now because the Return on Risk is high, but as price approaches a ceiling of diminishing returns, this might not be the case. 
Bitcoin won't reach 10m/btc valuation just because the 'supply  of money is large enough'
There has to be network demand to go along with it. 7 TPS. High fees. Lightining network vulnerabilities. Entry barriers. Traceable. Government regulations. These are not good adoption incentives for BTC to ever reach 100k/btc let alone 10m regardless of 'money supply'

@_date: 2019-10-01 20:07:45
Perhaps the difference is ingrained in historic perception of gold, it’s availability, usefulness, and valuation of goods it represents. All of which btc is missing being so young
Example: you can buy a physical 14k solid gold ring for say $300 that is gorgeous, meets consumer expectations, is verifiable, reliable, and liquid. Consumers wouldn’t measure gold in grams but rather valuable objects those grams form (rings). Businesses do because that’s how they quantify the product and assign value but consumers don’t care. I don’t see this holding true in the same way for btc for 2 reasons. It’s age and it being an intangible digital agent.

Economies are fueled by growth. Growth happens when consumption occurs. Growth and consumption stagnates under deflationary conditions as goods devalue faster than currency in relation to population growth which only perpetuates the problem.

I disagree. A sign of traffic is a signal that the road is being used, but how heavily is in relation to its infrastructure. Traffic on a massive 6 lane freeway is different than on a 2 lane highway. Right now, BTC network is a shitty 2 lane highway where only 7 cars can pass through a light per second going BOTH WAYS. This isn't a good thing. Sure it means the road is being used, but just because it is 'at capacity' doesn't mean the road is built well or is free of flaws.
Your restaurant argument is just as shitty. A restaurant that serves good food can seat 10 people, or 300 people. A 300 person restaurant at capacity speaks far more favorably to a large population than a 10 person hole in the wall. 
SEVEN TRANSACTIONS PER SECOND. SEVEN. That is a 10 person restaurant where the global audience is looking to reserve a table. That shit will not fly and no amount of fucking global currency supply is going to buy you a seat at that table. 
If bitcoin is ever to reach an unrealistic valuation and be deemed as realistic, then its shitty fucking network needs to be revaluated too

It’ll take another 4 - 6 weeks to hit that. We just started a new Elliot wave.

This. honestly BTC hovering between $1k and $20k is *reasonable* for the common first world consumer. Someone with an average salary and investment desire can purchase a full bitcoin to some degree over time. However, once we start moving through the 20k+ region again, the average investor and consumer for bitcoin will see the price as a barrier and demand could dry up as the asset class is deemed too expensive by traditional standards.
Now i fully know that bitcoin is divisible (satoshi units) to allow for such valuations. However, I am speaking to the psychological aspect of this. People won't want to drop $10,000 USD to acquire .05 bitcoin when just 2 year ago would have bought them 3 full bitcoins. There are entire fields of science and study behind these psychological interpretations and barriers that shouldn't be ignored when it comes to log valuations. 
One might argue that we've already seen this when $10,000 could have bought 10,000 bitcoin, and i would agree, but the difference here is in its degree of scale. We are approaching diminishing returns on value of what the price reflects and what people are willing to spend. Sooner or later we will reach it, and unless bitcoins network value improves (where we can actually use bitcoin every day with tax incentives to buy a plethora of goods and services) than the value won't match.

We just went on a 3 month long buying spree. It can drop even faster than it went up. Never forget this. My main concern is why we went up so fast. Is it trade war? Fed rates? Big firms buying in?

The problem with getting 'paid' in bitcoin is the excessive taxation that occurs on top of your already taxed earnings. 
Sure, i can ask my employer to pay my salary every 2 weeks in crypto, but the taxes id face cashing out back into my bank account to pay rent in a few months would negate much of the gains obtained during that chop. More so if the bear trend continues.
While the idea is empowering, it is not without its flaws and restrictions. Until these excessive taxations are considered, this wont be taken seriously. Imagine asking your job to pay you in Amazon stock. 2-3 months down the line when you sell it to pay for food, you get hit with an extra 30% taxation. Fuck that.

You prove my point. BTC has failed to scale properly so far. It’s reaching right now. It’s on this ice. It can be saved but chances of reaching some absurd valuation as it is without scaling won’t happen.  
Oh and your argument is for a technology, not a product. The technology will evolve and grow. Not bitcoin necessarily. You should understand the difference. The companies who developed the original Hard Disc Drives didn’t survive the technology expansion. New companies with better tech beat them out. Holding fucking Bitcoin with a competitor beating it out of market will mean jack shit. The tech is civil engineering. Bitcoin is a god damn 2 lane dirt road with poor drainage. The future will be a 8 line super freeway and unless btc stops the bullshit, it’ll be another coin that achieves it.

It’s not just about spending it. Sure it is a large part but it’s also a means to hedge inflation, own your money, and promote self governance. 
We can’t have one without the other though. We need people to buy it and hold it to ever spend it. Adoption takes time. Exchange fees, transaction costs, and burden of use has shrank drastically over the last 2 years alone.
Look back to the Hard Disc Drive revolution. HDD were fucking massive when they came out. Inefficient. Costly. Bulky. No one knew how to use them or maintain them. But people saw the potential in them. Refinements were made, generation after generation, until HDD shrank and became as efficient as you see them today. From 8KB to 8TB drives. 2,000lbs to 2.0lbs.
Bitcoin and crypto will follow similar adoption paths. The utility just isn’t fully here yet. Part of taking a risk on it is seeing the future possibility. That’s why you were here to begin with. You just became pessimistic and forgot why. Fundamentals haven’t changed. Adoption is growing. You’re just becoming impatient.

There were also many other means of currency. Spices were huge. “Worth it’s weight In salt” is a phrase for a reason. Salt was a major currency in history and was valued higher than gold at certain times. And yes while the supply could have been stable or even inflated (tulips) as more was discovered or transported in, it wasn’t “printed” like money and it also wasn’t finite like Bitcoin.
The important thing is inflation to match growth is ideal. Not too much where a banana is fucking $8,000 (limitless exponential supply) but not to slow where goods lose all currency value (fixed supply)

Thank you
So many people here fail to understand the value of inflation as it protects against deflation of goods and services. Economies of scale cannot grow without some form of increase to match society growth. This is my fear that bitcoin will lose long term. If population and growth continues, stuff doesn't get more expensive, it gets cheaper. This makes producing and holding goods that would otherwise be investments a poor store of value. Buying real estate would be a terrible investment as new homes are built, the variable isn't bitcoin, but rather the value of your home. With inflation, value can increase to expand while sacrificing some buying power in other areas.

Were not giving banks power. Were applying regulation to work with existing infrastructure to regulate the space. 
Think of it like this..I heard this analogy the other day and it kind of fits... Say we have manifest destiny in 200 years and mankind starts exploring the stars. We have self constructed space ships everyone has access to, capable of going wherever we want and freely leaving the planet. However, in order for chaos to not ensue, we would need some sort of governing regulations to reign in the interactions that could cause catastrophic damage to the whole idea. People crashing into planets, pirates blockading shipping routes, wreckless endangerment. This is basically crypto right now. We're free to trade and buy and use the blockchain, but without some form of bordering regulation to keep the peace, the space will never reach a stable point to flourish. We think it will, but it likely won't. There have been about 12 ICO scams in the month of Feb alone. 
I honestly think 1 of 3 scenarios are going to play out. 
1. The world unites and forms a EU type of group to agree on regulatory rules to enforce in a uniform fashion, around the globe. 
2. Countries give the middle finger to each other (US to China) and do the opposite of each other in terms of regulation on crypto (china bans mining so US promotes it to say fuck you to china)
3. Market crumbles in on itself from lack of regulation, trust, and reliance.

what? no. How fucking retarded are you. I never said that.
I said its primary value is in its medium of exchange. I never said the price tanked because of being able to buy other major coins directly with fiat (which youve been able to do for over a fucking year). You can't, however, buy something like SUB or VEN or WABI or ZRX with fiat. You need BTC or ETH in 99% of the cases (unless youre outside the US and can use Bitfinex). Therefore, BTCs primary value is in its store of exchange in buying secondary coins. Remove that by either replacing BTC with something more versatile, or allow fiat trading pairs, and you remove the last bit of utility an aging technology like bitcoin has.

As long as they understand what it is they are buying, it should come as no surprise. Commodities have been doing it for ages. You dont own gold with gold ETFs, you own a portion of the profits generated by holding a share of it. Coinbases index fund is basically the same thing. As will be others.

TA is nothing more than recording metrics and data from past events to see trends consistently within them. Markets don’t repeat but they sure rhyme. If they rhyme then it stands to reason that similar behavioral patterns will emerge again in the future leading to similar movement patterns. Not necessarily cycles but I think you get it.

You, and the rest of Reddit who can’t seem to grasp the very specific nature of data analysis should know it is not a be-all tell-all method. Sure it’s wrong at times, but it is also right. Market conditions can supersede TA (bad news drops price) but in healthy scenarios, you’ll find consistent behavior trends repeat under like conditions. 
Ever wonder why there is a massive sell off after a massive spike? Gee fucking wiz Batman, that’s Technical Analysis! Elliot waves, consolidation, bumps, runs, dips, resistance and support.

Anyone who doesn't know this is too stupid to buy an ETF let alone bitcoin. Your analogy is misplaced. I get your intent, but you vastly over simplify the issues here. and for ETFs to work, the custodians actually need to legally own and hold the bitcoin they are selling shares of. This is non negotiable. It is a law.

While I can’t argue that point, I will argue this is not how that will go down. 
A bitcoin ETF is history being made. SEC would be under heavy scrutiny for approvals. It’s not who applies, it’s how it’s presented based off the market readiness. If the SEC gets caught playing favorites in any way, they would be beyond fucked.

Lol you don’t understand how this works then.
The custodian themselves *must* buy bitcoin or any other coins they are offering ETFs for but the people buying the portfolios basically get a certificate of ownership of shares which entitle them to profits or dividends. 
If Coinbase has an ETF then Coinbase owns the bitcoin. You own a piece of paper that says you get access to profits they make on it

99% retracement. 
You're full of shit. 
Bitcoin has done some deep retracements in the past back when it was still a nerds novelty and there were two exchanges. If it does it again now when there are over 50 different methods for buying and selling it, we'll have a problem. 
its done 82 and 84% retracements in the past, but never at these levels of volume and awareness. 
And to answer your stupid question, speculative comments are impossible to prove but is based on psychological behavioral patterns of investors regarding deep retracement stocks. People stop buying the dips when it goes beyond the despair phase. They start exiting, and fast. If Bitcoin falls below the 'dip' range, confidence will turn into panic and people will stop buying dips and start unloading, thinking it'll go to zero. 
This isn't anything new. its market behavioral psychology. Go fucking look it up

That means they extend and deny till they’re ready
SEC also released a rejection letter for another ETF rule exception on July 23rd. Exactly 180 days after the submission in early Jan. Coincidence? Hell no. They took the maximum time to say no to buy time.
This isn’t a fucking game people. SEC is playing buy the rules because they know the world is watching and before putting their neck out to jeopardize the traditional financial markets, they will deny this thing 10x over until ready.

This comment is retarded. It’s not based off of fucking power. SEC would be held liable globally for approving an ETF and that means BTC must be ready for it.
Bitcoin is still heavily manipulated, lacking liquidation, and most of the volume is in corrupt exchanges outside the US.

In their defense, those numbers were historically based off historic metrics and not intuitive foresight into future market potential. 
So, yes, as of right now, bitcoin and crypto is highly volatile and extremely risky (hence why we tell people every day not to invest more than they can afford to lose) but doesnt mean it will be forever. After some maturity, the market will be less risky, but the fortunes will already have been made by then :)

You want the market cap to grow, this is the fastest way to do it. Banks works the same way. You think they have all their customers money on hand at once?

The fact that you vastly over simplify it is a pretty clear indicator you have no idea what the fuck you're even talking about. 
Explaining blockchain as simply a 'digital ledger' is like calling an automobile a moving box on wheels.

This is one of the biggest legit causes for concern.
Having roughly 20% already lost means the currency is less far reaching than it could have been. Even with sats, we still have that problem. 
The 1% owning a majority of btc will likely end badly. There isnt a scenario here where btc will likely succeed. Either the rich majority pump btc and exit it (maybe they already are), or the coin dies. As long as it is worth something, the rich will find a way to manipulate it and make money off it in their favor. Their one reach is far superior to thousands of tiny hands scratching at a misguided direction for owning bitcoin. Most people now cant even be convinced to buy it. By the time a decent percentage of them try to, it will be too late. The rich will already have most of it.

i believe ledger goes through 3rd party audits to validate there is no communication with the stored private key. however an update, unless blocked by hardware (which i believe is on the X) could eliminate this. 
In theory it would be very hard though. their brand is built off security so employees are hired just for security validation. A CEO or bad party couldn't easily manipulate and guise an entire team to benefit an exploit easily if one was slipped in, since their business is based around not letting one slip in. its a catch 22
