I am assuming that because the nature of anonymity with bitcoin,that bitstamp could not truly reveal  winners of the sweepstakes. With that said there is absolutely no way to prove that this was not rigged in favor of a certain person or group.
Most sweepstakes have to be transparent.

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:02:38

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:55:53
Absolutely unfounded claim,there is no way that **coinbase** paid me to tell people to **buy bitcoin cash**.

@_date: 2014-09-09 22:26:06

@_date: 2016-01-15 03:23:05
I understand the blockchain,just was asking for a source that he is employed by big banks.
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:21:13
What are his reasons?
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:38:37
We did it reddit!
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:39:14
This sucks for bitcoin(imho) the idea of decentralized currency is something that we as a society need.The user base of 2012(not early adapters circa 2009-10) needed to hit the ground running but failed to do so which led to the adaptation of bitcoin to be sluggish. "Big Banks" have the user base/power to implement their version of the blockchain to the masses laterally and claim it as their own...Sad day for me,but I will not loose my faith.

Sorry for asking the question,i was on mobile and not in the best area for a full page to load in a timely fashion.I read the article and understand.
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:34:16
Source on that? 
@_date: 2016-01-14 22:43:51
Can someone eli5?
@_date: 2016-01-15 00:38:51
I understand it,at that time I needed a tl;dr because I was impatient,should've just waited the ten minutes.Thanks for the offer though!
@_date: 2016-06-01 21:57:50
Jesus,he is "asking around" you know in a sub reddit specializing in the information pertaining to said question. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:26:56
I googled R3CEV...so give me a minute.
@_date: 2015-08-23 04:01:13
I accept bitcoin,so that means I am better...right?
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:12:04
Why are mods deleting content?And what content are they deleting?
@_date: 2016-02-18 09:41:33
Wasn't it difficult as all hell to purchase them then?
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:29:53
He is a second tier bitcoin "speaker"(paid at that) that his only claim to fame is a (imho) fake story about a tsa agent stopping him because of his bitcoin hoodie.
@_date: 2016-02-06 08:19:30
@_date: 2016-02-06 07:26:22
Watch (listen) to the video, the guy is a tool,tsa antagonist.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:12:12
Why is that?
