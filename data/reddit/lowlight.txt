What I am saying is that I'm not completely against Adblock. What I am against is using it to block every single site you visit, by default. What I suggest is the best way to show support to content creators is to enable ads by default. If they're bad, then block them. If not, then why not let the site that you are enjoying make some money doing what they do?
And I'm not talking about sites like 9gag or buzzfeed, I mean actual real content sites, who have authors writing new, unique, informational content.

This is 100% exactly what I did with THIS VERY EXCHANGE last week, putting some funds into an alt "just in case" it gets big. I had to install their wallet, but I didn't want to leave my money in the exchange for a minute longer than I needed to.
Dodged a bullet.. wow!
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:23:52
I think that's better than nothing, but I run mine with default off and it's not bad at all for the sites I visit. The only ones that are really bad are the sketchy download sites and porn sites anyway. For those, block them. For the rest, ads usually aren't nearly as intrusive as mail flyers.

I bet at  and it couldn't be simpler. No need for an account or anything.. Set up your bet slip, send money to the address, and they will send your winnings back if you win. 
Keep a note of the bet URL in case you need to contact them for support (I never have)
I haven't bet much more than a few dollars at a time, but I have won a few times, and they always pay pretty quickly (but not immediately)
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:47:16
First thing I noticed too..
Spend your bitcoin, people! I think it needs to be used as a currency for it to actually become one.
I use it whenever I can - if I am shopping and one place accepts bitcoin, I ALWAYS go to that place. After I buy with bitcoin, I just deposit some fiat into my local exchange and buy back the bitcoin. Actually I saved a bit of money this way due to the recent price drop :D 
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:41:02
Huh, maybe it's because I only bet in small amounts that I have never had a problem. That's scary but I think I'll stick with them for my small bets :) I wouldn't recommend them for anything bigger though

Thanks for clearing things up. Note that I wasn't trying to be malicious with my comment, I was just sharing my thoughts at the time. These days, especially with bitcoin, we expect to be able to do everything instantly. It was discouraging to have to register and wait to even be able to do an ATM deposit, and I just needed a quick question answered before I could even see if I could complete a registration.

@_date: 2014-04-11 05:32:15
If you believe in bitcoin as a system, and aren't simply using it to buy and sell for fiat to make a quick buck, then it doesn't matter what the actual price is. If you don't sell it, you don't lose anything. 
The 'end goal' for Bitcoin is for it to become a viable payment system and/or currency for the world. Until it reaches that goal, it doesn't matter that it costs $400 to buy one, or $1000, or $50. None of it matters, because if it succeeds, it will be invaluable.
Until it completely crashes or completely succeeds though, nobody has 'lost' anything.
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:09:28
This happens quite often in China, and even in Hong Kong. They constantly run public service ads that people are insured for $13,000 (USD), so don't panic if you hear a rumor. 
A few years ago there was a [bank run in  Hong Kong]( at the Bank of East Asia

I sure hope so, but to me bitcoin represents the exact opposite of what that culture is used to.
I was just getting into it during those 6 months, and brought it up several times in conversations (never in a "Shit Bitcoin People Say" way don't worry ;)). Most people had no idea what I was talking about, and the rest were skeptical. These are mostly university students, with a lot of econ students, which I found interesting

My main issue is that this guy is supposed to be a big investor in Bitcoin related services, and should therefor have some authority on the subject. But he knew absolutely nothing about it, to the point where the 'idiot in the room' (which is usually a great way for most people to learn) was never addressed properly. Instead, even more uncertainty and doubt was added.
I don't know if he was just too drunk or high to remember anything, but he didn't come across very well at all on this podcast. Andreas did a much better job when he was on.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:24:46

I don't see anyone bringing up Gox other than the people saying this is nothing like Gox.
No shit.
The point of this article is what happens when an institution (Gox or whatever else) fails. 
When Gox fails, they die and go away, other exchanges learn from their mistakes, become more transparent and responsible, and people move over towards them
When a bank fails, the government bails them out with taxpayer money. Then they lose all that money through continued incompetence. Then the government bails them out again. Over and over, just keep throwing money at them.
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:06:35
I used to think like that too, when the only bitcoin I had was whatever I mined
But like I said, just buy back what you spend, and you still get to save for when it "goes to the moon". You convert fiat to BTC, they convert it back to fiat.. that just gives BTC a lot of activity, and like someone else said, gives other people reason to consider accepting it.

There's an ongoing discussion of bitcoin on a forum I go to, and there's something I noticed about the people who speak out against it. Every single one of the profiles I looked at are under 30 years old, and the majority are between 18-22.
It's good that people this age are talking about economics at all, but it's interesting that the "pro government regulation" or "status quo" people are young. 
I need to put more thought into why this trend seems to be occurring, but I think some of it has to do with perspective. People in their 30's lived through an era when there was no internet, then the internet became a huge part of our lives, seemingly out of nowhere.  We lived through a true revolution, probably the biggest that has ever occurred in our history. 
Meanwhile, these people have had it all along. They were either in diapers or on the potty when this was happening, and when they were finally able to think for themselves, it was already there.
Another theory is that the most outspoken people simply regret not getting into it sooner, and feel like they 'missed the train'. They hear stories of contemporaries making tons of money doing "nothing" and just get jealous. And jealous backlash is what you'd expect from someone who is 18-22. 
For these people I try to explain that it is still "day 1" and it's absolutely not too late to get in (just don't risk more in something that is so new, and thus unstable and risky, than  you are willing to just completely lose)
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:31:24

Japan actually isn't nearly as 'high tech' as people think. Especially in how little it is used in every day life there.
The digital vs cash that you brought up is one aspect, but it goes beyond that. Basically every aspect of life there is "traditional" be it banking, utilities, digital service providers, advertising, etc. I spent 6 months there last year, and it was like going back in time in many aspects.

I remember that discussion, and afterward when Seaman asked "so are you ready to get into bitcoin" or something like that, Joe laughs and goes "After that? NO WAY!"

What you are doing using BTC on namecheap is adding credit to your account.  You can't actually **buy** anything until the transactions go through. So you have a good idea for a domain, it's actually available, then you have to wait over an hour to actually get it.

For $1000, paypal would get about $30, and Bitpay would get $10
For me, the main advantage is not having to worry about the customer getting the product, then doing a chargeback later. The burden is entirely on the merchant in most cases, and a lot of the time the seller can basically lie and make a false claim.
With Bitcoin, once they spend the money, it's gone, and they aren't getting it back. Of course that means you have to be EXTREMELY trustworthy as a merchant.

It might be a bit late for anyone considering getting into GPU mining, but maybe most people wouldn't realize that before reading into it some more... Hopefully it helps some! IMO it's still somewhat feasible to GPU mine, but not for long.

This is a perfect example of how things are in China. They really clamp down on their peoples' rights, as we all know. But that is only on a large scale. Rights, freedoms, etc.
On a smaller scale, China is much more "wild west". Things like this are not uncommon. It is VERY common for banks to have people trading foreign currencies in large amounts under the table, as there is normally a very short limit as to how much one can trade.
What I have noticed is, China has very strict rules and laws, but they only really seem to enforce them when they directly threaten the state or government itself. When it comes to everything from breaking currency exchange laws, to flat out driving on the wrong side of the road, the authorities turn a blind eye.

The way I see it, it's not "good" news.. but it's not the worst news either. It's sort of what anyone familiar with China would have expected.
They will be the LAST country to ever fully adopt bitcoin as a currency, not the first. And if anything, they would be the FIRST country to try to put an end to it completely. The fact that they didn't do this is the 'best' news in the release.
However the fact that they want to regulate it as part of "the internet" means they will have the means to effectively end its use in their country if they ever decide to do so.

I am far more concerned about a big reaction from China than I am about any other country. If USA finally decides they don't want Bitcoin to be viable, they will try to work against the largest exchanges with law.. and would likely fail.
If China does they same, they can literally take everyone who works for these big exchanges, and make it so they are never seen or heard from again.

I bought my most recent domain from them using bitcoin as well. Only thing I didn't like was having to wait 70 minutes for the confirmations to go through. It would suck to lose the domain during that time!
Edit: To make it clear, you don't actually buy the domain with bitcoin, you are adding credit to your account. After that goes through, you can then buy your domain. So unless you add a bunch of credit to your account at once, you have to wait over an hour each time you want to get a domain there.
