Of course we already knew the name used on the original paper (Satoshi Nakamoto), but no one had any idea who that actually was.

1. the QR code lets people scan it with their phone using a bitcoin wallet app to easily send you btc rather than entering the address manually
2. mining is the creation of new blocks, which contain a list of all bitcoin transactions occuring after the previous block. the block is then added to the block chain. one block is created globally approximately every 10 minutes. the miner creating the block will be rewarded 25 bitcoin.
3. an exchange's website or  (prices vary across exchanges)
4. blockchain.info serves to list addresses/transactions/balances. you need to buy bitcoin from a service such as coinbase or an exchange like bitstamp

i don't think so, if the competing crypto had a different hashing algorithm (which they would for this very reason)  bitcoin asics would be useless.

keep in mind theres a lot more leeway in what you can afford to lose for a young single guy v guy with 3 kids supporting a family...
sounds like you could afford to lose that 10K
that said i still dont think going all in is a good idea. too much emotional investment leading to stupid decisions

Hey fuck you, guy.
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:59:33
I had success with 3.7.2 but what you said applies to cgminer-3.8.4
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:59:22
try this 
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:58:40
you would use some tool that decrypts BIP38 encryption then import the decrypted private key
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:35:45
if you are with NAB i recommend coinjar.io, they allow internet transfers for nab customers.
to buy bitcoins you need to 1. deposit money to the exchange, then when that's done 2. buy at current exchange rate
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:48:56
6.392 days
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:31:33
alright... but how does it work if i say bought 10 total, but at various prices then sold just a few, also at different prices?
much confuse
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:09:41
do you live under a rock or something?
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:11:44
I use coinjar. I've made quite a few deposits/buys through them over time with no issues at all using internet transfer.
Having concern who you hand your ID to is a good thing but I don't think you need to worry.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:27:53
so what are the different aspects...
1. the protocol, how it works etc... learn this in a day or two depending on your background
2. the 'news'... who is saying what about bitcoin... kinda interesting i guess but boringly predicable (general public perception still negative but slowly but surely improving).
3. adoption.. again just  steadily improving... kinda boring
4. political implications.. probably the most important part and the whole purpose of its existence.
5. bitcoin markets... hours a week of entertainment 
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:18:46


No, you need to export the private keys.
Tools -&gt; Export private keys in Multibit. Make sure to password protect. Then store a couple of backup copies somewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:34:58
To buy, you would scan the recievers public address QR code with your coin base app or something with a wallet containing btc. Knowing their public address doesn't let you spend their coins, you need their private key for that
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:45:48


I have no doubt that this is happening, and happened ~ 2 hours ago.
Just don't be a panic selling sucker.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:36:55
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:49:32
you could try not selling then re-buying a few minutes later at the same price...
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:35:57
most people wont care and dont bother with anything until its well and truly mainstream. just enjoy the benefits of adopting early, you will find some people that are actually interested beyond the $$ value
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:37:41


They would not do this because they would lose a fuckload of wealth.
Also there's no insider information because there is no "inside"
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:05:04
Not really, the blockchain (which lists all BTC transactions ever made) has been publc (it has to be by design), from day 1. All addresses are visible on it along with their balances. The only way bitcoins exist are as a transaction on the blockchain. If theres no transaction, there's no bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:42:19
yeah, whatever is a relatively "large" sell order on any exchange will always drive the price down.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:13:51
if we had faith in bitcoin, why on earth would we go for other alternative copy cats instead? :s
ill tell you: people feel like they missed the boat with BTC and want to jump on the next big thing
whether or not any will succeed i dont know, but im staying away. just seems tacky
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:00:47
yeah at this price it needs to be at least $20 difference depending on the exchange to be worth the trade
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:45:06
That's a fact, is it?
The arrogance of some in this sub is worrying. I very much believe in bitcoin but what you just said is still a long way from being fact.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:26:54
Yeah same thing happened to me. I had sent a coin or 2 to my web wallet, a day later looked the address up on blockchain and just see another transaction sending the rest of my coins to some other address. I was just sitting there stunned for about a minute until i remembered about change addresses.
I still do half assed "offline" storage in electrum that occasionally access the internet though (just when im sending coins), being an encrypted linux partition helps
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:39:35
I am certain that the price will either go up or go down very soon.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:41:48
So long as it's encrypted it's fine...  Obviously these weren't though
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:05:25
this shouldnt be an issue if paypal weren't so hopeless. its so easy to prove that the bitcoin transfer actually took place. but no, all the buyer has to do is say "reverse plz" and they get their money back.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:52:31
I see, so the price went up in both timelines so therefore they will follow the exact same path.
You, sir, are a financial genius.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:10:56
i agree there are some nutters in this sub but i'm going to go ahead and hope they are a vocal minority
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:45:48
depends if you made the paper wallet with encryption or not
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:29:39
most likely it was someone that had sent you a transaction already, there's basically no chance of incorrectly sending BTC as the result of a typo or something
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:44:33
Thanks for the info, O wise one
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:04:41
it was from web wallets on cryptsy
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:19:37
no, they just sold a lot of coins which filled bids down to 1k due to btc-e having very low volume
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:52:49


dont do this. coins should only spent from an address once for security reasons.
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:18:05


*Contains the private key/public address to access the coins in the blockchain
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:20:31
Second this. Mostly instant deposits/buys after your first deposit, they are doing well. (via NAB internet transfer)
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:11:27
transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:05:38
if someone was even going to attempt cracking a public address they would probably start at satoshi's
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:56:58
for there to be a seller there has to be a buyer. crashes are basically caused by a shitload of selling to any bid possible regardless of price
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:09:58
If there's any signifcant amount on there i'm sure a pro would be able to recover it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:05:14
Your private key will be stored on their servers, you won't be able to see it.
Only way to see your own private keys are when you create your own wallet with clients like bitcoin-qt, electrum etc. if you have a significant amount the majority shouldn't be stored on web wallets like coin base because they aren't truly yours unless only you have access to the private keys
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:14:09
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:35:29
its a fixed amount and voluntary (depending on your client). Higher fee will result in your transaction being quicker, no fee may take a long time).
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:00:52
use bitpay and payments are instantly converted to USD on the merchant side
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:58:48
Oh I do have that, I'm thinking of attacks that combine keylogging to get the wallet password 
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:48:54


Someone's having regrets cashing out at $250 it sounds like!
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:47:49
nobody owns or controls Bitcoin. It's open source
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:45:50
short answer: no
long answer: when you recieve "bitcoin" at an address all that actually happens is that a transaction to your address is registered in a block on the blockchain, which will exist on all running bitcoin nodes. when you spend those bitcoin (you will need to be online to do this) another transaction is recorded showing the coin going to another address
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:07:10
probably the fact that coinjar is AUD only and btc-e doesn't support AUD
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:30:48
Bitcoin QT downloads the entire blockchains. There are lightweight clients like Multibit that does not do this.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:55:22
reference number in the message i would think solves this

i'm about to go there and i'd definitely stay there if he does!
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:23:27
because they are doing it for attention, not payment? paying them makes it more degrading than it already is
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:03:33
maybe if you are one of those with delusions of bitcoin being a 100% guaranteed shortcut to retirement, you might be able to draw similarities because if everything thinks that way its destined to fail. but most realise that they are putting a bet on a new technology which may or may not succeed so your comparison doesnt really work.
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:05:23
Ask the ass he pulled it from.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:33:17
coinjar.io is pretty easy
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:25:28
my strategy: buy as much as i can afford to lose
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:17:14

i also have half a bitcoin sitting in the depths of gox i sent to make a payment waiting to be verified. all you can do is wait
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:02:47
girls in CS are pretty rare last time i checked
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:27:51
transactions and addresses are public yes, but your actual identity isn't really tied to those addresses, and every transaction basically uses different addresses so an individuals total balance isnt visible.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:11:00
2k sell, how cute
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:26:25
that fucking sucks... using encrypted desktop wallet and you still got owned. very unlucky.
any idea how? has to be a keylogger on your computer combined with them somehow getting your wallet file
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:21:18
"i have tits! give me free things!"
no thx
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:34:05
Checks are made to make sure it's a valid address (some of the characters in the address are checksum). Client will reject it.
The probability of a mistyped address being valid is like 1 in 4 billion
@_date: 2013-11-22 04:23:12
lol what? bitcoin isn't a stock
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:36:12
Yes, it's highly recommended to send bitcoins to an offline wallet from your web wallet
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:45:35
That's fine just make sure you have multiple copies in case you lose the USB or it stops working. 
I have that and an encrypted wallet backup on google drive
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:23:04
nah its 10 bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:41:29
1. the sign wasnt actually meant for his mom, obviously
2. no ones going to advertise their bank account details on national TV
its a good example of how easy btc is to use. hopefully one day changing back to dollars will not be necessary

@_date: 2013-11-24 22:25:40
My security strategy isn't reliant on that assumption so i'm not too worried. I don't spend any coins from that wallet (i have pocket change on web wallet) and if i ever do i will have moved it to a completely cold storage machine. The chances of my host machine being infected are pretty small anyway.
I'm not too keen on paper wallets atm but maybe i'll come around to the idea...
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:13:10
I would only be entering the password on the VM and any input there isn't sent to the host at all 
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:52:36
you need to have an internet connection to install packages that way.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:36:33
why would they have to be an "idiot"? i would think a smart person would have a similar chance!
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:52:38
Coinjar has an iphone app for their web wallet
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:04:58
Goes both ways, it could have dropped $100 and you would be very happy about the delay right now.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:52:47
i've done at least 10 deposits over the last year and only one other than the initial took longer than half an hour... weird
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:08:59
thanks for the advices 
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:14:50
also good idea to note that the eight decimal place limit can be changed
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:52:28
That's not the issue, it's to do with the limit on block sizes and the fact they are created once every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:52:16
only one will be verified by the blockchain, however both may show as "unconfirmed" transactions for a period of time
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:00:16
Bank transfer takes like 5 mins for NAB customers
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:33:50
yeah, everytime you send coins from an address electrum will empty it and send to a different address in your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:31:04
no it didnt
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:18:35
it's all yours just paste your address. it's only there due to my own ocd of having a round amount in storage aha
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:12:02
See murbul's answer, explains it better than I can.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:59:38
what did you use to open it? bitcoin-qt?
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:46:47
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:30:21
putting 'she' first is equality now, even though its 99% more likely satoshi is male...
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:27:15
I'm wondering the same thing. If All I have sold for $$ is basically my initial investment, does that count as capital gain?
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:27:01
thats basically when people mined/bought lots of bitcoin very early on when it was very easy to come by and cheap because not many people knew about it/wanted them. as demand has increased significantly since then as bitcoin adoption grows, the dollar value of the coins they have has risen dramatically.
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:26:13
it goes to the deposit address which is unique to your account so that gox knows its from you, then transfers it to one of their main storage addresses
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:35
bear trap
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:29:01
Using coinjar also. 
Once the coins come into my coinjar wallet i immediately send them to my desktop wallet (i use multibit). Make sure you password protect and export/back up the private keys for the wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:12:10
i have 0.0044 in an online wallet. this was meant to be
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:22:44
a negative outcome was expected so probably wouldn't have had an effect. a positive one just adds to the optimism.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:46:48
yep i actually did this since posting on a linux VM
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:26:01
In multibit you can export the private keys which you can store somewhere else as a backup, whether it be on another USB or cloud storage etc 
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:23:28
willful ignorance? do you want me to survey the entire bitcoin userbase or something?
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:10:53
Good stuff. Hopefully in the future $423 will be the new $10 ;)
I think they are still underpriced.

@_date: 2013-11-25 22:08:27
At the mt gox checkout it asks to confirm payment and provide a change address (where extra btc is sent back to), I press submit and it just clears the forms on the page and doesn't do anything 
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:59:53
In april it was $200, it's now $1000. to the moon?!
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:12:48
i identified this as a potential problem as soon as i opened multibit for the first time... need to be extra careful
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:07:48
true but retiring at 30 means you need a lot more savings than someone 60+ of course...
not saying its not possible, you could probably backpack SEA for the rest of your days with 150k.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:21:45
Correct. 
I don't think a rate change is likely, I'm sure block size will be increased when necessary
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:07:48
its supply AND demand, not just supply
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:36:15
Well said mate! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:58:36


in other words you could earn a 60k salary for 6 years then retire? how do you figure?
these days 2 mil would be minimum retirement money if you plan on having a family, 1 mil otherwise...
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:08:41


They were saying that at $1, $20, $100... etc
Adoption and recognition has increased dramatically in the past month, and the price has followed accordingly
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:48:14
someone has no bitcoins... how embarrassing!
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:13:15
50 btc every 10 mins, halving every four years. It's 25 btc/10 min at the moment
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:53:40
I think he's saying idiots need to stop freaking out and panicking every time the price makes a move
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:32:22
Use coinjar
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:29:39
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:21:55
it's currently changed manually but there are plans to implement the scaling you speak of
@_date: 2013-11-15 05:59:07
It's just a prefix so you can tell what's an address, what's a private key etc
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:11:09


how so?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:52:22
what was the bug? some users just had an extra 60BTC in their account?
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:02:41
so i just checked back and they changed to bitpay
just made my first buy with btc! so easy
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:26:14
yes, they would have access to it, but the real problem here is the thief somehow knowing your password.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:42:32
try now ;)
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:39:19
unless its a brainwallet (which it isnt), the private keys will only be found inside your wallet.dat (although some clients let you export the private keys to a .key to back up). so they would have had to have somehow got that and the password.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:32:27
true but only valid if bitcoin completely replaces other currencies. the argument is that its better than to spend your inflating dollar rather than a deflating bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:05:48
He's the guy from Happy Gilmore
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:50:04
why, so i can panic sell during price corrections? no thx
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:38:48
There will always be someone willing to sell at the right price.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:35:32
still saying 1.1% to me
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:00:13
 Quantum computing would mean the end of bitcoin as we know it (as well as everything else relying on current encryption techniques) because quantum algorithms have already been developed that would break public key cryptography.
Certainly not going to happen anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:10:31
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:04:57
Yeah I do get that the VMs are designed to isolate the host from the guest but it's still far better than running on windows directly. I don't really have a seperate machine to dedicate to btc at this time
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:02:33
learning what bitcoin actually is will help you answer those questions yourself. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:34:14
1. if your wallet doesnt have password encryption, dont use it
2. dont store your private key anywhere electronically unencrypted
i definitely wouldnt recommend storing all your coins on an android wallet. keep the majority in electrum (write down the seed and you can restore it from that only). keep spending money in the android wallet address 
there's no danger in your public address being known. private key is needed to spend


you need to backup your private key, not the public address
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:39:45
It's maturing. The price will continue to rise at it continues to. I don't know how you could think it would just stay at 100. From there it was always going to go up or go down dramatically.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:05:31
and/or the ~5 other similar entries on the new queue at any given time!
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:06:18
the time of turning $500 to $50000 in a year is well and truly over. bitcoin is not some get rich thing right now.
a huge increase in real world usage and infrastructure will need to happen before we see anymore huge increases in price. and whether this even happens or not is unknown.
you don't need to buy entire coins. get yourself some income and just buy what you can every 2 weeks or so.
@_date: 2013-11-12 12:00:04
Damn, I'm visiting there next month and thought id be able to use bitcoin there for some things at least. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:34:47
I use electrum. Multibit used to send change back to the original address, did they change that? It's not something built into the bitcoin protocol, just a practice most clients seem to implement.
I think the purpose is to make it impossible to monitor/track someones BTC balances, as the reciever and your "change address" are indistinguishable on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:16:32
"convenience fee"
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:03:30
confirmation times are dependant on block creation times which are fixed at every 10 mins on average by design
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:14:24
I was sure you can't specify your own seed? Letting users choose their own is a bad idea
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:07:17
well that's weird
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:12:14
it will probably either rise or fall a smallish amount. i wouldn't expect it to be very significant.

No, wrong.
Try again taking into account the 60k in interest you would be earning every year, compounding
1 mil is easily enough to retire if managed correctly.

some people sold lots of coins

flip a coin
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:01:50
actually i can transfer money, buy BTC then withdraw the btc from coinjar in probably 10 mins total, seems far better than the coinbase, gox etc stories i see here

Yes. Also keep in mind bitcoin-qt will run as a node and therefore has to dowload the entire block chain (can take a fair while). Instead check out multibit or electrum which are more lightweight. Encrypt and back up the wallet. also!

mainly because it takes months to withdraw USD from gox.

 i just can't imagine why a hacker would encrypt your wallet themselves rather than send the BTC to their own address (you could have a private key backup etc). i would say its more likely you set a password and forgot you did it?

1 each exchange differs in their withdrawal processing time, the most expensive takes months to withdraw USD
2  if you want to wait months for your $$, sure
4  depends, if you want to sell at market value should be instant
5 selling btc will give you a $$ balance on the exchange which you then need to withdraw to your bank, so basically yes
6 duno
7 if theres a price it means someone is probably willing to buy at that price
8 supply and demand based on speculation (even more so than btc)

unless you have free electricity it will cost you more than you earn

This raises the idea of using bitcoin as a store of value that the bloodsuckers you speak of can never get their grubby hands on when they decide to check out on their marriages for their cash prize.

Nah, if it dropped THAT low there would be a very, very good reason for it.

So say I have a btc wallet on my desktop. How do I go to a physical store and pay btc?
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:20:39
im trying to buy something but the mtgox payment thing is being a piece of shit, wow i am mad
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:21:16
look for wallet.dat file
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:42:02
they call that a "stop loss" or "stop limit". 
try searching those terms in relation to bitcoin exchanges, im not sure if they implement it
