Everyone in this sub will cheer you on, but this is simply 'putting your life savings in' on an extremely high risk/reward game.
Sure, you might get rich. You might be able to travel for a few months/years. Shit might also hit the fan and you'll be back home (with no home) and no money.
Well, at least you had fun. Hopefully ;)

I just got my first Bitcoins this afternoon. I payed 50 EUR and got about 37 EUR in BTC value. 
Can anyone ELI5/explain me how I can not pay such insane fees?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:31:45
This is fucking dumb. Most of the supportive comments are also dumb. You all sound like 16 year olds convinced on winning. This gives a bad rep to this sub and the whole crypto currency.
Maybe he will be rich in 3 years, but it's still pure gambling at this point. He might as well take 100k to the casino and put it on black.
Edit: in response to the 100k invested guy.

Came there via one of the stickied topics around here. They were fast and I could use a local payment, which was nice. But all the fees I come across seem so extreme.

It's doesn't just suck, it's actually something that makes the whole currency extremely unstable. People won't be buying anything with Bitcoin for weeks or months until the dust settles.
The more people see Bitcoin as an investment rather than a currency, the bigger the bubble is.

I mean, in the end it will level out somewhere. Kilo-calories are almost always referred to as calories, Bitcoin will be similar but maybe only after the dust has settled.
As for Jane Doe wanting Bitcoin, it's extremely difficult and technical as it is. I don't think using different terms (mBTC) will solve that or make it more complicated. With the various crypto-currencies out there, I'm still confused about BitcoinCash (is it the same as BTC?) and using mBTC and other terms will absolutely confuse new people. It's way easier to explain you can buy 0.00x Bitcoin, than giving every zero behind the comma a different name.
I recently bought my first few BTC, and even being tech-savvy and a webdesigner by trade it was (and still is) extremely confusing. My parents would never be able to buy BTC without outside help, that is something that needs serious fixing before it can be used as a currency, rather than an investment for a bunch of nerds and traders.

Your life's motto should be to have as little debt as possible. I'd honestly only consider it for buying a house. I'd rather drive a piece of shit car than ~~buy~~ borrow one with the banks money for 10-40k.

I just dipped my toe into all his. I payed 13 EUR for a 50 EUR transaction, seems awfully high? I'm not too bothered because i'll just leave it sit there for a while, but are there better/cheaper ways to acquire more?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:10:37
Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:37:10
How do you know they are giving away 95%?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:03:56
I thought bitcoin was to supposed to be a  decentralized currency, not an investment to make money?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:19:39
**You would, or should.** It would make it an impossibly expensive currency, which would mean it's demise. 
BTC only has value if it's (one day) seen as a viable alternative for other currencies. Ridiculously high fees will quickly kill that future.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:54:20
Fees for transactions, ATM, credit card payments etc. are very high to begin with in the US.
In the Netherlands you can wire money (between your own bank) for free, instantly via a simple app.
For other Banks it takes one day, but they are working on making that instant too, again: free. If you make a payment request and it's being payed, you get the confirmation immidiately.
3,5% for relatively low amounts is absolutely insane. The Bitcoin currency will not survive if this is not fixed. Not to mention all the other problems with the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:04
In reference to which part? The naming of the decimal-bitcoin or acquiring Bitcoin in general?
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:38:18
Internet is actually a basic human right in the Netherlands.

€250, only invest what you're ready to lose
@_date: 2018-08-02 11:19:56
Oh, I havent done the calculations. Might as well be 10k or a million, it's fine either way.
I just 'invested' for FOMO, I may have been late to the party, I may have been early. Only time will tell. €250 was worth the FOMO for me, regardless of the outcome. I could have invested much more, but I don't trust Bitcoin enough for that.
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:47:00
I bought €250 at 14k, I rarely look at bitcoin price nowadays. I just wanted to make sure I was the one "if you bought 250 at 15k you'd have 300k now" in 2035.
If I lose my 250 I don't really care either way. If bitcoin becomes stagnant at 10k it wasn't meant to be anyway.

Til I'm doing alright but I still feel poor

I know CC fees and stuff in the US are already ridiculously high, but in Europe (Netherlands) it's virtually free and instant to wire money - even to differently branded banks.
If Bitcoin wants to compete with these systems the:
* Fees need to be reduced to almost zero, or max a few cents per transaction (BTC &lt;&gt; BTC at least)
* Transactions have to be virtually instant
* Apps/wallets need to be way more modern and easy accessible, also for tech-illiterate people
If you forget the added value of Bitcoin that is decentralisation, there is currently literally no reason to use Bitcoin as a currency. In fact, it's horrible as a currency.
I don't understand why not more people (here) are worried about this.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:38:08
Shorted from 11k to 9500. Too bad my app won't allow me to buy on 9500 for some reason.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:44:11
Unfortunately they have a cap on buying Bitcoin at the moment. Not sure how that works exactly. Seems like you can short it though :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:27
Not sure how the details work, but I use an app called Bux (Dutch project) where it's listed as currency. I didn't buy the actual Bitcoin.
I'm only playing a bit, no big money anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:02:51
Bought 50 euro's worth of Bitcoin around 11k for funsies. Expecting a massive drop any time now.
