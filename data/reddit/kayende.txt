So supply isn't finite afterall?

I agree, but that is not the logic I am disputing.
Lets say you increase the available bitcoins to 210 million and in the same stroke increase any holdings by a factor 10 so that everyone has the same percentual part of the total as they did before the increase. Now, in theory, the lowest possible unit is worth one tenth as much, everyone's holdings have the same value and there is room for the value to increase because the lowest unit has less value.
If you open another decimal at the end, in theory, the lowest possible unit is worth one tenth as much, everyone's holdings have the same value and there is room for the value to increase because the lowest unit has less value.
So the two options produce the same results as far as I can see. There might be a flaw in my logic, but I can't see it. I understand you are downvoting because you don't like the skepticism in my question, but I am really only asking so that someone can point to where my logic fails.

I cant understand how adding a decimal after the comma isn't equivalent to increasing the available amout by a factor 10.

But I can still install BTC1 after the split, and keep the same bitcoins on both chains from the same wallet keys, right? If this is correct, I do not see the drama. Just allow a day or two to resync the other client.
EDIT: My understanding is that as long as i have my wallet.dat, I am safe?

...if the segwit2x chain ends up being the main chain. (not saying anything about the probabilities other than it is not for sure before we get there.)
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:30:38
As in there will be no 2x, or as in core will also comply to 2x?
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:43:51
because people are on core wallet and the NYA chain does not contain enough transactions to mine. This would make it unprofitable to mine on that chain, no?

Follow-up on 3: If i choose to be on core after split it will still be only a matter of downloading BTC1 and synching the new chain, right?

Most relevant questions for a non-literate hodler noob:
1. Is there any scenario where I lose all my coins without my own action?
2. Can I keep using core wallet?
3. Does BIP91 automatically lead to hardfork, or is there another consesus for NYA 2MB?

No, you don't have to morally support them. But if you buy your bitcoin with fiat currency, you are indirectly supporting money laundering by providing a way to transfer revenues from potentially illegal activities (we all know that some illegal activities are relatively common with bitcoin). I personally own bitcoin because I find the concept technologically and ethically interesting.

Well, that is not how I see it.
I was just saying bitcoin does not have regulatory mechanisms of reporting and controlling in place, making trading easy for "shady business". The "regular economy" has some mechanisms in place to counter illegal activities, bitcoin does not. Even if bitcoin has other risks, this will shift parts of illegal business to bitcoin in amounts not proportional to the total size of the bitcoin economy.
I am not trying to undermine bitcoin or it's integrity. As I said, I own bitcoin myself and I do believe there are uses for bitcoin which would be considered by "the society" to be both relevant and legitimate. I am just trying to make observations about the nature of the bitcoin economy in relation to the established traditional economy. If my usage of the terms "illegal" and "money laundry" offends you, I am sorry, but I think this is going to be how the establishment will observe bitcoin.

Then we agree. And this is why I made the statement in the first post that you don't have to morally support money laundry even if using bitcoin. However you run a bigger "risk" of supporting it fiscally by investing fiat currency in it. It would seem our discussion comes down to interpretation of the word "support".
