The basic idea (adding, modifying, deleting) parts of the proposed language of the laws is actually happening - that's what legislation is all about. The fundamental difference is, that only people with special  power (the law makers) do it - not the public. While Github is an excellent, effective technical tool to get this process done by the public - Github can not fork the public into law makers. Without the public acquiring real law maker power, this exercise is interesting, but not actual law making.

The beauty of this fine was that it was not based on treaties - it was based on unilateral US political economic sanctions that restrict trade with Cuba, Iran, Sudan. The New York office of BNP did not obey these sanctions and allegedly falsified documents.

If the New York licensing becomes a broiler template for other jurisdictions, they will just modify it to the local currency.
The biggest danger in this piece of the proposed legislation is that it is proposing to force back BTC to fiat. 
Forcing BTC back to fiat is aimed to slow down the development of the self-contained, truly independent bitcoin ecosystem and enforcing the supreme role of fiat. 
Basically attempts to maintain the current status quo, where BTC is just a round-trip from fiat-BTC-fiat, literally limiting the role of BTC to a method of payment, instead of independent currency.

Yes, it's domestic, maybe only Canadian, I can not verify that.
 
Not necessarily middle class, though - you can probably get this with no or low-fee fiat checking accounts. 
BTC does it for cheaper, of course, my point was that if we start adding different fees on top of the basic BTC transfer fee, for value added services, we have to be careful, how they all add up, because banks have started to create lower priced, faster services. 
Interac is actually international, probably they could start international transactions - the biggest hurdle would be the exchange rate between different fiat currencies, as most bank accounts are in the local fiat currency. 
When BTC gets more market share, the competition will most likely flare up, unless banks will just return to their original function: landing.

It would be an outstanding way to involve the broader public to exercise democracy, but it would require fundamental change in power structure. Historically it does not happen without continuous. relentless fight. Law makers won't hand over law making privileges without a pressure that would make them impossible to refuse the change. My point is that this is not a "technological" issue, it is fundamentally a political power issue. The pressing question really is, how to obtain and extend the legislative power to the public.

When you buy BTC you re putting your money where your mouth is already, taking risk. 
Now the rubber really starts to hit the road - you are minimizing your risk if BTC has the proper monetary power to influence legislation, or the avoidance of legislation.
The fiat rich nations are where regulators will try hardest to neutralize BTC as much as possible. 
Dreaming about BTC becoming a solely black market commodity/currency at this stage is naive, BTC is flying way above the radar.

They were quite surprised and liked the personal touch, that I created a vanity wallet with their nick names.
It also gave me an opportunity to talk a bit about the importance of taking risk, pushing limits and look out and show appreciation for potential game changing innovations, ideas. 
Finally, I could also use BTC to demonstrate, that if your gut and logic tells you the same thing, at one point you should put your money where your mouth is.

Chances are that governments will want to control monetary policy "manually" (politically), as opposed to let math do the decisions for them. 
That would mean for governments to give up the crucially important power to willfully control wealth distribution.
I see this part by far the biggest hurdle in the future of Bitcoin.
Although the political slogan in all developed countries is "free market economy" - it is only free, as long as the political elite is free to set the rules. Including monetary policies.
The technical ingenuity of Bitcoin is that it is a platform, that allows to bypass this nation state government power and control, by connecting citizens directly, anywhere around the globe to vote about the price of a mutually accepted, therefore existing currency, that they can use among each other to trade goods and services - purely on the value that is determined across the globe, real time, by them, the participating individual citizens.
The implication of this is hard to overestimate.

Obviously, the Dallas Buyers Club for BTC is a parody, writing about a potential loophole.
On the other hand, just to further explore the theoretical loophole: in case of a refund you get equivalent value, there is no profit involved. 
There is no concealing the source of income, and as you pointed out, refund is not an income.

It is not a conspiracy theory, it is a commonly used tactic.
But it gives the opportunity to think it through, fight it all the way where it needs to be changed. It is part of lawmaking - but in case of other laws different interests have well established representation, the lawmaker does not turn to Reddit.
BTC does not have established representation - it is our duty, as individuals to voice our concerns and try to get our views into the language of the law.

It is not accident that the first American BTC regulation is happening at the home of Wall Street, where regulators are the most in-tune with the financial industry in every sense. 
That's where the financial industry can lobby regulators the most effectively. They don't want to leave time for any other jurisdiction to create precedent making regulations.
Once the NY regulation is passed, it will serve as a broiler plate for other states and for federal regulations in the US and possibly in G20 countries, which tightly co-ordinate their financial, banking systems.

Interac etransfer is a major competitor now for fast an cheap money transfer from fiat accounts. 
I recently used it and it was surprisingly simple, fast and inexpensive. 
In case if you have not used it: you initiate a transaction online from your bank account, sending money to an email address. When you send the money you also set up a security question - reply. You receive the email almost instantly, select the bank and account you want to deposit, answer the security question and the funds are transferred an immediately available, without hold.
The maximum amount to transfer is $3000, the fee $1.50. 
I think this is the biggest current money transfer competition to BTC today. All combined BTC transaction fees should compete with this price, not with wire transfer fees.

Yes - thank you for the link. It was a great talk, fascinating history and technology. 
It was interesting, how Linus handed over "law maker" power to the developer community - but this is unprecedented in current political structure, with the real power concentrated in the hand of the de facto law makers.
The only way to get any piece of that pie is through political organization and pressure. That's is basically my point, just because these technologies exist, they don't translate automatically to political power. Not recognizing this is a problem.
In a sense it is similar to BTC - which needed the public's relentless investment in mining, development and actually putting your fiat where your mouth is. Without all of this BTC would have folded. 
The same level of political resilience is required to influence the regulation of BTC. 
  
@_date: 2014-03-23 12:59:09

@_date: 2014-07-19 04:36:23
I am glad you understand the way how political influence works.
There are fundamental difficulties with lobbying for bitcoin:
1) BTC does not have a professional lobby organization and hired lobbyists
2) BTC does not have formal fundraising organization to support the professional lobby organization
3) Lobbying is a full time effort, not just occasional campaigns
4) BTC is against industries, which all have well financed, professionally organized lobby organizations, they hire the most influential lobbyists.
Bitcoin needs the same. 
Maybe some of the BTC transaction fees could be used for supporting a professional political lobby organization.
On top of that, BTC should build up the multinational infrastructure of social political lobbying, deployed in each country. It should target all local politicians, lawmakers, as you are suggesting.
BTC should create a social political network, which continues to demonstrate that BTC is above any national government, above any national legislation - since none of the governments and states had any role in creating, operating the entire bitcoin economy. 
All governments can do is to try to regulate the BTC fiat gateway, because governments created and control fiat.
The faster we get to the state where commerce remains within BTC and it is not going back and forth the fiat BTC gateway the less regulating power governments have.
The regulations are basically all around the fiat BTC gateway - even at the local bitcoin level, which is individuals trading among each other. This part of the regulation is probably the most absurd, as individuals can trade basically anything among each others, without the red tape of "know your client". It would be ridiculous to apply the proposed BTC legislation to selling gold by individuals.  
In a weird sense, the more absurd the regulation is, the less it can be enforced.

Although you may have spotless record of paying your bills on time, the history of your perfect credit is outside of the records of a banking system. 
Do you keep at least a credit card, paid off fully every month - in case you need to jump back into the banking system for loan?

Amazon has big$ contract with 3letter agencies. 
Compared to that the Bitstamp account is peanuts both financially and in terms of political connections.

There are pros and cons of this argument, it is a complex issue. 
But sometimes it is as simple as not minding to settle for a while, when it is no longer a bummer that you have to live in the same place.

In order to get BTC more to the masses there is a need for a dirty cheap, dirty simple, idiot proof and safe device to store bitcoins.
Ideally you would use mobile phone - but it is not safe.
Laptops are even worst.
Without some solution having bitcoins is a bit like dragging with you small, invisible gold coins, worrying not to get separated in a careless moment.

Yes, I was thinking Ethereum-like contracts - but again, not related to humans.
Literally a platform where individual AI entities "negotiate mutual existence" beyond their own individual form, to create more sophisticated AI structures, where blockchain gives the "environmental logic" of social existence.

The Feds will hoard it, waiting for the $1000 BTC :)

It would have nothing to do with payments related to humans - or for that matter, with humans in general.
