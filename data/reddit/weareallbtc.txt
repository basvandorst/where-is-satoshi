All praise is due to Satoshi, blessed be his holy name.

Lot's of talented developers and people in this space are being discredited by the Bitcoin Foundation. Gavin has kept bitcoin in a defacto permanent beta stage while introducing vulnerabilities.
It's like in USSR everyone asked well if we don't have the communists who will produce cars for us, who will feed us? 
Gavin is attempting to make it easy for grandma to use by killing any robust aspects of this ecosystem.

It is not a question of how but a question of when at this point. I can see bitcoin at $500,000 by 2025.

All praise is due to Satoshi and may peace be upon his messenger Gavin Andresen.

It not a free market when all coins under control by few hands and miners are manipulating the order books.

Dollar cost averaging is the most powerful strategy in Bitcoin.

Cody Wilson is a manifest heretic.
Gavin Bell would never sell out this community to Silicon Valley types.

Bitcoin is not a revolution it is a counter-revolution.
It returns back to voluntary local currencies not ones imposed by force and debt.

He derives his living from the foundation.
Gavin has done an excellent PR job portraying himself as an innocent hard working developer, when under the facade he is anything but. Gavin Bell introduced vulnerabilities into the protocol and has had no problem associating with very shady characters, not to mention the use of fake names.

This post made me teary eyed. You are about to embark on the virtual adventure of a lifetime participating in the most powerful bull market the world has ever witnessed. Bitcoin is real, Satoshi is real and Gavin is his messenger. 
Learn the concept of dollar cost averaging where you can get a great average price for your BTC. Try upping your buys as well instead of 20 dollars maybe 100 so you pay lower fees.

A rising price makes people want bitcoin it's as simple as that.

The Bitcoin Foundation used Mt.Gox as a proxy and conduit to exit their positions. 
After the sudden collapse which caught prominent members off guard such as Gavin Bell and Luke-Jr, shills moved onto the next exchange like vampires.
Roger Ver was already setting up his new cashout venue at Bitstamp after telling his flock to stay onboard Mt.Gox.

We need to fork the protocol and introduce a better reward system.
Miners can still receive transaction fees for working and a portion of the remaining reward needs to be lotto out to random adress's to have more widespread distribution. That way users have incentive to join network(lotto). This is nuts we have concentrated miners killing us and the price.

I'm pretty sure Gavin read my post when I called on him and the Foundation to step in and provide some confidence to this market.
Gavin thanks for listening to the community.

We are all early adopters.
