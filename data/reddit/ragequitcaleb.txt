If you really feel this way - buy a better crypto! Bitcoin is literally the worst crypto for sending money to some kid in Taiwan. Try out BCH or Dash.

Which one? In 2 weeks?

Buy alt coins. BTC is one of many.

What happens once mining ceases? Who will verify transactions?

I see this advice every time legislation we don't like comes up. You know what happened when I wrote Cory Gardner about net neutrality? I got a canned email response thanking me for my input but letting my know that he already has made up his mind on the issue. The response made it clear that he didn't even have a good understanding of what net neutrality is. I also got added to his campaign email list. Emailing your senator doesn't seem to do anything. They are the voice of money. Not the voice of the people.

feelsbadman. The whales are just profiting off us laymen trying to get in before its too late. I've done more emotional trades in the last week than I'd like to admit.

I started trading a few months ago and this has been my legacy :|

Doesn't this wall make BCH look weak though?

Leave a couple thousand next time!

It is now. We just have the fresh and hot memes here at reddit. Mainstream news atleast an hour behind!

I've had a trezor for a couple weeks now. Is that a good option? Just going to try to get 0.1 or so.
