I had $900 jam up in their ATM machine. They made the situation right. Good guys, just give them time to work with you.

I'm already here testing out the pizza. The drunk candy with a redd's apple ale is a perfect combo! Paid with bitcoin.
I brought some gifts from blockchain.info and bitpay to give out as door prizes.

The best ATM experience is currently the BitAccess machine at The Gold Spike near by. There is also another working RoboCoin at the mini mart next to the Travelodge on the strip, across from Aria.

Strippers are usually quite impressed when i show them how to buy a Starbucks Gyft card with bitcoin.

The more you reuse your seed/private key, especially on different oses and wallets software, the harder time you'll have identifying the source of theft IF it happens.

At 7 billion people on the planet, everyone's fair share of bitcoin is .003 bitcoins or 300,000 bits. At today's exchange rate, that's $0.77. Something to ponder.

They will be at the Hustler club tonight at 11pm. I will be there if anyone wants to join me for tacos on the inside and a wiener on the out.

Call these guys on the phone and order it through the parts department. Tell them to email you a bitpay invoice so you can pay in bitcoin. You'll probably have to get a manager on the phone to make it happen. They just started accepting bitcoin in the last couple days, so they may require some hand holding to get you through this.
