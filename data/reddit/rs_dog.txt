That is a good idea actually.

I always find posts on here about deducting losses on taxes, which assumes that people here haven't fully converted all their money into bitcoin yet, and we aren't living in a bitcoin utopia already to be disheartening.

Sorry for your loss. This is the future of money... wow. Disappointed. If this was a real bank storing your money they might give it to you back, but with bitcoins its gone forever unless someone wants to donate 20 btc to you...

Scarcity is not a good measure of value. There still has to be demand for those scarce items. If people "accept" bitcoin but only for the purpose of getting USD, then they really don't accept bitcoin. Bitcoin seems to be good at carrying value for both parties, but at the end of the day, people have to cover their expenses in local currency. People say it is convenient to carry bitcoin over USD, but what if I want to buy a soda? It is easier for me to transfer money to a btc account and then set up a whole network revolving around converting btc to local currency or should I should reach in my pocket and pull out a $5 bill? That is why bitcoin is dropping. It is a systemic problem.

Ayn Rand philosophy has been failing Bitcoin. There is no incentive for anyone to stop from the current status quo as it is in everyone's best interest. I never understood why the Ayn Rand book club took over Bitcoin in the first place.

Ghash.IO has a point. Why should they be punished for their success? The Ayn Rand book club is just mad there are no incentives for anyone to steer away from the status quo. Ayn Rand philosophies are idealistic at best. Bitcoin has a flaw that should be fixed.

Well, the value of the BTC economy in USD equivalents is in USD. Of course if you measure the BTC economy based on bitcoins you get a 1 to 1 ratio, lol.

This post is nonsense. Bitcoin doesn't inherently follow your beliefs. Nor do I believe you that bitcoin was created specifically to stroke your beliefs pleasantly. If people choose to act collectively that is also their choice. If it is in one's best interest, why wouldn't they? It is not in everyone's best interest to showcase as much individuality in actions as possible while running off a cliff.

I was looking at that and the investments seem okay on the surface at least, but the loans seem to carry a lot of currency fluctuation risk for both parties unless I am missing something?

Bitcoin suffers from many exchanges which is good in some ways but makes each exchange have low liquidity.

If he is polling 31% that isn't looking good if there are only two candidates. I wouldn't for for a Libertarian anyway getting tired of the Ayn Rand book club.

With a few people with a lot of money in bitcoin it would make sense to buy all this up to keep their even large amount of BTC at a higher price...? Why have the large stakeholders not been buying up en masse? 
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:01:12
Utility and price don't have to go hand and hand. That doesn't mean Bitcoin will have a lot of buying power in the future. I mean it could, but it could go either way.

There is another wall but it is at 320 on Bitstamp.

Russia seems like a hell hole to be honest.

No, I don't believe that is the reason. Without exchanges there would have been no way for the prices to reach their $1000+ highs since btc to btc transactions do not say anything about USD price. The fees create btc economic activity so that might be a positive actually, but if the owners take their share in USD and buy a Rolex in USD that probably helps fiat currencies such ad USD more than helping btc. Which is one of the ironies of BTC wealth helping the fiat currencies so many believe would be their replacement.

The only use it currenly has is to carry value until it is converted immediately into the local currency. Theoretically, this would lead to equal buying and selling pressure but because of the gap in the sell and buy price and the real time it takes to carry the value this has at least thus far caused downward pressure.

I felt he deserved it. If he didn't agree with the laws in place he should have sought to change them or move somewhere (if they were willing to take him) to someplace that would. Trying to throw one over the lawman was not the brightest idea ever.

As it currently stands BTC trades like gold or wheat. It trades as a commodity priced in a currency such as USD. There needs to be a need or desire for BTC as there is for wheat or else the price will go down.

Did you just make a false comparison between drug trafficking and institutional racism and genocide? Jokes on you. Makes you look bad. Almost didn't reply because logic was so bad. 
Also, he didn't have to run his business the way he did. He could have been a legal pot distributor in Colorado and still make a lot.

Why would I want to store value in bitcoin when I could just use a mix of currencies such as Yen, Euros, USD, etc? Certainly bitoin is no more stable. Also, just because something is scarce does not mean anything about demand, only supply. If nobody wants it then it won't matter that the supply is scarce. At least right now, there are coins being created every day that need to be absorbed to cover mining expenses, etc.

The US government does not have enough gold for a gold standard. When Nixon got us off the standard we were covering less than 40% of the outstanding bills with gold. Other countries do hold USD because of it's reserve status and a lot of commodities trade in USD. Even if the exchange rate drops, a run on the gold would still be very possible even will less valuable currency and in fact that did happen historically. That is why when everyone was getting off the gold standard, everyone pretty much left around the same time.

Try both. I prefer the modern game, but 2007 is fun too.

That was partly why everyone went off the standard. Some countries would abuse other's redeem policy when they did not back their own currency themselves. Also the practicality of backing money $1:$1 money: gold comes into question. They would run out if everyone wanted to redeem.
