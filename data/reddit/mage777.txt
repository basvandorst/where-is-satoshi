What I mean by this is that their banks are having a liquidity crises so fiat withdrawals are limited. Unemployment is also high in that country. My friend makes money online, gets paid in bitcoin and uses his Xapo card to pay for things like groceries. 
There's still a fiat conversion involved but bitcoin makes it possible for him to receive money in a country that's short on cash.

Yes, I think you may be correct on that. Although even debit transactions tend to have spending limits but that's not something that's unique to Greece. 
@_date: 2016-04-30 23:53:12
Yes that was a bit of a blanket statement. What I should have said was that I know some people in Greece who get paid in bitcoin online as their only source of income.  
I also use fiat since it's the accepted medium of exchange in our society yet feel that fractional reserve banking is fundamentally flawed. What attracted me to bitcoin is having a decentralized alternative that can actually send payments more efficiently.

Initially it takes time to learn new habits but now it takes me very little effort to keep things secure. How much time should any of us spend on learning anything? Think of the effort we all had to put in just to learn how to work a basic home computer. What about driving a car? Learning to read, walk, talk etc. 
Most of these tips are also good for basic computer security. How many people are getting screwed out of their money with the cryptolocker virus? What about identity theft and fraud? We're in a digital age and people need to adapt their habits in order to survive. 
Bitcoin is also a potential hedge for a diversified portfolio. I know people in Greece who don't even have the option of fiat right now and need to use bitcoin to survive.

Yes, I also use a dedicated hardware device. That said, when I first got into Bitcoin I was a windows user with little tech experience. I noticed that Linux was considered industry standard for Bitcoin security and switched to Ubuntu and never turned back.
I'm surprised that my comment got so many downvotes. I take this as a sign that there are many new users here because almost every bitcoin hack is Windows related. If you care about security and privacy then Windows is the absolute worst OS. 
I've never had a single problem using Linux, not 1 virus, no lag, nothing. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:50:38
Wow, sorry to hear that. The main problem is that you used Windows instead of Linux. Never use windows for bitcoin, regardless of how secure you think it is.

Great points! Ya, as far as consumer protection goes, this all comes down to the social contract, where individuals trade some of their liberties in exchange for protection.
With freedom comes a greater degree of responsibility. Children are protected but lack choice, whereas becoming an adult gives us more freedom and with that, the burden of solving our own problems. 
The flip side is that bitcoin offers "merchant protection" because of all the chargebacks and "friendly fraud".

Fair enough. My main passion for the blockchain is its potential for being a real solution for privacy and decentralization. That said after watching how far advanced spook surveillance technology has become I can't help but wonder if they can backdoor SHA-256 like they do with everything else? So my question is can blockchain technology truly redefine the internet allowing for greater privacy? I know there are projects like Storj x, Maid safe, TITAN etc. Do you think these systems have the potential to be effective for true privacy? I posted that video mainly for people that are unfamiliar with the depth in which this technology can go. Thanks

This is true and many are valid concerns. I wrote this to specifically address the rhetoric I hear in the media. 


I got it from wikiquote and it appears to be all over the internet. That being said, I'm open to being wrong if you can elaborate and provide a source. 


The church persecuted anyone who disagreed with their dogmas, a flat earth being on of them.


Then stop calling it a ponzi scheme. An apple is a round fruit but for simplicity's sake I'm calling it an orange. This isn't pedantic, I've given you accurate reasons why it's not a ponzi scheme. Rather than saying "it's similar", perhaps you can give me detailed reasons explaining your case.


 The media is filled with stories about bitcoin as it relates to the black market (silk road), child porn and funding ISIL. This argument is used constantly by media pundits, a google search will give you pages of news articles.


Ok then find me a proper definition of "backed". By that same logic bitcoin is "backed" by the Bitcoin economy. Sure, it's new and relatively small but it's still a rapidly growing multi-billion dollar industry.

Oh and most people get wealthy by investing in fiction (stocks, bonds etc) and then allocate their wealth into real substance. They use both.

This is history. The British decided to “free” the slaves on the Caribbean islands because it was decided that it would be cheaper to have them fend for themselves than to pay their costs of living. All slaves were to be registered name, height, sex etc. Many took the last name of their previous slave owners and were required to carry documents. Traditionally freemen were not required by the crown to carry papers or register their name and property. Since then we've all been gradually subverted into their registered slave system. If you take offense then it's not with me but with history. The problem is we've become so conditioned to living in a cage we forget what freedom actually is. Farm animals seek comfort and safety in their cages. So yes, it is a fact that micromanaging our freewill with regulation is a form of slavery.

"In addition, they found found that search spikes were early indicators of an imminent drop in its value but added that this did not act as a good predictor of the biggest falls in the value of bitcoins. "
Am I missing something here or is this an obvious contradiction?

I understand why you feel that way yet the bottom line for regulating cryptos is so the government can get their “pound of flesh” in tax revenue. Where was regulation when thousands of people lost their houses from securities fraud in 2008? In fact the government response was to give trillions in bailout which got divied up as bonuses. Regulation inevitably creates a two tiered system. Tight restrictions on the masses and special privileges for the elite. HSBC gets busted laundering billions for mexican drug cartels and all they get is a slap on the wrist with a fine. Look up the Contra scandal; multiple criminal charges and not a single day of prison for the culprits. Oh but if we need regulation to prevent money laundering... well that's because the CIA hates competition.

The only politician I ever thought made logical sense was Ron Paul. I called b.s. when people were starry eyed with Obama and I call b.s. on Trump as well. Taxation by nature is just a form of extortion and people shouldn't have to pay for their leaders to live a life of luxury. 
Politicians play favourites based on American business interests. Destabalizing regimes like Iraq,Syria and Libya caused most of these guerrilla terrorist groups. The U.S. has always favoured Saudi Arabia and Israel due to ongoing business relations. The CIA has backed coups and tyrants for years, for economic and politcal gains. 
Saudi Arabia is full of Islamic extremism and oppressive human rights violations but they get a pass due to their 30,000 Billionaire oligarch princes. Especially the one's who buy $40M properties from Trump. The U.S. is notorious for its crony capitalism and revolving door policies. People on both sides of the spectrum left vs right are being played like instruments and cherry pick their facts to suit their confirmation bias. The same companies hedge their bets by backing both sides of the political fight so it's an ultimate win/win for the true power brokers.

It doesn't appear that anyone can legitimately answer my questions. Your counterargument is a false dichotomy that doesn't address a single concern of mine. People seem to think that pointing out Hillary and Obama's corruption legitimizes Trump or any of these new policies. 
That said. I'll take to time to answer each of your questions: 
1. I think she broke the law and was let off the hook because she's a part of a ruling oligarchy. I think Trump was putting on a good show and reneged on putting her on trial due to their long standing friendship. 
2. I think George Soros is corrupt and that agent provocateurs have been funded by governments and oligarchs for over a hundred years. 
3. I think if there is a secret paedophilia ring that they should all be persecuted and thrown in jail.
4. Same as above
5. I'm against censorship but also feel that people can legally run their websites anyway they want. If people take issue with this behaviour they are free to find other platforms or build their own. 
6. Same as above
7. I was against Obama's drone strikes and am against Trumps recent drone strikes that killed innocent people in Yemen. 
8. If this is true then it violates the US constitution. 
9. I think treating any human being with violence and disrespect is appalling. I think that people are being manipulated and polarized into two extremes on both sides. 
10. Acts of fraud and terrorism should be stopped and brought to justice. I also think that Trump and his supporters also have confirmation bias as nothing was said when 6 Muslims were shot in a mosque last week in Canada. People should be consistent in their policies and concerns and not cherry pick things that suit their political bias. 
11. I think borders are artificial constructs created by empires.
12. I think the media can often play into the same confirmation bias that suits their agenda. (Like most people).
I took the time to answer all your questions, perhaps you can do the same. In conclusion, I support neither Trump or Hillary as they are both a part of an elite oligarchy who work on behalf of corrupt companies like Goldman Sachs.

How do you feel about Trump appointing Goldman Sachs and ExxonMobil cronies, favouring Saudi Arabia because of his business ties (main country behind 9/11), working to give wall street more power by removing the Dodd-frank protection act, claiming he'll be the biggest military president ever and having new York spend $1M a day in security from tax paying dollars just so his kid can finish school?
@_date: 2017-02-07 06:42:24
I apologize for needing to ask this again but my previous question was ignored so I'll elaborate...
How do you feel about:
* Trump appointing Goldman Sachs cronies to his team, including the actual President Gary Cohn as the head of the Council of Economic Advisors. 
* Removing the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which will unleash Wall Street into doing similar investment schemes that led to the 2008 crash.
* Appointing the CEO of Exxon Mobile as his Secretary of State.
* Making repeated claims that the US should take other people's oil and signing a executive order to build the keystone pipeline (which will violate private property rights).
*  Making repeated claims that he'll be the biggest military president America has ever seen. 
* Being the first President to refuse putting his businesses in a blind trust (conflict of interest). 
* Keeping close ties with Saudi Arabia due to his ongoing business interests. The main country responsible for 9/11. 
* Having New York fork out $1M a day of tax paying money in security so his kid can finish school. 
* Having 17 women speak out that they were sexually assaulted by Trump, including one who was 13 years old at the time.
*  Him stating on multiple occasions over the years his close friendship with Hillary and Bill Clinton. 
Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer these questions. I'm genuinely interested to know how Trump supporters (especially a voluntaryist) feels about each of these issues.

2. Proof of reserves is always good.
3. Not sure because I haven't used it yet.

They've started having problems with banks and are now fully focused on bitcoin. Also Ponzi schemes need to grow exponentially to stay alive so now it's having its major growth spurt. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:26:50
We've had BTCChina and OKCoin come out already warning about this scheme. You need to buy bitcoins to pay into MMM so it puts buying pressure on the markets. 
You have doubts that a popular ponzi scheme can push the markets? It happened to litecoin last summer where its trading volume surpassed bitcoin for an entire month. The ponzi managed to accumulate 20% of all LTC! 
I wrote an article about it

Let's rewind and go back to your original point, Dimon's argument is wrong plain and simple. Why? Because Bitcoin is already a success, it grew as a grass roots movement out of nothing into a multi-billion dollar industry. 
Your argument that he manages trillions of dollars therefore bitcoin isn't important enough for him is also fallacious. That argument single handedly dismisses the entire purpose of venture capitalism. Ironically he seems to have plenty of "time to waste" talking and thinking about bitcoin. 
Judging Bitcoin on market cap alone lacks foresight and vision. Anyone who was smart enough to invest in bitcoin when its market cap was tiny would of made +10,000%, which is far better returns than giving your money to JPMorgan. 
Waste of time? Tell that to everyone here who's been accumulating sub $250 coins this year and doubled their investments on that last bull run. 
To say something is a waste of time because it lacks the governments papal blessing as a currency puts him on the wrong side of history. Most inventions that changed the world paradigm started off as something fringe and heretical. Old power structures hate change, especially if it comes from the ground up. 
I think Dimon and his company have already been "wasting time" on Bitcoin by the mere fact that they're trying to create their own blockchain. You can't build a blockchain without first studying Bitcoin. He may also be a little butt hurt at the fact that 175 of his blockchain patents have been rejected. 
His blatant hubris tells me that Bitcoin scares him because the idea of Bitcoin shows that it's possible to have an economy independent of fractional reserve banking. Of course this is a paradigm shift, it's an entirely different economic model from the ponzi scheme we've had over the past several centuries. 
You really think that a new decentralized peer-to-peer financial system doesn't threaten them? Just because our market cap is smaller (Bitcoin is only 6 years old) doesn't mean it's not growing to become real competition. Give it some time, Bitcoin will grow even more until it's out of their power to control. Technology in the information age has a habit of empowering individuals and restructuring old paradigms. Bitcoin is to banking what the internet is to cable television. 
Anyways, we can argue all day long about ideologies and semantics but time is the only thing that will determine who's right. Let's see what becomes of Bitcoin in 10 years.

You mean the one called the MMM Global Republic of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:20:09
Ok so here's some stats regarding the MMM Ponzi scheme 
It shows exponential growth, lots of organic traffic and most traffic coming out of China.
Now if we start to see a sharp decline correlating with a decline in bitcoin price/volume then that helps strengthen the case.

Good point, I also realized that I should have added a section on activating firewalls. I noticed that Macs have these turned off by default for some reason. A simple thing I do when I see a friend using their Mac is to see if it's turned on and you'd be surprised how long people go with it off.

Look at the bigger picture, Bitcoin being spawned out of the Cypherpunk movement, an attack on cryptography, freedom and privacy is an indirect attack on Bitcoin. 
There are countries right now trying to make online privacy and cryptography illegal. That could end up having a direct impact on Bitcoin. 
Considering the blockchain can be used as an encrypted messaging service, what impact do you think this could have on our ecosystem? 
Also using an encrypted email service is more secure for Bitcoin users in general.

Yes, they started advertising problems with traditional payments and started encouraging people to use bitcoin. 
The dump is an assumption based on what happened to litecoin last summer. I could always be wrong but markets tend to repeat themselves. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:44:28
Not afraid at all, most of my coins were acquired sub $250 so I welcome a new bull rally. Also I'm making nice profits scalping these dips. ;-)  
I just want to warn the community that a major dump is inevitable and to not lose their shirts FOMO buying.

Good point. I considered the $100 a financial hedge, which is much cheaper than what most people pay on insurance.

The inefficiency with the banking system is partially due to artificial restraints placed on the user. 
For example: spending limits, settlement delays and high fees. Also credit cards were never designed for the internet because they require divulging sensitive data. There are many examples of major data breaches. 
Your credit cards and bank accounts require permission to use and you are given a daily allowance on your own money. Your assets can be levied at any time. 
With bitcoin you can send a million dollars instantly to anyone for 10 cents. Show me any option in the legacy system that does this faster, cheaper and without friction. Although credit cards process 6,400 transactions a second, they are only settled in bulk with the company at the end of each day. 
If the current fiat system is so efficient then why are all the banks looking to upgrade with blockchains? 
Also the units in your bank account are not always accessible and they only represent checkbook credits of money owed to you. Not to mention you need to pay the banks for the privilege of lending them your own money. 
Anyone who does international business online knows how expensive and clunky the fiat system is. 
Also, it's impossible to send micro-transactions with fiat. 
Yes bitcoin does need to scale and lightning network has the potential to process a million transactions a second which will out match credit cards. 
Peer-to-peer technology cuts out the middleman and places more power and control in the hands of individuals. Decentralization is the "killer app."

It takes people hearing about something many times before finally deciding to give it a try. I know of many "fence sitters" who recently decided to buy some. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:44:40
It's laughable cause these people are missing the whole f point of the blockchain. Satoshi Nakamoto's abstract starts off by saying


payments to be sent directly from one party to another **without going through a
financial institution.**
Banks already have a digital ledger system, there's absolutely  nothing amazing about banks using private blockchains, who cares. 
It doesn't matter if Bitcoin turns into a world reserve currency or reaches mass adoption, it's still a paradigm shift and an alternative for those who want other options. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:15:32
It may have happened once but this one was really bad and lasted a while. Also I was locked out of hushmail for days so it may be a co-ordinated attack. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:37:20
I agree. We need to keep Bitcoin permissionless by not appealing to authority. I see this as another potential attack vector through social engineering. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 19:40:52
They market it as a way of "helping people out" etc. What ponzi schemes do is pay old investors dividends from money that comes in from new investors. The nature is to keep growing like a pyramid until it reaches market saturation and there are no new investors left.  Once this happens the money dries up and the whole thing collapses. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:50:37
Satoshi gave us an alternative financial system but some would have us revert to the same old paradigm...

What's your operating system? Most hacks happen on Windows. I recommend setting up a dedicated computer running Ubuntu as a Bitcoin only device. Or you can partition your hard drive to run it alongside your regular OS. Also you can set up Noscript on your web browser if running Firefox. Just having an antivirus on Windows isn't secure enough. 
Also Trezor is absolutely amazing and will take away all your worries and chances of getting hacked. 
Really sorry for your loss. :-( 
@_date: 2015-11-08 17:22:52
Yes except that currency already exists and it's bitcoin. Sure they can regulate the exchanges and third party companies but they can't actually stop a decentralized network. If they could, illegal Bit-torrent downloads would of been killed with Napster.

You bring up an interesting point. When I first heard about the loss, I thought it would be a high degree of motivation for him to find a tangible solution. Making mistakes is how we learn and I'm sure most of us in this ecosystem have taken a hit. Just another way of looking at it. ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-01 15:47:05
Thank you for this debate, you've inspired me to write on article on this topic. There are just as many disadvantages with banking, if not more.  Here's a list of examples that I will reference: 
I can pump out these types of examples all day long. 
p.s. mircro-transactions are good for tipping on social media (lower fees for tips less than $1) and payments between machines. People haven't developed a habit of tipping and demand usually only happens once a trend is established. I would argue that tipping is more relevant than hitting a "like" or "upvote" button, which now seems to have relevance for most people. 
Listen, you're arguments are on the wrong side of history. You would be hard pressed to argue that fractional reserve banking isn't a scam that resembles a ponzi scheme. 
As far as my Greek friends, I can't speak for them but can use myself as an example. I work online from home and have tried getting paid though many different payment options. Domestic banking can be fast and cheap but international payments are a bitch. Most of them are slow and the fees are insane. 
For the past year and a half I've been getting paid exclusively in bitcoin and the costs are practically non-existent. I actually make money because my coins are paid in USD prices and I arbitrage in the CAD markets. I made 220% gains from the money I made last year holding BTC, which is more than I can say for the shitty Canadian dollar that was devalued by 30-40%. 
Bitcoin is now an asset being classified as a hedge similar to gold. The cryptocurrency markets are more profitable to trade than stocks and futures. The markets aren't dominated by high frequency algos that front run the price and pack hunt retail traders. 
I'm not sure what your level of experience is with bitcoin or crypto but if you don't use them then your arguments are theoretical.

Hmmm... I don't know about this whole blockchain thing, I heard banks like HSBC use it to launder drug money. I think I'll stick to safer investments like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 16:42:47
I was able to withdraw BTC on Friday without any problems so am slightly sceptical of such claims. I've had some withdrawal/ deposit issues in the past but they were quickly resolved. 
Maybe I got lucky, is there anyone here that has direct experience withdrawing or being unable to withdraw coins recently?
It's nice to see the community is vigilant and I just want to make sure these claims are legit before going into full boycott mode. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:15:39
That sounds salty as hell. There are many pitfalls in crypto and those who survive long enough to get rich weren't just lucky, they likely put in thousands of hours of Hustle and study. Fortune favours the bold, which is why most of these vanilla investors will be working till retirement age. Most wealthy people take huge risks and throw everything into it, while the rest of the world clutches onto social norms that make them feel safe. All markets are risky but most provide very low returns.
