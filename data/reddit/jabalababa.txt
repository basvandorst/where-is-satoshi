I don't understand why it discredits anything? I just didn't know that was necessary to post transaction ID and if you read my response to the first comment, you will understand. And I am intentionally avoiding posting details about my transaction in hopes that my bitcoin doesn't somehow get stolen (even though its already gone...lol) if you private message me I would be happy to pay you to help me find this money.

So the transaction where i sent money from my wallet is no longer appearing in my transaction history in my wallet, but the transaction where I bought the BTC and it went into my wallet is showing up on wall of coins where i purchased the coins. Where do I find the trans ID for something that isn't in my history? I can show you proof that I am the owner of the wallet, and that I did in fact buy the BTC from wall of coins.

The transaction I am speaking of was for 1.7XXXXX btc on November 24, the .29818992 transaction has been spent, and it accounted for.

I am aware my terminology isn't perfect but I don't understand why everyone needed to downvote this..... How do i find the trans ID? I have the address that the bitcoin was sent to, but the transaction is no longer showing up in my wallet history. I have proof that it went into the wallet, and wall of coins can verify that, but as soon as i sent it from blockchain to the receiver, nothing happened with the money... The transaction was not sent with a transaction fee so is it possible that I miner didnt pick up the transaction and it was never really sent? I read some other articles on reddit and what not saying that if you send without a transaction fee when the market has lot of unconfirmed transactions it can get basically forgotten about and not transfer. The person that was supposed to get it got a pending transaction alert, but the transaction never went through... So i guess first step is find transaction ID... How is that possible without the transaction showing up in my history?? If you would possibly contact me privately I would be willing to pay you generously to help me solve this issue.

Ok. Here is the address that I gave to wall of coins when I ordered the BTC.

I know that the BTC made it to my wallet because I was able to send it to someone else, and the pending transaction showed up on their end as unconfirmed (however the amount was correct so obviously i sent it to the right address). This transaction has completely disappeared from my wallet history for some reason. 
Im using blockchain as my wallet. And yes I know I should be using a paper wallet but I don't generally keep bitcoin I buy in my wallet, I usually spend it as soon as I have it.

I posted the only address that I still have in a reply to Coinosphere. The address of my wallet changes and so does the address of the person I sent it to

The issue is that the 1.7something bitcoin has disappeared from my blockchain history, and has been removed from the block explorer... Wall of coins has
the transaction information where they sent me the 1.7 bitcoin(I saw it in my wallet), spent it(never arrived to sender but saw the unconfirmed transaction), and then the transaction disappeared from my wallet history completely, me ever having the BTC or sending it.

Where can I find this for a transaction that no longer shows up in my transaction history?
