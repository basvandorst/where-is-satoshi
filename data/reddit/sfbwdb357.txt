This is definitely the work of the banks and mutual fund managers. The little guy will get stung when the big money gets out and it’ll get blamed on “unregulated crypto currency”

It’s not supposed to be an investment, but a currency.  When it’s more widely accepted as payment for things (and used for payment), it will be less volatile (which I assume is what you mean by “safer”).  Problem is that (relatively) no one’s spending it on goods, just buying and holding in hopes of getting rich.  Eventually people will ask themselves “wait, what the fuck are we doing, this is nuts”, and sell off their bitcoin.  Just need to hope there are still a lot of buyers wanting to pay high prices for it when that happens.  If there aren’t, bitcoin is gonna hit a pretty bad speed bump.
Imagine if this happened with the dollar (or anything)  People just selling everything to get into dollars, because everyone else is doing it and the demand for dollars is high and they can make a lot of money.   Eventually people will want to take their profits and get out, but there needs to still be buyers willing to pay those high prices to take those dollars off their hands.  As long as there are buyers, everything’s fine.  When there aren’t many buyers willing to pay those prices (say, because something happened in the news that caused them to lose faith in dollars), lots of people will be running for the exits.  God help you if you don’t make it out in time.
