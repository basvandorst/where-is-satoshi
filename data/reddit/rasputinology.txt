Where in the US do you live? I've lived in and visited a huge number of US cities and I have never seen or heard of a fee free ATM. They are so ubiquitous that my immediate impression is that you are either lying or have never used an ATM.

Wow! I have never heard of anything like that. That's really interesting. I didn't know it was like that anywhere. Thanks for your reply! I apologize if I sounded confrontational. I've just never seen or heard of that, and I've been a lot of places in the US.

For a currency that's fighting for credibility, frontpaging something from Bitstrips on is incredibly sad. I literally cannot tell this sub from and half the time. Is this a currency tailor made for meme-loving morons, or a credible alternative to the central banking system? Fucking pick one. Jesus christ.

This image meme will surely appeal to all the 13 to 16 year old kids running marijuana dispensaries and are making important currency-related business decisions. 
Seriously though, how is half this subreddit smart people that can do math and think, while the other half is smug, childish image memes? At the thumbnail view, I sometimes can't tell the difference between and @_date: 2015-04-10 02:03:57
You sound like a really annoying, pedantic son that would rather score points being bitchy about where she works than helping her understand the benefits of Bitcoin.

Is there another bitcoin subreddit somewhere that's more serious and isn't full of childish image memes? Normally the discussion here is good, but tonight has been a total mess of childish nonsense.
