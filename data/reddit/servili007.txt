When you want to be a translator, it helps to use an account with a history.
Also, convenient timing on a new post warrants some suspicion, always.

We call the internet and its wealth of information 'free' technology. Nobody ever came knocking down my door about all those servers and hours spent on protocol and website design, nor the infrastructure needed to provide access to it.

Redditor for 4 minutes.
Seems Legit.

you do realize that paypal is more than happy to dip into any tied assets to refund fraudulent transactions, right? You're acting as a "seller" of BTC to this company, and paypal heavily sides with the buyer in the event of BS like this.
Edit - Also,  for the really stubborn who need a push back onto the "Don't do it" side of the fence.

People have been reporting this on this subreddit for the last few days, so I would have seriously expected someone to remove them from coinmap. Since nobody did, I went on openstreetmap, made an account, and edited the entry myself. I'm sorry you couldn't spend your BTC, it's things like this that indicate that we need a stronger community.
The OSM change will take a few minutes to take effect.

So their hosting provider apparently believed a spoofed e-mail requesting a server reboot and console access. If that's true, it's extremely poor oversight on the providers part, and would drive me up a wall. If anyone wants to publicize that host for the safety of others, please do so.

Wanted to point out a small error under the section "Be Your Own Bank". The word "eliminate's" should not have an apostrophe. Additionally, the "it's" under "Stay Anonymous" does not need an apostrophe either. The small details can make big impacts on how people perceive websites looking to do serious business. Just a friendly notice, good luck :)

This attitude towards protection loses some significance from a seller's perspective when you calculate and find that accepting a rare loss amounts to much less than what eBay and Paypal "charge" for that protection.
