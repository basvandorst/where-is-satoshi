Huh.  Something just clicked.  They were having trouble with transactions not going through because some of the used outputs were already spent. You had to wait a couple of days and then the system would automatically re-send your withdrawal.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:45:58
A phone number is not that safe.  It seems that Coinbase will tell you to get lost if someone gets into your account and uses SMS for 2FA.  The problem is that there's no way to completely disable SMS 2FA on Coinbase.  The best method is a TOTP authenticator (like where your phone shows a code that changes every minute).  
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:07:16
Whoa dude.  I've needed at least 7 BTC within hours more than once in the past month.  This is going to severely limit the utility of coinbase for me.

I believe Coinbase stores small transactions to group them and save on block size/mining fees.
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:11:56
It is, it really just depends on how your bank feels about doing it.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:25:54
Coinbase is FAR from safe.  They appear to have a huge 2FA hole right now.

It does, for anyone who has done basic research.
@_date: 2014-02-09 17:50:12
If by outdated you  mean "since last week".
It's actually their API that's recently become pretty robust recently.  2FA seems to be very weak.

Yep.  Well I'm one! Who is going to be two through ten?
@_date: 2014-02-01 00:21:03
They seem to be having some issues lately.  But that doesn't rule out a problem on your local computer.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:55:07
The point is that despite their complaining, it's their choice.  It's not their fault for not knowing about it in the first place.  But it does come back on them when someone tells them about it and they ignore it.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:20:37
Bitstamp locked my account pending "identity verification" with no notice and won't budge on verifying or even returning the original balance.  I'm done with them.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:30:00
Yep.  There is a rudimentary chain of custody, someone counting and checking amounts of money with a witness, tamper-evident bags inside locking bank bags, etc.  The employee will sign for it and take it out to the bank.  If they get robbed, they just and over money and (hopefully) the robber lets them go.  Insurance covers the loss.  Hopefully the employee doesn't decide that the bag's contents are worth more than the job.
Honestly it's probably more of a cost thing.  It's cheaper to have employees ferry bags than it is to have an armored car pick up.

I actually read the whole thing.  According to the poster, he wasn't using a gmail account, Coinbase made that up.  Checking the DNS settings of the obvious domain name supported that, as do the user's replies.  That and SMS two factor authentication was supposed to have been turned off on the account any way.

Much. Texts can be intercepted relatively easily.  Your phone could be bugged, your account could be compromised (either GV if you use it, your carrier-side account, or whatever your phone is synced with), or it could be intercepted (slamming/porting the number).
Getting the secret to generate TOTP codes requires compromising the target's session while TOTP is being set up or compromising the service's authentication system.

Not really.  You just have to know the address they sign with.  It might be specific to you, or to the receiver, or to the transaction.  You can refer to transactions by the txid if you need to use their services.
If the sender and recipient agree on the transaction going through, there is no need for the escrow to sign anything or even be aware of the transaction.

Cloning or slamming/porting, like I said.  Cloning is very difficult with modern phones though.  Porting is relatively easy, especially if you have access to their personal info.  You could also crack their carrier side account -  most carriers let you view texts to your number on a web site.

Except BitStamp is really untrustworthy and I refuse to have anything to do with them after they locked me out of my account with no notice.  Pretty much all exchanges require you to send them an identity theft package and beg for their favor to use ACH to buy BTC.

Then use it on a disconnected device. You might have to manually set the clock from time to time, but you can ensure that there's no way for it to call home once it has your secret.
Or use an open source client from someone other than google.  I don't trust google as far as I can throw them.  But there's a lot of idiocy around sites calling it "google authenticator one time password".  It's a standard and there are tons of programs that can use it.

A. You need to fix your grammar.  It's not always "your" and "there".
B. Google doesn't run 2FA.  It's standard HMAC OTP.  There are lots of clients.
C. 1 is wrong.  There are plenty of HMAC OTP clients for desktop and metro.
D. 2 is wrong.  With the level of hashing done on the HMAC secret, there is a much better chance of return on simply cracking your bitcoin address's private key.
E. 3 is wrong. An MITM attack is largely mitigated by verifying the SSL cert on the host.
F. 4 is wrong. You can and usually should consider keeping a copy of the OTP secret encrypted on a disconnected device, depending on how much of a hassle it is to have it reset by the service you use.
Physical tokens are a pain in the ass, expensive, and generally user-unfriendly.  And you're tied to a third party vendor who could have their seeds or secrets seized by legal or malicious action.

It's not limited to the API from what I've seen.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:23:36
I agree with your assessments (windows is better, and it takes more knowledge to run it securely, and Linux out of the box is more secure than what most people could do with windows).  But I think that using Linux and keeping it secure requires a comparable level of knowledge, so there's not that much of a difference between them in the end.
Far as hardening and total lockdown, even this windows guy is going to have to say that Linux will be the winner, though.

The coins aren't stored anywhere.  Like, they don't exist, physically or virtually.  There is no unique "coin" that gets transferred or spent or given, only address balances.  
Current balances are computed by reviewing the entire block chain (or the most recent parts of it, not sure how the checkpoint thing went) and determining current balances based on the transaction history of the block chain.  Your private key allows you to enter a transaction into the block chain that will be computed in further balance calculations.

There's no such thing as "a bitcoin".  Bitcoin is a protocol embodied by the block chain.  The block chain is basically just a list of transfers and balances.  It's like transferring money from checking to savings through your bank's web site - if you send a hundred dollars over, it's not like someone physically transferred a hundred dollar bill and they can tell you what serial number it had.  It's just a balance.
@_date: 2016-09-18 21:37:27
Florida isn't one of them. :(  They tried over the past few months, but it hasn't gone anywhere.
@_date: 2012-07-20 15:06:03
If your wallet is empty, yep.  Might want to keep it around, locked down and all, just in case it somehow gets transferred back.  If it does, and you deleted the keys, the money is gone.
@_date: 2012-07-21 00:01:43
@_date: 2012-12-01 00:34:00
That's not a bitcoin. That's a private key that can sign a transaction for one bitcoin.

Shouldn't be hard at all.
While you're at it, make sure you have the equivalent of wallet.dat encrypted by default with AES-256 or better, decrypted only to RAM, and only decrypted when a password is presented.
Shouldn't be hard to make it where it will start up and sync up and show your balance and transaction history without the password, and only require the password to initiate a transaction (eg, only when using the private key is required).

I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to registering.  But I've really come to hate the double registration most miners do.  Why do I need to register a username and password, then register a worker username and password?  My address is already a unique identifier.  What about access to stats?

I like this thinking.  I'd like to see the windows version (or some windows version) support the windows CSP interface so that can be done more transparently, too.  Yeah, the windows CSP supports the local store, but also supports smartcards and other secure hardware.
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:27:33
Why should they be separate apps?  One app could easily store several wallets, protected with reasonable encryption.  How about using a common (is it a standard?) 7z file with AES encryption as the store, keeping addresses from the wallets in memory so it can track balances on those wallets.  When (and only when) you need to initiate a transaction, the app can request the archive password, decrypt which wallet it needs, and keep it entirely in memory while it's being used.  Maybe hashed, or in parts and hashed.
It's basically the two concepts you noted above, in the same app, with heavy encryption protecting the private keys as a matter of course, plus one more: block interaction component, wallet management component, and privacy/encryption component.
@_date: 2011-08-23 01:45:38

Not too shabby.  What we really need is an app that can generate these from the seed string.  Sure I can carry the card around, but what if I lose my card and the site is down (given the off chance I remember my seed that's [a-z,0-9]{8})?  It's a great idea, but I'd want a little more reliability in the algorithm.
@_date: 2011-06-25 15:23:00
Sounds like they did a damn sight better on this than most would have.
@_date: 2011-07-13 13:17:51

Oh okay.
@_date: 2011-07-07 17:52:23
Threat?  Sounds like it's protection.  Hear me out.
Mining pools are not part of the specification, so it's not really a weakness in bitcoin.  Bigger pools, however are a bigger threat since if maliciously manipulated with a majority of hashing power, they could publish a compromised chain.  But larger pools with more hashing power are bigger targets.  Deepbit just barely got to 51% before they got nailed by a DDOS.  I think this will lead to more smaller pools, or maybe even more solo mining.
TL;DR: DDOS attacks help keep bitcoin hashing distributed
@_date: 2015-09-01 14:08:21
Good luck convincing them of that.

@_date: 2017-05-09 18:42:37
Not offhand.  Coinbase has (or had) major security issues that led to my account getting compromised and drained even after turning off the authentication method they used.  I almost lost well over USD$10,000 because of it, and they still claim I owe them money.  So I'm not going to be trusting them again ever.
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:16:59
In an FDIC-backed bank.  Or in a wallet that you hold the private keys to, if you're talking about cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2016-07-05 23:59:07
I've done it or seen it done with the ones I listed.  You can probably do it with others.
@_date: 2016-07-05 21:42:54


Yep.  Someone drained my Coinbase account with that.  I intentionally disabled SMS, or thought I did, but the attacker managed to sign up for online access to SMS through the provider.  Coinbase said that since the provider allowed online access to SMS, it was my responsibility.  No shit, why do you think I wanted to disable SMS.
They'll be able to claim the same thing against anyone who uses Sprint, Verizon, AT&amp;T, and probably other major carriers.
@_date: 2016-07-26 02:42:03
They make a point of calling it a response now.  Of course still stipulating that it must be in the form of a question.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:07:37
One way: Their "verification" is busted and won't ever let you turn off SMS confirmation, even if you don't have that number any more.  It's been used to break into several accounts.  People post about it here.
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:02:50
If you paid that much for it, then the market rate was accurate...
@_date: 2016-07-17 00:26:25
Shit with security too.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:41:22
Nope.  That's exactly what happened to me, and they said it was my fault that someone was able to use SMS authentication to reset my account password and immediately drain my account even though I turned it off.

Okay.  For what it's worth, I recall it not taking the money out of my bank account until the BTC balance could be issued.
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:03:16
Why wouldn't you be able to?
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:33:23
Good start.
Also, encrypt the wallet in the bitcoin-qt client.  Make it a fairly long password (at least eight characters of mixed case with punctuation, or at least four words with at least one misspelled).  Don't forget the password.  Without it, the balanace is lost forever.
Once you've encrypted it, make many copies of it.  Dropbox, skydrive, friends computers, email it to yourself, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:26:04

Pretty much anyone can sign up for it.  It doesn't matter if it supports international SMS, since Gox and almost any other service will send them from a US origin.

Not completely wild.  At least he's basing it on historical performance:

You can, but it's more complicated.  You can either transfer the entire balance out, or you can transfer to two addresses where one is what you intend to make and the other is the wallet's public address.

It's already in place.  The app is much improved in the most recent version, and integrates well with the wallet feature.  Right now it supports coinbase (through OATH pairing, not giving it your password) and blockchain (which is a little too primitive for OATH and proper 2FA so you're stuck using a simple password).
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:04:51
Fair enough.  Since the qt client supports nearly transparent encryption, there is little excuse for an unencrypted wallet.

I thought they had to be unsalted live hashes for that to work.  You can run a PTH from hashes copied offline?


YMMV for sure.  I love it, on laptop, desktop, and tablet.  The power management in win rt on arm is amazing.  I can go days without charging, assuming light device use and it being mostly in sleep.  Sure they say the bay trail tablets can do something similar and keep connected standby... I have one on order so I can see it first person, but I doubt it comes close.


Maybe you're just lucky.  I still see WEP used for domain and SMB traffic in enterprise clients.  We TELL them not to, but they seem to think that having a longer more complex password will make it impossible to crack...  We try to explain IVs to them, but...

The reason they got Ulbricht's keys is because he kept them unencrypted on at least one device (his phone, I think).  If the keys are encrypted to a strong password that you don't have recorded anywhere, it is practically impossible to seize the funds.
Even if they were able to recover the private keys, there could be many copies.  All one would have to do to thwart seizure is to send them to another address before the party attempting to seize the balance does.

Out of band means not through the same channel as the primary data.  Old style phones use in-band signaling (you can hear the dial tones - which resulted in some interesting hacks).  Out of band means control goes through a different channel, like SIP.  Or in this case, like bitcoin transactions.  The blockchain goes through the internet, but the transaction (at least in the first hop) goes through "sneakernet".
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:14:40
LBC wants you to send the bitcoins to them.  You do that, and the buyer gets a confirmation code and you get a release code.  Then you meet.  When the terms have been met (i.e. when they put the cash on the table), then one of two things happens (hopefully).  
1. You send the release code to LBC or click the release button, then the transaction is finalized, you get the confirmation code, and they get a text saying it was done.  You can then show them the confirmation code, they can verify it matches, and that provides a reasonable degree of certainty to them.
2. You give the buyer the release code so they can send it themselves.  Until they send it and get it verified, they have no confirmation that it is a real code.  But it may be good enough.

If they dumped them on gox, the value would go to about $5/btc.  You'd see a similar effect on any exchange or all exchanges, though to a lesser extent.  If they sold them at auction, a less significant but similar effect.  Basically, a dip or a crash.

Pass the hash only works well on LM and NTLM hashes - until recently it did not work at all against Kerberos tickets and even now it's not reliable or transferrable.  It's also usually a lot more difficult to get admin access to workstations than you seem to imply.  Apparently, this has been almost completely mitigated in Windows 8.1, though I haven't had time to read up on it.


That is definitely true.  If I'm pentesting, I always get much better results sweet-talking someone into letting me shoulder-surf their passwords than trying to capture hashes OTA (though you had a hair of a chance if they were using WEP).

What happens is that their system can't keep track of what it's spending.  At least one of the inputs used in the transaction with your withdrawal was already spent, so it was rejected by miners.  It takes about 48 hours for it to sort out and they will happily ignore you in the meantime.
Put your withdrawal address in here and it will tell you what's up.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:52:38

Seriously though, there is minor risk even if you meet in a public space, but I also have to stop what I'm doing to go meet you, then carry a stack of cash around until I get to a bank, then you could pass me counterfeit bills, or there might be some glitch.  
Point is, it's hassle and risk on my part and convenience on yours.  That costs money.

Right, but you do that movement out of band, right?

@_date: 2013-11-20 04:11:24
Here's my copypasta.  I guess you guys can steal it.
Localbitcoins routine
Here's the basic process for using localbitcoins as a transaction proxy.  
Briefly: LBC sends us different secret codes, we meet, you give me the cash, I give you my secret code and release funds and give you your secret code.  Once I have your secret code, you know that you have the balance.  With my code, you can prove that you're entitled to the balance if there are any technical errors.
In more depth: You put in a request at the advertised price.  We discuss terms if necessary (where and when to meet, etc).  I fund the transaction (i.e. instruct localbitcoins to reserve that balance for this transaction).  Localbitcoins will send you a verification code (do not share this with me, it's how I prove that I released the balance) and send me a release code (a secret code that anyone can use to release the transaction).  
An arbitrary period of time later: We meet as agreed - you don't need to bring anything but payment and the memorized verification code, though you're welcome to bring your own computer or phone if you want to verify.  You present your half of the trade (e.g. cash).  I give you the release code and release the transaction.  Once the release code is sent and the funds are released to your account, localbitcoins will send your verification code to me.  When I am able to tell you what your verification code is, you can be assured that you have the bitcoin balance and I do not.  Localbitcoins will also send you an email and/or text message (depending on what you have set up for your account) confirming the transaction.
Once a transaction is released, the funds are immediately available in your localbitcoins account and can't be reversed. You can send them directly to any bitcoin address (either a wallet you own, or a wallet someone else owns as payment, it doesn't matter which).  There is a delay of 10-30 minutes while the network confirms transactions (in very rare cases, it can be up to a few hours, but that is unlikely).  
For high amounts or when there is little trust between the parties (for example by mail), the LBC escrow service is available, but there is an extra cost to use that.
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:23:37
Also a good point.  Two different standards there.
Edit: for anyone wondering, OATH is a reference algorithm for HMAC-based one time password generation.  OAuth is for distributed authentication and delegation of authentication between systems lacking mutual or pre-existing trust.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:59:25
Yep.  If you want to trade, buy in with coinbase, take them to gox, trade, then take them back to coinbase and cash out.  Or even better just keep the bitcoin balance and buy stuff with them directly.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:41:48

Maybe you could look into optionally sending it be email or using browser-side storage.  I'm sure that's extra work that takes a back seat to getting the basics implemented.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:24:45
Spend tons of dollars to implement infrastructure to work with decentralized currency ... and lock all user accounts to an external single point of failure.  BRILLIANT.
This is why you use standard OTAP/TOTP/HMAC (time-based one time password) authentication.  Google, Microsoft, and tons of other entities have made authenticator clients for it.  Use them!
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:18:40
I've heard that some sites won't let you use the same 2FA code more than once.  For example, if you log in to LocalBitcoins with code "123456" then go to send 20 btc out to another account within a couple of seconds and authorize it with "123456", it will reject the code as invalid.
I need to test this in greater detail, but it's a good start. 
The site presenting its own 2FA code to you is also a good idea.  You add two of them.  One for the site to present to you (the site shows you "654321" and you make sure your authenticator shows the same) and one for you to present to the site (it gives you a blank box and you enter "111222").

I have heard that there are likely security issues with blockchain wallets specific to that host.  I do not know enough about them to comment with any authority.  
You should consider having multiple encrypted copies of a cold wallet for significant storage.

In Texas, when you give away things that have to be taxed any way (like beer and wine, unlike food) you pay tax on the presumed retail value of the item.  That can be calculated by some factors, but if you already sell them at other times then it's very easy - use that amount and pay tax on it.  Yes if you run a charity event and give away beer for on-premise consumption, you have to pay beer and wine tax for each drink you give away.  The point of that ramble is that sales tax is probably owed on that purchase (i.e. I agree with your assumption though I only know some of the specifics as they apply in Texas).
Depending on their POS system, they probably would have done three things - entered a free item of what the guy ordered (for inventory control), an open charge of the retail cost of the item (for tax and accounting), and a register adjustment of the cost of the item (to keep the till even).  That would keep inventory, taxes, and dollars on hand all come out even.  Some POS systems can even have a key programmed to do all that with one button.

In this respect, it's pretty much identical to bitcoin.  It's how a bunch of interconnected systems work now, but in the future they can agree to carry the same kind of data with the same kinds of payloads in a different way.  If they all (or most) agree to do it that way, they will interconnect.

They're called turrets.  It's a kind of VOIP phone/comm concentrator that links them to other traders in their group, coordinators in other groups, and outside contacts.  They can also be used to play broadcast or always-on conferences, and can put them at varying volumes and balances (e.g. you have your group on the left and an industry news channel on the right).
Almost all the buttons on it are hot keys, so the screens are for showing who and what that key goes to.  They're usually fairly static.

Why is the 2.5 minute block interval one quarter as secure?  With bitcoin, you have to wait up to ten minutes to see a transaction in a block, with litecoin you only have to wait two and a half to see it (average maximum waiting time subject to fast or slow blocks, etc).  What you're trying to mitigate is a fork, which is more likely to show up sooner in a faster block interval.  Is there something I'm overlooking?

@_date: 2013-12-03 12:57:51
Nope.  You could put the private key on there, but that would not be very good.
A better way to do it is to use a smart card.  Most card terminals support inserting a smart card.  The trick is that usually smart cards have their own private key that they won't release.  They'll sign messages (so you could use it to generate a bitcoin address) though.  But then you still have to trust that the transaction the merchant says they're presenting to the smart card is what they're actually presenting to the smart card, or your card could be signing away your entire balance.  And if you lose the card, you lose all the funds in its address.
This kind of thing really needs a centralized payment processor.

It's not that.  It's that the market may change in the time it takes to get the funds liquid and in your hands, and you lose that 5% advantage you had selling on gox.  If bitstamp is at for 950 usd/btc and gox is at 1000 usd/btc, you would want to liquidate your 10 btc on gox, haul the cash to bitstamp, and buy there so you can make 5%.  But in the three weeks it takes to get the 10,000 USD to bitstamp, their price rises to 1050.  Instead of making $500, you lose $500.

For sure.
We really need to get on the ball with some kind of nearly transparent encryption standard.  Ideally something that can use a physical or virtual smart card.
I would love to see a Bitcoin client be able to use a physical smart card for storing private keys.  You could load the card with non-exportable private keys in an offline wallet, then safely take it around with out.  Obviously not perfect, but a hell of a lot more flexible than just storing a file.  I'm not sure if smart cards can support the kind of math you'd need to do for that though.

Of course that's blind brute-forcing.  Since you use dictionary words, slightly changed, the solution space is many orders of magnitude smaller.  
* None of the words begin with a number nor end with punctuation (except one).  
* Few of the words begin with caps, but many have caps in the middle.  Those are out of the solution space from that overview.
* It is especially resistant to the caps varying ("Rather than trying aaaaa0000, ZZZZZ9999, and every possible combination in between, it tries a lower- or upper-case letter only for the first character, and tries only lower-case characters for the next four characters.") as it has caps in the second, third, and fourth in varying positions in all words.
If these patterns become more popular (either/both using a phrase at the beginning of a book and/or capitalizing one letter consistently through the passphrase), complexity could be increased with a couple of extra measures.
A single misspelling in one word would increase the search space by many orders of magnitude.  Using a phrase with longer words would also have a similar effect.

I would not use Bitcoin if I did not trust the merchant and needed some means of recourse.  In some cases, that's worth paying the 3-6% credit card premium for.  In some cases, it's not.

There's only so much complexity necessary to create the maximum amount of entropy for the algorithm.  I haven't looked at the bounds of the inputs on the function on the site, but it's likely that using a sentence out of a book with a single misspelling or deviation in capitalization would be practically impossible to crack.
For example: "IT was The besT of Times, iT was The worsT of Times." would almost certainly never be guessed.  Obviously, pick your own book and deviation that you can remember.
Note that this makes the assumption that capitalization is not filtered by the passphrase function and that it is not truncated at any significant length.

Well the idea is that the smart card won't give up the private key (at least not easily) but will easily sign transactions.  It also will not readily sign transactions unless you give it a PIN or other kind of authenticator.
The obvious problem is that since you generally won't own or trust the hardware controlling the card, it can assure you that it's asking the card to sign a transaction for x amount when it's actually asking it to sign a transaction for x*n amount.  The goal was to have a way for transactions to be made without anyone being online and which gave the payee a copy of the transaction to transmit to the blockchain at will or convenience.  There are obvious potential double spend issues which could be encountered through no malice of the payer - if you used the card more than once offline, then only the first transaction would be valid.
As decentralized as the network is, Bitcoin basically requires that the party drafting the transaction be online, up to date, and have a centralized store of transactions for each private key.  It was actually a pretty good exercise that made me understand some details of transactions much better.
And I just had a flash of a reasonable way to do it using a third party counter-signing.  It might mitigate the trust host issue to a large extent.  Mostly depends on the capabilities of smart cards though - how smart they are.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:09:42
Not really.  If there is a back door on some wallet host that allows you to get through without using 2FA if it's activated, we need to know ASAP.

You seem to be trying to imply two things, neither of which is true:
1. Open source code is inherently secure.
2. The code hasn't been altered between the time it was published and the time the media is disconnected from the computer.
Fact is, you're only likely to catch 1 if you read and understand the code. You're only likely to catch 2 if you read and understand the code after moving it to the offline computer, or (assuming 1 did not happen) you perform a manual out of band hash verification of the package.

A straw purchase is a violation of federal law, and illegal in every state.  
But a lot of people don't understand what a straw purchase is; a straw purchase is buying a firearm on behalf of someone who could not legally buy it themselves.  It is not a straw purchase to buy a firearm for someone, complete the 4473 yourself, then give it to them as a gift, so long as they could have had a 4473 approved if they filled it out themselves (though it may be a violation of state law, depending on the state).  It is also not illegal to pay for a firearm on behalf of someone then have them come to the FFL, complete the 4473, and pick up the firearm (which is how it's done in states where the gift procedure above is illegal).  
The latter is how I would do it if I were doing it - get bitcoins, convert them to cash, give cash to gun dealer on behalf of buyer, buyer comes in and picks up their item.

Point is, I get the idea that you're around 18-20 and just starting to function in unfamiliar parts of society as an adult (banks, courts, etc).  You're going to hit some rough spots and need to internalize a few things.  One is that while they almost certainly have your best interest in mind, your parents are not all knowing and make honest mistakes.  As you come into adulthood, you'll need to go from complete and immediate trust in everything your parents say to getting a feel for how much they know about what things and when to listen to them and when to respectfully go your own way.  Say you have a pastor who you are certain is a very good person and always tells you what he believes is most correct and best for you - would you listen to his financial advice?  I wouldn't.  Religious and social, sure, but not financial.  Point is, as you act as an adult, you need to take your own actions and base your confidence in your own knowledge and growing experience.

If you're using blockchain, you're screwed.  They're pretty insecure.
If you're using coinbase, you're actually pretty safe.  OAuth (well OAuth2, since coinbase uses the second version like everyone else) is kind of complicated.  The app sends you to the site with a request for a level of access to your account.  The site makes you enter your username, password, and 2FA token.  Then it sends two very long passwords back to the app.  The first one (access token) can be used many times, for any action authorized when you signed in, but it expires in two hours.  The second one (refresh token) can be used only once, all it does is request a new set of passwords, and has no expiration date.  They're tied to an entry for the app under your account in coinbase, and can be revoked from the coinbase site at any time.  The tokens are sent directly to your device with an SSL-encrypted connection and are locked in the app's sandbox that no other app can access so it is very unlikely that they can be captured.  They are also very long, on the order of a private key, so it is very unlikely that they could be guessed.
I'm a stickler for 2FA and other proper security measures, and I feel safe using that app.

You're paying for convenience.  Someone drops what they're doing to meet you somewhere and take risk by carrying cash around.
Long as you learn how the system works, it's pretty hard to get scammed.  They function as a proxy.  You meet up, put the cash on the table, the seller checks it out and releases the transaction.  Then they give you a secret code that the site originally gave you to prove that they finalized the transfer.

Their implementation is really neat.  And from their descriptions, it's very secure on the back end.  One down side is that it requires both parties have a coinkite account and sufficient available balance for quick verification - but that's no different from Visa or MasterCard.
I don't know if it will directly lend stability, but it certainly has the potential to spread adoption.

I see your point, though you were kind of a dick in trying to lead to it up there.
You can reconstruct the wallet from the private key and the blockchain.  You'll lose a record of unused generated addresses, but they will be recognized if/when they are used.  So that is the primary advantage of the wallet.  You actually can get just about all of your wallet by typing in the private key on the command line.
But a wallet is in many ways more portable.  It's almost of negligible size (really would only make a difference if you're talking about storing it in human memory).  The client will recognize it immediately.  You can load it in a client without worrying about that client having direct access to your private key.  Encrypting it doesn't take much effort.  Of course this is bitcoin-qt-centric but many clients will recognize that wallet format.
The main detriment of keeping your private key in memory ready to spit out is that once you produce it, it's there in the clear.

I don't think running to reddit is that bad of an idea if you're doing it in a section that they've basically started as a support/QandA section.  As long as you don't mind it being public and relying on reddit being up.
But yes, if you have a routine problem, your first response should probably be to try to contact them directly through private channels.  That's what support@ is for.  You can start crowing on public channels if they ignore you or tell you to fuck off after your money goes missing.

It will take several business days.  If you need BTC now, hit up LocalBitcoins.
Once it's verified, you can add a credit card (takes another couple of days to verify) and buy a smaller amount instantly.
Whatever you do, stop.  Learn more, do more research, and take some more time.  You need to know more about bitcoin before you jump in - if you buy and sell based on emotion then you're going to have a bad time.  So take the time to learn how it works, make sure you learn about two factor authentication and use it, and remember that there are a lot of know-it-all amateurs out there who don't know that much so suspect and verify everything you hear (including this).

It was really just a simple example that most people would recognize.  Capitalizing one letter consistently will significantly increase solution space.  Capitalizing letters inconsistently (not counting obvious schemes like the first or last letter) will dramatically increase solution space.

Yeah but you didn't mention the private key.  You also can't solve for it in a common sense of it.  You have to guess it and try to match it to those guesses. It's called brute-forcing.

Those won't work well on anything past windows XP.  LM hashes were easy to crack because of the way they were stored (and they can be disabled, though they aren't by default).  NTLM hashes are much more difficult to brute force, especially if you use anything at all complex.

You said you can "break a pc password".  I think most people would understand that to mean get the password, not set it to blank.
And really all that does is get you access to a local account.  You won't have access to any credentials stored properly (that is, in the DPAPI store), certificates or keys, or any domain.

Okay you have a point, but that usually involves replacing the SAM.  That will cause difficulty with the computer logging on to the network, though you can usually con a user into getting around it.  It will also destroy credentials stored in the DPAPI for all local users.


It's actually pretty neat.  It looks like they changed the way RDP credentials are sent for admin logins, stopped storing lots of things in memory, and the like.  Just from a brief overview.


True, but I think encountering WEP is far more likely than all those factors converging.

You're correct on the first part.  Unless it was recently released before it could be examined in detail.  Especially if it were compromised immediately before upload.  Yes, it's very unlikely, but it's possible.
For 2, no, it would be very easy to compromise rendering, copy, paste, save, or the file after it's been saved if the host were compromised.  You really need to do a manual hash check with what the author posts as the hash.

Have you actually interacted with anyone in the process of introduction to bitcoin?  Do you make many trades on LocalBitcoins or spread tips?  Have you given ANY thought to your points?
1. So who is it for?  The tech guy already into bitcoin who already has the blockchain downloaded?
2. What is it regarding then?  Do you think bootstrap.dat will be useful for blockchain.info?
3. If that's true, why did you just say that it wasn't about the main client?
4. Yes, we know that, but do you think the difference between fifty and sixty nearly random characters is going to make that much of a difference to an end user?
You sound like a smart aleck completely disconnected from reality and without any understanding of evangelism.  Your attitude is destructive and, as a collective, probably the biggest obstacle to mainstream adoption.  I understand that you're probably upset with criticism of your idea, but you're just going to have to get over it.  The average end user won't be trying to walk you through the flaws so you can improve on it in the future, they'll just ignore it and move on.
