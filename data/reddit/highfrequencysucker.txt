It works well on macs. 
It needs more people selling stuff. They need to focus more time and energy on strategies to get merchants using it. 
Focus on getting one OS working well first (say macs), then target market people who sell on ebay and use macs to move over and replicate their auctions on OB.
Built a tool that will read the person's auctions on ebay and start the listing for them on OB.
They need to start strategies to move people over.

Can someone strap a feed back over her mouth?  Give her a salt lick or some hay?  The braying is really getting on my nerves.

Everyone who "verified" themselves with an exchange is already screwed, DoctorDbx.  
Those exchanges are legally required to use the US SSN or TIN to file tax paperwork directly to the IRS.  They already know.
All those people need to get together, specify group damages, and file a suit.
Bitcoin is a currency.

Why not?
Also, why do they need 80 bytes?  MrMadden is right.  You can XOR two 256 bit hashes and get them down to 32 bytes instead of 64.  As long as you know one of the hashes, and the XOR, you can derive the other hash.
Why isn't that good enough?  Sounds like greed to me.

If I take the 16 byte VIN number from my car, add the license plate number to the end of it, and put the model year at the end of that, and my mom sends bitcoin to the public address for that string, and I use the funds controlled by that private key to buy a Lamborghini, is that one set or two sets of car keys?

Haha that's so funny.  Really.  Funny like a clown.

Well, that certainly is new.

Oh shut up kid.  It's past your bed time.  Get off of reddit.

They are brilliant ideas.  Simple and effective.  I have no idea why it's not already expected that exchanges sign for their bitcoin balances.
I guess we'll find out who Superintendent Lawsky works for soon enough.

PLEASE STOP GIVING THIS FAKE ISSUE LEGITIMACY.
We need an increase in the block size to 8 M B with a scaling increase after this.
What we should be doing is making a list of opponents who are being paid by blockstream, greenaddress, and other 2.0 protocols.  They are dishonest, lying, sacks of @  We need to remember.

I hope they go after that fascist son of a bitch with a civil suit and ruin him financially.  Scumbag.

Wow, NY Times.  Thanks for classifying our best hope for escaping our primitive financial situaiton as a new payment option for kidnappers.
Newspaper of record my posterior.  Between boobs like Krugman who jumped the shark over a decade ago, shitty articles like this, and their direct role in starting the Iraq war (search "Judith Miller" "NY Times" "WMD"), why do we even bother reading them?

Nope, it's TCP/IP for money; the base protocol for digital currency. Sorry, altcoins.

I agree, because when someone is licensed, exit scams can't happen.
[Just ask the Chairman of the National Association of Securities Dealers.](
Edit: and no, I don't think Circle has liquidity issues, but your logic that bitlicense = safe is amusing.

How does this dangerous change that no one wants go in without debate? 
Meanwhile it's black friday, there are 9000 backlogged transactions, and we can't get a simple, heavily tested config change through to let Bitcoin scale?
What a dick.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:49:08
What? It's the reference client, this was not a popular change, is very risky, it's black friday, and we have a 9k transaction backlog because we can't get BIP101.
WHERE IS BIP101?
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:06:56
You put this risky crap into core on Black Friday without any debate, while we are 9000 trx backlogged because you and your bought and paid for cronies won't support BIP101? 
Unbelievable. We need to fork away from these lunatics asap.
