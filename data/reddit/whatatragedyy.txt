The mempool hasn't fully cleared since the 27th of october


Segwit will be fully adopted soon. Give it another Eightteen Months™. nothing to worry about.

The ordinary user can't notice the difference between a MP3 file and a WAV file. On the other hand, the difference between small and big blocks is glaringly obvious. 
Segwit, LN... You expect him to jump through all these technical hoops for what? A 15 dollar discount on a 30 dollar transaction fee?

There are currently 3299 transactions with a fee of more than 640 satoshi. (1.28mb +500 satoshi) For the median transaction, that comes out to ~25$. So yes, A guaranteed 1 block confirmation transaction comes out to 30~35 dollars. 
Having to check the memory pool and doing 3 minutes of calculations before making a transaction. A small price to pay to secure the financial revolution.

Patience guys. Adoption is only 90% down from last year.  A healthy correction. It'll come back any time now

Btrash shill. bcash is a shit coin

Use litecoin for spending. BTC is a store of value.

The memory pool hasn't cleared since the 27th of october and doesn't look like it will clear any time soon.


If you're paying a 30$ fee ~~for anything other than speculation,~~ at all, you're using cryptocurrencies wrong


Because ideological small blockers didn't exist 7 years ago. The ideological worship of a 1mb limit was too absurd for words, so naturally it didn't get addressed.

"Amazing things"
Overthrowing the banking system by making the act of spending money an annoying and confusing chore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:00:17
Both increasing the blocksize (within reasonable bounds) and more efficiently use of said blocksize is desirable.
Turning a multi billion dollar network into an ICO (Bitcoin isn't the product, the LN is) 6 years after the initial release is fucking pathetic.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:40:39


Sales taxes apply to bitcoin.....


How much you earning an hour? 6$? 7$? In case you're not a shill, but simply retarded: Satoshi was criticizing traditional payment systems.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:06:13
    oh so that totally explains how BCH was already being traded as 
    soon as it went up, you know, because there are no confirmations 
    needed or anything and everyone knew exactly at 00:00.00 on 
    the dot to start spamming the API, right?

1mb: miners receive a handful of big fees
big blocks: miners receive a boatload of pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:37:40


Sounds like a great advantage. Since LN is around the corner why don't we go ahead and support the efforts in their struggle to scale to 300kb. 


The community did. You declined 


World wide adoption is a tiny eetsy bit ambitious for a coin that's been commercially unusable for the last year.

Thank you. I appreciate it

That Bitcoin is a store of value

There are 44K transactions under 20 satoshi per byte. $0.71.
There are 40.5K transactions over 190 satoshi per byte. $6.70
His original premise of this being an 'attack' is religious dogma.

Use Big Boob Coin instead and get a 29.99$ discount.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:35
In the white paper the size of transaction size is mentioned once, on the first page no less:
    The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
    minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility 
    for small casual transactions,


But even by your own standards the current iteration still fails 2 out of 3

Averages. how do they work
Either way. Good job bud. You got me there. I'm sure the chinese will be glad to learn that they only have to work 6 hours to make a transaction as opposed to 10
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:38:40
I didn't mention any alt-coins bud. You're seeming a bit on the defensive.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:45


Edited afterwards. No source.
Here bud. I'll do the math for you.
in 2012:
4,755 dollar / year with the assumption of 2080 work hours per year. = 2.28 dollar per hour
Taking into account inflation, rising wages, over-hours... Being generous you'd be very hard pressed to reach 4 dollars per hour, let stand 5.
You don't have a fucking answer to my rhetoric which is why you're focusing on worthless numerical details
Whether it'd be 1, 3, 5 or 7, nunnadis matters. the original point still stands.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:44
Trying to use a store of value as a currency is pretty stupid tbh
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:19:30
People like you are destroying BTC. With 2mb blocks I won't be able to run a full node on my TI calculator.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:05:21


Stop spreading this dangerous rhetoric. The blocksize is already too large as is. Trust the Developers. [They know far better than us how to make bitcoin succeed](
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:21:47


Definitely a threat! Financial independence for the people! Meanwhile the average hourly wage is 3 dollars in China. The fee for a fast BTC transaction is 30 dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:30


There are 1367 alternatives which provide that service at a 29 dollar discount. There are 3 alternatives which provide that service with a decent liquidity on exchanges. What sort of benefit does paying an extra 29 dollar provide me?


Ah yes, because bitcoin was designed specifically for the people with vast amounts of wealth.
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:49:11


Times change quick huh 


That sounds terrible. How are you going to support the miners with such abysmal fees. Do you want the Bitcoin project to fail?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:14:29


You don't. You don't respond with anything other than 2007 era memes, stale rhetoric and snark.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:03:19


This is a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:26:36






With the unconfirmed tx memory pool being over 270mb, and having to pay over 30 dollars for a fast transaction I'd assume the criteria of 'needing it' has unequivocally been reached.

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:25:40


Btc just had a period of 2 days when there were anywhere from 2.5 to 1.5 blocks per hour. During that same period there was immense volatility on exchanges.


Quite obvious. For the next 18+ months bitcoin will have no use case other than being a speculative asset.


You clearly don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:41:57
It's alright to be angry that you got scammed. However, there are bad individuals of every race and creed. Bringing up this case again and again only gives fuel to anti-Semitic stereotypes. In Trump's America this is the very last thing we want to do as a society.
