Thanks for the tip, but to be honest, now that I've commited and downloaded that damned blockchain I feel rather invested in the full wallet now.

Thanks for the help.  You may have just saved me from a nightmare.

That's a real shame, because Bitpay has the option to split your sales between hard currency and bitcoin, and I would like to keep hold of some.  With Bitcoinpay it's one or the other.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:59:15
Thanks for the feedback.  To be honest, I'm chalking this one up to a learning experience.  I don't think interest in Bitcoin crosses over much with interest in gardening.

I'm fortunate to be in a minority in my age group when it comes to online ability (I'm no pro, but you should see some of my friends).  I make most of my money offline, but I take pride in what I offer and it's all of the highest quality so it made sense.  The upfront costs are tiny as it turns out.

I was being really careful, someone told me Reddit are quite strict about advertising your businesses.  I don't know enough about the rules around here to take the chance, but i'll send you the link.
I haven't added anything explicitly stating that I accept bitcoin yet, but the option is there in the cart.
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:32:44
Always seems like there's more for me to learn.  Thanks again.
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:52:55
Will do.  To be fair, immediately after it was done syncing I copied the entire install directory to an external drive out of paranoia.
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:57:22
I need something that plugs into my stock levels and invoice system.  Can I do that with the button?
Apparently the plugin uses a newer version of PHP than my website runs on.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:41:20
With fees as low as I'm seeing here, I'd be able to offer some great deals.  My average spend per customer is around £6, and paypal are taking £0.30 + 3% of that.  So on average I'm losing roughly 8-10% per transaction in fees.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:22:02
It seems like the learning curve to get into trading is much higher than for accepting as a merchant.  I'd love to get into it a bit more once I wrap my head around the basics.  Thanks for the advice.

Wow, just downloaded mycelium to my phone and it's SO much easier to work with than the desktop wallet.  That thing took hours to get going.  LITERAL hours.
As a new user that would be my biggest piece of feedback.  If you google 'bitcoin' and use the official page that pops up at the top the site you land on a page that's pretty user friendly.  I downloaded the 'bitcoin core' because it claims to be the most secure.  I'm excited to get my wallet set up and try out my address, but the wait to install the software is excruciating.
While the mobile wallet may not be as secure (I admit, i'm doing the typical user thing and not really reading everything) but the setup is so smooth and quick.  I have an address, it functions and I can use it anywhere.
I've sent myself some coins from the kind tips I received here and am about to do a test run of the new store plugin.  Very excited.
One more thing, lets see if I can make this work...
120 bits
Just to see how it works.
Hmm, didn't seem to work.  Sorry, no money for you.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:28:27
Ill definitely be posting regular updates, I'll let you know how easy it was to get set up, and if i get any sales.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:05:18
Hold up a second, what's all this I see about 0% transaction fees? That seems... beneficial.  At the moment paypal are taking £0.30 plus 3%, which on small orders is a LOT.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:23:08
This is what I've discovered over the last few hours.  Though to be honest, fraudulent purchases are not really a worry for me.  I'm not selling electronics or gadgets or anything, there is little incentive to rip off my store. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:54:43
Thankyou very much.
Apparently the website software I'm using supports bitcoin plugins, so it's just a case of getting it all set up and working.  It's just a lot to take on board and not something I'm really willing to trust someone else with.
I'll have a look through as much of the information as I can, I'm guessing this isn't a 'dive in and see what happens' type of deal?
I only ask because my natural inclination is to find the best merchant with a plugin for my store and just go for it.  Could you envisage any problems with that approach?
For me, as long as I can get the currency into my bank, with the same or less fees than paypal, I'm not too bothered about the details (this may however be how I've ended up getting scammed before).
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:24:29
Another vote for Bitpay.  Thanks very much for the input.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:21:34
interesting and informative.  Seems I have a lot to learn.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:30:46
There seem to be a lot of sites doing VERY similar things with Bitcoin, but apparently the Bitpay plugin doesn't work on my site due to the version of some software im using.  Bitcoinpay would work "out of the box" which would make my life easier, but it seems not many people have heard of them.
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:06:30
Ah, I learn another important thing about Bitcoin.  Do I NEED my own wallet? Is it not safe to just leave the bitcoin in the account with the provider (ie Bitpay or coinbase)?
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:35:58
Thank you very much.  I've noticed that every link I follow to read up on Bitcoin leads me to many many more links.  I've started getting my head around it, and it's very interesting.  As you say, the only really hard part is stopping before I get overwhelmed with information, and processing what I've already read.

I wouldn't bet on it, he's young and in love.  I remember what I'd have done for money to impress my lady at his age...
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:32:00
My original idea was to cash out right away and get the cash into my account.  It seems that a better approach might be a % split.  Keep a few % from each transaction and hold onto them for now, as the value of Bitcoin seems a little bit... unstable.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:20:56
I know he uses reddit, and I would imagine he uses this place, but I'm not 100% why?
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:25:18
Yeah, I'll have to look into it.  For now it's something I would like listed as an option for payment, simply because it's another service that my customers can use and I like to offer the best service that I can.  The much much lower fees (from what I understand so far, usually the only fees I'll be paying are to get Bitcoins converted into £ and deposited in my account) are quite attractive though, so I'll be looking at ways to push Bitcoin sales.
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:51:55
The 'seed'? I was assuming it would be a simple matter of taking a copy of the entire install folder for the wallet.  Would that not work?
Ps. I have to ask - is there a quicker way to make the wallet sync? It's taken an age already and still seems to have a LONG way to go.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:12:28
Hmm, I don't exactly fall into those demographics but is it worth having as an option just in case? I make fairly adequate sales through Paypal and face to face, but I like to offer as good a service as I can.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:27:34
Thanks very much for the tip.  Took me 10 full minutes to work out the website behind it that collects the tips.  I feel old today.. heh.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:13:02
Thanks again for all of the help.  I'm going to have a good read over as much as I can find tonight and see what happens.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:10:06
My grandson said that BitcoinPay have a compatible plugin with my store and are a good company.  Have you heard of them and are they safe to use? If he's already done some work on it i'd hate to let it go to waste.
@_date: 2015-03-29 23:21:13
That was my initial thought.  Better to have and not need than to need and not have.  Thanks for the advice.
