Because people have been sleeping inthe fire. I just want to share bitcoin with people who also like rage against the machine.

I wouldn't worry about it at all. Now that money is ours we will all buy things that give us peace of mind. Even the super rich will buy things to give them peace of mind. Eventually everyone will have it and there might be peace on earth. Nothing to worry about.

I wrote this maybe it will seem more real as to the power of the blockchain

What if it's more like the Tower of Babel? 
Everyone was able to speak the same language so God changed their language and dispersed them across the world.

Lol right? In the Mormon Church its more like...We want ten percent and we will take care of you.
The Distraction and Deception thing is from this talk.
Not Mormon BTW just FYI.
Mormon Church accepts bitcoins for donation too.

I think there are lot of people with bitcoin that are asking for trouble. Like when America first started Britain tried to tax America and America asked for trouble. America had to use guerrilla warfare to fight them off.

Use gdax.com gdax is owned by coinbase and is an exchange where you buy bitcoin at market value. At gdax and you can use your coinbase account to sign in. If you click deposit you can deposit the bitcoin from your coinbase account to your gdax account.
I only like buying from coinbase if I want to buy it with my debit card.  If you want to buy larger sums of money like between 1000 to 10,000 dollars worth at a time just transfer money from your bank to gdax. It took me like 10-14 days for my money to go through but you won't get fee'd this way.

The dollar is a pyramid scheme. Everybody knows the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.
Until Bitcoin came along lol

"Distraction and Deception is of the devil" is how the Mormon church describes it.

There are so many things that I could agree on this subreddit that I am just to start saying nothing but...
"I concur"
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:05:44
lol I didn't even know it happened last year but yes! On a larger scale yes! Watch closely.

I gave everyone a ledger and started it with me having 50 monies. People really liked the idea. We will see what happens. If the value of our money grows it will probably be because we never really realized the goods and services that could be exchanged with each other.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:11
Yea because politicians are greedy and dont trust each other lol. Their goals are to make money not to listen to the people. XD
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:46:32
Definitely but until then we are fighting an uphill battle. 
Privacy is the difference between someone knowing you have something of value taking it or not knowing you have something and leaving you alone.

The only thing i could think of is people making business plans that revolve around the one true currency of the people, bitcoin.
Or hackers that group together and steal peoples bitcoin. They might end up being the people that are the most powerful at the end of this frenzy...

As someone who has no idea...
I'm expecting the price to skyrocket New Years and then crash.

Because people have been sleeping inthe fire. I just want to share bitcoin with people who also like rage against the machine. Im trying to spread the word using symbols instead of cold hard facts that people dont necessarily understand. Weird but I think thats how we have been marketed to for years to buy stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:56:21
Yea I only had so much energy to accomplish my goals myself and it wasnt making me very happy and thought it might make people happier if we all accomplished everyones goals while also educating people about the importance of the blockchain technology.
Honestly though it could start out purely educational with a group of people just to explain the importance.

People with bitcoin will break quantum computers before quantum computers can break bitcoin.

The only way to be certain the person doesnt have the private key is to buy a disposable hardware wallet. AFAIK there is only one and it is called openDime

I'm new to bitcoin and I've day traded and made money. But then again I don't do it very often and really didn't make that much money. It was actually quite stressful knowing when to buy back in again and wouldn't recommend.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:07:11
Lol good point.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:14:24
I'm just saying, if you post information saying that you have wealth the IRS might be interested in it. Same thing happened when rich people started posting pictures of their wealth on instagram but said they were unable to pay taxes on it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:19:11
Yea that would be kind of cool. I just tried out my idea of making a currency among the people I work with today and it was definitely interesting. It definitely got people thinking of what kind of value do these imaginary monies have? 
Anyways I ended up giving a little bit of money to the people that gave me little piece of mind and more money to the people who I feel give me more piece of mind. It seems that even though I live in a capitalistic country which is good, on the level of having to work with people who all make minimum wage it feels communistic. I work hard to keep everything running smoothly and it seems everyone else likes to check their phones or stand around and talk about nothing and it just drives me crazy. Anyways I ended up giving most of my money away. Now the people that I trust can buy my hard work and the people that don't can't buy my hard work. They can just have my mediocre work.

How does a computer prove that it mined a block first when after it finishes mining it gives the answer to all the other computers?
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:48:09
Not too sure what all that means but today it seemed like "The lord of the flies."
I'm not sure if we will keep it or just get rid of the idea. I think it's going to be a group decision thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:45:09
What do people think that now that we have bitcoins, will people make more transactions on average with bitcoins or less transactions on average than lets say the average amount of transactions that people make with dollars?
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:16:47
People that have all the money in the world like to buy one thing. That is peace of mind. The more peace of mind they can afford, the better they can understand the risks and see which ones are most likely profitable and thus make more money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:02:52
There are three classes. 
The rich, the middle and the poor. The one percent who are rich are have essentially enslaved humanity by making people stupid; making them do stupid jobs everyday and have to interact with stupid people all day long for stupid dollars that always lose value so you have to do more stupid work to make more stupid money to survive. 
Then the white paper came along. It's real value wasn't quite understood enough but it's blatantly clear now. Everyone is the bank and no one is the bank. Everyone is to blame for the price of bitcoin and yet no one is at the same time. And while people still have their stupid dollars and keep putting it in bitcoin the value of bitcoin keeps going up. But what about the poor?
Does the middle class care about the poor right now?
Yes. The middle class does care about the poor. The money the rich have is astronomically larger than that of the middle and lower class. The poor and the middle class are trusting each other to work together to overthrow the rich. The middle class are going to invest in the poor because they simply believe in them.

Just remember now the government knows you own one of these and everything else about you. Please protect your privacy when showing off wallets. Use VPNs and throw away accounts. We are are only at the beginning stage of this ordeal.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:44:16
I know its dumb, but privacy is important. People don't realize how much information the government has about its citizens.

I know, who thought you could put a value on trust and trade it between the people you trust? Mind blown...

So it's like the second coming, but instead of believing in Jesus, you're believing in cryptocurrencies? I don't know about everyone else but I believe in cryptocurrencies.

Ahh thank you. And so if someone awards themselves more money than they are supposed to give themselves the blockchain rejects that node?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:02:41

Coinbase sells bitcoin. Exchanges will let you exchange bitcoin at market value for a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:27:09
I though if you bought a large amount of bitcoin it would increase the price.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:09:04
I'm buying opendimes right now. They are disposable and can be traded like cash to keep bitcoin off the network. I would highly recommend checking them out at opendime.com
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:56:02
Oh sorry, I meant to delete this post and repost it but it was basically the story of exodus when the Egyptians were afraid that the Israelites were becoming too numerous to be safe, so they forced them all to work and they killed their babies. Just this time it's the government that has enslaved us with money and now that people are becoming financially free...we are financially free from the government.
The miracle we perform is the price of bitcoin and yet they don't believe us.
Soon we will be saying..."let our people go"
