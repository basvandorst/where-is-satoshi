Well if you’re worried about me pulling out just because the value goes down you have nothing to worry about. I’ve only invested $100 (in several crypto currencies) and if I lose it all it’s not the end of the world. I learn by doing, so my hope is that I’ll slowly catch on and maybe even invest a little more as time goes by.

Haha! I wish I could my friend! There is so much to learn and I really want to ‘get’ this. I’ve sort of looked before leaping and invested a very small amount. I’m hoping for the best but even if I lose, it’s not that much.

Great info. Thank you!

Thank you. There’s so much to learn. I appreciate the explanation!

Thank you so much! At first I thought the +number was the price per share. Then when it got in the negatives I was really confused!

What is the app called?

Are you saying that when you first started looking into it you instantly knew everything? There was no learning curve?

I have one and it’s balance is always going down too!

I feel your pain. So far I’ve made a whopping dollar. Most of the time it just shows that I’m down 50 to 100%. I’m starting to wonder what all the fuss is about. Luckily I only invested like $100 to begin with or I would be very upset.

That is great news!! I just checked and I’ve officially made 17 cents!!

I’ll take some gold thank you.

Ok so I see my numbers going down more and more lately. Say I don’t cash out (have no plans to) and it goes to where my account says $0. When it goes back up again does my account go up as well? Or did I just lose all that money permanently?

Thank you. Good to know!
