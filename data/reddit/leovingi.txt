Except for the amount of money that can be transferred, because if the price of 1BTC is, for example, $1, it would be impossible for you to transfer $1M.
That's a pretty huge difference...

While I agree with you about BTC, the tone of your rant suggests a feeling of smug superiority where the plebs around you need to be educated and when they refuse, you immediately assume they're "too stupid" or "too arrogant." 
Seriously, mind your own fucking business and if someone doesn't want anything to do with BTC, then leave them be. It's not your place to be pushing something your friend clearly doesn't want, no matter what his reasons are.

I am one of the people that buys in at any time when I have free funds available to spare and I can easily explain why you shouldn't be confused by my actions.
It's a way to decrease my risk. I don't day trade, I don't care about speculation, unless it just so happens that I luck out and buy right before a huge rise. My long-term vision is that Bitcoin will be the future, so even if the price is $400, $600 or $800, I don't care. The value of my holdings might decrease in the short term, but in the long term I would still come out as a winner.
Obviously, my gains will be smaller than someone who day trades and tries to buy low and sell high, but at the same time so is my risk - I'm not a financial guru and I won't pretend I know when we've reached the lows and the highs.
Also, what if you're waiting for a crash that never comes? A correction will probably happen, but I'm assuming you have a number in mind where you'll say "Right, this is the low and I'm buying in." We might never reach that number and the price might shoot right back up to where it was in days. That's the risk, my friend.

You might be absolutely right, but I would err on the side of caution. Especially since history has shown otherwise.


The criminalization of drugs is a perfect example. The US government (using them as an example, because they still have the power to affect the future of Bitcoin, much more so than any other country) doesn't care about the greater good and it definitely doesn't give two shits about creating a black market.
And even if the US is alone in forcing merchants to only accept money from clean addresses, it still carries the risk of slowing down Bitcoin adoption for international trade. If an address from China is not in a whitelist, merchants in the States wouldn't be able to accept it.
Obviously, this is all pure speculation and I must admit that I have a VERY HIGH level of distrust in the US government, so here's hoping that you are actually right and I'm so very very wrong!
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:29:58
And so it was foretold, that in the end of times, it would not be government regulations, a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol or the loss of trust in the network that would destroy Bitcoin, no - it would be something a lot more dangerous.

@_date: 2013-11-27 16:39:20
Another point to add is that the higher the price, the more money is moving in and out of the network.
What this means, is that it's becoming easier to move larger and larger quantities of USD, GBP, etc. around. For example, if the price of 1BC is $1000 and you need to transfer $1'000'000, you need to buy 1000BC on an exchange, which isn't that easy to do, especially if a lot of people need to move millions around. But if the price of 1BC is $1'000'000 you only need to buy 1.

I'm not saying that what I propose is 100% fact, it is just my opinion. If you look at history, we have lived under a deflationary currency for quite some time, and it hasn't been as terrible as most people point it out to be. I'd say it has been way better than the boom and bust cycles we have at the moment.
But then again, we have never had anything like Bitcoin. Every other currency that has been deemed valid by the state, has always involved some sort of central planning, thus skewing the results of it's performance. Bitcoin is 100% free market and I look at it as an experiment.
The truth is, we have no idea where it's going to end up. Will it become so powerful it could stand toe-to-toe with the US Dollar? Will it just take it's place as a transactional mechanism replacing VISA, but still living together with all of the state currencies? Or will it fail and die?
It's definitely good to ask these questions though and I wouldn't give you weird looks IRL :)

I partially agree, but purchasing BC is definitely going to improve in the future. And a lot of people are actually spending BC right now, so it's not an absolutely insurmountable challenge.
Also, once you understand the process, there's nothing stopping you from making a large BC purchase that would then cover your BC purchases in shops, online stores, etc. for quite some time.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:16:47
Ahh, OK, I hadn't thought about it from that perspective. Guess it sort of becomes a catch 22 then, but I'm still hopeful that the price will stabilize at some point.

* Remove registering, use only the ad revenue to finance the site. Remove the barrier to read an article and maybe enjoy an increase in ad revenue.
* Stick to registering, miss out on the ad revenue, because a bunch of people read the article in the comment section below or don't read it at all. You said it yourself, you read the article here, so the site gets 0 revenue from you. How is that beneficial?
Requiring registration to read articles online is an artificial barrier and I for one don't care who it's done by and what kind of articles they write - it's moronic!

@_date: 2013-11-23 22:36:50
For the last time, this isn't that hard!
Look at the technology, think about the innovations and the increasing amount of investments pouring into the ecosystem and come up with a number. Do you think 1BC will be worth $10'000 in the future? If you truly believe so, then if the current price is less than that - buy! Timing the market is risky and no one here can tell you if it's going to go up or down in the short term. Anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.

@_date: 2013-11-25 16:25:58
Any proof of that? How can the exchanges even do that, unless they hold huge amounts of BC themselves (not the BC that belong to their clients)?
Also, I would expect the "dark market exchange" price to be at a premium, so if I was a part of that scheme, I would definitely be buying up BC on a public exchange for cheap and selling it on the "dark market", thus equalizing the price after a while and negating any benefits of such an exchange even existing.
Or am I missing something here? I have thought about such a thing, but I just can't see it working.

@_date: 2013-12-03 17:23:36


But he's not actually saying that. Show me where he states that in the article? All he's saying is that gold is valuable because people accept it and Bitcoin has no value, because it's value is only based on people accepting it. And as far as the alternatives go, can you name at least 1 currency or asset today that I can transfer to someone on the other side of the world for pennies or nothing at all, securely, quickly and electronically.


Present me with some numbers displaying the volatility of gold during the first 5 years when people started using it as a medium of exchange and then we'll talk. Otherwise, it seems unfair to compare a completely new and experimental currency to something that has had thousands of years of history. Wouldn't you agree?
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:36:59


If it's so easy, I wonder why nobody has done it already. And by replicating it I mean doing it 100% - reaching the price of BTC and it's market penetration, level of investments and network strength. Not so easy now, is it?


I'm assuming she means "free" as in "disregarding the massive electricity costs." On top of that, the supply is still fixed no matter what hashing power you throw at the network, so free money it is not.

If I want to quickly transfer my money overseas, the bigger the price of 1BC, the better! It's easier to buy 1BC at $1000, than 1000BC at $1.
And if the money gets exchanged back to fiat, once it reaches the destination, the current price means almost nothing.

~~No, it doesn't (if you use Bitpay).~~
I may have misunderstood you. I'm now assuming that you meant that the savings for the **customer** would be wiped out by the volatility. But that's not really an issue, if you have a bunch of BC in your wallet and you spend them as you go. It's only an issue if you top up your wallet every time you want to spend BC, which doesn't really make a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:20:57

So why would people sell their stash, if the price falls down to a level that is unacceptable to them? They will stop and wait for it to bounce back.
Personally, I don't see us stabilizing until there is liquidity in the market that can provide for money transfers in the millions! Until then, we're going to continue up and down as different people decide to sell, the ones who are more confident or just haven't reached their target buy back the coins and the cycle continues.
Please remember, it's a completely bootstrapped currency, with no central government to direct it's path - we can't achieve the necessary liquidity without speculators, without savers, without people moving money in and out of the network!
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:45:54
Theoretically, this can happen. Practically? No, because by doing so, every miner and everyone who holds Bitcoins, would be decreasing the value of their holdings. It makes no sense to do that.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:27:45
I wasn't implying that, but now that you mention it - yes, that does seem to be what I'm saying. If we do not fight the market, there will be times of inflation and there will be times of deflation, but without central control fucking things up, it will always come to an equilibrium.

@_date: 2013-11-19 20:32:36
I am. I don't hold a lot of BC, so I won't be spending any in the near term and will be waiting for the price to hit $100'000.
Some people might say this is bad, because if no one spends BC, they become useless, but what we have to remember is that different people have different prices in mind. If mine is 100k, for someone else who might be holding hundreds or thousands of BC, that price might be 10k. Eventually, we will reach a tipping point where people feel comfortable spending a chunk of their savings without diminishing them. And I would bet that at that point, there might not even be a need to exchange it into fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:37:44

I disagree on the staying power, I'm convinced that it is definitely here to stay and my kids will be using Bitcoins from day 1, but that's just like, my opinion, man...
On the other hand, I do agree that safeguarding Bitcoins is a hassle at the moment. I actually transferred the bulk of my savings to a paper wallet a few hours ago and every step of the way I had to think twice whether or not I'm leaving some sort of security gap, because I'm paranoid like that. At first, I wanted to use an offline wallet, backed up in a bunch of places, but that was too much for me - and I'm a developer.

No, they won't. The merchants don't depend on Bitcoin, it's just another way for them to accept payments. And if NOBODY spends Bitcoins, we would find out about it really quickly and the value of BC would start to go down, thus encouraging spending. Eventually, it will always reach an equilibrium.

And those are perfectly normal answers to questions like that.
Mining is a space race, it's almost impossible to compete unless you have deep pockets and/or cheap electricity.
And yes, if you're looking to buy (I would assume that if you want to buy, then you've done your homework), then buying right now is the safest choice, especially if you're willing to go long-term and if you don't have the necessary skills for daytrading. That's because nobody can predict the future, so knowing if it's going to fall or rise at any given moment is almost impossible. But that response is nothing like the "BUY BUY BUY It's goin' to a million!!" that you used as an example.

But in any case - even if you're right, who cares? It doesn't matter how the currency was and/or is used, it's impartial to anyone's morality. The only people who want to make a strong connection in people's minds between drugs, gambling and Bitcoin are the regulators.

You do realise he's talking about lending money with interest, right? Not about the purchasing power of your savings increasing naturally over time, as an economy prospers.
Also, this:

But would you have any idea on how it would work? Even if it's just speculation or a thought exercise?
Does the exchange try and bring together a big buyer and a big seller? If that's the case, then yeah, I can imagine at least the benefit of a stable price - it's good for both parties.

It's not like everybody will suddenly decide to sell all at once. It's going to happen in stages, everybody has a price in mind where they will cash out a chunk of their BC savings, maybe invest and differentiate their portfolio. That is exactly what's happening right now, because for every BC buyer there must be a seller.
You can't just sell BC if there is nobody willing to buy at your price.

When did I say that? You seem to have a tendency of putting words into other people's mouths...

Yes, it does. If I want to send $1'000'000 to my buddy overseas and 1BC is trading at $600, I'd like to see the banks find people willing to sell them 1666BC and then find people willing to buy them back. Now imagine hundreds of banks doing this.

People are talking like accepting only clean addresses would be up to the merchant and everybody would have a choice. Forgetting that almost every single extremely bad law we have in place right now started out as only a minor setback, nothing to worry about and we have always been assured that it won't go any further!
Once the system is in place, even if we do have a choice, it won't take long for that choice to be taken away from us and validated addresses will become mandatory! And it will be much harder to fight it then, so we must do everything in our power to nip this in the bud!
Have we forgotten about the Patriot Act?

What math? The only numbers in your post are 25%, 50% and 100%.
And I don't get the incentive bit... incentive for whom? The incentives for merchants to accept Bitcoin are pretty clear.

So you've essentially created a lottery where people give you money, you take a 5% cut and everybody else would have to trust you not to run away with said money? This shit's not going to fly!
Or in words you'd understand better:
Nekas tev tur nesanāks, vecais! ;)

It seems you have a pretty good idea on how to solve the homelessness problem. So go ahead and do it, everyone would thank you!
Oh, what's that? You don't have a clue and you're just complaining on Reddit about the actions of people actually doing the work!?
Yeah, that's what I thought.

* You're pretending that the ideas on your blog come from other people, not yourself
* You put different addresses/pseudonyms at the bottom of the posts, without explaining that they all belong to you, giving the illusion that people are actually submitting ideas to your website, where as the truth is that nobody cares.
That is the unethical bit, not you hiding behind a pseudonym!
Now I tried to be nice, because I always give people the benefit of a doubt, but I think it's pretty clear that you're fishing for bitcoins so you can just fuck off.

Compare the actions of someone who genuinely believes in BC and wants it to succeed and someone who is a conman pumping and dumping - they are indistinguishable. Both people will go around telling people to invest in BC, potentially driving up the price and making themselves more well-off in the process.
Now, is that a bad thing? If you believe in BC yourself, then it doesn't matter. If you don't, then you wouldn't buy them anyway, so it still doesn't matter.
The only way someone might be able to answer your question would be to get a confession from Max!

Again with this circular reasoning...
Let's get one thing straight - when people say that deflation will encourage people to hoard Bitcoins and not spend them, this is what they are saying:
"Bitcoins will carry on, eventually becoming so expensive, that people will not spend them, rendering them useless as a currency and driving down their price!"
See what happened there?

Depends on what I want to buy with my BC. If I'm surviving purely on BC (no fiat) then I need to eat. There is no way I'm going to make a decision to starve myself for a few days, just to let my investment grow. On the other hand, if I want to buy a new TV using BC, then I can afford to wait a while for the price of BC to rise relative to the USD, so I can get the TV for cheaper. But here comes the interesting part - if I can wait a week or a month for that to happen, then most likely I don't need a new TV!
My personal view is that this stops unnecessary consumption of goods, which is a positive in my book! Instead of being forced (sort of) to spend my money due to inflation, I am in complete control of what I buy and when I buy.
