I've read Peter Thiel's book "Zero to One", and he specifically states that in the venture capital business he's had have one or two winners and the rest are failed startups. It's the nature of the business.

I'm pretty sure he knows Bitcoin Core is a reference client. He is referring to Bitcoin Core as BTC to help differentiate from Bitcoin Cash.

Interesting point. I wonder if "correlation does not necessarily imply causation" in this case.

So there isn't any buy wall because it's negative? Am I reading this right?

Read the white paper.

BTC is the original chain, but in terms of the underlying principal and technical BCH is carrying on Satoshi original intent. He States in white paper when block size limits are reached to just increase block size.

Did you move all your coin bittrex? If so they should be in bittrex if it was successful.

Seriously, why is ripple in the picture? It stands against everything cryptocurrency was even invented for.

Capitalism for us plebians, but socialism and bailouts for the wealthy.

Good for you man. Good FOR you! What's the point of money if it doesn't enrich your life somehow.

Could be a number to different reasons. Price is obviously heavily manipulated, as you can see.

I maybe wrong in this statement and just want clarification, but isn't money created through interest?
I agree there is a zero net change in your statement, but how do you account for interest? 
Interest can be perceived as rent for borrowing but if the bank loans $10,000 but receives $10,000 + interest, then $10,000 &lt; $10,000 + interest.

Somebody is trying to keep the price below $1250.
