Gartman and Kevin O Leary should catch up over lunch!

I don't understand what makes him think Bitcoin is unlimited in supply?

Have you completed the assignment for the first week?
I enjoyed the videos, but unable to work through the assignment. Any help is appreciated.

Do you really think every person who follows this sub has already put in their money into bitcoin? I'm a newbie and trying to understand how it works, man! 
I'm just playing devil's advocate to understand why would JP Morgan not be discreet about the whole process if they can after their CEO called bitcoin a fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:30:51
But if Bitcoin is supposed to be anonymous, why would JP Morgan keep it visible on a public ledger?
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:26:57
Yeah, I get that. I was of the understanding that your public key can't be traced back to you/the company. And if you can hide it, why wouldn't JP Morgan want to hide it?
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:20:43
Is this legit?
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:25:36
Thanks for calling that out!
Didn't understand why they'd want to be open about it if they had a chance to hide investing.

That's exactly what I'm going to do. But I didn't really expect them to treat a customer like this. After all, it is Citibank. Other banks in India are even worse!

**Savings account** is an **account** where individuals keep their **savings**. **Salary account** is a type of **savings account** where you **salary** gets credited and it is opened by banks for employed individuals only.

Something I'm trying to digest as well. Been a customer since 5 years, with clean credit.
Waiting for 30 days to pass to file a case with Banking Ombudsman. Our system is fucking slow!

Haha thanks for sharing!
 I've already updated my HDFC account at my firm for next month's salary. And ICICI gave me a welcome kit for a privledge savings account with benefits. Demand Draft from ShittyBank received within 24 hrs. Thank God for free market system!

In view of the associated risks, it has been decided that, with immediate effect, entities regulated by the Reserve Bank shall not deal in Virtual Currencies or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling VCs.

They've snail mailed a check (demand draft) for the balance I had in the account

Mandatory requirement for crypto exchanges in India -_-
@_date: 2018-07-26 15:10:45
The legal system is too slow, Supreme Court will come with a regulation in September. Banks have gone in panic mode right now because the last circular instructed them to wind down the operations with crypto exchanges within 3 months. I'm guessing more crypto-investors in India will be hit in the next few days!
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:47:27
So does your mom
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:05:56
Isn't bitcoin about banking the unbanked?
190M Indians are unbanked. I might be privledged enough to leave, what about the others?
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:42:48
It was ShittyBank. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:25:51
It seems extreme until you've gotten burnt. Seems plausible after you've gotten burnt. Thanks for the advice, though!

Citibank India
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:17:28
I haven't traded anything in the last 4-5 months. They (Citibank) analyzed my account statements with crypto-exchanges during Nov-Dec'17.
