From a high of $2000 USD an ounce to $1200 today is a 40% drop over the last 6 years. Like I said, nice try, kiddo, but you don't know what your talking about. Gold is not a stable store of value, the USD is.

yeah... Just a 50% drop in gold's value over the last five or so years. Stable.
Nice try, kiddo.
@_date: 2018-09-23 18:13:52
You really don't know what your talking about. Gold can experience "hyperinflation" through the demand side, its a terrible store of value, its only good for speculation and industrial use. I don't expect much from a *bitcoiner.*

If you mean the dollar, it's widely accepted everywhere, doesn't fluctuate much, and I can use it to buy debt and collect interest from the government or buy other dollar denominated investments, so my money/savings are always growing. I can safely store it in a bank where it's FDIC insured. With the Visa network I can instantly pay with zero fees and review my transactions afterwards to reverse any unwanted purchases.

Bitcoin isn't a currency, it never was. Nothing is or ever has been priced in bitcoin. If the merchant has to change the "bitcoin price" every time the amount of dollars it can buy changes, then the currency is dollars not bitcoin. When the last time you checked the exchange rate between the dollar and Euro before you could make a purchase in the states. Bitcoin is just a heavily manipulated speculative middleman you have to buy into before you can pay for something in dollars. I'd rather just pay directly in dollars using Visa, it's completely free, instant, and I'm protected from fraudulent charges. Bitcoin fails at all three. Sorry, I can't support a shitcoin.

What makes fraud illegal. What makes it illegal for a CEO to start dumping company stock when he finds out bad news, what about a CFO embellishing the numbers in the next financial report, what about someone buying up a cheap penny stock and then marketing it to other people to pump the price while dumping behind the scenes, or a completely nonexistent company going public and selling stock in an ipo. 
There are people who believe in an unchecked, unregulated free market, but they accept that these things are fine. They put the blame on the person that got scammed instead of the scammer.

Your here because you are a gullible, easily manipulated idiot. Bitcoin is an over-hyped turd. Successfully marketed to lower intellectual individuals who believe they are investing in some hot new technology. Anyone who has any experience with coding or data networks, and doesn't have a bridge to sell, can see that blockchain is utter trash.
Bitcoin is not a currency, it never was. There is absolutely nothing that is priced in bitcoin and never was. If the merchant changes the price every time the amount of dollars a bitcoin can buy changes, then the currency is still dollars not bitcoin. When's the last time you had to check the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen before making a purchase in the states. Bitcoin is just a middleman.
The bitcoin is a "store of value" is the argument spoon fed to naive, gullible idiots. Just because something is "limited edition" doesn't make it valuable, guess what, in that case my beanie babies are also a store of value. A true store of value needs to be tethered to some real world use case demand outside of just pure speculation. For example, real estate is a store of value because it has a real world use case (house, farmland, retail space, etc) that drives demand on top of speculative demand. Stocks and bonds are a store of value because they have a use-case (company ownership, derivative payouts, fixed annual interest payouts, etc) on top of speculative demand. Commodities like metal, food and oil are stores of value because they have real world use-cases ( industrial and commercial uses) on top of speculative demand. These markets have a reason to exist outside of just purely speculation, the better the reason the better the store of value. And no, flushing thousands of dollars worth of oil and electricity into the toilet doesn't give bitcoin any value, just as if I were to burn a $100 note, the ashes wouldn't have any additional value because I burnt a $100 note.
To be fair the bitcoin network does have a weak use case. Bitcoins can be used as a payment system like Visa or PayPal. Now unless your running a child sex ring, bitcoin is a horrible horrible payment system. It's slow, costs the user money to use, no fraud protection/reversible fraudulent transactions, merchant accessibility is super low and actually declining, forces the user to pay taxes on every bitcoin transaction, requires the user to buy into a highly speculative/manipulated middleman bitcoin in order to ultimately buy something priced in dollars, all while being an ecological disaster, being less efficient then a coal engine.
Anyone with some critical thinking skills can see that bitcoin is just a speculative circus marketed to naive, gullible people. Of course you can make money off of speculative circuses, because there's no limit on stupid easily manipulated people.

Price moves from 10 years ago don't have any bearing today. Your discounting a 70% drop in price, probably will be 90% eventually, all because bitcoin "started" at zero. The very definition of a naive idiot, the crypto hype marketing crowd got you hard. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:44:45


By artificial growth, I mean that for bitcoin to support these prices, the supply needs to be kept constricted. The people holding large amounts know that they can't turn their paper gains into realized gains without crashing the market, there is very little liquidity supporting the price, they can only sell into a pump. The *potential* sellers now far outweigh any interested buyers in this market, it's a waiting game for more buyers that just don't exist. 
If a bunch of people need to hold off from selling to support a assets price, than that assets price isn't the free market price. It's been manipulated, just like the diamond market. 
I meant to say 18,000 bitcoin sold since the December high.

By most markets I assume you mean the established markets; futures, forex, equity, and bond markets. The big difference is on the amount of liquidity. A liquid market is much less volatile as there is a lot of orders on either side of the price padding the price. In a market like forex, which has a daily trade volume of 25 trillion dollars, you can sell 1 billion dollars and it would be a drop in the bucket. If you were to sell during extra liquid hours, London/New York sessions, a billion dollar order would barely even register on the price. In comparison, the trustee only sold about 18 million dollars worth of bitcoin, 0.2% of the alleged market cap, and bitcoin lost 70% of its value. The crypto market depends on people not selling their coins to produce artificial growth, if anyone ever tries to cash out the market doesn't have the liquidity to support the selling and drops. There is very little holding bitcoin from $1000, all it takes is for some sellers decide it's time to cash out. This is not how a real asset grows.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:19:24

Gold is used for multiple industrial and commercial uses. From dentistry to electronics to jewellery. There's a steady stream of real world use case demand backing the price of gold.

I think you're confused. I don't have any metal, never hinted I did in any of my posts. Unless your a commercial producer, there is no need to buy/sell metals, other than financial speculation, which is best done through derivatives contracts instead of physical metal. 
I wouldn't ever invest in anything that doesn't produce something outside of its purely speculative supply/demand price - a business produces revenue, real estate produces passive income, bonds pay a fixed yield. 
I consider bitcoin a highly speculative payment system. Of its two use-cases (speculation and payment system), it excels at one and is terrible at the other. In sure there are a few people out there that *legally* try to use bitcoin to pay, but its overwhelming use-case is pure speculation, a virtual casino where people can bet against each other. This is made very evident from the front page of every crypto sub, personally I have nothing against virtual casinos, just another tool for speculation.

Personally, I believe bitcoin is a turd. The idea of a fixed supply or *asset* currency is an economic failure, as a payment system Bitcoin/crypto are far inferior and much more wasteful than what's already available, namely Visa. As a store of value it's too volatile because of a lack of liquidity, which defeats the purpose of a store of value, which is supposed to be stable and preferably steadily growing. A business produces revenue, real estate can produce passive income, bonds pay a fixed yield, bitcoin produces nothing of value; it is purely an instrument of price speculation. Commodities like metals and oils have industrial use-cases, even if these assets are only a function of supply and demand, and other commodity markets like the grains/meats/coffee/orange juice have obvious use cases. Of course, all of these markets have pure speculators, but there is a practical reason for their existence outside of just speculation.
Bitcoin's only real *legal* use-case is volatile speculation, essentially a casino where market participants can bet against each other on its price and get a thrill. Bitcoin is a turd.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:38:25
So it doesn't solve the problem of capital flight due to bad economic policies, you'd have to be a moron to believe it did. Even if bitcoin was the currency of Venezuela or Zimbabwe it would still have hyperinflated, because hyperinflation is caused by capital flight, and not from excessive printing of currency. Printing massive amounts of currency is a symptom of hyperinflation, a last ditch effort by the government to hold on. That's why even gold backed currencies would experience rapid inflation cycles, bitcoin is not some golden solution, it's more of a turd than anything else, a turd aggressively marketed to naive, gullible idiots.

Bitcoin is not a currency, it never was. There is absolutely nothing that is priced in bitcoin and never was. If the merchant changes the price every time the amount of dollars a bitcoin can buy changes, then the currency is still dollars not bitcoin. When's the last time you had to check the exchange rate between the dollar and the yen before making a purchase in the states.
The bitcoin is a "store of value" is the argument spoon fed to naive, gullible idiots. Guess what, in that case my beanie babies are also a store of value. A true store of value needs to be tethered to some *real world* use case demand outside of just pure speculation. For example, real estate is a store of value because it has a real world use case (house, farmland, retail space, etc) that drives demand on top of speculative demand. Stocks and bonds are a store of value because they have a use-case (company ownership, derivative payouts, fixed annual interest payouts, etc) on top of speculative demand. Commodities like metal, food and oil are stores of value because they have real world use-cases ( industrial and commercial uses) on top of speculative demand. These markets have a reason to exist outside of just purely speculation, the better the reason the better the store of value.
To be fair the bitcoin network does have a weak use case. Bitcoins can be used as a payment system like Visa or PayPal. Now unless your involved in the criminal world, bitcoin is a horrible horrible payment system. It's slow, costs money to use, no fraud protection/reversible fraudulent transactions, requires the user to buy into a highly speculative/manipulated middleman bitcoin in order to ultimately buy something priced in dollars, all while being and ecological disaster, being less efficient then a coal engine.
Anyone with some critical thinking skills can see that bitcoin is just a speculative circus marketed to naive, gullible people.

Bitcoins finished down 3 out of the last 4 years (counting 2018). Also I have to keep reminding you, you can make money speculating on turds. There's a lot of dumb people that will pay for turds. I myself was able to buy some bitcoin at $1000 to "play with" and dumped the shitcoins on some gullible suckers on the way up. Doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is a giant turd.

Sure bitcoin is accepted, but not accepted as a currency. If the merchant is adjusting the "bitcoin price" everyday according to how many dollars bitcoin can buy, than bitcoin isn't the currency, it's just a payment system. Bitcoin is competing with the likes of Visa or PayPal, and not competing with the dollar, like this sub likes to believe.
Why would someone accept a metal as payment? Precious metals' dollar value comes from their industrial uses plus speculative demand. It's not a currency, nor is it a payment system, it's a speculative investment. It would be like walking into a store and trying to buy stuff with a barrel of crude oil, or a few bushels of wheat.
Crypto has certain features; having no weight, being relatively easy to transfer, and can be fairly easily liquidated for dollars as soon as you receive it, that make it a viable payment system, but not an actual currency.

Because you actually think there's 400$ billion in crypto, lololol, when you can quantitatively measure the actual dollar amount is less than five billion based on the last sell off, half of which is irredeemable tether. Paper market, with no liquidity backing it.


I actually sold all mine at 16k, and dont plan on buying at these prices. Might buy some more at 2k just for the lulz. Until then I'm happy making 200k+/annum in the futures markets.

You're trying to discount a 75% drop in price (probably 90% eventually) because bitcoin arbitrarily started at zero (no initial offering) and went up a few dollars 10 years ago. And you justify it because you believe bitcoin can only go up. Lololol, trust me, your not a realist, kiddo. You're a easily exploited gullible fool, who has fallen hook line and sinker for the marketing hype targeting people just like you.

And your too dumb to understand that none of that value exists, it's all paper value, there is no liquidity backing cryotos price.


Read what I said, I sold at 16k. I don't play around in illiquid markets.


I don't know if or when, that's not how trading works, I've got my price (for the lulz). If you think bitcoin can't get to 2000 then you either don't understand market dynamics, how asset pricing  works, or your very new to bitcoin. Most likely you're both.




Go learn how a bank's business model works, kiddo.  Banks make money through lending at a higher rate than the interbank rate, in the case if the US the Fed Funds Rate, and they can borrow as much as they want at this rate as long as they are able to find enough debtors. That's just the commercial banking side, the other end is investment banking and brokering for private clients/financial institutions. Banking was one of the best performing sectors last year, as banks raked in record profits, which are still growing. 
Your argument that "money in crypto = money not in banks therefore crypto is affecting the banks bottom line" is something a five year old child would come up with, a five year old who doesn't understand how the banking industry actually works. There is never a shortage of money for a bank as they can just top off their reserves at the interbank rate. The only way to actually harm a banks bottom line would be if people stopped financing, which as crypto has shown us will never happen, lol how ironic.
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:21:49
Your entire argument rests on a heavily marketed sound bite statement, "but there's only 21 million bitcoin", which like I said, doesn't matter at all. It doesn't matter if no one wants those bitcoin. The only thing that gives bitcoin any fiat value is speculation on future suckers, it's a casino. Bitcoin has no real world use to drive real world demand. It's fiat value is paper value, manipulated up last year, it doesn't exist, there's not enough liquidity to cash even 1% of people out. You and the rest of the lower intelligence crowd incapable of critical thinking have been taken for a ride, kiddo, taken for a ride by people who are much smarter than you and can exploit your stupidity.

When a CEO dumps his stock, who's buying on the other end. Does that person know that the stock is about to tumble, is there anyway for anyone in the public to have access to this privileged information. What about when the CEO buys back in later on, I know anarcho capitalists are fine with this sort of exploitation of the public through privileged information. Guys like John Rockefeller built their fortune on this type of manipulation. If you believe in an unregulated free market, than you have to accept this sort of behaviour as reasonable, it seems you do, but than you also have to accept that guys like Jordan Belfort are not fraudsters and just reasonable market participants.


Because you live in a country governed by the legislature. Even the crypto markets will eventually be regulated. Any rational participant in the market who doesn't plan on exploiting others, would want regulations to prevent others from frauding them. If you don't like that than you can go somewhere that allows complete market freedom, I hear [Saint Kitts]( is nice, you can buy a citizenship plus bonus: no income taxes.

Do you even know why inflation happens? It's all supply and demand. If there is increased demand for goods and services then prices will go up for those goods and services. Increased demand = businesses raise prices. Wage increases, more jobs, tax cuts, and low loan rates are what increase demand because this gives people more money to spend. That's why inflation is considered a sign of a healthy economy, you always want to see some inflation.
Also 100 years ago there was no minimum wage and the average hourly wage in the US was $1.28

Money is a means of exchange for goods and services. That's all. It is not and should not be an investment. It can be used to purchase an investment, but that's all. 
The Fed has not bought any paper assets since 2014, that's how they "create" new money, and is actually tapering they're 4.5 trillion balance sheet from after the financial crisis along with hiking interest rates, so the money supply is actually getting tighter in the US. And the banks who sell assets to the Fed aren't just allowed to go around buying up assets like real estate and securities with that money, they can only loan it to businesses, average consumers, or another bank.

I can buy AAA corporate bonds and get a 4% a year GUARATEED return for 20 years, when they mature I get the entire principle back. Very little risk plus a fixed return every year. With interest rates going up treasury yields are coming back, soon you can get 4% a year fixed on Tbonds which are virtually risk free. This is called a store of value for your money, not a shiny rock or a ponzicoin whose value depends on new speculators coming in to gamble and deciding not to take profits.
