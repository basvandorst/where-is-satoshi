The 100 day moving average will continue to go higher each day, closer to where Bitcoin is stagnant. In two week the 100-day MA will be about $12K, a good point to bounce from.

Do you even know what market capitalization is, bro? :D
Sounds to me like you don't.... especially with that mind-set.

Bitcoin will always hold a significant market share, I don't disagree. I'm just saying Bitcoin is certainly being challenged due to increased competition. Just like Blackberry losing market share to Apple, there's room for both for a certain amount of time... but it certainly means increased competition in the shared space. The one that can adapt will come out on top.

The fact that the CoinPrice = MarketCap/Circulating Supply
Market cap directly effects the price of the coin, so it does matter. It matters a lot...  
The rest of your statement is speculative and conspiracy, not facts at all.

What wasn't obvious is which one would eventually have a higher market cap than Bitcoin... which is what this chart is pointing towards.  You can have 1400 cryptos with less than 1% market share, sure.. but that's not what's happening...

Because reddit account creation dates are directly related to intellect. Great observation, you caveman...

A few coins, Ethereum as an example, is gaining enough market share that it could soon have a larger dominance than bitcoin just by itself. Bitcoin is holding on because it's the medium between alt-coin trading. Many people are moving to Ethereum to trade and store value because it's starting to out-perform, faster, and cheaper.

Make a stable coin people can put their money into. There can be a small fee that goes to the church for the church-coin holding your money, the small fee is cheaper than taxes. ;)

If you HODL that it's going to just get rotten. Probably not the best think to represent your idea.

Things in that mall tend to die. Let's hope it's future is not like the rest.

Banks have been doing this for years, you're just now starting to worry? There's no other way to be federally regulated and approved without showing some form of ID so they can be sure to get some of that federal tax money.

Pretty sure Bitcoin and John McAfee's soul are linked. The two may have found recent lows, but they will be up, alive, and on cocaine again soon. Long live McAfee/Bitcoin.

Tracking charts like these could help over time to see accumulation and selloffs.

Exactly why viewing by busiest by sum and busiest by transaction would be better than viewing by overall largest account holder. :D

How is the SEC going to deny a Bitcoin ETF based possible off-shore manipulation yet they allow companies like Alibaba which are hosted in China, and China literally has the world and president's attention for currency manipulation?
