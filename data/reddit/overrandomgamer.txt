Got another 226$ :) were you able to grab any today?
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:23:04
I use it to buy silver, gold, and coins so I use it as currancy.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:17:29
Maybe we can get a dump pump going xD
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:11:35
I was holding over 15k in tron I got in at 30 some thing cents...
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:44:40
Alaska next pleez
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:16:52
Every once in a while do something to save money and pay off your debts. Then when all your debts are payed off when you save extra money toss it into BTC. Then if it tanks you only lost some of your extra money that you wouldn't have had if you dis your normal stuff anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:26:37
Try checking out AMPX they sell things for bitcoin but I dont know if they buy things with it. They are very reliable.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:46:45
I do both. When I got in I only used money I could afford to use (10k for numbers sake) but I would rather waste 5k on a fancy new car I dont need over a risky investment so I told my self when my 10k turns to 8k I'll pull out my 5 and consider the other 5k a loss.  The 5k i pulled out either waits to go back in if i feel like the price will go up or I spend it when i want something. 
If my 10k turned to 20k I told myself I would pull out my principal and do the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:55:21
I do like looking at mine as well. What kind of silver do you collect mostly?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:25:36
I'm really curious as to how day tradeing is bad.
I understand one can lose money but they can make it back as well. What I don't get is why most people see this as more risky then holding. when you hold it can go up or down just as likely as losing on day trades. 
I bought in right befor the dip. Then it dropped quite a few% But because I day Trade when the price was 9500 yesterday i was only down ~2.33483% and today im up over 11%
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:54:27
I'm haveing so much fun day tradeing. Sure there is risk but I recommend useing gdax and jumping right in. Learn how to use the markets and limit as well as the stop orders. YouTube it or use small amounts to figure out how to avoid the 100% fees. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:39:31
I assume everyone on the internet a guy unless stated otherwise and even then its iffy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:36:11
I only put money I can loose into it. If it hits 0.01 per coin tommorw I'll probably more annoyed with my family saying I told you so then the actual loss then I'll buy another $100 worth.
Im almost to the point I have my original investment back into cash and am only holding the profits anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:32:57
I'm prepared to loose everything I invested.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:14:19
What's FOMO mean?
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:09:55
I live in a small town in alaska. The closest legitament gold or silver buyer is over 230 miles away and his prices suck
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:59:24
He said ish 5 years is a long time and pretty easy to mix up especially the older he is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:48:46
I do 3cents lower than what I want to sell at. Works great for day tradeing on the walls because it might hit the wall then drop a little befor it tries to break the wall again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:04:15
Just let them be and grab the discount 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:00:44
Hey, I liked the read. Solid -A work
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:16:45
With my crystal ball
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:33:18
I agree it is a bad idea to invest with money you don't have, but I'll play the counter. 
Say I have 20k that I can afford to loose so I'm going to invest it into Bitcoin. If it goes up 10% I make 2k. That's pretty great, but if I borrow 10k more and invest a total of 30k I would make another 1k on the same 10% rise. But if bitcoin was to drop 50%, where I have a stop Order, I would be able to return my 10k and walk out with ~5k. Takeing only a 15k loss.
So why don't I do this If I'm willing to loose 20k anyway?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:07:33
Just untill Monday so i can put more into it
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:05:41
Can't you clame it as losses and make money? That's how it works with precious metals
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:24:35
This. And my GDAX MARKET fee is only 0.25%
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:03:27
When Bitcoin moves up or down I considerate profit or losses because if it goes up the value of my dollar goes down and vice versa.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:04:41
how is wanting to find benefits an issue?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:27:19
So put 50% of everything I have in and keep the other half out?
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:37:47
That's why I have aboit a 5k buffer im also willing to loose (I could do a 10k buffer)
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:42:47
The studs in my house are actually arranged to show the QR code when looked at by 38.6 degree angle from the south west.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:18:56
I can agree
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:16:16
I'd say 5
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:31:47
I am confident it will become widely accepted. But i was only able to buy in at 12k
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:11:46
I moved 10$ worth twice yesterday and payed no fees
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:28:13
I personally use it to buy silver
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:31:45
I pay no fees
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:53:00
I always say "doubled my principal" but investment sounds right as well. What one is more proper?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:24:06
what's that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:22:17
Well I just turned 18 in November so I was just finally able to buy bitcoin. I put 50% of my saveings I earned from working this summer, and now I'm makeing more then my parents monthly income. So when I'm walking though the house and any of my family pass by me we do the Mr. Crabs "money money money" thing. So I would say it feels pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:48:59
I can agree with this as well but It's also other people's choose to listen to my advice or not.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:10:38
Any one have a recommendation where the best place I can buy a few bundles of circulated hyper-inflated currency is?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:09:54
Definitely Bitcoin. As a person who often deals with gold and silver it's a pain in the ass a lot of time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:55:31
I am not doing that, I genuinely want to find benefits to a universal income and I haven't found any so I currently think it is a terrible idea. 
that and this is the first article I read on why we should have universal income: ( ) 
it lacks sources, it makes statements that are not true (I live in Alaska, the PDF is not a universal income, it is us being paid for our mineral rights.), and it fails to address counter arguments. I mainly want to know why universal income wont cause hyper inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:29:47
I bought 100$ ~10inch laptop/tablet. It's no gaming computer but it works great for school and day tradeing. It small enough to bring places and way easier to do work on than a tablet or phone.
I recommend the cheep small PC
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:44:50
Live and learn right. At least I like it for my collection anyway :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:34:00
I dont do just 25 a week because it stresses me out knowing i could be buying more on the dip.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:09:01
AMPEX accepts bitcoin and that is where I would spend most my extra cash befor they started accepting it. Now I convert my cash to bitcoin then I buy silver.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:01:31
Internal Revenue Service
They collect taxes
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:20:11
But how does that make it any worse to daytrade than to hold?
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:42:25
I keep my Bitcoin in The Exchange and yes I know that is stupid of me to do but I do avoid all fees.
You can sell the silver/gold if there is a demand for it but not always instantly. I'm one of two people out of my whole family that would accept silver or gold as payment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:39:17
What kind of art do you got for sale? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:29:38
I daytrade
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:10:30
Gold goes up and down in value a lot.  I first bought imto gold at over $1850 and oz so I really lost out on that.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:53:04
I would rather struggle than be the same as everyone.
Now that's just a personal opinion and u dont want to force that on others so either way I want an opt in/out option for any system or program.
What are the pros to a universal basic income? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:07:10
I wouldn't mind being a politician, I've actually unrealistically wanted to purchase a large amount of land and build a new country with a diffrent form of government. I would be perfectly happy helping set up the ideas and see how it plays out.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:22:01
Yeah, I day trade and overall I took a 132.46 loss today yet I still find it fun. My little brother and I have been haveing competitions to see who can make the highest/loose the lowest %
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:41:14
Yeah I'm not really sure how to move my bitcoin out of an exchange. 
I don't want people to borrow money for Bitcoin either. Im useing it to buy silver from AMPEX :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:22:17
I can buy and sell my bitcoins instantly for a ~0.25% fee or less. With silver I need to spend the time to find someone to buy it. If that person is not local I will need to ship it and if I accept PayPal there is another fee.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:02:27
I like anonymity. I prefer that if i was to change everything about me random people I later meet wouldn't be able to tell. 
Now I understand that if people really wanted to, they could get a lot of information about me. The avrage person on here will have trouble even finding my real name let alone my private information. But the more places in anonymity is lost the more chances someone avrage has to finding my private information and i dont like that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:04:36
I normally avoid fees completely. Where do you pay fees?
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:43:33
Ah that makes sense, thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:17:45
Or maybe he has a thing for shooting himself in the foot. No need to judge how other people find joy.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:26:21
I use GDAX to trade and I almost only limit sell (being a taker of maker of the market rather then the taker) on GDAX this kind of trade has 0% fees and the highest fee on gdax is 0.03%
It is still luck based though.
Also I just did the math and although I lost 132.46 today that was only down ~2.33%. The price of bitcoin was down ~5.27% from where my buy point 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:14:48
How often do you sell it?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:56:35
Great, thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:35:40
My sister finnally asked me to put in 50$ for her today after i had been trying to get her in for over a month. 18k and coinbase fees was a great start
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:11:14
In September I reseved a large paycheck for working the whole summer. When i got it I considered buying stocks or BitCoin but i ended up sticking with selling silver coins (I made about 500 a month buying and selling them for the past 2 years) I bought a large amount of Morgan silver dollars and a bunch of other silver then i got to bussy to sell all my supply. If i would have bought the same value of Bitcoins as what i payed for my silver id have over 50k more profit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:45:16
A derivative is an expression representing the rate of change of a function with respect to an independent variable.
We can take the equation f(x)= 7x^2 -4x + 6 and graph it.
Now we can find it's rate of change by finding it's derivative. We end up with 14x -4 that we can graph with the parent function and compare the f(x) to f'(x)
And now you know about all I remember about Calculus.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:39:00

I lost .04 tradeing today. You win some you like some. Today was deffinatly a gain.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:36:45
This was the first did since I was able to start buying  so I'm finnally happy about it!
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:05:56
I go from cash to bitcoin just to buy silver.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:27:56
My sister told me to do the tradeing for her because she is like this. I haven't traded any of it yet
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:39:03
Do you have any advice on how simply explain how bitcoin can hold value? My mom has a hard time with this especially she can't get over the idea that it isn't backed by anything.

I've been trying to verify a payment method since the 1st of this month. When I saw it hit 5,888 USD I wanted to buy 2 coins but wasn't able to.
I still havent figures it out.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:31:19
Nice explination
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:15:26
I may not be getting the tops and bottoms perfectly but i am pretty good at gaining at least 1% not then holding a day. I dont make the trades because i can't verify my payment method but i wright them down.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:57:49
Right now I'm at 0.00 BTC I wantes to buy for years but I wasn't 18. Now that im 18 I just set up my account and plan to get ~1.5 coins 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:10:03
I've been trying to buy for weeks especially at the 5888 mark but my payment methods wont verify xP
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:16:38
Gold or more often silver U.S. coins is what i invested in and it has payed off pretty well in the past year ~40% profit a month. I feel like this is a safer investment then bit coin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:14:57
Im looking for someone to sell me some through a paypal (Ill pay first)
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:36:50
Thank you! this makes a good point I hadn't realize.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:33:35
So why do you recommend staying away from day tradeing? And is there a limit on trades a day in GDAX? Would 10k be enough money?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:28:24
Thanks! I was wanting to see that data
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:54:03
I still am waiting to get actual coin but the purchase should go through soon. As I've been waitinh I've been keeping track of my would be trades and I'm still comeing out on top (unless I'm mistaken on how the tradeing works.) On the 23 when the price of the coin had a negitive 1.something% trend my would be trades added up to a little over 1.2678% growth.

People are there to take advantage and be taken advantage of. If everyone was equal nothing would ever happen.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:44:27
so it's not backed by anything diffrent then USD. How is it more reliable?
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:33:32
Avoid fees by useing gdax.com it is part of coin base so sign in with your coin base information.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:52:11
I've also grabbed my laptop and tryed verifying it on there. It ler me press continue but said the numbers do not match. If you find out how to fix it please let me know!

When I was not 13 in 2012 when a coin was around 15 or something I wanted to put my 50$ I got for my birthday into it but my parents wouldn't let me and so I started a saveings account instead. I still have that 50$ in that saveings account. I just turned 18 on the 1st so that's why I'm looking to buy it again :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:00:26

@_date: 2017-11-18 23:49:48
 I'm haveing this problem as well. I've typed in the numbers but it won't let me click continue like it is not an option. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:45:54
Yep, but it's probably because I'm the only person I know here locally in alaska that has a good supply of coins so I have very high demand and a pretty high supply from online. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:01:01
I didn't have a credit debit card so now one is on the way in the mail. Coin base is telling me the amounts it sent to my bank account are wrong. Any idea on how I could fix that?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:53:06
I've been playing it with 1 coin and so far I've been really lucky. The first day i started writing it down i immediately took $100 loss but then I made back enough to end the day on a 1.56% gain  when the trend was down 1.something.
