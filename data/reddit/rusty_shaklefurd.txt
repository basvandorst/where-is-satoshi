What you are referring to is a problem called [Zooko's triangle]( which states that electronic names cannot be simultaneously unique, decentralized and human-readable. Bitcoin has chosen to be securely unique and decentralized, but in doing so the addresses become hard for humans to comprehend. In order to have the unique names be human readable, Bitcoin would need to rely on centralized services.
The one solution I have heard in regards to this problem is Namecoin, which uses the blockchain technology to enable the attaching of GPG keys, email addresses, profile pictures, email addresses, bitmessage addresses and Bitcoin addresses to a secure, decentralized, unique username. [Here's an example of one,]( all of which is stored on the Namecoin blockchain and can be verified by anyone who has downloaded it.
Namecoin needs a lot of work, but as far as I can tell this is the only way to fix the problem without sacrificing the principles Bitcoin was built to uphold. Namecoin can do for DNS and PKI what Bitcoin has done for money, and has the potential to make full end-to-end web security as easy as downloading the blockchian.
There's no namecoin tip bot, but I will give enough to buy your own namecoin name if you give me an address :)

The word "bit" is already being used as shorthand for the word Bitcoin. If bit meant 1/1,000,000 bitcoin, we wouldn't be able to say "millibit" without getting it confused. Countries like Japan always use their lowest denomination (1 American Dollar is about 102 Yen) and they're getting along just fine.
Also, Bit is already a well defined word in computer science. I don't think it would be a good idea to try and adopt it.

The UK and US also have different population densities and median incomes... It's not really fair to say that the differences in their homicide rates are based on gun control entirely.
Homicide rates in the UK actually kept going up for more than five years after the 1997 Firearms Act banned ownership of handguns by citizens. [\(See page 11\)](

Hold on. Are you saying you want the design done by the same person as the printing? Most people printing t-shirts aren't going to do any less than 25 at a time, which is going to cost you way more than $80. If you only want one, than you're going to have to go with something like cafe press. If you're willing to pay enough for bulk, I could definately reccomend some people who would take bitcoins.
As for design, you aren't being very descriptive. You haven't mentioned colors, symbols... Anything. It would be rather hard to make a design just based on what you described here.

At ~$9/month, this seems like a great alternative to the $8/month that netflix charges, especially if you could allow people to stream media directly from the server.
Would users who pay for the service have their own user ID? Would you be able to rate and follow other users? I think it would be pretty cool to be able to pay people to rate/verify the quality of other people's submission for you. I'm sure we all know that feel of searching through various torrents trying to find a good one.
Another way I could imagine to make the service more awesome would be to provide some way to reward users for high-quality uploads. Maybe just by allowing tipping?
It seems like this has the potential to be a good alternative to netflix and TPB, and if you did it right I could definitely imagine it drastically improving the state of the bitcoin economy. I'm excited to see what you come up with.

OP isn't saying that the government will say 'welp bitcoins" and collapse. The recording industry didn't go 'welp bittorrent' and give up. The recording industry *failed* at being as good as bittorrent and providing people with music. In the same way, the government is going to fail at providing as useful a currency as bitcoin. This is only bad for people who make their money on managing and distributing USD, and I couldn't give two shits about them.

The only thing going for the Apple logo is that it's an apple. The value of a logo isn't based on how much information it represents. All that matters is that it's recognizable and able to be associated with the product.
I think the biggest hurdle to Bitcoin right now is actually that people don't see it as money. I don't see how equating Bitcoin to money could possibly hurt it.

The whole point of branding is that it is recognizable. There's no point in making a logo if it's just going to be scrapped for another logo in half a year. Bitcoin's original logo may not be optimal, but when making a new logo, you have to consider not only how good the new logo is, but also how easy it will be to convert other bitcoin users to the new logo. If our community has two logos, that means that either logo is half as effective as it would be if it were the only logo.

A good government would look to empower it's people, but that would mean avoiding democracy. Any political power someone receives through the state is by definition forcefully taken from someone else.
The bottom line is that individuals know better than others what is in their best interest. If you have the choice between figuring out what to do by having the people haggle with what they own, or figuring out what to do by having everyone get together and vote on every matter, the first is by far the better option.
The best government is one which establishes the most fair and useful standard of property rights, and enforces that standard well. The people will fair far better in a society where their ability to keep the products of their labor, choose who they want to associate with, and trade what they please without state interference, than they will in a society where others dictate what they may our may not do at whim.

I see how laundering, lending and moving capital would be easier for them with bitcoin than without, but those people would only be able to do it slightly easier with bitcoin. Other people, the good guys, would be able to do it *way* easier with bitcoin. The fact that the [barrier to entry]( is lowered due to bitcoin means that the good guys will get a bigger market share in the long run. I don't think this is really a problem.
As for bitcoins making collecting money easier... How is that? If you can buy from a grower on silk road, you have no need for drug lords, and they lose their power. Would a warlord raiding a town rather try to steal bitcoins or banknotes? If the state can't print money or tax the populace effectively, how will it pay for the military industrial complex or defense contractors? If the bankers don't have your money, how can they gamble it away?
