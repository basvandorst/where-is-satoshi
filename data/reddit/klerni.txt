Ask questions if you have any and maybe together we might find solution

I'm fighting with it longer and longer and it might be simply encrypted private key, which is not recognizable by anything yet.. Bitcoin core for example is showing me invalid private key encoding code -5 ..
So question is how to decrypt private key if I have password.

I don't know details as my friend created it many years ago. I have password and private key, which is not recognizable even with bitcoin core. I tried decrypt at [ , but it also doesn't work . [Bitaddress.com]( says it's invalid.. Looks like because it's encrypted and I don't know how to decrypt it.. I'm now not sure what format it is :|
Key start with 5K and it's 51 characters

My friend did it and I really don't remember. Asking him now

when I put it into electrum to sweep, "sweep" button just doesn't work. I cannot click it, which mean electrum doesnt recognize key..
It must be in some kind of different format .. Small tip, wallet is from 2010.

coinbase - extracted before they were an exchange
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:10:07
Checked, all good and still doesn't work

I have public wallet as well... and bitcoins are there...
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:09:53
yes didn't help. I mean it created priv key to wrong address. 
While I still have password . It need to be encoded somehow

Wrote DM
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:02:57
but actually true, if you have good solution let's go DM and I'll show you what I'm recovering

I've checked check sum and I dont know why it's little bit different. Major part is the same but 3 characters are different.. What with that?? Can I brute force priv key ?
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:01:02
The only thing I know is that it's extracted from coinbase when it was not an exchange yet (mining).
Maybe they had different encoding or encryptions
