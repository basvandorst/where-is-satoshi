Yeah, I don't see how this guy cannot see that. There was a *reason* people started to recommend against running a full node, they didn't do it 'just cuz.'

The same reason that doing them through natural means is bad except the difference is immediate as opposed to a gradual 'honing' if you will. Just to use an example take potatoes. They contain toxic compounds but have largely been breed out. Namely I'm referring to solanine which is present in the green flesh/skin of the fruit as well as the leaves. Now with selective breeding we could increase the amounts of solanine if we did not k ow it was a bad thing. Likewise with gene splicing or w/e techniques we use you could go from having no solanine to suddenly introducing the production of a toxic byproduct. Its all about what reactions and effects the new genes cause. I'm not against GMOs and generally they are harmless, but its not remotely so black and white and I truly see no reason to hide the fact that a product is a GMO.

I feel like you're closing your eyes and ears to the (insanely) obvious here. Think about this one simple question. *Why* do you think people stopped recommending to run a full node? 
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:55:39
They don't have unlimited time, only the rest of their life, or if they pass it on the rest of the universe. A strong password will easily beat the first mark and though we don't know how long the universe will exist (it may be infinite even) odds are it will even outlast that, this is with current processing power so not strictly applicable if we're really talking about trying to crack a wallet.dat for a century.
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:13:05
I'm sure there are some calculators out there that could tell you how long it would take to crack with a certain amount of processing power, but I don't know of any off hand. A general rule of thumb I'd go by is 8 characters minimum, at least one symbol and at least one letter. If it doesn't contain a word in the dictionary that's much better. Keep in mind that's the minimum I'd recommend, not the minimum to last you X amount of time or something. It *should* take a long time either way unless the person knows you and can thus severely limit the test patterns to the point that there is literally no reason to worry about it.

Go on... what spurred the creation of light clients... 
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:29:46
What do you mean what is the conclusion? Do you mean solution? I'm not sure on a long term solution, I think we're just hoping hardware and (somewhat) bandwidth keeps pace for the time being until someone comes up with a software solution. I'm just saying I don't see the point in this entire post and he's missing the obvious. I don't have a solution, I just feel like he's seeing an extra problem/complication that never existed kind of. Unless I'm misunderstanding his point anyway, but other people seem to agree.
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:06:05
Yes I'm joking.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:18:14
Exactly.. so why are we here? In mathematics this is the simple transitive property. Whether you want to say node adoption decreased because of an increased block size or because of the creation of light clients is pointless as they're effectively the same thing.
@_date: 2015-06-10 22:26:23
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:06:49


I believe they do though and for the implication present here there is no distinction between block size and blockchain size. It's not a direct result of increasing the block size, but it *is* a direct result of the reason to increase the block size to begin with (an increase in transactions/blockchain size). It's like most industries, the bigger it gets the fewer people can actually enter the market. This is a different mechanism preventing that over an economical one, but the presentation is very similar.


I was never arguing that either, my only point in saying that at one time consumers could feasibly run a full node is because consumers will always be the lowest members in the community. You have people who want to run a full node, be it for professional reasons or just to support the network, who cannot as the cost to do so increases, that's all I'm saying as far as that goes, and I'm not concerned about it (not yet, maybe in some years time).

@_date: 2015-06-10 21:28:19


Ha, well true in a literal sense, but I mean in the context I said it they mean the same (that's what I meant by 'you know what I meant' or w/e I said). In other words I was saying that *only* costs go up (or profits go down if you prefer), those costs being hardware, electricity, and (maybe) bandwidth. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:52:16
They may increase, but not significantly. I'm not saying the problem of an increasing blockchain is an avoidable one, it's not. I'm just saying that light weight clients were created and used *because* of this inevitable inflation of the blockchain. You can play around with block sizes all you want, but so long as you use blockchain technology there's going to come a time when running a full node is not feasible to the consumer.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:52:51
I feel like you know exactly what I'm saying and are just nit picking now. 'Industry' is just a generic term, maybe I could have chosen a better one, but I even said I'm not talking in an economical sense to make it clear what I meant and profit or costs are effectively the same thing in this case, if your costs go up your profit goes down... obviously.
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:15:24
I'm not arguing against increasing the block size, in fact I'm for that (I wasn't speaking on it at all tho). I'm just saying that what the OP is saying is just an obvious relation. He's arguing that nodes were dropping because of the introduction of light clients while I'm saying the whole reason light clients and the demand for the came to exist in the first place is directly related to the increasing block size.
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:48:28
I was never arguing we should.

@_date: 2014-10-05 07:31:48
Again though it's all relative to when you first noticed bitcoin and/or bought in. To me bitcoin has a huge adoption. For me it was big when you could actually buy things, now we have major retailers accepting it, atms in some locations (albeit select), brick and mortars accepting it, etc, there's so much more I'm not thinking of and it keeps growing. Even if it fails at this point, to me, bitcoin would still be a success just for the precedents it's set as a digital currency alone.
@_date: 2014-09-01 20:26:11
That's not what I said, but I feel that's a pretty fair comparison. I would compare bitcoin more so to credit/debit cards which are more secure because you can lose the card itself and your money is safe, plus they're more difficult to steal. However credit card theft and fraud happens all the time, I'd imagine just as often, if not more so, than bitcoin theft. My point is just that you cannot compare a currency to a service provided for other currencies. There's no reason you cannot have bitcoin banks even.

Isn't any btc being converted to USD being done so because someone else is converting USD (or another currency) to btc though? Granted if there are more people selling than buying it'd drop the price, but I assume most people that are spending btc likely either have a lot of btc, bought the btc specifically to spend, or plan to replace it in the near feature. Plus every new business to support btc will drive the demand and awareness of it.
Bitcoin is becoming mainstream to the extent that a lot of people have heard of it, but it's still quite new and has a long way to go, most people don't know much more *than* the name for instance, they don't know how it works much less own any. At this point I say any adoption is good whether it causes spending or hoarding.
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:49:40

The more distributed and supported a currency is generally the more stable it is. A big player drops out of the btc market and it can have a noticable effect on the market value alone. With the USD you can lose quite a few large corporations and banks even with little change on the usds value.

It's illegal to pass the fee onto you as agreed to in their contract. If by 'pass the fee on' you mean it's calculated into total business costs then sure, but that fee would then have been passed on to you regardless if you paid with a CC, cash, or bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-10-16 19:59:20
The same thing is true with any currency though. You're getting infrastructure confused with the currency itself. There's no reason you cannot store your bitcoins in a bank or that that bank could not insure your bitcoin against fraud, theft, etc. Likewise there's nothing inherent about USD that protects you from any of that either, if I take 20$ out of your pocket it's gone, Uncle Sam isn't going to print you a new one; that's exactly why people choose to keep their USD in banks.

All currencies are made up. The biggest difference between fiat and btc is simply that btc is decentralized and was rather well planned out. Most fiat were just kind of patch work to feed/create an economy at best (and with all of the flaws that come with such practices), or a deliberate and corrupt method of control at worst. Bitcoin was designed from the ground up from scratch. It really does have a lot of promising ideas and potential.

It's not that difficult to hide things from the IRS. If you have 20btc in a wallet that they know you own and send it to another wallet until/unless they do some pretty fancy detective work there is no way to prove you possess the second wallet. If you're careful in the first place they wouldn't know you possess the first wallet even. The only way they can really track you is by matching up purchases with retailers, so keep your btc in one wallet, think of it as your bank, and for each purchase transfer it to a different wallet before making the purchase. They have no way of knowing that you didn't just buy those btc right then to make said purchase and that you're just buying them from the same guy all the time. That's just the most basic way to obscure what you're doing even, you can get drastically more complicated and secure than that. I don't see why we'd be any more worried about btc retailers telling the IRS we purchased items than cash or debit card retailers, which currently does not happen, why would things be any different?

I bought into bitcoin at a peak of 27$(as in that's the *most* I have paid for it at any one time). I'm not saying fuck everyone else who jumped on the hype train later when it reached triple digits, but just realize that it's very subjective to say the bubble has popped. The bubble itself is very subjective, if you even view it that way for that matter. I consider myself jumping in mid way, I definitely wasn't there for the beginning, but from this perspective bitcoin is well past the bubble stages and it's a viable currency, it's not going to die. 
Sure if you bought in a year ago maybe your bubble is feeling a bit bursted, but just think of this in the big picture. Look at how many people are using bitcoin. It's amazing to me it's worth 1$/btc quite honestly, I can't even comprehend my thoughts on the fact that it reached $1200. People are confusing their personal expectation, which often fail, with what is actually happening, and what has happened. Bitcoin has made it. There's probably no one that can quite be sure quite *where* it's made it, but it's a thing, it's not going away anytime soon.

The performance overhead, both processing and bandwidth wise, is pretty negligible for anything that should really be encrypted, namely text. If we start encrypting audio and video frame by frame then sure, that overhead will be noticed, but as it is it would literally be transparent to 99.9% of people. Losing things isn't really a problem, for the most part it's just part of a program or something, you can 'lose' lots of stuff, but it's unlikely to happen unless your hard drive is failing or you have a habit of deleting completely random files.

My point was that I think you might have selective reading in the case. I hear more often, far more often, the exact other side. People complain that Americans say 'us' and then non americans get offended that the internet includes more than just americans. You don't typically hear us walking around outside referring to ourselves as americans in most places where an 'us' or 'we' would make just as much sense.

Sure, but there was arguably a demand for online shopping before online shopping existed. People knew what shopping was, it's not hard to grasp buying things over the internet whether the technologies were in place to make it possible or not. 
Most people have no idea what bitcoin, digital currency, etc are and cannot understand how they even work. Likewise there is not going to be much development for bitcoin without a demand for it. Bitcoin is still small. You need to approach it from both ends, bitcoin *does* need marketing. To narrow it down and say marketing bitcoin and creating public awareness does nothing to help it grow is beyond short sited imo. You can pump millions into development and yet without creating public awareness it will remain confined to techies, investors, and drug dealers.

And fees don't go away. Bitcoin doesn't impose fees per se, but vendors such as coinbase do whom (I believe) dell is interfacing with. That's like saying there is no fee for using USD and then extending that statement to VISA since it's a service to transfer USD.
On that note though the price fluctuation doesn't matter as Dell are likely converting their btc to usd after each transaction through a service such as coinbase, such services are not free however. Cheaper than credit card fees maybe, but not free.

Everything is a metric? So how much my shit smelled this morning effects the price of drugs? I know that's not what you meant, but seriously though, supply and demand is important, but my point was more so that things should be priced fairly and accordingly; I feel this should apply more to drugs more than a lot of things even, say televisions, especially psychedelics and empathogens.

I agree, well.. kind of (me and everyone I know unsub from things we lose interest in, but I'll take your word for it that we're abnormal), but you still are just making an entirely unfounded assumption there. You just basically said 'we have no way to measure interest... so we're just going to make up this metric here and call it losing interest.'

Ha, I don't believe it dropped after I bought in. I bought at 17 and a week later, maybe two, (because I deleted my coins by mistake : /) again at 27. Over some amount of time (I forget, a number of months) I followed btc with intense interest as it went up to.. I dunno, maybe a peak of 80$ in which my interest started to fade. I literally did not check again for some time. 
So then I lose my job, I'm broke, and I think 'Oh yah, I've got some btc, wonder what they're worth?' 970$!!! Oh... well that's sweet. So I just so happened to cash out most of them between 970 and 1200$, which wasn't that much, maybe 3 btc. I think I cashed out my last .4 or so once it crashed for around 6-700/btc, but *damn* good timing on my part still, totally luck though for the most part. Definitely helped me get by in rough times however, thanks btc. I still have a little bit left which is probably still worth more than what I initially bought in for.

Rarely do I find it's a problem to close them either, if I cannot part with some I'll just bookmark those if I find they've been open for more than ~24 hours or so.

I don't think he was a drug dealer other than selling a somewhat small amount of mushrooms at some point, he didn't grow, manufacture, or even distribute them, so a drug lord would not be the right term.

I *would* say they are both fighting for good causes, though one was clearly, primarily, trying to do so for profit (and nothing wrong with that), where as the other is more of a martyr and patriot.

You covered it by saying, 'If your business just started it's bound to fail so paypal saved you the effort.' I don't see how... I just don't.. I don't know what to say to that if that's a serious statement about starting a business.


I'm not saying it's hard to use another payment processor, I'm saying it may not be an option for your customer base. Btc is obviously an alternative for instance, but if none of your customers want to or are unable to use it then it doesn't make much sense to offer it, much less rely on it.

How was I supposed to interpret it? I mean I know what you meant now, but I don't see how I was supposed to get that from it. I'll try to break it down how I interpreted it though.


So I read this as you have three categories. Either the business is on the side, it just started, or the business owner would have driven it into the dirt. If you fit in one (or more I guess) of those categories then paypal saved you months of work [by killing your business].


Definitely, but many of us have no option. A lot of business owners start out working on the side after getting maybe a few thousand saved up from their meager day job. Sure more would be better, but it is what it is, we have to make due. 


You had enough capital until paypal froze it all though is the point. They have the arbitrary discretion to essentially do whatever they want to with your money. You can say you shouldn't use paypal, but if you don't have a choice then, well, you know, that's not really worth mentioning. It's like telling someone to drink when there's no water. Keep in mind this is the btc subreddit, we're about controlling our money so bringing up issues where others unfairly 'manage' our funds due to the financial systems that control fiat, which we are forced to use, is the point of the post.

Unfortunately if the staff cannot do it then it's effectively the same thing and they should be flagged. It's like saying you accept credit cards but your credit card processor is down. I would maybe try to tell management or something too though to make sure they know there is interest and a problem that needs to be fixed.
@_date: 2015-07-03 00:13:13
Who are you working for that has btc? Are you saying to leave the country and work for bitcoin? If you expect a Greecian to work for it from another Greecian, well... you didn't think that one through very far. Where does the govt get bitcoin from and what is their incentive to convert to it? The whole reason Greece is in this problem is due to a corrupt government, I doubt it's remotely in their interest to persuade people to use bitcoin. Did you put any thought into this or are you just banging your head on the keyboard?

I don't know. I mean I doubt OP's business is *failing* because of this, but even if it's only 10% of his funds if he is constantly reinvesting his money then that's 10% less profit he's making while it's locked up. Even if it's 2% that's 2% too much, it shouldn't be happening in the first place.

Yeah, something doesn't add up. In GPB it comes to ~343$/btc, in euros (if for w/e reason he tranfers to those) it comes to $242 which is cheap, but maybe possible, but still unlikely (why would he use euros?), and of course if it's usd, well it's $220 which is way too cheap. I do think this story is a viral marketing campaign, maybe he purchased the btc months ago and we've found a hole in his story.
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:41:37
I don't think you can blame the political system. Take the US for example, have we really voted *anyone* in to office when it's literally a binary choice for all intents and purposes? As a politician you largely buy your way into the primaries and after that it's not about who is the best candidate, it's about who can best manipulate the voters and voting system. I'd hardly say we 'elected' anyone.

Yah, I didn't realize their retirement age is so low so it did benefit them. I'm not sure I feel 67 is a healthy retirement age either which is what it is in the US atm, that seems like the other extreme, but you're right there.
 Just because they 'elected' these people is not enough imo though, I don't know much about the greecian political climate but if it's anything like the US I would not say we've had a free election in its entire history through one means or another.

Don't most monetary currencies operate similarly though?

Yeah, I agree, it's a problem with paypal just as much as bitcoin or anything else.


Maybe, but are there many like that? Certainly no one with much wealth, eg business owners (non shady ones anyway), preferred to keep thousands stuffed in their mattress or even in gold or an offshore account. The economy is pretty much fucked for the time being, it's too late. Even those that do have euro in their mattress, or any other currency, buying btc is prohibitively more difficult when you can't transfer funds very readily.

I don't see why that matters. Bitcoin will at some point deal with inflation as well, and likewise in 1914 I would imagine people were a lot more self sufficient than they are now. Consumerism was created, not a necessity, it's not as if people needed wages. Bread may have decreased 4x in price over the years or been expensive at first because in 1914 it was very common to bake your own bread. I'm not saying you're wrong that this chart is painting an innaccurate picture though simply because as you say it's not factoring for inflation and purchasing power which are much more meaningful, but I disagree that it says anything about bitcoin.

edit: Oh! Nevermind. Well I suppose, but I'm still a bit confused on what is a 'crooked merchant' in this case? I mean the crooked merchant must have a verified paypal account, why does it matter if the buyer does or not? They got ripped off paypal should give them their money back if it's recoverable. That's why I don't use paypal though, I've never had them help me out. There was even one time an outright fraudulant charge was issued on my account, I hadn't even logged in for months, and they wouldn't even respond to my email or ticket, simply closed it.

As the one guy says your best bet is to do it in the router, that way it will be blocked forever for all devices without worry. I would imagine it would be under something like firewall, but may parental controls as he said. If you cannot get that to work try windows firewall, that should be pretty easy to do as well. You can test if they're blocked by trying to ping one of them, though make sure you can ping it first before blocking to ensure icmp actually works and that you have a valid ip/server.

I don't think his point was that they intentionally disrupted the network, just that they didn't care. Their 'service' is a malicious one and self serving, that is it's nothing but a parasite. You might think all services are like that, most businesses only exist to 'make money,' but that's not the same because they are still providing an actual benefit and rely on the customer to stay in business. There's a give and take as opposed to just a take. If they were an actual service and unintentionally caused a problem they would be astronomically more inclined to resolve it, not to mention to publically address it. I garuntee when they do talk on this it will be a bunch of non-explanations.
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:02:56


You have to be wrong, that doesn't make sense. The miner payout per transaction is the transaction fee that you include with your transaction, which is no where near 4$, you can even not include a fee at all and while your transaction will be processessed slower it will still happen within a couple hours at most, last I tried anyway. Are we talking about the same thing? Where would the rest of that 4$ come from? Where are you getting the 1 million miner payout for that matter?


Btc is just more convenient. You could charge an amount to your credit card, say store 50$ into vimeo and then use that 'bank' to make micro transactions, but it's not nearly as easy, or cheap, to transfer back and forth if you wanted to withdraw it. For the consumer there's not much of a difference, assuming they make it easy for you to withdraw, but for the service provider it's a lot more costly. Btc is just as much of a headache if you don't already have any of course, perhaps even more so, but I think we're assuming we already have them given the subreddit.

In just the last 50 years look at the shit our government has done, destabalized nations, started completely unprovoked wars, facilitated if not directly sold massive, *massive* amounts of cocaine and likely heroin to the entire US population, tested various harmful drugs and chemicals on US citizens with *and without* their permission, this includes outright forcible abduction of citizens at times, of course spy on *everyone* which is a blatent violation of rights, trained, armed, and funded terrorists, even direct terrorists of the US (bin laden to name a prominant figure) do I need to go on?

Wow, I didn't realize the market was that high/big. Now where do you get the 2.7 transactions per second from? Regardless though that doesn't equate to 4$/transaction, I mean maybe 4$/per transaction is generated through mining, but if so that's because those are *new* coins being mined, it doesn't cost anywhere near 4$ to make a transaction. Once all the coins have been mined that $/transaction will drop dramatically, I'm not sure how you will incentivize miners at that point though, perhaps transaction fees will rise, but those are two seperate things.

I don't see where you're getting 4$ per transaction from, but there's ways of using bitcoin without flooding the blockchain for micro transactions and it would make sense to set up such a system if micro transactions are a large part of your business model. With credit cards you have to pay a high fee regardless and there's nothing reasonable you can do to forgo it internally that are as elegant as btc.

I don't think those are quite analogous because one is expected and has mostly legitament uses. The other is intentionally decietful and makes use of pitfalls in the protocol by spoofing itself being thousands of nodes when in fact it's only one. Do you not see how one is nefarious and one is not? 
A more proper analogy would be something like stealing users data from other domains before web browsers implimented cookie domain policies or something. I'm not sure if that's a real example, I would hope not, but hopefully it demonstrates my point.

It's possible to produce malware, take over computers with massive botnets, steal all kinds of personal data, resources, etc. That's all been possible since the beginning of the internet, is it really a big deal? So some botmasters are offering it as a service, it's a free world now.

You can make any wallet use tor yourself though, which I would personally trust more than using a wallet's own implimentation that is now tied to some shady dealings. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:17:46
What kind of logic are you guys using here? Is it ok for the government to spy on me because I can use tor if I want anonyminity? Is it ok to shoot me because I could wear a bullet proof vest if I cared about not getting shot? 
This kind of thinking really goes to show how corrupt the general populace's minds have become. I'm not saying that to fault you guys at all, but just think about it objectively how over the past century how much societies views have shifted on matters of privacy, personal respect, etc. So many people feel like if there's a profit motive anything is justifiable, and I don't mean justifiable if they are recieving the profit, but they'll defend someone elses right to make a profit no matter the detriment to their own person even.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:54:55
I think he did bring up a good point, though I do agree with you (ehm.. and myself?) that I don't think it is really an issue and as I said earlier even if it were there are ways to mitigate it. If it became popular to do micro transactions for instance I could definitely see a problem arising, if such mitigation tactics were not used anyway, but likewise bitcoin core could adapt for that. I'm not sure how well, but the size of the blockchain is not fixed so that could be changed to allow more transactions per second if need be, I'm not sure of other possibilities, but I'm sure they exist. Bitcoin was designed to grow after all and there's already been at least one hard fork to the blockchain to resolve such issues afaik.
@_date: 2015-03-17 22:42:25
No, I get what you're saying now, but that doesn't mean a transaction 'costs' 4$ a transaction. The cost is spread across the entire network, minus the transaction fee of course. I suppose it was just a matter of semantics, but it confused me all the same. Hopefully you're not too annoyed to answer another question, but isn't the rate at which transactions are processed entirely dependant upon the mining pool? There is no hard limit that sets it at 250K transactions/day is there? The reason I ask is that it stands to reason that the more popular btc, the more adopters, you'd likewise have more mining happening. Wouldn't it be possible to grow with the demand?
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:21:33

I'm not trying to argue, I'm trying to understand, it doesn't make sense to me. If miners are *paid* 4$ *per transaction* yet I am paying 5 cents on a transaction where does the other 3.95$ come from? Are some people paying 100$ a transaction to make the average out to 4$?

Credit card theft != identity theft. I have never been asked to enter my social security number when making a purchase either. There are much easier ways to steal your identity, and there are various ways to 'hack' credit cards in real life such as reading nfc chips from a distance or using a CC swiper, or software (or both), that steals the data while looking like an authorized transaction. You're at no more at risk using a credit card online than you are in real life, and no, I haven't known anyone that has had their identity stolen because it's not very common. I've known plenty of people who've had their CC numbers stolen and it wasn't a big deal. 
If you want to pirate things I don't care, I pirate things, sometimes for political reasons, sometimes because I simply don't want to spend the money. No one's judging you for that and if they do who cares, everyone can see through your backwards ass logic though.

I had at one point started the client so it created all the .dat files, including the default wallet.dat. Shortly after I decided to try and see if bootstrap.dat would bring it in sync any faster so I deleted all the files. I don't really know how it happened though, I just cannot find a copy of my wallet so at some point I'm assuming I moved it into the config folder and then not realizing it deleted it to load bootstrap.dat. Forgot I copied it apparently and likely used a mv where I should have used a cp. Basically a series of small fuckups with huge, well.. 50$, consequences.
edit: I discovered it when I deleted it all again, this time backing up the wallet.dat that was in there only to find out it was empty so it dawned on me I had overwritten/deleted it at some point in the last ~24h.

Haha, his only thngs against btc, well besides the price flucuations which just shows a lack of understanding, are things that apply to fiat currency too, except you can't backup fiat currency. If you give someone 5$ there is no way to reverse that, sure with payment processors there may be, but btc is not a payment processor and neither is the usd, they are currencies. I actually lost my physical wallet last month and I'd rther have lost my wallet.dat because I don't store my id, debit card, and a bunch of other shit in my wallet.dat, though if I did I'd just grab one of the offsite backups I've made.

Fair enough, without going through those thread would you mind summing up the general reasons why? I'm guessing it's along the lines of wanting btc to not be associated with current currencies and wanting it to stand on it's own if you will, and putting the ER would make it look more like a simple investment opportunity than a currency. I can agree with that mindset too.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:52:39

It is a currency, to people who accept bitcoin, that is to say not many, probably very rarely the same people youwant to send a WU transfer to. Monopoloy money is also a currency btw, just in the game of monopoly. The people who accept it are almostalways playing monopoly, and just like btc, there's currently a pretty limited number of things you can buy with it compared to USD. So to compare the two 'services' it doesn't seem fair unless you put them on the same grounds.
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:37:22
So how does it work if the protocol doesn't support it? For instance to send the client a reciept, how does that work? I don't imagine the sender knows the clients IP or vice versa, if they did wouldn't that defeat a large part of the reason people use bitcoin in the first place? Is it moving away from decentralization and having a server to hold these messages now? We need details, it's not very clear.

I don't think there would ever be a point of 'true anarchy' because it's technically impossible, but I thinkwhat the OP was proposing, and I'm not against (not that I'm for) is letting the goverment crumble and slowly rebuilding it 'naturally' however it may play out. In other words we don't have a solution, but we know what doesn't work so why do we keep holding it together?
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:21:27
I disagree that we need their support. I think after it gains enough public support, which could be argued we already have enough (though I would not personally say that we're there yet), you do not need the banks to support it, and government likewise is not important at all. Some banks will likely support it to gain business as it gains popularity, likely smaller ones and credit unions, while the big ones will fight it as they're doing now. Eventually the banks and govts will have no choice but to accept it once they see it's not going away and their virtually left with no choice. Even your average person today is starting to lose faith in the major banks as well as their own government so if this trend continues convincing the masses might just happen on its own. Also it's important to keep in mind that you do not need the major first worlds to support bitcoin (or whatever cryptocurrency), they might do everything they can to lock it out, but even if risng nations adopt it not only would that be a leg up, but unless we're going to completely embargo them there will have to be some route to trade with them. 
Furthermore I could easily see the US and their banks doing something like China has done to shut down btc, but ultimately unless they can control the internet it's not going to change much in the long run. It might prevent the average joe from exchanging them as easily as in the past, but your big btc holders/traders will not be deterred and new services or methods will always pop up. To me preventing the rise of crypto currency is akin to preventing drug use, except it's dramatically easier to hide your cryptocurrency use and I cannot see the penalties being anywhere near that of our draconian drug laws so there's really not much deterring people from using it even if it became outright illegal (which I really cannot see happening). The government and banks can only do so much before people lose all trust and respect for their authority and in our current political and economic client they've already lost a lot of credibility with the people. I'd give it at least a 1:5 chance or so of happening in the next century.
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:10:53
Is that a defense of fractional reserve banking or are you just explining how it works? I know how it works, or at least I feel I do, but to me it seems unsustaonable, not to mention unfair. Imo youshould not mke a profit without providing a good or service, I don't consider lending money a real service in itself (that is not to say it should be done for absolute nothing though). I'm not against banks mind you, but I think their profit margins are rediculous, and for everything you stated above I just don't see how it justifies FRB. I *am* against banks in their current form.
It technically gives more capital in the pool to manufacture things with, but it could be done without it. I could see such a system being used to stimulate a budding economy, but with plans to move away from it. For a long term economy I just can't see how it is a sane practice, it's bound to collapse on itself one day, it might be a long time, but it's inherently unstable as I percieve it. Eventually you'll have things lent out too far and everyone ends up working with worthless money, it's already happening around us. Admitidly maybe I just don't know how it works as well as I think I do though.

So the x.509 certs are run from the vendors server and communication then takes place from server to client and vice versa? I don't like that idea really, it's fine for goods exchange, you're breaking anonyimity anyways since the goods have to be attached to a name and address or you won't recieve them, but as far as btc is concerned it should remain decentralized and pseudoanonymous, that's one of the major drawing points to it. This seems like the beginning of a mess of a protocol, even if this isn't tied into the protocol that imo makes it even worse, it's almost like forking the protocol by adding an extra layer which imo should either be in the protocol or not included at all. If a 3rd party came and added this feature to their client that would be one thing, but it's the people that are running the protocol that are doing this, it just seems... misguided and hacky at best.

I don't see the big deal with this, it even seems like a smaller deal with micro transactions. So what if it takes even an hour to confirm the transfer, are you that broke tht you need that .25c usd *right now*? I haven't paid a transaction fee since I started using bitcoin, I don't see the point. The only time I could imagine this being an issue is if you're trying topurchase say a game on steam (not that they currently accept btc) andyou wouldn't want to have to wait n hour to be able to download it (though steam allows preloading so that's a bad example actually).

From what I can understand about my filesystem (ext3) I'm lead to believe overwriting a file overwrites those same blocks on the disc. I can't confirm that though, however I've also deleted and created at least a few gigs of data since then so there's a good chance at least part of the file was overwritten even if that's not the case. I'm trying to find a simple recovery tool to use, but so far can't find anything particularly useful as I either need to know the file type, which I do, but I doubt these tools can read a berkly db file is so it won't help, or it expicitly states it cannot recover previous versions of a file.

Justifies unchecked greed with no concern for exploitation, no limits on power so long as it follows our sometimes arbitrarily structured economic system. Life isn't a game of monopoly. Actually, life is exactly a game of monopoly as the game was literally invented to present the absurdity of pure capitalism.

It's been stated the block chain can be compressed into hashes, which will have to happen at some point. This in some sense provides some pseudo anonymity for older transactions.

@_date: 2013-07-05 22:08:38
True, right now it doesn't hurt anything, but what if say 70, 80% of people start using it and sothey decide the build it into the protocol and force it on everyone if they don't upgrade? Or lets say only 10-30% use it, which in effect could lead to enough adoption to maintain it, butnot enough adoption to really give it steam and actually get anywhere. It just seems kind of empty to me in the grand scheme of things, and kind of gives me the feeling of misguidance or something, I don't know exactly, but foreshadows a bad direction for bitcoin in my mind. I just don't really see a space for this to fit in in the long run, I could be wrong though of course. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:34:21
The same could be said of any currency though. No on regulates cash, sure there are regulations, but they're impossible to enforce. Banking is regulated, credit cards are regulated, but I can give this cash to whoever I want and only them an me will know about the transfer, if you want you can even transfer it so they don't know me and I don't know them, just like you can do with btc. Also of course if you have enough money you can just pay a giant bank to launder it for you and do whatever other illegal things in the process, it's happened before and I'm sure it's still happening.

Well shit, with all this action bitcoin must be on the up, invest!
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:48:32
I don't know how else to interpret what I said.
@_date: 2013-07-30 17:42:22
You can always just say it was computer equipment, you don't have to tell them you paid for it in btc.
@_date: 2013-02-27 20:24:32
Short of controlling the internet, I don't see anything the government *can* do to shut bitcoin down or even seriously cripple it.

That's what I meant by backed in fiat, it's not viable atm.

It's been collapsing since its creation in truth, it's just been exponentially taking off ever since, lets hope we finally get to see the cards fall in our lifetime.

The tbb uses ff17...

But if they don't know where the hosting company is, and the hosting company is entirely hidden, that is to say only accessible through tor, then how could they see when data leaves the hosting company? It would look like any other tor traffic and they couldn't tell if it's originating from that computer or simply being relayed, much less anything else.

We're not, we're 'judging' it on it's ability to buy things, which for btc, especially in the comparison to WU, requires you to transfer it to something people will accept. I want it to succeed as much as everyone, but you have to approach this realistically.

Yeah, I saw that, but the only one that could kind of help is the target one, and target is out of the way for me and their groceries are expensive anyways compared to the local markets. I might have no choice though if I can't get something else soon.

Oh, did think of that, that's a novel idea. Password encrypted in my email w/a local copy seems safe and secure enough though.
@_date: 2013-02-08 05:09:53
A man in the middle attack could do it.
@_date: 2013-01-28 23:37:20
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic, but that's my point exactly.
@_date: 2013-03-01 00:16:55
I will buy 1 ounce of gold for 10$, but 10,000$, no thanks.

Really? Why's this even worrying then, you can crack anything if you have physical access to the device. If they could just implant some spyware through a backdoor over the internet I'd be a lot more worried.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:37:37
Not too worried, but just thought the community would like to know. I think btc has more than enough velocity to stand without any illegal markets at this point.
@_date: 2013-08-04 19:08:32
Why must their be a first point of contact with the 'real internet' if you're only going to .onions? You would enter through a tor proxy and it would never leave an exit node because it doesn't need to.
