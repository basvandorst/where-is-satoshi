Hehe. Well, all altcoins seems to be performing well against BTC. PPC has actually been [gaining against it](
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:48:10
Not if you are converting bitcoin to the more resilient virtual currency.

Waitstaff are paid less than minimum wage in the US. Tips are essential.

The problem is chargebacks, unfortunately.
Fortunately, that is a problem Bitcoin aims to solve!

My worry lies with people "polluting" the blockchain. Would a blockchain magnitudes larger be a threat to the system? When it gets too big for the average person to hold onto, will that contribute to centralization? Again, SatoshiDice gets a bad rep for this,  but the point of bitcoin is that people can do what they want with it. If SatoshiDice is destabilizing, then I can't imagine the protocol can handle a large transaction load with the current system.

No problem, glad I could help.

I saw someone talking about  recently, and stared using it today. Apparently updates are on the way. Be sure you change the order book scale to 100% though.

For this, we use bitcoin-days-destroyed.
[Here is a graph of it](
"Bitcoin Days Destroyed is a measure of the transaction volume of Bitcoin. If someone has 100 BTC that they received a week ago and they spend it then 700 bitcoin days have been destroyed. If they take those 100BTC and send them to several addresses and then spend them then although the total transaction volume could be arbitrarily large the number of bitcoin days destroyed is still 700." (from blockchain.info)
Does this answer any of your question?
@_date: 2013-04-10 01:04:29
Yea, it seems like all the newcomers lately are not interesting in the currency at all. Just the profit in USD. I don't know how to make some of my buddies not think like this.
"Is it too late?" "Have I missed the boat?" These questions make this seem more like a bubble than I want to admit.
EDIT: The merchants need to keep pace with the general users.

If I have a dollar, why would I spend it if I knew I could convert it to bitcoins I could sell for two dollars tomorrow?

I think the problem is that it is untested. Has an important currency ever hyperdeflated? It'll be hard to know what kind of effect deflation will have until we see it in action.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:05:56
Kind of.
Mt.Gox has a wallet for you, but it isn't extremely secure.
You can use a wallet from blockchain.info, but I would keep reading up on how to secure your Bitcoins. It is a bit complicated, but I think an online option would work, as long as you don't have a ton of value stored in your BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:39:32
Yea, when it stabilizes I think the utility can really come to the fore. I don't think there is anything that makes Bitcoin particularly more unstable than any other currency, besides how new it is right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:28:11
Well, 21 million max is a pretty small number, depending on the adoption, number lost, who holds what and how often the use it. But I think that everything that contributes to the scarcity, that doesn't make people afraid of Bitcoin, will increase the price.
But really, impossible to tell.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:56:43
BitInstant goes directly (indirectly) to your Mt.Gox account within minutes, in my experience. Some have been having issues with it lately, but I did one yesterday, and one today, and everything went peachy.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:04:51
I use BitInstant, with a moneygram payment at the grocery store. I get my funds in minutes.
However, some people have been having problems with BitInstant lately, so be chary.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:39:51
This is the kind of discussion I like. 
I don't know if Bitcoin can handle all the transactions it needs to. If people get upset at SatoshiDice? How is Bitcoin supposed to work on a large scale?
I'll add more after when I can.

That's why it is a deflationary currency, vs. an inflationary one. 
Luckily, a Bitcoin is currently a million times divisible (and the protocol could be changed to make it even more divisible.) Even if there was only one BTC left, the entire world economy could function off of the fractions of it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:57:41
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:58:43
If you didn't put in a transaction fee: this is normal.
Higher transaction fees usually mean they are confirmed faster, lower; and they might get stuck in limbo for a little while.
Just wait, it should be fine.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:07:26
They go to miners. Part of the protocol.
When there aren't sufficient coins left to be mined in order to have miners be profitable, they will depend on these fees.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:20:16
just started today, I think that would be exactly what you are looking for.
I would say, just get to know the protocol enough to have some innovative ideas, and pay people to get it done for you.
Whatever it is, please make it peer-to-peer. Please.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:49:18
I think that is just in this subreddit. I've seen a lot of people saying PPCoin will be the next big thing, and Litecoin as a good option for trading, because it is more liquid with fewer fees going from BTC:LTC. I think Mt.Gox is going to be adding LTC soon, and BTC-e does a ton of inter-crypto trading. I'd say go check that out, and see if you can make anything. I know that LTC is a better option for small miners, which can then trade for BTC. 
PPC is interesting. I can see it getting bigger. It is the most fundamentally different I think, where the system is secured by the coins themselves, rather than the miners.
Ripple is another thing people think will improve. It has some problems with centralization, but the idea is a big coin-based exchange. I think. I can't seem to find good info on it.
Ah well. Diversification is mostly always a good thing. Anyone who tells you otherwise without a second thought... should do more research.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:53:14
Thanks. I think this is a really good idea by the way. Could anyone who tries this PM me? I'd like to see how it goes. It was a problem I was grappling with today.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:14:23
Learning about it is important, but I don't think you've missed the boat. BTC has a long way to go before it lives up to its potential.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:35:40
I wouldn't say you have missed out. Bitcoin can still go up. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin, either. My first purchase was a $20 dollar bill through BitInstant, and that is worth a lot more than it was when I paid for it.
There is room to grow, just because the market looks intimidating, doesn't mean it is. Just having a little bit of money in it is more fun that just watching. When the price goes up, you can say "Heh, suck it USD," or, "I'm a little bit richer!"
I'm happy more people are getting interested in it. And not just for knowing the word Bitcoin, but for wanting to learn more about it. That is what gives Bitcoin its worth. The people who like it.
My 2 satoshis.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:16:53
With most wallets (not the "default"), you can choose whether to include a transaction fee or not. Of course, the miners would rather do the ones that include it, so they are more likely to be confirmed.
It is the free market at work, and right now, a very small amount.
Stronger miners means a more robust network, I think. And it isn't at a huge cost to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:51:10
Thanks! Tell me how it goes!
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:41:16
This is a good idea! I was just thinking about this earlier today, while playing around with mine. [They come as standard printer sized paper too]( I wonder if they'll accept bitcoins... The issue though, is with inkjet. I don't believe it ages well, and it looks like Tyvek isn't compatible with laser printers.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:57:53
But with that, couldn't you bet for *and* bet against something, and only show the one that ended up being correct?
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:51:07
I think in that case, Bitcoin is a great tool to attempt to promise benefits of both systems.
One, is government-sponsored. Benefits there are obvious, but really it goes against everything that bitcoin is about.
This doesn't make Bitcoin obsolete, in fact, I think it makes it more relevant. The benefits of digital currency is the liquidity, and is a major problem with people trying to trade BTC today. But you can use BTC:GOVERNMENTCURRENCY exchanges to promise anonymity, using a government tool. I think that it could be integrated.
Really, I think it is silly to think that BTC should exist on its own, as the sole crypto-currency. And I think it is inevitable for the government to join in with its version. I think it will have its benefits though.
Anyway, (hopefully) your government won't force you to use their digital currency. If it is better, or works well with BTC, great! If not, oh well, I'm not using it.

Google Authenticator and Google 2-step verification are the same thing. Google Authenticator is a subset of the 2-step verification, and is a smartphone app that generates a code that lets you log in. The code changes every several seconds, so that someone can't log in with just your password and username. They would need to have your smartphone as well. MtGox uses the same service. [This](  makes it seem like there is a way to change it to SMS, but I'm not sure if you can do it retroactively.
Treat your Bitcoins like money, with proper precautions, to try to avoid issues in the future. I wish you luck.
EDIT: Also, please don't blame bitcoin24. Google Authenticator is a necessity for a secure exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:45:21
The problem here though is the mix of useful, divisible currency and hyperdeflation.
Gold isn't very divisible, and hasn't been used for day-to-day transactions since... a long time.
The big difference is that, plus the ~3% annual increase vs. the 4600%+ annual increase. That is what people are concerned about. That is the uncharted part, and the part that I think people should be excited to see the results of. I don't know if it will be the "death knell," but it certainly is able to put some doubts in people's minds.
