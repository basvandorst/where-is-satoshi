The amount you are sending is below the minimum threshold. 
@_date: 2016-04-02 22:50:50
No worries! I appreciate the questions.
The high-security aspects refer mainly to invasive attacks (physically reading which bits are set).
Indeed, the chip sends the secrets on demand to the MCU. However, we use a 256-bit AES key to encrypt the secrets before sending them to the storage chip. Then, they are stored encrypted with this key plus the chip's internal memory encryption scheme. The AES key is created during factory install by padding the MCU bootloader with random bytes, which get hashed to form the key (keys are thus unique to each device). So an attacker would need to crack the AES key to extract the keys directly from the storage chip.

Printers store data in their own memory during the printing process, and this memory is not always erased. Someone could read the memory later to get your secrets.
@_date: 2016-04-02 22:22:49
The backup is a BIP32 master extended private key, which is more general than BIP39. We use the standard BIP44 keypaths for child keys. This all means it is possible to import the backup into different wallets to get at the coins.
(Note that the point of BIP39 is to provide a way to write long random numbers onto paper by hand without making copying mistakes.)
I agree that it would be better to use more rounds. However, the reason for 2048 rounds is the limited computational resources on embedded microcontrollers. In other words, many more rounds causes, in our opinion, too long of a time delay for users.

Thanks. We will put it in our feature request list and look into it.
@_date: 2017-02-16 07:26:33
For feature 1, maybe instead give a QR code on our mobile app - would that work for your use case?
@_date: 2017-02-16 09:54:43
Great. Tentatively spring/summer.
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:05:52
: )
I remember. Yea, got to wait and see ;)
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:36:25
Per point 2, just to be on the same page, the potential attack is someone else got the backup, i.e. the mnemonic sheet or the SD card. Then the question is what needs to be done in order to get the master seed: a brute force attack on the passphrase. We use the same PBKDF2 algorithm with 2048 rounds, so the security is the same. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:31:50
Backup keys are encrypted on the SD card using the device's password that you set (and key stretched following PBKDF2). 
Switching wallets is very simple, just a couple button presses from the Settings tab of the desktop app. 
There is only ever one wallet (i.e. master seed) on the hardware device at a given time, so an existing wallet seed would be overwritten.
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:02:59
oh, forgot the video link: 
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:54:57
Number 1 should read "The keys never touch your computer or the internet". Of course, making a backup (or two) and putting them somewhere safe is an important thing to do :)
Note that the keys on the SD card are encrypted. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:28:45
Maybe. To address your reply, yea, the keys need to get loaded into the MCU of course. They are loaded into RAM and immediately erased from RAM after being used. By 'kept isolated', I mean that is where they are saved. I changed the wording to 'stored isolated' in the faq to try to be more accurate. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:43:25
Thank you for the feedback.
Note that the trezor mnemonic does touch the computer during a recovery process.
In terms of parts, our device has the hardware wallet and and SD card. Trezor has the hardware wallet, a recovery sheet, and a cable. The SD card and recovery sheet should be stored somewhere safe. So what's left is one small part for us and two small parts for them.
As for the feel, it's hard to come across in just pictures. We spent some time on making it feel nice and be durable. On the other hand, making it look 'ordinary' from a distance is probably better than advertising brightly where your coins are kept.
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:10:11
Only plans for the desktop app for now.
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:24:10
In general, I prefer to let independent third parties compare the differences, and we will ship some devices to a few reviewers.
 
One note is that the ATAES132A chip is NOT used for cryptography. All cryptography is done on the MCU (including AES), is open source, and can be viewed on the Github repository. 
The RNG is in the blackbox. However, quoting our website: "We appreciate paranoia. Therefore, external entropy is added to the hardware random number generator in two ways. First, in order to remove the need to trust the hardware, some entropy is added by us through random bytes set during the factory installation. In order to remove the need to trust us, some more is automatically gathered from you when entering your device password. If that's not enough, load up your own keys either via the micro SD slot or the USB interface." (
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:13:47
The chip is an EEPROM chip with a hardware random number generator and some crypto. We just use the EEPROM for data storage and the RNG for entropy and skip the crypto (although it is used internally for encrypting stuff put on the EEPROM). High-security refers to the chip being designed to resist tampering of all sorts.
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:08:18
Note that, while not in the video, we support multisig (as a Copay client) out of the box. Better security would be if at least one of the multisig seeds is offline on a hardware wallet or other cold storage.
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:18:25
Many of the people who have had the device in their hands and played around with it have suggested setting a higher price point than trezor, and we also think that the Digital Bitbox's unique features add value. Switzerland is quite expensive, but that is not the reason :)
Note that our price includes express shipping and a free micro SD card. Trezor is $128 with express shipping ($109 standard shipping). So about the same.
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:19:25
The signing algorithm itself is less than a second. You've got to hold the touch button for 3 seconds though. Check out the video at 0:27 to see the signing process in real time.
@_date: 2017-02-15 23:43:10
and The feedback is very appreciated, and reasonable comments - thanks. We are always happy to hear what users think, good or bad.
We are newer to the market and have put our first efforts on getting the security and privacy correct, then adding what we consider important 'major' features such as Tor support and plausible deniability, and soon U2F. (4) U2F is on schedule for February delivery.
Polishing the user interface and improving convenience is next in line. For this, definitely adding a 'send all' function (5) and local currency information (3,2) is planned. 
A print QR code button (1) is a new request and makes sense. 
Alternatively, you may be interested in using a watch-only-wallet mobile app. One example on Android is [Sentinel]( With it, you can see your balance and display receiving QR codes.
It works with the Digital Bitbox. Instructions:
* Go to desktop app Options tab &gt; 'List Addresses...'
* In the new popup window, select 'Custom' and enter a 'Keypath' equal to m/44'/0'/0'
* Copy the text in the 'Xpub' box and load it into Sentinel - sorry no QR code for that at the moment.
(edit: formatting)

Features 2 to 5 for sure, can't commit yet to Feature 1 but we will look into it. 
ETA for U2F this month.
For features 2, 3, and 5, spring
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:04:55
Yes, backups on the SDCard can be encrypted with an arbitrarily complex passphrase (its key stretched and salted too).
I agree with your first point about seed storage. A difference is seed *recovery* with an SD card is also offline. Other wallets require entering the seed through the computer -- most do it well, but the seed *is* touching a potentially compromised device.
But the main advantages of the SD card is convenience and it is really easy/fast to switch between different wallets. As an example for the latter, maybe one wallet (backed up on one SD card) is for long term storage of savings, while another wallet (backed up on a different SD card) has a smaller amount of coins for routine use.
@_date: 2016-03-25 17:49:00
This is indeed an important question. 
We solve the issue with a mobile app that allows you to use your phone as a large screen. This serves as user verification, and the phone can also be enabled to be a two-factor authentication device (2FA). The mobile app gets securely paired with the Digital Bitbox and communicates using encrypted messages. Technically, the encryption key is made using a hashed Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) key exchange in combination with off-channel information from a blink code - i.e. the device's LED blinks a few times and you enter this in the mobile app, avoiding man-in-the-middle attacks on a fully compromised computer.
More details and screen shots are here: 
One nice benefit of using a mobile app is there is lots of room to display information, which gives space to show all transaction details (i.e. change address, input values, fees, etc.).
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:14:23
Except many of the dark clusters are in the middle of nowhere.
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:15:41
Not yet. This is next on the agenda.
@_date: 2015-04-18 09:48:33
You are changing topics.
EAL certification targets algorithms and/or operating systems running on hardware, not the physical hardware chip by itself.
You also seem to be contradicting yourself. For example, one crucial algorithm in the Digital Bitbox code is the ECDSA library. It is open source code, which of course has not been through the time-consuming and costly certification process - about [1 year and a quarter million dollars]( Yet, interestingly, you [like the ideas]( 
Again, the issue comes down to open-source vs closed-source, with patented closed-source products having the financial incentive to gain certification. Will your [planned open source crypto library]( implementation be EAL4+ certified?
I appreciate your other post about fault injection: specific, helpful, although hardly fatal, and addressable. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:09:41
Just to be clear, the main issue with Atmel is being US-based and susceptible to NSA? I didn't find similar alternatives  to the ATAES chip last time I looked, but will check around again.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:17:19
Got it. The navigation font has been changed. (Logo still the same.)
Edit: Will look into the other font suggestions this weekend. Thanks. Had to change the nav font quickly due to the outrage!
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:41:17
Yes. The results need to be converted into a BIP39 compatible 24-word mnemonic. This can then be imported via either the micro SD slot or USB communication.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:32:47
Thanks for the kind words.
Note that the 'device: lock' command, which enables full 2FA, basically does your last idea. The micro SD / backup / seeding is disabled. The TRNG/PRGN is still available, but only for spitting out random numbers to a PC. The device needs to be fully erased in order to become 'unlocked'.
Edit: The device passwords / keys are all erased. The firmware remains.
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:42:02
Indeed, it is hard (impossible?) to remove all trust. I haven't found a way around having to trust the hardware designer, i.e. me. I would be interested in hearing ideas to do so. I think a hardware wallet combined with multisig is a promising path.
Just to comment on entropy for those reading in passing. A user can generate their own BIP39 mnemonic seed and create a wallet with it, not relying on the onboard random number generator. The random numbers themselves can be read out in order to verify their integrity - follows NIST 800-90 SP specification according to the [datasheet](
@_date: 2015-04-16 19:55:56
Firmware updates have advantages. Not using firmware updates, in my opinion, is not ignoring a problem but creating a new problem. Reducing secure code to its essential parts, getting it right, and then taking away the ability to make changes requires thorough attention. I hope this announcement will get more eyes to look at the code.
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:58:26
The link discusses the 'CryptoMemory' family of products, but the Digital Bitbox uses a part from the 'CryptoAuthentication' family of products, which have additional physical security features. 
The part in question (edit: on the Digital Bitbox) is also only used for storing secrets and generating random numbers. Just in case someone tries to read the secrets from the secure chip as in the link, I additionally encrypt the secrets on the main MCU before sending them to the secure chip.
As for reputation, not the same devices, but the same link says the AT90xxxUSB is the 'most secure of the available OTS choices'. The same author is [quoted]( on the SAM7XC crypto co-processor "In summary, this is a very well secured device ... Nice job Atmel!". (For those reading the link, RAM holding secrets is zeroed after use in the Digital Bitbox.) I did not find published attacks on the CryptoAuthentication family of products.
Nevertheless, a main lesson is that given enough time and money, any hardware can be hacked. Our goal should be to make it time consuming, invasive, and expensive to accomplish.
Sidenote: "ATAES132 has fixed cryptographic functionality; it is not a microcontroller and cannot accept customer firmware."
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:14:38
Anyone else have opinions on the font?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:13:33
Targeting mid-May to begin accepting orders. 
A price hasn't been set yet, but it will be in the upper two-digit range.
@_date: 2015-04-17 08:20:36
Thanks. No worries. I appreciate the feedback.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:47:46
Thanks for the advice. I will think of strategies for dev kits and soliciting audits.
Note that the MCU code on GitHub will compile on PCs with a 'make' command. Device specific functions such as touch button, LED, sd card, and other low level drivers are not available of course, but the signing / wallet / crypto code is fully accessible using the same JSON API.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:03:07
Thanks. Yes. BIP39 compatible mnemonic seeds can be imported through the micro SD slot or by a USB command. 
Note that the device can be erased and new seeds generated or imported, for example if one would like to resell a device. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:52:49
I have seen the presentation. Thank you for publishing it. 
I assume you are implying that it is better to use smartcard approaches for new designs? Smartcards were not chosen here as their algorithms are closed-source due to layers of patents. Therefore any smartcard approach requires trust. The Digital Bitbox uses open source code and it has been designed to avoid the attack vectors listed in the presentation, as explained in detail [here]( 
Firmware updates present another attack vector, but one that is avoidable.
Signing invalid or modified data is avoided here by the user verification provided by the smartphone app, as explained [here](
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:21:54
Happy to :)
2nd week in May or after is good.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:03:33
Makes sense. Competing aside, I respect the work you've done and wish you luck.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:47:50
Smartphone apps are sandboxed and relatively secure. However, anything can be hacked, and I need to draw a line at some point. If the computer that generates a signature and the 2FA smartphone app are both fully compromised/rooted with application-specific man-in-the-middle malware (simple keylogging isn't enough), then funds are susceptible.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:50:35
2FA. See [here]( and let me know if it is not clear.
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:40:13
I agree again. This is a problem for any hardware wallet, and it is important for the public to be aware. 
I do believe multisig can solve the problem of a single hardware wallet being able to steal funds, although this has not been implemented yet.
