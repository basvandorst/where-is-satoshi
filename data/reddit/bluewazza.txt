Hey hey heeeey
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:25:30
Thanks. That should have been obvious but I figured I'd check. I am guilty of not using a hot wallet that supports segwit. Any recommendations?

If you're young and have no dependents, debt or other financial commitments then maybe. Otherwise definitely not.

Pffft... Do they even lift?

Does it matter if your cold storage is non-segwit?

This bums me out. It's great that we're all getting richer on paper, but the hysteria over price gains takes the focus off what btc really is. That future gets put at risk if the holder base is full of people simply trying to get rich quick. Then again, if that future is possible, then btc should be able to survive a speculative rotation in and out.
Here's to everyone getting even richer, but hopefully with a few less "game over, we won" memes. It's gonna be a long slog.

Why down vote this? It's right. buying on coinbase with a linked bank account takes about a week before you actually have the btc in your account.

aaaaand the magic is gone.

I bought my first in 2013. Biggest mistakes were (1) storing on an exchange and (2) selling any coins ever. Taking your basis out is never a bad idea. But my strategy going forward is simple. HODL!

Amen... It's Christmas. Even if you don't celebrate Christmas, it's not the worst idea to take a weekend away from your screen and clear your mind. Remind yourself that there are a lot of other things that matter, some of which you might have been neglecting during this crazy past few months. Peace (of mind) to all.

OR... sell everything as soon as it trades off a few thousand bucks, because clearly that well be the end of the bit coins. Forever this time.

Yes and no. If there is an imbalance of institutional money that wants to be short BTC IN the futures market, then the price of BTC for cash settlement at some future date could be below where actual BTC is trading. Since there is no way (that I'm aware of) for brokers to short actual Bitcoin, the way it would drag on price would be by removing demand from the "physical" BTC markets. Meaning, someone who wants to be long BTC who can buy futures (or an ETF based on those futures) will have a cheaper way to express that view and thus not buy "physical".
I, for one, can't see myself buying anything but actual BTC. One almost certain impact IMO will be that volatility should decline after whatever initial price movement occurs.
