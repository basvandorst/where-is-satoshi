Lots of people got in to get the free air drop of b2x. Since it's probably not happening, lots of people are dumping BTC into alts, trying to catch a positive wave up

Well if you have decimals, then you may might not receive your forked funds. At least that's how it was with the BCH fork. Lots of people with amounts smaller than 1 whole btc didn't get their BCH. That's probably more because of the exchanges and not because of the fork. You will technically have an equal amount of S2X as BTC. It's only a matter of being able to transfer/access it.
Holding on is of your own volition. I can't give you advice on selling because it may go up or down, and I don't want any part in having you lose money.

Why don't you think about it? 
They can't. Bitcoin will only be finished mining in 2100. 
Purchasing vast amounts of Bitcoin will significantly drive up the price and cost of each one they buy. At this moment the market cap is $70billion, so to buy "all" of today's Bitcoin, it would cost them a minimum $70billion, and even still miners would be getting Bitcoin for each transaction made; meaning the banks would have to continuously purchase more till 2100.
Bitcoin is inherently designed to deflationary. There's still 4 million Bitcoins to mine, and if the banks buy up all of the current supply of bitcoin, then the 4 million Bitcoin left will be worth exponentially more because of scarcity and difficulty to mine.
All transactions are visible, the community will know who's purchasing Bitcoin, just like how they saw JP Morgan Chase was buying up Bitcoin after Jamie Dimon called it a fraud. There are and will be people who will never sell Bitcoin, especially for this reason. The value of their holdings will skyrocket, proving Bitcoin to be a success.
If the banks don't go under from trying to buy all of the Bitcoin, there's no way they would turn down an opportunity to sell the Bitcoin they acquired to make a profit. It's a lose-lose situation for the banks.

You're not going to get both coins from coinbase, so if you're gonna buy BTC, don't leave it on coinbase. Nowhere in that post does he say that coinbase is going to give you both. It's the same garbage they said during the Bitcoin Cash fork. They still haven't given anyone their Bitcoin Cash.

Coinbase is the easiest way to get Bitcoin and Litecoin in the US. Only problem with them is that their fees are ridiculously high at 4% or something. You can pay via wire, but it takes over a week to receive your purchase. Or you can pay with credit and instantly receive your purchase, but with higher fees.

Yeah probably, but I think with the overwhelming support for core, it may not dip at the fork. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:09:19
If coinbase decides that the S2X version is better, then maybe. There's always a chance. I'm just saying that for people who were supportive of BCH, they got screwed by coinbase, because coinbase didn't support BCH. If coinbase decides that BTC2X (or whatever the S2X version is going to be called) is better than BTC, then you can say bye to your BTC.
And if you're holding on then you aren't buying at dip, right? 
I'm personally avoiding all of this fork bullshit after the last one. I'm gonna miss out on some extra free S2X or whatever, but I'm banking on a strong rebound for altcoins and major developments overall. There's also supposed to be a Bitcoin gold fork this month, but I haven't really heard anything about it, so it's probably DoA.

No... because if you sell your BTC before the fork, you will have to pay get S2X. If you already have BTC and I mean whole amounts of BTC, not 0.0037376 BTC, then you'll have both. For every whole BTC that you have, you'll get 1 S2X.
