Bitcoins only real value is in anonymous transactions, otherwise it's a fucking bank ponzi pump and dump. 
Want some coins?, sure just send your photo ID, utility bill, banking information and a fresh DNA sample to your favorite exchange so you can be approved to trade your fiat for crypto.

a bunch of people just got rich, how is it not working? , if you ask me it looks like its working too well. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:14:54
why?. I thought drugs and drug dealers were all evil. A whole lot of "bad" people just lost money, is that not what the system wants?. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:16:11
it would make more sense that the government would see this as a positive thing because it's drug dealers losing money which makes me suspicious about a lot of things.
