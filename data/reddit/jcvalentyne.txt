You can't have a blockchain without a coin to incentivize the network.
And it's clear you're 100% btc and closed off to alts because you're spreading lies and are not informed well. Vitalik did not sell ALL his eth, and ofcourse he sold some? Devs need to pay for all sorts of costs, just like any other coin. I would suggest opening up to some alts because I can assure you Bitcoin will certainly not be the only winner in this space at all..

Whether there is any truth to whales manipulating, the fact people think it does keeps buyers off until the 26th when they expire.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:45:39
You understand some huge firms are building on Ethereum already? They're on the private chains for now as Ethereum needs to be able to scale more, and as Vitalik claims 2018, the year of scalability. 
We'll see if what he says is true, if he can get us the minimum working product of Plasma it's game over.

i dont disagree a lot are scams, just stick to the top 25 excuse a few obvious shit ones like EOS, DASH etc..
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:37:55
I think like me, people are putting a lot more than they can afford to lose haha

Novogratz said consolidation between $10 and $16k and if sitation got extreme, to $8k. Considering the market is very bullish, tons of new people every day according to exchanges like coinbase and bitstamp noting figures like 100k new accounts every day and unconfirmed tx going down (100k less unconf tx than yesterday), I don't think we're seeing $10k again
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:02:43
this wall at $19k is nothing compared to what we've taken down before
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:00
Why is everyone saying we going lower, very well could do but unlikely imo, last wave is the hardest like on September 15th during the Chinda fud, the day prices crashed the hardest is where they rebounded and reversed the trend into a bull market, I think this was the last wave, I mean we broke into the fucking $12,000’s
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:01:55
theres this exact fucking dip every mid day. and we recover everytime, honestly anyone selling at this price deserves to get burned
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:21:53
move your BTC to a new BTC wallet.
export your private keys and use them on a bcash wallet and send the bcash to an exchange and buy more BTC with the free bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:37
theyre ahead of schedule so maybe like 10 days
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:55:08
Agreed. Last wave is the hardest, anyone remember that bear run during the China fud? September the 15th, prices dipped the hardest and instantly rebounded leading into a bull market for the next 2 months, sounds like what’s happening here
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:48
are futures the 10th or the 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:22:50
It already touched into the 12’s
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:07:52
LET THE MEME GAMES COMMENCE
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:30
my nigga no, youre buying high selling low? you know this shit recovers overnight and dips midday? been happening all week
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:41:41
yeah it's called bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:33:59
100k less unconf tx than yesterday. I know there is a problem but I swear there are FUD attacks because unconfirmed tx flash up to a high number for a single day and then dwindle down to the regular amount..
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:25:54
It will correct further, it's run from $7k to $20k..
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:45:39
you saw the drop earlier bounce, you saw the people who sold got burned, do what you gotta do
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:40:47
I think we're staying above $10k
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:48
binance or bittrex
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:10:21
LOL shorters = ded

Guys dont fuck this up. Set up heavy meme support or we're going down.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:17
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:34:07
Alright thanks, if its not certain there is a hardfork, why the speculation over it and repeated articles suggesting it?
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:07:21
if they were early, they sorta are mate.. you're just the sheep looking for gains.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:06:52
Erm why do you say major correction then probably 400-500 dollars?
Lmfao that’s not a correction, a major correction would be back down to 6k. 400-500 is literally nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:29
agreed, wasnt there a rumour that bithumb is listing btc tho?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:45:03
Why so? With such gains, i'm willing to bet most people here have more money in crypto than traditional investments.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:55:37
Crypto is fucking sad and this shit will pop if shit like this remains. The devs had bounties for other people to build the main net and test net because the devs in their team weren't competent enough to do it them selves. Infact, the devs even injected their own code to send 0.5% of fees in tx to their personal wallet.
So how is a coin where their devs couldn't even build their own main net or test net and are proven scammers, now 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:00:42
My first crash was during the China FUD. I watched tens of thousands disappear over the course of an entire month, constantly dropping. Since then, I have legit become emotionless, I could lose 70% of my port and I feel nothing. Watching all the new comers in this mini correction is funny.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:47:55
You fuckers.. I saw this ad years and years ago but didn’t click cause it looked like a kid subreddit due to the drawing. The cheap $200 BTC...
@_date: 2018-11-02 00:17:53
you know... hes-up right? He bought back in the $3-4k range in 2017 summer..
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:18:06
Is LN out or not? I keep hearing that transfers and payments are being made with LN and there are over 1000 nodes...?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:48:32
how you doing in this crash? im down 70% as I said xd
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:35:27
Ah I see, but it looks like the 2 sticky posts can be merged together as they are very similar? Introduction to new comers and phishing link warnings.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:45:58
nigga this comment is 2 months old
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:33:44
The last big correction we bottomed and instantly reversed, the September correction, we hit a flash crash to a new low @ $3k and reversed.
I feel like the flash crash to $7.5k was the bottom, it definitely was a convincing bottom
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:09:06
Fees should be like $1 (at least for me)

I know a seed is used for back up. But I wanted to make sure if maybe you needed the copy of the wallet file as well. I have a lot in the wallet so I don't want to risk it as I assume things, just wanted to be absolutely sure.
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:45:06
I don’t think traditional economic studies is going to help in crypto... And this is not a bubble, an entirely new asset class that is revolutionary and its worth 1/8 of a singular companies market cap..
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:53:19
Okay, great, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:12:06
Yeah you’re a butthurt banker dickrider 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:18:05
why does everyone complain about btc fees.. am I the only person sending BTC with &lt;$1 fees for the past month
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:56:46
The amount of people calling this a bubble... fuckin being calling this a bubble since $30. Either get in or step back on the bankers dick.
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:14:20
Of course, but a bubble as big the .com was of course going to crash, value behind those investments in companies were worthless.. bitcoin is not useless, ICO’s are cash grabs and will crash, but not worthy crypto like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:10:22
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:22:45
We're calling them 5% drops now?
