You don't pay capital gain on currency just like i wouldn't need to report a gain/loss between the dollar and euro. If you run a forex type business then yes, you would need to show capital gains/losses but if your spending on goods/services capital gains don't apply.

Well yes, with proper regulation it would of stopped Mtgox from using depositor fiat from being loaned out to other people. It could of also ensured that the cold storage funds were properly secured/maintained and possibly having the hot wallets insured for theft. It could of prevented the trading of goxcoins in the last few days and give people affected better legal recourse in the aftermath. 
My favourite point is it would of held Mark liable and accountable for his incompetence/thievery.

You also seem to have some misguided hatred against your government. It's ok though, you've been brainwashed for a long time by the media and possibly your social circle (republican im assuming?)  so let me enlighten you. 
The term "small government" is just a code word for less regulation. This is bad for you, unless your really rich or a corporation.

This is my favorite example to shove in your face about "big" vs "small" government. I could keep going further with Citizen united, Buckley v. Valeo, and recent McCutcheon v.

Ok i really don't know how to explain this any more clearer then i already am. You seem to be some sort of law student that's still wet behind the ears.Please for the love of god understand that just because you learnt what bailment law is law week, doesnt mean it applies here. **CASH IS NOT A BAILMENT.**


I don't recognize this because its wrong. I give you cash, THAT IS NOT A BAILMENT!cash is not ever included in a bailment because its not chattel! You don't seem to understand this simple fact. 


This is Illegal. Banks and only banks can use depositor money as assets because they are insured and licensed to do so. A random LLC cannot do this no matter what they write in their TOS, It is illegal in the financial world in 99% of counties!!! MTgox is not a bank, they cant act like one just because their TOS says so.


No bankers were arrested for the 2008 crash does this mean that there was no crimes committed? If MTgox was located in North America he would be charged, why do you think hes refusing to come to the FinCEN hearing?he knows what he did was illegal and would be arrested and charged if he shows up. I'm speculating that Japanese authorities simply don't give a shit because majority of people defrauded are not citizens so why dump all the money and effort to prosecute when the company broke and they would never recoup the losses/cost.

That would be considered more of an accounting ledger not a virtual currency.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:05:41
Well, i'm not a lawyer and i know even less about Japanese law but this is coming from an accounting perspective which is fairly universal(GAAP). You seem to be applying american law to this situation which is strange but here we go.


I don't understand how this part is relevant, why does it need to be the same 100$? Most if not all transactions to Mtgox were wire transfers so this part makes no sense. 


Cash is not chattel and MTgox was not directly selling bitcoins.
Mtgox was in the business of facilitating the exchange of currency for bitcoins, similar to a broker. They did not own the bitcoins they were selling simply providing a service to connect two parties and take a percentage cut. 
In accounting they would need to show all the cash the company could spend as a revenue first. So if i deposit 100$ they would need to increase the revenue account and the cash account. The problem is that 100$ is not revenue because it is not earned from the standard business operation from Mtgox. Basically, they would need to show they provided 100$ worth of service to the client before recognizing that 100$ as a revenue the company could spend. 
That 100$ was not revenue because their business model was only taking a % of depositor money for facilitating the transaction. If Mtgox was taking the 100$ and selling you 100$ worth of bitcoin they owned then that would be different. So by Mtgox having this business model its implied that they are holding your money (minus their fees)
 in trust from an accounting standpoint because they can only recognise their transaction fee as revenue and nothing else because no other service has been provided.

Again, im not a lawyer so im going to need a source on this. The financial world just recently started adopting a standard method for reporting finances, and even some huge counties haven't fully switched over yet. I have very little faith that they are all on any universal ownership law at this point. 


Again, **Cash is not bailment because its not chattel**. 


No, cash is always cash. The only time cash can be ever considered bailment is if its a trust fund or tied to some other financial instrument. Gold, bitcoin, car, lending a cd to a friend are all bailments, cash is not. We cant argue this point further if you don't recognize this.


Mtgox doesnt need to be regulated as a broker or exchange for the principal im talking about to apply, this is standard for any corporation. For example, you prepay me 100$ for accounting services. I do work and bill you 60$ for it, the left over 40$ is your money and i can't use it for my business unless i perform another service and bill you 40$ for it. If you decide not to hire me for more work i must return your 40$ because i can't report as revenue as its unearned and a prepaid account a.k.a. liability to me. This applies to any business and is a standard rule in accounting you can't have a TOS to negate this principle.


Not lawyer so im not going to speculate the legality or whatever regarding Japanese law. I am very confident is saying that if Mtgox is unable to return the cash from the users accounts recorded at the day of closer, there has been fraud or negligence which is kinda obvious and beating a dead horse.

Plenty of people didn't store Bitcoins on Mtgox but they still lost the coins /fiat while trying to do daily trades. Now because of no regulation, they have no legal method to recover their losses. 
What's to stop another exchange from building a reputation for a few months, waiting for a day with higher then average trading  and just making a bank run with the coins? 
People need to learn that regulation isn't a dirty word, especially when its aimed at controlling immoral people/corporations from screwing consumers. I feel that scamming from unregulated exchanges will be more detrimental to growth and adoption then a slight increase in costs to these exchanges for complying with regulations.

Your comment means nothing and really irrelevant to what im saying. I not saying regulate/centralize bitcoin, im saying regulate the exchanges that accept bitcoin for fiat because you to accept fiat there needs to be a centralized entity to do so. 
If its a coin to coin exchanges, there's really no need for regulation because i can transfer my coins as soon as the trades complete. If you involve fiat in the trade i need to wait for that money to be deposited to my account, which opens up oodles of time for an unregulated exchange to do whatever they wish.

Individuals can choose which government they belong to, we call it immigration(you're not being forced at birth, we just haven't figured out how to ask newborns what government they want to belong to so we just give them their parents). 
im curious, how does this non geographical government work? So if i belong to government Blue and my neighbour belongs to government Red, which government is responsible for healthcare, taxes, trash, police, communications, ect..? If my neighbour comes on my property, could i shoot him for invading my country?  If i call the Blue police, do they need to go through a Red border check point while passing my neighbours house? 
I skimmed the article, what's the relevancy to this discussion? From what i understood there just trying to change bitcoins protocol into "ETHEREUM"?

You're not wrong but at the same time the way you're wording everything is wrong and you seem slightly misinformed about a few things.
You're right about Assets and liabilities changing and that's called double entry accounting. If i deposit 100$ to mtgox their cash would go up 100$ and liabilities would also increase by the same amount. The difference is that they would need to have a special cash account in their assets called "cash in trust" or something similar thats different from their businesses "cash" account. The only reason "cash in trust" is called an asset is because the only other way to record this transaction is some sort of contra liability account with a debit balance. That account would look really dumb in accounting so they just stick it under an asset to make it easier, in no way is "cash in trust" an asset of the company thought. 
So if i deposit 100$ (with 1% transaction fee) this is how the accounts would look:
Account |   |   |   | Debt | Credit
Cash(Asset) |   |   |   | 1 | 
Cash in trust(Asset) |   |   |   | 99 | 
Depositor payable(Liability) |   |   |   |  | 99
Revenue(S/H Equity) |   |   |   |  | 1
 
Mtgox would not be able to use depositor money for their daily operations because it should of been held in trust similarly how a lawyer or real estate agent holds your money in trust during a transaction. They would be allowed to use their "cash" account that they get from transaction fees for facilitating these transactions for their day to day operations. 
Banks are allowed to use depositor money for investments because they are insured for X$ amount and have the proper licences for it. I don't think Mtgox had the same designations as a bank so they would not be allowed to use depositor money in the same manner.
