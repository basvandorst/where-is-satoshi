It is this class (from your second link): 
It tries to retrieve random from  which is very bad decision for multiple reasons. One is that it uses http, not https. So somebody could easily inject in middle and provide bad random data. Or what if there is no network connection? Then no random.

And the code they replaced with is also pretty bad. It generates only 128-bit of entropy for random seed. While real Bitcoin private key can be 256-bit long, you get only subset of them with their app (still a lot, but not as many as possible).

That's not accurate. SHA-384 is similar to SHA-512. They both are pretty much the same thing. SHA-384 is simply truncated version of SHA-512 - it simply cuts off some byes from SHA-512.
It's SHA-224 that is similar to SHA-256 (also by cutting off some output bytes).

Sorry I mistyped. How do you use public key to decrypt message using ECDSA? You don't know message, you don't know randomly generated private key (k), you know only (r,s) values and public key dG. How do you get out message?
I know how ECDSA can sign and verify message and how that can be used to transfer BTC. But you said ECDSA can be used for encryption. I can imagine ECDSA signing being as encryption. But for decryption??? How do you do that? I know how ECDH can be used for encryption (by generating common symmetric key), or ElGamal with elliptic curves. But ECDSA never does encryption. Only signing/verify.

If it is encyption the how do you decrypt message fron signature (r,s) and private key d?

Yes, it is capable. Look up ElGamal with elliptic curves.

 (example 4.1)
The trickiest step is first one - to map message to point on elliptic curve. Typically you prepend small amount of bits (32) with any value to message and increment this number by one until you get number which is valid as x coordinate on curve. Then recepient needs to discard first 32 bits once he decrypts the point. This means that for example 256-bit curve can encrypt only 224 bit value.
This ElGamal ECC encryption is used for example in PlayReady DRM from Microsoft.
There are some other schemes to do the encryption using ECC. Like Menezes-Vanstone Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem:  (page 31..35)
