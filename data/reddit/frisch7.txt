The end of bitcoin? I’d be more worried about it being the end of everything. If someone has that much computing power, and current encryption methods stay the same, bitcoin is going to be on the bottom of their list of things to break into...

are you expecting the price to go up every single day without any type of pullback or correction?

I believe Gemini supports it, electrum is a software wallet and is okay for storing your bitcoin. GDAX is coinbases trading platform

Why are you worried? 
Why did you buy bitcoin? 
Did you buy it because you understand the technology and look forward to it’s future or did you buy it because you wanted to get rich quick?

It's hard to say because what might seem like a insignificant amount of bitcoin now might be worth a small fortune in the future (or nothing). While it's more secure to have a hardware wallet it's up to you to decide what works best for you.

How so? Bitcoin is designed to be peer to peer. You only lose anonymity if you use a public exchange to cash out or buy in. You can still remain anonymous by doing exchanges privately between individuals or Bitcoin ATMs. You are trading convenience for privacy when you use an exchange like coinbase. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, it's just the way it is.

They miners are, in a way, trading electricity for bitcoins. They have to sell the bitcoins to pay their electric bills.

It is also up over $2k this month. Zoom out on the chart and chill out.

I’ll let you know if/after it hits 10k

Can't banks just steal people's money?
