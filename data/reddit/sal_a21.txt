Thank you sir

Yes sir all I’m thinking about is regrets now  but hopefully i will  manage to get the degree I’ll find a good job and get more btc. the hard part is when i spend the amount i have now while studying then probably I’ll come to my life where i  sleep on the streets again :) but it’s true when they say no pain no gain. I’m ready to take the challenge and study for a better future.

Yes there’s scams, but this is my story and I’m proud of it, and i will not get a single satoshi as a donation or whatever it’s called.
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:21:05
Many people have said this, i will not accept a single satoshi from anyone I just wanted to tell my story, Believe it or not it’s up to you sir.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:19:47

Thanks, Poland I think it’s a good choice
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:49:55
I did some calculations, and here is it, i had 0.91 which i sold for $9880 in poland in average you need $450-$500 a month 450 *12=5400 plus $1500 tuition fees for one year = approximately $6900 and I’m left with about $3000 and I’ll do my best to find a job, I might fail all this but I’ll take the risk. Yes i was minimalistic for 2 years and i hope that all that hardship turn into success, Thanks for your understanding.

I have my main account which I’m active and have my personal information on it, i did this to for privacy reasons and I’m not asking for anything in return it’s just a short story I wanted to share that’s it.

@_date: 2019-07-07 18:49:50
That’s right, some people like to keep their privacy that’s it and i Just wanted to share it with people, the purpose wasn’t to get donations.

I’m not getting a single satoshi from this I just wanted to share it,
@_date: 2019-07-06 23:01:28
Thank you sir but I just wanted to share my story this post is not for donations or anything that is related to giving money. Yes it’s a very good feeling when money come from somewhere but I have enough for a while and I’m not looking to ask people for money.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:09:07
I have never asked for money in my entire life, a cheap person like you talking shit here is worthless, I haven’t mentioned anything that will tell people give me money and I didn’t talked about it until this guy brought it up so keep your mouth shut.

Thank you for sharing your thoughts, nothing is predictable I might join the military and still be the same and I might go and study and still end up on the streets so i will take the risk and try to study yes bitcoin supply is limited but still i have a great chance starting to buy again after I graduate.

Thank you ����
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:06:44
Thank u sir
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:38:42
I’ve never begged anyone to give me money, I slept on streets and still didn’t, but if someone wants to help then I’m happy with it and I would appreciate the help
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:24:13
Everything i said is what I’ve been doing for last 2 years for a better future, as I said this on other comments, i will not accept any donation no matter how big or how small the amount is, it’s just a story I wanted to share,
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:29:16
Thank you sir
@_date: 2019-07-07 11:12:51

Thanks man
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:26:24
Thank you sir it’s valuable to me but now i need to do this, hopefully I’ll be able to do it all over again.
@_date: 2019-07-06 22:11:24
I’m happy whenever i see someone who got out of  the streets, the bad thing is people are calling it a lie i only shared the story without asking for donations or anything that will make money for me, I just wanted to get it off of my chest and share it somewhere. Thank u for sharing your story,  hopefully everything I’ve suffered from will turn into success one day.
