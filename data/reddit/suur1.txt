That is just as trustworthy as when the commisars say the take the needs of the workers for shoes, cars and telephones into account when they determine the price of these goods. Even if they had the best of intentions they have no change of knowing what each individual prefers, and we don't even know their intentions. I guess you just trust them. That's your choice. I would prefer to opt out of that if you don't mind.

The problem with the setting of the interest rate by issuing bonds and printing money is the same as in a communistic economy with setting the prices of everything: The preferences of the actual participants in the trade of goods are ignored. 
Interest rate is just the price for deferred consumtion traded against entrepreneurial opportunity and nobody knows what that price should be excect those who actually do defer their consumption or actually have that entrepreneurial opportunity. 
When the communistic state steps in and decides the price of goods, it is ignoring the preferances of the participants in the trade and basically treating them as just another factor of prodution. The worker need this amount food and clothes in order to dig this amount of coals from the ground. There is a special name for people who are treated as factors of production.
Simillarly when a central bank and the government step in and fix the intererst rate by printing money and issuing bonds (backed by future taxes) they are ignoring the preferences of the parties involved, the saver and the entrepreneur. The result is the chaos we are witnessing.

How do you know where they get these things from? Do they publish their rationale? I don't know, but I think not. Enlighten me.

Ideal for whom? Aren't these private actors? Why shoul they have in anyones interest in mind but their own? Is their kindness a given?

They may have flowery explantions for their decisions but since they are ignoring the the preferences of the actual participants in the interchange, the saver and the borrower, their decisions are just as arbitrary as those of the communists.
