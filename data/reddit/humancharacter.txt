Okay, it worked! 
Thanks so much

I’m trying to purchase bitcoin from USD.
I’ll try your suggestion
Edit: how do you use USD wallet as the payment source?
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:27:15
You didn’t specify the shitcoins, but I’m just going to assume anything that’s not in the top 100.
Even though my holdings are in the top ten.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:59:39
I mean you can with my paper ledger wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:23:52
Question. I have everything set up via Coinbase and bout $100 worth of bitcoin.
It says transaction is pending and I also got an email saying that a payout will be next Tuesday. What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:34:34
So what do you suggest? I don’t know where to put it... a wallet?
Can I do this while the transaction is still pending?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:51:41
Mine just kicked in 2 hours ago. So about a week
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:13:23
Oh that makes much more sense...
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:39:10
Sooo how does this work for a student?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:25
I mean I am...bought it Tuesday 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:52:12
About a week
Mine just came in from last Tuesday
But it’s different for everyone 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:54:52
College student here
My answer: Yes
I convinced myself with price equivalence.
Example: Why should I buy this soda if it instead can go into bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:57:23
Mine said it will take till Next Tuesday (Dec 12)
I bought Tuesday this week.
Everyone else is saying that this is semi normal 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:18:46
I don’t see too good faith for BitCoin specifically, but I do see a future for crypto currency in general.
Go for crypto currency, but don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
Take me for a grain of salt as I am new to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:21:56
It’s exactly what you think it is...
Avoid phony wallet apps
Know where you do your exchanges
Continuously monitor your transactions
Etc. 
No real “new” info
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:54:48
But you need gold to make components for the GPU miners...
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:12:34
Okay, let’s say I want a software wallet for now... specifically iOS
Any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:48:52
I would suggest to spread it a bit. Don’t put your eggs all in one basket.
I have some in altcoins, but I have more in bitcoin.
$3k is a lot in my book, but it’s your call.
I would suggest that when you surpass your principal, take that out so that you only have what you gained one the table. Someone told me this advice
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:20:33
Wait... we are supposed to provide ID? 
Is that why my transaction is taking forever?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:29
The price hit 19k and took a dump to 16k, then re-stabilized at 17k?
What causes that?
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:19:10
Should’ve gotten something else. Bentley’s are okay, but not better than a Rolls Royce in my experience.
Did a lot of chauffeured drives for a luxury car rental company in Charlotte a few years back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:52
I’ve been waiting since Tuesday... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:36:50
It took me 50 seconds, but I did it two days ago
Go check your email
Yes, I actually timed it... it was roughly 50 seconds 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:35:25
My question is how far does this go back? 
My HP laptop is 2014
@_date: 2018-09-18 12:53:18
Open shortcuts app
Create Shortcuts &gt; on the top right you will see a dual toggle symbol that will take you to settings &gt; icon &gt; glyph &gt; then just scroll around to currency.
I’d recommend you take the time to figure out how to use shortcuts, it’s really cool to use.

Someone bought a Lamborghini for 45 Bitcoin
Edit: just realized it’s decentralized TV

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:17:51
Noted: Thanks for the advice 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:23
Completely honest... I have no idea what that means. 
Can you dumb it down?
@_date: 2018-09-18 05:28:57
There’s this app that works with iOS 12 called Shortcuts. Think of this app like apple’s response to Google Home’s Shortcuts.
You can customize logos, this is an option...
Shortcuts by Apple

Geez dude, just set up an account on coinbase
You’ll need:
•active email address
•Source of funds (credit/debit/bank account)
•US issues identification (Coinbase is mostly US)
•some money to invest in.
You can literally do all this on your phone
-I’m just as new as you are... just bought last Tuesday
Everyone is saying sidebar... I’m on my phone
Once you’re familiar with Coinbase, get familiar with GDax
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:57:32
I always thought of HODL to mean something like an acronym,  never thought that is was originated as a typo...
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:37:48
Kinda awkward since actual Jordan Belfort is against Bitcoin and Crypto Currency in general. I wonder if his thoughts changed since February.
@_date: 2018-08-13 03:58:16
How did I not see that. I was there last week...
Be sure to check out the museum of natural history... long line, but totally worth it.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:07:35
True... he is a big fan of blockchain technology.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:08:13
Yes Apple will likely have a response to Samsung’s Crypto Wallet’s, but it’s obvious that they’re going to tread carefully adding BTC.
All it’s really going to be is an added feature to Apple Pay/Wallet App while reintroducing a next generation “secure-element”.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:10:27
There’s no such thing...
It’s just ApplyPayCash, similar to Square Cash
I’ve used it since it came out. You out money into the Apple Pay Cash via Wallet app, then send it to friends.
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:13:06
It’s not even a credit card directly based on the traditional definition.
It’s literally a cash distribution app, that is likely to be the one that can utilize BTC if Apple was to go into the crypto route.
Remember when Snapchat partnered with square to do a similar thing?

It’s a word... but incorrectly used in the title.

Just curious. If Someone steps forward and revealed themselves as Satoshi Nakamoto, how can we verify that it’s actually him/her.
@_date: 2018-10-27 16:03:10
Oh okay...
I thought I missed something because I stopped paying attention a month ago.
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:46:40
What? 
What was everyone expecting? Was there a big news yesterday? Sorry, I’m out of the loop on this.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:07:28
Make it hidden, like make a forest into a giant Green/Brown QR Code that’s only visible through a Map
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:05:12
Press F3 to look at object entity type behind the lava and just work your way identifying each entity until you can replicated the QR Code.
Yeah it will take a while, but it’s one way to do it.
@_date: 2018-06-07 03:32:44
Got the Porsche... great! More to add to my collection.
I didn’t buy it. It was gift
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:34
Sorry for being dumb, but what does this mean for beginners?
I’m thinking about getting into bitcoin within the next 36 hours.
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:55:50
The Public see April fools day. Businesses just see that it’s now Q2

TBH I’m hoping someone will figure out NFC payments for crypto currency. I prefer tapping on terminals rather than aiming a camera at a QR code even though the Chinese do it all the time.
Peer to peer transactions are fine though, but person to terminal needs NFC capabilities.
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:18:26
It’s personal preference for me, but I think it still needs to be more streamlined, this is too complicated for the normal everyday people even though they can eventually learn it.
Spent the summer there and getting to the payment process is much smoother than doing a crypto transaction. Eventually we will get there, likely sooner.
I do like the idea of entertaining the NFC style transaction, but according to the locals, initial implementation is much more tedious than providing QR Codes.
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:17:02
In Sams Club you can checkout in the middle of the store with the app.
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:39:24
I like to think that the Bluetooth is for viewing/management purposes, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see the ability to take anything out. 
I’ll definitely use it for monitoring funds, but I’ll use the Nano S for actual transactions.
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:48:22
I personally still find the QR code process fairly clunky
I hope eventually transactions can be done similar to Apple Pay or Android Pay, or at least a double tap of the home button or power button triggers a scanner if transactions still use QR code instead of NFC.
