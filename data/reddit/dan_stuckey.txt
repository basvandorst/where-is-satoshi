But on the flip side, if such a ridiculous operation were in place, to try and track cash (which [~30 percent of the USD lives overseas, and is shipped out on pallets of 640,000 $100 bills at a time]( THEN, ALSO, don't we have the right to use these fancy tracking mechanisms as a venue for reassessing liability and responsibility?
At present, if someone steals my cash, or I simply lose it... no one has to reimburse that money. Telling the cops is practically worthless if this happens.
BUT, if great efforts to track cash exist at all these different end-points you're discussing, then don't I have a much better chance to make a claim? Or become reimbursed? And then, how many ATM machines/retailers handling cash will then become the wrongly-targeted epicenters of missing/stolen cash investigations.
What you describe begins to sound like the legal system of India, where when small civil charges are filed, you can wait years for an arraignment or hearing. While the technology to track cash might be 'easy' in theory, the absurd amount of resources it would require to maintain the tracking from a legal justice perspective... well, it's mighty Orwellian.
Kind of how spitting and flicking boogers isn't about to be considered littering.

It's definitely come in handy a couple times, but then again, I'm not one to pay an insurance premium on my cellphone.
