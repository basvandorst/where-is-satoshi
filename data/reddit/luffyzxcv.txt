ikr! I only have guts to buy them when they're low .. but it keeps going up, had only 4 trades this whole week. Btw. is a reversal ocurring now? prices fell from 321.51 to 305, the volumes seems high too..

The only reason I chose MtGox was because of its trading volume and volatility. Since I don't live in the US, my plan is to withdraw BTC and sell them at localbitcoins or something .. ( although I won't get good prices from there, still, it seems to be the only option .. ). But it worries me the fact that people are "migrating" from MtGox to another exchange websites, since it affects its everyday trading volume, and so, little by little it becomes meaningless to use MtGox. I'll send my next "pack" of bitcoins to Bitstamp and see how it works ..
Edit *: Btw, prices now: 319.92, I hope it pop out already, I'm holding USD's and the feeling of "oh! I could've earned a little bit more, and also .. being unable to trade because I might buy it at the highest and sell it low" really s
Any predictions of when will it pop? and what would be the lowest price? based on my little knowledge (few weeks of studying..) and "superficial analysis", my prediction is that.. the lowest might be around 242~244, when will it pop? : no idea :( ..

hahaha ... I could make money with this .. charging about 0.001 btc for each transaction I make .. lol. I just hope that this "pattern" could change..

Hi, it seems that not many people trades there, at least from what I learned through google... So, I just got registered here to post this ..:
Yesterday, I opened an account at BTC China too, I first sent 0.17 btc (from MtGox), did some tradings, and confirmed the trading fees, it is indeed 0.00% ( free ), at least for now..
Later, I transfered all my btcs from MtGox to there, a total of about 0.395 btcs ( not a lot .. hehe ). Since there's no fees, day trading it's much more easier than MtGox, no need to wait for an 1.25% increase, at BTC China, you start making profit with 0.01 Yuan difference. My "fastest day-trading time" was 1 minute, earning 0.194 Yuan from 0.2 btc.
Btw, just to be clear, I'm not trying to promote BTC China, because, i'm stuck with 0.35 btc bought with 1218.13 Yuan, and the price is just going down as I type here ( currently 1195 Yuan, yeah, quite sad .. for someone who has been trading for about 8 days.. newbie ).
Just like the OP, I would like to see more opinions about this exchange website.
(*** and .. a good news - for me, price went up to 1.200, not stuck anymore xD )
About the Withdrawal Process, I haven't try it yet, from what I've looked, it didn't seem to be complicated, I'll check it later and post it here.
More infos:
- MtGox BTC withdraw, took me 0.005 BTC for each transaction, they all arrived within an hour. (success)
(last price as I send this message: 1208.91 Yuan)
Edit.: *** I looked wrong at the price.. they were not sold .. yet.., I'm waiting for 1.218.99 .. lol
Edit2: A better look at btc withdraw option, it only takes the bitcoin amount to send, and trade password as input, 2 ways of seeting the bitcoin address: - email contact, and 2-Factor Authentication, both of them seems to be troublesome... though it seems for a better security or something ..

lol.. for me it's harder to buy than to sell..
selling, at worst, will make you earn less ...
buying, at worst, will make you loss great ..
everytime I buy, prices go down, and everytime I sell, prices go up ...90% of times .. I can only recover some hours later, sometimes .. days.. I'm about to get used to it .. haha

right now, I believe that its popping, its 292.875 as I type here .. my heart is beating like there's no tomorrow.. lol, at what price should I buy?? 265 ? 245? .. what if it falls to 100 and I have no cash to buy them ?? any help??
Edit* 1 hour later, 303.99.. I hope that it's not a retracement ..
