Thanks Guys. ''Twas confirmed a bit ago. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:53:58
Check if your transaction is confirmed. That would be the first step.

Thanks.

I guess you don't understand what my post meant. I'm not complaining about Bitcoin, its fees nor waiting. My point is, ShapeShift received my deposit promptly and swiftly but failed to exchange promptly like they've always done. I've been a bitcoin user for 2 years 6 months and I love every bit of it. Payeer isn't an option for me. Anyway, thanks for your suggestion.

The same happened to me earlier this morning too. I didn't want to create a post on that but seeing yours.. just thought I write it out. It's a big +.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:58:24
Okay. Thanks

Yesterday GMT 7:30 pm, the transaction fees was $1.68.  I was like surprised. Also at 4pm, the transaction fees was $0.88.
 I remember the days of $0.15 transaction fees few weeks back. I hope we go back to those days. I hope we aint heading for a $5 transaction fees.

Breadwallet on iOS is perfect too. I see you stated you don't have an Android. If you are using an iOS, download the breadwallet app, back up(and write out the 12 seed phrase)- this is the most important aspect coz the seed phrase is what you need if something happens to your phone- prolly if
you can't access your phone or its stolen. 
While you wait for your hardware wallet from Amazon, you may want to use breadwallet on iOS. It's safe too. 
What the other comment meant with the browser is that- unknowingly to you, there might be a malware in your computer that tends to change the public address- at which you want to send the funds to. They do this to divert your coins. You'll think you sending the coins to yourself but it's actually gone elsewhere. That usually happens in the process of copying and pasting. So you might want to double check to be sure you are pasting the correct address. 
That's one of the reason why the hardware wallets are safer- they have several measures in place and are not prone to malware attacks even if your computer is compromised. 
I hope this helps.

Thank you!

Thank you introshine. I just checked and the 9 ether is credited. I'm going to update this post to that but mean while, why did that happen? How come I saw a different address on the block chain when I traced and nothing in my account  immediately the transaction was dne but now its credited? I'm not an expert here but I've been doing exchanges for a while now and even on shape shift and it credits my address and not some other address. The fact I saw another address made me skeptical. I know this bitcoin, I wanted to post this everywhere for awareness since shape shift exchange several coins even bitcoin. I just didn't want someone else to be a Victim.

Circle is no more buying and selling btc. You may want to check for the closest Btc ATM.

Thanks! Finally got from another ATM. The customer service helped me out. I guess the ATM had problems reading the QR code. That's why it was taking me back to the main screen each time I try to scan the QR. Thanks, your comment was helpful. It gave me the courage to visit another ATM.

Please, be very careful with where you buy bitcoins from online. Especially random websites given from random people here. There are a lot of scammers out there pretending to sell bitcoins online. You send them money and you'll wait forever to hear from there. You may want to check out popular platforms like localbitcoin. You still have to careful though. Well known exchangers would have been safer. My two cents!

Been buying from coinbase for over 8 months. It takes 5 business working days for you to get your btc. Via ACH bank transfer. In fact last week, it was changed to 6 business days. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 11:54:59
I'm barely new to Bitcoin. About 1 year in. I have few bitcoins and other coins. Is other altcoin gonna have problems soon? Or is he just kidding? Most times I look up here to relative information on digital currencies. I'm somewhat confused. Can you plz explain further in noob terms?
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:35:59
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:53:37
It's coinucopia. Heading to another ATM. I guess it's not a general problem. I hope it works. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-01-23 01:08:06
Known scam
@_date: 2017-01-28 00:39:00
Not sure what you guys are talking about. I've been regularly buying from coinbase for 8 months and it's been 5 business days. In fact 2 weeks ago, it changed to 6 days. Got the btc I ordered last week today and nothing changed. Been buying via ACH with Wellsfargo. 
They haven't improved but rather worse. 
You guys shouldn't hype coinbase services. They ain't getting any better.

Yes it is the same. Thank you introshine. I just checked and the 9 ether is credited. I'm going to update this post to that but mean while, why did that happen? Can you be kind enough to explain to me? How come I saw a different address on the block chain when I traced and nothing in my account  immediately the transaction was dne but now its credited? I'm not an expert here but I've been doing exchanges for a while now and even on shape shift and it credits my address and not some other address. The fact I saw another address made me skeptical. I know this bitcoin, I wanted to post this everywhere for awareness since shape shift exchange several coins even bitcoin. I just didn't want someone else to be a Victim.

That's really crazy. 10Btc? Next time, you should buy and immediately transfer to a wallet you own its private keys. Hopefully, they should tell you why they suspended your account pretty soon. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:02:11
I would not trust paxful too. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 02:42:14
Yes. Both of them on 1 Nano wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 11:07:48
Tucari, I'm not here to witch hunt shape shift, I only explained what happened to me and gave my advise. Like I stated, I have used shape shift severally with outstanding success but if something fishing comes up, I should let people know so they don't fall a victim. That's my motive of posting. I don't need to genuinely think of anything. I'm going to continue to be return customer and even spread the good news of their outstanding service if they keep to their side of the business and if they fail to, I'll not fail to let every one know that they are not yo be trusted. Meanwhile, I will update this post now.

Thanks for the info. The fee was $0.77. This is really making me have a bad day.
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:43:22
The confirmed transaction fee was $0.68 while the unconfirmed is $0.77 and its almost the same amount. Just wondering if there's anything I can do to help this situation.
