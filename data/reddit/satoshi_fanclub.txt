When you say "1 MB legacy transactions are 4x as large", what is the actual disk size of the transaction?
e.g. What physical size is a "Full Block" on my disk with 100% segwit tx's as opposed to one with 90% or more legacy transactions?

But the nodes dont *actually* create the blocks, right? I mean you could verify a tx, but I, as a miner, could just push it to the back of the queue, right?  Nodes can be switched on at very little cost, right? so how do you prevent a cheap sybil attack if the nodes are doing all the checking, as you suggest?

The manner in which ptodd and others exploited it (only after it was published) is a prime example of how fundamentally sick the Bitcoin environment is. You will always default to dog eat dog. Its in your nature - you cant help it.
A p2p network will never work like that. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 23:41:49
In that context, it has failed. Just look at what ptodd has done. What MP has threatened to do. What blockstream have done. And any other lunatic can do it too. The bitcoin network can be destroyed in hours if enough of its supporters get sufficiently butthurt. Bitcoin is all about the control. The "I must win at any price" cohort will prevail.

Why not simply change the line in the code, compile and start mining with a constant ( or even increasing) supply of coinbase coins? Its really simple. Go for it!

Hmmm, okay. I meant Market in a similar way to how you use "Community".
Let me rephrase: rational actors will follow their best interest. buyers will buy coins on the best secured network. Miners will point their rigs at the chain with the most tx's. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:01:27

Q, Why is Bitcoin predisposed to fail?
A. Please see this post. 
Clue?  Anything done to BU will be done to Core.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:30:16
When this case is triggered, you would usually want a core dump to sift through afterwards.
as stated, the assert is not the problem.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:17:26
BU supporters have deliberately spun up 100's of nodes reporting 'core' but will switch to 'bu' when the time is right. You cant really trust these numbers, james hilliard has made them largely meaningless. blocks/1000 is the only metric that you want to watch.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:17:47

I see what you did there!! :-)
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:02:54
Market will follow where the majority of the hashpower goes. The " kill the minority chain" was a core strategy from the XT days, but it wont come to it now because if there is a switch at all, there will be to many peta's on the BU chain. The losers will probably try to adopt a scorched earth policy, but it would be pointless. Better a chain thats valuable that you dont agree with than agreeing with a valueless one.
The 'community' ( for whatever influence they have} will be pragmatic. Money talks. They will follow the money.

@_date: 2017-03-24 17:27:04
Thats ridiculous. The miners do the work, expend the energy towards building a chain that best represents the consensus. If that consensus changes. miners enforce it. Thats where their power comes from. If you dont like it, you simply build on a chain that you do like.

Of course. Competition and free choice are, not withstanding Gregs hopes and dreams, the cornerstone of the bitcoin ecosystem. But I strongly feel that its a game for the specialists in the field, and any attempt to sink large amounts of coin based largely on momentary pique would be futile.

UASF is just a drunk guy in a bar talking a great fight. As soon as he gets out on the street, he falls on his ass. There are too many ways for UASF to go horribly wrong - with or without greater miner support. Nobody in any position of influence in bitcoin will allow it to get to the point where it may deploy.
If it did, its supporters would be on a minority chain within 100 blocks, and 3 months later would likely find that everything they did was wiped out in a moment.
@_date: 2017-05-18 22:40:09


Not really. Why do we have BASE_BLOCKSIZE and BLOCK_SERIALIZED separately defined? You either dont fully understand the semantics involved or you are simply trying to bluff your way through. 
Nobody mentioned 'seperate file' (except you) so you can drop that strawman. Its an effective increase only, one that has no impact on traditional tx's but greatly favours sig heavy tx's

Probably the most sensible thing you said in this thread.....
Anyhoo, look at those figures again. Bitfury reckon that 1MB (what we have now) "immediately excludes 20% of Nodes" So take the rest of their figures by a factor of 0.5.  You wont see large scale exclusion of "could not really be bothered" non mining nodes until we are at 20MB.
I know your mulish belief in Core dogma wont allow you to grok it, but thats the story.

I think you need to start reading things as they are, and not what you want them to be. These nodes are not mining nodes, simply do gooders running non mining nodes. We can do without them. Anyway, segwit is increasing blocksize to the point where most amateur nodes will no longer be viable.

Where are you going with your strawman "90% of Nodes" dropping off the network? a 2-4Mb block will have no such impact. Maybe at 20Mb or higher, but by then the network will be so busy there is absolutely no point in spectating on other peoples transactions.

Go to git, list the devs by order of commits. By the time you are through the first page of devs, you are into single digit commits. Please dont flog the "100's of devs" shite.   Of the main devs, blockstream is involved with most, either directly as shareholders/founders or 'consultants' Its ludicrous to pretend otherwise. 


You can put lipstick on a pig, but its still a pig. In 2015, anything 1MB+ would get you a ban on bitcointalk. For various political reasons ( the fact that it was an untenable stand for one) the position has emiliorated to "2-4MB isOK, but only on our terms" which is just as bad. Because "on out terms" means crippling Bitcoin as a payment network in favour of a centralised L2 solution. Its this deliberate hamstringing of Bitcoin that I -and most blockstream opponents - object to.
. The only dishonesty here is from Roger Ver and Jihan Wu
Ah, you have forgotten Andreesen, Hearn, Garzik? Ver and Jihan are only the latest in your long list of "Public Enemies" that you put up in order to personalise a fight that you cannot win on technical grounds. Some of the best contributors to bitcoin have been demonized and exiled because they dont share the vision that the deliberate crippling of bitcoin is good for business.

You clearly dont, If you still labour under the delusion that miners somehow broke the agreement by 'waiting' for Core to release something they were clearly never going to even contemplate.

Its time to shake that yoke from your shoulder and start thinking independently again.

Except that 'users' are miners and they *are* making the decisions.

A long rant that ends in veiled threats of violence. Thats the best you will ever be able to do.
There is little point in pointing out the weakness of your arguments because you will simply resort to more overt threats to persons and property you disagree with. 
In the end of the day you will need to UASF if you want to have your way. And I will look forward to that day. You can spend the rest of your time trying to figure out why they told you it would take 12 months to arrange a HF but went with a non miner backed UASF (which will result in a HF) in just 2 months.
Genuinely, I hope it happens. And we can start rebuilding bitcoin as a p2p payment network without 3rd parties, while you will continue to pump your alt coin into a "store of value" and the new "digital gold" while preparing for the "moon"
Good riddance, ya loony!

Its the overtly dishonest tactics used by core to muddy this issue that has brought us here. Small blockers did not want 2MB or more, not because of HF risks but decentralisation due to blockchain growth, Yet segwit was cheered despite the fact that it increases the size of the blockchain equally. Its takes a special kind of stupid not to see the dishonesty. 


This is exactly what SW does, if your replace your childishly derogatory term "n00b" with "legacy nodes" How else did you think the SF sham would work? 


Yes. And it was completely intentional. Hence the dishonestly and the subsequent opposition to Cores tactics. I mean, it is really a mess. Where else in software do you see a block level commitment being stored in an individual record? Not in the block header, but a *record*. And why? All to avoid a HF, which would have solved the issue in a more elegant manner, but of course would have obviated part of the changes raison d'etre.
Thats dishonesty. Thats mortgaging the future of bitcoin for a short term political ( and economic) gain.

Cool. Then you know what to do.
Thats the beauty of Bitcoin. You always have a choice.
Good bye.

Correct. The most compelling evidence of ordering a hit was provoked and orchestrated by an FBI investigator working  undercover.  But no evidence was ever found other than a couple of nerds going full-COD on an online forum.

As someone who goes back to rcsid's and cvs, I have one thing to say to you - fuck you, you enormous ignorant cunt.

Some of the mis-attributions appear to have been corrected at some point.

They are rarely physically overwritten unless the device was 90-95% full for a period of time. If the files were small, then its highly probable that the data sectors are untouched.

I never said that it wasn't a screwup with the import - this has never been 
The fact that it remained uncorrected for so long was the issue.( the point I made in my post)
As for "narrative", the archive explains the point entirely - work that was not that of gmax was 'being described' ( is that better? ) as his. The snapshot from the thread gives a clear example of someone being misled.
You have (wrongly) assumed that I dont know anything of how git works, but so what? Its not the issue. 
I've made my point, backed up with the archive. Your explanation is a text book example of an attempt to [bamboozle your way out of the substantive issue]( And there are no shortage of bamboozle experts in r/bitcoin
