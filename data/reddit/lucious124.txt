I was trying to be nice but you're right.
@_date: 2019-07-07 00:27:28
I was thinking exactly the same.  He needs to start with English 90.

@_date: 2019-03-20 23:53:31
Ah another man discovering what a price is.
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:59:29
Damn I was gonna make a Trezor joke too but you beat me to it.  Well played.
@_date: 2019-03-20 01:02:40
He's gonna have to get one of those embeddable nanochips except it needs to run a full Bitcoin node.  That'll be one hot ass.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:57:31
Really?!?!! I never would have guessed.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:56:20
I'm truly baffled by how much this question is asked.  I would think people who were interested in Bitcoin would be technically literate enough to do a basic Google search or hell search this subreddit for any of the answers that are provided 12 times a day to this same question.
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:36:14
Can someone please put a "how to use Google" guide on this subreddit's sidebar?

If the U.S. starts going full Venezuela and the dollar starts inflating anywhere near the 1,000,000% that the Bolivar has experienced then definitely.  1 Satoshi =1,000,000,000.

I don't recall hearing anyone call gold God's money ever in my entire life so I have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:36:50
Yeah that's true.  I expect to make a chunk of change off this bear market, but that's not what's gonna make me rich.  That's just seed money.
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:30:47
Not really and I don't even have very much Bitcoin anyways.  Mostly altcoins with good developers.
@_date: 2019-02-27 15:25:08
Yeah I know.  I was joking.  I thought it was pretty obvious but I guess it is the internet.
@_date: 2019-02-24 06:48:51
That price was just a joke, but I do think Bitcoin is probably going to moon again for a few reasons.  The first is the standard talking points that Bitcoin is digital gold that's scarce, secure, and decentralized, but many people have said that other cryptos are built with better, more efficient, consensus algorithms, and you might just be right, but Bitcoin does have the first mover advantage and is somewhat of a household name.
When people really start looking into the potential of crypto the first thing that's gonna come to their mind is Bitcoin, and the lightning network is already helping mitigate some of Bitcoin's weaknesses. 
I don't have timeline for when Bitcoin moons again or even what price it'll be, but it'll probably be after institutional money really starts flowing into crypto through Fidelity and Bakkt, and any number of other avenues that are opening up.

How many?  I only have 27k BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-11 02:44:13
No Bitcoin will hit $7 in 10k days.  That's when Bitcoin 2 takes over.
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:49:36
At 20k I'll buy a lambo of course, but when it reaches 80k that's when I buy the companies Lamborghini and Tesla and make an automated electric lambo.

We need to stop being so grossly conservative like McAfee and Novograts, and be bold but realistic with our Bitcoin pricing.  $3,000,000,000 by September. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 02:53:49
FOMO ACTIVATE!
@_date: 2019-04-29 05:19:00
One day the entire world will have to use a single Bitcoin.  A single Satoshi will be worth $10,000,000,000.  That might actually make an interesting basis for a sci-fi movie.
@_date: 2019-04-29 07:07:50
Thanks man.  I appreciate you calling out this obvious copy and paste.  He could have at least changed it a little.
@_date: 2019-04-10 23:30:51
What do you mean by the only use?  That's an incredibly valuable utility that reduces the risk of aquiring drugs by orders of magnitude.  Instead of going out on the street corner to buy drugs you can read some reviews of online retailers and use a decentralized network to pay for said goods.  That's just as valid as using Bitcoin to buy a sandwhich or pay your bus fare or any other economic activity.

He should have posted his dogecoin address.  The memes would bless him.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:35:14
You still need an ID for that I'm pretty sure.

Most convincing Reddit ad/shitpost I've seen.  Reminds me of when a homeless man asked me for change to get a beer.  I gave him a $10 for the honesty.  I'm not going to look at your channel but I will give you an upvote and snort a line for you.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:03:07
Yeah I have the suspicion that a recession might cause the crypto market to really MOON.  And depending on how the federal reserve reacts it might just UBER-MOON.  imagine the federal reserve having a conniption fit on their printing presses.  Cue hyperinflation and look at that Bitcoin is now $1,000,000,000.
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:26:22
The central banks put pressure on Google to use Bitcoin by raising interest rates on their loans?  Why would the central bank want to Google to use their main competitor?  That's a grade F conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2019-05-09 03:46:25
First you have to have a mind for me to change it.  Get back to me when you've done that and presented a single point as to why the LN is not peer to peer.
