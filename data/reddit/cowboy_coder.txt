You can still receive before the client completes the blockchain sync.  The client just won't be aware of the transaction until finished. 
If you want to confirm that the transaction processed, you could use  HTTP://blockchain.info to search for the receiving address.  Since the blockchain is public, all transactions will be visible to you there (even before your client is aware).
BTW, Electrum is generally a preferred client for new users.  Or Mycellium for Android.  Neither require a full blockchain sync.

Bitinstant was originally a mechanism receive USD credit at Mt Gox, by depositing cash at major banks or buying credits from retailers like CVS and Walmart.   If you wanted to use ACH to deposit, you had to use another intermediary: Dwolla.   Mt Gox also accepted Liberty Reserve digital currency.
Later Bitinstant partnered with another company to sell bitcoins to noobs, skipping MtGox.  I forgot the name, but I beleive the other company was originally founded to send bitcoins via email and SMS.  Edit: Coinapult was the partner

It's analogous to silver.

When you buy bitcoins from Circle, they probably buy from an exchange.   Circle doesn't instantly receive dollars from the credit card processor, so they must have a pool of money designated for buying bitcoins.  Demand today is probably so high that their allocated pool of funds has been extinguished.  Circle could either allocate more money to that pool, or wait until they receive dollars from credit card processors.

Just speculating based on how they could operate.  They obviously don't have an unlimited supply of bitcoins, so they must buy from an exchange, and bank transfers to an exchange take time.  
Coinbase used to have this problem daily during rallies.  Presumably they expanded their pool.  Operating their own exchange now probably also helps.

Here's a basic explanation of Bitcoin: 
To understand mining, start with the blockchain. It is a sequential chain of blocks.  Each block contains a list of transactions since the last block.  Whoever creates the next block gets to keep the reward plus all the transaction fees included in the block.  So miners (or pools of miners) are all competing with each other to create the next block.  To keep block generation rate steady at ~10 minutes per block, the difficulty of mining adjusts based on whether blocks are being creating too quickly or too slowly.

Use a payment processor such as Bitpay or Coinbase.  
They will allow you choose to have between 0% and 100% of the bitcoins you receive automatically exchanged to dollars.  
The simplest way to handle the accounting is to choose to have 100% of the bitcoins exchanged to dollars.  Then you never actually touch any bitcoins, you just have dollars deposited into your bank account.  All accounting and taxes could then be handled as normal dollar-denominated sales.

Suppose you receive 4 bitcoins with address A and 6 bitcoins with address B. You have 10 total bitcoins in your wallet. Now you want to send 7 bitcoins to someone, but neither A nor B have 7 bitcoins.  So the transaction uses both A and B as inputs.

I assume you're trolling as usual, but I'll explain for anyone else confused.
Yes the blockchain allows us to know the balances of addresses.  But most people's wallets consist of multiple addresses.  And some addresses hold the balances of multiple people (a cold storage address used by Coinbase for example).   
So you still have no way to know how many people use bitcoin, nor their individual wallet balances.
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:57:44


No. You can speculate, but there's no way to know.  The blockchain is public, so you can view the balance of each address.  But most bitcoins wallets contain many addresses.  And some addresses contain bitcoins belonging to multiple people (a cold storage address used by Coinbase for example).  So it's impossible to accurately measure bitcoin wealth distribution.

Electrum is actually creating a [deterministic wallet]( for you based on a seed phrase.
Blockchain.info on the other hand is simply giving you a mnemonic password.  They keep your actual wallet, so your wallet can still be stolen.   Also if blockchain.info were to disappear, that passphrase would not help you to access your bitcoins.
Electrum generates the wallet locally (and it gets erased as soon as you shutdown the Ubuntu live disc).  You could also use Electrum's seed phrase elsewhere, such as CarbonWallet.com or Brainwallet.org.  (although be aware typing it into insecure websites would be a security risk)

Performing such work would require centralization to distribute work and validate results.

People have already investigated the blockchain to determine that a large bulk of MtGox's cold storage bitcoins have not been moved.  That means they were not stolen.

If you use one address for receiving all payments, anyone who knows that address would know your total balance.

You just earned a loyal customer. From now on, Tigerdirect will be the first place I check for computer parts.
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:33:06
Many reasons.  Maintaining miners requires your time.  You have to check it throughout the day and night to make sure it is connected, performing properly, cooling adequately, etc.  To stay competitive you have to keep up with forums, which mining software performs best, which pools pay best, how fast is the difficulty rising and when do I need to sell this equipment to buy more, which companies have good reputations, etc.  It can quickly become a full-time job.  
That is assuming you can even buy ASICs in a timely manner.  Usually you can't.  ASIC manufactures keep the hardware and mine with it themselves before shipping it to you.  This raises the difficulty and makes the equipment almost obsolete by the time you get it.  So unless you have an inside connection with a manufacturer (or your own hardware engineering degree) you aren't going to ever get your hands on profitable equipment.  Professional miners probably buy in bulk perhaps get priority shipments.

In the case of Cyprus, many citizens had the bank balances confiscated because the banks were insolvent.  Banks were shut down for weeks, driving all commerce to a screeching halt.

Yeah, they are created by a mining program on the computer.  In theory you could do all of the math manually, but it would probably take 1000 years.  So in practice it would be impossible to manually calculate it fast enough.  Each new block must be linked to the last on the blockchain.  So when a new block is created (about every 10 minutes), miners must start working on a new block linked to the last block created.

As someone else said, the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, not two weeks.  So the problem would be, if all miners suddenly quit except one, that the difficulty would be too high for a single miner to produce any blocks.  So we would never get the 2016 blocks needed for the next difficulty adjustment.  
However if miners gradually quit, blocks would still be produced, so the difficulty can adjust itself as needed to scale down to only one miner. 
Also, one miner would be fine. There's no need for two.  Satoshi mined by himself for a little while until others decided to participate.  (Obviously more miners are better since it makes the blockchain more secure.)

Use Coinbase to request payments.  Then each payment can be associated with a name, account number, or invoice number.


They sound confused here. There's no need for the company to access a customer bank account.  The company should use Coinbase or Bitpay, then dollars will be automatically deposited into their account.  There's no need for them to ever actually touch any bitcoins.


The fee does not vary with the conversion rate.  It is a flat fee, usually ~1%.  Coinbase offers 0% fees for the first million dollars of sales.






So if payment are already 0% fees, they could choose to pass along the 1% fee to customers paying in bitcoin.  (or take advantage of Coinbase's 0% offer)


No argument there, other than use is expanding and might be more common in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:32:55
The blockchain is a sequential chain of blocks. Each block contains a list of transactions since the last block. Whoever creates the next block gets to keep the reward plus all the transaction fees included in the block. So miners (or pools of miners) are all competing with each other to create the next block. To keep block generation rate steady at ~10 minutes per block, the difficulty of mining adjusts based on whether blocks are being creating too quickly or too slowly.  The more miners, the more difficult to create a block.  This creates security for transactions, because to reverse a transaction, you would have to recreate old blocks, which is very difficult because of so many miners.

Nothing more than baseless speculation.  
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:39:30
Faster confirmation times would mean less security per block, since each block would be easier to create.  If Bitcoin's block generation were changed from 10 minutes to 5 minutes, sites that currently require 6 confirmations would instead want 12 confirmations.
Sites requiring 6 confirmations are probably exchanges, not retailers.  Retailers typically accept 0 confirmations.  Exchanges require so many confirmations so you can't withdraw a deposit that isn't 99.999999% sure to be permanent.  When considering mainstream adoption, sending to an exchange is more comparable to a bank wire transfer (which takes 5-7 business days) than to a credit card transaction.


Other businesses aren't going to follow suit unless they allow payouts which would put them at risk.
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:31:49
Yeah mention TigerDirect and quote their sales boost.  
Mention that a payment processor such as Bitpay/Coinbase removes all risk of volatility.  They also simply accounting, since all accounting and taxes can still be calculated as normal dollar sales.
Mention that you could save 1-2% in fees versus credit cards.  If you have a slim profit margin then a couple percent makes a big difference.
The biggest advantage is zero fraud.  The last time I bought from Dell, they froze my order for about a week until it cleared their fraud department.   It was a huge hassle for me as a customer, and I imagine it is also a hassle for Dell to deal with fraud.  Bitcoin eliminates such problems for both of us.

GPUs are already obsolete for mining bitcoins.  Anyone mining bitcoins with a GPU has already switched to mining a scrypt-based altcoin (litecoin and dogcoin).  
If you meant an obsolete ASIC, those are specialized for performing only SHA-256 hashes, so they *can't* be used with a scrypt-based altcoin.

No, the fees would be prohibitively costly for such tiny transactions.


I'm not sure what you mean by that.  Every transaction in the blockchain is equally visible. 


Sure, you can break up large transactions into many smaller ones, creating a maze that would be difficult to follow.  Although sophisticated analysis techniques exist that attempt to follow these trails.

Here's someone else's explanation of mining: 
You may want to research and discuss how the blockchain solves the [double spending]( problem in a decentralized fashion.  Usually to prevent double spending you would need a central administrator, such as your bank, to record and validate transactions.  Compare and contrast Bitcoin to David Chaum's e-cash which was anonymous cash, but still required a central administrator.
You may want to also research and discuss the possibility of a 51% mining attack, which is the only way to double-spend bitcoins.

Blockchain.info does not have unencrypted copies of your private keys.  The keys are encrypted and decrypted client-side, in  your webbrowser.  Because of this, they shouldn't be able to steal from your wallet. (Unless they were to do something sneaky such as change their JS code to capture your passphrase without telling you.)
Some online wallets, such as Coinbase, do not give you the private keys.  They have complete control of your bitcoins.

Ok, suppose the miner is NY creates a new block.  The miner in DC could chose to ignore it, basically trying to fork the blockchain. But that's incredibly unlikely to succeed, so they'd only be costing themselves lost mining revenue.  Miners have every incentive to only try creating new blocks on the longest blockchain.  
So the DC miner will begin working a new block to follow NY's newly created block.  The DC miner will drop any transactions that were included (or otherwise made invalid) by the NY miner's block.
In regard to miners seeing transactions and new blocks at different times, that's why the average block creation time is set to 10 minutes, to allow for plenty of time for propagation around the p2p network.

Mt Gox sucks for a number of reasons.  You would have to first verify your identity by submitting personal documents, then wait weeks for approval. Then you'd have to send an international wire transfer to Japan, which is not cheap.  And at the moment you can't even withdraw your bitcoins from Gox. Stay far, far away from them.
Coinbase is so much better. They link to your bank account similar to Paypal.  And they are much, much easier to use.

I'd send invoices via Coinbase.  
With a merchant account, they offer 0% fees for the first million dollars received, and 1% after that.  You can opt to have Coinbase convert 100% of your bitcoins into dollars which are automatically deposited into your bank account.  That way your bookkeeper can account for everything in dollars as usual.
The fee to buy the bitcoins will vary based on which exchange your client uses.  One of the more popular services in Australia, [Coinjar]( charges 2% to buy bitcoins, although they could probably find a cheaper option if they look around.

Do you know how the order book works?  You place buy and sell orders at your desired price then wait for it to fulfill.  If you are really eager to sell or buy, you accept the price of someone else's existing orders.  So eager buyers/sellers are what really move the price, as they come in and eat up existing orders.
Watch this for a little while:  
Look at the lower graph and zoom in a little bit.  The red line represents the volume of sell orders.  The green line represents the volume of buy orders.  If you hover your mouse over those lines, it will tell you the amount of buys or sells to reach that level.

How would you propose performing "useful work" using only a decentralized p2p protocol?  Solving work would require centralization to distribute work and validate results. If Bitcoin were to become a centralized network, then it defeats the purpose of mining anyway, which is to achieve a consensus amongst untrusted network nodes, aka the [Byzantine Generals problem]( in computer science.
Maybe there is some yet-to-be-invented novel design that could achieve that goal while also performing other "useful" tasks, but it is not a trivial problem.

Fortunately you don't have to install Linux, just run it from a live boot disk.  Download the latest Ubuntu ISO and burn it to a CD/DVD.   Boot the disc and tell it you want to try Ubuntu without installing.

2) Update the directory: `sudo apt-get update`

Paypal's funding options are still reversible.  In the case of identity theft, the thief could simply send an irreversible transaction from the stolen account.  The victim later sees the charge on a bank statement, disputes it with the bank, leaving Paypal to cover the theft.
In the case of fraud, scam artists would convince users that they need an irreversible transaction for whatever reason.  The gullible victim sends the money to Nigeria or wherever, not realizing there is no protection offered by Paypal.  Again the victim goes to the bank to reverse the charge, leaving Paypal to cover the theft.

£5 isn't worth suing anyway, but even if you wanted, how would you know who to sue?  Is this tor exchange going to keep a copy of everyone's passport?  Then give out personally identifying information with every fraud claim?  Sounds like a good way to have your identity stolen.
Even then, all the scammer has to do is claim that a hacker stole his bank details.  He gets off free.  There is no proof otherwise.   Sure you could show logs, but that doesn't prove that the actual account holder performed the transaction, just that *somebody* did.
Also keep in mind bank transfer fees, which would make small transfers prohibitively costly.

In this example, to facilitate offline transactions you as a customer would deposit $25 worth of bitcoins as store credit with starbucks. When you purchase a coffee starbucks debits some of your credit, but the transaction doesn't involve the blockchain. So if you buy coffee five times, that's five total transactions but only one transaction on the blockchain.
Or another possibility: consider that all transactions from one Coinbase account to another Coinbase account are performed off the blockchain. If Starbucks uses Coinbase as a merchant payment processor, and their customers use a Coinbase mobile wallet, none of those transactions would be on the blockchain.

GPU mining directly for bitcoins has been made obsolete by ASICs.  But you can still mine for altcoins and get paid in bitcoins.
My guide to GPU mining:
* Assuming you have a Radeon, for OpenCL support you need the [AMD APP SDK](
* Next you need a [mining client]( that supports Scrypt.  Make sure you specify the '-scrypt' option when you run it.
* Then you'll need a mining pool that allows scrypt mining yet pays in bitcoins:   
* If you don't yet have a Bitcoin wallet, download [Electrum]( and use a receiving address as your username for connecting to Middlecoin.
* Once you've been mining a while, [check your status](

To start, the fees are cheaper than credit cards. Coinbase offers 0% fee for the first million dollars of sales. 
Secondly, you'll have zero risk of chargebacks.  So no need to verify customer identify such as with a credit card.  Customers like this as well, since it is less hassle.
Third, there's a possibility that it will attract a few customers who might not otherwise have been interested.  It might give your business a cool-factor, especially if you accept it before your competitors.

It works right now with Counterparty.  You issue assets which can be sent from one bitcoin address to another.  These assets can also be purchased and sold for bitcoins via decentralized exchange, with no third-party escrow needed.

Addresses are actually public keys.  Every public key has a corresponding private key.  (So a wallet is actually a collection of private keys.)  
If you were to have a private key, but forget the public key, no problem.  You can derive the public key from the private key if you need.
If you lose a private key but still have the corresponding public key, you're screwed.  By design, a public key can not be used to send bitcoins.  That's what makes it safe to make public.

No, MtGox does not allow withdrawals of dollars, preventing arbitrage.


When you store it offline you probably print a private key.  To later spend the balance, you need to import the key into a wallet.
If using Coinbase, the feature is found under Account -&gt; Integrations -&gt; "Import a paper wallet".
In the case of blockchain.info/wallet, it's "Import Private Key" under "Import/Export",

These spam transactions never get included in the blockchain.  Miners, who are responsible for creating blocks and including transactions in created blocks, ignore these spam transactions because they didn't include a sufficient fee.
If a transaction never gets included in a block, it might as well have never happened.  No bitcoins can be moved without the transaction getting included in a block.
As to the purpose of the spam?   Sometimes transaction spam is promotional, for example if a gambling site wanted you to come visit.  But the 1Enjoy and 1Sochi spam doesn't seem to lead anywhere.  The only purpose would seem to be to spread FUD, in an attempt to lower the price.  Soooo many people have been posting in that they've received strange transactions, thinking they've "been hacked" and that their bitcions are at risk of being stolen.  Even though the spam is no danger, people don't understand it, fear it, and lose confidence in Bitcoin.

There could be many reasons, but my first guess would be that it allows them to keep ~97% of their bitcoins in cold storage (in bank vaults).  As soon as you receive bitcoins to one of your addresses, Coinbase resends the bitcoins to one of their cold storage addresses.  That would leave the balance of your receiving addresses always at 0.

The core data structure of Bitcoin is the blockchain.  It is a sequential list of blocks (ie, a chain of blocks).  Each block contains a record of all transactions since the last block.   Mining is the process of creating new blocks.  All miners are competing to create the next block.  The miner (or pool of miners) that successfully create the block get a reward (currently 25 bitcoins) and they get to keep all the transaction fees from transactions recorded in that block.

I would ask for citation/elaboration as to why that is a requirement for "validity."  Dollars have not been backed by anything physical since 1971 when [Nixon put the final nail in the coffin]( of the [gold standard]( 


User experience has improved vastly over the past five years.  There's no reason to think that will not continue to improve.  Compare the Internet of 1994 to 2014.  
Or compare credit card purchases in the 1980s and 1990s to today.  Merchants used to have to make a carbon copy of the card, to later file with the credit card company.  When the first electronic POS systems came about, they had to wait at least 30secons per transaction for the modem to dial a number then connect and validate a transaction.  It was not smooth whatsoever.

Transactions can have multiple inputs (and multiple outputs).
Suppose you have a wallet with two addresses and a combined balance of 7 bitcoins.  Address A contains 4 bitcoins and address B contains 3. 
Suppose you wanted to send 1 bitcoins to someone, address C.  Your wallet composes a transaction such as:
`Use the balance of A to send 1 bitcoin to C and 3 bitcoins back to A`
(The change in this example is sent back to A, however often wallets will generate a new address for change)
Now suppose instead you wanted to send 6 bitcoins to someone. Neither A nor B by themselves have enough, so the wallet creates a transactions using multiple inputs, such as:
`Use the balance of A and balance of B to send 6 bitcoins to C and 1 bitcoin back to A`

Try wiring money internationally.  It will take at least five days, excluding weekends and banking holidays.  Not to mention the high fees.
Are you comparing Bitcoin to Paypal?  If so remember Paypal is reversible for up 180 days.  So you should be comparing ~20 minutes for an irreversible bitcoin transaction versus 180 days.


Accepting bitcoins is a benefit to businesses because it eliminates fraudulent credit card problems.  There are no chargebacks!  Not to mention the relatively low fees.
Users can access bitcoin without any bank account.  That means that the billions of "unbankable" people around the world could still access bitcoin.

Paypal uses ACH bank transfers (in the USA anyway) which are reversible.  Bank wire transfers are more difficult to reverse, but they are also more expensive and less convenient, often requiring you to personally go to the bank to fill out a form for the transfer.

Yeah Electrum generates your entire wallet from that 12-word phrase.  And unlike a normal paper wallet which only contains one address, this is an entire wallet of unlimited addresses.   
Yeah, when you run Electrum that first time it will be creating an entirely new wallet for you.  You can send send and receive to/from other wallets such as blockchain.info.  
Send a little bit to Electrum at first as a test.  Then to make sure everything is working as you expect, reboot Ubuntu and recreate the wallet from the 12-word phrase.  If you see your balance still there, you'll know you did everything correctly and you didn't write the words down wrong or anything.
You may want to also write down one or two of your receiving addresses from Electrum, or add them to your blockchain.info address book.  That way you can conveniently send to Electrum without having to boot up Ubuntu to find your receiving addresses.  Or you can use the addresses to check your balance without booting

You could send money internationally to Bitstamp, but I suspect the wire transfer fees might cost more than the 1% that Coinbase charges.  Most people who want to daytrade at Bitstamp buy bitcoins from Coinbase then send them to Bitstamp.
CampBX is in the US, but they only accepts checks by mail.  And their customer service sucks.

Even within the past year we've witnessed several disasters at MtGox.   
Their trading engine proved itself to be complete garbage, crashing at just the slightest bump in trading volume.  MtGox (with their ever-wise PR team) claimed to be the "victim of their own success."
Then their accounts were seized in the USA for not adhering to AML laws, causing fiat withdrawals to cease.   
And that's not to mention the countless customer service complaints posted here.  
Even without these warning signs though, why would anyone store bitcoins at any exchange?  One of the major advantage of Bitcoin is that you can store your own funds, with no counterparty risk.  MtGox has illustrated that advantage most clearly.

Anecdotal evidence is not evidence when trying to support a theory.  Especially when the actual evidence, Bitpay's huge sales volume, contradicts your postulate.

Two considerations:
1)  Most merchants accept bitcoins but choose receive dollars from the payment processor.  So you'd be offering a reverse service, accepting dollars via credit card but receiving bitcoins.  I expect currently there is a smaller market for such a service. (perhaps merchants in developing markets would be interested?)  But as Bitcoin becomes more popular, demand for such a service should increase.
2) Beware the potential for an increase in fraud.  If there's a way to convert credit cards to bitcoins, some assholes will look for a way to exploit it.

You don't need every transaction in the public ledger.  It's ok to trust 3rd parties sometimes.
For example if you used bitcoin to charge a bus pass.  You use the bus pass 50 times in a month.  That's 50 transactions, but only one transaction on the blockchain.  I see no problem with that. 
There are other advantages.  For example has a minimum tip of $0.25, because about half of that goes to miner fees just to send the tip.   An off-blockchain tipbot can tip any amount.

Like I said, even if you have the time to devote to it, you have to be able to have access to the hardware.  Perhaps you could get lucky and get your hands on some ASICs before going obsolete.  But the only sure way is to hire hardware engineers and build it yourself.  Hence, it is best suited for professionals, not amateurs.  
Fortunately mining is not a requirement to use Bitcoin, in the same way that you can still browse the web without being a guru of HTML and PHP.  That's how Bitcoin can still succeed.

Buying physical items isn't as big of a problem, since Paypal has your verified shipping address on file.   
Buying digital items, other than cryptocurrency, isn't as big of a problem either, since the DRM can later be revoked. (For example if you buy a Steam game with a stolen paypal account, Steam could simply delete the game from your account.)

Coinbase is not an exchange so they set their own prices.  They usually tend to track Bitstamp though.
MtGox is an exchange so traders set the price by making orders.  Their price is artificially high though, since they only process fiat withdrawals to Japan.  So if you have dollars at Gox, you have to buy bitcoins and withdraw those.

Yes, if physically shipping the bitcoins as a flash drive, paper wallet, Casacius coin, etc..   You can confirm that the item was shipped to the owner's home address.
If selling bitcoins online for Paypal, no.  You can verify that bitcoins were delivered to someone, but not necessarily to the account holder.  There is no way for Paypal to determine if the account holder purchased the bitcoins or if the Paypal account password was stolen and used by a thief.  Or for that matter the account holder could simply claim the account was stolen when it actually wasn't.

That in not a p2p decentralized network.  That is a client-server architecture, which must be administered by a centralized organization.  If Bitcoin were to become a centralized network, then it defeats the purpose of mining anyway, which is to achieve a consensus amongst untrusted network nodes, aka the [Byzantine Generals problem]( in computer science.

I wouldn't print it from a public printer.  Often those networked printers will cache all documents printed.  Somebody could later retrieve the document, thus your private key.


The potential security problem here is that even with the internet disconnected, a virus could steal your private key, then later transmit it as soon as you reconnect.  To solve that, use an Ubuntu live boot disc.  You boot from the read-only CD, interact with your wallet, then reboot when finished. I suggest running Electrum or perhaps using CarbonWallet.  Then you simply write down [12 words]( and there are no files to backup or paper wallets to print.

A payment processor.  They are used by merchants who want to quickly integrate bitcoin as a payment method into their checkout.  It even allows for merchants to directly receive dollars instead of bitcoins, if they chose.


Usually malware infected on the user's computer.  Or weak passwords.


The blockchain is a sequence of blocks.  Each block records all the transactions since the last block.  It is not hosted on servers, but propagated across a p2p network.   It can not crash or be easily taken offline.  It can fork, but that is another discussion.  (Blockchain.info is a website that lets you explore the blockchain, however the website itself is not the blockchain, just a third-party service.)


There is no minimum or maximum.  10 minutes is just the average time for the network to create a new block.  
If you are buying a cheeseburger, the merchant generally accepts it with 0 confirmations.  If you're transferring thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin, then the recipient may wish to wait for several confirmations.   
It's not likely to change soon, nor does it really need.  Faster blocks (confirmations) would mean less security per block, so you would just wind up needing more confirmations for the same level of confidence.

This would leaves the currency subject to corruption, theft, and political whims.  For example [E-Gold]( was a digital currency backed by gold. It failed whereas Bitcoin could succeed.

That's not really an advantage. Faster blocks and lower difficulty would mean waiting longer for the same level of security, because orphan blocks and blockchain forks would become more likely.
Otherwise Bitcoin would already be doing that.

GPU mining for bitcoins has pretty much been replaced with ASICs.  Unfortunately it is difficult to acquire an ASIC in a timely manner before becoming obsolete.
You could try mining altcoins if you really want to mine with a GPU. Altcoins themselves are rather pointless, but you could trade them for bitcoins.

There are various advantages, to both consumers and merchants.   
One consumer advantage is no bank account required, which may not mean much to you since you have one, but remember there are many people in the world who can not open a bank account.   
It would also be of benefit you as a consumer if you travel internationally, since many places in the world do not accept credit cards.
As a merchant, it can eliminate payment fraud, saving money.  It also costs less than credit card processing. That can help local businesses who are already operating on a thing profit margin.

Nobody is earning money "just from bitcoins", just like nobody is earning money "just from dollars".

It's not a problem because the transaction hash isn't usually used to track transactions.  Most wallet clients are going to compute a balance simply as the balance at that address according to the blockchain.

Dogecoin cloned Litecoin, which generates blocks faster than Bitcoin.  This is often touted as an advantage, but this claims falls apart when really considered.  Faster confirmation times simply means you need more confirmations for the same level of security.  Faster block generation is also more prone to orphan blocks and blockchain forks.  So it is actually a disadvantage.  If it were an advantage, Bitcoin would already have a shorter confirmation time.
Total number of coins is a psychological gimmick.  More important is the ratio of your coins to the total in existence, assuming limited supply. (Although if Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, that creates other inflationary concerns)
Transaction fees are lower in dogecoin, but that is only because it is newer.  If it were to become as successful, it would suffer the exact same scalability issues (actually worse since the block generation is faster, leading to more blockchain bloat.)

If they immediately convert it to local currency, then there should be no additional complications.

So many questions..
I'll try to get you started.


To put it as simply as possible: it's digital gold.  There is a limited supply and it isn't something of which banks can simply print more.


You must first understand the blockchain.  It's a data structure, a long list of blocks.   Each block records all the transactions that have occurred since the last block.   In this way the blockchain is the database that knows the balance of every bitcoin address.
Miners create the new blocks, and are rewarded with some bitcoins for their efforts.   This is how new bitcoins come into existence.   


Mining was once profitable for amateurs, but these days it is so competitive that only professionals can profit.


Yes, in most places in the world it is completely legal.   


You have a couple options.  You can download a local wallet program to run on your computer or phone.  I recommend Electrum and Mycellium.
Or you can chose a hosted online wallet.  I recommend trying Coinbase.
In the meantime, have 100 bits @_date: 2014-02-16 22:54:44

GBTC has supply limitations (one year wait to create new shares), so high demand drives the price higher than the price of actual bitcoins.
When COIN launches, they will be able to track the actual price of bitcoin, making it a more desirable investment than GBTC.   So people will sell their shares of GBTC to buy COIN, driving down the price of GBTC.

So a thief has your private keys.  He tries spending your coins.  You notice before 3 confirmations, and declare the coins stolen, reversing the transaction.  
Now you try to send the bitcoins to a new wallet.  The thief, who still has the private key, then declares the bitcoins stolen again and reverses your transaction.  
So who legitimately owns the bitcoins and who is the thief?  The decentralized bitcoin protocol has no way to determine.  It would require some authority to make a judgement.  
If you want to do have a third party decide when bitcoins can be spent, it is already possible. Just use a 2-of-3 transaction, where someone else (an escrow service, your banker, your lawyer, your wife, etc) holds part of your key.

You can take a transaction and mutate it so that it has a different hash value.  The transaction is still valid and could possibly be confirmed into a block instead of the original.  That by itself is not a problem.
MtGox uses transaction hashes to track user withdrawals (and thus balances) in their customer database.  If a customer can alter the hash of their withdrawal, it would look like the withdrawal was never confirmed. The customer contacts MtGox's customer service to request that the withdrawal be reissued.  The customer receives the bitcoin withdrawal twice.   MtGox is then missing bitcoins and their customer database left inaccurate.

GBTC is essentially an ETF.  An ETF allows a commodity such as gold or oil to be traded on a stock exchange as if it were a stock.  Read more about ETFs to get a better idea.


Retirement accounts can now easily invest in owning bitcoins.


Barry Silbert of Bitcoin Investment Trust


It isn't.  The price is currently higher.  1.0 share of GBTC equates to 0.1 bitcoin.
The reason? Supply and demand for GBTC is different than that for actual bitcoins.
Shares of GBTC are very limited in supply. And there is a 12 month delay to create new shares. But in the meantime, there is high demand for shares. Hence a rising price of GBTC.

BIT is open to only "acreddited investor", buying $25,000 worth at a time.  It is not freely traded.  They must hold BIT shares one year before they can be converted to GBTC shares to be freely traded.    Because of this delay, liquidity sucks.  There is much more demand than supply, causing the price to decouple from that of actual bitcoins.
COIN should have mechanism that allows new shares to be created to match demand.  The price should then track the actual price of Bitcoin.

You're missing my point about why that site's volume totals aren't comparable. 
But let's forget the numbers for a second and explore your original question.  Someone wants dogecoins, they have to first buy bitcoins, then trade them for dogecoins.  That creates upward pressure on the bitcoin/dollar price.  If the dogecoin seller now wants to sell his bitcoins for dollars instead of holding, that creates some downward pressure on the bitcoin/dollar price, but no more than the upward pressure caused by the original buyer.  So it would be a wash, no net change.

But you can still consider both aspects, currency and payment system, separately.

Already thousands of bitcoin transactions daily occur off the blockchain.   
For example tipping via ChangeTip.  Or every time a Coinbase user sends to another Coinbase user.
Yes, you are correct that the user does not directly control the private keys in that scenario.   But these are still transactions denominated in the currency of Bitcoin.
Paypal, Visa, and Alipay allow you to conduct transactions in USD, EUR, JPY, CNY, etc.   They could just as easily allow XBT accounts.   
So Bitcoin as a payment system doesn't have to defeat the legacy systems in every way for Bitcoin to succeed as a currency.  In fact, Bitcoin and other payment systems can actually complement one another.
(Edit: Also FYI, Counterparty is another currency that is already transacted via Bitcoin's blockchain. Although that's getting off topic.)

Go to Localbitcoins.com and search for cash deposit offers.  Select a seller with a good reputation.  It's usually pretty fast, but check the average response time of the seller.  Some are faster than others.
The seller will give you the name of the bank and an account number.  Deposit into that account number.  Take a photo of the receipt and upload it to Localbitcoins so the seller can see it.  The seller then releases bitcoins to you.

Hey and welcome!
Next step is probably to get yourself a wallet, to store and use your bitcoins. Coinbase is a good starter wallet if you're in the USA.   
Or if you just want to tip other people, you could leave your balance with Changetip.
These days mining is best left to professionals.  Most people just buy bitcoins, or get paid directly in bitcoin.   Coinbase will allow you to buy (or sell) bitcoins by transferring to and from your bank account.
Feel free to ask if you have any questions.
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:28:28
Good question.  Some commonly used denominations:
* 0.01 bits = 1 satoshi
* 1,000 bits = 1 mBTC

2. Japan prints money to make the yen worth less, so Americans will buy more junk from Japan.
3. Now that Japan is selling more junk to Americans, we're buying less from China.   So China prints more money to make their currency worth less.
4. Japan retaliates and prints more money.
5. Meanwhile the USA's economy is still floundering, meaning the fed will soon print more USD, restarting the entire cycle.

1. How is bitcoin controlled?
Bitcoin is controlled by a p2p network protocol.  It is similar to a democracy, because network nodes must agree on the validity of the blockchain.
 2. How do bitcoin transactions work? 
On a basic level, transaction are signed messages using public/private cryptography.  Signed transactions are recorded into the blocks which form the blockchain.  Since it records all the transactions, the blockchain can be compared to an accounting ledger. 
3. Since bitcoin doesn't have a central government controlling it, what risks/advantages does that mean?
The "risk" is that the value fluctuations.  However central governments are not  very good at controlling the value of their currency either.  Just look at Argentina and Venezuela in recent weeks.
The advantage is that no bank can inflate the currency by printing more.

You must first understand the blockchain as a series of sequential blocks.  Each block records transactions, the transfer from one address to another, that have occurred since the last block.
So if you were to analyze the blockchain, from block 0 (Aka the genesis block) to the current block, you could calculate the balance of each address as the sum of it's deposits and debits.   It's the same way you calculate the balance of your bank account, by adding up the deposits and subtracting the withdraws/debits/fees.
Blockchain.info is a website which is helpful to visualize the blockchain.  For example look at this address which was recorded in the last block:   You can easily see all the transactions that involve that address.  You can see in which block each was recorded, and how it affects the total balance.

Coinbase is a good place to start.  They will let you buy/sell bitcoins using your bank account.  They also provide a wallet service, which stores your bitcoins and allow you to send/receive to/from other wallets.

As long as you are the only one holding the private keys, nobody can access the bitcoins but you.   Multibit/Electrum/Armory all allow you to manage your own private keys.
Some online wallets hold the private keys for you.  If they were to shutdown, get hacked, go rogue, etc, they could take your bitcoins with them.  Or they could invent a policy that says if you're inactive they can keep your bitcoins.

It's called arbitrage, and it does happen, but it can be slower than you might think.  You have to consider the time to transfer fiat, which can take a week or more to transfer internationally.  
Lingering differences in price are often due the hassle and fees of transferring fiat to/from a particular exchange.  In other words, sending dollars to BTC-e from the USA in neither easy nor free.

For privacy reasons, you probably don't want to publicly publish an address, since anyone can view it, comprising not just your privacy but possibly the privacy of your clients.   Best practice is to use your wallet to generate a new receiving address for each transaction.


Best practice is to give a price quote in bitcoin, along with a time window in which to pay, for example 1 hour, 12 hours, 24 hours, or for however long you think you'd be comfortable with the price volatility.
I'd actually recommend just using Coinbase to send invoices.  You can just enter the client's email address along with the dollar amount you're requesting.  Coinbase will handle generating a new address, calculating instant exchange rate, specifying a time window, etc.

Do you not worry that Steam might delete your account (and game library) if a purchase is ever associated with a stolen credit card?   
@_date: 2015-07-18 18:25:34
Sure.   With a normal private key, whoever knows the key could spend the bitcoins.   Of course this wouldn't be ideal to leave with a family member, since they could easily spend it before you die.  Same problem with an attorney, who could steal your bitcoins if tempted.
Now consider a 2-of-3 key.  That means there are three pieces of the key, but you need only two of them to spend the bitcoins.   So give one piece to your wife.  Now give another to your attorney.  And keep one for yourself.  Now the bitcoins can only be spent if two of the three parties agree.

Gold makes a great commodity (impossible to counterfeit) but a poor currency (heavy and not easily divisible).  Because it makes a poor currency, bank notes representing gold were used.  While easy to carry, these notes can be counterfeited, and there is risk of corruption on the part of the bankers, printing more notes than their gold reserve should allow.
Bitcoin is different because it excels as both a commodity and a currency.

Be careful of it overheating.  Keep the laptop somewhere well ventilated and the keep fans free of dust.   CPU mining 24/7 really isn't worthwhile, even if electricity were free, just because of the extra wear you're putting on your laptop.  
Unfortunately it [looks like]( the Radeon HD 4330 doesn't support OpenCL, which is a prerequisite for GPU mining, so there isn't hope of much improvement on your laptop.

Bitcoin is designed to have a predictable rate of production. (Unlike dollars or euros that can be printed on whim by politicians and bankers.)   
The production rate is set high at first, but then gradually decreases until the maximum of 21 million has been produced.  Looking at [the graph]( you can see how the production rate starts out very steep, but then every four years becomes less steep, until it eventually forms a nearly flat line at the maximum of 21 million.
Why not just produce 50 per block until reaching 21 million maximum?  Because once production stops miners will only receive transaction fees.  So instead of a sudden stop in production, it is a more gradual adjustment, so that mining continues without such a jarring transition.

The easiest way if you live in the USA:
* Make an account at [MtGox](
* To [fund]( the account, select "cash deposit via Bitinstant"
* Select a branch location for Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, or Chase.
* Print the deposit slip.
* Go to the branch and give the teller the deposit slip along with the cash
* You will have funds at MtGox in about 30 minutes.
Then simply use MtGox to buy Bitcoins at market price.
Edit: Actually you can even remove MtGox from the solution by having [Bitinstant]( directly email you Bitcoins after depositing cash.

I don't think there is any particular problem with Deepbit, other than a desire for more decentralization.  With more smaller pools, when any one pool is down it affects less miners and the block generation continues at a more steady rate.

BitInstant's rates might not always be the best, but you continue to outdo yourself, both for convenience and quality of services offered.  Personally I think you do the community a great service by setting the bar so high.
On a side note, I do have a couple suggestions to improve the experience of your service for completely new users. When purchasing coins and choosing "Bitcoins by email", would  you consider changing the "destination account" field label to instead read something like "your email address" (or perhaps even combine that field with confirmation email).  
Also, the email received contains a raw API response from Coinapult containing a URL somewhere inside of it.  This, by itself, doesn't feel very n00b-friendly.  I suggest it include something more instructional, such as "Your purchase was successful.  To retrieve your coins click this link: _______ "

The distinction that really needs to be made is that Bitcoin transactions are irreversible.  This conflicts with most people understanding of how digital money functions.  If someone steals money from my bank account, it is no big deal, because I can simply call the bank who will then reverse the transaction.  Bitcoin by contrast requires a greater degree of personal responsibility.  Fortunately though, Bitcoin affords many storage options which are, in many ways, *more* secure than banks.

The easiest way to track is to simply watch the block count rise to 210000.
According to [bitcoincharts.com]( we're currently at 201665.  Blocks are added at an average speed of 10 minutes per block.
210000 - 201665 = 8335 blocks until reward halves.
8335 blocks * ~10 min/block = ~83350 minutes until reward halves
83350 min = ~58 days

A new site just launched called [Bitcoinary]( which matches individual buyers to individual sellers.  You could perhaps find someone there willing to sell bitcoins for paypal (which assumedly you could fund with a debit card).
But in general you will have a difficult time (or pay a premium) converting a 'soft' payment (credit cards/Paypal) into a 'hard' currency such as Bitcoin.  Because credit cards are reversible and Bitcoin is not, this creates high risk for sellers of bitcoins that a buyer will dispute a charge, allowing the buyer to keep both the bitcoins and dollars.  Bitcoinary works on a reputation system to try to mitigate such risks.

A new address would not have a privacy issue until some of the received coins are spent.  When creating a new send transaction, coins from multiple inputs might be combined to form the one output.  At that point the multiple input addresses would be linked in the new transaction.

I had thought Intersango accepted cash deposits, but I don't see it listed on their website.
One option is to meet someone in-person to trade. You could try: 
The software is pretty simple.  It will take several hours to sync the blockchain for the first use (you can observe the status in the lower right corner of the window).  Once completed you are free to send and receive.  To receive, go to the receive coins tab and copy an address.  Then give it to whomever is sending you coins.  Likewise sending simply requires someone to give you an address to which you will send coins.

Bitcoin donations can be accepted, but the campaign is responsible for collecting information from the donor.   (See [Mark Warden](
Collecting anonymous donations then forwarding the donation on behalf of someone else would likely be illegal though.  Although there is something analogous to that situation which does occur, wherein one person collects cash from individuals then gives the lump sum of the cash to the campaign.  There is a term for that style of fund raising, but I can't think of what it is.

Uhhh-ohh.  Sounds like you have deeper issues.  At this point, my recommendation is to try using the wallet.dat file in a new environment, either an entirely different computer or format your computer and reinstall Windows.   If you use a different computer, try to make sure it is free of malware (which could steal a wallet).   
As soon as you do get your wallet up and running, I recommend creating an account at [blockchain.info/wallet]( then sending your funds there.  It will be much easier to manage, and it still allows you to keep a backup of your wallet.

Yes, use a pool.  I recommend choosing one of the more popular ones listed [here](  (Although preferably not Deepbit, since we'd all like to see more decentralization in the mining.)  Personally I use Eligius.  


The official client can be found at Bitcoin.org.   Running a local client though, you should be aware of two things: 
1) Trojans infecting your computer can steal your wallet.  There is a feature that allows you to encrypt it to help protect against this.  Enable it. 
2)  Your funds are stored locally in a file called wallet.dat on your hard drive.  You need to make a backup of this in case of a hard drive crash.
See [here]( for more info.  It's not difficult, but if you aren't comfortable with those two things, try [blockchain.info's hosted wallet]( instead.


Ideally you trade the bitcoins directly to others for goods and services, never needing to convert back to fiat money.   But there are a number of services to help you exchange for fiat.  Based on your post history, looks like you live in Portugal.  So you probably want to find an exchange that supports SEPA bank transfers, such as [Intersango.co.uk]( or [BitcoinNordic](

Coinbase has some rudimentary fraud protection in that they first make two small deposits into your account which must be verified.   But then again, Dwolla uses the same mechanism and it clearly was insufficient in that case.  
They also limit deposits/withdraws to $100 at this time.   
Beyond that though, I have no clue.  They probably don't want to reveal too much about their fraud detection techniques, because it could assist potential fraudsters.

The Spanish state received a bailout, so that it can now bailout Spanish banks.  This is supposed to assure citizens that their deposits are safe. Since there is no deposit insurance for euro banks, capital has been fleeing Spain at unprecedented rates for the past several week.  After the bailout capital is still fleeing and rates on state bonds are still rising.  The only real effect of the bailout is that it shifted private debt to sovereign state debt.  And possibly bought Germany some time for whatever their meister plan is.
Without the bailout though, Spain would not have immediately defaulted.  They could have chosen to let their banks fail.  But that would hit an already weakened economy so hard that a state default would then be unavoidable.

Yes, limited space per block means the market will determine the going rate for fees.  If the rate becomes prohibitively high, some transactions might start occurring through third party services that don't place every transaction on the blockchain.  For example, the [tipbot]( service currently uses the blockchain for every transaction.  But the tipbot could instead start tracking user balances internally, and use the blockchain only for funds that are deposited and withdrawn from the service.

Protocol already defines a maximum size for each block.  If 'spam' truly is an issue, the maximum block size should be lowered, so then transaction can compete with one another on the basis of fees to determine what is and isn't spam.
I don't think we should fault a service for using the blockchain as defined by the rules of protocol.  If anything, we should thank them for providing a stress test.

I wouldn't recommend mining coins unless you have cheap electricity and are seeking a new technical hobby. 
The easiest way to acquire some coins is to use BitInstant.  You initiate the purchase at Bitinstant.com, then pay cash at a CVS, Walmart, 7-11, etc.  You can choose to have Bitinstant award you credit at an exchange such as MtGox, or simply deliver coins via email.   
Once you have purchased your coins, you'll want to store them in either the official wallet client available at bitcoin.org, or a web-hosted wallet service such as blockchain.info.
What to do with your coins? You could:
- Trade for some Diablo or Warcraft items at Ogrr.com.
- Bid on some items at bitmit.net or the just-launched coinpost.com.
- Download mp3 files or ebooks from coindl.com.
- Donate to Wikileaks.
- Tip some ladies over in - See what is available in - Buy some gold at coinabul.com
- Gamble at satoshidice.com, strikesapphire.com, or sealswithclubs.eu
- Save them until they are worth millions of dollars some day :-P
There is a good list [here]( of places to spend coins.
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible and anonymous, so there do tend to be some unsavory characters out there who would steal.  Use common sense and look into reputations.  Check back here with the community if you're unsure about any particular merchant.
@_date: 2012-07-18 14:16:41
Your best bet is to deposit cash. 
BitInstant allows deposits at major bank branches as well as retails shops such as CVS, Walmart, and 7-11.   
But for the lowest possible fee, use BitFloor to deposit cash at a Chase bank branch (assuming there is one in your state).

The answer will depend in which country you live.
In the USA, no it is generally not accepted by exchanges, because banks will reverse ACH transactions at the request of customers.  (wire transfers are treated differently, but cost relatively hefty fees)
In Europe, the banking situation is apparently different, as most every exchange does accept SEPA transfers.

Each transaction can have multiple inputs, as well as multiple outputs (in case you wanted to pay several people at once).
Also the .005 fee is only suggested.  It's really more of a free market, with each transaction competing on price to be included in a block.  As jereguismi said, most zero-fee transactions still get included, as long as space permits.  Paying a fee though ensures miners will give priority to your transaction over those with no fees.

Sometimes when producing a transaction, multiple inputs are combined to one output.  For example you have a wallet with 10BTC (that you purchased from MtGox) sitting in one address and 5BTC (earned from mining) sitting in another address.  You then send a payment of 12BTC to some address.  Suddenly your MtGox activity and your mining activity are correlated, because both inputs were used to produce the transaction of 12BTC.

A wallet is composed of public/private encryption key pairs.  That is what is actually printed on the coin.  The public key is printed on the exterior and can be used to check the balance.  The private key is on the interior side and is used to transfer the balance.
Many clients and services support manually importing a private key, not only MtGox.  So you aren't dependent on any particular service.

[Coinbase]( is the easiest and cheapest option, via your bank account.  [Bitinstant]( is fastest, via cash at retail locations. 
[Casascius]( physical coins are more expensive but are more fun to give as a present.  Although he accepts only bitcoin as payment, so you would still need to first purchase bitcoins elsewhere.

* Fees: You would be paying a fee to purchase the card. Then every merchant that accepts the card must also pay a fee of at least 3%.
* Limited geography:  Prepaid cards are often only valid in the country of origin.
* Counterparty risk: The card could be deactivated at Visa/Amex's discretion. This is especially problematic if you bartered for the card, because the seller could later report it lost/stolen and the issuer would give them a replacement.

No minimum.  Buy as much or as little as you want.  Bitcoin itself has no such rules. (Exchanges could set their own rules though)


The question doesn't quite make sense.  Bitcoin is analogous to a currency, not a stock.   There are stocks on the [GLBSE]( that are traded with bitcoins.  AFAIK though, there are no mutual funds offered there yet.  
Edit:  Other responders indicate there are already mutual funds available on GLBSE.


Every exchange sets their own commission fees.  For example, [CampBX]( charges 0.55%.


I've been using CampBX, but I'm going to try [BitFloor.com](  Recently I've been hearing good things about them, plus they allow cash deposits at Chase bank branches.

Mining still costs energy, but it should be offset slightly by a slightly lower heating bill in winter.   Whereas in summer, mining produces heat which much then be cooled by A/C, producing an even high electric bill than the energy consumption of the GPU itself.

It will depend on the browser's configuration.  The local wallet client should launch if installed and configured properly.

If you need a gaming card anyway, might as well consider one that can mine as well.  Take a look [here](

Nobody knows exactly.   Basic supply and demand would predict a rise in price.  But since everyone knows it will happen, perhaps the price rises before the drop, and then stays flat during the drop, or perhaps even the price falls because speculators could then be disappointed.

If any Bitcoiner finds themselves severely emotionally distraut during a crash, unfortunately that is not the ideal time to turn to this subreddit for support.  Real posts would be likely to go unnoticed among all the troll posts.   My advice would be to go take a walk and talk to friends/family.

Personally I'd like to see more media coverage such as [this CNN video clip](  Last summer when introducing my brother to Bitcoin, his first question was, "Where can I spend it in the real world?  Can I go eat dinner with it?"   And I was able to show him that clip, broadcast only a few days prior, of customers ordering food at Meze Grille.
Since then Meze Grille no longer accepts Bitcoins, but I know there are at least [a few other locations]( around the globe accepting coins.   
I propose some user-created coverage, highlighting these businesses and their choice to use Bitcoin. 
Anyone in Orlando want to go to Whiskey Dicks and show us your experience?
Someone in St Louis should buy something from Grubgo and let us know how convenient (or not) it really is.
Chicago, how is that Pi's Pizza?  How is accepting Bitcoins working out for them?

As someone else mentioned, [Bit-Pay]( might have the ideal solution for this.   They'll automatically convert the BTC received into USD at the time of sale.

Re: voting mechanism
Bitcoin is by its nature democratic.  If miners deviate from the protocol, their blocks will be rejected by clients and other miners observing proper protocol.  By this method, the proper protocol is determined to be whatever the majority observes it to be.
But there also exists an added layer of organized democracy: [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals](  If there is unsettled debate over implementation of a proposal, a vote can be put before miners, as was recently the case with [BIP 16 vs. 17](  Whenever a new block was created the miner could choose to embed a vote for either BIP16 or 17.

Correct.  The wallet.dat file contains the public/private key pairs which constitute your bitcoin funds.   (If unencrypted and someone else gets a copy that file, they can control your funds, so store it some place secure)
- Shutdown the Bitcoin-QT client if already running. 
- Delete everything in the data directory except for wallet.dat.  (a good time to backup while you're there and the client is shutdown)
- Start the Bitcoin-QT client.
- It will then redownload the blockchain (which will likely take several hours)
- Once the blockchain is up to date, you should see your correct balance displayed.
No need to apologize.  Bitcoin is so new that we're all n00bs to some extent. :-)

Consider if the protocol were to change significantly enough to require an updated client to recognize new blocks, and a minority of clients refused the update, but the majority approved and updated.  The minority would find themselves with a likely useless forked blockchain, until they conformed to the new protocol version already adopted by the majority. So by updating the majority approves the new version of protocol.  Likewise if a majority refused to update, wouldn't they then be voting against the change in protocol?

Most people have little understanding of the mechanics of money, and have certainly never witnessed the emergence of a completely new form of money.  To truly understand Bitcoin, one needs some background knowledge in computer science, economics, history, political philosophy, etc.
So when unable to comprehend something newly encountered, the human brain tends to mold the facts to fit something that it does understand.  In this case, people see other becoming rich, and cognitive dissonance tells them it is a Ponzi scheme, which is more readily comprehensible to these people.

Technically you could import your private keys into Electrum, but it is a bad idea for two reasons. Firstly it is a pain in the butt.  Secondly, a large advantage of Electrum is the deterministic wallet, a feature you'd be skipping by importing private keys manually.
So just send to an address in your new Electrum wallet.  Make sure you write down the 12-word seed in multiple places.  This serves as the backup for your new deterministic wallet.

The argument was made above that no one will use GBTC because there are now easier ways to buy bitcoins, with which I disagree because it ignores the benefits for retirement investors.
If you're arguing that no one will use GBTC because one could already hold bitcoins in a self-directed retirement account, I must also disagree.  The accounting alone makes a self-directed account very unappealing.   And my employers contributes directly to an IRA account.  Could I manually move funds around every pay check to make it happen?  Possibly, but I expect it would be a pain in the ass.

1) I don't recommend using it as a wallet for several reasons.  One of which: you must maintain regular backups of your wallet.dat file.   Whereas a determinstic wallet such as Electrum or Mycelium requires only that you write down 12 words.  Edit:  If you do want to use your full node as a wallet, perhaps you should look at Armory.  It is a more full-featured wallet that operates using your local node.
2) No concerns there.

Your best option would be to get a hardware wallet.
Next best option would be to use a wallet app such as Mycellium.  It will give you a 12-word seed phrase which you can use to restore your wallet in case you lose your phone.  (The seed phrase is actually your private keys.)  But you would run the risk of malware potentially stealing your bitcoins.  It's probably not a big risk though unless you download shady apps to your phone, or keep large balances in your wallet.

The 12-word mnemonic seed ("passphrase") is the easiest and most secure backup option for most people.  For a desktop wallet with this feature, I highly recommend Electrum.  But I don't think the same seeds are interchangeable with Hive.
Edit: Using a mnemonic seed is a "local bitcoin account".  That seed generates your private keys (the critical part of a wallet).  So with that phrase you (or anyone else who knows it) can generate a copy of your wallet.

You could never find any significant support for such a change in protocol.   
If you invalidate Satoshi's coins today, which coins will you invalidate tomorrow?    
That won't be the blockchain I'll be using.
Edit:  Also, you'd have a practical problem of proving which coins belong to Satoshi.  Unless some evidence or analysis exists of which I'm not aware, we are only assuming that Satoshi has a massive hoard of coins.  Sure, Satoshi was the first miner, but we don't know exactly when others joined, or exactly who mined which blocks.

The yellow line is some sort of price average.  The green extending above the line and the red below are local highs and lows.  
In the bottom section, the green represents the volume of sell orders on the books and the red represents volume of buy orders.  The steeper the volume of buy/sell orders, the more difficult to move the price in that direction.   So for the price to be trending up, you want to see steep buy wall (green), and a gradual sell wall (red), indictating more eager buyers than sellers.

The app is titled "Circle for Bitcoin".  Unless you're implying that this isn't using bitcoins because the users don't personally hold the private keys, in which case I must respectfully disagree.  
This is the path to mainstream adoption.  We can't realistically expect that every user is capable of our standard of personal computer security.  Most users will always need someone else to hold their hand, a burden which I think Circle and Coinbase are accomplishing most gracefully.

I don't think Bitcoin could be a drop-in replacement for WoW in-game currency.  For example, Blizzard needs to be able to generate gold every time you kill an orc.  Distributing bits instead could prove costly for Blizzard if they don't totally understand all the economic factors.   
With Diablo III, Blizzard experimented with a "real money" auction house, allowing deposits and withdrawals via Paypal I believe.  They eventually dropped the feature.
I do see a future for Bitcoins as an in-game currency, but I think it will evolve more organically. 
I think first bitcoin will see success as a meta-currency for virtual worlds.  Use the in-game gold in WoW, but when you want to transfer wealth to a different game, trade for bitcoin.

What your talking about is measuring in mBTC or μBCT.   (Which is a great idea too, but you can already start doing this now.)
I'm talking about scaling as in how many people can use bitcoin daily to send transactions.
Currently each block is limited to 1 megabyte.   That means we can only fit a limited number of transactions per block on the blockchain.   This limits how many transaction can be conducted per hour on the Bitcoin blockchain.  
Miners now pick the transactions with the highest fees to include in blocks, so in effect if a user wants a fast transaction, they must pay higher and higher fees.
This limits Bitcoin's use to only sending transactions of large value.  It's no longer useful for small transactions such as paying at a café.
There are a number of proposed solutions and improvements: bigger block sizes, segwit, lightning network, etc.  Each have their own pros and cons.  
But so far miners seem hostile to all proposed solutions, fearing a short-term loss of profit from transaction fees.   Thinking ahead though, more growth and more transactions per hour should mean much more profit for them.
@_date: 2016-05-08 11:33:02

Bitwage offers services to employees, not employers.  You receive an ABA routing and account number, which you then give your employer for use with direct deposit of paychecks, as if it were just a normal bank account.   This requires no extra effort of the employer.  In fact, the employer doesn't even realize that the employee is receiving bitcoins.

I think you answered your own question.  Bitcoin will be considered a mainstream success when most people using it don't even realize so.
For example Circle is already trying to hide the technical aspects behind a curtain.   Circle's front page doesn't even mention Bitcoin until you scroll to the bottom.
Edit:  Another example is Linux.  Once relegated to nerds and academics, it now dominates servers and even runs every Android phone.   Ask a "droid" or "samsung" owner if they're familiar with Linux then they'll surely respond no.  Yet they use it daily without realizing so.

Generally the premium price you pay is because you are paying someone else to buy from an exchange then sell to you.   Most people would not be willing to go to the trouble of doing that if not motivated by a profit.
That particular price sounds outrageous, but the seller is probably just hoping for a naive/desperate buyer to come along.  If that really is the going local rate where you live, I'd suggest you consider selling on Localbitcoins.

Backing up is separate concern.  (For that, I recommend Mycellium for mobile or Electrum for desktops.  They use a [mnemonic seed]( basically just 12 words you can write down or memorize.)

More likely what could happen would be a blockchain fork, during which the coins could be spent on both forks.  Of course only one fork would emerge as the main fork, but in the meanwhile two merchants may think they hold the same coins.  That's why for very large amounts you want several confirmations, to ensure that the transaction really is included in the main blockchain.


I think that's how payment processors such as Bitpay are able to guarantee transactions with 0 confirmations.

Electrum is a great wallet, congratulations.  Forget all about mining though.  It is best left to the professionals.  Instead, focus on some other ways of obtaining some bitcoins.  A few ideas:
* Buy some from an exchange or service such as [Coinbase]( or with cash by arranging to meet someone on [LocalBitcoins]( 
* Clean out your closet/garage, and sell items on [Coingig]( an eBay-like site using bitcoins, or on * Apply for jobs on or [Coinality](
* Rent your house/appartment or just a room on [9Flats]( and get paid in bitcoins
* Sell some MMORPG items on [Ogrr]( a trading forum for gamers using bitcoins
* Perform some easy, but low-paying tasks on [CoinWorker]( a site similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk for bitcoins
* Become a local seller on [LocalBitcoins]( especially if no one else in your area is already doing so.  Charge a commission.

You probably want to total the order at your register as a cash transaction.  Then create a new order using Bitpay.  Customer pays the specified amount to the specified address generated by bitpay.  You record the order number and amount somewhere at the register, so at the end of the night your cash + bitpay payments should add up to the total daily sales amount.  (Edit: or Bitpay can probably provide you with a daily report which might simplify this) The restaurant later receives dollars in their bank account deposited by Bitpay.

Well the first problem is verifying that the person using the service is actually the cardholder.


The credit card company will neither understand nor care.  They will just see a high number of chargebacks then cancel your merchant account because it isn't worth the headache.  
Even if you had a special relationship with the credit card company, the best identity verification, fraud prevention, AML compliance, etc, all of that would be quite costly.  Add to that the high percentage fee credit cards already charge merchants, and the fraud you'd be paying for out of pocket, then this service is going to be very expensive.

I believe Bitcoin-QT pre-generates 100 addresses at a time.  So you do occasionally need to create a new backup, but not necessarily after every transaction.  
Consider using Electrum instead.  It gives you a [mnemonic seed]( used to generate every address of the wallet.  It greatly simplifies the backup process.  Just write down the words.

Butterfly Labs.  They sold huge numbers of ASIC mining hardware then never shipped to customers.  Paypal wound up refunding many customers since BFL refused refunds on unshipped products.
This has nothing to do with OP, other than Paypal perhaps deciding to ban all ASIC sellers, even resellers.
@_date: 2013-03-01 22:26:51
Yes but if the block size is approaching the limit, there is limited space to include transactions.  So you either include transactions below market rate, making yourself less profitable than the average miner.  Or you charge your customers even higher than market-rate fees, meaning no one would use the service, because they would just include the standard market-rate fee and get the transaction included by any miner.
What baffles me is why there are unconfirmed transactions right now.  Since we aren't hitting the size limit yet, miners have no reason not to include every transaction that has any fee attached.

If you have dual GPUs, they may appear to be two different OpenCL devices.  So you'd need to run two instances of the miner, with each configured to use a different device.

I sent a small amount of bitcoin to you via Reddit.  Unfortunately the tipbot is currently offline though.  Remind me tomorrow and I'll try again.


No, we'll just continue to use the bitcoins in circulation.  Because of that divisibility, we'll probably be using smaller and smaller units as time passes.  This is opposite to typical currencies, which become less valuable over time and larger units are required.  (Think about how a dime to your grandfather was worth about as much as a dollar would be now.  Bitcoin works opposite of this.)
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:02:48

Right, either the transaction is valid or not, and everyone can easily verify that.

You can't withdraw anything from Gox except bitcoins.  You might could still send dollars there to make a purchase, but the price is higher than every other exchange anyway, so you'd be a fool to do so.

Really neither is GPU mining either.  You'll spend more on electricity than you'll ever generate..  If you want to try anyway, you may need the AMD APP SDK to add OpenCL support.  If that doesn't work, your GPU may not even support OpenCL.

Let's start with the blockchain, basically a sequential list of blocks. Within each block are records all of the transactions that have occurred since the last block was created. So if you were to look at each block in the blockchain, from the genesis block to the current block, you could calculate the balance of every address.
When you send some bitcoins to another address, it creates a transaction that gets recorded into a new block on the blockchain. As everybody else on the p2p network sees this new block, they are now able to calculate the new balance of your address as well as the new balance of the address where you sent the coins.  Any fees that were optionally included in that transaction are retained by the miner (or pool of miners) who successfully created that block. The fee could be thought of as a tip for fast inclusion in a block.
Let me know if anything is still unclear.
Edit:  


Miners can elect to include or exclude any transaction when creating a block, hence the free market aspect I mentioned.  Right now most zero-fee transactions are included in blocks.  But when space becomes cramped, the tx fee will rise simply as an effect of supply vs. demand.  Unless we revise the protocol to increase the block size, which is eventually likely, but probably far out.

The most relevant price is the one you would actually be using if you were to buy/sell.  As a Candian, you would probably be using Cavirtex, so you should probably use that as your reference price.
The prices vary for a number of reasons, but one of the most important factors is how easy/cheap it is to move fiat to and and from an exchange.  If fiat flows easy/cheap/fast between two exchanges then arbitrage tends to balance the prices.

Because it is difficult to withdraw fiat money from MtGox in Japan.  This causes a situation where there are more buyers than sellers at MtGox right now.   


MtGox is not a buyer or seller of bitcoins, it is only a tool, a trading platform for individuals to buy and sell to one another.  Individuals define the price at which they will buy or sell, and MtGox matches the orders.
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:45:36

Well, you could use Windows offline, but it would defeat the purpose.  Windows could be infected with bitcoin-stealing viruses.  If you were to generate a wallet offline on a Windows machine, a virus could see the wallet, record it to disk, then later steal it later when Windows is again online.
An Ubuntu boot CD solves this because the disc is read-only, meaning the wallet *can't* be stored.  Also an Ubuntu CD is almost certainly not going to have virus as a Windows machine likely does.

Last I read, CampBX's ACH deposit isn't planned to be available until Nov 20.  Until then you have to mail them a check or money order.  Otherwise they are good exchange unless you need timely customer service.  Hopefully they'll work to improve that area.
Coinbase is the most popular option in the USA right now.  (although they don't have some of the advanced trading features of a full exchange such as CampBX) They charge 1%, and a $0.15 ACH fee.  
Usually CampBX is significantly cheaper than Coinbase.  I expect that will even out once CampBX enable ACH deposits.

Coinbase (in the US) deposits and withdraws from your checking account (like how paypal works). 
Neither Amazon, ebay, nor Steam directly accept bitcoins yet.  Hopefully they will eventually.  But in the meantime, there are other services which help.

On eBay, it is up to individual sellers to determine their payment methods.  Most use only Paypal, but it couldn't hurt to ask the seller if they would consider accepting bitcoins instead.

The blockchain is a sequential list of blocks.   Within each block are records all of the transactions that have occurred since the last block was created.   So if you were to look at each block in the blockchain, from the genesis block to the current block, you could calculate the balance of every address.
When you send some bitcoins to another address, it creates a transaction that gets recorded into a new block on the blockchain.  As everybody else on the p2p network sees this new block, they now know the new balance of your address as well as the new balance of the address where you sent the coins.
Does this make any more sense?

Colored coins are bitcoins used to represent something other than just bitcoin (bitcoin the currency).
Imagine painting some pennies as red, some as blue, and some as white, then using them as poker chips or Monopoly game money.  They are still pennies, but can have other value as well in the appropriate context.
Counterparty (a protocol running on the Bitcoin blockchain) implements colored coins as something they call Counterparty tokens.   Anybody can issue tokens,which can be used to represent everything from real estate titles to stock certificates to collectible trading cards.  The tockens can be transferred to any bitcoin address.  So it's like a digital object with the tradable properties of bitcoin, but with a value representing something else.

You say that, but did you ever stop to question why silver was useful alongside gold in a bi-metallic monetary system?   Gold has practical limits to its divisibility.  Nobody wants to shave off flakes of a gold coin to make change for a small purchase.  So silver coins were useful for smaller denominations.   
Bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal places, meaning it has no issues making change.  It does not need an inferior want-to-be coin.

I just meant that might explain why Coinbase and MtGox's prices would be temporarily inline.
I think Coinbase usually gets their supply from Bitstamp, which is why the Coinbase price usually tends to track the Bitstamp price.   But if Bitstamp is unavailable, maybe Coinbase is temporarily using MtGox for supply, thus basing the Coinbase price on MtGox.


Mostly Coinbase these days.   But I might switch back to CampBX once they implement ACH bank deposits/withdrawals.

I would say the primary purpose of the difficulty adjustment is not to prevent inflation, but to keep the block generation rate steady. This helps make transaction processing time predictable.  Also this keeps the blockchain size growing linearly, rather than exponentially.

1)  Those addresses correspond to the 12-word phrase.  You can't change them without regenerating that phrase.  However additional addresses will be generated as needed.
2)  When you go to spend bitcoins, you will be given an address of the recipient.  Use electrum to send coins to the specified address.
3)  Yes, Electrum makes it easy to use on multiple PCs, because that 12-word seed means your wallets will be kept in sync automatically.
4)  You won't be able to access your Electrum wallet from your iPhone.  You'll probably want to make a web wallet to keep a small day-to-day balance on your phone.  Blockchain.info/wallet can be used via Safari (and perhaps has an app).  I know Coinbase has a new iPhone app.  Also, Gliph is worth checking out.  It is a securing messaging app with bitcoin integration.
5)  Using any wallet is only as secure as your PC.  So if you are prone to virus infections, consider using a separate, secured, computing environment for bitcoin transactions.  If you're familiar with Ubuntu, it is more secure than Windows, and runs Electrum well.

That label section of the client is only viewable to you, not stored in the block chain or sent to the receiver.  (Although inserting signed messages into blocks is possible, it is not commonly done. Perhaps one day that will be a feature though.)

If the merchant converts bitcoin payments into dollars or local currency immediately, there are no risks whatsoever.  Payment processors such as [Bitpay]( [BIPS]( [BitPagos]( etc. can do this automatically.  Customers pay bitcoins, but the merchant gets dollars in their bank account just like normal.  
If the merchant decides to receive some or all payments in bitcoins, there are some additional concerns.  There is risk of exchange volatility (the price could go down while holding).  Also the accounting department might get a headache trying to balance books in both dollars and bitcoins.  It can be done, but old dogs and new tricks, ya know...
Edit:  One thing that small companies should consider when accepting bitcoins, many consumers will demand use of an escrow service until the company has established a sufficient reputation.  Since bitcoin transactions are irreversible, consumers feel more confident with some form of buyer protection, which escrow provides.

Absolutely do not buy a mining rig.  You will almost certainly lose money. Bitcoin mining is best left to the professionals.
I'd encourage you to seek other ways to support Bitcoin, such as offering to accept it for your products/services.  
Actually converting from bitcoin to fiat is extremely easy.  Typically businesses use a payment processor such as Bitpay or Coinbase.  They can automatically convert your payments to dollars, then automatically deposit into your bank account.   This also removes any risk of exposure to price volatility, since your company never even has to touch the bitcoins.   
As for being taken seriously, more and more companies accept bitcoins every day.  Reddit, for example accepts bitcoins for Reddit Gold subscriptions.

I think of online wallets like a wallet you would keep in your pocket.  You don't want to keep too much cash in it, in case it gets stolen or lost.   Cold storage (offline) is more like a safe, which is less convenient but more secure.

Yes, it allows them to comply with "know your customer" banking laws.  It also helps them prevent bank fraud.


Coinbase keeps the majority of their funds in cold storage, ie on a flash drive in a safety deposit box at a bank.  So even if they were hacked, only a small amount could be stolen.

Exactly.  Buy from Coinjar then transfer to a more long-term storage.  Please don't run Multibit (or any other wallet client) on a computer likely to have computer viruses, since these can steal your bitcoins.
The delays are usually due to the legacy banking system, which takes days to securely transfer money between banks.
More instantaneous ways of moving dollars, such as Paypal and credit cards, don't mix well with bitcoin trades.  The problem is scammers, who would steal dollars then trade to bitcoins.  Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which make them highly desired by such thieves.

The most important advice is to back up your wallet, preferably including paper printouts of the private keys.
Since you're in the USA, you may want to consider [Coinbase]( which allows you to transfer to and from your bank account (although they've been experiencing some growing pains and have been out of stock lately).  
Another popular option is [BitFloor]( which allows cash deposits at Bank of America locations.

If you're talking about a significant amount, you may consider a wire transfer directly to MtGox.

Those who have access to new equipment first are the most successful.  But without a degree in electrical engineering to create your own ASIC, you don't stand much chance.


The Bitcoin network will continue fine, whether at 1MH/s or 5000TH/s.


The point of mining isn't supposed to be profit.  The purpose is to process transactions in a decentralized way.  The trend will be for it to become less profitable over time, until it reaches some equilibrium where miners are just barely breaking even.


Personally I'm not a fan of the alternative cryptocurrencies.  They all just ripoff the idea of Bitcoin without any improvements.  Some are even outright scams.


Actually using a credit card is one of the most difficult ways to try to obtain Bitcoins.  (Credit cards are reversible while Bitcoin is not, so credit card fraud is prevalent.) 
Do you have access to a bank account?   If not, cash might be your best option.  You can find people on  to meet and trade cash.  Other options might be selling items on  (like ebay).  Or trading virtual gaming items on

Unless you could somehow predict the market, the best strategy is dollar-cost averaging.  Buy small amounts spread out over time.

Don't store your coins at the exchange though.  A simple recommendation on storage is to get a wallet from [blockchain.info/wallet]( then print a paper wallet to store as a backup.

Yeah, Electrum randomly generates the 12 words for you.  If you don't trust it to be sufficiently random, you could still use a dice to come up with your own 12 words then restore an Electrum wallet from that.  


I boot the disc then allow it to connect to the Internet to download Electrum.  If you're paranoid about this part, you could unplug it again before actually generating the wallet.


Sounds right, although the method I use requires no flash drive anyway.

If you're old enough to remember, think about how credit card POS has evolved over the years.  Originally merchants had to manually process every transaction.  Then the first electronic CC processors were clunky and slow.  They had modems and had to make a phone call to authorize every transaction, taking about 30 seconds, assuming it wasn't down.  Now every CC transaction is almost seamless, just swipe and go.
In regard to wallet security, I recommend using different wallets for different purposes.  Cold storage such as a paper wallet or Electrum's [12 word]( seed can be thought of as a safe in your house.   Online wallets or phone wallets can be thought of as a pocket wallet.  You wouldn't want to put more in your pocket wallet than you could afford to lose if you were mugged or you left it in a cab.  You would just carry enough cash for a couple days of spending, then refill from your safe occasionally.

A  good time to buy?   Nobody can really say, but that's another good argument for making multiple smaller investments.  Then you "dollar cost average" your investment, getting an average price over a period of time.
A paper wallet is a private encryption key, printed on paper.  There is no password to it.  Anyone who sees it could steal your funds.  When you go to use it, you'll import it into a wallet, whether Coinbase or elsewhere.  
(I've heard that the industrial-size printer/copiers have hard drives which permanently store every print, so if you're paranoid, use a home printer.)

Digital items can be revoked via DRM, such as games on Steam.  And even if not, the retailer looses nothing except a potential sale.

It's not a circuit breaker, they've simply extinguished their pool of credit for the day.
Usually Coinbase will allow you to lock-in the price of the bitcoins while the funds are taken from your account. To do this though, they are buying bitcoins for you and holding them until your dollars are transfered, ie. basically extending credit so you can get today's price.
But they have a limited pool of credit. So when their pool of credit is extinguished on busy days, the only option they have to offer you is to buy coins for you when your dollars actually arrive.

Once the size of blocks start reaching the maximum size limit, transactions will start competing on fees for inclusion into a block.  So in this sense, the free market will determine the cost of a transaction.  And blockchain spam will become prohibitively costly.
There is a possibility the protocol could be updated to increase the 1MB per block limit, although there likely will still be some limit set.
Also consider not every transaction needs to go on the blockchain.  For example the tip bot currently uses the blockchain for every tip.  It could be modified so that tipping occurs internally to the system, with the blockchain only used for deposits and withdraws.

Yes, you can simply accept payments into your personal wallet. 
Payment processors such as BIPS.me and Bitpay help merchants by automating the invoicing and payment process, automatically selling bitcoins and depositing local currency into the merchant's bank account.  I'm not sure if either of these services yet support deposits into Brazilian bank accounts though.

If they have your public address, they can send coins to you as well as being able to view the transactions associated with that address. (all transactions are public in the blockchain).

You're proposing that mining vanity addresses would provide economic disincentive to prevent squatting domain names.   But Namecoin already has an economic disincentive for deterring squatting: spending namecoins that were mined.  (If it is not effective, perhaps the fee is too low.)
Were you proposing that renewals and transfers not occur?  If so, that will be problematic.  Once a domain has been registered, there is some expectation that it will remain so.  Can you imagine the problems if google.com had no way to renew their domain every 12 months?   
If you are planning to allow renewals and transfers, you need to consider the mechanism.
Also, it still needs a decentralized datastore for DNS entries. If you're planning on storing them as messages in Bitcoin's blockchain, that will probably create bloat and eventually become prohibitively costly.  The cost of changing your IP address would go up over time along with Bitcoin transaction fees.  That's why Namecoin has its own blockchain, for that purpose.
I suspect once the necessary features have been added, it will be about as complex as Namecoin already is.  I say keep exploring the idea though.

But even if they were, the problem is getting ASIC hardware in a timely manner.  By the time anyone can get mining hardware, it is already obsolete and can never pay for itself.  
Only the professional miners are profitable, probably because they have inside connections with manufacturers.
You'd be much better off simply buying bitcoins.

IMO, the best timing strategy is dollar-cost averaging.  Spread your purchases out over time, so that you get an average price.


This depends on many factors such as where you live and how many you want to purchase.  If in the USA, consider CampBX which accepts checks by mail, BitFloor which allows cash deposits at Bank of America, and CoinBase which allow bank transfers (although they've been frequently out of stock lately).  If you want a serious amount, consider a wire transfer to MtGox.


You'll store your coins in a "wallet".  I recommend blockchain.info/wallet because they allow you to backup your wallet, including [paper printouts](

Electrum is a lite client, meaning it doesn't store the whole blockchain like a full p2p client would such as Bitcoin-QT.  Instead it connects to servers to access the blockchain.  This makes it load much faster.  And it can still be considered decentralized since anyone can run a server.

"Mining" produces the blockchain, the data-structure implementing the structural backbone of Bitcoin.  Essentially it is a public ledger logging all transactions.  Having a decentralized network of miners maintaining the blockchain also provides security.  As an incentive, newly minted coins are distributed to miners, currently at a rate of 25BTC/hour, but this distribution rate halves every four years.

Your safest timing strategy is probably dollar-cost averaging. Break your large purchase up into smaller purchases spread over a period of time, so that you are purchasing for the average price.

Coinbase manages all of their private keys internally.   So if you look at a Coinbase deposit address in blockchain.info, you shouldn't expect to see your Coinbase balance.


You can't.  That's why if you're paranoid you should use a wallet where you retain control of the private keys.  As a simple solution use Coinbase to export to a paper wallet:

There's a trade off between security and ease of use.  For short-term use, something easily accessible like blockchain.info/wallet or Coinbase works well enough. For long-term storage, you might want to consider something like a paper wallet.  Electrum is pretty cool too, since it makes backups very easy by simply writing down [12 words](


Don't ever access your bitcoins from a computer that might have viruses or keyloggers.  And again, for long-term storage consider a paper wallet.   


Only for professionals, and I suspect even many of them are losing money.


Well first of all, anything you need to buy, check to see if you can get it for bitcoin somewhere first and compare prices.  Also if you spend money at retailers such as Amazon, CVS, Target, etc, try out the Gyft app. Gyft gives you 3% back, plust it would have saved your credit card from having been recently stolen by Target.  Also if you have any local businesses that accept bitcoin directly, try to patronize them to encourage more local businesses to adopt.  Coinmap.org is handy for finding local businesses.


That's the easiest way for most people.  You could also advertise that you'll accept bitcoins other ways, for example selling junk via Craigslist.


A lot.  Just keep reading, asking questions, and participating in discussions.
And welcome!

As it is now, if the tipbot were hacked, you could also loose your balance.  The bot does allow you to export your private key, but the bot also keeps the private key so that it can send transactions on your behalf (or refund them if unaccepted).    
So I wouldn't let the bot store any more than a trivial amount.
(blockchain.info/wallet is more secure though because the keys are encrypted and require your passphrase to send)

You probably want to forget about mining.  It's become so highly competitive these days that only professionals can profit at it.  Everyone else mostly is wasting their time and electricity.
The bitcoin "code thingy" you have is probably a paper wallet, basically a private key printed on paper.  You could import it into a wallet such as Blockchain.info/wallet or Coinbase.com.
For coinbase.com, it's under Account -&gt; Integrations -&gt; Import a paper wallet.

If they did though, they would quickly find themselves using a forked blockchain, likely with no transactions able to process, since miners would be creating blocks on a different fork.

How are you accepting payments now?  Paypal's rate ranges from 3% to 33% whereas Bitpay has a flat rate less than 1%.  
You can manually accept bitcoin payments as well.  But the problem is correlating payments with orders.   (there is no way to send a message along with a payment)   So standard practice is to generate a new receiving address for each order.  You could do this manually, but if you have a lot of orders it becomes tedious.   The other option is to modify your web server code to automatically get new addresses for each order.

If buying physical goods, credit card thieves could get caught when physically receiving the goods.
There's no point in stealing most digital goods with credit cards, since the digital goods could just be pirated anyway.  Or if paying for subscription services such as Netflix with stolen credit cards, the service could be terminated when the card is realized to be stolen.
Buying bitcoins with stolen credit cards or Paypal is different though.  Once the thieves have the bitcoins, there is no way to recover the funds and no way to identify the culprit.

The private encryption key, which is what is actually needed to send bitcoins from an address, is just a long number.  Usually these are stored in a wallet file, but it could be printed on paper also.  In file form, the private keys could be stolen by computer viruses.  So paper is more secure.
In this case, Coinbase keeps and manages all the private keys associate with your online Coinbase wallet.  When you use the export feature though, you are taking control of a private key, and thus all access to the funds at that address.  Beware, that means if you lose the paper wallet (or someone else finds it and makes a copy of it) then you've lost your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:52:47
1)  Fees.  Yes they will probably get higher as it becomes more popular.  Two things can be done to address this.  First, certain transactions can occur off the blockchain.  For example currently uses the blockchain for every tip.  Whereas Coinbase's new Reddit tip service does not use the blockchain, so no fees.  So yes, you'll see "bitcoin banks" such as Coinbase allow fee-free transactions internally amongst users.   Second, the protocol could be changed to increase the maximum size limit of a block to accommodate more transactions per block.
2)  Not everybody needs a copy of the blockchain.  Light clients such as Electrum, which do not download the whole blockchain, are becoming more popular.  Also to put the size into perspective, see [Blockchain versus Breaking Bad](
3)  The core devs control the open-source process, including quality control.  It is public though, so there are lots of eyes watching it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:59:47
That's quite possible.  
The protocol might also be expanded to allow more transactions per block.
Also in the future the blockchain may be used less for day-to-day services.  For example, right now, every time someone tips on Reddit via the tipbot, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.  To operate more efficiently, the tipbot could instead handle tipping internally, then only use the blockchain for deposits and withdrawals.  This would reduce bloat on the blockchain and reduce fees for microtransactions.

If you can't change the address associated with your pool account, then simply create a new pool account and assign it a new address from Electrum.
Then you can use Electrum's 12-word seed as your backup.   With that seed phrase you could install Electrum anywhere and restore your wallet.  Everything is magically in sync and no backups needed.
Electrum is the ideal solution.  As an alternative, you could migrate to using a blockchain.info/wallet account.  But you'd still need to maintain regular [backups of your private keys](  There's still a possibility that new keys would not be in old backups though, that's why Electrum's seed is the ideal backup.

As it is now, Coinbase is acting as your wallet.  You can continue with this if you're comfortable trusting Coinbase to hold your coins.  This should be fine, but I should point out there's always the risk the Coinbase's wallet service could shutdown, become inaccessible, get hacked and loose their bitcoins, etc.  Not likely to happen to Coinbase, but other less professional hosted wallet services have experienced these problems.
You could instead install a local client to store your bitcoins, but then you have to worry about personal PC security and performing backups.  If you do decide to go this route, I recommend [Electrum]( running on Ubuntu.
If you're looking for long-term storage, a good solution is to use Coinbase's [paper wallet feature](  This way you maintain full control of your private key, but it can easily be imported and exported out of your Coinbase wallet. Print a few copies and keep them safe.

I do expect Bitcoin will evolve over the years and decades, and perhaps mining will look very different in 50 years.

Indeed.  It is up the miners to prioritize transactions based on fees.   As of now, most blocks do not contain the maximum number of transactions, so most miners will include any transaction, regardless of the included fee.  But eventually you can expect higher fees to earn priority confirmation.

Usually Coinbase will allow you to lock-in the price of the bitcoins while the funds are taken from your account.  To do this though, they are buying bitcoins for you and holding them until your dollars are transfered, ie. basically extending credit so you can get today's price.
But they have a limited pool of credit.  So when their pool of credit is extinguished on busy days, the only option they have to offer you is to buy coins for you when your dollars actually arrive.  
You should have been advised that the stated amount was an estimate and the price could change.  And indeed the price went up between the time you made your order and the time it was completed.  
Bank transfers are not instant.  There is a delay between when you see money removed from your account and when Coinbase sees it appear in their account.

One bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal places.

If BTC-e and Bitstamp are diverging in prices, I bet it is because of an arbitrage delay.   The price has been so volatile in the last few days, and fiat takes a few days to move around from exchange to exchange.
Right now to get dollars into CampBX, you have to mail them a check.  Obviously that's a hassle, so there isn't much buy demand there.  I expect that situation to change signfigantly once they implement ACH bank transfers.

When you make a purchase, it takes over a week for Coinbase to receive your dollars via bank transfer.  For them to be able to offer you today's exchange rate when you place an order, they purchase coins using their pool of dollars.

The tipbot is just a front-end for a wallet service.  You deposit coins with the bot, then withdraw when ready.  [Here]( an infographic describing the service.  And here's a tip to try it:
+tip 03 mbtc verify


Miners basically provide the service of recording transactions securely.  The more miners that participate, the more secure the network is.   A miner's profitability depends on many factors.  The first factor is how many hashes per second the miner can generate.  CPUs are orders of magnitude slower at hashing than GPUs, which are now orders of magnitude slower than ASICs.   The second biggest factor is the difficulty, determined by how much other hashing power is currently running.  As more miners participate, the difficulty increases so that mining becomes less profitable for everyone.
If you want to try an actual miner written in Java, try [BitMinter](  


Simple supply and demand.  People bid on coins at exchanges such as MtGox.  The price is the highest current bid amount.

If he creates blocks (mining), he could elect to include all the spam transactions he likes, but if he does so at the cost of ignoring real transactions, he is losing money by not claiming the transaction fees that will be claimed by other miners.
Otherwise this would have no effect, since there is already a maximum rate at which the blockchain can grow.

Would have better to say statically finite.  There are huge amounts deep underground.  How much will ultimately be economically feasible to extract?  Nobody knows.  We don't even know an exact figure for how much already exists above ground.
Yes, the supply of bitcoins is inflating, but a predicable rate.  We know *exactly* how many there will be.

If you're running Windows, which of course is prone to virus infections, so you should know that viruses these days look for bitcoins to steal. So ideally, run Electrum (or any other wallet) from Ubuntu Linux. You can even run it from a live boot CD.

Every four years the block reward halves.  It used to be 50bitcoins per block.  Now it's 25.  In a couple years it will be 12.5, and so forth until the block reward doesn't exist.   Eventually transactions fees will be worth more than the block rewards.  It's meant to be a gradual change, to keep miners creating new blocks even without the built-in reward.
Also transaction fees help to prevent "spammy" transactions.

I wouldn't be surprised if Google is already considering how to implement Bitcoin into Google Wallet.

The escrow service acts as a third party of the transaction.

You can see the balance move from address to address through the blockchain, but that doesn't necessarily tell you *who* controls the coins.

If this helps, think of blocks in the blockchain serving as a form of timestamp.  The next block mined could include mx1 or mx2.  Being recorded in a block on the blockchain is confirmation that the transaction is permanent.  At that point a double-spend is only possible if a fork in chain occurs, but with each block in the chain added after your transaction, you gain greater confidence that a double-spend is impossible.
If you haven't yet, read Satoshi's whitepaper:

Well you're already running Linux, so you're ahead of most people.  Ideally run Mint from a read-only live boot CD.   I like using Electrum, because you can quickly regenerate your wallet each time using a [12-word seed](


Create another wallet somewhere else, such as blockchain.info/wallet.  Send a little bit from one wallet to the other.


Maybe for mulitple purposes, such as a personal account and a business account.   Or maybe using Electrum for long-term secure storage versus blockchain.info/wallet for day-to-day purchases.


With Electrum, nothing.  Just remember those 12 words.  With other wallets, you are backing up a file that contains all of the private keys that constitute your wallet.

Yes, I'm sure it is a horrible exchange rate.  Then BitcoinNordic would probably also charge a fee.  Unfortunately convenience often costs a premium price.
If you want a larger quantity, another suggestion is to try to purchase directly from MtGox or BitStamp.net.  (Assuming if you have a bank account you could perform an international wire transfer.)  Then perhaps you could even become the first local trader, and make a profit selling to others.
Or just post on localbitcoins.com that you want to buy, then wait for a response.  Perhaps a visiting tourist will be interested, or an emigrant wishing to send a remittance.

Coinbase is the best place to buy, and it is alright as a wallet to get started.  Make sure you've enabled 2fa (phone verification) to help keep your account secure.
If you want to store your bitcoins long term, you'll want to consider moving some to cold storage (in case Coinbase ever goes down).  Possibly a paper wallet, or possibly running Electrum from a secured (virus-free) computer.

* Issue number 1 then causes the price at Gox to be higher than everywhere else.  So you should not buy at Gox, because you would be overpaying.
* Their trade engine was not designed to be able to scale. It freezes as soon as there is any spike in trade volume.  This and a number of other reasons make Mt Gox seem very unprofessional.  
For a long time people continued to use Gox simply because there were no better alternative.  Fortunately today there are.

I bought a 12-month subscription card for Spotify, from a seller with a high feedback score. (At the time Spotify had revoked access for Americans to purchase gift cards directly.)
The code was sent immediately and successfully activated.  I left positive feedback and released funds to seller.  
After 30 days Spotify informed me that due to a chargeback on my account, they were not only canceling my 12-month subscription, but also deleting my account.  An old account, so this was an inconvenience.  At least it was just Spotify.  Can you imagine if you had your Steam or Xbox account canceled?
Bitmit doesn't allow followup feedback, so I didn't even have a way to inform other potential victims.  Although I did later notice other victims had been buying new auctions, just so they could leave negative feedback. 
I posted about it at the time on suggesting Spotify and Netflix could avoid these situations if they accepted bitcions directly, instead of going through shady sellers on Bitmit (no offense to OP, who seems legit).   Seems I got a lot of downvotes for this suggestion.  Apparently I was a dumbass for not considering that a gift card can be reversed after having been spent.

A fraudulent transaction wouldn't even register as valid, even at zero confirmations.

The blockchain is a sequential list of blocks. Within each block are records all of the transactions that have occurred since the last block was created. So if you were to look at each block in the blockchain, from the genesis block to the current block, you could calculate the balance of every address.
When you send some bitcoins to another address, it creates a transaction that gets recorded into a new block on the blockchain. As everybody else on the p2p network sees this new block, they now know the new balance of your address as well as the new balance of the address where you sent the coins.


Miners create the blocks of the blockchain, essentially processing transactions.   So that transactions can be processed in a decentralized manner, with no central authority, mining is set up to be competitive.  To find each block is a race, with the wining miner (or pool of miners) receiving a bitcoin reward, including any transactions fees that were donated during that block.  This incentivizes a decentralized, yet highly secure payment processing network.  


Earn it somehow.  A few ideas off the top of my head:
* Buy some from an exchange or service such as [Coinbase]( or with cash by arranging to meet someone on [LocalBitcoins]( 
* Clean out your closet/garage, and sell items on [BitMit.net]( an eBay-like site using bitcoins, or on * Apply for jobs on or [Coinality](
* Rent your house/appartment or just a room on [9Flats]( and get paid in bitcoins
* Sell some MMORPG items on [Ogrr]( a trading forum for gamers using bitcoins
* Perform some easy, but low-paying tasks on [CoinWorker]( a site similar to Amazon Mechanical Turk for bitcoins
* Become a local seller on [LocalBitcoins]( especially if no one else in your area is already doing so.  Charge a commission.

You could probably use a bank to send an international wire transfer to Bitstamp, but that would be cost-prohibitive unless you were buying a large amount.  It might be worth it if you wanted to share the fee with some friends, or buy several bitcoins to resell on Localbitcoins.
Another option:  You can buy [CashU]( credits in Ghana, which can be traded for bitcoins at [BitcoinNordic](  (Also [Ukash]( which can be traded for CashU.)

Currently there is a limited number of transactions that can be included per block.  So as transactions compete for space in blocks, the free market would cause fees to rise.

Hey and welcome.
Yes, it is definately possible to buy fractions of a bitcoin.  Coinbase allows purchases of as little as $0.10.   
My advice is to just buy a little from Coinbase to play with.  You'll learn a lot as you go.

Coinbase included a fee, so it should have been fine in that regard.
Coinbase does seem to have some bugs sometimes with transmitting transactions.   Send their customer support an email requesting they rebroadcast the transaction.

Contact customer service. They should white-list your account. If they don't offer to honor your purchase price, tell them as politely as possible that they should do so as a fair business practice.  In most cases they will do so.
CampBX is a terrific alternative, as long as you don't mind mailing a check.  They usually have a lower price than Coinbase too.

Coinbase is still the possibly the best option at the moment.
A few other though:
* Bitquick.co - Deposit cash at a bank branch.

* CampBX - Currently inconvenient because you have to mail them a check.  Supposedly they're going to support bank transfers on Nov 20 though.

Certainly.  The simplest way to accept payments is to just give someone your bitcoin address.  However it may become confusing trying to track which payment corresponds to which customer order.  So usually a new payment address is generated for each customer order.  Of course for a large volume of business, this could quickly become a headache if you were to manually track each payment.
So you might still consider Bitpay because they still help with the accounting by offering order invoices, reports, etc.  Bitpay will let you choose which percentage of payments you want converted to dollars, from 0% to 100%.  Most businesses opt for 100% because it eliminates any risk due to volatility, and it seems to make the accountants happy.

Electrum's interface is pretty basic.  You've got a send tab for sending bitcoins, and a receiving tab listing your receiving addresses.  The history tab displays previous transactions.
If you try it out and get stuck on anything in particular, let me know.

Almost all of them are just clones of Bitcoin.  They just took Bitcoin's source code, tweaked a couple variables, then re-released it, offering no real innovation.   It's just a "me too" thing.   
Namecoin is an exception, since they actually created some new features, which serve a real purpose.

That depends on the merchant.  Most merchants price in USD then the conversion is done at the time of sale.

In the sense that they are both digital, yes.  But the similarity ends there.  Primary differences:
* Bitcoins have a finite quantity:  a maximum of 21 million will ever be created.  Reddit karma points: unlimited number will be created.
* Bitcoins exist in a global, decentralized p2p data store.  Reddit karma exists only in Reddit's servers.
* Bitcoins are transferable, thus tradable for goods and services.

Moving dollars internationally is not as cheap as you think it might be.  If it were you have to assume others would be doing it as well, lowering the potential profit, making the exchanges already almost as efficiently priced as possible.

Transactions received after backing up will still be contained within the wallet.  The only caveat is if you frequently generate new receiving addresses, they may not be contained in the backup.

Usually Coinbase will allow you to lock-in the price of the bitcoins while the funds are taken from your account. To do this though, they are buying bitcoins for you and holding them until your dollars are transfered, ie. basically extending credit so you can get today's price.
But they have a limited pool of credit. So when their pool of credit is extinguished on busy days, the only option they have to offer you is to buy coins for you when your dollars actually arrive. 
Try again periodically throughout the day though.  It is a rolling limit, not per calendar day.

Because you may need something today, in which case you don't care how many you can buy tomorrow.
The deflationary nature of Bitcoin doesn't prevent spending, but it does make purchases less impulsive and more need-based. IMO, this is a good thing.
Everything we do today is based on economic expansion, but man can only expand so far on this one planet.
Our global natural resources are limited, why shouldn't our global currency also be?
To me Bitcoin sounds like a path to sustainability.
