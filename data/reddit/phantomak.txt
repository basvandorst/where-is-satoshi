NO. I lost almost half a bitcoin through JAXX a few months back. Abort. Avoid jaxx.

Let's say you bought on Coinbase on Monday when btc was at 11k, and it takes the 3-5 days until you 'have' it from your bank, etc, like they do. Do you benefit from the amount it has gone up between Monday and Friday (or whenever it's actually there in your wallet? Or is the official starting value for your investment only wherever it is on Friday?

Based on a transaction I made a few months back, its about $15 USD to buy 1k btc, so you end up getting $9985 worth of btc since they take that cut. Is that what you're asking?

Thanks, dude. Where is this from?
I already appear to have a new and empty Jaxx wallet, not sure how it occurred, but I'm currently working on trying to read the localstorage file in my computer circa this article: 
(it's appearing as gibberish with hollow boxes when I open it with paint, notepad, etc, and thought I downloaded SQLite to open it, I am still unable to do so (can't locate the exact file when searching on SQlite, and SQlite isn't appearing as an option to use to open it when I look through my files on my computer.)

Yeah I somehow don't recall ever seeing a phrase or any message indicating there was one. I thought I'd been as meticulous about this whole process as possible but the first time I heard of a 12 word backup phrase was tonight.
