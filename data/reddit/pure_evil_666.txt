I don't buy Bitcoin at all anymore. I work and get paid in BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:46:31
Thanks for that. I've forked it and will look into it more.

My transactions are nobody's business except mine and the party I transact with.
Everyone else can fuck off. None of their business.

Yet they did nothing and didn't reinstate videos or remove strikes.

Stackin' sats!
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:08:31
Um. I need to buy things like food and gas, and they don't take BTC.
Makes it a bit hard.
For the time being, we're still condemned to using fiat.

Upvoted for visibility because it's a good question with some wicked cool answers -- already posted in here, so I won't repeat them. How Bitcoin gets around this is just fantastic, even if difficult.
@_date: 2019-12-07 21:09:41
I've had a half dozen of these in Discord in the last little while. 0.1, 0.4, whatever. Scam.

KYC isn't a problem. You can use multiple exchanges. Traces disappear with enough exchanges and hops.
@_date: 2019-12-27 04:01:28


All the more reason why we need Bitcoin. We need to reduce presstitute media and government power as low as possible.
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:22:04


This is the correct answer.
@_date: 2019-12-04 06:07:45
I get paid in Bitcoin, so I'm **FAR** more likely to buy something if I can pay in Bitcoin. 
Credit cards and fiat are really much more difficult.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:55:15
I can create basic transactions already, so what I'm really looking to do is create more advanced transactions, e.g. multiple in, out, and nameupdates. 
I really want to do this for the Xaya and Namecoin blockchains and mostly for creating sophisticated Atomic Transactions (not to be confused with Atomic Swaps). 
Since xaya-tx and namecoin-tx are basically the same as bitcoin-tx just with a few more features, e.g. nameupdate, I figure it's easiest to learn bitcoin-tx and then shoehorn in the other blockchain stuff. 
Thanks for the response though! It all helps.

IIRC it's just part of the Bitcoin Core code base and written in C++ like most of Bitcoin. I think only unit tests and the like are written in Python for Bitcoin. But, if you want to be certain, check the code base on GitHub for yourself.

Hey, thanks for that!
@_date: 2019-12-12 02:21:54
Good points. I was just speaking for where I am. Regional laws matter.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:42:58
Thanks, but I didn't find the man pages very useful. Kind of like those programming tutorials: 1) Turn on your computer, 2) Write the program.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:59:21
That's a pretty good article. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2019-12-30 23:14:05
The coin controls in the Bitcoin Core wallet are excellent.

If you're trading with it, and it's on Kraken, then there's no tax implication.
Tax implications happen when you realise a gain, e.g. make a profit and then withdraw profit. 
While you're actively trading with coins on an exchange, you've not realised any profits yet. 
Also, if you keep your profits in BTC, then you've not realised a profit until you convert that BTC to a gain such as through selling it for fiat or through converting it to fiat by making a purchase of a good or service that has a fiat value. (They'll always have a fiat value because even if you buy in BTC, you can still do the exchange rate conversion to fiat.) 
I hope that helps.

Kraken is definitely one of the best if not the best exchange out there.

It's a Bitcoin utility for handling and creating transactions. It's mostly for developers. It's a compliment to bitcoin-cli.
@_date: 2019-12-10 21:17:22
Kraken is a fantastic exchange and has the best CEO out there. Jesse rocks!

I had one guy like that try to scam me. Tried to convince him just to do some honest work. He said he was pretty ashamed of himself.
@_date: 2019-12-27 04:02:42
I want everyone to migrate there.
