Large transactions have such a high priority that fees are never required on them.

It's similar, but it takes a lot more work to lose 100% of your money day trading.  Even if you go all in on something that loses value, it will still have *some* value.  He literally put his entire bankroll on an "all or nothing" bet and ended up with ZERO instantly.  
  
Both have their downsides, but one is a MUCH faster way to get rid of all your money.

I'm not entirely sure why people think they're making some sort of amazing insight when saying things like this.  You're telling me that a language with simplistic syntax and low barriers to entry will attract entry-level programmers? No shit?!

Well *technically* it's up to the miners, and big pools have written custom software to pick out which transactions to include (although that is falling out of favor.)  The specifications for the bitcoin protocol say-


* It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.  
* All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.  
* Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)  
This transaction was less than 1000 bytes, so it was safe anyway... but the priority is gigantic.  It needs to be 57 million, and for this tx it was roughly 55 TRILLION.  Huge.  
 
Of course it makes sense that the biggest bitcoin transaction in history would also have the highest priority ever. :)

Ah, ok... I thought you meant bitstamp was being cheap. ;)

What about cash, then?  "I swear, this pile of ashes was $100,000..."
I see one possible way it could work.  You write up an affidavit stating your ownership, and sign it with your private key.  You can put a copy of that anywhere.  After the fact, you produce that affidavit with your name on it and they can check the signature.  They can also put the public key on a "watch list" to see if the coins ever get spent.  If they were truly lost forever,  the coins would never move out of that address.
Of course anybody willing to jump through all of those hoops is probably also smart enough to sort out good backups...

Neato.. I created this gallery... nice to see someone found it useful. :) I've been following the thread on btcman through google translate, as well as some other discussion on bitcointalk.  The interesting thing is that if you look up the airbill number, the shipment was for **135** boxes.  That means almost a million chips.

I was messing around with this a while ago, and the dumbest wallet in existence is the one with no passphrase at all:
  
    echo -n "" | sha256sum
    e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855
Now, if you take that private key and paste it over into bitaddress in the "wallet details" tab, you'll end up with the address 1HZwkjkeaoZfTSaJxDw6aKkxp45agDiEzN.  And lo and behold.... 
  
  
Somebody's actually been using it.  Nothing substantial, I think it was more for the novelty of it than anything.

I seriously laughed out loud. That was a great joke.

You need to pay more attention:






It clearly shows the date on the confirm screen.  Here are some pink arrows for you:   
  
Additionally, you can cancel a transaction right after you have put it in.

There is still an incentive- transaction fees.  There will come a point long before the block reward dropping to zero that the transaction fees outweigh it, and even after there is no reward the fees will still exist.  For instance, here's a recent block with 0.25 BTC worth of transaction fees:   
 
Assuming that the transaction volume stays constant- which I doubt it will- That means that the transaction fees paid for this block in particular would be higher than the block reward after eight halvings, which is in ~2041 (0.25 vs 0.195, roughly).

Yup, and if those really are the chips from the avalon batches that have sold so far... 64 out of those million are allll mine.  I'm going to be so rich!!
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:04:54
Sure. And there are solutions out there that won't destabilize BTC by mucking with the block rewards or anything like that.  They could raise the block size limit by a static amount today, and while it would require a hard fork for the bitcoin client it wouldn't be TOO painful.  We already went through a hard fork a month ago, and I'm not sure anybody even noticed.  
  
(edit) Also, one other thing- at the limit of roughly 2500 TX per block (which is actually just over 4 TPS, not 6), that means 1.25 BTC reward in fees.

Not even close to correct.  At the current rate of difficulty increase (around 20% every two weeks) you won't hit ROI at these prices until next year... if at all.
