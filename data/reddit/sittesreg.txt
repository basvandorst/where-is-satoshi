@_date: 2013-04-10 11:17:22
Bitcoin is the internet of money.
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:43:20
Yes, Opencoin is the "Central Bank".
It's kill the volatility, not like in bitcoin.

This guy made a very good screen for mtgox.
Try buttons on the top of the screen, there are many good features!
Don't forget to donate him!
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:21:25
speculators or long time buyers/new users, who knows?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:26:36
i don't care.
if it goes down i will buy, if it goes up, i will smile! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:05:47
i know, but we can see the growing of bitcoin sites with it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:35:42
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:19:00

What if Mt Gox started this bubble, with large fake transactions mixed with real transactions? What if they pumped the price up, but now, no money to withdrawals? Who checks them?
@_date: 2013-05-05 05:37:40
and it's still in closed beta.
What will be with 1-2 million users, like bitcoin?
Just sell your XRPs, and keep mining bitcoins, litecoins, namecoins, ppcoins, terracoins, devcoins, ixcoins, novacoins, freicoins, feathercoins, bytecoins, bbqcoins, mincoins, chncoins, bitbars, junkcoins, etc., etc., etc., ... :)
mining... haha

For the rich people it's still play money, for large companies, it's nothing.

The crypto currencies are ONE economy.

The new users need to buy bitcoins, like xrps, no difference.
The Ripple system is much better, than Bitcoin.

my fav is bitstamp.net. Smaller than mtgox, but faster!
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:37:21
Bitstamp is better, but smaller
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:33:47
Bitcoin is great, but i don't trust these mtgox guys...
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:16:16
the buyers sell some for cheaper btc
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:26:00
Who are the sellers and buyers on Mt Gox?
Sellers: You can't withdraw your money.
Buyers: You can buy cheaper btc on bitstamp/btc-e/campbx/etc. 
Why would you sell or buy on Mt Gox?
@_date: 2013-06-25 12:37:13

just wait for the next months/years! :)
@_date: 2013-04-05 10:23:33
try bitstamp.net with SEPA bank transfer
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:12:46
You can make a bitcoin exchange too, and trust yourself
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:00:03

And the worst scenario: Mt Gox Close Down
BTC price on Mt Gox: 400-500 USD/BTC, and the Mt Gox guys keep the USD
BTC price on the other exchanges: 2-3 USD/BTC, if you need USD...

@_date: 2013-04-12 13:58:19
correction down, correction up...
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:26:06
Only 1 currency/country!
@_date: 2013-05-04 11:20:41
Because Bitcoin is open source, anybody can copy it easy, and start another crypto currency. Bitcoin is not gold 2.0, because we don't have crypto periodic table, with one gold, like in the real life.
Bitcoin price will go down.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:50:31
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:01:42
it doesn't matter, if you believe in it.

@_date: 2013-04-23 13:52:38
I bought some for US$, and transfered to my ripple account.
You can transfer US$ from bitstamp to ripple account too.
Now $1 = 225 XRP at Bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:54:07

@_date: 2013-04-10 18:31:47
bitstamp 88$
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:28:32
You can buy XRP at bitstamp.net, and i think the new currency at the mtgox will be the XRP, not the litecoin.

@_date: 2013-05-04 11:01:13
Do you remember that 1 BTC for 50,000 XRPs?
Now 1 BTC = 10,000 XRP!
Ripple is the new Bitcoin!
Bitcoin is infaled with litecoin, ppcoin, namecoin, feathercoin, etc., etc., ...
Bitcoin is open source, anybody can copy it easy, and start another crypto currency.
Bitcoin is not gold 2.0, because we donT have crypto periodic table, with one gold, like in the real life.
