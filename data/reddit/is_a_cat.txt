he committed satoshi 
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:46:07
got em. no idea what to do with them but i like the idea. I think it would be cool to make a game with in-game currency using colourcoins.
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:42:44
yay! im glad _someone_ liked it. if you need any help, let me know. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:12:33
why is it called bitcoin starter? bitstarter has such a better ring to it

No, no no. if you don't put the QR code up, noone can 'reward' you for using bitcoin

 here is the ugly version. 
Pretty version after i get some sleep.

Hey I couldn't find a bitcoin counter/donate button that was in any way customizable. They all seemed to use iFrames.
Im in the process of making one. All it does is scale a div to show percentage of donations received and fill in stats. 
I'll post the source code once it is done but i would love to know what features you guys would want
sorry about my ramblings. It's late

My first bitcoin tip! Thank you.
@_date: 2013-05-24 10:54:44
This seems pretty dodgy. Hope you get it sorted out.

Bitcoins can be divided all the way down to satoshis. The less bitcoins there are, the more they are worth. we may just end up trading in smaller quantities is all. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:36:05
How is this in any way better than two factor authentication? 
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:52:12
Interesting. I displayed my bitcoin amount with
    aa=$(curl -s ' $((aa/1000))\ mbtc
        
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:51:11
Jesus christ did you get lucky there. Take better care of your BTC! :)

[My two cents](
@_date: 2013-05-22 08:13:06
Okay, got something that 'works'. [here](
@_date: 2013-05-22 08:42:11
thank you! the jar fits 24 coins and the way it works is that you set how much the whole jar is worth and it chooses the image with current/max*total. A screenshot would be great as its working fine for me on chrome/firefox.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:45:34
Hey. I made a post about it but bittip it is live [here]( and also on [github](
@_date: 2013-05-21 22:03:59
it's not ready quite yet. It's written in javascript and i haven't got it hosted anywhere yet but [here]( are some proof of concept pics. I should have a working demo posted here tomorrow-ish when i get round to drawing/designing something semi-decent and clean up the code a bit.
@_date: 2013-05-24 06:12:24
Close enough.
@_date: 2013-05-24 06:08:05
Looks good but stick all of the embed stuff into an external javascript file. The only code the user should have to deal with should be 
    &lt;script src="your_code.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div id="my_div"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 
[Here is the tutorial i used]( when doing the same for [my tip button]( Best of luck!
@_date: 2013-05-22 16:32:19
Thank you very much. I'm also curious. I guess, if it where used for a cause "donate 1btc for blah"  it would be more tips the more full and less if it was for personal use. Either way, I've never seen a graphical bitcoin counter so i thought it would be interesting to make one.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:41:18
That's the kind of information that saves you from being thrown off a building
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:05:53
I don't think one thread a week would hurt. Small time developers like myself could benifit from the publicity and loads of people are looking for things to buy with their bitcoins. Seems pretty win win to me.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:03:37
Thank you! I'm pretty new to bitcoin but i'm loving it so far. I'm working on a tip jar style donate button. The number of coins in the jar corresponds to the account's balance. Hopefully it will go up when your donation goes through!
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:14:53
satoshi is currently the smallest unit. It could be divided up infinitely. Otherwise, yes, it could be a problem. It would be a bit silly if that wasn't thought of considering how well thought out everything else is.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:34:31
Gah. this looks so good. Tempted to buy minecraft now. . .
