It's funny seeing you on the other side. I recall seeing you arguing over in r/BTC (I read both subreddits) 
You seemed passionate (arguing about BitCash or something) and I figured you to be a hardCore supporter... it's funny seeing you on defense now XD
No point to this comment, I personally think 2x should be supported (flame me I guess) and Core can implement replay protection if that was really the "big issue" here. 
2x was the agreement (in b4 "I don't remember signing an agreement! To those people: Unless you run a node/miner, own a wallet company, exchange, or merchant service, your voice doesn't mean shit)
I'm out
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:50:29
Yeah, some guy put a list together, better read it
I'm sure it's 100% honest and accurate
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:19:45
Whatever you write is irrelevant, as you've established you just love "gigablockers" head's exploding. Whatever the fuck that means.
Unbiased much? Tool.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:51:55
News flash:
Bitcoin is unregulated. If I, today, somehow took it over and wrecked it, **no one** can do a thing about it. Let alone "sue me."
The exchanges are liable to their customers and the gov't, the protocol itself is irrelevant. Jesus christ. And you sound *creepy as shit* with your "B2X users can be identified." ...So can you, dickwad, now that we're making nazi-ass lists.

Is the OP being paid overtime?
He's been posting nonstop the last 24 hours and he's an annoying fuck to boot
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:32:40
I wasn't asking what it meant. Fucking moron.
Your reading comprehension is terrible. Read it again. 
Clearly anything you write is specifically to troll "gigablockers" (some bullshit term you invented, that nobody uses because you're not a trendsetter)
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:03:10
You sound like a real cunt lmao
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:29:12
I didn't quote Satoshi, I pointed to the actual code which is still visible to anyone today.
The block size increase code *literally exists* and is commented out, because of a temp anti-spam measure. That's not ideology.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:59:18
Apparently not one person here knows how segwit works, thanks a lot for the great answers
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:56:55
You are aware there are multiple SHA-256 coins in existence, right
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:38:24
Because wanting the agreed-upon 2x, after you got Segwit, is unreasonable how? You get your half... so fuck everyone else?
I don't mine and I mostly own Altcoins. But it's easy to see how Core can't just take a win (NYA) and leave it be. Definitely changing my outlook as this unfolds.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:49:38
I LOLED @ "legal"
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:18:23
If you started with 300kb blocks and 17% annual growth, it would be 8 years until 1mb blocks.
Bitcoin was launched in 2009. It is late 2017. Over 8 years. So to claim "1 MB is farr too much already!" goes against your own post.
@_date: 2017-08-27 08:12:59
Nobody thinks about it because most of us aren't complete retards.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:42:07
I read this travesty of a thread and you literally posted what I was going to post ("p2p cash" from the paper.) Good job.
BTC is both a commodity and a currency, why we're still arguing about this in 2017 is strangely humorous.
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:27:21
Good to see you earning your pay.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:32:31
You're the **only** person in the comments, and main post, who keeps talking about a "big block agenda". Has 0 to do with the topic.
Stop perpetrating what you pretend to hate.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:35:53
Fuck off.
I have no horse in this race but have been following the drama, and it's *preeetty* petty to get what **you** wanted, and as soon as you do, shoot the people who helped you get it.
Fucking schoolchildren.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:57:32
Good lord, the *stupid* is strong in here today!
Do you expect them to say "We're making an altcoin durrr"
Fucking hell. It's a **HARD FORK UPGRADE.** My head hurts thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:00:28
I was on the fence until I read the new-ish released Satoshi emails, it's *painfully clear* that block-sizes were meant to go up
Everything from 1mb being a temp "spam measure" (still visible in the code today!) to Satoshi **explicitly saying** the block size could be increased once *stability* is proven. I think it's been proven after like 6 years.
I'm not against L2 solutions as real-world usage increases, but no need to artificially  cripple BTC out of "ideology" or some shit.
tldr: I agree
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:19:47
I say we scale upwards to 300kb blocks, maybe smaller
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:46:54
I'm not quite sure "deflation" equals "ponzi scheme" but I guess time will tell.
The price does fluctuate over time, bringing "skill" into the equation. (Day-trading, smart buy-in times)
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:55:12
You just blew my mind with a non-retarded comment in this thread
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:26:49
His main email was compromised, and a hacker gained access to a few forums and possibly anything relying on that main email address.
**And really, I'm downvoted?** OK, pretend Satoshi is still around then. This subreddit quality is traaash now LMFAO
Do your own google search next time. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:00:18
Here's how easy it would be if you had even a speck of knowing the market will go down (in this case, China, but can be anyone):
1) Go to reddit/rbitcoin
2) Use some sockpuppets to religiously  spread "hold" (spelled correctly because I'm not fucking 12)
3) Attempt to shame people smart enough to play the swings (Usually **rreeee**ing along the way about holding and how anything else is stupidity)
4) Laugh at the idiot bagholders as the price plummets, use sockpuppets to reaffirm HOLDDDERRRPP was the right call.
5) (optional) Wait for the "BUY DA DIP" tards and sell into them too.
Rinse and repeat.

I shouldn't have even wasted time on this. It's not even written in his style.
Just didn't feel like letting the noobs get tricked I guess. Believe what you want. Later.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:59:14
Not a problem. I don't know much about the physical Bitcoins, they've always been a cool item though.
I highly doubt it's "fake"... but yeah, google is your friend. I hope my reply gets you pointed in the right direction
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:53:01
You must be from China.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:13:43
Ok, that has nothing to do with the question i asked
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:35:28
The easiest way would be to use an intermediary.
For example, send the money to a fresh Bittrex account. From there, send it to where you'd like to cash out.
Thus, when it gets to Coinbase, it comes from Bittrex. Tip: Send as LTC for cheaper/faster transfer. 
Congrats and enjoy.
*Minor Edit:* Keep in mind, this will **not** keep your cashflow from being "tracked", but the gov't is highly unlikely to care about $65.

From a hacked email:


"GMX.com like any other email providers gives alternate email option for password recovery. Satoshi would have used his satoshi as an alternate email during registration.
Hacker registered  satoshi first at anonymousspeech.com which would have been expired by Sept, 2014. Then, using password recovery option at gmx, he gained access to satoshin email.
Satoshin is linked to Satoshi’s online world, P2P Foundation, Sourceforge. Hacker wrote everywhere."

This subreddit never ceases to amaze me.
Developer finally listens, adds fully customizable fee. Bitching ensues.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:57:19

Fake hype
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:39:54
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:28:38
Is this an actual possibility?
Now that I think about it, what are the actual odds of a wallet creating a duplicate key? No method exists to ensure duplicates aren't created?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:12:12
Oh my god...
Imagine discovering that without anyone knowing. &lt;jealousy intensifies&gt;
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:37:51

Mah bad
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:36:48
Cool, so you agree with the content, not the founder's vision.
At least you know your biases
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:27:39
No problem. Just trying to reduce the "fake news" I guess lol.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:30:53
Dude. Did you even click the fucking links I posted.
HIS EMAIL WAS COMPROMISED. THIS WAS USED TO COMPROMISE THE FORUM ACCOUNT AND OTHERS. For example, Bitcoin repository was temporarily hacked on SourceForge.
Quit being a liar and even moreso a moron.

You do know that if your main email is compromised, anything else signed up with it is also tainted?
No? Whatever. Live in your fantasy world, just don't drag others into it.

Lol @ this subreddit. Look at the rabid groupthink in all the other replies.
Sorry you have an actual, valid opinion. I have one too but I learned not to post it here. Bought and paid for.
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:52:18
So what does he have to gain by pretending to be 60+ years old and asking for help?
I understand being skeptical but this is pretty harmless territory.
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:51:24
If you have one of the old physical bitcoins, not only is it worth the market value, it in itself is a valuable collector's item and becoming harder to find.
Don't trust the "agent"... such a thing hardly exists.
The physical Bitcoin either has an "address" on it, or a QR code. This is what you need to retrieve your Bitcoin.
I recommend reading up and trusting **yourself**, I wouldn't be including anyone else. 
The moment you trust someone else with it, in front of a computer -- if it's Chinese to you, you will get taken advantage of. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:44:35
Fuckin weirdos man.
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:16:34
Thank you for the analysis.
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:35:34
Yes, but judging from the front page of r/bitcoin, using Bitcoin is a cardinal sin
It's not going to hit $10,000 tomorrow. I can promise you that. And if I'm wrong even better.
*HODLtard starter pack:*
-"weak hands lmao"
-"why the FUCK would you spend bitcoin?"
-"BUY THE DIP"
-"selling high is dumb, never take profit"

You're 100% correct.
I was going to type it all out, but said meh fuck it. You summed it up better than I would have.
(Unless Bitstamp has an "Instant Buy" function, which I don't think it does)
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:36:51
Only hard to enforce because of mining cartels.
Vertcoin has this same commitment and have HFed with no problem more than once.

Don't be a bullshitter, Nakamoto isn't on the scene anymore.
It's a well-known fact that his old email was compromised years ago.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:15:44
Why do you only look at it from one direction?
Similar to your example, if I buy some BTC, and it appreciates in value, then I buy a TV, I actually paid *less value in fiat* due to the price increase.
Eg, .1 BTC = $440, but if it goes up to $490, and then you buy something, you saved $50 overall.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:25:02
No, they're not.
So many people that can't even verify their basic story before posting it lately. Took me 30 seconds of reading.
@_date: 2017-09-09 19:46:34
Anyone can put 2 spaces. Not hard.
Hopefully this enlightens you. Bottom of the page:
"How did the hacker get into satoshin ?
GMX.com like any other email providers gives alternate email option for password recovery. Satoshi would have used his satoshi as an alternate email during registration.
Hacker registered  satoshi first at anonymousspeech.com which would have been expired by Sept, 2014. Then, using password recovery option at gmx, he gained access to satoshin email.
Satoshin is linked to Satoshi’s online world, P2P Foundation, Sourceforge. Hacker wrote everywhere."
