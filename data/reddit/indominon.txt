Not just nerds. Marketers can (and have) been elected as delegates, and presumably so could legal people, business development persons, etc. Anyone can make a pitch to shareholders as to how they could add value to the blockchain.

BitShares has solved the problem of decentralized pegging. I have used bitUSD to mitigate the variability of the cryptocurrency. It works. I assume that Bitreserve would work as well (just as MtGox did in its time and venue), but it is extremely centralized and therefore inherently risky. There is nothing like bitshares.org at the moment.

The chances of them not Goxing it up are close to zero. Have you seen the CEO, Halsey Minor's, bankruptcy and litigation history?
Breathtaking that he even is allowed to be an executive of a corporation.

Since Silver is one of my favorite investments (I think it is hugely undervalued), I have just started to use bitSILVER on the bitshares decenralized market to hedge my cyrptocurrency exposure. I thnik it hedges me against a downturn in the crypto prices,, and lets me capture a rise in silver prices. Win/Win from my perspective.

Yes! That is what is needed.

Although this seems at least highly desirable if not outright necessary, I can't see it happening.

You are going to trust Halsy Minor to hold your funds?
Nobody here ever been Goxed? Central point of failure anyone:
"Minor currently owes over 10.4 million dollars in taxes to the State of California which have gone unpaid since 2009. 
Minor filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in Los Angeles in May, 2013.[17][18] "

Yes, the author has a point. The title should have said first person to get hired "full time" by a blockchain. 
But mostly the article is FUD

I had to watch that three times to absorb everything. It is very imformation dense - and very very good!

The bitGOLD and bitSILVER markets seem to be very thinly traded.  Is this a chicken and egg problem?
