Yes, it's easy to critique from the sidelines. I'm guilty myself. However, there are many moving parts/factors/personalities involved with putting on a conference like this. Nevertheless, I encourage you to put one on and show us how it's done.

I hadn't heard of him either but he looked credible at the time. I actually liked several of the blog posts that he wrote. Shame on me for not digging deeper but, then again, I don't have the investigative resources of Wired and Gizmodo lol.
@_date: 2015-12-11 05:13:17
This was my conference and, yes, I could definitely stand to improve it (I will). It was a great learning experience and a blast at the same time. I'm looking forward to the next one.

Steven Michaels here. I invited  to participate in the conference and she did an amazing job lining up this panel. She lined up the speakers (yes, Ed Moy too) and deserves all the credit for making this panel happen - including encouraging Nick to get out more and talk more about his work (please tip her at the address in the video comments). She introduced me to Craig and recommended him for the panel.
Is Craig Satoshi? I don't know but he sure seems to have the credentials and, from what I've read, he's very strong in the liberty philosophy - often quoting Rothbard. I identified with him when I read his blog post on property rights [not sure if it's still up] which, ironically, was the topic of [my presentation]( at the conference. That is why I queried him further about it.
My impression is that he is a smart (understatement) and likable guy who could very well be Satoshi but I am no computer scientist. Whether he is or not I think people should cut him some slack and see where the cards fall. Nobody deserves to be harassed by the State and I feel for him.

Yup. In my view you're not using bitcoin when you have your private keys held with someone else who has KYC'd you.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:59:40
Sure. Now we are seeing where the cards are falling and it is sad that someone who is obviously bright has made so many bad choices.

I apologize, I didn't mean for my reply to sound snarky. It's been a crazy 24 hours. This was our first conference and we learned a lot and I do appreciate the constructive criticism. The D Hotel was an excellent venue and the event was great. We will learn from it and do better at the next event.

You may still be an MSB but you don't have to collect customer info if it is kept under $1k per day per person:
@_date: 2014-10-27 20:42:55
It's quite simple, really. Don't load your machines with any more than $1,000 per day and it becomes impossible for someone to buy more that that amount. If the machine is empty when they get there, they can come back the next day when it is restocked.

For now, there is actually a daily sales limit of $1,000 at the hairstyling shop - so no one can buy more than $1,000/day.
Both shops are small enough that the owners can add funds to the machine if it sells out and a new customer comes in for the first time that day.
TL;DR: Owners can monitor if someone is attempting to buy more than the daily limit.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:48:57
No, simply put dollars in and it will send bitcoins to your address (scans your qr code).

Thanks Roger! I try to emulate your strategy of hammering home the same soundbite every time you are interviewed:
"Bitcoin is the most important invention in the history of the world since the internet...Bitcoin is going to change absolutely everything. It's the first time in the entire history of the world in which anybody anywhere on the planet with the internet can send and receive money with anyone else and it's impossible for any third party to interject themselves into that transaction."
"It's the first time in the entire history of the world in which now anyone can send and receive any amount of money with anyone else anywhere in the world without having to ask for permission from a bank, a corporation or government."
To that I am also hammering home the meme that "Bitcoin is freedom - freedom to have greater choices and more control over your money."

Merchants who WANT bitcoin will do what it takes to accept it. Not everyone will want bitcoin until they see their local national currency fail at an alarming and accelerating rate.
The rising demand for better money and a better store of value will force these people to get on board out of pure self interest.

No, it is simply enforced by only loading the machine with $1,000 worth of bitcoin per day and when it sells out it sells out. The owner can top it up if they see that a new customer has come in for the first time that day. The shops are small enough for the owners to monitor this.

Use bitaddress.org (or my favorite: [CoinKee™]( to create several BIP38 encrypted wallets with one passphrase. 
Before sending money to the second address, test your passphrase on the first encrypted private key by scanning it with your Mycelium app. If it works, discard the first one (because it is no longer considered cold storage) and send your funds to the second address that was encrypted to the same passphrase.
Make 3 copies and store them in 3 separate locations.

Remember that you are already a million miles ahead of the general populace. You may not feel like an expert but, in fact, you are in the eyes of the masses. The most important point is that you understand how to properly set up bitcoin wallets and explain the risks to your clients. 
If you don't feel comfortable, by all means, don't work with clients until you do. The certification validates that you do, indeed, understand basic wallet security. You can build on this and take it as far as you want to go. 
Naturally, bitcoin is moving so fast that we are all learning new things everyday. Your sincerity and commitment to gaining new knowledge will determine your success.

Agreed. This is what we promote to merchants at  
We also give them a free, web-based POS system where we never touch their private keys.
We focus on catering to merchants who actually want to keep and accumulate bitcoins (not instant conversions). Depending on their margins, they can accumulate bitcoins at their cost of goods and get the coins at a discount - even after offering a discount to the consumer.
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:30:25
Well said.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:28:53
I understand how bitcoin works. I have the private key - just not in a Blockchain.info wallet. It is in a different wallet. If the Blockchain Merchant app calls for a bitcoin address then all payments sent through the app should arrive at that address. 
I've contacted their support and they are, indeed, generating "masking" addresses that are supposed to redirect the payment to the intended address. The problem is that is not happening. 
I still have a payment hung up in one of the "masking" addresses and the funds have not forwarded. I'm still awaiting a reply from Blockchain about this. I'll post their response here when I get it.
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:32:41

Each machine is loaded with only $1,000 per day to make it easier to comply with MSB guidelines. We will have an available balance listed for each machine (next 24 hours or so) on the website so it is best to check the balance before heading over.

You are assuming that the State-sanctioned violence is less than regular violence. 200 million people killed by government wars over the last 100 years would beg to differ if they were alive.

If so, then this is extremely misleading. Nowhere in the app does it say you have to use an address that it has the private key to. It simply says "load your bitcoin address." This can cost people to lose money and is a serious problem.

You convert your bitcoins to Teriyaki! :) Honestly, "cashing out" of bitcoins is needed less and less when you can practically live on them by spending them at all of the bitcoin merchants. Worst case, just buy gold with them from one of the many bullion dealers that accepts bitcoin. I have a friend in the commodities business who has a favorite expression, "cash is trash." He prefers anything but dollars...gold, silver, bitcoin, real estate, high-end Swiss watches, etc.

Government-enforced laws are acts of "certain crimes" with the hopes of preventing "possible crimes".

Sorry about that, yes, he paid you through LB's escrow. So the real question is this: Does your LB account show a balance? You answered elsewhere here that the balance is showing zero. If that's the case then, yes, there is either an error at LB or someone hacked your account. Based on what you've described I think it is likely just a LB problem that should be corrected. Good luck and let us know!

Barter Exchanges are not true barter. They are really in the "alternate currency" business. They issue a currency and try to build a market around it. Benefit for members of barter exchanges is potential increased business at the cost of high transaction fees, limited places to spend this alternate currency, and potential inflation by the issuers of the currency. Trade offs must be recognized and accounted for.
EDIT: Nevertheless, it can still be profitable to leverage new business as a member of a trade exchange.

Very possible. Think of it this way, how can national currencies compete against Bitcoin? Capital always flows to where it is respected and protected. I predict an accelerating flight from national currencies into bitcoin as country after country defaults on their debt. Then, nation states will demand settlement in bitcoin. Game over.

Yes, these ATM's are not for everyone. They are only for those who are unbanked or are simply willing to pay a premium for speed, privacy and convenience. No "third-party approvals" are required and you don't have to wait 4 days for your coins to arrive.
Another way of answering the question as to why someone would pay a premium can be found in the answer to this question: "Why do people pay $1.50 for a bottle of water at 7-11 when they can get it at Costco for 25 cents?"

That is not what the author said. He is simply saying that it is better to trade goods and services for bitcoin. Here is the quote and reference:
"The safest way to acquire bitcoin is to let people know that you will accept it as payment for your products and services. Avoid exchanging it for national currencies. The point that people miss here is that national currencies are the very problem that freedom-lovers are trying to get away from. Instead, use bitcoin to trade with merchants and individuals who accept it as payment. Offer it as payment to those who are unaware of it and explain the benefits to them. This will help develop the market and create a solid economy outside of national currencies. After the initial attack, bitcoin has the potential to be one of the most powerful and revolutionary tools to bring about more freedom and liberty to humankind."

I'm not disparaging r/joinmarket as I feel it is an important service and am looking forward to the day that it is "grandma friendly".
A solution baked into the protocol would be best but "off chain" or "side chain" transactions like the Lightening Network or David Chaum's untraceable digital cash using something like Open Transactions could work too.

Agreed. It's the equivalent of the bank rejecting your cash because it has drug residue.

I've always been a fan of BitPay because they did wonders to help bootstrap bitcoin. I have no beef with them but seeing this type of discrimination certainly saddens me. I recognize the fact that they are under pressure due to their jurisdiction. My tweet and post are simply observations of what I am witnessing first hand.

I would only put long term savings/speculation money into. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme. There are too many price swings for short term holdings. Long term I believe prices will be much higher because of the features and benefits it provides. See:

@_date: 2011-12-31 17:02:58
Lower supply does not necessarily mean a higher price. Yes, if demand remains constant (or rises) and supply drops, the price would rise but demand could fall off at a faster rate than supply and the price would drop.
The question being answered by the markets (reflected in the market price) is this: to what extent do people value bitcoin for what it is, does or can potentially do in the future?
@_date: 2015-09-27 05:54:45

@_date: 2015-10-26 06:24:40
There are several ways bitcoin can help this industry. They can take the cash and buy bitcoin which would help to relieve the storage problem. Unfortunately this comes at the expense of exchange fees and the sourcing of large amounts of bitcoin that can be paid for with cash. To counter this they could offer discounts to customers who pay with bitcoins thus shifting the burden of acquisition to them.
Spending the coins is a little easier. They could request that their suppliers accept bitcoin as payment. They could pay wages in bitcoin as well. Vendors and Employees can spend the coins or cash out through the various exchanges.

They monitor the address on blockchain.info to confirm payment. A tablet or smart phone is best so the server can enter the ticket amount and click "request payment". 
To make this work simply paste the address into the Blockchain.info page and you can view and monitor the wallet.

The lender may wish to lend as a way to store his/her coins for safekeeping and would consider the negative interest rate as a fee for the service. Much like the times when people paid the goldsmiths to store their gold.




You are basically "renting" either way. A more important factor is that traditional "easy money" financing - made possible via inflation - is what has driven up prices in the first place. A deflationary currency would actually help bring down the price of housing relative to the deflationary currency.
ADDITIONAL COMMENT: A deflationary currency would actually increase the purchasing power and increase the standard of living for all. No longer would our wealth be "sucked dry" through the silent tax of inflation. A pre-1965 silver quarter can still buy you a gallon of gas today and you can fill up your car with a few silver dollars. Inflation has robbed this purchasing power from us.

Banks are the primary problem. Any service that interacts with the banks is prone to friction.

@_date: 2013-10-28 15:35:19
The real question is "do you advocate theft"? If not, then inflation is bad. If so, then inflation is good.
When property rights are protected (as bitcoin allows people to protect their savings from theft) we have a more civilized society.
BTW, "hoarding" is simply a negative term for "saving".

I agree. When restrictions on voluntary trade increase it pushes more people into "System D". I think Bitcoin can take a prominent role. 
As more people exit the hampered market, the brunt of taxation/restrictions will fall on fewer people who are already at their breaking point. This will push them into 1. the black market; 2. Open rebellion against the powers that be; or 3. the search for a "savior" which might give rise to another potential dictator.
Ultimately, the State will collapse from fiscal and moral bankruptcy. Bitcoin-type currencies can help soften the blow.

Sorry, the point is that some people may prefer to have others safeguard their money rather than do it themselves.


Just a quick google search:
The point is that easy money drives up prices. When there are fewer people willing to borrow in bitcoin (assuming bitcoin becomes the dominant currency) then the demand for buying homes at these inflated prices and expensive financing will fall and the prices will follow.

In a time when there is rapid deflation this is great for the lender but bad for the borrower due to the fact that the borrower will be repaying more value than he borrowed (over and above the interest rate) - unless there was some type of negative interest rate that factored in this deflation. 
Generally speaking though, I would not borrow bitcoin and agree to pay it back in kind as you may be unable to do so in the current climate of rapid deflation. By the same token, I would think very hard before lending bitcoin knowing that it may be impossible for the borrower to ever pay it back.
A good example is the Icelanders who bought homes and borrowed in Swiss Francs yet earned wages in the Krona. When the Krona collapsed during the last financial crisis they were unable to pay back their debt.
On a broader scale this will promote more saving and less borrowing - at least until the rate of bitcoin's deflation moderates which may only be after bitcoin takes over the world.

I see nothing wrong with wealth inequality when that wealth was acquired through voluntary exchange free from coercion.
The fact is that people are not equal. We all have varying degrees of talent and specialties in different areas. To ignore this is to deny reality.

Sounds like you were having the buyer do bank transfers to your bank account. Not good because fraudsters can hijack someone else's account and use their funds to buy from you (sounds like this is what happened to you). When this happens, the banks can easily reverse the transactions leaving you with a negative balance and stuck with the bill.
When dealing with LocalBitcoins.com it is best to do local, cash trades. The next best option is to accept "cash only" deposits (no transfers or wires) to your bank account but "in person" is usually best. It is the screwed up banking system that makes it easy for you (and others) to get scammed.
