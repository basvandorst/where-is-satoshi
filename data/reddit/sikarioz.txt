This guy HODL's 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:41
Bumping this up so your buddy can see it
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:32:17
Each DOGE he makes happy during a walk increases the price of bitcoin by 1k
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:02
Just some Chad bitcoiners doing what Chads do. Which is to be a bad ass

Sunday will be the moment of truth, for all cryptos really

I'd say put 100 now, since Coinbase has just started working for some people. This dip won't last long. Although it peaked at 19 and has corrected to 16, last night it was at 14 so it's still increased greatly from yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:42:43
Yes, look at the chart from the past year. Numbers don't lie
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:45:34
I don't feel he has the intellectual capacity to possess such great power
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:00:11
link your bank account to coinbase. it'll take a few days to process your order, but when you buy it the price will lock 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:22:18
Just a pipe dream
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:47:44
How does one acquire some BAT? Any idea when it's coming on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:49:06
Have any of these guys who made wild promises ever followed through with them? Pretty sure that guy who said if bitcoin reaches 10k he'd eat his own nuts roams the planet with his two nuts
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:21:43
Tbh there's 1000 theories but nobody has a clear answer. I'm guessing it's people trying to get in before the CME gets involved which is on the 10th I believe
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:39:08
Golden Teslas!

Bitcoin is powered by memes, that's by we haven't witnessed a rocket-powered boost to the moon in hours. It's science
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:33:12
The march continues 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:46:17
yesterday bitcoin hit 15k. So stop spreading FUD
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:33:33
Another win for us intellectual "Chad bitcoiners"
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:27:51
True, the market needs to stabilize. But then again, we just demolished the 12k wall and it kept going up
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:49
As with anything in the world, nothing is a for sure thing but 9 times out of 10, there will be more people investing into Bitcoin so yes
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:35
I'll take 17.5 when it's gonna skyrocket to 20k by the night. Win-Win
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:42:20
I agree with you, but if they're going to make a bold claim like that they need to back it up with more than just their opinion
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:47:16
You'll get .15 On coinbase the price locks, even if you don't get your money instantly
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:30:45
just another FUD post. you FUDERS should just make your own subreddit so you all can be miserable  there

My main concern is Trump doing something Trump-like such as being annoyed he didn't invest in bitcoin and launch a full-on war against cryptocurrencies 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:40:50
HODL'ing has always paid off, even during the 2 year long Bitcoin ice-age
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:45
I like this guys optimism. End of the day it is
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:18:46
Don't forget the golden rule of bitcoin: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Although not likely, the market can crash
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:38:26
Everything is lovely until the government gets involved
