There is a line where reversing a single confirmation should lead to stealing, that's somewhere around $200 in my mind, but adjust where ever you'd like. If you are able to get something for your 3000btc after one confirmation and then go back a block and un-include it, I say that's the sellers own stupid fault. There is a reason the rule is 6 confirmations to be sure. 
I don't just throw around "FUD". However, you saying "miners can steal your btc" is plain false. They *may* be able to take their own BTC back if you don't wait long enough to satisfy your risk tolerance for the amount of BTC you have received vs giving up your product. 
TLDR: miners can not steal your BTC. They can "steal" you product by returning their own BTC back to themselves unilaterally after receiving a product from a dumb merchant.

What are you even talking about? The example you gave talked about reversing a confirmation, that's not stealing. That is in effect returning someone's money so they can "try again"  (and destroy their pools reputation).

You can still get interest with "whole money" lending. Look at how bitfinex does it. (I'm sure there are others as well) x amount is debited from your account and given to joe with contractual obligation to pay it back with interest. Whole money interest. 
Edit: yes this is mediated by a 3rd party, but they are auditable at any time to prove full reserves.

It does matter if it's scarce there. The price may be global, but that only matters if you're transferring it globally. Just like we were all suggesting for Cyprus - you can have your own price conversion if you keep everything within the country. If you sell something outside the country, obviously use global prices. 
If 1mBTC will buy you a computer, and they can turn around and use that same 1mBTC to buy something else locally, what does it matter what the global value of it is?

People always want to see the bad side of things. They're what is made public. "DarkMarket is bad, you can buy drugs and guns and stolen merchandise." But you can also buy an unlocked phone to have sent to country with massive controls for real access to technology. You can use it as a way to spread *real* information that the media / government doesn't want to be public - even though it should be.
I think the pros way outweigh the cons on this one. The media and "general public" will hear about all the bad things, because it is something they can't control, regulate, tax and ruin. They want to make anything like that look bad. Just like they tried with bitcoin when it first came out.

You're using the word deflation wrong, but I understand what you're trying to say just the same. I disagree though. 
Changing the current system away from a fractional reserve system and getting away from 2% yearly inflation would change it from banks lending fractions of money (bad)  to rich people lending out "whole" money, which helps everyone.

Bitcoin CAN end fractional reserve. It doesn't mean it will. There is complete transparency with Bitcoin,  unlike any other monetary system that's existed to date. If things are kept open and visible, we can end fractional reserve.

Part 4 is in the works already with maidsafe. The block chain is not scalable. It is, indeed, a perfect digital replacement for gold. I hold (what I consider) a large amount of Bitcoin. I believe in the tech, but not as a day-to-day transactional tech, but as a store of wealth. The maidsafe guys tech is a scalable, digital cash. It can be used as day to day currency. Where Bitcoin is the digital drop in replacement for gold, I think maidsafe currency will be the digital drop in for fiat, as well as having a **hugely** beneficial piece of tech to go along with it.

@_date: 2015-01-30 13:10:19
For now. Long term it is not. Long term fiat becomes less valuable overall. Short term, yes, it's higher than fiat, and that may apply to traders, but long term it's a significantly better store of wealth - it's intended purpose. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 17:27:29
Fair enough. In my opinion however, the indications are there that Bitcoin is here to stay - and with that, the potential to be a digital equivalent to gold. 
I do think it won't be used for day to day transactions, my thoughts are that will belong to maidsafe. That's a completely different topic in itself.

Well, maidsafecoins are just a holder built on top of the master protocol until the network is live. The fake coins were made with counter party.

While I understand your issue, I don't think it would cause any harm for a while (if ever)
Miners would have to take the "size increase" punishment several times in order to have any meaningful impact on block sizes as it stands. They would also have to keep those blocks full (which gets harder and more expensive the larger the blocks are) for a very extended period of time in order to push anyone out.
Also, saying "its too hard to implement" on a technology like this that I (among plenty of other people way smarter than me) believe will change the way the world does finance seems like a bit of a cop out. In my opinion that should never be a reason not to do something worth doing, but even more so on something like this.

The fact that spam attacks pay fees is irrelevant. If its an obvious spam attack, there is no need to increase the block size - it will end and we have to deal with it as we do now. The miner wont increase the block size as as soon as the attack is over, blocks will get smaller again and their loss will have been in waste. Block sizes would only be increased if the miners feel its organic (sustained) growth.
 
And at that point the miners will not increase the blocksize any larger because it wont be worth the payment hit now for the increase in revenue long term. I see no issue here. Am I missing something?

The blockchain is the HUGE thing your client probably spent  a full day downloading and indexing. You read it, when you need something posted to it, you send your transaction to whoever will listen (either no firewall or ports open [I have port forwarding because there's no other way to allow connections to my computer]) and it will eventually make its way to a miner who puts it in a block.

The fact that close groups are relatively small, combined with the facts that 1) id's are ephemeral and change often 2)linking an ID to real life person in the first place would be quite difficult without knowing who they are in the first place. That's my understanding so far. I'm not a dev, just a future user who reads a lot. My understanding could be wrong.

There has been a fair amount of talk on the topic on the forums. Forum.safenetwork.io. 
Doing a timing attack (as you mentioned in your link) would be nearly impossible let because of the network topography. Everything happens in xor space, no you request spiders out in every direction and may not even make it to its "destination" if it hits a cache first. 
Requests for chunks (pretty meaningless pieces of data by themselves, not asking anyone for full files)  from you are received by your close group where your ip is scrubbed. From there they find the controller of the chunks you want, and request it of them. The controllers then actually request the chunk itself. There is no link to you at any point after your close group (much like tor). But unlike tor you can't watch for calls to specific files and link them to the person that requested them. There is no link from chunk-&gt;file for private data without knowing the encryptors private key. For public data you may be able to correlate chunk to file, but linking that to a request is rather hard.

While I can't argue against that, its very true, they aren't going to to away. Not upping the blocksize has absolutely nothing to do with that. In fact, not upping the block size makes it worse as its that much easier to pull it off with smaller blocks.

Close groups are build by collecting 31 other nodes who have an ID closest to your ID. They are constantly moving as more clients come online. Your id is generated at each new login (there have been some changes recently,but I believe it is randomly generated and given to you when you connect so you can't  do any funny business generating it yourself) 


I'm told no. However, I can't explain why because I don't remember. I asked the question on the forum and came away satisfied with the answer. I'll see if I can find it and post the link.

Pico uses a BTC address as your login, but it would also work if you have a static BTC address linked to an account. If you forget your password for the account, they give you a random string and ask you to sign it with the address linked to your account. The only possible way to do that is if you have the private key for that address, thus proving that you are the owner for all intents and purposes.

You can think of your private key like the password to your bank account. You address is only your account number.

I don't mind Glenn Beck normally, but this whole segment sounds stupid. He doesn't know what he's talking about and it's apparent. Also, what he was describing - using the block chain as a messenger and email device, storing data - is a ttteeerrrrrible use of block chain technology. What his looking for is maidsafe. That's for data. Leave the block chain to storing money and *maybe* public data that is ummuatable.  Eg, titles, copyrights and the like. Not private emails. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:23:23
You said earlier you didn't understand the tech to argue a point, but you are so hard on your point. What you keep describing over and over and over can't work. If I found out I had black list coins, I'd send a satoshi to every address with a balance. No one has white list coins anymore... Trying to police the tech in the way you're describing isn't going to happen. 
I'm not saying your premise is wrong, but stop trying to go deeper. It may still be possible using se novel technique we haven't thought of yet. Leave it at the premise. Not only is this sub too pro-btc to have a rational discussion on the topic, but its clear your knowledge of the tech isn't up to par to have the discussion in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:09:16
you could access them from anywhere by importing the private key into any client (mycelium for example). The client them scans the blockchain for any transactions sending that address coin. Every transaction is public. That's how it knows you have the coins in your address - everyone agrees that you "account" holds that much.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:07:19
Like I said. I don't disagree that what you're describing will be attempted and may very well succeed. There are ways around white lists/blacklists/filtering in general that WILL require techniques that we haven't seen yet in order to do what you describe. It's outside of what most people are willing to manually do (as noted elsewhere). I'm not sure - if these methods were put in the core - if it would stall out BTC adoption, but the methods will still exist outside of the core.

Bitcoins are always "stored" in the blockchain. That's how your client knows you have them. They are attached to an address (for simplicity sake) of which there is only one private key to access said address. As long as you send your 10 Bitcoins to an address that you own the private key to, they are stored in the blockchain. Don't lose your private key, or you lose your Bitcoins.

What it seems to me that the article is getting at is that if someone were trying to sell a SL of Gold at the best price they would do it as discretely as possible, where these sell offs seemed aimed at making the market drop.

Like I said, I can call apples currency if I want. You can call stamps currency.
You have to buy XRP from them (profit model) in order to use the "stamps" to send currency between users.
I am not a Ripple fanboy. I honestly don't even plan on using it, but the misinformation going around and everyone talking about "pre-mined" this and "bad currency" that.
Afterthought: If they want to call it a "currency" that's cool. It's a totally internal "currency" used to track who owes who x amount of money. It is not a competition against Bitcoin as a currency that will be used in the wild. You will never trade in ripples. You use ripples as a way to turn Bitcoin into fiat, or Paypal, or e-gold, or apples - and track how much you owe someone for it.

Another thing to keep in mind when reading this article - user grade asics are JUST starting to come out. Sure, ASICMiner has a pretty good head start but so far BFL has just started shipping and they have 60 some wafers being turned into chips as I write (see update from May 22). There are other companies working on making user grade ASIC units as well. When those start hitting the net they'll join the mining pools and everything will move up together. ASICMiner just got there first. That doesn't mean they're going to take over the currency.
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:09:48
I think that's the best way. You can still price things in your native currency, whatever that may be. The conversion happens and reduces that amount from your wallet.

I think this plan of action has great potential if you can get people to follow it. The fact that btc is so easily divisible makes this perfect. This would work well with the donation idea. Heck, they only need 1-2 full btc to make this work to start. 
The only down side I see in this is they still have to buy the goods (flour for bread, beads for jewelry, whatever it may be) in Fiat unless they can create a closed loop. That's hard to establish.

I don't think that's the *only* reason we print money at all. See Davos' posts which I think are quite spot-on. While it does keep interest rates low, it also allows the US to pay back what it owes at significantly cheaper rates.
I never said we should abandon the USD. I also only slightly care about the USD/BTC ratio (I'd like my coins to appreciate as much as the next guy). While I'm not as interested in the ratio, I do believe it will continue to climb.

To be sure, I'm not about to spend your my hard earned Bitcoins, but the point is well taken. 
Bitcoins is pointless unless they are used. If you have access to a somewhat quick transfer of (insert your currency here) to bitcoin, use it to buy (insert shopping cart item) at market price with bitcoins. It helps the economy grow, and you're not missing anything, just transferring.
Sure it's an extra step, but if you believe in Bitcoin, it's worth it.

I had BTC there for a while in the hopes of lending them out to short sellers. I bought them elsewhere and never actually lent them out (no one took my offer) so my experience is only that of getting BTC in and out.
Transferring in was just as simple as anywhere else, 6 confirms and they get credited to your account. Getting BTC out was almost as simple. Put in your request and apparently all out-transactions are done manually once a day for "security." I had my BTC in my wallet within 24 hours.

@_date: 2013-06-15 01:39:08
The size of the transaction has no (little) bearing on the transaction's fee. As a general rule there is a .0001 transaction fee PER transaction. So if there are many people using Bitcoin, and more transactions happening, then the value of the block fee goes up.
Basically, sending $1 and sending $1M have roughly the same cost to send. The $1M transaction will most likely pool multiple previous transactions, making it larger and slightly more expensive to send, but there have been $5 transactions costing $4 to send because it was accumulated with dust transactions.
Also, I think I know what you were trying to say (which I responded to) but what you said doesn't make sense.

They all used to. They made some changes about how small transactions can be and still go through. Some of the sites decided to wait until you got enough and sent you it in  a lump sum.

Just the fact that they make it illegal is a huge stumbling block. Would it kill Bitcoin? No. However, a lot of people wouldn't use it simply because it is illegal.

"they" don't really. As long as the system continues to work as it has for the past few decades, they can continue to get away with it no problem.


The only reason this is feasible in the world economy is because every other country is doing it too. If Japan suddenly decided that the Yen wasn't going to inflate anymore (or any other currency, pick one) the dollar would drop so fast against that currency as to make trade nearly impossible.

The math is wrong. Just because the price dropped $73 doesn't mean the whole 500 tons was sold $73 lower. It had to sell its way down. The final number lost in a 500 ton dump wouldn't be anywhere close to 1.8 bil quoted in the article. Not well thought out logic makes me question the whole thing along with lack of sources.

I don't fully understand the argument. The point of a bank isn't to make money. When the bank makes money, they took it from someone else. Even with the bank making money, most of it is generated in the main offices via loans, not the branch offices. They are basically overhead who use a whole lot of paper and electricity.

They had a schedules maintenance yesterday, and there were some issues with the site since (looked like some backend coding issues) so I don't think it's anything to worry about.

I don't think that's the case at all. There are plenty of people who use only cash when possible simply to stay as under the radar as possible. That doesn't make the clothes they buy illegal. I'd use zero coin as soon as I pulled coins out of any service / trading platform or anything identifying before they hit my wallet simply out of principal.
