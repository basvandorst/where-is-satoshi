Looking at the human digestive tract, comparing it to typical carnivores and herbivores, there are definitely more similarities with carnivores:

Vegetarianism is a myth. Plants have to be fed either:
a) Animal feces
b) Chemical fertilizer derived from fossil fuels
Furthermore, monocrop agriculture displaces millions of acres of natural habitat that originally held wild animals. I don't believe the original inhabitants were rounded up and kindly escorted to a zoo.
Once the soil that monocrop agriculture inhabits is eventually depleted, it is left to desertify and can no longer sustain life until animals refertilize it. Almost all research into dedesertification involves using grazing animals.
Humanely keeping animals (e.g. low stocking density, regularly rotated, abstaining from using hormones/innoculations, keeping animals in land suitable for grazing) is generally a net positive for the surrounding environment. I think we can both agree that vertically integrated Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations operated by a handful of corporations are about as evil and inhumane as it gets, but it doesn't have to be that way. Vote with your wallet and your conscience.

You paid 4x the fees that are clearing through the mempool right now (160 sat/byte) assuming your transaction was 1 input, 2 output.

Kraken is massively faster for cashing out. EFT takes 2 business days instead of 6 business days. The fees are way lower, too. The main downside is Kraken's website requires you to reclick links like a drunken ferret to get your orders to punch in, etc.

I think the intention is that these would be used with mining pools which would offload the actual block creation. Participation in a pool requires very little resources (roughly 32 bytes per new block to get the require hash+nonce values IIRC).

Nope, BCH became more profitable to mine after the 21.39% BTC difficulty jump, so most of the miners hopped onto that coin. The hashrate will return to normal in an hour or so when difficulty jumps on BCH.

That doesn't actually make financial sense. Solar power already has a 20-year contract price that's less than half of the cost of Coal and Gas in the 30 sunniest countries in the world (Australia included). Unless they are literally getting the coal plant, the fuel, the land it sits on, and colocated buildings to house the miners that don't need to connect to the grid for free, they can't compete.

Increase the size of your db block cache (at the cost of consuming more ram).  Took me about 18 hours to sync with -dbache=1500 set as a command line parameter.

I read this book. It was light on technical details, but it captured most of the history up until summer of 2014 and the philosophy behind bitcoin pretty well.

Kraken has XBT/CAD trading already. It's hidden under the "XBT" submenu of tradeable currencies. You'll need level 3 verification (photo ID and proof of residence) to deposit/withdraw CAD, however.

add -dbcache=3000 as a command line flag. Core will sync in about 18 hours on a half-decent connection with that in place.
