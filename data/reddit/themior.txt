6666 is just ten times as horrifying.

Try GMO Coin. Took me less than two weeks to have my account upgraded to 'full access'.

That's the one. You open an account on the website and wait for them to send you your password by post. In my case it arrived less than two weeks after I created my account. I think that's just about as fast as any exchange can verify your account these days.
Anyway, then you use that password to upgrade your account to 'full access' where you need to fill in some more details and upload a verification document. You can buy your BTC immediately afterwards.

It's a trading platform called GMO Coin where you can buy BTC.

I know too well that it's only a matter of time before someone in the religious department makes a statement saying how bitcoin is un-islamic.

Everyone here has made that 'mistake'. I bought at $1000+ during the hype a few years ago and then it dropped to $700. It's bitcoin. If you bought for investment then just be proud you did and don't look back.

I see you're new to reddit too. There's a stickied post at the very top of the sub. Check that out then ask what you don't understand here.

I live in Japan, still waiting to get my account verified :(

Same here. I registered for a Mt Gox account more than a week ago and uploaded my verification documents but they haven't approved them. I bought my first fraction of bitcoin from a trader on localbitcoins instead.
