Belarus or Estonia would be ideal candidates.......either way, BTC keeps chugging along. Cheers!

That's a weird process for them to do in regards to allocating the hashing distribution. 
I was puzzled and worried about who the "unknown entity" could be, especially with possible Antpool's antics on owning their mining pool while influencing other pools without having a direct correlation.

The link for btc.com lists all the mining pools but doesn't show the "unknown" entity.....thanks for the reply, cheers!

Thanks for the .pdf!

Yes, I've been waiting for 2 weeks. Do they have a subreddit? They need to get on the ball with their verification process.

hahaha! Probably put the money to fix the screen into crypto, atta boy! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:05:18
Hahaha! They like to steal BTC, not mine it.

Damn u/LegendsRoom, you took it to another level. I will read the link, always willing to learn something new.....thanks for sharing, cheers!

Never show them anything, son. Let them wonder and educate them about the significance of blockchain technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:04:56
Possibly, wouldn't be too far fetched. I have heard rumors of them getting in the mining business. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:49:39
Ha! No doubt that same thought has cross my mind. I usually tell myself that those people are just too lazy in learning a new concept or they are just too caught up in their old ways that don't want to see change coming........time will tell who is going to look like a sucker, lol! Cheers, dude!

huh?! I don't like Bitmain, I would be interested to split with a group. How would that work?

I don't know, holiday weekend is upon us. People like to cash out either on Friday (before weekends) or right before the holidays......pure speculation and more for me to buy during the dip. :)

I am happy for millenials, new generation, new form of thinking, outside of the box mentality. The older generation is the one delaying mass adoption and that's my main concern. So the question begs, how can we help them understand that blockchain tech is not a ponzi scheme (Bitconnect excluded), not a tulip bubble, fraud, money launderer and terrorism tool? I would really like to know how to help them get that out of their heads, I am not a programmer but if I could help in any other way, I would. It is time for people to open their eyes and realize the potential they are missing out on.

Dang! No way! Sounds like a win win situation ;-)!

I made $6.47 last night, best trading day since I started following crypto. lol!

+1, living up to the name.

IMO, this is one of the main reasons why BTC is/will be extremely valuable. It is almost impossible to break through that much hashing power......Cheers!

The number is supported. I didn't see anywhere on their website if they support data, right now, it seems that texts an calls were the only things they support.
I may be wrong though, I'll give it a try, thanks for the feedback!

My phone plan is up on Monday, does Bitrefill provide data with your plan? I am in the USA......Pretty awesome they have a lightning channel open. 
Cheers!
