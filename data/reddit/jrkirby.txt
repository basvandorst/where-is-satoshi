If satoshi really wanted to convince anybody he was satoshi, he would just have to spend a single satoshi from any one of his addresses. Wright hasn't done this, so he has no good evidence that he's satoshi.
If satoshi came out, there wouldn't be any doubt. It would be pretty clear.

The posts submitted and upvoted on a subreddit reflect the interests, motives and opinions of the majority of it's userbase. for better or worse, is full of people who tend to share a particular political ideology and are quite outspoken about it.

Yeah, some cops are crooks. But most cops just do their job, which does not make them crooks.
I was talking to a guy at my university who was pissed because a cop had ticketed him for underage drinking, he claimed, without any proof. He was reluctant to tell us that he *had* been drinking. Being mad at cops for catching you breaking the law is stupid.

I'm not even sure it's speculators that much. My guess is that the selling pressure is created by people who have a lot of bitcoins, and got those bitcoins when mining was really cheap.
If you mined 1000 bitcoins in 2010, and had &lt;50 thousand dollars to your name otherwise, wouldn't you sell a bitcoin or two a month to diversify your portfolio? Even if you really believed 100% in bitcoin, it'd be stupid not to sell off in that situation.

It'd assume they'd either infect the bitcoin core runtime or executable, changing functionality.

If you tumble, you get a bunch of small deposits on the other side over a longer period of time, and nobody can tell what's going where.

@_date: 2014-08-10 16:47:24
What you're complaining about is that courts tend to favor police. I'm not going to disagree with that. So when there are bad police, often they get away with it, and that's bad. I'll agree with that.
You're completely ignoring is that aside from those two cases (in what I've heard to be a rather underfunded area), the police usually do their best job in keeping people safe. When you call the police, they often arrive fairly quickly and do their best to solve whatever conflict is occurring.
I don't think that having more police necessarily means we'll have less crime, but if we had no police, there'd be a hell of a lot more crime.

The thing I'm worried about is the next reward halving. I know it isn't for a while, but that makes it scary. What if the growth halts a bit beforehand, then when it happens, people start selling asics, and someone picks them up with the intent to do a 51% attack? It's kinda far fetched, but it is a definitely real fear.

You guys broke the law. It doesn't really matter if "Oh it is a stupid law" or "The cops just want money". Don't break the law. It's not that hard. You didn't happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, you happened to be breaking the law.
Don't blame the cop for catching you. It's not the cop's fault that you get in trouble for breaking the law.

I'm not trying to say that police don't do anything wrong. I'm trying to say that most of them do their best job to protect your sorry ass. Cops, like any other person out there, let their prejudices get in the way of their duty. And if you don't like that, help us find the people who never have any prejudices, and then we'll hire them to be cops. Until then, prejudice is an unfortunate fact of life. Not saying it's not wrong, but if we had a way around it, we would have taken it.


Fuck you. I have never condoned genocide. The only place I could ever condone a police using lethal force is when someone's life was in danger.

@_date: 2014-08-10 06:17:33
So you're comparing the war on drugs to the holocaust? Ticketing some teenagers is like mass genocide? That's just disrespectful.
There comes a point where if a police officer is asked to do something immoral to enforce a law, they should disobey orders. But giving a couple kids some fines is not so extreme that it requires insubordination!
Also, you are not the only one who decides if a law is just or unjust. There's 300 million other people ~~you have to live with~~ who have to live with *you* in this country, and they get some say in what you can and can't do. If you're only going to follow the laws that *you* think are just, then you deserve any fines or jailtime you get.
Am I a fan of the war on drugs? No. Do I think marajuana use should mandate jailtime? No. Do I think the police tactics for enforcing drinking laws are a bit predatory? Perhaps.
But laws exist for a reason. The police keep us safe. So if you're going to break the law, you ought to have a *damn* good reason. If you don't, don't expect any sympathy from me when you face the consequences that you should've known about before you broke them.

Yeah, no. I put a survet up on a while ago to get a sense of what that subreddit is. Here's the picture I got from it: most of the people there actually like bitcoin, or have no problem with it. They just in general hate (as in this community) for a variety of reasons. The community as a whole had a pretty diverse set of opinions. The only thing they had in common was that they thought buttcoin headlines were *hilarious*.
And to be honest, alot of their criticisms of community are pretty valid. There's a lot of shit that gets said in this community that's worth making fun of. Because it's stupid. Like this.

The point is that this other crypto currencies, the miners wouldn't *have* to charge fees. So the miners get paid in either currency, but other currencies could be more attarctive because of lower transaction costs.
While it's doubtful that the transaction costs will ever be significantly high, or high enough to warreent switching currencies, it is something to consider.

It's only when that database has users willing to trade other things with value for those tokens that the tokens get value.
The technology the network is based upon, though, necessarily has value. And that value is due to the "useful implications" that you speak of.

This is one reason why I'm worried about a 51% attack after the reward halving. Suddenly, about 50% of people are going to find it unprofitable to mine. Many of those will sell their miners for extremely reduced prices. Then if someone who already has a lot of equipment buys a whole bunch of cheap asics, they now have the tools to do a 51% attack if they wish.
I'm not saying that it will happen, but it is a serious concern.

Banning bitcoin isn't banning the math behind bitcoin. It's banning the communications with the rest of the bitcoin network. You can calculate hashes all day long, but it's the part where you send messages that represent bitcoins to other people that's illegal.

I'm trying to say that they broke the law, and it's not like they had any noble motivation. They just wanted to have fun. And that's not a reason to break the law.
Also, I've never heard of a police officer punishing someone for underage drinking with violence. Not saying it never happens, but it certainly isn't the norm. Police officers generally don't use violence unless there's some immediate threat to their or someone else's safety. When they do, they're some of the bad cops.

Except these people who are complaining about getting ticketed for drinking underage obviously aren't "willingly accept[ing] the penalty of imprisonment" or other punishment. If they were, they should stop complaining that they are getting ticketing.
If you're going to choose to break the law by drinking underage, I don't really care. But don't go complaining that you have to pay a ticket because you got caught. Suck it up, because you broke the law.
And if you're going to protest drinking laws with civil disobedience, I don't think that getting drunk is the way to do that.

Full nodes get rewards if they mine a block. It's just easier/cheaper to mine in a pool if your only goal is mining, so most miners don't run full nodes. And most full nodes sometimes don't mine because they don't want to run as hot, and don't have reasonable chances of mining a block.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:29:28
Well, you could have a blockchain where miners got non-transferable tokens of value (perhaps for some voting application) as a reward for mining, and I suppose theoretically that could work. In that case since the tokens are non-transferrable, it's essentially impossible for them to be a currency, but the blockchain could still work as a ledger. But I'm not sure what kind of value you could imbue into the tokens to make a large enough incentive to secure the blockchain, if the tokens can't be traded.

I didn't say "regulate fraud." I implied that fraud can be committed with bitcoin (see mtGox, numerous gambling sites that scammed their users, etc).

You learn in any economics 101 course that banks can (and do) create money. I don't see how this is news to anyone.
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:57:20
Well, kinda. If something has the potential to break the law, it's definitely worth considering regulations on it. For example, guns. You can have guns and be a perfectly law abiding citizen. It's not against the law. But there's things you can do with guns that can break the law, and hurt other people, like shooting someone. It make sense, then, to limit the freedoms of people trying to own guns, to some degree, if we can effectively stop people from getting shot. The same logic works for cars (we make regulations to try to stop people from crashing into each other), construction (we make regulations to stop shoddily built buildings from killing people), industry (we make regulations to stop people from dumping poisons in rivers).
Not everything that has ever been used to do something illegal needs to be regulated though. For instance, I could burn someone with a hair straightener. Do they need to be regulated? Not really. It's fairly rare that people use hair straighteners as weapons, and the inconvenience of extreme regulations on hair straighteners does more harm than good.
It's the tools that are most powerful, and the most prevalently used in illegal actions that need to be regulated. I think most people here would agree that bitcoin is a powerful tool for the transfer of value. There is also a history of crimes that have been committed with bitcoin, although how common the crimes are is up to debate. I can't say I've researched bitcoin enough to know what regulations would be effective at stopping crime, and to what extent they should be regulated. But based on what I know about bitcoin, existence of *some* regulations actually makes a lot of sense.
I don't mean to say that everybody who owns bitcoins has to report all their private keys to the state or be arrested. That would be kinda ridiculous. But perhaps monitoring the identity of people who make large conversions between bitcoin and other currencies isn't such a bad idea. Do you like the idea a a rich banker buying 4.5 million in bitcoin every year to evade 2 million of taxes? I don't. And if there absolutely no regulations on bitcoin, how do we stop it?
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:09:21
You could give any particular bitcoin address as an example of one you couldn't generate. Even addresses that already have been generated can't be generated again without the private key. If you could prove me wrong you could also steal any bitcoin anywhere.

You can look at all the transaction addresses that sent you bitcoins after you reached the threshold, and send back the same amount of bitcoins back that you received. Hopefully whoever sent those bitcoins would have access to the private key they used to send them.

But anyway, even if they did not return the coins, they should at the very least voluntarily freeze them and not use them to fund this current campaign.

I hope the consensus here is that the pirate party should return those bitcoins to their original send addresses. If not, you guys are a bunch of hypocrites, because I *know* you all hate it when political parties get huge campaign contributions that allow them to unfairly win because of the power of well funded advertising.

Oh, so you don't mind huge private campaign contributions? Would you say that you don't mind it when large corporations and very rich people influence public policy by funding politicians? If so, you're not much like most redditors.

idk, maybe read or ask more about it here:  ? I'm not really following it closely.

The only way I'd trust anonymity is if I got bitcoin from a public merchant using cash and never told him my name (or any other identifying info).

They probably will. And are. The MtGox fiasco is being investigated in Japan, because that's where there's jurisdiction if I recall correctly. I'm not sure about bitstamp, but I'm sure law enforcement has at least been notified.

People do. All the time. Every mining facility and probably many full nodes are hit with DDoS attacks constantly. But no one can take them all out at once.

People don't want to send bitcoins immediately to people with cards because of chargebacks and other risks. Too many scammers with stolen CC info try to buy BTC.

Generally, that's done by the police with a warrant. The way you get the police to do this for you is you file a police report. You might not have much luck with that given the nature of bitcoin, though. But it all depends on the circumstances.

Obvious Ponzi. Look, you posted about this 4 days ago, when it was claiming to give 7.2% hourly, but now it's .3% hourly. You're never going to get your money back.
