Actually, nowadays it's non-custodial; a multisig with the customer holding two of the keys. There was a problem with one specific app version a while back and they required the affected customers move their coins to a new wallet as they had no way of doing the transfer themselves.

Apparently I had a bad config on my node - feel tree to give it another try at some point...

The drop came just after it became possible to short BTC at US exchanges, so it's quite possible the majority of sellers initially were not the owners but short sellers. In fact, this downward trend in price development due to introduction of shorting to BTC was quite reasonable to expect as before it had mostly been acquired by long term holders.
See for example: [

No worries, I sent it in PM (as requested). Here's it again

And here's mine - [
No Tor yet though, so not possible to connect directly to the aforementioned one. Maybe I should to try to set that  up as well at some point.

Received - cheers :) 
Hope you get the site to work in a stable manner, sounds like an interesting concept!
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:10:46
It should be reachable, and it has sent and received number of transfers today already... Weird. 
Maybe some interoperability issue between different daemons? Running clightning.

Doesn't seem to work, just invoices for 1000 sat and nothing happens afterwards.
Inspecting the page it seems that clicking 'click to open wallet' generates a payment and then directly disconnects the websocket due to `SubscribeInvoiceCoroutine(): Websocket Error: Abnormal disconnection.`
It might work with the QR code (no idea about that), as the disconnect happens only after clicking the button.

You might be onto something, it has only outgoing connections active atm. Will dig into this.

Haha, my bad, didn't remember chat and PM are different things at Reddit.

Apparently they cant: `v5cf4vscslwguto5axvg6egcjmmkktw7tz4yf3wu352ngnqjyrbe6uqd.onion:9735: opening -1 socket gave Protocol not supported.`
Maybe there is an option to enable both Tor and normal network?
My node was just set up a few days ago, managed to install bitcoind and clightning to run in the cloud, and added some 50 euros worth to ln to test it out (not too much in case it loses it or gets hacked). Seems quite interesting technology so far.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:27:54
Interesting to see if they ever return the money or if we were just owned.
@_date: 2019-08-25 13:04:17
Sure, let's give it a try.
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:29:40
Yeah, I had a bad bind address \*rolls eyes\*
Should be online now! Thanks for the info!

Ah, I was wondering why it didn't work. First time trying it too :D

Got the payment already, cheers!

Good idea! Here's a sample invoice if I managed to generate it right:
And here's the same invoiced amount back via lntipbot (it's a good way to start)

Apparently they can, as it was the case in this block. Maybe the first transactions had higher fee to ensure they would be processed before the latter ones? Might check that later when not on the move.

It looks like someone split 100BTC from two circa 54,568 BTC holdings multiple times in the same block, and thus the block total looks huge but it’s mostly the same coins being used in multiple transactions.
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:55:00
My understanding from the block explorer looks like; A paying 100BTC to X, putting leftover in B. Then B paying 100BTC to Y, putting leftover to C. etc. In the same block. So multiple transactions from the same initial coins, but no multispent as the address and remainder changes after each transaction.

Some weeks ago.

I mistakingly made one transfer without a fee. It was mined in 5 hours.

USR came out with HST (14.4k) in 1989, and the ITU specs for V.32bis are from 1991, so I think 14k was mainstream well before 94 - I had one in my BBS in the early 90s and I bought it used from a large corporate BBS when they were upgrading their equipment, so it wasn't brand new back then.

I thought (that I was sure), but I was on the move when answering so didn't check it. Those linked above seemed quite a bit larger so I doubt mine was within that list. Trying to remember  what I moved and where when that happened, so I could go back to double check.
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:05:21
Yeah I was a bit scared when I noticed what had happened, but luckily it didn’t hang in the limbo forever. Apparently some miners are nice enough to include some free transactions if the block has space available.
