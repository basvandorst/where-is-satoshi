PR doesn't have to be the in your face press release. They make sure their directors are appearing in all relevant magazines/newspapers (not Bitcoin necessarily -- could be finance or whatever). They make the company look good for some future buyout

I'm here because I subscribe - not sure what that has to do with me knowing ppl that do/don't know about bitcoin. Most people I know in real life don't even use reddit.

Don't change the 'I's for 'We's. I'm a freelancer like you. Your clients will only ever meet you, and you'll look daft when they ask "So who else works here"
@_date: 2015-06-05 12:33:56
No they don't. No millennials I know have ever heard of or used bitcoin. Also, that's not what the guy said. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:34:57
I think initially its best to be honest. On my site I spell out I do design, dev, digital marketing but work with others where necessary.

I don't think helping online tipping is of interest to 99% of the population. I also think 99% of the population don't use or know about browser plugins.

remove the link to your website til you actually have something there. and take 'bandwagon' out your username, there's nothing positive associated with that word. and no one know what BTC means. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 15:58:10
Do clients have any problems paying in bitcoin? I've had to jump through hoops (initially, and when hitting limits) when getting signed up on exchanges.

Definitely. I remember trying to clear out my Mach3 with bits of paper or the end of the toothpaste tube! Must... get... one... more... shave!
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:23:19
Nice one cheers. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 19:55:42
I've tweeted a couple times about bitcoin discount (previously 5%)... I'll try again but I've not had much interest so far. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:42:06
Sorry about that. I messed up the settings (shipping, free shipping, international shipping). Just tested now and free shipping should appear after you select US. If you make it back to the checkout page... Thanks! 
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:18:13
Cheers. Someone else pointed that out too, fixed now. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:42:37
i deleted those messages, assumed you'd be asleep!

Maybe momentary blip (cheap hosting). Seems to be fine now, cheers
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:18:46
Cheers for the prompt. Have fixed. It's still not that prominent though... I'll look for ways to introduce it round the site. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:08:37
I offer 5% off with bitcoin - traditional shaving products (safety razors, shaving bowls, shaving brushes, razor blades) [gentified.co.uk]( 
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:02:20
Put notice at top of page. Good point tho ... Will fix 
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:21:42
Oh god who thought it would be a good idea for devs to manage the copy on a website
@_date: 2015-08-15 13:01:01
They're both good, both look and feel good, both get good reviews. It's just down to personal style. I guess I prefer the Muhle (black handle) -- a more traditional feel. They both are about the same size and weight too. Free shipping over £40 which you could so easily if you throw in some razor blades. You'd probably find that amount would last you months! I use a blade for 2 shaves, others online 4 or 5 times.

Bitcoin hasn't become a preferred method there. It's an alternative. Trading bananas is an alternative too. Let's not get excited just yet.
@_date: 2015-09-06 13:50:20
My comment was more a poke at the shit OP title than bitcoin. It hasn't become "the preferred alternative".

How much does client owe? There are loads of hoops to jump through in buying BTC on the sites I've tried and more hoops (ID docs) when you get to bigger figures. Or am I missing something. You're right - I want to know the answer so I can start billing people X thousand GBP for a website and get sent BTC (without the hoops for client). 
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:33:42
Get a sense of humour you idiot. I like Bitcoin as much as the next dude. It was a joke ... Ya know, because the main stream media think it's used by criminals. Never mind.
@_date: 2015-10-10 10:50:18
I joined the party too late to profit but buy and spend when I can. Do you just plan on using your bitcoin as a savings account to dip into whenever you need or will you watch the price long term and sell at some point (high or low I guess)
@_date: 2016-05-04 07:48:10
Won't his Gov turn around and ask for tax on that income at some point... I think that'll sort this thing out. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:35:16
Best part was it was a friggin joke. People so touchy around here. I actually like Bitcoin and want it to succeed. Everyone wets their panties when you joke about it here

Correct. That's the only way I read it. Maybe it's Brit sarcasm that others didn't get.
