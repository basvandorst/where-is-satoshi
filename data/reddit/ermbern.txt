So? They are allowed to. It’s a democracy isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:01:27
I want socialism
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:51:42
So you’re saying that this whole conversation is unverifiable?
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:56:12
I’m not a socialist. I’m a communist.
Why are you, an epic gamer, not calling someone the n word right now?

Opiate epidemic is not cause by immigration. It’s cause by the pharmaceutical industry.
And illegal immigrants and drug addicts don’t usually vote so I don’t know what the fuck your on about.
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:11:06
Oh, so it’s not about illegal immigration. Just Latino voters, got it, masks off.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:38:53
It’s a debate whether they are voting in elections as illegal immigrants, yes.

So, you’re saying that after many splits, one of btc branches will control 30% of the market in about 100 years?
Don’t know if at&amp;t is a good example.
@_date: 2019-07-18 21:15:30
Yeah well that’s fucking stupid.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:55:56
By ‘dreamers’ and ‘anchor babies’ do you mean to say ‘citizens’?
You motherfuckers are coming awfully close to saying citizens shouldn’t be able to vote if the are the descendants of immigrants.
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:38:14
But it has been overstated so many times. 
I honestly don’t know what you expect to change if money becomes decentralized tomorrow.

Israel should never have been created.
Why are you people anti-globalism but pro-imperialism?
@_date: 2017-07-01 04:26:35
Gross 
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:55:33
I'm down voting you just cause you are really unlikable. You are insufferable.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:32:50
Me? You are the one drawing analogies between satoshi and fucking Prometheus.
The difference is it didn't take Prometheus a decade or longer to convince people of the value of fire. In no way has satoshi stolen fire from the gods. If he did we wouldn't be talking about crypto solely in terms of fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:23:38
Hyperbole much?
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:20:26
If you learned to trade you wouldn't start this way.
Don't ever do this.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:54:36
Stop confusing civics and economics. If a type of economics isn't sustainable when everyone is looking out for  then it's not sustainable.

"Very intellectually heavy" 
Sick burn, retard.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:24:58
Stop telling people what to do you god damn commie.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:36:31
You have changed the moral. I thought the moral was that one person stole control from the authorities. Now it's a moral about society not appreciating genius? I thought everyone appreciated Prometheus instantly.
@_date: 2017-06-28 23:54:15
Lol fuck off
@_date: 2017-06-28 15:32:17
I'm in my 30s
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:53:07
Is it an analogy or a metaphor? Is it about rebellion or about ignored genius? 
Get your shit together cause you don't know what you are talking about you ridiculous, hyperbolic, ignorant little tool. Also, learn how to write complete fucking sentences.
