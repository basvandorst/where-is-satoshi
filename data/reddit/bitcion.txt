I have been bag holding bitcoin since the ~~600s back in 2013. Essentially have ignored everything going on with it up until this point. I actually logged on for the first time since May 2016 just to check on how things were going on the day of the hack.

Since the IRS has no guidance on this I would pay taxes when exchanging from Bit to fiat I  am just putting it like any other stock sold on my taxes with reporting category C (No 1098 received). Wash sales don't apply since only stocks and others are regulated by that. 
Some people say it is too complicated with both guidance to even report it. It could be considerd a foreign currency or maybe a capital gains. I would say putting Bitcoin on your tax return will surely get more attention by the IRS so that they may get guidance to us. 
If you do file you will need Schedule D and 8949. Standard tax docs if you trade stocks, ETFs et al. 
There is a site that can help you import your trades to make them formatted for Schedule D amd 8949.

First, this is from the ripoffreport which while a good place to look is open to the whole internet. 
The reason Coinbase cancels these is because ACH transfers are easily reversible. So people would be able to send away Bitcoins when the prices drop dramatically. Then try to dispute the charge which would tie up the whole Coinbase team.

That is called quantitative easing. Lots of government bond buying by the central bank. 
I haven't had any problems with Ally yet. I still use credit card, but not that often. I do shop on Amazon a lot but I tend to buy with gift cards. 
Your local bank could have filed a SAR since lots of transfers are happening. Nothing unusual unless they start freezing your account. At that point I would leave if they start doing that.

There are many things wrong with a government backed currency. For one the government would like squabble for months to agree on things like premine, distribution and the like.
Quite a few people would likely just follow whatever currency the government throw at them and we would see worthless dollars all over the streets. Supporters would argue that the govt. is more "trustworthy" than Bitcoin. Even when peer-to-peer is a more secure system than any government built system.
The thing that might convert people would be the promise that there money is backed by gold.

I based the Fib retracements on the swing highs and the swing lows. I did not even try to shape the Fib retracement into the data. I didn't even notice that there were times when the Fib lines were actually meet until I examined the chart closely. They are the the based on having two lower highs or lows on the right of the middle.
Although, using the the 1 day chart I am not able to get the absolute perfect swing high and lows, but they are close enough. Also, when the market goes really low really fast it is quite possible for it to at some time later retrace just as low. If it will play out that is what I will like to see.

I actually comment on this sort of stuff on Cryptocoinnews with their analysis. Mainly it is due to them having half ass TA, but I have in general noticed their bearish stance for quite some time. I did not know that they actually changed their predictions after the fact. A rather tactless move on their part as it makes them seem less honest.
The one evidence you could have gotten was to look at the web cache or do a wayback machine snapshot as soon as the article is published.

They probably filed a SAR since you have had so much money move between them.

In all seriousness, most of the people outside of the market know nothing about the technology behind this or the implications. They think it is just a meme like Dogecoin. These people are what we call the late adopters. Once we see companies like Goldman Sachs getting into the market more people will realize it is more than just a fad. 
The reasoning behind the value going up and more people distrusting it is a statement that is not well thought out. The value going higher only makes it much less likely for it to fall to $0 as we are always going to have buyers ready to snatch up some cheap coin.

That is the same reason that I stayed away from Mt. Gox was that they didn't have fast withdrawals.

Mt. Gox is not "who" but a "what". That being said Mt. Gox is an exchange that most trusted to trade Bitcoins. These Bitcoins likely were stored when people made deposits to trade. Another possibility is that this could have been a commission fee wallet but not as likely.

Incorrect; all BTC transactions are broadcast on the blockchain. So when you withdrew from say Localbitcoin you would give them the address the device generates. Transaction is broadcast it to all nodes. Miners process transaction and it is now in your wallet. 
The address isn't really "private" or "public" they are just simply addresses. Now not sending BTC from a new addresses means your public key wouldn't be seen until you make a transaction. I guess you'd call private addresses "offline."

I think it is a confirmation bias on most people who are pessimistic about Bitcoin. They always try to find someway to show us how Bitcoin is "unregulated" and "has the potential for illegal activities." Yet,  cash never seems to get as much blame.

Spotting a reversal is one of the hardest things, because there may be many times where the market will fakeout. Basically going up then with positive signs then heading back down. 
Reversal signs could be reaching a certain level, or having the market not react at all to heavy selling where it may flash crash, but then regain much higher beyond the initial point of crash.
When I bought above 300 I did so via Circle. It was meant to be an extremely short term buy where I could make profit rather quickly. Yet, because Circle decided to flag the transaction I wasn't able to sell out. All signs pointed down and I knew that. I haven't looked at the charts and I really don't care right now since I'm busy with other stuff, but I could have looked at them. Off the top off my head the market seems really overextended right now with the massive sell pressure. Going up is bound to happen if we stay steady for a few days. Unless of course more dumping happens. Yet, we would still be in highly oversold area.

Well in my case sending $0.5 in any other method would be impractical. Now that is really where Bitcoin shines.
Yes, they may need the money now, but even if they accecpt Visa or Mastercard those still have some time to wait.
The only problem right now is that they are new to Coinbase so it does take time to verify that. After that turnaround time is much quicker.
Only a few methods are actually faster at getting real *cash* into peoples hands, but cost more to send or receive (Western Union or Paypal). 
I understand the point that you are driving at.

They are on the move because they are moving form wallet to wallet. What is happening is that they are trying to remove taint on the wallet back to the original address by moving Bitcoins constantly. Although, transfers to empty wallets over and over really doesn't hide the origin.

The people who didn't panic sell out would be sitting on giant stockpiles of Bitcoin. I do not think many have big piles from then. Now bag holding when it recently crashed down is now likely. 
It is *silly* to say that selling coins bought at 1000+ would be sold. Must be the way your past is worded. Because this assumes everyone made the right choice and sold out at the top. The just recently bought in (don't know many who wouldn't just blow through that money).
If suddenly Bitcoin dropped in value in a flash crash then yes most miners would leave thus making transactions slower, but that is a temporary problem as difficulty recalculates. The may be less buyers but with them being so cheap there would be those willing to toss say $1 or two since it isn't that much of a loss. This assumes it *never* recovers. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:14:19
I think it is based off looking at the long term log charts if I am correct. No one knows where Bitcoin will go but if you want to risk it go ahead and put $200 in.

To show your support to Bitcoin just introduce people to it made buy with it. More companies will take notice and think about it. Furthermore, since tax guidance is non existent in the US and about many other countries it would be a challenge for global companies like Walmart to want to accept Bitcoin. They have to worry about double taxation of when they receive profits then use those profits for wages or dividends to shareholders. I think if the IRS would give guidance companies would be more willing to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon.

I would think the the blockchain technology would the greatest asset because without it how would be verify transactions to make sure they aren't counterfeit or in anyway double spent. Bitcoin would not have survived without the blockchain. It is an essential competent that we see replicated over all altcoins.
When you ask yourself what is the one constant to just about every alt you would say the blockchain.
Now if we are talking crypto versus just crypto than I guess the amount of merchants and developers for Bitcoin is greater than most of the others. Because it takes a village to build town and an army to protect. Ok, I don't know where I am going with this.

 have never bought a TA book and do just fine trading. No one should buy a TA book unless it is free. 
I have done TA and it is essential to look at as if I had bought at certain times I would not have seen a clear downward trend starting. 
I know enough about TA not to completely misread what it's telling me. Now the charts I have made I carefully look at and combine any days events while also looking towards what i think may happen. Then I see if the indicators support what I think. I combine many at once to get a better picture. 
Sometimes I get a gut feeling where even if Stoch looks like it is going up I predicted that it was instead peaking. Which it did and prices resumed on there way. 
One of my recent charts if you want to see how I do TA. I don't add fundamental analysis since it is rather hard to gauge if people will just overact to news or not. Clearly trends can be seen in term, but longer term charts are better for stating those views.

If I remember it died around May 2011 where it flatlined for quite some time. Then again we saw the April crash. Seems like MT. Gox still is the center of a Bitcoin downward trend. 
Now as for being really dead, no. We all still believe in the groundbreaking, earth shattering power Bitcoin has. This is just your typical FUD crash back to normal levels. Lots of newbies think they never are emotional when trading, but when they see one unrealized loss they tend to panic. It starts cascading like it is now. 
Bitcoin has its flaws but a centralized exchange having problems is rather good for BTC. The more we can get exchanges like Bitsimple the better.

For one, the reason the mods banned price quotes in the r/bitcoin subred it because it doesn't belong here. Nobody needs a price update when you can easily get it from live charts. There is also a reddit for bitcoin market talk. r/Bitcoin is meant for news or the like in discussion.
This sub reddit is full of people who will likely down vote this entire post because they believe Bitcoin will go to the moon. Anything to the contrary will just be voted down. They just want to hear what they want to hear. 
I really hope for Bitcoin being able to adpat but even if there is an update to fix the big flaws it would have to be slowly pushed out. Don't put more in then you can loss at this point. No one can be certain of Bitcoin's future.
The 51% attack is concerning to me. Bitcoin was meant to be decentralized. I am curious if Sasthoshi Nakamoto would take action to add more computers to the mining pool. Comments like this: ( make people not understand the implications of one pool having 51%.

Well to start off some of these exchanges are halting withdrawals because they do not want someone pulling all the Bitcoin out. Other exchanges, like CampBX, halted because their bank does not like Bitcoin transactions. 
It all comes down to Bitcoin exchanges are centralized which goes against the very nature of the decentralization of Bitcoin.
More exchanges like Bitsimple are needed.

That is the problem with Dogecoin. They are passing around a "silly toy currency" and not taking it seriously. How can you base any currency like that if it is, so to speak, paper money.
I don't think the "culture of Bitcoin" really matters when you like at currencies like the Chinese Yen. They are a suppressed state where freedoms and liberties are little.

I had the same problem with them 2 days ago. What I don't understand is how I'm suddenly flagged when I've done $2,200 with them previously all of which were instant and all which I sent BTC out to external as quick as possible. I haven't had any problems up until the price dipped dramatically. If they are out of Bitcoin they need to halt transactions, or at least let you cancel if you can't get it right away.
BTW, my transaction that got flagged was for $480. I got support to clear it next day, but come on. I'm basically holding Bitcoin that wasn't meant to be held this long. 
When it cleared yesterday I tried to send my Bitcoin to cold storage since the cost I bought at is a bit above market value at the time. I kept having problems with trying to send, and instead I was getting messages that "Price changed too much." Really? I was trying to send a fixed BTC amount of 1.4... I don't care if the price changed since it's a fixed amount. Ugh...

The trend has been downwards in Bitcoin for weeks with no signs of reversals. That is about the clearest thing I've seen so far. Other than that it is always a gamble as to when whales sell out.

This is why I mainly stay away from this sub. Mainly people who do not have any reasoning.
I have done lots of TA that has played out. Some may play out and some won't. The thing everyone needs to understand is that TA is not a one all. I did a post on this in the other sub about hierarchy. Basically goes Fundamentals &gt; Sentiment &gt; TA. You always listen to the either fudamentals or sentiment first. To those who do not believe TA have a look at some of my charts. 
Again, not all play out but that is TA. Don't understand why it is so easily discredited when it is a tool. Would you trust your neighbor to weld a plane? Likely not unless they do that for a living. It is the same, well sort of, with me. I know what I do in TA and the majority of people haven't the clue. You have to know what is good TA from bad.
It also astounds me sometimes on the other sub that people always upvote either the most basic of TAs (lines and happy triangles) and the ones that get posted daily. There are some good daily posts sure, but sometimes they are rather basic.
Also, those who do not believe in TA likely think it is to "caters to the get-quick-rich people." Which is untrue as there are many times where an indicator like Stoch or RSI go into OVERBOUGHT but the price never follows through. What is get rich quick is the pump and dumps seen in alts all the time.
Well sorry for my rant person I replied to. One of the reasons I try to stay away from is the lack of knowledge on how TA works. If anyone of them just took a second to read about it they would understand that nothing in TA is 100%. That is why we have **stop-loss and take profit orders**.

For me cashing out in USD is rather easy. I can use Coinbase if I wanted have money directly deposited in my account. CampBX, before it had bank problems, did allow me to ACH out from them.
I would have to pull me coins out of storage so there would be that slight delay as the Confirms will take some about an hour. 
You can think of Bitcoin as complimenting any fiat currency. I mean it is rather cheap to send $15k (or what ever the conversation rate is) for pennies.

Well you can say we quote the Euro/USD or any other currencies for that matter. Everything is quoted in dollars when trading or handing out BTC for goods as the $ is still king.  People will still value the $ as they know it is "stable" and is "back by the government."
You can also look at it this way. iPhones have a know and fixed ratio. In theory if iPhones were used as a currency people would likely quote the price between that and USD. Since there are some who really do not want an iPhone and would rather have the cash.

CampBX does not require verification. They currently are in process of setting up ACH deposits but withdrawls work. Commissions are not the best at 0.55% 10% of commisions with ref link so that is kinda of nice.   Although, it is easier and may be cheaper to get money out of CampBX other exchanges like BTC-e have better rates. Just that putting money in can be expensive unless you buy from different exchange and send BTC deposit.

CampBX or Coinase if you are in the US. Coinbase does have higher fees but atm has ACH. CampBX should have ACH deposits soon but only ACH withdraws are enabled. The difference between Coinbase and CampBX is that Coinbase you have to buy at market value, it takes time for money to go in or out. CampBX once the money is in your account you can trade at will with limit orders and the like.

You can buy from Localbitcoins. That is quick, yet not quickest.
What I can think of is CampBX.  If they had ACH enabled (should be soon) you could send money there anytime you want. Does take time to arrive, but once it does you can buy sell as quick as you want. In this downward trend if I could I would send money to CampBX and let it sit until the right time to buy. One great thing is taht you don't need to buy BTC right away unlike Coinbase which you have to buy BtC at the current market price.

The one problem with this is that you are holding money in a foreign account which in it of its self requires declerations etc. Not to mention that transferring money out would still be a process as I think they don't use the standard ACH or SEPA as those are region specefic.

It is harder to get money into BTC-e. There are exchanges but fees really add up. That is why I would not personally use it. Wire transfers I am not so sure about.

I remember mining back in the day 5/2011 on a pooled mining site. Made about 0.015 BTC in 3 days on a Nvidia 9500 GT lol. Electricity costs really kept me away from mining non stop and with that PoS GPU I didn't think I would be able to mine much later. Crazy!

Wow that wallet has over $100,000,000 at todays rates. Crazy!
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:13:59
Wow there are a lot who think it is going to drop. The problem with that is that they think it will drop so low. I think if it does drop that it would be 50% drop of what it is today. There will be some strong support lines even when it does fall plus the US is not the main factor in deciding if BTC is worth it. That's what some are failing to understand in the ethnocentric culture.
I personally would not wait to buy in by BF as we could likely pass the all time high by that time. I will have to see what the indicators say, but I think we are going to blow past this ATH soon.

CampBX  does not require any personal information to buy and sell Bitcoins. Although, their are limits for withdrawal. CampBX has been around for some time and is based in Georgia. I have been using it myself and have not had many problems.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:26:59
One thing I can say. Bitcoin moves at a much faster rate then any fiat currency. So you may have to look at shorter time periods to see trends etc.
Also, if you want some more advice
 is very helpful.
@_date: 2013-11-28 02:02:24
Well that is true but I am in it to make more BTC and USD at the same time. You can keep one for a long time or trade and make 2 BTC.
Yet if you are just going to save it might as well hold onto it in an offline wallet for a year and see what prices are after that.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:18:41
I wish they did not have Auto withdraw. Really annoying getting a bunch of small payments only to have to pay so much in miner fees because of the transaction size.

If you have Bitcoin dust now it won't get you to be a millionaire. Now if you had a 1 BTC then you just might. Who knows with today's prices. Could take a dive or keep on going.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:28:07
Just buy a few of each right now. 
BTC is right now in a sideways market where the highs and low are getting smaller by the hour. They are eventually going to breakout from this and continue to rise.
LTC has been increasing rapidly. Just put $100 in and hold onto it for about a few months. I am sure prices will reach $20+
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:21:37
Depends on exactly where you are in the world. Mt Gox is horrible for US withdraws as they take months to arrive. Coinbase  is pretty reliable and has ACH in and out. Does cost 1% commission plus $0.15 bank fee both ways so that adds up. 
If you live in the SEPA zone Bitstamp is good for deposits and withdraws bitstamp.net. Way more expensive if you anywhere in the rest of the world because of the wire fee.
The last one that I mainly use is CampBX   Can ACH for $2 and commissions are only 0.55%. Not as much volume but if you live in the US it can be a whole lot cheaper then Coinbase 1% fee and waiting for funds to arrive.

@_date: 2013-12-08 03:07:36
The price was more then just the news or Fontas. It was being over bought for weeks which caused an inflated price. Just like the crash back in April people say that the price was increasing everyday and thought: "Well this is going to the moon. I better buy in." Now it is: "We are going straight to the bottom."  
I had been watching the news and checking the charts and long term I had been worried that it was being overbought for weeks. Really worried when the overbought signal started turn south towards selling. Which at that point the price fell.

This is the day's old question everyone  asks. It is not your fault for not knowing, but Mt Gox will take forever to get money out of. Many see the price difference and think they can make a quick buck. In reality there is a reason for the price difference.
You can buy on Bitstamp and sell on Localbitcoins to people. Privacy always adds a premium to the selling price.

There is always one in the bunch who thinks that Bitcoin is a commodity for our frequent use of the USD quotes. OP needs to realize that we are still in an infancy of our currency right now. If OP went outside this reddit it would realize that cash is still king. Prices are usually automatically converted over to USD. OP needs to come back after doing more reserach.

Does not know about Bitpay.


Who? Apple? Amazon? eBay?


Which at this moment is around $700.


Based on what? The fact that China's rumor started the downward trend? The fact that you just can't understand it and think it should be worth $10?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:37:33
From what I have been seeing in the charts/indicators and news it is not such the greatest time to buy in. Still have very bearish signs still in place which are going to take place over the next few days. I am going to give it at least until Monday to decide if and when to go in. At this very moment I am thinking the price is going to slowly fall back down to support levels again. I would say you can put like $100 down now and see where that takes you.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:08:45
It does not mean it is one person. It can be several trying to push the price down. Also, I am not going to buy right now based on the lack of any information as to why to buy.

@_date: 2013-11-27 05:33:52
You are getting the general idea of how Bitcoin works. Bitcoin isn't really mined in the internet. It is mined within computers and broadcast to the internet to all the nodes. In a sense if we created a Bitnet that was independent from the internet then that is what all nodes would listen on for the blocks that are "mined." Mining is basically bruteforcing a SHA-256 has which header must be smaller then the current difficulty level.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:53:32

We have quite a ways more to go down before we see the bottom. Right now MT Gox just went below 600 after being highly inflated by dolphins (BTC owners with 300+ BTC.) 
Lower 500s and upper 400s seem possible now.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:50:15
Thinking we have hit the bottom of the downward trend for now. We are breaking out so this could be a good time to buy some BTC. I know I am getting more BTC now so that is always a plus.
May swing down to ~800 tonight, but it did break through. Going to buy about $100 of coin and see how I do.

In all honesty you can make some if you do a pooled mining, but it will take quite some time before you get enough. Difficulty is only going up so it will soon require more powerful rigs in the future. Something to keep in mind.

Yeah I did the same a while back. I bought right October 1st and a few more a week later. 3 BTC total. Sold out before the bear trap, but didn't get back in. Kept waiting think it would level off. 
What I do now is any profits I making trading I set aside some BTC for long term 1+ year storage. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:44:36
Coinbase is great for buying, but CampBX is planning on doing ACH transfers for $2 fixed. That is much cheaper if you are trying to buy 0.25 BTC at todays current prices. Plus you don't need to wait once you sell BTC.
I have been using Coinbase and have had a problem with them in October. I had sold BTC, but for some reason the sell did not go through and did not even appear on my history. The BTC got returned to my account. The price was even higher so I guess that was good for me. Contacted support and I think they said they didn't know why it was cancelled, but they could see my transaction history that I sold.
Haven't had any problems buying from them. Selling I did have problems 1 weeks ago. The ACH transfer was supposed to arrive Wednesday, yet it got delayed for 2 days. This was around the time the site was experiencing DDoS on Monday so that delayed things.
Anyways, CampBX versus Coinbase. Coinbase: Fees 1% plus $0.15. CampBX: Fees $2 ACH in then 0.55% on each trade  unless you get referral code and it goes down to 0.45%. Since CampBX is in process of setting up their ACH in I buy from Coinbase and send to CampBX.

That only effects transactions. It has nothing to do with Bitcoins prices. It is the max transaction size per block. Right now we are about 1/2 of that for most blocks.
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:33:15
I have been using Coinbase since October. It is fine as long as there isn't sudden price swings then they have bad latency. 
It is secure as they store BTC in cold wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:50:18
I could see it going up to this by end of next year. If you own at least 1 BTC you are in the top 1%. That is why when I invest I put some towards a no touch wallet for long term storage.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:34:14
Well it is their lose if they do not make mad millions or lose $100. I know I wouldn't put all my money in BTC and if you are like me you day trade. Helps prevent lose.
Bitcoin is not something for the faint of heart. Most think they can just get in and make a ton of money, but with the market going up and down all the time you have to know when to sell and buy again.

10 Bitcents each (0.1 BTC) would set them up nicely. If a uBTC is worth $0.01 in the future then 1 mBtc would be worth $10. 10 Bitcents would be worth $1000. BTC would then be worth $10k.

CampBX. You really don't need to verify to send any money in. You could send in money via Money Orders or buy Bitcoins and send them in. ACH is about to be setup soon. Looked through the terms and there is nothing about age limits.
There are limits of $1000 per day withdrawals and deposits, but other then that don't need to give all you private info away. Just need username, password and email for the restricted account.
10% discount of CampBX commissions for signing up via a ref link.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:02:54
It is high risk since you can easily reverse an ACH transaction and get the money back while sending Bitcoins somewhere else. They do this often when there are dramatic price drops.

High risk? You bet. Likely to pay off? Most certainly. I cannot predict the markets, but when you think about it you know your dollar will buy you much less 2 years from now. I think once people like investors get in the price will be very high. Who knows we could be down for all I know.

Impossible really to invest in a savings account that promises high rates. Alsok because of the limited availability of Bitcoin you cannot turn a mBTC to BTC just by holding it into one of these. The risk is high as they exchange the money. Really isn't a way to make bitcoin without the risk.

As more people come to see Bitcoins potential they start buying in. Highly overvalued? That is something the market will decide. But with the limited supply of Bitcoins that is every going to exist then it likely will continue this exponential growth for at least 1-2 years before leveling off. We are just in a deflationary period.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:44:47
I don't think it will have a negative effect on the prices because if people are buying more from merchants than that just solidifies Bitcoin as a currency.  It is still a little early to tell right now but just recently we hit the 900 wall on Mt Gox. 899 to be exact. I will update my stance if things look like they are going south.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:31:58

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:12:57
If you are in the US Mt Gox is the worst as it takes months to get the money out. Bitstamp is bad because the wire fee is rather expensive. CampBX does allow ACH and I haven't heard of any problems with them. They have been around for some time and are located in Georgia. BTC-E you have to go through exchange services which will cost 2%+ depending on what you withdraw to.

If you have a ton of inputs (bitcoins received) the it will be over 10,000 bytes. But if it is only a few inputs it will likely be under 10,000 bytes. Only way to really tell is to just send it without a fee and look on Blockchain.info. That will give you the transaction size. If it is over the transaction will eventually be removed from the nodes. At that point you can send it again with a small fee.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:16:18
BTC-E but you have to use an exchange service which really brings down the amount you get. 
24change.com you can exchange it to Paypal for a 5% fee. Rather steep if you have lots of BTC.

For CampBX I don't think that you can buy at market value if you don't have funds for trading. Which is the one downside. If there is more liquidity on CampBX they will enabled short selling.
