Buffet is a more famous value investor. The reason he doesn't like bitcoin is the reason he doesn't like gold. It provides no value outside of itself. "I will say this about gold. If you took all the gold in the world, it would roughly make a cube 67 feet on a side…Now for that same cube of gold, it would be worth at today’s market prices about $7 trillion – that’s probably about a third of the value of all the stocks in the United States…For $7 trillion…you could have all the farmland in the United States, you could have about seven Exxon Mobils (XOM) and you could have a trillion dollars of walking-around money…And if you offered me the choice of looking at some 67 foot cube of gold and looking at it all day, and you know me touching it and fondling it occasionally…Call me crazy, but I’ll take the farmland and the Exxon Mobils.” He prefers companies because they not only have value from their holdings but also from their production.

I understand that Bitcoin is slightly more useful because it can be more easily exchanged into USD for purchases and provides some level of anonymity. Here is my concern and the reason I will never invest majorly in any cryptocurrency: The US government is already hiring CompSci's and putting them on the task of developing an algorithm that highlights transactions that are fraudulent, that fit the pattern of money laundering. Such algorithms are already well developed for looking at company transactions so I see it as only a matter of time before they fit it to bitcoin. At this point a large amount of the use of bitcoin will drop and go onto whatever incrementally more secure replacement currency arises. Because it is so easy to create a cryptocurrency and so easy to exchange between them people will dump their bitcoins and go to the new currency and a lot of people will get fucked.

Meh some people think that I just like to remind people there is risk. I hate to see posts that say people lost their life savings in XYZ investment. Whether it's pump n dump penny stocks, bitcoins, dogecoins w/e. It is very important people weigh risk/reward and only invest what they can afford to lose in more risky investments (aka everything not index/UST bonds).

Oh I agree at this point it's up in the air. I don't begrudge people who invest in bitcoin I just want to help inform them. Like I said I just hate to see posts about people losing their life savings.

Best of luck. If I had enough cash right now I'd probably have some small amount 1k or less in bitcoin, but I've just liquidated the last bit of stocks I had to pay off my final undergraduate semester. Hard to have any investment beat the value of no student loans.

Right that's why I say what you can afford to lose. It can be fun to try to beat the markets, but if it isn't your full time job you should expect that you could lose it all especially on small cap or other risky investments.

So is the risk.
