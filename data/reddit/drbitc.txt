If the seller holds a good reputation, you should have decent results. 
From a seller point of view on localbitcoin. I sold bitcoin using Moneygram for the first time yesterday. It went pretty smooth. I had some concerns, but it seemed to be ok.

My guess - it is because bitinstant is not working with btc-e currently. Easy transfer currency between Mt.Gox and btc-e made arbitrage opportunities like this possible. Arbirtrage has a tendency to equalize the exchanges.

PM Sent for $100 donation to Susan G. Komen for the Cure. The $100 donation was also matched 100% by another organization.
Edit: I just noticed that you want an original confirmation copy to ensure legitimacy. I have sent a follow-up PM.

A donation to a good cause from many individuals does lots of good - including promoting bitcoin itself.

Yes. There is definitely something fishy going on. I have seen numerous 4000 and 1500 BTC ask walls pop up then mysteriously disappear.
