You're an idiot. Life sometimes goes sideways and you need extra cash. Thank God for bitcoin. Grow up.

I think this is probably too expensive and complicated for me to get into.

Very cool. Thank you

Is this something that I'll need TOR for and be a hacker?  I'm well versed in both.  Edit: I see how it works. I'll give it a shot!

That's what I'm probably going to do but I thought I would get hit with less fees going directly to Bitcoin.

So they offer more money in exchange for gift cards because 1. it's a huge risk because they can some how cancel it or something? 2. They're probably stolen? Is there a better place to trade Bitcoin to USD? Should I use only bank transfers? Those shouldn't be any problem?

Well are there any good vendors that sell goods with bitcoin? Man I just want to sell some of my damn bitcoin and buy a guitar. This is god damn annoying. By the way, even now I'm getting PMs about buying gift cards from people. Theyre all giving me good deals. This place heaven for scammers.

Gosh no wonder people are scared of Bitcoin. It's completely full of scammers. Not even close to user friendly.

Ok great. Thank you for the info. I will use someone who has 3000+ trades and 100% feedback. I'll report back and let you know how it goes.
