Of course! I don't think that it will happen but here is how it would work: Start as a billionaire, buy bitcoin with all your net worth and then just wait for the crash to $10 - I think this would qualify as life-changing ;-) Not that I believe such a crash will happen but anything is possible if you wait long enough...

You still remember what a $ is? I am a bit disappointed ��

In Europe, you can find it on the internet. I bought tons of it immediately when I first saw it a couple of months ago ��

This - but even more importantly IMO: Why should we care whether stock-to-flow will ultimately play out in the very end. Anyone understanding what we are debating here will likely be fine anyway if it plays out even remotely, assuming BTC follows the stock-to-flow logic for just 2 or 3 more 4-yr cycles :)

"Classic" golden cross is on the 1D chart with 50/200 SMA after candle close - and at least my chart does not yet show it (BFX) although it seems inevitable by now in the very near future... Sorry, on mobile, so no chart

Last year I made this exact comment during Black Friday - but for some reason it felt slightly different back then LOL

Fair but true for all asset classes...

I keep my cold storage warm :-)

Pretty much my thinking. I have made a couple of parallel, sizable long-term financial bets in my life in very different areas, which could all "go to the moon" or " go bust". One of them is crypto, in particular Bitcoin. If only one of these bets does "go to the moon" in the next decades then I will be all set for life. Different approach from the majority of population but I enjoy it more than 5% p.a. :)

While this does look like authentic video material on yesterday's short squeeze, I personally find it tasteless to post it on the internet ;-)

Two start-ups in different areas of "digitalization of our lives" and one start-up in algorithmic trading

Oh, Op is talking about the cool-down of the last few days? I thought he meant all of 2018. That was a correction in my eyes - but nothing to fundamentally worry about at any point.

Looked at its longer-term chart - did not even pump during altcoin season end of 2017/early 2017. Just one big, continuous dump by its creators offloading. Keep your fingers off, guys, definitely scam!

Agree, I love it
