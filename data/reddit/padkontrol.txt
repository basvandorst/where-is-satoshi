It was built as an ad for those projects. Never intended to be news. It's quite brilliant bullshitting actually. 
1) Create a crypto project in secret
2) Create a news platform and operate at a financial loss and with fake management
3) Slowly weasel the news platform into sponsored content for your own crypto crap

Most people on this subreddit are either delusional, children, or literally both. That's why its a bad idea to ask for advice here.
Definitely _don't_ start a new project unless you have at least 6 months experience in the bitcoin space. Otherwise you'll screw up. Trust me, everyone so far has learned the hard way.
Join an existing free software project like Counterparty, colored coins, work on the Bitcoin code, or develop little open-source tools to get your feet wet.

Only if the project itself is implemented as a dApp, which depends entirely whether it can be expressed programatically, and whether people are willing to pay. Or reach consensus by voting, which is also hard to manage.
But Ethereum and Counterparty have exactly the same capabilities: a turing complete VM. The difference is that Counterparty can read Bitcoin data such as addresses and balances, as well as blocks, etc. Ethereum is supposed to have faster block times, but that hasn't been demonstrated yet.

This is actually surprisingly thought-provoking. Although I think wealth should be a separate index (if at all). "Fairness or decentralization" in the term of wealth is a non-sequitor, especially since anyone can have arbitrarily many addresses which are not connected to each other.

would be fascinating.

Better hide that safe because if someone sees it you bet you're going to be held at knifepoint to open it, even if there's nothing in it. On the other hand, nobody will give a crap about a piece of paper with a mnemonic (turned into a poem) on it. Maybe they should buy that $1000 safe with the last $1000 they have and lock you inside so your rationalizations can't harm anyone else.
Bitcoin avg 30 day volatility is ~1.5%. Better than many other currencies, to be honest.

Uhm. When Silkroad shut down BTC was at a minimum of $150. This means that he already had $600,000 at that point. Even if he quit using BTC months before, he would have had at least $400,000 in there. So either he was a big time pusher, or you are full of shit.

Cointelegraph started as a fake news platform with a fake CEO that was built by Altcoin creators to pump their own projects. The fact that they became a staple in crypto news is incidental.

Recent Bitcoin volatility has been ~1%, which is far more stable than the currencies of many countries. But I do not claim to know how this will affect Greece, in the Eurozone. Probably Bitcoiners will buy Bitcoin, and everyone else will probably put cash in their mattress...

@_date: 2014-11-13 07:52:04
It doesn't work like that. It would be insanely unmanagable to implement it into Bitcoin Core. XCP is a necessary intermediary currency, and they would have to create a new one (with no adoption, projects, etc.). Mastercoin tried this, they failed.
Recreating XCP would provide no economic incentives for devs, make the C++ code so unmanagable Bitcoin wouldn't make progress in years, introduce security risks, etc. For someone so aggressive at posting, you should work on getting informed. 
Counterparty has lots of promising projects on it, including Overstock. If anyone had the crazy idea to add it to Bitcoin Core, nothing would change. XCP would be XCP, since it uses the BTC blockchain already.
Adding such functionality to BTC without intermediaries is an impossibility, has no economic incentives, and wastes profound amounts of time and effort for no benefit. Honestly. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 07:32:06
I was here and I saw it posted everywhere, and the code was fully functional (as well as being the most elegant and readable altcoin ever). People just didn't care. Reddit was actively hostile. In all honesty, you can't blame the founders for not babysitting the community. 
I was one of the people who **really** tried to let people know about it. And you can clearly see that these sort of arguments only arise once the price starts climbing. 
And describing it as a pre-mine, is frankly inaccurate. Everybody bought their XCP like anyone else. The Bitcoin inner circle started with the people who understood the concept or code, and Counterparty did too.

While I agree with you on everything else, Sidechain functionality makes it harder to scale. Sidechains are hype that people were tricked into following blindly.  And you end up with more chains to manage.
They are a theoretical concept that is as old as alt-coins itself. It offers practically no innovation over what Namecoin, Litecoin, or altcoins can do... Anything that Sidechains can do, an altcoin can... 
It's absolutely free to attack the hashing power of the Sidechain too, and dilutes incentive and trust in the core network. Two-way pegs have serious security risks. This is corroborated by Peter Todd and many other experienced security professionals.

[Counterparty]( lets you create an asset, pay out vote tokens as dividends, which can then be sent to designated addresses that represent vote choices. You can also provide descriptions for everything, and call back votes.  This is all on the btc blockchain.

Counterparty is working very closely with the Bitcoin protocol (as it uses the Bitcoin blockchain). So technically they are helping Bitcoin to get out of beta.

Well, that's mostly true on paper. But English isn't _that_ simple. The brain still parses it differently, even if its supposed to be the same.

Open-source p2p protocols don't get wrecked so easily, and sidechains are far less secure. There's no reason to switch to a completely new architecture, which is less secure. XCP already has an ecosystem.
And really? Counterparty is just source code and users around the world, not a legal entity.
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:00:32
You can actually do this using the Counterparty XCP system. (On the Bitcoin blockchain directly) 
You can escrow XCP on a buy order in a way that cannot match. The order will be clearly visible, and returned to the user once its finished.

You see nothing wrong with that even though it's outlined as a massive problem _in the official sidechains whitepaper itself_? I'm at a loss for words. 
Chains have to be aware of each other, making them mandatory. They can also potentially crush the value, security, and integrity of the main chain.

I don't consider myself a troll. Of course it's reckless, but it could pay off insanely well. Especially if you consider that Bitcoin has many competitive advantages compared to fiat. The problem is it might take 5-10 years or longer. It's a waiting game.
In the worst case a different crypto could take priority, but that's something you would notice very early on and be able to escape with a mild loss. But that's contrary to the personal interest of investors as a whole, so it's unlikely to proceed that way.
In the end it's up to you. It's a gamble with extremely good odds. Definitely better than anything you'd get in any lottery or casino... It could be the next personal computing revolution and you'll be a billionaire, or not. But it's getting a lot of support from extremely intelligent people.

Counterparty is a system and protocol for encoding data into the Bitcoin blockchain. It uses Bitcoin transactions as a database, which then makes it possible to create and use financial tools. 
What makes this interesting is that it takes out the middlemen from trading, betting, and other financial applications. But Counterparty can be seen as a low-level protocol, and now Overstock wants to build a proper interface and stock market engine on top of it. 
If you have any more questions, let me know.

It's not about Bitcoin, it's about securities. You would have to argue in court (using a huge, overpaid legal team) that what you are doing is not that, or obtain a license.

A third friend of mine had cops burst into his house, and THEN they called a judge to get a warrant. He overheard the damn call. 
When I visited the U.S (as a scrawny 13 year old) they held me for over 6 hours at the airport due to 'suspicions'. They also confiscated my brother's fake bullet keychain that was his only possession he got from his late grandfather, and never gave it back. But they only held him for 30 minutes.

It won't make a difference if the tech is in Core, or outside of Core. It would either have to use XCP, or a brand new token, as an escrow and intermediary currency. (This is a technical requirement for a lot of the features.) I don't know what kind of scenario you are envisioning.

There are two types of asset names: named and numeric.
Named asset names require a certain XCP fee to be destroyed, in order to prevent one person from registering and squatting everything. 
Numeric asset names are FREE, do NOT require a fee for asset creation. So there will be no squatting, like with Bitcoin addresses.
Here you can see that EVEN WITH the fee for named assets, people still are trying to squat:

The fee to create an asset in Counterparty (XCP) is actually ~$1 (0.5 XCP). And not $10 as you stated. Trading and other Counterparty actions also only requires BTC transaction fees. While I support innovation in the Bitcoin space, please don't spread misinformation about other platforms.
The counterpartyd client also runs with Bitcoin core. And there is a non-centralized web wallet. I think it's worrying to store user information on a server, especially when dealing with assets which may carry substantial value.

Eventually all fees and protocol changes will be determined by a proof-of-stock XCP system wherein all users can vote. This was mentioned as a possibility by the devs. And keep in mind, the only fee is the asset creation fee! I don't know how you conjured up transaction fees or whatever, you must be confusing it with Mastercoin...
Also, they invested their own money into the project, and didn't obtain any funding. It's obviously in their best interest to make it as useful as possible.
Nobody is stopping anyone from joining the dev team, and they are actually very reasonable individuals. So far they've considered every proposed improvement and been receptive of the community. 
And the Bitcoin foundation generates profit and accepts investor funding, which would only make me more wary.
Btw: Does colored coins have a non-centralized wallet? Because I haven't seen one. A decentralized exchange? Escrow? Oracle betting? Trustless betting? Just wondering..

Banks put the trust in someone elses hands, which they can abuse in many situations, or inadvertently lose. Bitcoin makes you solely responsible for the security of your funds. 
It's a trade-off, the world isn't 100% black&amp;white.

Many banks use really ancient, unstable software and/or do not emphasize online security.

May be good to mention that STORJ uses [Counterparty XCP]( which didn't have an IPO.
@_date: 2014-10-10 06:02:40
Yeah and absolutely no serious investor would use a separate blockchain, because the network effect would be horrible, and the liquidity would be as trustworthy and developed as a dope dealer with holes in his pockets.
There's a reason Overstock is using the Bitcoin blockchain for example. It's not all about speed and fast transactions. You can have instant, free transactions. But what's the point, if the underlying system has almost no value?
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:49:51
For now, and XCP has a working proof-of-concept for fully trustless betting (rock paper scissors and rock paper scissors lizard spock). The feed system is being improved eventually, to allow relying on the majority of multiple feeds.
I think the pool system is a pretty good idea too though, and now that multi-sig is being integrated, it would be easier to implement. (I... think?)
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:21:10
He's 100% right
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:30:13
Since I don't consider myself a development expert, let me quote Peter Todd:
     
"There's a lot of stuff that's better done with the much simpler colored coin technology, but equally, there's a lot of stuff colored coins just can't do for technical reasons. In short, if you want to play around with Ethereum-style smart contracts in a decentralized system, you need a token of value like XCP."
@_date: 2014-09-04 15:24:00
What about privacy? 
@_date: 2014-09-04 15:36:14
I guess there really would not be much of a point. Maybe lowering costs on the infrastructure? Excluding companies from profit and the ability to have data caps? If its truly decentralized, then the fees would be lower, but if its centrally controlled then its utterly pointless.
@_date: 2014-11-21 20:17:26
I don't like blind obsession with anything. Unless its art. Decisions should be made rationally, and I think the escrow functionality of XCP is not to be underestimated. 
P.S. SPV alternatives are being researched. And there is currently a 125 XCP bounty for implementing a proposed SPV alternative. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 10:25:13
You could create a group for activism to help suppliers sell their produce for Bitcoin directly. This could take out a lot of the middlemen, and fees. It would have to be a non-profit, but there's an idea... 
But it's a better idea to sell your products for Bitcoin, and learn about the tech in your spare time.
@_date: 2014-12-19 23:36:24
You can create and use Counterparty assets with BTC alone, and you can pay dividends in BTC alone. You never even have to touch XCP.... Even the Counterparty founders say that the main incentive is to expand Bitcoin functionality as much as possible without requiring XCP (unless its a technical necessity). It's not slower or more costly to use. No idea where you get your info, seriously.
You should check out some materials, including [this post]( written by Peter Todd, and this list of [XCP myths](
Counterparty and Ethereum smart contracts are _identical_ and 100% cross compatible. No idea what you mean by "worse features". Anything that works on Ethereum will work on Counterparty, and vice versa. Anyone claiming anything different is just making stuff up. The VM is the same.
And just because there isn't a reddit community, doesn't mean there isn't a community. The Skype chats for example are active constantly, and there is a huge amount of development going on. (BitSIM, SWARM, BitcoinTangibleTrust, GEMS, Koinify, Medici, Foldingcoin, BetXCP, LTBCoin, Storj, etc...)
P.S. Counterparty accounts for more than 3% of ALL daily Bitcoin transactions.

3% of all Bitcoin transactions is not successful? The point of Counterparty was **never** to be a competitor to Bitcoin. It is supposed to extend the feature set of BTC as much as possible. You do not need XCP to create assets or trade them. You don't need any to do that. Seriously. XCP is only a technical necessity for smart contracts, because BTC is not turing-complete.

This is exactly why people should be using [Counterparty]( for betting. Your money is escrowed on the blockchain and 'operators' cannot run away with it. But I think everyone may have to experience theft for themselves until it gains traction.

Collect market data over a long time while quickly placing and removing orders. It's possible that it's less obvious now, but often times the volumes do not correspond whatsoever to any social activity going on for certain altcoins. I can't think of a way to prove this other than having access to their servers, which I don't. But the fact that Paycoin has huge volumes there and is still there after all the scamming, should be reason enough to avoid it. 
I'm not recommending any other exchange, so you can be certain that I'm not making this up for any personal gain. Better to use one that has decent standards though.

You must be joking. It uses a centralized web domain and the microcontroller isn't specifically designed to hold secrets, unlike smartcard technology. I'm really confused why you would think this. Are you trying to justify your purchase? There is absolutely no evidence that what you say is true. Please read the article again, and read about smartcards in the banking industry.

Please read the article in the OP, at the very least. The question is not about being user-friendly, it's about making your funds as hard to steal as possible.

edit: Maybe some more backstory... John McAfee tried to singlehandedly take down the mob and find new plant-based cures for diseases in Belize. He funded an elaborate lab for natural cures, and the pharma industry tried to have him arrested for producing 'meth' even though no precursors or anything like that were found.
He armed the community and police with a _shitload_ of guns and refused to give any bribes. He fixed his neighborhood and chased away the mob until he was falsely framed for the murder of his neighbor, was threatened that the same will happen to him, and had his assets seized and the entire house burned down. Politicians often visited his house to openly ask for bribes. He said "fuck off" and they did their best to try and murder him, but he hid inside a hole in the ground until he escaped while his house was in flames.
He was one tattooed 69 year old dude, with two 20 year old girlfriends, one of whom tried to shoot him in his sleep. She hit the pillow instead and thought it was her death sentence for sure. He woke up, took her gun and grounded her from her TV privileges for a month. He singlehandedly took on the mob in Belize, and is a [crazy ass mofo.](

Huh? They told the press they had a Honduras deal agreement, and it was published all over the world and on their own blog. Then they admitted in a chat that they only had a verbal agreement which was a 'maybe', and nothing was certain yet. They refused to publish a retraction and attacked those who suggested they should.
Has nothing to do with personal dislike or whatever. It's what Josh Garza did with Paycoin, saying he had deals with Amazon and Target. I don't know any of the Factom guys personally, nor do I have any reason to dislike their project other than this. I refuse to invest in anything except Bitcoin and have no reason or argument for or against Factom, other than that they misrepresented the state of their agreement to the media. Or at the very least, refused to publish a retraction of false statements (which pump the value of their project).

Bitcoin is not centralized, and many companies are trying to make it easier. The protocol itself has no way of becoming more 'accessible' in your sense of the word, and indeed that is a futile endeavor.

His account simply became inaccessible due to a software error that looks as if he overdrew it, which is IMPOSSIBLE because of his plan which doesn't even allow overdrafts..
**He was put in debt by the bank itself due to a software glitch**.
With Bitcoin he would be able to access his account, instead of sitting around in the bank until security escorts him out while all the employees say 'sorry we don't know what s wrong'.

Whoever has the most money owns everyone else. With enough cashflow you can dismantle and rebuild entire governments and make people disappear arbitrarily and affect their lives.
Just look at the guy whose bank account was overdrawn by $100,000 due to a bank software error, and it hasn't been resolved after a week. Just look at my grandfather, whose ownership of a street worth in excess of $20,000,000 was overwritten the day he died. What are you going to do, sue the government and pay the lawyers with the money they just stole from you?
Nobody is free unless they have money to escape. And if you have money, even a prison cannot turn you into a slave. They don't even have to touch you, print enough dollars, seize your properties and you're instantly in poverty. We live in a world where affluenza (the mere idea of _growing up_ with money, not even having it) is a reason to get out of jail free, for murder.
The only freedom we have left is mathematics within the ether of the internet, and even that is being threatened. The only way to escape slavery is to be anonymous, and store wealth everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. Which is really easy if you have a hundred million dollars, but was impossible for the average Joe until Bitcoin.
The illusion that the current system is working perfectly only works until you get punched in the mouth. Until your government is insolvent and you spend your days trekking to ATMs to withdraw $50 after 6 hours. Until your government decides to seize your property because its suddenly 'a protected historical area'. 
Until your bank randomly decides you are a criminal and locks all of your assets because of a software error, or a misstyped e-mail address. It's easy to stay asleep if nobody shakes your bed, and I know, it's pleasant. I wouldn't want to take it away from you, but I also know that I can't. Everyone will believe what they believe. 
I hope as many people can live their lives without realizing this, truly.

@_date: 2015-09-28 16:03:56
Yeah, for example. If you have an offline wallet, there is no way that manipulators can get your coins out. If it's in a bank it can:
* get screwed by fractional reserve
* devalue rapidly by printing more currency
* get frozen by government agencies
* get frozen by a large amount of different employees
* the bank can lose your data, and what then? people have a hard enough time formally proving that they're _not dead_ when a database marks them as such
* get frozen by the banking system automatically
* get deducted arbitrarily by a software glitch because some banks run win95 and such
* people can make deals, sales, and bribes that can directly affect the outcome of these previous occurences and worse
* Any schlub can read the exact details of your transactions and how much you have and spend. Private investigators love bank statements in the trash, because it lets you stalk a person so easily.
In the stock market, many have also correctly pointed out that a share can be owned by two people simultaneously... which means that only one can cash out. Etc. At least Bitcoin abides by mathematical laws and thermodynamics rather than pure sociology... You cannot assume everyone involved in the process of managing _your_ money is either rational or altruistic. 
When BTC addresses are associated with verified entities, then the blockchain remains a transparent and unalterable record of exactly what happened. This prevents a lot of manipulation as well. And some of what people call manipulation may not even be manipulation at all, but simply inefficiencies or loopholes. 
This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is perfect, but it is based on sound decentralized fundamentals and continuously evolving. I think this will become more clear with time. Although I do think it may take 10+ years, realistically. Of course it will still be possible to _massively_ manipulate Bitcoin... No denying that. But it's a huge improvement, and that _matters_.
And I realize these are kind of tangential examples, although I hope that you will realize what exactly I mean in the end. In the current system there are a lot more hushed deals that can be made in dark rooms around the world today, deals which would eventually screw you over.

Stuff like this happens with paypal all the time. I had my account frozen once and when I called customer support, three different people including a supervisor told me that "We don't know why your verified account can't send money without a credit card". They were trying to convince me it's a virus and to take my computer to a repair shop. I used 4 different devices in 2 different locations to test this... (Including a USB linux distro, and ethernet connection)
After several months it was working again. Nobody ever emailed me back, or called. Or anything. I simply stopped being able to send money without being prompted for a credit card, and Paypal representatives e-mailed and spoke to me on the phone saying "We don't know what is wrong. Your account is verified."
I only had about $50 in there, because I _barely_ use paypal. Almost never. But imagine this happens with a more sizeable amount.

@_date: 2015-03-13 12:45:33
The simplest way I can think to explain this is that Counterparty is an open-source, free (as in free software) toolkit for making advanced Bitcoin transactions. 
These transactions contain extra data, which can identify the individual transactions as 'actions'. These actions can do stuff like... 
* create a custom currency on top of Bitcoin (same addresses, security)
* trade your custom currency on the decentralized exchange (each buy/sell order is a Bitcoin transaction and _automatically_ matched to another. Meanwhile the funds are escrowed _inside the BTC blockchain_, meaning that nobody can Karpeles them away from you during the trading process.
* Create a data feed and post data into the Blockchain
* Place bet on this data feed (a.k.a broadcast), which are escrowed inside the Blockchain. This means that the bet creator never has access to the funds of the users that are betting. If the bet expires without being resolved, the funds are returned. This means reduced fees for all, and automatic escrow for betting.
* Ethereum smart contracts. This is the same thing as Ethereum essentially, but it is stored in the Bitcoin blockchain. Using the programming languages available for this purpose, you can create custom financial instruments and dAPPs (decentralized applications). Every execution step costs a certain amount of XCP, which is destroyed and taken out of circulation as a fee. Basically this is the 'feature to end all features', because users will be able to make whatever they require. Many if not all altcoins with their own blockchain can be made obsolete this way.
* Counterparty has the advantage of being easier to migrate to Bitcoin sidechains in the future, as well as being able to read data from the Bitcoin blockchain (such as block hash for randomness, etc).
For example a kickstarter app: 
As you will have probably noticed, I linked the ethereum page. This is because all ethereum / counterparty contracts run on the same virtual machine system. This means that they are 100% compatible and you can use them on _both_ platforms.
* 
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:50:34
You can't buy _anything_ with those amounts.
@_date: 2015-11-18 14:26:38


As opposed to buying Bitcoin with the $400 that it costs?
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:20:06
That won't help you protect individual nodes in the slightest.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:38:21
That's sort of a basic simplification yeah. Ethereum and Counterparty definitely do complement each other, and there is surely room for both to exist. Ethereum may (???) have faster blocktimes when its released, and be usable for a lot of things. Counterparty will remain more secure (Bitcoin network), and more suitable for high value transactions and contracts.
Since they run the same scripting language, it won't really matter which one is used. It'll be like learning piano and then playing on two different ones... In the end its the same thing. Counterparty benefits from being on Bitcoin, and Ethereum will benefit from faster blocktimes (supposedly). 
If Counterparty adds sidechain support (once sidechains are released in the first place....), then the situation may become different altogether. 
They're essentially two sides of the same coin. But what I don't like about Ethereum is that they raised so much money in a huge crowdfunder.... 
Counterparty has been live since 14 months (but the contracts system is currently being updated to the latest ethereum release). I just really like that the first thing Counterparty did was release code on Github... They didn't even ask for a cent. I like the agreement with Satoshi's philosophy in that respect, especially since IPO/pre-sales _may_ become a legal issue in many jurisdictions. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 22:59:55
This might be a stupid question, but what are the use cases for this thing?
@_date: 2015-11-19 20:23:36
You can DDoS the individual stores to shut them down, and law enforcement can show up at your house and steal your computer. Most home computers are not secure enough to run ecommerce, so there will be other vectors of attack too which can compromise your entire store. That sounds pretty censorable to me. A few dollars can rent you enough of a botnet to keep your competitors offline for days.

Unlocking your rental car can be the simple ownership of a token, you probably don't even need confirmations for it. It's not really such a big of an issue, and already possible today. The only time you need to wait for a few blocks is when buying it (probably not even that).
The problem here is one of perspective, Counterparty is designed from the ground up for high-value trading and financial instruments/markets. Of course with smart contracts, you will be able to do close to literally anything, but from what I can gather it's meant to be something like "Wall Street" for the 99% + 1%.

No, they forgot the entire point of DarkMarket and made something inefficient instead of going with the original idea. And I've _never_ gotten an answer to this question in weeks: how is OpenBazaar better than shopify or amazon?
@_date: 2015-10-20 15:29:03
Counterparty is interesting because it lets you store arbitrary amounts of data inside broadcasts. It also lets you store an arbitrary amount of data inside a tradeable token (for which you only need BTC). In most cases it's easier and more stable to use this than to build a new solution.
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:50:08
"The simulations show the token to be tied to the value of the protocol."
If you or anyone else in the world could perform such 'simulations', all of you would already be retired multi-billionaires. Sorry, but I still have the two braincells left that it takes not to don't buy this crap. Take your ponzi elsewhere please.

That.... that **is** by definition a permissioned ledger.
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:25:33
These permissioned ledgers are the first thing in my life that has truly convinced me that nobody knows what the fuck they are doing, and most of humanity is simply greedy and/or clueless. It's almost like a light went off. I finally _feel_ what it's like to be on a hurtling ball of dirt with a bunch of apes. There's no benefit over the existing banking system, nor is there a benefit over Bitcoin. They are simply "something new and flashy", but the people we think are capable of running the world... _they love it._ Help.
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:34:27
If the block speed is so high, why is the blockchain compact? What mining algorithm is this? I don't think anything is resistant to mining centralization...

Never criticize anything Bitcoin-related, got it.
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:45:04
I honestly don't understand why people can't use Counterparty instead or one of the other open-source solutions for this, which DIDN'T CROWDFUND OR ASK FOR MONEY, and can do _literally the same thing_. I found it suspicious when Factom started advertising in the Counterparty community, despite not using **a system that already works for their purposes**. They made no effort to build on it, but wanted to leech users.
That's sketchy behavior. It's like spamming linux forums with "Hey I'm going to make a new OS from scratch, give me money". Or going into bitcointalk and saying "hey give me money to make a fork of Bitcoin and change nothing, by the way it's permissioned."
Looks like team here researched the Bitcoin community a bit and said "Fuck 'em" and that became Factom... If the fact that they have like 30 'advisors' didn't ring any alarm bells, then please reconsider investing in anything else ever entirely.
When I first criticized it I easily got 30 downvotes here in the echo chamber, people never learn until their own money is openly being used to screw them over. And then suddenly it's a big scene. Sigh.
@_date: 2015-10-21 08:09:55
Yeah, right.
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:55:09
You should take a hint from protocols and projects that deployed without raising money with functional prototypes, and not letting people wait in limbo after $1.1 mil goes up in smoke.
@_date: 2015-10-30 13:34:04
They're not freely intercompatible unlike SWIFT and they cost more money (+operation costs). And customers don't have free access to them. If banks were to collude dishonestly it wouldn't make much of a difference. 
And I think you actually mean databases where the banks have to form a consensus, which doesn't require blockchains whatsoever. But those have existed since the 1980s... Let's call them shared ledgers. There is absolutely no benefit for a blockchain over a shared ledger, it's a step backwards.
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:27:06
At least it will push Bitcoin adoption...

It doesn't provide any benefits, it just wastes resources and money.
@_date: 2015-10-22 13:52:28
My objection is, what fever dream convinced you that this can be profitable whatsoever when people can simply use the Bitcoin blockchain and make a similar system for free using existing libraries.
@_date: 2015-10-30 10:36:58
It's basically implying Bitcoin is an 'experiment', while private permissioned and centralized blockchains are somehow going to change the world. This doesn't make sense, because the only advantage of a blockchain is immutability. If you have a closed system you are going to still be exposed to regulations, which renders the level of added efficiency non-existent.
@_date: 2015-10-26 21:18:56
Except the lack of functional market efficiency, convenience, and speed. It will only be useful for black markets.

@_date: 2015-03-13 13:29:28
That seems to be outdated/misinformation. A counterparty buy/sell order can very well be cancelled (easily!), and creating assets/trading _doesn't_ require any XCP, only a bitcoin transaction fee.
If you really _need_ a name for your asset, that is what costs 0.5 XCP to prevent squatting. But a regular asset (numeric) only requires a Bitcoin transaction and works just as well.

Apart from the fact that they both have the same scripting language... That means you can run anything on both. That kind of puts the point to rest, and it doesn't look like Bitcoin blockchain is going anywhere soon.

You get that conclusion from reading news sites that have nothing to do with Counterparty? They both accomplish the same purpose, but Counterparty uses the Bitcoin blockchain.

Bitcoin _could_ do that, but it would be insanely painful for everyone involved. It could take decades, and all the miners would have to be convinced. It could introduce a lot of security issues... It would be torture, I imagine. Counterparty resolves this by communicating with Bitcoin, instead of integrating into it.

Counterparty is doing smart contracts...  you can create custom financial instruments using a scripting language. Colored coins only lets you color satoshis, and thats it.
@_date: 2015-10-15 06:50:34
Counterparty too. They could've used the broadcast feature there, it supports arbitrary amounts of data. But I think they really wanted to crowdfund.

@_date: 2015-03-19 18:10:44
I should've been more specific. They have the same smart contracts virtual machine which makes it 100% compatible at a lower level than just having the same scripting language. This essentially means the same language(s) can be used. I mean, it's a port.
@_date: 2015-02-20 10:06:31
They should've mentioned that they're using [Counterparty]( There's some clever things you can build using Counterparty, especially now that the API and library was completely re-done to be more dev friendly.

Judd Bagley indicated that the move coincides with a shift in Medici's development that will help the company build on a wider variety of protocols and blockchains **in addition to Counterparty.**
And here's a [quote]( from the founder of Counterparty, "Obviously I wasn't talking about Evan and Robby leaving Overstock. **And Overstock is still using Counterparty for Medici.** (This has been reaffirmed publicly very recently.) I'm advising them personally on their technical design."
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:44:48
Correct. 
Source: I talk to people. In person. Not once has anyone asked me how to send or receive Bitcoins before addressing this. (Unless they were already familiar with both.)
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:21:14
That amount is converted to USD from HKD. They used Hong Kong dollars. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:47:38
If someone told me how to buy, send and receive something before explaining anything else, I would suspect they have a profit margin or simply not care. I don't think that's a much better 'social' strategy. 
People want to know why they should care, and why it's not a scam. This is classic. E.g. you don't tell girls your phone number and how to text, you convince them that they should give a shit and close with the fact that you're not a creep.
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:32:02
In Counterparty you can sign a message or create a broadcast from the issuance address that proves ownership. You can also change the description of a token to reflect that.
