What if Trezor ceased to exist?
The phrase you write down (seed), is that still useable somewhere else to access your bitcoin on the blockchain?
Like, say Trezor's servers get nuked and they vanish - gone (extreme, just for argument). Can I go import my coins into a new blockchain.info wallet just by knowing my word phrase backup?

What about blockchain.info or others?

Nope, simply saw the huge climb and was paranoid about missing out on something. I ended up holding, couldn't bring myself to cash in BTC, nor would I want to risk account freezes that I've been reading about on various key exchange platforms.
It's funny, do you people really think random accounts on Reddit could swing an entire market perception for noticeable gain? I'd be pretty worried if some reddit posters spreading FUD could noticeably impact an overall market with a cap of $45.7 billion.

I was afraid, like many, of missing the train.
Thankfully, I held BTC only.
Since my original comment, I don't think I'll diversify by trading my current BTC holdings. However, I definitely will be putting some profits and cash into eth and another one or two.

I'm not here to put anybody down, but if $100 for a hardware wallet is breaking the bank to secure your investment, you're wasting your time here. If you can't part with $100 for security and protection, then how much are you realistically investing into Bitcoin?
Sure, swing for the fences on a $.003 altcoin and hope that it takes off long term. However, if you're buying fractions of BTC, or even a handful of BTC, you're not going to make a ton of money. I don't understand the people presently buying their first 'btc' at like 0.823018btc. What are you really thinking BTC is going to hit?

What about the future of BTC in terms of other more highly functionable altcoins like Ether? Currently, I'm holding shy of 200 btc (had for years) and the more I read (I'm a complete noob), the more appealing Ethereum sounds application wise to functionality. Same with ripple?

Every day people worry BTC is at it's top :D
I feel like absolutely everyone is entirely clueless to what the ceiling of BTC will ever really be.

No, the story above is true :p
However, I did attempt to purchase something of a darknet long ago, but didn't get approved for the sale :o

I have access to the flash drive, it actually wasn't encrypted. I found the login info to my old 'hot wallet' and logged in and saw my balance. My concern is when going to finally sell, what happens when I can't prove where I got the amount of coins from.

I've been trying to read a lot about altcoin options.
As mentioned in a post I made, I'm in this for LONG. I'm not worried about a heavy correction and paranoid sell-off as long as the long-term sentiment is a recovery and stabilization. 
Some alt's did piqued my interest, such as Golem, XRP, NXT, NEM.
Ethereum actually quite strongly piqued my interest in terms of actually trading ALL of my BTC for Ether because of the heavy interest shown by a few fortune 500 companies and the tech community as a whole. I felt like I'm much more likely to see a 400% gain in $250/eth going to $1,000/eth long before ever seeing $2,500/btc going to $10,000/btc.
