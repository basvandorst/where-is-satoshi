Bitcoin is constantly being marketed as censorship resistant, and users encouraged to run their own nodes, but a Lightning node can do same censorship and we pay fees to the Lightning node instead of miners. Seems counter logical. Am i getting this wrong?

It took me over an hour to get one of the stuck tx's to get through + fee, but I had to do it to keep my reputation and not look like somebody who scammed a n00b. I don't wanna do this crap anymore. I think I paid equivalent tx fee of what the n00b was trying to transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:03
"Will make alts useless"- Bitcoin BTC has been useless for more than half a year. This year, everytime I sent n00bs Bitcoin, I had to personally go to their location and 'un stuck' their Bitcoin they sent that was stuck in mempool. This makes BTC more than useless, it damages my reputation because I promise them something functional and futuristic, but they just think they lost their money and payment never arrived, "and had to call buddy to fix it".... but hey the price is going up!..

Gotta give it to you fools.. hodling an asset that's gone 20x in 1 year and doesn't even work .. fees and tx backlog insane. I''m out since we even hit $10k because fundamentals  hah.

You don't want Bitcoins or USD, you want the things they can buy. So if Bitcoin buys you more and more over time and you can transfer that value anywhere in world instantly without anyone being able to intercept it - that's a unique function. Both Bitcoin and USD is based purely on faith that both will have buying power tomorrow. Bitcoin is decentralized, USD is centralized.

I had never used LocalBitcoins, neither had my friend. Friend needed money in Norway for rent, I am in California. Hits me up at midnight, I send him Bitcoins to his newly created LocalBitcoins acccount. In less than 2 hours he was able to figure out how to use it, find a buyer and has his bank account funded with NOK (Norwegian Kroner). 
That, my friend, could not have been with regular banking system at midnight California time, on a Friday.

It is best not to talk about Altcoins here because you will get banned. Just use Bitcoin Core like this Subreddit wants you to and pay your fees. In couple years maybe (if everything goes right) Blockstream will have the Lightning Network up and we can subscribe to it and keep the transactions off-chain and just pay Blockstream instead of the miners, should be cheaper and network will also be connected to the banks since both parties in Lightning Network channel must be online at all times, so you can probably go to a bank and wire money through the Lightning Network in the future.

Currently according to Bitcoinfees.info the avg tx fee right now is $14.38 to be included in next block and that is not that much compared to JP Morgan Bank Wire expedited at $60, and usually (during last days) much faster (2-3 hours for 6 confirms vs bank 3-4 days wire transfer) . Appreciate how much better this is compared to blood thirsty banks.

This is on Cryptowat.ch, with KRW USD exchange rate turned on, so it shows USD not KRW. 
They are having major banks do BTC wallet testing today, so they are a lot more excited than Coinbase or BitfinScam.

He probably means that Bitcoin Cash has block size limit of 8mb, but even 8mb size blocks will be full eventually. The 8x size increase in blocks in BCH would buy time, because currently BTC in its current state is quite unusable by a lot of novice individuals, who have no idea how to increase Tx fees or fix stuck transactions. 
Payment providers such as BitGo depend on micro payments going through with low fees, such as buying beer at a BTC-terminal enabled business, but if beer costs less than BTC Tx fee, why use BTC and not fiat cash? .. so a lot of business need scaling NOW, any solution is better than waiting, hence they are forced to switch to a crypto with enough throughput, no matter how imperfect it is, it will work for now to keep business' afloat. BCH is quickest solution for payment providers to switch to because they don't need to upgrade the code to run it, SW and LN both need code updated and that costs time and money and need to find the human capital to construct the new code to accept BTC w/ SW and LN. BCH is the fastest (imperfect) solution.

It could be attractive for a bank to lend money if the money never leaves the bank, frozen in acct that bank controls, bank gets interest and tether.to creates tether tokens based on assets at bank.

Sweet we are almost below $10,000,000 in tx fees stuck in mempool!

People like you are little too touchy about Bitcoin. Your post immediately assumes that I shit on the whole Bitcoin concept, and you think the OP post is another one of those 'Bitcoin will never work'. Your prejudice bias to 'protect' Bitcoin clouds your vision. You immediately jump to an extreme suggesting I am suggesting an 'communist coin'. 
To put this in perspective- When your girlfriend does not call you one evening, do you break up with her next day while calling her a cheater?
There was nothing in my post doubting the idea of Bitcoin, but rather an attempt to understand the future path of Bitcoin and what the future has to bring. My motion here was to understand other people's vision of future of Bitcoin, in order to bring foreign points of view to my attention. I did this to 'un-cloud' my vision of my own bias.
