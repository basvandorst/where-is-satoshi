Tried this with a few of the files on another machine. No go, they're encrypted.

45 miles away is the nearest one.

If you would sell to me what service would you use?

Windows 10. No idea how it happened, the only thing that VM is used for is my budged program (YNAB), Plex (all downloads done via VPN and invite only torrent site), and backing up files. I've never checked my email with it, I've never installed any unknown software.

I don't understand your comment, other than trolling. I'm attempting to resolve an issue using as many resources as I have available.

Because what other option do I have, other than losing all of my files? I have a brute force working on decrypting the files but that has a very low success rate.

Thank you. I've yet to find a site where I can get the bitcoin anytime soon, so I don't know what I'll do. I would pay at least $150, but every place I've found wants almost $2 per dollar to get it, so $150 in bitcoin is gonna run me close to $500. I don't have $500 to spend on that.

The pictures of my wedding, my kids birth, all the birthday parties, all the vehicles I've owned, all the projects I've done. Gone. It makes me sick.

Correct, they have this function. I have already backed up the most important documents, but I have 14,xxx pictures uploaded that I would have to download previous version and then upload again. I'm willing to do that, just seeing if there's any other way to get them back faster.

I have to pay within 24 hours and have never even considered buying anything bitcoin before. What's the best website to use? I want to use paypal to purchase.

Nope.

I had my important files backed up to Google Drive, which was encrypted because it synced locally.

I'm running a brute force decryptor right now, but windows 10 decided that it needed to reboot and I had to start over.
