just heard about new proposal to support american right to BDS by 1 of the squad (ilhan omar)
how about AOC + the squad **(RE)** introduce/ sponsor a bill to **AUDIT THE FED?** &amp; lets see if they can really swallow the whole red pill o_O
ps does anyone want to audit BITCOIN!? **lol!** just download the blockchain! and let the politicians explain why bitcoin is subversive + a terroristic threat to a sound economy &amp; democracy :P

no kidding! check out this 2002 paper "fractional reserve banking as economic parasitism" &amp; proposed a *secure/ integrity-based* digital currency system. also note the Fed is not even required to report the full money supply expansion after key rule changes over the years...

this sounds great but is hard to figure out from (rather vague) press announcements. its an "exchange". for bitcoin. what else? is it for currency trading? does it handle any other cryptocurrencies? 
also (as asked in another comment) a simple list of what US states allow the exchange would be helpful.

ok, this is amazing/ great/ potential gamechanger but bitcoin has fees too and varying value, and the owner seems to be going on gut instinct &amp; not nec quantifying the difference. 
no question though, transaction overhead is going to be put under a microscope in the years ahead. and there have been class action lawsuits against credit card companies for collusion on/ noncompetitive pricing etc, there was a big one a few yrs ago by walmart iirc, and also another merchant organization. 
it would be quite fascinating to see a history of this &amp; an analysis of new trends wrt bitcoin + cryptocurrencies. it does look like some will be optimized to minimize transaction fees. also, microcurrency capability. btw, am not sure bitcoin will be the most competitive wrt that.

think **Klarreich** writer seems to miss big picture sometimes &amp; wonder if the latest researchers/ findings are really just quibbling over different curve fitting. if researchers agree theres a new science there (specifically on **nongaussian/ heavy tails/ fractal distributions**), then the original researchers/ **pioneers** such as **Barabasi** et al are largely vindicated, and their imprecision is just the typical imprecision of a **new field being born.**

there is a concept in politics called *"redistribution"*. it sounds simple but is very complex. it used to mean "taxing the rich to redistribute gains to the poor". but the real dynamics of our economic system, nearly capitalism itself as now practiced, has effectively been redistributing from the poor and now even _middle class_ to the rich! this increased since the 1970s and is disguised very well for most of this time. the FED is involved in this redistribution, and the clear evidence of it is in INFLATION. the gains of INFLATION are not distributed equally, it is hidden embezzlement (aka "theft") of the 99% by the 1%...
