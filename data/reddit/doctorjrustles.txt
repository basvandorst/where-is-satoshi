I have exactly one pair of cargo shorts that I wear maybe once a year. But they're not neckbeard-matching so I can't wear my eighty fedoras.

Uniqlo should have people in house to do alterations. I'm very jealous you have one, I lived in NYC and loved it and moved away and miss my Uniqlo. They have solid quality clothes at cheap prices and they aren't horrible to look at either!

So the egifter thing...   It really works? I'm anxious to try it out but I've hesitated because I'm just...   I'm skeptical of anything that easy. 
But it works? Awesome.

I'm definitely gonna give this a shot.  I might just buy a videogame with Bitcoin.

One of my favorite studies in high school was the tulip fiasco.  This is brilliant.

If you have a brick and mortar Nordstrom Rack near you Holy Shit go there. Great prices and they have everything for tall folks. Not to mention they have shoes for us too; I wear a size sixteen and have since I was in my early teens, so I rarely get to buy shoes in a store.  The Rack has everything!!!

We call them 'sloots' here.  Always open for business, yet always sold out.
