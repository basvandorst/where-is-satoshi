Here's my proposal to those psychos &amp; their supporters
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:37:41
Wax, you are either naive or jerking me around: "Wrong decision on the judge's part" - ROFL !!!  
His job is to fill cold cages with warm bodies, his existence depends on it: he is NEVER wrong !!!  
  
Ben since you are reading I got the most solid idea for you this fine day -- get to it ! ...

@_date: 2014-07-19 14:49:43
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:16:00
government should be disappearing, and fast; cancer on the face of this planet
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:45:25
I got a couple words for the people who are forcing me to live my life a certain way.
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:18:03
Yo Ben!  
Guess what...
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:34:24
What a nice thing to say to Ben ! loving it
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:53:59
Or it could just be a bullshit ploy to entice the Scottish people to not escape from the British Empire. :)
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:32:47


A piece of toilet paper scribbled on by a geezer in a dress.  
@_date: 2014-07-20 23:02:29
That's actually a pretty good outcome for them fucks , considering...
@_date: 2014-07-20 04:13:07
You know what I'd like to say to Ben
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:12:50
Anyone surprised that the scum pigs here feel most pleasure picking on little old ladies?
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:19:54
you owe?
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:24:17
If you are wrong then FreedomHosting was another miracle
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:49:47
Me to NY slave-drivers:   
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:23:08
Dear Ben Lawsky,  
  
I think I speak for everyone here  
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:19:32
Shit does float to the top sure.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:26:14
Hey Ben, allow me to summarize our thoughts here...
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:34:25
Sure it could.  
And would ... if the people in power do not love power too much.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:02:44
I got the most sensible answer to the "State of New York" or any other state !
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:23:35
Oh yeah, the great provider of useful tools.  
I hear Zyklon B was created &amp; advertised to be used for PEST EXERMINATION too..
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:02:11
Hear hear brother.  
Ben, how many times do I have to tell you ?!!!
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:18:48
illegal , says who?  
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:27:19
You are thinking of FreedomHosting on which TorMail used to be.  
Riddle me this -- how did they find the FreedomHosting servers to infect with malware in the first place?
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:08:56
A got a few words for them though bro
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:56:04
And I know just the thing to tell them
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:58:46
May? seriously?
@_date: 2014-07-18 06:07:59
Having created this account in honor of Ben Lawsky I realize how sad it is that the only reason we even notice him &amp; his bunch of sadistic cunts is because he's way better armed than us decent folk.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:18:07
You mean well but you are naive: it's Ross against The State.  
They are all just faceless cogs in the apparatus.  
You think it matters that one of them wears a funny black dress instead of a brown shirt or a blue costume?
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:21:05
Pride perhaps ?
@_date: 2014-10-10 12:22:07
People get designated as spam, illegal, against the law as well.  
And just like here tools get built to exterminate them of course
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:21:44
Ah, the classic Nuremberg trials excuse: "just doing my job".
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:08:50
And if you appear to be resisting they'll poke you full of holes or choke you or throw a grenade in your face right then and there... or worse.
@_date: 2014-07-20 03:58:17
"It's always darkest just before the dawn" so you may be right.  
In any case I'd like to extend my cheerful Ben-message to all public parasites !!!!!
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:14:48
I remember this bastard being so happy when the original Silk Road Tor Hidden Service got busted.
And I remember the blacklists he was pushing through the Bitcoin Foundation.
You devious piece of shit being paid by Circle, you never stop
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:18:32
It's never a wrong time to go tell Governments &amp; their various bootlickers to GO FUCK THEMSELVES.  
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:08:23
hope this is clear 
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:49:24
PIGS II PORK
@_date: 2014-08-13 06:26:15
This is hillarious.  
A libertarian (a big L but still) donating via bitcoin is worried about some fucking law???
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:25:54
[My username is in honor of all government parasites.]  
GOOD people break bad laws. Thank you Charlie
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:54:18
I know, they are dumb &amp; evil.  
Well, here Ben: GO FUCK YOURSELF!
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:52:16
I should really register GoFuckYourselfBen.com
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:37:03
Hi Ben, I am here to suggest the proper response to your pathetic threats.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:12:22
Nice!  
Repentance is appreciated. A sign of humanity.
@_date: 2014-08-12 01:01:13
Let's see you at 78 you bootlicker.  
Actually let's not
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:45:28
I came here to chew bubblegum and tell you Ben the very best thing you can do now !
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:26:32
And here's my compliance
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:40:10
Amen to that.  
To Ben I am just repeating it over &amp; over
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:36:42


This sadistic pig Ben is following the playbook of Mao: 
Pretending to allow dissent in order to collect intel and to ease subsequent persecutions. And many of you fell for it. :(
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:52:39
Just in case
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:05:21
summarizing: hey banksters &amp; and kommandants
@_date: 2014-07-20 02:11:37
yup, always be aware of mortal danger mates  
And to every government parasite my message is loud and clear !
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:44:44
I am here to explore "saying NO" to the government
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:40:50
Yes please beg your overlord for mercy
@_date: 2014-07-23 04:06:43
It's great to be king. Yo Ben - know what?
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:09:20
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:01:32
When dealing with merciless psychos armed with tanks &amp; nukes one better obey.  
Now... begging is a choice.
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:27:16
Hurry Ben hurry !!!  
Take my advice...  
Take it long and hard !
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:13:39
How dare you use that kind of language around here :D
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:46:49
Neither a minority (one prick) or a majority (one prick picked by a few more) telling me what to do will make me happier.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:39:09
He really needs to hear it that's why ... for the rest of his short disgusting pityful life...
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:10:00
David, I couldn't have said it better myself! :)
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:05:21
I call 'regulators' cowardly pigs.
@_date: 2014-08-06 03:28:43
I hear a libraries are also nice. Ask Ross
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:54:57


  
suffices :)
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:31:13
I got a difference piece of advice
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:36:05
amen to that brother !  
I was created to do just the same - my message loud &amp; clear !
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:36:02
Can't ignore him. The punk's walking all over us.  
Gotta convince him to do something else, like ... :)
@_date: 2014-07-20 04:18:17
Very good point. Perhaps I should amend my message to this lowlife scum AKA Ben Lawsky.
@_date: 2014-10-10 13:20:56
The changes have been accepted into Gentoo branch!  
Luke himself turned them off for today you see...   
Such great code it is
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:55:44
You know what makes sense for those in support of this shit to do?
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:29:52
I got a proposal
@_date: 2014-08-06 07:27:15
Any information one can get on his enemy is valuable.
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:25:00
Am I repeating myself ?
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:57:02
I am here to help the debate bro !!
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:29:14
2nd that
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:28:09
I am reaching out to them vultures every chance I get. Hey Ben you fuck, this is for you...
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:03:55
Amen to that brother.  
Government -- FUCK YOURSELF !
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:41:24
If I weren't so shy, I'd tell you how I really feel about this delusional garbage
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:18:30
That doesn't work bro. People rarely fork or run custom versions.  
Once he poisons the source we are fucked.
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:19:18
you owe?
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:37:31
Love what you are suggesting, let me reiterate our message to those control freaks.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:37:13
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:42:28
Always engaging the slime at full speed !
@_date: 2014-08-25 13:40:58
To answer your question I just did a ton of research (watched Mad Max 2: Road Warrior).  
You are correct -- you will not be using Bitcoin in Sydney.  :)
So stock pile leather studs -- you'll be all set. Or gasoline...
@_date: 2014-08-12 01:04:24
Fucking pigs, turned every country into shit.
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:42:09
Here's what you gotta do Ben
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:06:46
Well I got the perfect answer to that bullshit phrase "for your own good" - Ben, can you guess what it is... ;)
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:59:47
It's a trick of course.  
Like those "Free Speech Zones".  
  
The bastard is telling us to leave Bitcoin in his domain and go do your freedom-work elsewhere...  
@_date: 2014-08-12 00:53:31
Guess what? Fuck the law
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:58:54
Glad to have helped.
@_date: 2014-08-25 21:57:50
Coolio !  
Didn't know it's possible to appreciate this man more.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:09:26
Cool article.  
And I got 3 words for you brown-noser
@_date: 2014-07-22 13:03:04
we use other words actually
@_date: 2014-10-10 12:36:19
He builds such wonderful tools...  
Ways to block unwanted transactions on every node in the world. So what that he temporarily removed the blacklist for today...  
It's really only for BAD people, no worries
@_date: 2014-08-20 22:12:21
Loving it !!! Godspeed fellas
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:57:14
changetip no  
but the CIA of course does use Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-09-10 16:42:33
And this clown got the Nobel Economics Prize?  
What's next? The nimrods will give Obama the Nobel Peace Prize?! ... oh wait
@_date: 2014-08-06 02:02:48
I love this guy!  
And Ben... go fuck yourself
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:01:33
I've got one thing to say to this Ben punk.  
But I outta stop being this nice.
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:26:01
here's my reaction
@_date: 2014-10-10 12:11:54
It's good to be king
@_date: 2014-07-24 05:58:13
I hope you are kidding, otherwise...
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:33:58
They got any BTC ATMs in Syria?
@_date: 2014-08-12 01:58:10
You appear to be somewhat inconsistent.  
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:33:13
Terrist financing!!  
Blockchain tracing anyone
@_date: 2014-07-20 22:52:52
The parasitic class (your leaders, masking as servants - for whom I created this very account) is very much happy there.
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:22:49
We do more than disagee, we provide very logical rebuttals. Excuse the pun
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:55:56
allow me to comment
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:07:45
Beware of US, consumers
@_date: 2014-07-21 04:28:43
He is from the government and he is here you help you...  you didn't know did you?  
[My response to Ben &amp; his pricks, on the other hand, has always been the same.]
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:16:38
You are not??  
Well you forgot to join the FAT BLUE LINE - then you'll be able to ... with impunity
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:38:22


  
Your ass is owned by the US gov't. But sadly so is everyone else's on this planet. :(
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:17:06
Providing clarity:  
"First we break your left kneecap, THEN your right. In that order. Everybody clear?
@_date: 2014-07-20 01:12:28
He isn't? Pinky-promise ???
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:31:33
How are ransoms being paid now? In dollars?
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:05:05
Funny, every time Narco-Terrorists are mentioned I hear : CIA.  
And of course we know what we want to say to Ben...
