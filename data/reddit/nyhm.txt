Thank you for your pledge to fund a player with BTC!

By the way, I'm keeping my eye on the USD exchange rate. It's now over $7, so I've adjusted the offer:  When demand increases, I'll improve automation. For now, I have fun keeping my eye on things. More feedback greatly appreciated!

Here's my bitcointalk.org post that Island Forge is accepting Bitcoin:

FYI: Did some rearranging and cleaned up the main page. Now game links listed alongside Featured Games on the main page.

Thanks so much to those providing donations, it's very inspiring, and shows the potential of the Bitcoin community. Crowd-sourcing is as accessible as putting up an address and getting the word out (and having something people care about).

That **is** a good article - and I love your term *intriguing*! I've included lots of classic RPG elements, yet everything is designed to be unique. I hope the indie game community appreciates that I'm trying to break the mold, rather than follow all the traditional RPG fare. Thanks for your input.

Whoa - I accidentally stumbled upon your gambling post, then came here and saw your link. Notice that Bitcoin Game List is not specifically for gambling, but that seems to be predominant in the Bitcoin market so far.
Also, I'm not personally populating the list. The list depends on the game owners to submit their listings. Should I provide a community (non-game-owner) submit form as well? 
Please discuss at

Eagerly anticipating my first Bitcoin customer (I'm the sole developer of Island Forge), or by all means encourage my Bitcoin efforts with a donation: 1PGf3ybkHkWCoN71JDic44faFHQAEpbXHg

Now accepting Bitcoin at 10% off the standard subscription rate!

Great feedback, Fjordo! I actually do quite agree with you. While I could conceivably spend bitcoins directly for some services, things such as food and rent need to be converted. To begin, I just wanted to start with a simple, manual process, so I could get my hands dirty and really interact with players who are into Bitcoin. I've looked at bitpay (and others), and agree that those are fine options for streamlining the payment process in the future.
I'm proud to accept Bitcoin, and I hope the community will help me to get started, so I can do even more to support Bitcoin!

Island Forge is subscription-based because it's a persistent world, ongoing service, MMORPG. You create your own islands with stories, and the gameplay is an ongoing experience. Not to get all business on this, but I don't have the deep pockets of the big corporate freemium games, and I have to be able to pay the bills. It's just me here, and this has been a big undertaking. I'm proud and humbled to be at this point, and every subscriber is greatly appreciated.

Electrum looks nice and has very active development. If you want even more tiny, simple, and obscure, try VanillaWallet.com (very minimalistic). Full disclosure: I'm the dev.

Bitcoin is still very new, experimental, and volatile. Although I'm extremely enthusiastic about Bitcoin, there's a good chance it won't maintain its current exchange rate. When dealing with economies of scale, the benefits you mention can certainly make Bitcoin services cheaper; however, I'm just starting out and if I'm going to go out on a limb to take bitcoins, I have to cover my potential risks. Also, exchange rates are just an artifact of legacy currency, right? 1BTC/mo sounds like a nice round number. All said, I do understand your point, so thank you very much for your comment.

Hey, I've been to CoinDL. Nice looking service (although I can't say I've bought or sold anything yet). We've probably chatted over at bitcointalk.org, too.
Anyway, I've just officially released Island Forge this week (Jul 2), but I've had a steady stream of (free) beta player signups for several months prior. Regarding content, players create islands, so they're pretty easy to count, although I can say that there are many more yet unpublished islands than islands available in the world.
I'm glad you like the video - it was my first one, and I managed to do it with minimal editing by taking one continuous shot!
The world has a backstory, which is hinted at on the gameplay page (and elsewhere), but players are free to weave their own tales!
Thanks for your offer of web dev help. Someday I'll need help, but for the time being, I like to get my hands dirty. If players actually want to pay with bitcoins, I think I can integrate it alongside the existing (PayPal) membership logic. That said, I'll certainly keep you in mind when I get stuck and need expert advice!

Yes, Island Forge is written entirely in Java (by me). I'd love to port it to android, but I have no such device. I've been developing Island Forge for ... a while now, and my first priorities are hosting, rent, then food, and then an android tablet!
@_date: 2012-07-06 13:13:47
Thanks for your review! I agree that the world is much more interesting with lots of people. Island Forge is all about player participation (creating your own islands with stories, and exploring each other's creations).
Help me spread the word! It's just me here, and I'm new at marketing, so any boost I can get from the community is most appreciated.
@_date: 2012-07-06 14:14:22
Yes, that is very true. I guess I was just trying to deliver my sob story about not having a shiny tablet (or smart phone). The full story is that I'd love to get into android development (for this game or the many other ideas I have, including Bitcoin-related apps), but Island Forge must get off the ground first. Thanks for your reply!
