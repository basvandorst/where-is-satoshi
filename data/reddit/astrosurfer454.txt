A couple of weeks ago there was an informal discussion with Phil Potter, CFO of Bitfinex, about this topic on the Whaleclub teamspeak. There was also a Youtube copy of the discussion that since has been deleted. 
Here is a discussion from that talked about the hack and the discussion with Phil (also has been removed at some point):
The TL;DR is something like this:
- Bitfinex requested that a new feature being added to the API they used with BitGo who co-sign every transaction. One part of that feature allowed the Bitfinex key to unilaterally change the criterias which BitGo uses to check before they sign with their key 
- Because everything from Bitfinex and BitGo is open source, someone realized that if they have the Bitfinex key they can change the criteria and essentially circumvent BitGo
- Bitfinex and neither BitGo realized that this new feature opened up this attack vector. The idea for the feature was to change permissions for withdrawal limits of an account by account basis dependent on how trusted the user is. But the feature could also be used to change those limits on a GLOBAL basis which let to their downfall namely 120,000 BTC lost (and 90,000 remained)
- A lot of smart people from BitGo and Bitfinex were working on this but no one saw it coming
- BitGo was never compromised. They simply did what they were asked to do under the established API rules 
- Since then BitGo changed their policy and criterias for withdrawals cannot be changed using the API anymore 
- It is still unclear how exactly the hacker got into possession of the Bitfinex key. But there are some strong hints how and those possibilities have been shut down (obviously Phil was not allowed to give details for legal reasons)
- After the hack Bitfinex switched back to a classical hot/cold wallet system which is being used widely by other exchanges and trusted for several years
