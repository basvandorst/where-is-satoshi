I read this earlier. Hopefully his knowledge of Bitcoin will influence the design of the new system they are making.

Offering a solution and people accepting that solution are two different issues. Is Bitcoin a solution? Yes. Will the Greeks take it? Many won't.

I agree gold and silver are good to have.  But in the event you need to get funds out of the country, you won't be able to take your gold with you (likely).

How does Bitreserve handle conversions with regard to taxable events?  Since it is bitcoin in and bitcoin out, does that mean I am "holding coins" in a technical sense the entire time?

How do you make money and what rate do you charge for the Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:30:03
I believe this is referring to smart contracts, which would, yes, replace many lawyers.
@_date: 2015-06-18 17:08:53
Even in a "deal" situation, the Greeks could be facing a bail-in where their funds will be seized.  Not all of their funds, but some.  Not to mention the capitol controls where people won't have access to their money for weeks.  This happened in Cyprus also, where there was no "default" but there was a bail-in.
Of course, it is also likely (and as this article indicates, MORE likely) that there won't be a deal, in which case all the worst-case scenarios play out.
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:03:25
I could have sworn they accepted it.
Other alternatives are Bitreserve and Vaultoro.  Vaultoro is the only physical gold option of the two.  Bitreserve doesn't really give you physical, and they charge big fees for converting.
If you want to spend fiat, you can go with BullionVault.  They don't accept Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:44:51
Bitgold is a Canadian company. You buy physical gold with Bitcoin.

It's funny when the banks that have just been convicted of money laundering are skeptical of Bitcoin bc it could be used for crime.

It's a shame because Bitcoin has brought us to a time where this shouldn't happen to anyone anymore.  If only more people knew the options available to them.

This is the first financial crisis test for Bitcoin post-Cyprus.  The entire world is watching.  Bitcoin represents a lifeline to Greeks who are facing seizure of their funds if they keep their money in the banks.  The CEO of Coinbase is tweeting to Greeks about how they can use Bitcoin to escape the coming collapse.  I think it's relevant to this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:58:20
I think another collapse is coming and it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin performs during the crisis.
I'm also unclear how governments might be able to shut off access to Bitcoin through internet controls, and what role future mesh networks might play in thwarting those controls.

It's impossible to answer BC dollars will change in value too. Bitcoin worth $1000000000 shitty inflated dollars may buy a loaf of bread.

I've never had confidence in Gavin.  I see him as a total liability.  He was just in the right place at the right time and fell ass-backwards into his current role.  Let the market decide where to take Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-28 15:15:00
I assume this only for fiat withdrawls?  If you withdraw using BTC I wonder if they care.

They are generated from your wallet "private key" and are unique to you.  No one else will ever have those addresses but you.
@_date: 2014-04-17 06:19:26
The primary function of currency is to store value. Forcing me to spend money today by making it worth less tomorrow undermines the fundamental purpose of money. Might as well treat it as mana that will spoil in the morning. Government pushes this bogus argument that inflation encourages spending to excuse their mismanagement of our monetary system. Its not their job to encourage my spending one way or another.

Sadly, I'm shown a 404 page that says "and it's gone" -- which is not funny in the context of a Bitcoin exchange website.

I tried clearing cache and cookies on my end, but no bueno.  I could try the smartphone route, but until Bitstamp works on my computer like normal they are considered "down" in my book.

"Fleeing the scene" clenched his guilt for Leah.  Let me get this straight --
She lied to him in online emails about who she was, stalked him to his home, confronted him on his own property, he asked her to leave, cops were called, she wrote a bunch of madeup bullshit in her article effectively ruining his life, she car chased him throughout LA, and then we find out he doesn't even know what Bitcoin is.
Ya, that sounds like somebody with something to hide.  The public has a right to know!

Ya, I don't get it.  A lot of information getting combined into "conspiracy" and "corruption".
If he operated an exchange that people used to get BTC, he can't be held responsible for what they do with the BTC they bought.  If he also bought drugs, well that's a different matter.
I can't stand these press people who throw a bunch of crap at the wall and call it "conspiracy".  Precision matters, individual charges must be considered uniquely and separately from each other.

One of the primary reasons for using Bitcoin is to not give private keys to every merchant, which is what credit cards do.  This nullifies that... so why bother?

Sales tax. It would be audited at random when the feds think you are cheating. It would produce a massive amount of revenue to the government due to boosted economic activity. See flat tax vs fair tax debate.

You should pull your coins.  Unlikely the guy will steal your coins, but also unlikely you will get your Trezor back.

You can't do business with any of the big banks.  They are constantly screwing people.  It's 2015 and BOA charges you a monthly fee just to have an account with them -- it's insane.
Go open up an account at a local credit union.
Also, if you are buying from your paycheck every time, checkout BitWage.  With this service you can take your bitcoin out of your paycheck before you deposit into your bank account.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:09:06
I think the reason Kim Dotcom likes Bitcoin is because the governments of the world took away his entire fortune, and he wants to actually have security over his money.  I don't think this is a pump and dump so he can cash out more dollars that the feds will just take from him again.

I would recommend Trezor to anyone. Would also advise to never use a wallet on your smart phone. Don't keep your coins on Coinbase or anywhere but your Trezor. Use multiple passwords. Spend your fiat while its worth something. Give a family member a written copy of your keys but don't tell them your passphrase.

It is a zero sum game, but the gains and losses are split in a zillion possible ways.  
Say I sold my Bitcoin to you at $317 when you first bought in, you have no idea what I originally bought at -- maybe I had bought at $30 a few years ago.  Then I buy more bitcoin back in at your $340 when you cash out -- I might sell at $600 a few months from now.  So I didn't lose in your scenario.

I watched this youtube video a couple weeks ago and thought it was great.  Good to see you post it here again.  
This "exit rights" thing is catching on I think.  One area I see it tremendously is in American politics and the rise of the Tea Party and independents leaving the Republican party in droves.  Why feel a sense of loyalty to a system that has no sense of loyalty to you?
The idea of United States, being actual states that are united, was a playground for the kind of experimentation that this article talks about.  If Maryland sucks (and it does), then people move to Texas.

The inability of governments to "interfere" is a key feature of why Bitcoin is succeeding. People don't like losing value in their money just bc government wants to spend beyond its means. This process of inflation and overspending is a devastating tax that is killing younger generations. Government just pretends that this printing serves a noble purpose but it doesn't.
