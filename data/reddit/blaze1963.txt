Yea, that'll be nice. It's not the cheapest I've discovered to use the third party

What exchange do you use for btc
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:21:34
Nope. Not your keys not your bitcoin .
I just buy some every month for my "savings account". % wise works out well.
It'll be my pension fund ��

I've held through loads. But this one is getting to me. I raod the way down to 3k. But for some reason this one has me like, fuck you. 
Maybe it's all the good news coming out and no movement.
No worries tho, I'll keep holding for another 5 years

I thought CB pro may have been a bit faster.
The thing that's got me is all other withdrawals have been very quick. 
I'll be patient

Sweet, shame I have no idea on how to start....

If you have added additional gpu to your rig. All you should need to do it relaunch the mining software and it should detect your GPU.
As long as you have the drivers installed

Most sensible thing I've read all day
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:42:30
Weak. 
Don't leverage trade. Just stack sats chill check your gains in 5 years

Some chap on youtube sold his btc 5k worth. PayPal said they don't deal with crypto and are holding is 5k for 180 days!! Just an fyi
@_date: 2019-10-12 11:52:44
Coinbase, and if you want cheaper use coinbase pro.
Make sure you get yourself a ledger or similar to get thr crypto off the exchange
