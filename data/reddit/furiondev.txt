This could actually boost it. From some points of view it helps grow - in the eyes of people who do not trust/support the government or corrupt expert economists. In the eyes of the old-fashioned (and let's be honest the percentage of this kind of people is not small at all) they will always stay away from it and be stuck in their own worlds and going through the routines of staying away of new things/tech.

The world is full of people that just want to brag and not do some actual work. Calling yourself an investor if you managed to make lucky $1k usd in three months due to Bitcoins rising is just not right. Just brag to yourself, you are the one who matters the most.

I think he is referring to "fear, uncertainty and doubt." There is always a chance that this strategy is being used to create disinformation and ruin BCHs reputation just as it is used in many other areas to create dubious information to make people stay away from it. 
Anyway, it's not about disliking Bitcoin Cash, it's about giving it some time to grow.

The real question is are they comfortable for doing a moonwalk? :)
All jokes aside, there's got to be a good amount of cryptolovers who are sneakerheads who would love your idea!

It does not necessarily mean that a lot of people will sell it, but there is this fear that BTW will plummet after reaching $10k that is wrapped around the community. The only thing guilty for any possible drop of the value would be said fear.
