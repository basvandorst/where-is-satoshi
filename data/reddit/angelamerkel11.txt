never used that. I sent the money.  Guess no better answer is coming in....
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:55:35
that's the best explanation so far. Probably not the real one. The volume is 7000BTC on bitstamp. Looks normal as hell. But I sent you the bounty if you provide an address...

sorry these volume numbers do change slowly and  can be foreseen.  Yes it's coincidence.    The event that triggered the spread increase must have been something UNEXPECTED!

Ok. I don't consider BTC-E a serious exchange. They are manipulating their volumes and just suck.  I still wonder who the hell is selling there?

sorry - doesn't explain the SUDDEN spread increase 36 hours ago.  
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:53:31
Yes in the last 10 minutes  already BTCE is about same as Bitstamp.   Well - guess just because of the recent selling on Stamp. But the Bitfinex - Bitstamp spread of way over 1% is now there for 2 days...
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:51:56
yes but if that is true the spread increase should have happened when the KYC bullshit started...

oh my god - Mr Bergmann. You make this even more embarassing...

50bits ty. I try it verify
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:48:51
ty, but i have my own formula  using the orderbooks of the major exchanges...
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:55:53
Good question
@_date: 2014-07-20 20:27:08
well germany has... 
They have a lot of stuff - but nothing what really interests me...
