 just rolled out at $50/week transfer limit for the protection of all of our users
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:34:07
I made StopCoin, happy to answer any questions you have
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:17:42
Your point is valid. How would you suggest balancing the risk/reward ratio here? I'm completely open to suggestions. I can understand how 'debiting an unlimited amount of money' as a permission could make someone very uneasy. That's the language that Coinbase provides with their API, perhaps we can do something on our end.
Why should should trust me – I'm a very transparent and active member of a few startup communities, in San Francisco, Boulder and elsewhere. You can find me on Twitter  You should trust me because my reputation is far more important than anything else. I've built a tool first and foremost to solve my own issues with bitcoin price fluctuations and through building this, I can help a lot of other people.
You can read the entire story of how StopCoin came to be here ( and decide for yourself if you want to use StopCoin and if I should be trusted.
Again, I'm completely open to suggestions to help users feel more secure once they've given us the permissions that they have. Maybe it's a limit that we build on our end so that you have StopCoin buy/sell limits rather than Coinbase buy/sell limits. That's an interesting idea.

Data security is our primary focus. We realize that building on top of Coinbase's API needs to be handled very carefully. All customer data, API keys, and balances are encrypted through a variety of different methods.
We require those permissions in order to buy and sell along the orders that you set as a user. There's no other way around it if we want to provide this functionality.
Additionally, we provide two-click account unlink, where all of your Coinbase credentials are fully purged from our servers. We cancel any pending orders and you get an email confirming that both have happened.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:01:57
While we still have a smaller order ledger, we rely on Coinbase and their API to do fulfillment. As you mentioned, we're only as reliable as they are. I'm sure they're working hard to reduce the amount of cases of failed orders.
Our goal is to be as transparent with you as possible should the order not go through and work quickly to make sure that it does in fact go through

Thanks Josh, I forgot about this. Thanks for the refresher. I'll make sure to add it to StopCoin so the user is well aware of this feature. Appreciate it
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:15:36
The number 10k
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:50:53
bittrex.com is good too. polo can be a lil sketch
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:20:20
We are so different ��
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:16:50
Some sure but some will come back 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:49:18
Wonder what they're waiting for
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:22:04
I'd be willing to bet that people will support both chains. BTC isn't some coin listing 300+ down in coinmarketcap, it's the big daddah
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:19:48
What % do UASF nodes have to get to before 8/1?
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:18:17
Of course. Then depending on the future value of each chain, my 5 is worth different amounts
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:11:11
The only place I think you're wrong is in the recovery time. A lot of new money excited to get in now, bubble or not 
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:42:57
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:39:34


@_date: 2017-06-27 16:20:05
Right. But if we're getting Segwit2x on or around 8/1, why would it still diverge and HF?
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:17:29
Then what does determine the outcome?
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:17:26
you're not being difficult at all. I welcome the debate.
I'm in the camp of "do what's least confusing to the non technical investors so this bubble doesn't pop, while also letting bitcoin improve"
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:39:15
Not trying to FUD, trying to learn
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:33:24
lol good point, also panic. 
That goes back to my original point though, Coinbase, given its position, should do all that it can so that there is no choice. That this is all resolved pre-8/1
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:51:15
spoiler alert: nobody knows!
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:22:05
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:32:11
Are Segwit2x and activating segwit 2 different things? The former is Barry's proposal from a few weeks ago, yeah?
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:47:45
No devs were involved and they have to implement this. Since this is open source software the "business people" can't just push what they want around without dev buyin
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:27:02
Thank you
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:48:24
If that's the case, in this whole years-long debate, we knew this 8/1 date was coming, why would the miners have waited until the very end before splitting? I guess just pure procrastination 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:24:17
Their risk increases tremendously if they offer a choice, tutorials, etc. People aren't going to read, they're going to panic and go "where's my money?"
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:17:00
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:44:29
Where's the date come from?
What if the activation window expires? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:00:43
Why does segwit have a date of 11/15? Isn't that arbitrary?
Thanks for the answers btw, just trying to make a strategy for all of this 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:13:48
Correct, I don't have evidence. I'm making the probabilistic case that they'll support the better chain (BIP148)
@_date: 2017-06-11 19:19:07
Thank you 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:11:40
This happened to me as well. I just contacted support. Hopefully they take care of this as well.
Correct me if I'm wrong but I believed (based on their messaging and the checkbox that I clicked) that I was owed my transaction amount divided by the price of BTC at the time of the transaction clearing. Not the flat amount of 2 BTC, regardless of price.
Bought Monday, payment cleared Thursday.
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:18:46
How are they going to explain to users like my co-workers who do sales and have little technical background why bitcoin now has 2 options and what those are and why?
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:09:58
This seems like the most likely scenario by far 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:27:44
Given the current rate of increase, that's not really that bold of a prediction...
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:41:23
That's a great tip. 
To your second point, that's a little bit of Baysian Statistics as well. Based on past events, what's the probability that this next event will happen. In general, it's a good lens to look at things through.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:41:02
Not a fan. Would go with Bitfloor. Coinbase is doing weird stuff right now with limiting buying, delaying payment requests. They've got a lot to work out on the tech side. It's only two guys right now too. I've been very happy with Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:48:36
A fair point. But like I said at the beginning, I don't know anything. These are my experiences. Don't listen to them, read them and then gather your own information. I could be completely wrong, your experiences should prove your own hypotheses 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:02:04
1) Define "lots of people"
2) Most will go away in time, or merge with others. Bitcoin is essentially the Coca-cola of the market. Litecoin will likely be the Pepsi. The first player in the market, if done well, generally holds 60+% marketshare. I see cryptocurrencies as no different 
If cryptos do catch on, it'll likely all be in BTC.
