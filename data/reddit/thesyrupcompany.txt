So why is it even inflated this much in the first place? Seems like a broken currency

Surely you are to give this response to a real question. Unless you can find me shit I can buy directly with Bitcoin, I don't see the value in it. It's like investing in an imaginary company.

I'll pass on that offer cause I'm not a sucker lol. Seems to me Bitcoin is just an endless circle of suckers raising the value of an imaginary virtual coin for no reason other than to buy more Bitcoin and raise the value more rinse and repeat

But what makes Bitcoin an asset in the first place? It all just seems imaginary to me. You can't buy anything with Bitcoin, you can only trade it for real money correct? So the value is just completely made up? At the end of the day, if I got 5 bitcoins in my digital wallet but no cash, I still can't buy anything can I? So I really don't have any money until I can manage to sell off my bitcoins to some anonymous rich guy online? I can't be crazy for thinking this all just seems made up. The Venezuela thing is pretty interesting tho. In that specific case I can see the value in Bitcoin, but still only kinda cause the venezualans storing their money as Bitcoin again still can't actually buy things so they may as well not have money.

Who's actually trading them?

Someone explain this to me? This Bitcoin thing has seemed like bullshit to me from the beginning. Like y'all are claiming one Bitcoin is worth $10,000 but how the hell do you determine that? It's not like u can actually buy anything with Bitcoin. Also, it's not like someone is gonna buy one Bitcoin for $10,000. There's not a single time where it would be better to have one Bitcoin over $10,000 actual dollars so what is the point and what determines the value?

Because you can buy physical product with cash, that's how. From what I'm understanding based on other explanations, Bitcoin you can't just walk into a store and use it, you can only trade it for dollars, so the whole thing is just imaginary value

That's a good point never thought of it like that

And the only thing that has come out of it all these years is it's imaginary value has gone up. It hasn't become a more practical currency at all, in fact it's gotten less practical over the years so all that means is millions of people are wasting their time, wake up.
