i thought bitcoin was created so government/banks can't interfere with its value? Its been banned, outlawed and dead for 10 years yet its all time lows keep raising. I would argue if congress starts passing down laws to ban bitcoin its yelling to the world it needs it more than ever.

The IRS didnt provide the guidelines until BTC was in the thousands, now they want a cut of the pie. I guess we are in the fighting stage?

I wish the guy replying gave him advice instead of criticizing how OP understood bitcoin. It doesnt help adaption when the bitcoin community act all high and mighty. HAHA you faxed your email. All it does is make banks look more like the better, convenient option and bitcoin the 'in your moms basement, screaming PC master race' internet fake money.

Initiation and finalization are different things. They don't even know if Bitcoin is a property or a currency. Why am I getting taxed for the trading Bitcoin if it's treated like a stock? If it's a currency why am I getting taxed if I get profit for holding, I don't get taxed for holding other Fiat. They just make the rules as they go, they haven't finalized anything.

Looks like bitcoin teaches you to live within your means or at least see necessity over luxury. 
Honestly, before bitcoin I would buy things i don't need to impress people who i  don't know with money i don't have.
Crazy to think I use to live like that.

Stay away, the government taxes you $.14 for every $1 you earn! That's right, That's only when you earn it, nevermind when you want to spend or put it in a non registered account. Lots of taxes to take away the $1 you earned with CAD.

Wrong, if it means that you can price out your competition its a plus.
If your lemonade taste the same at the guy next door and its priced cheaper, hell ya I'm going to you. 
You can price out the competition and get a bigger piece of the market share, will mean more profit than keep cost the same. Which means you can expand/hire to gain even more market share. More money for the business instead of fees is a business owners dream.

Why do they always associate bitcoin with Terrorist financing and money laundering? 
Did the FED somehow figure out to make fiat useless when it knows its geting money laundered or being used to fund terrorist. Fiat has been financing terrorists and money laundered since the dawn of time. What a dumb argument.

Theoretically, couldn't banks co-exist with bitcoin? Much like Postal and Email still exist, banks can still provide a service to the 'dumb'. Kind of how exchanges work now. I dont see them vanishing all at once either, just like the postal service they'll exist but play second fiddle, every generation getting smaller until bitcoin becomes to grandma easy. The government would have to change that much is for sure but again slowly, goverments at the pace of bitcoin would have to give up power and finally serve the people not the other way around as it is now. Although with the governments now serving the people, the people will have to more responsible with that power, there will be no/little government to help build roads, provide policing, healthcare etc. Will the people provide shelter to the homeless? be responsible with their own retirement plans? I don't know, but i hope we will.
The rich arent all in 1 team, the rich will fight for those 'smart people', if they do that means there is a competitive market and wages will be determined by that, not the rich CEO.
Rich people only pay politicians because rich people have given the government to much power. Take away that power and give it the people, the rich will take their attention else were. Think about it, if the goverment doesn't have the power to provide laws to cut corners for rich persons company, why empower the politician with bribery? Rich people aren't inherently evil corrupt overlords, they are just doing what they are good at, being cheap. If its cheaper to hire a bunch of engineers (now that the johns and janes can afford an education) than it is to pay a politician to pass a law to stay competitive. They'll take the cheaper route.

Bitcoin IS NOT GOING TO GET RID OF BANKS.
Postal services still exist even with email
Radio stations still exist even with streaming services
Theater still exists even with Movies/Television and they still exist even with Netflix, Peer to peer pirating. 
Bitcoin will not get rid of banks because Banks still offer other services that Bitcoin cannot.

2017 was the last bull run because the whole world knew what Bitcoin  was. Everyone that was in before 2016 has sold and they are not buying  back. They're millionaires. Everyone that bought at the top got burned  and are not going to be spend BTC anywhere. There is no analysis to be  made.. its just logical. BTC can't be a currency as no one wants to  spend theirs cause of this 'HODL' mentality and price jumps. It cant be a  security because it has no store value other than being a currency, but  its failing because of the reason mentioned. What you are seeing are  whales that missed the 2016 pump, so they are slowly bleeding/shorting  out what they can.  The ONLY people who have BTC now are people who  bought at the top that dont want to spend it cause of emotional attachment of 'its only a loss if you sell or  people that didnt sell before the drop and are 'HODL' waiting for new  whales to buy more.. but lets face it.. no whales or bulls are coming.  They left December 2017. Its over.
@_date: 2019-01-31 05:31:16
Im only being a realist. To the people who bought at the top, none of them just go walking around with 20k. These were loans, savings, mortgages and retirement plans being pumped into BTC. They have to recover that before even buying anymore BTC. I would say the majority of the world knows what BTC is now. The sad thing is the average person doesnt know how it works, they just know it as the bubble that took my friends savings. That 20k bull wasnt even organic, lets be real. Like I said the massive drop was from alot of pre-2017 adopters selling out. Theyre not coming back. I really wish you luck my friend, you really are going to have to hold for the long run. Side question. when the roman currency collapsed, the roman nation ceased to exist. WHEN the USD, the reserve world currency collapses, do you really think their will be internet and electricity? Do you believe btc will be any priority to survival of a global depression?

It depends on your time frame. If you expect to need your extra cash i would stick to your strat. If your timeframe is say 10 years I would just go all in. There is a study that 1 large lump sum is more benifenical than DCA, but it all depends on your time frame. In short, DCA if your time frame is less than 10 years. All in if you plan on holding +10.

then why not just put all your money in a savings account? 
Its a 2 edge sword, reward doesnt come without risk.
To completely close your doors in what might be 1 of humanity greatest invention is foolish.
To go all in a speculative asset is also foolish.
Risk what you don't have any emotional ties to and do your research.
