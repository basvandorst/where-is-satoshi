Conflating the gold standard with bitcoin is the issue here, not whether or not the gold standard was a thing.

It is if you're a classy mofo.

Fixed that for you... Or at least I wish everyone knew that this was the case.

Hurting foreign economies doesn't help the local one in the long run, it simply hurts everyone. You have to factor in the opportunity costs of ruining foreign economies, because they are usually far preferable to trade with when they aren't wrecked.

This happens to me constantly. Have an upvote.
I do disagree with you, though. I'm fine with this change happening, the CEO of Circle can say and do what he wants, but as an Anarcho-Capitalist, I will prefer to take my business elsewhere. At the end of the day, he's the one alienating a market by denouncing it and vocally admitting that he has no desire to please it.

As long as bitcoin continues to grow in popularity, those dirty tricks won't be of much significance.

An-Cap here. I'd actually be really interested to see statistics for this sub in particular, but I know that most bitcoiners worldwide are obviously not libertarians.

Thank you, that's very considerate of you to go through the effort of digging that up for me.

And for the record, despite barely saying anything, much of what he did say was false (such as the idea that Edison invented the lightbulb). It's quite funny in retrospect.

There are some historical examples of this, like in medieval Ireland. They had no police to enforce the law, because they opted to go about it through free association. The consequence for refusing to go through a trial process is that you would be exiled from society - nobody would do business with you or sell you anything, so you would either starve to death in your home, risk your life trying to steal things from people, or go into the wilderness to try to fend for yourself there.
All of those options are less favorable than going through the society's legal process, so the incentives are all adequate for this dynamic.

How was his example building on vaccination a poor one? The person you were discussing with didn't even mention their opinion on vaccination specifically, they drew it back to a core issue that they thought was the source of the problem in all examples: the idea that people need to be controlled.
