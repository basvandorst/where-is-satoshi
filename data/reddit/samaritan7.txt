I thought they payout the miners from a central wallet. But your statement makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:57:41
Aren't the miners too noisy to keep in a living room?

Oh! I found the D3 miner too noisy. Let me check if how to limit its hash rate.
Edit: Thanks for your comment!

Oops...sorry, I was wondering why Nicehash website is down for such long time. Didn't see that news on reddit until I found out about it on Google news. Thought reddit would be interested to know.

Sorry, I don't get it.

Me! Me! Me!

I don’t want to defend UAE, I know that it has certain drawbacks, but it’s not a Slave-based society.  I have been living here for 5+ years now and can attest that UAE is the most progressive middle east country.

Yes, any nationality can buy apartments in Dubai in all freehold areas. I guess such luxury apartments are usually sold to expats since locals stay in villas.

Sorry, I didn't mean to sound rude.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:45:03
This is a very valid advice. I agree. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:46:00
But let's not discredit the fact that the apartments listed with Bitcoin were sold.

When I tried to buy an apartment, HBSC wanted proof of funds to provide housing loan. I gave them a screenshot of my wallet and they were cool with it. Didn’t expect that to work.
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:26:24
The deal is that people are willing to sell apartments in bitcoin AND people are buying in bitcoins. Rest is speculation.

You can accept the payment and convert it to the currency of your choice. Talk to payment processors in your country.

That’s something the  9 million expats living there can answer :)
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:33:52
That’s a really neat idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:55:33
According to all news sources, they were priced in btc and sold exclusively in btc. My guess it that sellers should be clever enough to adjust the value according to the market.

I have 0.6. Planning to hold for a few years. Read some research that said bitcoin value could go up to $5million by 2030. Hoping to become a millionaire in 2030.

I am really sorry. I should have made an anonymous survey for this instead of asking everyone publicly. I just wanted to benchmark the level of risk people are taking so that I can decide if I should buy more bitcoin! Sorry!

Why don't you want to enjoy your money?

Oops! My bad.

Thanks for sharing the subreddit link. Subscribed.

Sorry. I understood that you have 2 bitcoins. The next statement is bit confusing.
