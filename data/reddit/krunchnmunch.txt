I just like it because of the direct transfer from your bank account.

Your username is absurd. I like you.

What site do you use to set up these orders? Coinbase doesn't have an option to adjust buy and sell price.

lol ok that makes sense why people are not doing this. 16 cents a hour isn't very good pay

Thank you. I bought some coin before the price jump and saved some $$. I used Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:01:22
Should I not be using Coinbase?

The ayahuasca plants look like a good/profitable investment.

I'm trying to play the market a little bit. Can you link me to that script? Thank you for the websites! I was oblivious to their existence. It seems like this little journey will be a load of fun. I like collecting shit and various other things as well.

This check4change thing confuses me. Do you care to indulge a little more?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:56:48
I still cannot believe this dramatic climb. It was 10 USD for 1 BTC back in November! I wish I would have invested all of my money on coin back then.

I'm just terrified of the  market stalling from this type of thinking.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:46:06
I'm not near one, but I think it may be worth the trip.

talk about two conflicting reports. Can I just walk into CVS and buy some coin? how does that work?
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:30:53
I'm assuming he bought 11 bitcoins
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:22:25
The only problem I have with coinbase is that it isn't easy to play the short term market. I can't set a buy order for $30/BTC or a sell order for $80/BTC. Do you just try to buy coin whenever the market drops and hope for the best?
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:32:53
I think this constant increase will continue. We will easily reach 2 Billion by the end of April. People are actually starting to realize bitcoin is a legitimate currency. I can't wait to see when bitcoin is accepted everywhere.

I will definitely test it out and message you feedback if an opportunity is available.
