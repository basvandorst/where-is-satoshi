I think you are misunderstanding what he is saying, he is saying the comment above ReigniningChamp4eva is ignoring the fact that these alt coins aren't being brought by one person, but have 60% of the transaction volume so their price is just as valid as bitcoins

its not related to that otherwise why would it have allowed monaco to become a VISA partner

interestingly this associated has been reducing quite a bit over the last week, bitcoin has been dropping and rising while most alts have been going flying
will be important to see how alts react to the next btc bull run, will they drop as standard history dictates or even chase btc, that will be decider IMO of whether bitcoin is still dominant or not

I must admit I am still struggling to see how lightning network fixes all the problems, as far as I can tell, you have to set up multi wallets for each lightning network channel which involves using a standard transaction to deposit money into the account. so it will only provide benefit if you frequently performing transactions in which case you have to reserve the cash flow.
how does that make the network perfect, surely standard fees which will be needed for most transactions?

will just say, that didn't matter back in altcoin winter everything dropped by 50% at least against bitcoin

high frequency just means it trades regular
i see two options here:
wash trading:
where a bot trades against itself to try to make it look like the current price has strong volume backing, illegal in stock market, perfectly fine in crypto but can cost a little bit (taker fees)
sell wall testing: 
this is a counter attack trading strategy which is built to stop sell wall accumulation bots which put up sell walls to look like there is a lot of sell pressure but remove them after a set amount of buys. the theory with the counter attack that its the cheapest way to get the wall to be retracted without spending much

but my problem is people wont want to use it for transactions with companies,
for any cost savings to be achieved you will have to deposit money into the multi sig address more than one transactions worth
that means lets say i go to a corner shop once a month, for me to get any savings there i would have to deposit lets say 12 months worth of spending
can someone tell me if I am missing something here because otherwise i only see this really working for big companies and even then, I know for certain i dont want to say have to deposit 150$ worth of btc into a macdonalds LN address just to have cheapis macdonalds transactions

every time someone says it will be a million, it means one of two things:
either they think all fiat currency will become worthless, so a one million bitcoin isnt as big as it sounds because a current 100,000 house will cost 10 million
or they dont realise that currently there is only about 90trillion dollars in the world and that a 1 million valuation would mean bitcoin would be 1/4 of the money in the world. I can tell you now there is no way in hell the blockchain will be ready to support pretty much all of transaction in the world going through it within 4 years, lets be a bit more reasonable

yeah I think most of us realise that our portfolio going up 3x in the last month is a sign of a serious bubble, but who knows if it will 2x again before its drops down again,could lose your shirt shorting

yeah, its funny how ultimately you can really see this going down a dystopian future where fedcoin allows the government to shut down your ability to purchase anything at any point

agree with your point, but there are quite a few altcoins that can scale over 100 tx/s already, in fact there are several that have been tested past that; raiblocks, iota hell, even ripple,

yeah the flash crash stuff is the big thing, these flash crashes are getting a bit silly considering the market size we now have, I know GDAX is putting down circuit breaker equivalents for similar reasons, and honestly I'm all for it

getting it as well as of this evening, can confirm was working fine yesterday for me
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:01:23
you can't list any number though, only what you have, and that would mean someone would have to have a crazy amount of bitcoin, and why would someone like that want to keep the price low
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:01:13
haha, yeah it shows the arrogance of the people in these reddit forums that they honestly think from here some shit on here that they know more than hedge funds who do it for their job.
that being said the returns were pretty poor, 1400% in one year, means they must have been pretty much holding only bitcoin or had alot of cash on the side
