Coinbase is crooked. Someday, the rubes might figure it out.

Great post. I hope this is on topic.


I saw this posted here on reddit a couple of weeks ago and saved it. 


















Number 6 alone is something that's only really come into existence for computer users in the past 15 or 20 years. Before that, crypto signatures and good encryption in general were only available to militaries,  governments and large corporate entities. The rise of crypto is leveling the playing field. That alone has great value.
Bitcoin has two revolutionary traits: the blockchain and the removal of human caprice from the issuance of currency. The second trait is the one that will ultimately change everything, for better or worse. Hopefully for better.

Growing pain issues are when  this happens a few times and then it gets fixed. Coinbase is operating a flimflam scam in the legal gray areas brought on by Bitcoin. 
Do continue to do biz with them if you wish. It's your choice to be abused in the chance you might get a bitcoin.

When Coinbase takes an order from you, your money is held up for days. Coinase is using your market order as cash and cutting itself and its larger customers in on the action while the little customers, whose money Coinbase has been using for market operations, get screwed with a "your order has been cancelled".
This generation of Americans is so used to being scammed and ripped off that they can't tell when  it's happening to them anymore.

Do I really have to explain why Coinbase is crooked?

These issues involve peoples' money. They need to be fixed now. No one would put up with this service from a bank or any financial concern.

.00023 cents. Still too much.

They're crooks. They steal and lie.
That's crooked.

How can coinbase be the easiest way to get bitcoins when people aren't even assured of getting what they were promised in the first place?
@_date: 2013-02-28 19:41:35
If you want to buy bitcoins at 2.99% below market, look up Tangible Cryptography on bitcointalk.org. $500 minimum order, same day.
Coinbase is a ripoff.

So if I promise you something, take your money and use it for my own purposes so that I profit but return your money without also giving you what I promised and, in the meantime , I got richer from using your money while you became worth a little less...
that would be ok with you?

There are easier ways to get bitcoins than to tie your bank account to a shady operation.
