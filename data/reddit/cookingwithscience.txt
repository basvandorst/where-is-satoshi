coinjar is probably best for Australia you do have to verify though

A quick search of "Igot" in this sub and there are multiple people complaining. I've been having trouble withdrawing my bitcoin for nearly 4 days now

Not sure what you are getting at

The only problem I have with using bitcoins to buy food is I have to pay a 2% fee to get bitcoins. That's alright for drugs but I can buy food for 2% less

i understood that but say when transferring 1BTC from a 5BTC paper wallet   then finding the change address for the 4BTC left over and creating another paper wallet from that address and finding the private keys is completely confusing me. In that thread i linked a lot of people were asking the same question but i didn't understand the explanation. I will probably experiment with some tiny amount to fully get my head around it

Thanks for the reply.
I've just been reading through the Electrum tutorials seems like it will solve all my problems with using a paper wallet. I have a raspberry pi lying around that i could use as my offline wallet
