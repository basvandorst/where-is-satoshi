Renben is making you do homework. While I don't disagree and would suggest you try to read mises' regression theorem, a quick summary:
Money always starts as a commodity that is valued for its ability to be used as a unit for bartering. Initially Bitcoin was used as a medium of exchange for drugs (this is before the famous pizza purchase)
As people exchange bitcoins for different commodities, they recall the previous exchange value of the coin. This leads to a sort of price history that allows people to interpret bitcoin as a store of value
More and more people are buying bitcoin now. Higher demand with a relatively stagnant supply means that the price has to increase, all other things being equal (yes, nowadays there are altcoins. But altcoins are not the same as Bitcoin just as Sprite is not the same as diet Coke)
As demand increases, the price of goods and services go down (I'd argue that purchasing power doesn't exist in Austrian economics but it has been years) this might mean people may not spend for fear of missing on a deal tomorrow. However people eventually need things and will spend. This stabilizes the price of Bitcoin.
Anywho in the future *if* Bitcoins become a very popular medium of exchange and its purchasing power continues to appreciate over time, this helps the average Joe who cannot afford to buy stocks. Currently there are no worthwhile savings accounts. A person with low or fixed income is motivated to spend as prices will go up relative to their income due to inflation.
Bitcoins will serve as a sort of savings account. If deferring consumption of luxuries means a lower price, this incentivizes the person on fixed income to save. That's good for their options during time of disasters.
Sure they won't make 50000% return on investment, but they also won't lose 3-7% to inflation either

sauce: i do wire things sometimes for a bank
Suggestion for people who are sending wire payments to bitcoin exchanges:
First, screenshot or have the webpage with payment details opened. I have heard stories from misspelled company names to missing "for further credit to bank B" and now a misspelled financial institution, which is strange since you (OP) must've provided a swift code and that stuff should auto populate. (edit - read to the bottom; it didn't apply and likely can't apply as an issue)
Once you have signed off on the payment ask the teller to request two things: first, your bank's wire reference number - this allows you to follow up if something goes wrong and second, a printout of the swift message - this allows you to review the details of the payment and will let you skip a trip to the bank. Note the swift message may not be available until a couple business days later
In the case where a wire is not received, the wire reference number has been provided to the bitcoin exchange, and all payment details as detailed on your swift message are confirmed accurate, you can then go to your bank and request that the wire be traced and/or reversed. 
In OP's case I would immediately request a trace request as the money is *somewhere* - if your bank has already credited some other bank's account with money, that credit should have included the payment instruction. 
Best case scenario is: funds were transferred to Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal /s (SMBC) and some other payment detail is preventing them from crediting Kraken's account. Hell, just ask the teller to call whoever is in the wires department. Maybe SMBC sent a message to your bank saying "oy, this here [detail] is amiss. pls fix".
If no such case has been opened, then you can pursue either a trace request to find out what happened to the money, or just ask for the money back. Since we don't know what is the issue (as I said and as you said, the swift code should have [found the correct financial institution]( you cannot send an amendment to your payment instruction. Good luck and if there are updates feel free to PM

I've got to agree with Vespco here. If somebody managed to steal the winklevoss twins' coins (just go with me here) would they ever be able to sell them on the market and would anybody want them?
or a slightly different example: if satoshi's coins (however we would determine this - maybe block  ? suddenly got spent, wouldn't we put value on those coins?
It's like how USD is basically fungible but it wouldn't be if we were able to track money based on serial # or something of that sort.
In normal day-to-day trade, I guess bitcoins are fungible in the sense that 1 btc is 1 btc but that's not what I'm talking about.

Just reading this thread, some general security thoughts:
If you are going to keep your crypto on a usb drive (which is perfectly fine) at least encrypt the damn usb drive, and make sure it is never left unsecured and plugged into a device.
You can upload your keys and wallets to storage sites like google drive and drop box *if* you encrypt the files before doing so (and make the files less obvious - ie don't call it wallet.dat.veracrypt) - I do this: the file is never on my computer longer than it needs to be.
Have offline, off site backups. A bank safety deposit box + encrypted hard disk drive or SSD (depending on size restrictions) is more than enough. USB drive in safety deposit box probably okay. Check on them annually. Virus scans.
Checking the wallet file regularly is good in the sense that you are performing disaster recover processes, but just looking at your balance on blockchain is often good enough.
Borrowing money is risky. Make sure that if you suddenly enter a bear market that you are able to pay off your debts, and realize that without an emergency fund or without regularly taking profits, you can't buy dips and crashes.
Do not be other people's banks unless you are neurotic enough to manage people's money. You aren't a bank - you are an individual who might be more tech savvy than more techies. It's just not worth the headache. Obviously, make different wallets for different people if you are going to do this.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:21:53
You're right, but with something that returned 500% you might want to keep some as a hedge against higher future returns.
I have a friend who had 10, and due to real life issues sold 9 for 19000$ ( ea) and kept one.
I told him to hold that last one but he sold it before the earlier market correction/dip/whatever. Still a good overall return on investment.
Personally I would've sold 0.5 bitcoins at the most had I been in his position. Or just hold onto it and see if it hits 40k
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:54:09
did they have bitcoin miner calculators back then? the calculator alone would have told you that the miner would not return a profit. O.o
like, my S9 will probably barely break even by the end of next year - expecting somewhere between 0.7 - 0.9 bitcoins if I'm lucky
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:17:59
i think downvoting posts like this as "fud" is silly. This sub is fond of dollar cost averaging. What if I argued that not DCAing nets you higher gainz and so DCA is silly? Well that's just ridiculous, isn't it?
Personally I would say to set up in advance your preferred distribution of investments. Say, 50% home, 20% funds, 20% stocks, 10% "whatever" (bitcoin) and if your "whatever" balance starts to increase in value past 10% of your net worth, sell some and dump it in funds/stocks until it balances out.
If you have 100% in bitcoin, that's fine too, but at least acknowledge you are in a high risk situation
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:58:27
If you are pegging the price of Bitcoin to today's price, i wouldn't be that quick to celebrate. If prices double and your boss still owes you 0.1 Bitcoins per pay period (or something) you might get fired. If prices crash you will be poor.
I would have negotiated something like (x USD in Bitcoin at the market rate at time of payment) which would be fair for both parties.
Either way, good luck op

What sort of price correction or crash are we talking about?
If it crashes to the point where we're in a year long bear market, I can buy up lots of bitcoins next year. Much more than if the price keeps going up.
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere even if it does crash. It will reach higher ATHs. Besides, what reason would there be of a crash? We just got regulated futures market and governments everywhere are acknowledging it. It's past the point where it's just magic internet money that only a select few talk about.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:14:21
I'll bite.
Bitcoin is like (but isn't identical to) money in that if you don't spend it, it does not affect the market because the coins aren't circulating
If the twins never cash out it would be as if the coins were lost. If they sold it all, even if they did it over the counter, I think eventually somebody is more likely to spend those coins, and so they will drive prices up

bitcoin's "use value" is that it is a cryptographically secure medium of exchange that cannot be meddled with. it has a supply that cannot be inflated into oblivion and it is pseudo anonymous.

if he "found it" (marginal tax rate?) he'd pay higher taxes than if he had "mined it" (long term capital gains) - since he can prove he mined it, I'd go that route
he'd have to file amended taxes for the year where he mined the bitcoins but his CPA relative could help him do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:47:13
I think s7 are still profitable. S9 are definitely still profitable but you would have made more money holding it (though if we don't get a correction in a year you will mine more coins than you paid)
Would recommend you research mining for a few days and think hard about it.

I'm going to be generous and agree that you should diversify your coins
But Ver is notorious for basically hating on Bitcoin "core" and claiming his coin is superior. So it stands to reason that if he were consistent, he'd sell everything and put his money on altcoins.
Now if he wanted to change the Bitcoin code to fit with his preferences, then keeping Bitcoin makes sense.
To me it just seems disingenuous, like buying Microsoft stocks while hating on them and saying Apple OS is both superior and the way of the future.

traditional money emerged from a physical commodity that had its own use value (farm animals like goats, silver, gold, etc) which had various properties that made it useful as a universal medium of exchange.
people are confused by bitcoin because it has no intrinsic use value that people readily understand (you can't eat it, basically /s) but what people aren't realizing when they say bitcoin can't / isn't money is that they ignore that bitcoin is a great and cryptographically secure ledger in addition to a currency; it's BETTER than gold and any other historical examples of money. that's its use value.

Watching bitcoin adoption (really, moreso ever-increasing demand / price) made me wonder if gold "prices" were the same back in the barter era.
Surely at first people traded large nuggets of gold for trivial things, and only when widespread adoption/usage dwindled the supply per person did the price of gold stabilize. Same as the 10k/2 pizzas barter.

It, like virtually all commodities, will go through dips and come out ahead.

Especially considering how much "profit" you'd be getting buying at a slightly lower but not guaranteed price. Are you trying to buy at 100-200$ less? Will that even translate to anything more than 50$ when btc sells at 10k? Just take that 30 bucks and enjoy it

Paypal may be "cheaper", but try transferring several thousand dollars randomly on paypal. I remember one time my sister in law wanted me to convert her money into USD. 
This was long before bitcoin besides she wouldn't know how to buy it. Anyway, I told her to hold on and not do anything while I gathered my banking info - she goes ahead and sends some 30 thousand dollars via paypal.
The call to paypal HD the next day was not fun. They froze the transaction as suspicious (duh) and reversed it.
If she had sent the money via bitcoin it would've been over with in a few minutes without any hassles or any company crying about purpose of payment and other hogwash.

[this]( post from 2014 is saved and I assume is more or less still accurate.
Seems to be that the moment you exchange bitcoins for anything (promisory notes of USD, an ~~shit~~ alt coin, goods and services) you may incur a realized gain. That is taxable.
As for alt coins and whether all crypto are like-kind, it's answered as well, but I would've said that it's taxable.
For example when bitcoin cash was in that surge recently I exchanged bitcoins for bitcoin cash and vice versa, netting a small % profit. That's taxable. Or, let's say you had a limit sell order at 7k or whatever the last ATH was (I'm canadian so the number was 10k for us) and then bought back at the dip, there's a gain there.

I was dealing with some RL shit last year, so I didn't even look at btc prices; I forgot about them after the 3000$ ATH. I probably would've bought a few and be pretty good today.
But that's not something I can do anything about. Plus if we think that btc will shoot up to 25, 50k each one day, it doesn't matter that we missed the 250/500$ boat - we can still head to the moon together.

Bloomberg headline: bitcoin crashes 30% after YTD 1000%. IS BITCOIN FINISHED?
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:49:37
Take an affordable fraction of a bitcoin, like oh, 0.01 or 0.02 btc, and buy it every x period, like your pay period. If the price goes up, you spend a little more, but if there's a price dip, xxx btc costs less than it did the previous 2nd week/month/whatever.
The con side is that if bitcoin goes up considerably (think about how quickly it went up from 4000 to 7000) you will not have made as much short term money as you would have going all in on day 1. But the advice to average out your purchases is to mitigate the alternative of the price going *down* during the same period of time, which could very well happen.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:55:45
Bear in mind I don't believe what I'm saying, only that OP is asking for devil's advocate responses. Regarding  I would instead suggest the following:
The majority of bitcoin buyers are expecting the price to go up, which means they expect that somebody else in the future will pay more for bitcoin. Similar to gold and commodities, if there were any steep crashes, there would be many people left holding the bag while the early sellers reap profits and jump ship.
The counter to that of course is that all investment is speculative to a degree and that there is always the risk of losing most/all of your money. Nobody who is sane would claim that bitcoin is a guaranteed profit machine 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:53:05
I quite enjoyed the BCH surge. I kept flipping BCH for bitcoin and vice versa (honestly, a scary adventure) and managed to squeeze out some 0.xxx btc profit for basically doing nothing. Then I just had to watch BCH crash while BTC stabilized and went up.

Lots of people tried shorting collateralized debt obligations before ... 2007 crash? It wasn't a dumb move, since mortgage backed securities were doomed to fail. The problem was timing the market since shorting CDOs was expensive.
Say you took out 325k equity loan and put it in bitcoin. A lot of things can go wrong. bitcoin could dip and you won't get your money back for months or years. Meanwhile the bank notices what you did and demands you pay back your debt. You can't, because now you're upside down and underwater.
*That's* why people are saying he was foolish. Yeah he profited at the end. But then when people tried to short the housing bubble back in the 2000s many people ran out of money and lost it all. Not everybody is going to be Steve Carrell and Ryan Reynolds.

If you are selling gold for money (breaking the ToS) then whatever you make is taxable.
If you are ~~buying gold from world of warcraft or~~ selling gold for game time, that is not a taxable event per se. But you could argue that selling gold for game time has a real world value of.. 18.99 or whatever it is per month. If you wanted to pay taxes on *that* go for it.

it's all relative. granted you won't get ... 13? times your investment if you bought now (barring some sort of insanity) but you can still get &gt; 7% return, and really, what are your mutual funds and stocks giving you?

@_date: 2017-10-22 07:02:40
the ELI5 is that you can't know in advance how high it will go, so you should sell once you have realized you have profited due to rapid price appreciation.
Hindsight is 20/20 - let's take this year as an example. You buy in Jan/Feb for ... I dunno, 1000$ and you see it go up to 5500$. You've made 550% profit which is insane (mutual funds being average 7%)
You also think that it will go higher. After all at 5500 segwit2x nov hard fork hasn't happened yet and you predict the value might be higher leading up to it / afterward when bitcoin core is proven to be superior and resistant to "attackers"
But on the other hand, it could dip below 5500 and there goes your 550% return. So you sell at 5500. Now you're holding presumably a pile of cash.
The price keeps going up. So what? You still profited.
The price dips and doesn't go up to 5500 for 3 years. you sigh a breath of relief.
Either way, you profited.

You still need to spend in a deflationary economy - you have to eat, pay bills and rent, and invest.
That said, let's say you can make 8% in a savings bond or savings account, which my mother told me was the case back in the 80s. You give the money to the bank and let them figure it out.
In the case of bitcoin at some point you'll still have to buy food and pay bills, and luxuries.

b) if you install your own bitcoin wallet on your computer, you can transfer that Bitcoin on to your computer. That way you are about to survive exchanges going bankrupt and or getting hacked
This is probably your biggest hurdle. What you can do *tonight* is look up some Bitcoin wallets and install them on your computer. You won't have any bitcoins to mess around with but it should be your first step.
c) who knows? That's why you should follow my advice in b)
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:10:05
I'd be more worried about the state of the economy at that point. One part of me conflates bitcoin's rising prices with distrust of fiat money, and the other understands that the more bitcoin is accepted, the more stable the economy (bitcoin economy and the economy of interpersonal exchange) - mostly because nobody can fudge the supply of btc
That said, if a bitcoin ever got to 100k and price inflation wasn't the reason, I think we'd all be too busy partying than being smug.

Keep it in your own wallet where you have the keys safe. Right now research into how to split your coins safely as you will likely have a bunch of extra coins, projected to occur late October to mid November.
During that time likely there will be wild price swings as people figure out what's going on. After that you should be okay.

You "should never" put 100% of your investment income / extra money into a particular investment. 
Incoming downvotes.
When I was looking into day trading I ran into this idea of dollar cost averaging. Basically you put x% into a stock (or bitcoin) and if the price goes up, you profited. If the price goes down, you can put more into that stock (or bitcoin) and offset the loss by selling when the price goes up.
If you spend every cent you have on bitcoin you can't buy when the price crashes and you'll have to time the market or sell while the price goes up (make less profit otherwise). Plus you'd be staring at the prices every other hour worried about a 10% dip. That's stressful.
On the other hand, if you put 100% of your money into an investment and it goes up, you've maximized your possible return. Supposedly this is the counter argument to dollar cost averaging - that you aren't maximizing your returns if the stock went up that day

Say you were on a lifeboat. You have decided to trade using money for some reason and have valued a child sized life jacket for 100$, which was all the money that you could find in your suitcase.
Suddenly somebody finds... Not a child sized life jacket but a flutterboard. You want both but can't buy both if the price of the lifejacket stays the same.
In only that situation (a static amount of money) will a competing commodity/ forked coins' result in a subtraction of value from Bitcoin. In reality people can bring in money from outside the Bitcoin economy to keep the Bitcoin price stable.
edit: I forgot the second half of my story (it was used to explain of all things, how people price goods in an economy) - let's say you were going to pay 100$ for the life jacket and then saw the flutterboard. The distribution of price afterward might be 70$ life jacket 30$ flutterboard (there are no other buyers) - but then you check your pockets in your suitcase and find an extra 30$. Voila - the price of the life jacket stays at 100$ and you offer 30$ for the flutterboard.

Buy a tiny amount of post fork Bitcoin, like 0.001 or whatever you can spare, and move it into your pre fork wallet. Then you can move the entire balance into a new wallet without worrying about replay attacks since you won't have x+0.001 btg or segwit2x coins or whatever. Now you are free to import keys into the fork wallet.
Would be cool if somebody confirmed this advice as legit

Hmm. You're right
There goes that fantasy

Re: Max return
I just meant that in an ideal world you buy at the lowest price and sell at the highest. DCA doesn't let you do this but in exchange you risk goes down.

The fees at most exchanges are so low that you could put 100$ in and make 100$ and get out. Of course (legally speaking) you'd owe like 7$ to the gov't from that 100$ but that's still 90 whatever dollars cash money you can spend at mickey d's

This is why you "should" sell on the way up. Only HODL if you have money to buy when it crashes, or if you don't need the money and can ride out the bears

3 years ago when bitcoin crashed ~50% this sub had links to suicide hot lines. The adage of "HODL" doesn't help when people are overleveraged and have invested their entire savings / net worth into this thing.
If somebody were to say HODL damnit it will double its ATH in 3 years, noboody would believe them or would say "what could you be basing that on? Nothing. Now go away"

I'd argue that people who are already/naturally against tribalism are drawn to bitcoin
I tell people that it isn't a "get quick rich scheme" as much as it's a way to send your mother in [home country] several thousand dollars, in a few minutes (seconds), without a bank holding funds, asking questions, jerking you around....

Sure, they could get 51%. We could also just fork the coin.
Also, it would be incredibly expensive to maintain 51% consensus. And the *moment* they stopped doing it, everything will become undone. It's not worth it.
