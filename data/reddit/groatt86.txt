It is very possible, it is also possible government will join together to crack down and bitcoin goes to &lt;1k$, it is hard to tell. Tesla stock is something that will stay stable because of their massive resources and tech. It is safer to diversify investings, put 20-30% of your yearly investing money into crypto if you like but the rest should go to ETF's and platinum stocks like Tesla, google, apple, etc.

Bitcoin is going to hit 1-2K$ by end of the year, the goal was to wipe out all the small time investors and take their money.

That's not how markets work. There is no guarantee it will go one way or the other, nothing is certain. 
Looking at the chart now, it is testing  a major support level of 11.4k$, this is the support level that has stayed for last few days after it had crashed to 9k$ earlier this week. 
If it dips below 11k$ then that is a major worry since the next support level is the 9k$ range.

Bitcoins real value is around 4-6k, the spike over the last few months was typical pump and dump day trade strategy, happens countless times every day and week. I think it will hit somewhere between 1-4k in next 6 months and then stabalize around 6k and then maybe in 2-3 years it will hit 20k again.

Tesla shares are high but they are justified, they could be a multi-Trillion$ company in a decade or two if things pan out.

Bitcoin is going to hit 1-3k, the crash has barely even started. All the small fish are panic selling.

Its crashing nearly 10% a day, should have waited another week or two, I feel like Bitcoin will flash crash now that it is 10k as all the small fish will panic sell. I think I will buy in when it hits 3-4k.

It is gonna hit 2-4k$, the goal of this drop is to wipe out all the small time investors, happens every day in stock market.

No, it can't ever be that, and never will. But it can be a good long-term investment. They are not comparable, Tesla created an entire new industry on its own, and this industry has no limit to its potential.

It hit 9k today, then back up to that critical 10k support level. If it dips below 9k tomorrow that means the support has evaporated and it is hard to tell how far it will crash, 1k bitcoin is a very real possibility. We will see tomorrow and most importantly friday before trading closes to see where it will head. If Bitcoin is below 9k on end of trading friday afternoon, it is going to be a massacre next week.
