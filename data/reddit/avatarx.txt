There are 3 very simple things that need to happen for Bitcoin to be used 10x more broadly than now: 
1.- The MC/NSM of Bitcoin needs to be at least $100B USD. Otherwise, there are tons of things that cannot happen.
2.- Buying/Acquiring Bitcoin needs to be as easy as it is Spending/Selling it. This is still not the case. Progress has been made, but it is still multiple times easier to spend bitcoin than acquiring it. 
3.- Usability in general needs to reach certain thresholds:






Point 1 will come naturally as points 2 and 3 are realized. And they are things that are now in the way to materialize. I think we are 2 years from seeing point 2 and 3 to fully arrive.

Yeah, there has not been a Humble Bundle with Bitcoin enabled in over a month. Before that, the last 2 that had Bitcoin as a payment option, only had it enabled during the first 3 days. Now, not even that. Really unfortunate. At least, when it comes to Games, we got several options.

Why would Blockchain.info go out of business? That is the beauty of their situation. They don't hold funds and they gets tons of traffic that they can monetize. Their costs for actually running the site are low. Their big expenses they have are all probably being around in all conferences.  Also, if there is a startup Roger Ver would want to fully own just for the sake of it, it would be Blockchain.info.  Its chances of going away are really low. Or at least, I don't see how they can just go away. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 20:01:44
No. 
Roger Ver just favors a certain version of looking at Bitcoin. What is interesting, is that if he had got involved into steering the development back in 2014, he probably would had been able to have it his way. But in 2016. He just don't has enough money or clout to be able to do so. And the way he tries to engage nowadays is almost Anti-PR. Causing enough confusion, that such a question like this is posted to every now and then.

Well, I don't personally would wear one. But I knew a guy who sold them and I have seen a good replica and an original side by side. Unless you open them or inspect them from very close and you happen to be knowledgeable about watches, you will not be able to tell. And most of the time celebrities actually wear replicas on their everyday life and only use the real things in events. Specially when it comes to those stupid blinged-out watches. And most of the time, they are only loaned to them. They don't even own the originals, only the replicas.

You other choice would be paxful. Or going from skrill to other thing like neteller and then to bitcoin via localbitcoins or paxful. But in either way, going from any online money wallet to bitcoin is always going to be more expensive than from cash/deposit/transfer to bitcoin. That is just the way it is because of the chargeback risks.

Unfortunately. The only app where you can get the btg and bch at the same time is coinomi as far as I know. It is also the only one with a good enough track record. At least so far. But, like I said, just secure the bitcoin by moving it into another wallet first and then claim the bch and btg via coinomi. When it comes to multicoin wallets. because of the way they handle things. They should be considered high risk by default. As they are a lot harder for devs to secure while at the same time they keep adding and supporting new coins.

Don't listen to dumb rumors. No one controls Bitcoin. And No, satoshi don't has a special password for controlling the Bitcoin network. In fact. Since Satoshi went away more than 60% of the code of Bitcoin has been changed. Less than 40% of the code of Bitcoin resembles what the code was prior to 2010.

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:25:52
That's not how it works. the bch and btg stays tied to your wallet/private key that had bitcoin when those forks happened. You need to move your bitcoin to a new safe wallet and the input the private key in a wallet like copay for the bch or coinomi for both bch and btg.  Caution, security and care while doing this is for you to take on.

Yes. Code gets rewritten to optimize it, to add features. etc. The code it is right now managed via GitHub. Everyone can make a change. But that don't means every change is accepted. Changes to the code are reviewed and tested before it gets merged. What prevents people from messing with the code is that anyone can review, test and audit the code being added or that was added.

For example I put USD or MXN and it show how much it is at each. But not only that.

I really lament when someone uses the Friendster &amp;/or Myspace analogies for Bitcoin. Because it is intellectually lazy and not an applicable analogy in the first place. The same goes for when someone uses the napster analogy. 
In the case of Friendster. The only "social networks" before it from where it took ideas were dating sites and user profile listings. That is it. 
In the case of Bitcoin you got a whole stream of antecedents before it. Bitcoin unique innovations are that it was birthed with the blockchain and from a Decentralized P2P perspective. 
But when you look at antecedents for Bitcoin. You find a 20 years history of antecedents. 30 years if you also include just concepts and research, but that would be too much. Here are just the ones I can remember from the top of my head: Flooz, Beenz, ISK, Wow Gold, e-Gold, Liberty Reserve Dollars, The Linden Dollar, Digicash, bitpass, b-Money, bitgold (even if in concept) and the bitcent. The last 3 examples were also more like research antecedents, but they were still important in the road to Bitcoin.

Looks really good man. You finally did it. Am impressed with the proper IE support.  Only IE error is that the center screen view mode tags linger on instead of fading away like they do in Firefox or Chrome. If that can be fixed, then it will be as perfect as it can be.

I like it and it is a lot better than Coinmap. To encourage you and prove I do like it. I have added it as replacement for Coinmap in The G+ Bitcoin Community (15K+ members) about card. 
I do have a serious dislike for Coinmap. Previously I had cointerest instead until they went away. I got two suggestions though: 
1.- Add a Merchants Total Count somewhere at the bottom.
2.- Add a Donation Address with QR-code to it.
Oh, and have 1 internet @_date: 2015-06-27 04:52:42

Yes, it is possible for non-money related stuff. And even then it is not practical without incentives.  The perfect example of a development that is not bitcoin or money related but uses a blockchain would be Twister. And even in it there is both a clear purpose and utility to run a node and clear incentives for when it comes to mining

Ah! Well, I guess it is because for me things like having to split up pocket change and coping up enough exact change to pay an odd or exact amount are still not rare things since I do use cash on a daily basis. This joke revolves around turning the table on both of those things. And as an extra bonus, I used to annoy a local grocery store owner as a kid as I purposely paid him in 50 cent coins whenever I could and every time I made sure one or two fell over his side of the counter. In my case, that is why I find it funny.

The chances for High Fidelity to become an actual open virtual world are close to none right now. it's focus is really about personal virtual worlds. I think it could find success as a platform to quickly mockup, develop and test assets. But even for that it is still not there.

@_date: 2015-06-12 08:37:54
Nielsen's Bandwidth law disagrees with you. But it is why I think starting with 4mb first is better too. 16MB BSI would only be until 2020.

I concur with the 4MB block size increase as being the way to go for a first increase move. It has been my opinion since the debate started. I always have been in favor of the block size increase. Just not of a 20MB BSI. Another observation I have come to terms is that a way to make it sustainable for the long term future is it having a 50% automatic BSI every 2 years. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:35:59
I see no one gave you a serious answer, so I will:
The only choice right now is the S7 Antminer that costs like $1.5K USD if you can get one. But it is only a recommended purchase if you got cheap or free power and if you got somewhere dry but ventilated where to put it.  Otherwise your chances of a ROI are slim.
Knowing this, is up to you to do the math and take the risk with one. If you do, buy only from the official site or you will get ripped off.

It was not designed for that. It was meant for The Linden Dollar first and foremost. When it comes to Bitcoin it is a workaround. 
The best workaround was those 6 months that flattr accepted Bitcoin. You could then securely exchange Bitcoin to paypal without a worry. The only downside to it was that you could only do the trick once a month.

I was not an early miner. Wish I was though. But because I was very early into Bitcoin, I managed to collect lots of them for free. But I sold most way too early. The result? Am not Bitcoin Rich.  :(

I remember that in late 2011. Someone suggested 1.1M BTC to be the amount that satoshi could had mined. However, I also have read every speculation on the subject since then and right now I believe 600K-800k would be a whole lot more likely from back then. 1.1M BTC seems WAY too high. Specially if they are meant to be unmoved. How many private keys belonging to how many wallets we would be talking about for they to have been able to remain hidden would then become the question.  So, I agree and share your skepticism.

Excellent. Before today, I recommended Electrum and Blockchain.info to newbies for their spending wallets in the case of Desktop, Web and Mobile. Now, I think Copay is what I will be recommending. It could not be simpler to use or easier to learn how to use it. All while being secure too.

Mexican brand of hams, sausages, cheese &amp; prepacked pizzas.  FUD as coined in 1954 stands for Fine, Unique &amp; Delicious.

No, they had a hack where they lost bitcoins from their hot wallet and they actually were growing too fast and monetized late and timidly. They suddenly got close to losing money and they didn't had a way to turn it around. Whatever they were offered to buy them out was obviously not enough, so they just went away.

Not quite.  Release Candidate means it is feature complete for a 1.0 version. Do still agree that this is more like OpenBazaar Alpha 2. It is not a Beta no matter how much the devs say it is.  But properly versioning software went to hell with Google Chrome. What they called Google Chrome 1.0 was more like 0.1. If they had been honest, Chrome 5.0 would had been Chrome 1.0 and right now it will just be at 7.0 or 7.5.

Yes, yes it was:
DarkMarket &amp; the next generation of uncensored trade
What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. The early attempts at shutting down centralised file sharing services ended up spawning stronger technology. Like a hydra, those of us in the community that push for individual empowerment are in an arms race to equip the people with the tools needed for the next generation of digital black markets.
Today we will show you the next generation of such software: opensource, uncensored and private. The next generation of resilient uncensored markets. The social implications of this breakthrough raise bigger questions about the role of technology, and efforts under way to carve out spaces of the future where we can survive, and thrive as freedom loving people.
Technology is power, and a new front has opened in the struggle for freedom. These tools are for resource management, digital governance and new finance. Technology is not, and never will be neutral. Software is art.

Easy answer is: Be the first to do a well done Bitcoin Wallet as a Windows Universal App for WP8.1/W8.1 and that later can easily upgrade to Windows 10. That code at the same you can reuse to do a Windows Desktop Wallet. But on the other hand that is not really needed. If you do a WUA Bitcoin Wallet, I will personally help you promote it. I am admin of The G+ Bitcoin Community (12500 members) and The FB Bitcoin Group (14500+) so, I do know I can give it exposure.

Shorting bitcoin explains the price pressure to not go up. But it does not entirely explains it being in a slow depression for a whole quarter now. But i get what are you are saying and of course that is also a big factor. In a sense so it is the whole capital flight Bitcoin has experienced going to altcois or metacoins in Bitcoin.  But the only constant vicious circle continues to be sell pressure from non-holding transactions + hashrate explosive rise squeezing Miners to sell = price downwards over a long period of time.  One of the solutions is Bitcoin getting as easy and fast to purchase with a constant reliability as it is to spend it. Since spending is also not holding and that is bad for the price.  Saludos Vic.

Heh, The top comment and one reply to that comment on the thread of the Bitcoin removal is me in my other reddit account. Looking back on it, it is cool to see I was totally right:
1.- Flattr has not got their service fully running on the new system yet. And they are slowly fading away.
2.-ChangeTip did grew to G+ and even YouTube and Tumblr. They have added their first badges, a widget and even Bitcoin Tip Profiles.  I do personally tested and gave feedback on all of that, though. 
3.-Patreon has already pretty much eaten Flattr lunch on the support by subscription model.

A truly Decentralized Social Messaging Network already exists. It is Twister. And it is like a mix of Twitter and Telegram in a way. I have been using it for a month now and while it is still many months from being fully developed. You can use it and it works well. Also easier to run than OpenBazaar. And it now has Windows and OSX builds (twisterd.net). If you check it out. Add me as AvatarX. And no, I do not have anything to do with it. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 07:38:51
I cannot resist replying since my answer is relevant to the OP. 
is still the biggest and most abuzz Bitcoin discussion destination that anyone can easily navigate. 
But it is not the only game in town. There is The G+ Bitcoin Community (12000+ members) and The Facebook Bitcoin Group (14000+).  Am an Owner and Admin in one and an Admin in the later, so I am biased. But just saying.
On moderating Not impossible. But it would need to be an actual day-to-day job for someone to do it effectively.  Yet people expect BashCo and ThePiachu to be miracle workers.
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:50:36
If you mean other than here then there is of course BitcoinTalk, even if it a bit of a maze. And if you want something eaiser to navigate and you are more interested in a community or group aspect. Then you can check out The G+ Bitcoin Community or The Facebook Bitcoin Group. They are respectively the Top ones in their respective network. I am biased on them since I manage the G+ community and am an Admin on the FB group.

All this said. I am also aware that the way Theymos is has to do somewhat with how young he actually is.
@_date: 2014-11-16 00:08:24
In the end Theymos is custodian of the money since it was donated. That is it. 
What I have never agreed about Theymos is him being so opaque considering he is the most important Bitcoin Community Manager given the power and reach he has.  But that is a personal gripe.
Another thing I disagree amongst many Bitcoiners is he going on a fools errand for more Bulletin Board styled forum software. As if the world had not had enough of that already. If that is the goal he should had just either gone with Discourse's code  or forked Discourse's Code to make his desired changes. Not, whatever he is going with. I mean, even Amir Taaki and the unsystem guys went with Discourse.  
Finally, while Theymos can do whatever he wants. I actually wish he would had instead donated to worthy projects like DarkWallet, OpenBazaar and even Lighthouse. 
One final point on why people are mad with Theymos is that for example the entire initial development of any of the worthy and very important projects I mentioned will be less than 1 million dollars each. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:34:11
Ok, I appreciate very much the direct reply. And while it may seem I have been harsh over at G+ and Facebook. It is simply because of OpenBazaar being one of the most important Bitcoin projects all around. I was the same way with the Trezor guys until they actually started shipping.  I am very much looking forward to see if the third release will be stable enough and to the ModernUI-like revamp for the fourth release. By then, i am sure I will be able to start using it regularly.

The current solutions for mining decentralization are p2pool + mining pool transparency. Yet there is no much movements of them to be publicly transparent and p2pool mining is still less than 3% of the hashrate. Only relief is that we no longer have a huge mining pool.

Ah, great news Victoria.  ChangeTip could not have got anyone better for the job. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:00:34
I think that it is pretty good. I do a transfer from time to time via the most trusted BTC2Paypal provider when I feel forced to do so and once you factor in Paypal's cut and the USD-MXN exchange rate, you end paying anywhere 9-10% and it still takes 3-5 days to clear. The cheapestroute is always LocalBitcoins in Person as you pretty much can get out on top with 1%+ or LocalBitcoins Online and you can still get out with a spread as low as -1% only that you need to put in the work required and it will take you most of a day to get it right and see all is well.
@_date: 2014-12-06 06:32:21

Umm, after krypto_jeff comment something came back to mind: 2013 story about someone claiming to have met satoshi in a meetup. The story varied on the year this happened, stated it had happened in California and then it varied on the context of the meetup been a hackerspace meetup or a bitcoin meetup.  Maybe until BvN retold it was been badly retold as BvN is very specific in the year, the place and the context.

And no BVN said a friend of his met this guy with the handle, not him directly.

Oh, I am very aware of that. That is why I am saying it would be even harder to do a tipping service that worked everywhere where the transactions are on-blockchain and for it to challenge ChangeTip. All while it being decentralized so people trust it. Am sure it is possible and I hope we see someone figuring it out.  Just that I am not holding my breath on it appearing soon.

After reading the ED entry on him + the Reddit post that first exposed him yesterday. There is a high chance of him being that guy too. My guess on why he has been able to escape justice? He always seems to go for scamming on niches within niches. Scam EXTREMELY quick (1-3 months) and the fact he did most of his scams online. Now he is getting caught because Dogecoin got so big, so fast he could not get out when he otherwise -based on his story- normally would had. Money and Attention was too good for him to quit it fast this time around. I hope they finally get him.

The only person that could take over BitcoinTalk from Theymos if he wanted to move on would be Sirius. But then he would have to manage the forum himself or put someone he could trust with it. Something that he obviously don't wants or is interested to do.  When it comes to it is good to remember Theymos is no longer the only Top Admin. ThePiachu also got full rights just in case. Can we now go back to discussing the block size? Which by the way I insist the first jump should be conservative. An Increase to 4mb would be great and it would be great if it was implemented before 2015 ends.

No, it won't. Hulu also has a movie trailers section. Epix has a 30-60 days exclusivity as it bought the rights to it. After that? Probably Netflix will have it first. But then Hulu Plus and Amazon may also get it. Unless they decide on another exclusive 30 days on iTunes. That is how the business of selling Documentaries or Indie Movies to online streaming sites works nowadays. For those that don't know what Epix is. It is a copy of Hulu focused on movies by Viacom, Lion Gate and MGM. It most ends up as a place on where those studios put their movies apart from the MGM basic cable channel.

I wrote this over at the G+ Bitcoin Community but I will paste it here too:
Imagining A ChangeTip Competitor
I am not against a ChangeTip alternative. However it is very precipitated to say ChangeTip cannot scale to be a profitable company. The reason being that since their transactions are off-blockchain. They cost nothing to do.
Then there is the fact there are still ways they can expand:
1.- Blog Comments Systems,
2.- A Site/Blog/Project directory a la Flattr
3.- A competitor to something like Patreon
4.- Something else I have not thought about.
If there is going to be a competitor to changetip that is "pure", then you need to do it as a decentralized p2p app that connects to nodes a la electrum and then the transactions need to be on-blockchain.
The downsizes to doing it that way are
- That the tipper needs to run the app,
- Whoever you tip needs to have a Bitcoin wallet already,
- Tips cannot be smaller than 0.10 USD with the notion that 0.03 will go to miners fees
- Tips will take 30-90mins to fully clear.
Having said that. It would be interesting if someone can make that work. But it would not be easy to do as then the process friction is a lot higher than it is with something like ChangeTip and you need to built up a brand from the ground up and have it accepted and recognized as much as ChangeTip.

woah, I had not seen this interview. great find and that story about a hacker with Satoshi Nakamoto as his handle at a 2005 Netherlands conference is an AMAZING fact find if true.  And it is a given that SN had to be aware of e-Gold, Liberty Dollar, Flooz, Beenz, Digicash and Liberty Reserve. Why? Because even I was aware of those around the time each of them came out. What is interesting is that I didn't knew about b-money or bitgold at all. Just like satoshi didn't until pointed to them which I found amusing back in late 2009 which is when I first knew of Bitcoin. Now, At this point I am less convinced that szabo is Satoshi. What I am convinced is that he sort of likes the ambiguity his works creates in making him the best candidate to be Satoshi. And this maybe so because of whatever his own correspondence with SN was like or says. Because what I find unlikely is that Satoshi didn't had a correspondence with szabo.

Understandably complicated. But yet another case where Lightning networks would be better suited to fix the problem. 
Could still work. So, the only thing stored is a balance of IOU's that is executed over a determined threshold and periodicity? Just to simplify. The problem would be that intent to tip does not represent final tip. So, would everything be private or things would be public in if people saying they would tip actually tipped or didn't tipped?

Decided to post this to The G+ Bitcoin Community and expand on my comment there: 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:10:54
Oh yeah. Let me give you examples of what were the 3 lines of electronic/digital/virtual currency races:
Electronic: Back in the late 80's and early 90's there was still the naiveté to try to do electronic currencies. I remember reading about HyperCard based currency files. Then there was tries for chip based currency cards. Similar to the PS1 memory cards. Obviously that such thinking was horribly flawed. You can see examples of that thinking in 70's-80's science fiction all around. This kind of idea was completely left behind in the 20th century.
Digital Currencies: Flooz, Beenz, Digicash, Bitcent, e-gold, Liberty Dollar, bit-gold, bmoney and then Bitcoin.
Virtual currencies: WoW Gold, ISK and of course the Linden Dollar. 
Now you tell me if Bitcoin or something like it was not an inevitable result. The magic of Bitcoin was doing a leap from any Digital Currency before by having a decentralized design and having the incentives aligned to it being decentralized. 
@_date: 2015-05-26 21:52:04
I know. Just that the immediate audience for it is the internet savvy and the Bitcoin Community.

Yeah, it would need to be public. And the tipbot would need to post when someone either fully tips in the end or don't tips in the end. Otherwise it would be shallow signaling of tipping without any accountability of the tips actually happening.

Since I have not really seen it done yet. I think you could do an extension app wallet for tipping websites/people that do have Bitcoin Addresses somewhere in their pages.
The difference would be that that extension would do it in two modes:
1) Tipping directly 0.50 USD (45c for the recipient and 5 for miner fee)
2.- Saving up addresses and then paying out every determined time dividing up whatever amount is in the wallet among all recipients saved up to that point. With the only rule being that each cannot get anything lower than 0.25 USD. 
Basically an extension that is both like flattr and changetip but that you can run yourself and with On-Blockchain transactions. You could call it Tapper or Tappr.

It is easier than ever if you are buying less than $500 USD. Once you pass than mark it becomes harder and slower. Buying $1K needs to be as easy and fast buying $100USD. That is not the case worldwide. You can spend $1K USD in BTC within 1 to 2 minutes anywhere in the world. Buying $1K  USD in Bitcoin depending where you are and where do you buy will take you from 1 hour to 5 days. That is a horrible divide compared to the time it takes to spend it.

Virtual Currency has an usage precedent and conventions inside controlled interactive environments. Perfect examples of Virtual Currencies are Eve-O's ISK and WoW's Gold as they got specific issuance and capital controls within their game universe. Even if their usage spills over outside of the control of the game companies that produce it. The reason of the conflict on the usage is thanks to the Linden Dollar from Second Life that while still a Virtual Currency, because of how it is modeled, many took that for some reason as similar to Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a Digital Currency because it primarily needs to be moved within an online network and it was created within the context of an information network design. But it is not tied specifically to any system for you to exchange value for it. In fact you can even exchange it offline. And in the extreme usage of Bitcoin. The transacting of Bitcoin can even be done mostly analogously via Radio Waves, Infrared Info Beam Networks or punch card operated telegraphic terminals if you really want to.

I am going to guess that Greg Maxwell is not impressed because in the end, high bandwidth usage has always been something fixable. Before, it required you to be very proactive about it. You needed to limit max number of connections and/or network shape the connection for your full node. 
0.12.0 introduced limiting data upload. And this can bring a full-node from using 300gb of bandwidth to 30gb or less if wanted. You now only really need to react and do the change, which is easy.

No, no, it cannot if you want to run a full node long term. Best bet is a HP Stream 7 or a Winbook TW700. It will cost you $150 USD with a 64gb msd/128gb usb drive + S&amp;H. Cost of doing the same on a Raspberry pi  2 when you include everything needed is actually $75-$100 depending where you live.

You bought both, prefer one of them for a personal reason. Reason you only decided on after buying both. Since you own and have used both, I am just surprised you don't have understood the stance and angle of each product. Trezor aims to be Multi-purpose because it has so as a vision and drive from day one since they initiated the space.  Keepkey choose simplicity, ease and feel first. Because it is a differentiator and because it was the smart play for them since they released a product in a space that was started by the Trezor. 
Now, on your point about the passphrase support. That is something only can answer.

*Here it is my translation. Normally I would not waste my time translating this kind of thing. But this Anti-Bitcoin propaganda is shockingly delusional and so painted by the numbers I thought I should. I also made an effort to conserve the tone of how it read back in Spanish.*
**BitCoin: The Cyber-Criminal System**
It is a causality that the criminal groups and terrorists of the world are the main activists and defenders of Bitcoin? / This digital currency is not backed by any institution or country. It is also used to pay for illegal transactions.
**Caracas, March 16 of 2016.-**  Some communications channels, technology experts and "knowledgeable" economists in the past few years have come out to defend Bitcoin, pushing aside all the risks concerning to it. This not only illegal, but also preferred system by cybercriminals.  Which facilitates transactions that come from criminal groups and terrorists, which affect the peace, the political fabric and economic stability of many countries in the world.
**What is Bitcoin?**
Bitcoin is a digital currency created by a group hiding behind the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto", and it is produced in base to complex mathematical algorithms. It is also not backed by any institution or country. And its use is limited to do transactions using the internet.  
**The Deep Web and Bitcoin**
The internet is formed by two kinds of website layers.  The Surfacing Web which is what we access via Google or other search engine and The "Deep Web".
The Deep Web is that part of the internet that contains information and websites that are not indexed in any of the existent search engines like Bing, Google, Yahoo, among others.
Once we enter this dark side of the internet, we find ourselves with a series of content tightly linked to scenes that are at the margin of legality: Drug sales, pornography, hitmen, piracy (books, music, movies),  fire arms and drugs marketplaces, among other things.
Curiously, in order to finalize these kind of purchases or hiring some of the illegal services, the currency to use is Bitcoin.
It is a coincidence that criminal groups and terrorists of the world are the main activists and defenders of Bitcoin?
One of the main characteristics of this digital currency is that you cannot track it, so the transactions are anonymous, which is of the total liking of those not wanting to leave out any tracks.  Putting this in other words, this could be the ideal currency of "the dark side of the internet", a kind of tax haven for drug dealers, rapists or any criminal element.
**Bitcoin in Venezuela:  A tool to evade taxes, launder money and damage the economy of the country.**
In Venezuela, there are groups dedicated to promote the use of Bitcoin, who don't doubt in qualify the use of this digital currency as having a subversive air to it.
For Venezuelans, it is not a secret the damage that it has caused to the economy that is it is being pushed and promoted via websites like Dollar Today. That it has got an illegal and criminal exchange rate that has caused a severe damage to the national economy, causing induced levels of inflation, which don't match to normal paramenters of economic development.
Recently it could be known that many people have started to use Bitcoin as an alternative to evade the currency exchange policies emitted by the Bolivarian government to guarantee a correct development of the economy .
Who regulates this currency? How does it fluctuate? Are questions that have found no answers.  What it is clear is that its use produces a negative effect to the national currency, to the use of legal commodities and to the productive growth of the economy.

The last time they assured it was going to come out was 6 months ago. 
Karl Gray and Austin Craig are members of The Facebook Bitcoin Group which I co-manage. Last time I saw them active was like 4 months ago. 
I honestly think that the worse mistake was to not try to quickly launch it and sell the rights. Which is exactly what The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin did and they got a more than OK success.  They sold the movie directly, they sold the rights for "premium" content network distribution which usually means hotels and airlines. And they now have sold the rights to Hulu. 
I cannot think of a better way to do things for what the window of opportunity for the movie was.  Life On Bitcoin guys just waited forever to release a movie with an even smaller window of opportunity.
Specially because of what they did got done by someone in The Bitcoin Show a long long time ago. Like 6 months or more before they did it. Then Kashmir Hill did something similar and then Sovereign Bitcoin did the same after them. Then the Bitcoin World Tour Guy did the same thing internationally.
At this point they should just sell the movie and the rights for cheap and be done with it. However, I do imagine that the reason it was not a big deal it didn't got released is because in the end it was Karl Gray call.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 introduced the ability to limit data uploading. If used, then a Full-Node can go from 300gb of bandwidth a month to 30gb. Which is what I would say is the right amount. But anything from 30gb to 90gb is very healthy. Previously, the 2 ways to reduce bandwidth usage was to limit connections or/and to network shape the connection of your full-node. 
Meaning: High Bandwidth Usage when running a Bitcoin Full Node has always been a problem the user could fix if wanted or needed. Before 0.12.0, it was a serious problem that required someone to be seriously proactive about it. Now it is an available option that only requires being reactive.  
Maybe this new option has been lost in the noise of all those saying that the sky is falling.

The removal happened around the same time. I asked around and someone told me that they had got some inquires about their service being able to be purchased anonymously. What do you think they could have possibly be talking about?
Usage of Bitcoin on Fiverr was low but enough for it to be left around given how they had set it up. The only way they would had got 10x+ more Bitcoin Usage would had been if they allowed to be paid in Bitcoin too. But given that would had meant having 1 person dedicated to Bitcoin in Fiverr side and would had brought a lot more scrutiny at the time they first adopted Bitcoin. It is not a surprise they didn't went with it. 
The only thing I am saying here is that from what I gathered, it is just too much of a coincide they removed it right around the same time the PDP thing was still raging on. I am also saying Fiverr didn't mattered much for Bitcoin adoption anyway as they didn't fully adopt it. 
But for what is worth I do have used fiverr a dozen times or so. From the time it launched to now. So, it is not like I am not familiar with it.

Some of the factors are that there is really not easy to access things to invest you don't have to deal with a lot of paperwork or ties that bind here. You only really can buy gold and now Bitcoin that meet that criteria. And in some cases if you are heavily touristic locations, you also hold USD as it is better than holding MXN AND you can accept it or buy it at a cut. But sell it at regular exchange rates.

Just a reminder: Segwit adoption would already be over 70% if bc(.)com and bitpay had added Segwit support in 2018.  It is late march of  2019 and they have yet to add it. Mycelium took a long time to add it. But to their credit they delivered.  When it comes to bc(.)com and bitpay not even a peep about it. I mean even BitGo now has segwit support. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:36:15
When I said otherwise? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:53:32
I would still argue that it had to do with the tons of bad attention Fiverr got over the PewDiePie scandal. They coincidentally removed Bitcoin Support just after that happened? Riiight. Just after they had received enquires about how it was possible people could anonymously pay people to do questionable things?  I honestly doubt it. But in the end Fiverr only ever adopted Bitcoin half way. Even if it was one of the sites that would had benefited from adopting it fully as that would had brought a ton more attention from the Bitcoin Community. But it is clear they didn't really wanted that. They just wanted the initial PR Boost from back when they added partial support for it.

USA has several services, but they keep changing around and rebranding so I am now not even sure of the actual domains for them. 
It is indeed surprising to see that Canada and Mexico now got more and better services for you to pay most of your bills with Bitcoin if you want. Or maybe USA has more, but if I am not sure which ones those are now. I doubt the average Bitcoiner would know. Even if from USA.
However, one of the services USA has I would like to see here in Mexico is something like Bitwage.  Same for something like Argentina's BitPagos.

For that, bcash would need to be more profitable to mine and that is still not the case at all. And for it to be worth it. bcash would need to be considerably more profitable which is unlikely to happen. And then, what is funny is that they would need to sell the mined bcash for bitcoin in most cases. And that alone also would make it more unlikely that bcash becomes considerably more profitable to mine than Bitcoin.

Sad to read. But not that surprising considering they didn't monetized from the start and they didn't even showed offers on their site or ran ads in there.  
But also very important is they did received quite a blow by Google, even if not intentional. When Google decided to break the full link comments in Blogger Blogs and YouTube Comments had when fully powered by Google+. ChangeTip then stopped working in Blogger blogs, YouTube, Google+ profiles and Google+ Communities.  The only way it would then work was if both the tip sender and the recipient followed ChangeTip. The same for Communities apart from ChangeTip having to be a member in that community. So, it more less never worked from that point on. 
It also could never fully work in Facebook either like it got to work on the Google side at one point.
Without it being able to fully serve Facebook and Google sites. It just didn't had any possible chance to grow. 
But it was a great experiment to participate in and I thank ChangeTip for supporting The Google+ Bitcoin Community twice back in 2014.

There was one: Quickcoin. 
But just like with ChangeTip and other apps. When it came to the use of Bitcoin. It could only work if the people followed each other. 
The very best implementation of a Bitcoin Wallet in a Social Network was ChangeTip on Google+ until the point Google rearranged the backend and pretty much completely broke the way things worked. Which was quite cool since it worked between contacts, between strangers, publicly, privately, in posts,  in pages, in communities, in blogger comments and in YouTube comments. 
Once they rearranged the G+ backend.  It could only work if the people receiving and sending were mutually following each other and it only worked in posts within Google Plus.

That's something even Satoshi wanted to do but never got to do. The reason being it was not really possible to built it before having a need for it.  Then, since he didn't lingered along, It was then never built.  
It is my opinion that extra incentives should first be service based. 
Right now there is really only 2 of those kind of incentivized full-nodes. 
1.- Bitcore from Bitpay on which you can then run BWS, so you can run the backend for your Copay wallets. It just never caught up because it is Linux Only. But even if it was cross-platform. Its appeal potential would limited. However, whoever was that decided to make it Linux-only made a horrible call. 
2.- 21inc B-PC.  Which can only be acquired if you buy what is now very obsolete hardware at a crazy premium.  But even if it is now possible to set up your own instance of it for cheaper. It is still not easy to do. Meaning it has limited appeal.
As an extra. People now have forgot about it. But BitcoinXT launched twice. The first time it appeared, it did so with the main goal of being what powered Lighthouse. The crowdfunding platform that Mike Hearn had raised money for and then just let die while at the same time pivoting BitcoinXT to be about pushing for a contentious fork. The original  BitcoinXT was not a bad idea. But, well, we know how things turned out. 
Having thought about this for now several years.  The only solution would be for Bitcoin Core to be able to work a lot better with Add-on modules. If that were possible. That could do change the game. You could have a 21inc B-PC module, a Copay BWS module and other use case modules using a full-node instance as backend. 1 at a time or maybe even multiple ones at a time. 
I think that would give more incentives to run full-nodes.  Personally, I do believe that it is something that needs to be considered as we move to a future when there will be 2 or 3 classes of Bitcoin Nodes. 
Would like to know what thinks of this problem.

Because, I have asked about it to several Googlers that used to work on G+.  What they did was break the context the G+ powered backend had in YouTube comments and Blogger Comments with G+ itself. Which broke a lot of traffic sharing in a quite dumb way for barely any reason.  It also broke ChangeTip on anything Google among other apps.  They pretty much cannot shut down G+ without having to replace or also kill pages, communities and collections. They would also need to retool blogger comments. They may still do it. But there will be ample warning. And considering how long other stuff was left alive just wihout changes for 5 years or more like Google Profiles or Google Groups, etc.  For Google, G+ is simply Google Profiles now and what allows for user interaction in Pages, Collections and Communities. That's why I say it.

Well, I just remember his way way back original goal was to supposedly eventually power lighthouse with BitcoinXT. Similar to the Bitcore+BWS example. He never even ended getting anywhere close to doing that of course. Just pointing out that, supposedly, that was the idea. 
On your point of being a bad idea overall from an engineering perspective. Yeah, I get that point. And time proved you right. 
The only things that were successful were the crowdfunding campaigns he did. Nothing else was because if you remember, Lighhouse had no search built in and later even stated there was not plan for the feature to ever exist, even if it meant users had to add it after the fact.  But he had a list of dozens of features he wanted to add. 
On the last point. I would argue that more than anything. The process of integrating external applications would need to be streamlined with documentation, examples and maybe even Bitcoin Core maintaining a list of notable external apps that can be used. But, do realize that, it don't means would be something Bitcoin Core would want to do or could do given the time cost supporting that in a more visible way would mean.

In Google+ everything is a stream of medium blog-like posts where Public, private and reserved (group) conversations/sharing also happen as posts or streams of posts and not messages. Pages, communities and collections posts can also be accessed from the profile stream of the user that created the post and have that post also be pushed to that user followers. You decide where posts are seen, how they are seen and who sees it quite easily.  Things are also very easy to manage contextually. 
Basically, Google+ has more in common with the Social Messaging Network model of things like Friendfeed, Pownce and Rejaw. If you never used any of those. You may still not fully get why Google+ is unique. However, that uniqueness is also what hurt the first version of Google+ as most people had also never used those sites. Google itself didn't did it any favor with the horrible way they promoted it and forced it onto people without even explaining it or it been fully finished.

Because in these cases paypal will usually end up being the one on the hook for the money. The scammer probably converted from paypal to another payment service so paypal cannot get the money back.

The only simple solution is to network shape the connection the full node is running on. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 22:29:55
Because the differences in price and size are still significant enough for it to be worth to do it on a PI. But the best way to do now it is no doubt going with the best available in that specific hardware. So your full node can last the longest possible.

There were 2 things I didn't like about the documentary:
1.- That it was released without a direct option where there was a direct download  for Bitcoin at a lower price than vimeo vod. Lets say $4.99 USD.  TheProtocol.tv version didn't worked right for many.
2.- Zhou Tong being in it is an odd choice. 
Other than that, it was a good watch. I watched it when it came out because someone sent me their vimeo link. Otherwise I would not have bothered. I did took down a previous YouTube version over at The G+ Bitcoin Community back then. And that unlisted version had like 1000 views at that time, so, while that may frustrate the movie makers. I think that more people has probably watched it over YouTube already than from Vimeo and TheProtocol.tv put together. It happened  with The rise and rise of Bitcoin. So, it happening again should not be a surprise.

@_date: 2015-08-26 08:36:20
Yes. It can go as low as 2/2. Before 1.0, Copay also had a web version meant for Full-OSes. They must have removed it because going forward it would had meant for them to hold a key, so it could be accessed via any mobile browser on any kind of circumstance. But it would had worked like you imagine as in being able to use a multi-sig wallet from a single device without any hoops.  It is still possible and I do have tested it myself. The way to it is to remote to another os to authorize a transaction.  The other possible way is obviously dependent on if you carry a second smartphone or a tablet with you often.  But I would say that multi-sig is not meant for spending wallets where you should not have more than $500 USD on it. A secured 1-sig copay wallet is ok for that. Personally, I use Copay with a 1-sig wallet + a 2/2-sig wallet. For a vault wallet, Hardware wallets are better. For a Cold Wallet? Something like Cryptosteel is the best. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 06:08:01
Umm. They must have hit a snag and they probably got cut off.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:15:13
It will not happen. 1000 Bitcoin ATM's in Greece would be 900 too many. And learning from what happened on 400 Bitcoin ATM to hit Dubai when in the end I only knew of 4 that were ultimately installed and openly available. So, maybe only 10 will actually get to be installed in Greece. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:36:05
It went down for them as BItcoin adoption went up, as they gained stronger competition from other bitcoin accepting startups, as their company grew and as they decided cut out most of the world from gyft. This last thing probably after they were bought. So, yeah.

There actually have been Bitcoin apps on Windows Phone for 2 and half years. Even right now, there are 5 that work with Bitcoin. And almost all Bitcoin Wallet sites work on IE11 and Edge. This said, Copay is now the best option.
@_date: 2015-08-20 07:09:20
The hardware quality, both internal and external seems top notch. Unfortunately, someone told me it could cost $150-199. Even if that factors in S&amp;H. This mean it cost 35% to 70% more than a Trezor (with S&amp;H included). That also potentially puts it midway between a Trezor and a Case Wallet.

How I hate that analogy. The reason is that iTunes has nothing to do with napster at all:
Social Networks: Friendster &gt; Myspace &gt; Facebook
p2p file sharing: Napster &gt; Emule &gt; Bittorrent
music stores: Musicmatch &gt; cdbaby &gt; iTunes
Virtual Currency: beenz &gt; flooz &gt; isk &gt;wow gold &gt; Linden Dollar
Digital Currency/ E-Money: digicash &gt; E-gold &gt; Liberty Dollar &gt; Bitcoin 
And the huge difference is that Bitcoin is the only thing of all I listed above that is fully decentralized, trustless and a protocol. 
It is sad when people not only don't know history or even what they are talking about, but they smash two things together as equal to each other without they being anything but. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 03:01:03

Well, considering what they have been releasing so far. It is actually good news they now admit it is better to release until it actually works and stays working.  The other upside is that we can do expect for the 1.0 release to actually fully work and get released for Windows simultaneously now that is not only users wanting it to work but also investors.

I like it a lot. I have it on Windows 10, Windows 8.1 U1 and in WP8.1 Denim.  It is the easiest way to set up a multi-sig wallet. And you can encrypt both the backup and the private key for use in the wallet. When you combine that with Multi-Sig, it is very secure. As secure as using a ledger wallet.  Then there is the fact you can create a super strong multi-sig, light multi-sig or even a single-sig wallet and have all 3 living in the same app for different uses. This makes using Bitcoin the easiest yet. For those that don't know where to keep the encrypted backup I would recommend putting it inside another encrypted environment. You could put it on MEGA and then also put it on encrypted email like Protonmail. There is a third even more secure option, but that would give away one of my ways to do things.  But those two should suffice for anyone.

Eh, it is not the only Bitcoin wallet. There were 2 for a long time that got removed by their developers. And there are right now other 4 apart from Copay. But since its 1.0.1 version release, Copay it is now indeed the best one.

One little inconsistency is that if I have set my preferred unit to BTC, then it should show me the custom fees in BTC fractions too and not in Bits. And while the custom fees are a great feature addition, I would still like to be able to set my own fee and custom transactions. Similar to how you can do it in Blockchain.info. That said, Copay is now my favorite Bitcoin Wallet. Specially because it is in Windows Phone too.

Copay got 4 very important things going for it:
1.- Very easy to use. Which is important when setting up wallets for new users.
2.- Available on ALL platforms. I use it on W10 and WP 8.1, someone else can use it on Ubuntu and UM or OSX and iOS. Hell, even on a Chromebook and Android. There is no other Bitcoin Wallet available that is on all platforms like that.
3.- Easiest way to set up multi-sig wallets.
4.- You can have multiple wallets with multiple degrees of security on the same app.

1 is a multi-cryptocurrency wallet, 2 are hosted and part of a service a la coinbase. And the other one is also native but for pay.  Copay is now no doubt the best one. On the ones that used to be, they were quite good. One was for Blockchain.info and the other was for both BC.info and Coinbase and integrated to the OS wallet hub. Still have them.

I miss Almost Human a whole lot. Too bad the reason why it didn't got renewed was because Fox Studios didn't owned the rights to it and didn't produced either.  It was done by Warner Bros.  
Second Chance is nothing but a consolation prize.  One they actually directly produced.  Also as a fun fact: The reason why that horrible Minority Report show got produced was because Almost Human didn't got renewed. Sad, right? 
But Fox is the worst place for good shows that don't get produced there or don't give exclusive rights to Fox. Proof of that was of course Firefly.

Minority Report worse crime is not only being a horribly done adaptation of something that should not had been tried to be adapted. It is the fact it is copying another quite mediocre and cheap show. Which is Sleepy Hollow.
But now you know the why of good shows in Fox not making it. If it didn't got renewed, it is because Fox Didn't owned exclusive rights to it or didn't produced it.

Eh, maybe. More likely 2017. 
But it should do happen eventually. In Mexico &amp; Latino America it already happened with MercadoPago which is like Paypal. You can now pay with Bitcoin in over 100 big sites that have integrated MercadoPago to their checkout.  I would even dare to say that the reason why Paypal got Wences Casares to their board was because they knew of MercadoPago broad expansion plans for 2016 and 2017 and because of AliPay saying they were considering expanding outside Alibaba and Aliexpress. 
Also, Rakuten seems to have plans on doing their own version of paypal for their international expansion. And it is worth to note they invested in Bitnet. 
Anyway, I bet this is why Paypal is now very concerned about future growth and maintaining dominance.

The problem with Mega is that while still relatively good. Premium version got quite expensive. Even if the streaming anything from your cloud storage is a nice feature to have.  The free version, is honestly now almost unusable at times because they give too little bandwidth for anything but small files.

I guess I should share that they tried to recruit me as a way to provide a marketing boost for BitClubNetwork via referrals. While at the same time refusing to clarify what exactly they wanted from me. Played along until all the excited circular talk was too much for me to take.

Actually, probably not. It probably would need to be either done in a similar way to counterparty which is a metacoin or as a sidechain token like what happens  in RSK and Liquid. Or even a mix of both things.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:39:43
Really odd question. But yes, in theory it could be done with a metacoin on top of Bitcoin. But making it work long term is another matter entirely.

I find the whole tension emote acting wave actors to be hard for people not familiar with it to be even able to qualify it. But it is obviously quite a big trend right now. Rami is probably a fine example of that wave along with Jennifer Lawrence.  Personally, I get why it is so big now considering the current societal conditions.  Just that I dislike the overuse of the technique or the technique being the whole toolbox in new actors which so far seems to be the case with Rami and Jennifer Lawrence. Eh, yet people seem to like it.

Would not work as a series. As an indie movie for Netflix? Sure. I would do like to You got E-mail to be remade for today. But who you would even put as actors in it? Honestly that is more of the problem for it to make it work. Unless you went the opposite direction and did a movie like it but with actors over 70. Then, it could do work.

I now think I understand what he wants to do. He wants to remake Megakey and reuse some of the ideas he had for megabox. Bitcache does not ties each file transfer with bitcoin transactions.  It must tie wallets to MU2 accounts with a root identifier that can then be used for user rewards programs, an affiliate program, revenue sharing, etc. And that via that root identifier, it can also tie files to an account. Hence, the only transaction that needs to be done to the Bitcoin Blockchain is with the creation of a MU2 account. 
At least that would be my guess given what he said.  Not a scaling solution at all, just the fact it would not carry big concern to The Bitcoin Blockchain.  however if he is going to do that, the worry and burden then also comes with secure key handling just like with Bitcoin Wallets.

Bitpay detects if you send the transaction in super economy or low fee ranges for Steam and will then wait for 1 confirmation, just that if the transaction don't confirms in less than 1 hour, it will be auto-cancelled. If you send on the normal to priority range, then your Steam purchase is instant. I have tested this. 
What Bitpay should do add is that if the transaction fails on steam side and it is confirmed as cancelled, then they should issue an automated return of the amount minus the fee of course. But I understand why they also would not want to do that.

Once again Nick Szabo avoided the question about if he ever had communication with Satoshi and what it was about. I believe he did had communication with Satoshi. It would be shocking if he didn't. But unless the email dump of Satoshi gmx account surfaces, we may never know since Nick obviously refuses to talk about that.

Full Nodes would fragment into 3 versions: 
1.- With a complete Blockchain from the genesis block.  
2.- With full Blockchain with only 12 months worth of all transaction data that gets auto-pruned + transactions headers all the way back to the genesis block.
3.- With full Blockchain with 1 month worth of all transaction data that gets auto-pruned + transactions headers all the way back to the genesis block.
Simple. Just that those scenarios are not yet needed and will not be needed for another 3-4 years.

This again? Ok, let me clarify things here for those that feel owed the money even if they never donated. The only way to sue Theymos is the following: 
Original forum donors living in USA would need to do a class action lawsuit. Which in order to do needs for them to identify themselves publicly and prove they controlled the wallets from where the money got donated from. Once that is achieved then they need to tally the total amount donated based on the fiat price it had when donated. Not what it has now. When doing the class action suit they can then also ask for punitive damage reparation in order for it to be worth it to sue Theymos.  
The problem then is that if they were to do that, then they also need to pay taxes on it. Once they also do that, now they are also in the spotlight from then on.
1= There will be never a class action lawsuit against Theymos. The reason being it would not produce those suing any riches at all. And it turns it would actually could become a hassle to them. 
2= Theymos can do whatever the hell he wants. He could even just pocket it and there would no way for anyone to do anything about it because he is not a registered charity or non-profit organization of any kind. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 01:42:05
Other way around this is to ask for the bitcoins back and prove you donated. Then if theymos denies it you are also out of luck. But he could also just give out whatever amount it was equivalent when it was donated. 
In all honesty. It is probably what I would do. Return the amount of BTC equivalent to the BAEP at the time of donation for those that asked their donation back and could prove it.

Decentralization on something like that at scale is way harder to achieve.  We are probably not going to see something of such quality until 4 years from now. And that is being optimistic. 
Sync.com has been around for 4 years now, and also optimistically should be around 4 more in their current form. That is good enough for a Decentralized version to appear and evolve to the point it may be viable. 
In the meantime, Sync seems to be the very best option right now. Only thing they need to provide is proof of a code audit and for them to open source their code.  Beyond that, I think there is not much more they could do.

This is why nothing that tries to do a social network that don't depends on advertising has yet to work. No one collaborates with anyone. Diaspora has got a ton better. But it still only has like 2 Million people on it and its federating model will assure it will never see, lets say, 10 million users..  App.Net failed because Dalton Caldwell decided to turn his back on everyone instead of adjusting and soldiering on to see if things could be turned around. Never got to 500K users. Twister has not took off and only has 5K active users out of 100K people that tried it out. Right now the best bet seems to be Ello.co as it has already over 4M users and has been legally set up on around the same principles as TPO.com  I don't know how successful TPO.com will be. But can it beat Ello.co? Or even Diaspora? I think that answer should itself 1 year or 2 years from now. And it is likely it won't be able to beat Ello.co. Because when it comes to Social Networks, the main thing is it getting enough users to keep everyone engaged enough with it.

As someone who has tried to like freenet since it started. It is just too slow and too ugly for 2015 standards. I2P and retroshare are just better choices that dealing with freenet and that is why they have grown and improved a lot more than freenet while they got released years later.   ZeroNet has the advantage that it is really easy to use, it is fast, looks good and can be anonymized if you want it too. Then there is also ipfs,morph.is, Openbazaar and twister.

They charging higher is such crap as it undermines the point of accepting Bitcoin and the chance for it to get better traction. But since there is no accidental renewing with Bitcoin. They went for it since they figured it would still be able to generate some good PR and excuse themselves of having to answer if they accept Bitcoin. Higher price would be understandable in the monthly pricing, but in a yearly pricing is just insane. Something that should tell you they are just doing it for the publicity and to not having to say no to customers, even if the price is almost as if they were saying it.
@_date: 2015-09-23 19:13:39
It was not there when I first checked. Reason of my surprise here. I do like the free shipping. That evens out the price with Case and that makes things a lot better. I do like the design a lot too.

Yeah, it is really strange. Even I shared that mugshot picture wall it was done to promote abbybitcoin. I have now updated that post though. But there is something off/odd about her behavior in the video. What I believe happened was that she had no control over anything abbybitcoin related and that she didn't got to keep most of the money she made and ended up screwed out of money. Abbybitcoin twitter account was erased, but the site is still up. Then, after doing some searches, it does seem that abbybitcoin could had been created to enhance and string together several projects. Allowing for cross-promotion and a cheap way to raise the profile of such projects.  So, while it can be said abbybitcoin was a fake character.  I have not seen that the supposed work she did was fake. The whole thing is really odd. If you got any info or a way to check if the work she supposedly did was done or not. Then that would be one thing to look at, to further determine if there was scam element face out. As the only scam seems it may had been done to her.
**Update**: I read the reply. So, from her view, she feels scammed and cheated. From the FTB's guy it was more of a "Reality Bites" + "breakup scorn" thing. In the end it don't really matters if the photo work was real and people were not being scammed out of their bitcoins. However, in these kind of dramas, nobody wins or comes out clean once they get rolling on in the public eye. So, one can only believe half of each side.

When they did that, I thought that was a horrible idea. You need to be the cheapest, but still generate revenue. Of course that Bitpay was doing amazing up to that point and their arrogance got the best of them. But then you lose $1.8M USD in an amateur hour moment. And you end up having to fire people and saying goodbye to the Bitcoin Bowl and having to backtrack on price promises.  Sad, but understandable. I don't see the need to be so harsh on BitPay considering all they have done.  In their case they really only had one fuck up. Just that it happened to be a huge one.

It is a great question. One that I like to answer whenever it is asked in the sites I manage or co-manage because it is not answered enough.  
1.- Yes. Full Nodes secure the network by assuring stronger decentralization of the ledger archive keeping. And by being able to validate your transactions yourself.
2&amp;3.- Those running full-nodes should have more incentives to do so. Unfortunately it is of the things that were left unfinished and mostly even not started by Satoshi Nakamoto. At one point what namecoin does could had been tied to full nodes. The same goes for other things like Bitmessage and even to a point what 21 inc is attempting with their Markets API calls for their Bitcoin Computer. But it could still could go beyond that in some way with other things or versions of those same things, like having better handle of smart contract issuing, reading and tracking. Etc.  What happened is that these things spun into projects outside of Bitcoin Core because at the time it made sense given how new the project was and to reduce complexity.
But one of the very few good ideas Mike Hearn had with Bitcoin XT was adding additional functions for extra services to a full-node. In his case referring to lighthouse. So, the only real way to be able to add better and further incentives to running Full Nodes would be by adding modules that would allow it to provide extra services from which revenue in Bitcoin could be had. It is no accident than what 21 inc is trying to do is pretty much do their own version of a full node which apart from connecting to the Bitcoin Network, it connects to the 21 inc cloud.
Now, on why that was not done by Satoshi? I think that as soon as the Assange Mention happened, he got too nervous to continue working in Bitcoin. Then there was the fact that he got surprised by how fast Mining evolved and by how fast the concept of Pooled Mined appeared, which was what separated Mining from Bitcoin Core from then on. Then once Gavin told him about the infamous meeting. Satoshi preferred to just go away.

That's a weird claim Chris. I mean, I don't have anything to do with LTB. But I would not claim that as I don't see any evidence of that. I think they have the views/listens they have since it has been around for so long that it just has a big enough audience at this point. If they were buying views/listens, then they are doing a bad job at it as numbers would need to be a lot better for it to be worth it.  When it comes to the forum, it is all because of the tired format and because forums, communities and groups just don't grow unless whoever is managing them participates and promotes them all around. And I speak out of experience.
Or, again, they have been around forever and have build enough of an userbase/audience. Case in point the crazy numbers BitcoinTalk still has.

Correct. Even in cash heavy economies. The money flowing or being held in actual bills is not more than 25%. Meaning 75% is digital at all times now. In the case of Mexico according to last reports now only 20% of the money in the Mexican economy is cash. Elsewhere is usually 10% to 15% tops. So, 75% to 90% of all money in lets say, the top 50 countries is actually just digital money. Bitcoin instead, as a currency is not just Digital Money, it is also always Digital Cash. That's the big differentiator and easiest way to explain what is the difference between Fiat Currencies and Bitcoin.

The simplest way is to tell him why not he withdraws some onecoins to trade for Bitcoin or why don't he tries to spend some onecoins in something. 
Then, just tell him to ask himself why if it is not scam, onecoin is not listed in coincap.io or why there is not a site like blockchain.info for it. 
If you do both of these things and it don't clicks in his mind he has been scammed. Then there is really nothing you can do but to tell him "I told you so" once he loses his shirt.

The article reads out exactly like many articles from back in 2011. It is pretty obvious that he just heard about Bitcoin recently. It is also quite amusing he actually believes that the Jamaican Government would be able to enforce regulation on something that is mostly internet based.  EVEN if it were the case they would want to regulate against it which is doubtful. But more importantly, it is a country where knowledge in forex is a common and basic skill because its economy largely depends on Tourism. Trying to ban a worldwide currency in a country with that cultural context would only make it more desirable.

It is not as anomalous as that may seem. However, it would do be sad if Adam has gone with doing that. I guess I prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt.

If you agreed to the ZCL is because you saw the ZCL prompt which means your wallet supports ZCL. If so, then you already released the funds that matches that transaction and your wallet is locked out of initiating new transactions until that transaction you agreed gets to 1 confirmation or the determined time for your lock passes. You would not be able to get out of it. And you using another wallet after means you are using other funds from another address and you are initiating another completely separate and new transaction.

Nothing can prevent people from going out with the full intent of committing fraud and being jerks. Because that is what you are talking about. 
ZCL would still work for everyone not going out of their way with the intention to do that. Which would be 99%+ of users. Specially since cheating ZCL successfully only would work on in-person transactions. 
And in the end ZCL is just what I thought to be the easiest and best way to mitigate a problem that people seem to think RBF introduces. Even if the problem has always existed.

And while many talk about an alternative. There is not one that has all that Blockchain.info does in a single place. The closest to it as a wallet is greenaddress which comes with its own set of problems and only really works as it should on Chrome.  Then there is just going low-end with Rushwallet or high-end with BitGo. Or turn back on you being the holder and join Coinbase or Circle and that is something I would not recommend. Coinbase has been horribly invasive for over a year as they turned into Big Bitcoin Brother as I had said it would happen and it is not going to get better.  For my part when it comes to hot wallets I am using the new blockchain.info wallet and copay.

I do however think there could be a solution for wallets and payment processors to the double spend perceived risk introduced by RBF. It would simply allow a 10 to 30 minute transacting software lock depending on the fee, to be agreed on the customer side at the time of transaction. Here is how I think it could work and I would call it ZCL. As in Zero Confirmation Lock.
- Customer initiates transaction with a merchant somewhere.
- Merchant sees payment in-transit confirmation in Yellow. A ZCL button appears and the merchant clicks it.
- Customer receives a request prompting for authorization for the ZCL to happen. 
- Customer clicks it.
- Merchant receives a second green notification that says ZCL has been approved. 
= Everyone is happy. Everything is fine.
Optionally the ZCL feature could just not happen at all if the transaction has a priority fee. Or/And if the transaction value is lower than lets say $9.99 USD.
Finally a warning on an incoming no-fee transaction in red would also need to happen on both sides. Which is something that can now be solved because of RBF. Even if it something that would only happen in the first place if the wallet has the option to input or not your own fee. Which is now either a rare option or an advanced and not default option.

In my opinion Blockchain.info HD is quite good. However, I do agree with many that they completely fucked up by not providing a warning to users that it was a horrible idea to port their regular wallet to the HD version. I also don't know why it took so long for the HD version to be offered. I had it for almost 6 months before it debuted. ~~It is still not offered as default.~~  ~~My guess is that it is because all their monetization and deals are tied to the regular version somehow.~~
I no longer recommend it unless who asks wants their Bitcoin wallet to have a web version. ~~But then it is annoying I have to tell them to make sure to go for the HD version and not the regular version.~~ 
Having said all this. I do know they are still doing fine. There is also no way to deny how important Blockchain.info has been for Bitcoin Adoption at the same time they give you the choice to preserve your privacy.  Shame for those who do that now. Even daring to compare them to Coinbase is insulting. 
It really is just very unfortunate that they cannot find a way to finish revamping themselves and have the HD version as the only version. I do wish they can turn the tide and be a lot better in the near future. 
I just saw that the HD version is now the default one for new users.

The wallet app would not let you initiate a new payment/transaction until 1 confirmation has been reached on the previous transaction. Lock time would be determined the fee used in the transaction. Based on current fee structure as determined in many wallets this how long Lock Time would need to last. 
- Priority = 10 minutes max 
- Standard/Normal = 20 minutes max.
- Economy = = 30 minutes max.

And just to make up a point. The final cost for trying to run a full node with one of these would actually be at least $50 USD including S&amp;H. But depending where you are the cost can go up to $70 USD. Since you need to add a usb mini-hub, a 128gb micro sd card that I don't know if it can actually support or a 128gb USB Drive and a Wifi dongle. 
In resume, you would be crazy to actually try running a full node out of this thing. I am not saying it is impossible. Just that it will be unreliable and that I doubt such a thing would be able to last even 6 months.

I mean, it is very simple. Given how he managed to convince so many people with so little proof. He could have just done a big spectacle of it. Doing a transaction with a message using minted and unmoved 2009 dated coins would had been a completely inconclusive but very conclusively spectacular way of doing it.

Only really missing is GOG.com. That would be more than enough for PC gaming and then there would not even be a rush for Valve. As Steam games could still be bought for Bitcoin on HB, GMG, G2A and Kinguin while waiting for them. Also GOG accepting it would make the most difference as it is probably the only competitor Steam cares enough to actually feel the need to adopt Bitcoin themselves.

@_date: 2015-03-18 16:49:53
Ok, Since asked.  Here is the truth on what is going in Mexico in terms of Bitcoin right now:
Not that much in terms of actual adoption and that is why Banco de Mexico and Hacienda don't care. But yeah we do now have more than enough exchanges and money transfer services. From Altis/Unisend that is Jose's companies. To mexbt, volabit, sendbitcoin.mx, pademobile, Bitcoin42 and tuminium. And then there is also Localbitcoins.
What is needed is payment processor support as there is none. 
In general I don't expect Bitcoin in Mexico to suddenly explode here as it has been growing incredibly slow the past 2 years. Mexico City status on Bitcoin right now is like going back Los Angeles Status on Bitcoin back in early 2013. 
I also don't expect Banco de Mexico or Hacienda to do any serious Bitcoin comment this year, But maybe in early 2016.

free tutanota accounts are great for signing-up to stuff but not really for actual use. Protonmail 2-step encryption is a better approach and the interface is also a lot better.  It is also Open source and it can interoperate with other PGP solutions. Be it future products like one I am testing. Or stuff like PGP-enabled Facebook Messages if you want to. Or if Yahoo Mail does release their PGP-enabled option, Protonmail will be able to work with it right away.

I do have been thinking about that story. It does send me into a loop. But I also keep recollecting factoids about Craig Wright behavior and the more I do, the greater is the disconnect between a guy who went to great lengths to almost always write as if he was public persona while at the same time protecting his privacy with all the strength of his breath. 
Adding the story of The First Sighting Of Satoshi Nakamoto makes things even more confusing. One thing I do know for certain is that Craig Wright was super early into Bitcoin. Probably 1 of the very first 100 people to try it out and mine too.  He was in within the very first week. This is known since the guy was subscribed to all the right mailing lists and feeds. In the case of the right mailing list, he has been following them for over 20 years now.  Do I think there is a possibility he got ahold of who satoshi was? I do can believe that. But at this point we don't even know if he may had been the guy who hacked or may have paid for the dump of Satoshi email. Something that would give him all the insight he would need to impersonate and fool others about him being satoshi. 
For me the most troubling of all is the timing of all of this. Why now? How come nothing on this stuff broke out in 2013?, there must be several why's to that. If there is one thing that gavin is right about is that truth is always stranger than fiction.

I do however think there could be a solution for wallets and payment processors to the double spend perceived risk introduced by RBF. It would simply allow a 10 to 30 minute transacting software lock depending on the fee, to be agreed on the customer side at the time of transaction. Here is how I think it could work and I would call it ZCL. As in Zero Confirmation Lock.
- Customer initiates transaction with a merchant somewhere.
- Merchant sees payment in-transit confirmation in Yellow. A ZCL button appears and the merchant clicks it.
- Customer receives a request prompting for authorization for the ZCL to happen. 
- Customer clicks it.
- Merchant receives a second green notification that says ZCL has been approved. 
= Everyone is happy. Everything is fine.
Optionally the ZCL feature could just not happen at all if the transaction has a priority fee. Or/And if the transaction value is lower than lets say $9.99 USD.
Finally a warning on an incoming no-fee transaction in red would also need to happen on both sides. Which is something that can now be solved because of RBF. Even if it is something that would only happen in the first place if the wallet has the option to input or not your own fee. Which is now either a rare option or an advanced and not default option.

The release funds as they projects go model cannot be abused in the way you are thinking. It is controlled by who funded it, never by who is being funded. Those funding a project could still get socially engineered or manipulated to release funds in advance or if they are led to believe a goal was met even if it wasn't. But that is also whole other issue and it would be rarer as it requires a lot more effort from the scammer.
The fixed amount goal funds being released when met was indeed how Lighthouse worked. Also how BitcoinStarter works in their main model. That is indeed possible to abuse by self-funding. The same is true for regular crowdfunding platforms.
On if it do we really need this. I think we do. It is just that we have yet to see it being done correctly. Hearn abandoning Lighthouse didn't helped things either though.

GPD only releases a device line per year now. Supports it for a year. Then the device is still a Windows Device with its own support via the OS.  And also because it is specifically a Windows 10 device. It will get direct LinuxInWindows support in July 29 which is how Bash in Windows works and it comes with Canonical Suppport. And finally because it is a Budget Windows Device, you can also easily install other OSes and multi-boot if you want. You can put Linux Mint along side it. Or RemixOS, or whatever you want. 
The Pyra PC is going to ship with outdated and HORRIBLE specs for $500 USD! Making it quite crappy. The GPD Win is going to ship with the very last and just released Atom X5 chip model. And they might even do an Atom X7 version which would give it specs on par with the Surface 3 best model.  All for $500 USD with S&amp;H included.
If you still think that the Pyra PC is somehow better. Well..good for you.

At first, it was the only charge it could be done by task/gig. Then it was just the initial charge. 
To give you an example, lets say you paid me $5 for a blog post of 300 words. But it would then be an extra $5 for length extension. Meaning a 1000 words blog post from me would cost you $20, but a 900 words blog post would only cost you $15.  But for the listing, it would say a blog post is just $5. Which would still be true. $15 would then either get you 3 regular blog posts or a regular length article. 
And that is how fiverr works. This news changes that completely going forward. Which is why I say that a Fiverr rebranding could do happen.

Ah yeah. Any previous failed install will make it impossible for it to start correctly afterwards if you don't clean the previous attempt. OpenBazaar has very bad Install/Uninstall hygiene on Windows. First make sure you fully remove all traces of OpenBazaar if you previously installed it. That means the folder itself and the folder that it is in AppData. 
Then clean your registry with ccleaner.
Then activate your firewall and put your UAC on highest. Both things you always should do anyway. 
Restart. 
Install the new version. Launch it, authorize it and at the time it ask for setup Windows Firewall will prompt you 1 or 2 times to grant it permissions. You grant them. 
Then, you should be able to start using it normally.

There is a reason why Fiverr has been growing faster than Upwork. And the reason is that Upwork sucks compared to Fiverr in the ease of use, UI and UX. I once tried Upwork and it sucked.

Anyone running BU is not right in their frame of mind to begin with if they have actual read on Emergent Consensus and realize that the code is now completely divergent in every way from Bitcoin Core.

Lighthouse launched half dead because it didn't had built-in projects discoverability and because it was not a decentralized app at all. 
Lighthouse servers, lightlist.io and any support the app had is long gone. I mean, the  project died all the way back when the "official launch" of BitcoinXT happened. 
In all the time I followed how it was doing, off 100 projects, I think I saw less than 10 being funded. 3 of them being for DarkWallet and 2 for lighthouse development which is now ironic. So, the answers to your questions is NO and NO. 
Lighthouse as a crowdfunding app idea was a good one. But I can only see it as worthwhile long term if it is done as a decentralized app with built-in project discoverability. Maybe it could be done with a fork of OpenBazaar or just done as a ZeroNet site-app. Let's wait and see.
I checked back on it via the vinumeris projects gallery site. I wonder if Hearn returned all the money pledged to Lighthouse. It results that it had raised $24,000 USD in Bitcoin from people for improvements and supposedly $1,000,000 for a future revamp. I am going to guess that he did since if he didn't there would be a hell of a lot more people pissed about it going away.

I would say that the only hard part of Bitcoin for the average user that remains is Buying and Selling. And even that has got significantly easier in the last 12 months. On everything else the usage flow, even when it comes to Hodling has got easy enough. What we still need a lot more of are Integrations. Into apps and services of all kinds. Adoption needs to keep growing.

No. Use copay. It runs on all platforms. Just secure your backup. Only use wallets where you control the private key. You may also want to look at a hardware wallet like keepkey or at a way to secure your backup physically like the cryptosteel. 
Finally: Manage your risks cautiously and steadily. Using Bitcoin is 100% geared to personal responsibility.

**For those not wanting to read a wall of text. Here is what RBF means in practice**:
In-Transit Transactions have never been irrevocable. They have always depended on having a fee to not have the risk of being double-spent because it creates a larger window of opportunity for it to happen. No-Fee transactions on average always got delayed anywhere from 3x to 10x the time for 1 confirmation. But since late 2013 they are most likely to get stuck in limbo. 
Replace by fee solves that and just makes a previously advanced method an automatic one. 
It is bad because it breaks Zero-Conf. Which is true, unless there is a priority fee as that means 1st confirmation arrives within 5 minutes, 10 max. Otherwise the window to double spend a transaction with a normal/standard fee before it reaches 1 confirmation is a matter of 10-15 minutes. Or 15-30 minutes if it done with a low-fee. And it is true that that is a disaster for all transactions done in person. As all in-person transactions will have to depend on a payment processor or absorb the risk which is something that could hurt Bitcoin Adoption.

Well, the whole point of lighthouse was that all crowdfunding was for a fixed goal. If the fixed goal was not met, no bitcoin would be exchanging hands. 
One of the theoretical updates it could have had is that it would had been able to introduce more control on funds distribution once a fixed amount was met. This done via multi-sig and by separating the funding in several transactions. Meaning that funds would be only accesible as goals were met by the project. And obviously goal would only be done if the funding for that goal was unlocked for the project. Which is something that was not really developed or thought in full by hearn just vaguely hinted at as far as I know. But that is how I would personally think it should had be done if Lighthouse had continued to be developed. I do also think that would go a long way to keep projects honest and humble. And it would also serve as a strong tell you if a someone is  truthful and genuine in their intentions with a project. Because since it is an optional feature, if you see a new project from someone unknown, but you see that it has this option turned on for their project, then it is a lot easier to take a chance on it. 
On the scamming front. Well, in the case of this approach, the first step is obviously clarity and transparency on making the point across that it is a high-risk endeavor with no solid guarantees. Which sounds like an obvious thing to have, but, you really don't see this point made as well as it should be on anything related to funding when it comes to all of the cryptocurrency space. 
Now, there are other solutions to mitigate scamming even further. Just that that is a whole other long discussion. But I do know that there are 4 different companies still working at it from 4 different angles. It is just taking a long of time to see any results. All relating to portable reputation tied to provable identities. In this case identity not meaning it being a legally registered name.

The trick is that you never give it more than 1/3 of the auth. Meaning that you should not use it as 1 sig of a 2/2 wallet. Only as 1 sig of a 2/3 sigs wallet or 3/5 sigs wallets.  It is also very important that each sig has a passphrase securing the seed. 
On multi-sig everyday use? I have a 1/1 wallet with $100. 2/3 for anything above $100. But I still have passphrase for the seed and password for spending. Because you should never be lazy with security.

Let me give you a few simplified answers: Any currency becomes real by usage, and with usage, it having a market for it. And with a market,  then it can be exchanged for other currencies. Which then initiates a price discovery process. It was hard to create as it leveraged 20+ of information technology advancements that were put together the right way at a time it became possible to do so and for it be possible to be deployed and it being accepted and nurtured. For example. Something like Bitcoin was just simply impossible to have done previous to 2005.  Satoshi left its project as its lead dev a very long time ago. So, no. No one can ask him anything.

Linio is a sort of like buy.com clone.   The top e-commerce sites in Mexico are: ML and Linio. But there is also other more traditional sites. But 2015 saw competition skyrocket as Amazon.com.mx arrived. Ebay.com itself now fully supports Mexico buyers. Aliexpress and Overstock added support for mexico. Famsa did a makeover for their online store. But in perspective all this is not as surprising once you see that in Mexico the e-commerce space growth is like 200% per year and has been so for the past 5 years.

CryptoThrift is no doubt the rightful successor to Coingig and bitmit. Soon to be 1 year old. Bitmit failed because it got hacked, it introduced monetization way too late and was growing too fast. Coingig on the other hand also didn't got to monetize right away and was also rumored to be hacked. In Both cases it was not really because they were not successful enough but other factors.  Of the other available Bitcoin marketplaces the only good ones are onewallet.io since it is from the same guys that do coinsfortech, glyde and gli.ph. Bitpremier is good but not really for a general userbase.

The short explanation is that you cannot say it is impossible. But for it to be possible in a range where it had any possible relevance would meant you used compromised wallet software. In regular conditions your chances of that happening are 1 in a trillion figuratively speaking.

As others have stated. Mining Pooling eliminated the need for miners, even those that small to run a full node. The discussion on the need for incentives for full nodes has been ongoing in the last year or so. Justus Ranvier has added that Full Nodes should get compensated by those operating SPV client wallets. Personally I argue that is not enough incentive because those operating SPV client wallet will of course run 1 full-node + use a Block explorer API for other things if needed. Hence you still end up with few Full-Nodes my theoretical solution would be to modify Full-Nodes to be able to run more complex information channels tied to blockchain transactions or for them to do special processes in the case of At-Blockchain transactions. The last are the ones that serve more than 1 purpose as it is the case of lets say those that carry file hashes in a on-blockchain transaction that then is used to verify file integrity automatically or similar things. Then a micropayment channel for Full-nodes as Justus Ranvier argues on is indeed useful as then the incentives are enough for people wanting to run a full-node for more than altruistic reasons. The elusive answer now is how to make that happen.  Now, of course the issue is more complex than that, but I am giving you the summarized version of several arguments.

It will run on the B+ but according to others than have done it. It don't lasts running uninterrupted more than 1 week or 2 like that. A Pi 2 or Odroid C1 on the other hand will be able to run it without problems long term. Another good and simple choice is running it on the HP Stream 7. As it is only $99 and can be had for as low as $125 with a 64gb microsd or 128 usb drive and shipping. Usually it will be more like $140. I  add that as an option because it is good to remember that a full node total cost in a Pi2 is more like $75 once you include S&amp;H + a 64gb msd or 128gb usb drive.

This store is supported by Xapo. There is no reason to doubt them over something like this. Just record the process and if the key is invalid reclaim to Xapo.

Actually huge news for Bitcoin in Mexico, I can assure you of that. Here in Mexico we only need Linio to accept it and we will be in great shape. But having MercadoLibre and Famsa accepting it is a big deal. Internationally Overstock does supports Mexico, but the prices are insane. I also have on good authority that Rakuten will enable international support for Bitcoin and that it will include Mexico. Just unknown how long it will take. But it is now official that 2015 was the year when Bitcoin started to have traction in Mexico. 2016 looks really good. Now the only thing will be hoping that Bank Of Mexico decides to not comment in January on Bitcoin like they did in 2014 and 2015 or that they comment positively.

Translation to English:
**Price of Bitcoin on SurBitcoin Venezuela is 26% lower than in other countries**.
*The cryptocurrency is selling at 496 dollars on SurBitcoin(Venezuelan Exchange Rate), 200 dollars less than the worldwide average*.
Today, a piece of news has surprised many users of SurBitcoin, The main exchange of the cryptocurrency in Venezuela. The buy/sell prices of Bitcoin, that are updated by the second on that website, are much lower than the worldwide average for the currency. Mistake? Fear? What happened?
If we take a look at CoinMarketCap, we can see that on Wednesday morning the average price for the currency is 672 dollars on several different exchanges around the world. This means that in Venezuela, the price of each Bitcoin should be over 696,000 bolivars, taking in count the conversion values that BitVen gives out, which is a price calculator for the Bitcoin-Bolivar exchange rate (Parallel Dollar -a reference in this kind of operations- is at 1.036 bolivars).
However, the prices at SurBitcoin Venezuela today have been seen between the 510,000 and 538,00 bolivars (496 to 520 dollars), meaning, people are selling the cryptocurrency at 176 dollars less than in the rest of the world. We are talking about a 26% reduction of its price. 
One of the hypothesis of this big fall in price is that many people, because of the high cost of living, just need bolivares for their daily sustenance and are forced to sell their bitcoins that they had been saving up. In fact, one similar situation is happening with the dollars, that many Venezuelans have now been forced to sell at much lower exchange prices than the registered in websites like Dolar Today. 
Nonetheless, Why this fall in prices occurred precisely today?
Added to this situation is the fact that SurBitcoin has informed users through their Facebook page that they have been having problems with the integration of their API with Banesco.
[ Text In Picture reads as follows ]
*Good Night,*
*Esteemed customers, we want to announce that the  API integration with Banesco is going to be in maintenance until Wednesday. Even then, deposits verification will also restart until Wednesday. We are sorry for the caused discomfort. Please, request your withdrawals again on Wednesday*. 
*Good Night,*
[ End of Text in Picture ]
Likewise, the situation could be related to a news report that appeared on the website *La Patilla* that links the cryptocurrency with the Venezuelan wealthy class. We will talk extensively of this news report in another post. 
Now we have to wait until the waters clear out, to know if it is a temporary problem that affects SurBitcoin or if the money shortage crisis in Venezuela (Or other cause) is what is driving the prices down.

I use MercadoLibre and I will first try buying something with Bitcoin via MercadoPago next week. On Famsa? No, I won't use Bitcoin there since everything they sell is usually anywhere from 10% to 20% more expensive than I can get it elsewhere. Including MercadoLibre. But I am happy they accept it. If Linio accepts it, I will do use that as I have bought stuff in Linio before too.

I certainly believe that the Bitcoin Average Exchange Price should rise above $1000 USD again in 2016. 
But unless he misspoke and he meant that the BAEP will go higher than $1200, which i agree it should happen. There is no way in hell it will go up to $25,000 USD x BTC in 2016. Hell, at this point a $2500 USD high for 2016 seems wildly optimistic and i don't even think it would be a good thing for it to go higher than that as it would mean another big crash shortly after and a miserable 2017.

Translation to English:.
**Price of Bitcoin on SurBitcoin Venezuela is 26% lower than in other countries**.
*The cryptocurrency is selling at 496 dollars on SurBitcoin(Venezuelan Exchange Rate), 200 dollars less than the worldwide average*.
Today, a piece of news has surprised many users of SurBitcoin, The main exchange of the cryptocurrency in Venezuela. The buy/sell prices of Bitcoin, that are updated by the second on that website, are much lower than the worldwide average for the currency. Mistake? Fear? What happened?
If we take a look at CoinMarketCap, we can see that on Wednesday morning the average price for the currency is 672 dollars on several different exchanges around the world. This means that in Venezuela, the price of each Bitcoin should be over 696,000 bolivars, taking in count the conversion values that BitVen gives out, which is a price calculator for the Bitcoin-Bolivar exchange rate (Parallel Dollar -a reference in this kind of operations- is at 1.036 bolivars).
However, the prices at SurBitcoin Venezuela today have been seen between the 510,000 and 538,00 bolivars (496 to 520 dollars), meaning, people are selling the cryptocurrency at 176 dollars less than in the rest of the world. We are talking about a 26% reduction of its price. 
One of the hypothesis of this big fall in price is that many people, because of the high cost of living, just need bolivares for their daily sustenance and are forced to sell their bitcoins that they had been saving up. In fact, one similar situation is happening with the dollars, that many Venezuelans have now been forced to sell at much lower exchange prices than the registered in websites like Dolar Today. 
Nonetheless, Why this fall in prices occurred precisely today?
Added to this situation is the fact that SurBitcoin has informed users through their Facebook page that they have been having problems with the integration of their API with Banesco.
[ Text In Picture reads as follows ]
*Good Night,*
*Esteemed customers, we want to announce that the  API integration with Banesco is going to be in maintenance until Wednesday. Even then, deposits verification will also restart until Wednesday. We are sorry for the caused discomfort. Please, request your withdrawals again on Wednesday*. 
*Good Night,*
[ End of Text in Picture ]
Likewise, the situation could be related to a news report that appeared on the website *La Patilla* that links the cryptocurrency with the Venezuelan wealthy class. We will talk extensively of this news report in another post. 
Now we have to wait until the waters clear out, to know if it is a temporary problem that affects SurBitcoin or if the money shortage crisis in Venezuela (Or other cause) is what is driving the prices down.

Yes. You can have a sig be a PC, one be a mobile, one be a tablet, one be ledger nano and one be a web sig from the one hosted by coloredcoins.org or by yourself if you have the know how and resources. 
2/3 is secure. 3/5 is very secure. But you still need to have each sig password protected. But yes that would make for an option to a hardware wallet. 
I have one copay wallet which is 2/3 and I have a sig be web and the others are in my smartphone and in pc. That way I can transact from it from a single device without any problem.

People are saying that Coinbase is as compliant and stuck up as a bank. That is not true. They go way further in their compliance and proactive monitoring compared to a regular bank, western union, currency exchange or paypal. I would compare them with a medical insurance company in terms of how sensitive and invasive they feel the need to be. Also good to remember is that Coinbase is now effectively an Online Bank as you can hold Fiat and Bitcoin accounts with them. Both with insurance.

I will explain the why of the judgment further in case it is not clearly understood based on the actual case: The judge did the right thing based on Florida Law. Specially since they only got him via a technicality that does not proves ill intent, just procedurally presumes it. Which is the gist of the why the judge also felt it made no sense to apply money laundering charges. Specially since for it to be money laundering, you would need to prove the Bitcoin came about from illicit actions too which they did not argued on or could have proven. Add to that the fact on Bitcoin being an asset on a federal level and unclear at the state level. She then decided to go with the law at federal level. Meaning the guy could not have being doing money laundering. Since prosecution would had needed to prove the bitcoins come from ill intent. Not that the act of just selling them to someone that may be a criminal is equal to that. Which should be absurd enough on its on. But it is absurd on a legal basis if you take it that Bitcoins are not yet defined as money on Florida and an asset at federal level. Selling property is perfectly legal on Florida.

I would like to see a Bitcoin Donation Widget Button tied to an HD wallet in the backend that can automatically generate a new destination address for that button each time the widget code is added into a new post page. 
Then once that wallet gets a minimum amount, Its funds are then sent to a predetermined address. The business model would be to simply take a 0.5% cut once funds are redirected. Or maybe simply charge $10 USD a year for the service.  
It would like a mix of a simple but well done donate bitcoin widget and what mycelium gear does. Just not hosted by the user. Yet with the user in full control of the funds as the point for the service would be to never hold more than the minimum funds for each user. 
I also have other ideas, but that one I would like to see done sooner rather than later.

This article takes advantage of the misuse of the word decentralized vs distributed. To the point it even starts up from that proper nomenclature misuse problem. Then it creates a narrative based on the assumption his findings happen to be novel to anyone that had actually read the papers on the lightning Network. And a shocking revelation to anyone that has not read on it. 
That's of course. Not the case.  But, It is quite obvious that the objective is to rile people up and advocate for bigger blocks, because that is the only obvious possible motive. So, on that regard. It is a good effort.
For the longest time, it was understood that lightning network was the way to make "credit unions" for bitcoin possible.  Well, at least it was as a concept on discussion by the wayside. So, there is obviousy a problem of clarity in that LN has not been properly presented by those who proposed it. Which is not that much of a conspiracy or a coverup since the LN development for implementation cannot start without it being actually done on the Bitcoin Mainnet.

It is of course possible and doable even for newcomers. but having it all set up for you to be able to do so is of course not easy, fast, or cheap.  You don't have to take my word for it though.

@_date: 2017-06-27 00:46:30
They had already messed with litecoin. Until they realized they would not had been able to stop segwit for long on it and that it was not worth the effort to do it versus the gain of the coin going up. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:08:15
Hah, I also fit the bill of that. Looking forward to seeing what article you end up writing.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:27:53
I would also like to know where to look up that info. No seems to have a straight answer about lately. I am curious about.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:57:40
I think your "friend" either didn't sent you anything or may have shared with you the actual private key for the wallet the Bitcoin was in. In anyway, I still don't understand the use of pastebin at all in this situation. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:35:36
Well, then you can put $10K on each path and see what does better over 12months. You can afford not having to choose. I wish you the best of luck.

Oh yeah! The story and characters are more than OK but not really great. But when it comes to the technical details, it is probably the very best so far. The show consultants ended up pushing protonmail to add a personal log feature. It also revived interest in several tools that had not been popular for a while.

It would had been more futuristic and 2015 worthy if it sold those new weed e-cigs. 
Sorry, I meant those newfangled Marijuana Flower Bud Use And Discard Electronic Cigarettes.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:34:48
If you are serious. Go to paxful, localbitcoins or virwox. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:23:24
That's the thing. The way multicoin wallets need to be developed usually means they cannot be as secure or as robust as wallet that only specializes in a single coin. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:27:50
I know why. Microsoft will pretty kill any support to any app that is mostly a Windows Phone 7 app and the WP7 app store in December.  They will do this with all old not fully updated/upgraded apps.

It is only good for a single restore UNLESS you check mark the opt in option that says you just want to check your backup works. This is shown briefly in the video too. Otherwise you need to do a new one once you have restored and reloaded a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:05:25
Ok, now it is up again.
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:28:03
They got in at $1000-$2000. They are fine. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:24:28
I would not recommend them and have not recommended them for years now. The age of Bitcoin Faucets is long gone. Specially nowadays. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:58:46
Discuss this on the current pinned price thread 
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:39:56
check localbitcoins(.)com and paxful(.)com
@_date: 2017-06-20 04:54:10
No, some people are trying to do that. But it will take a while.  Years.
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:15:00
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:31:30
ok, how about using bitsquare for those. I know they support a lot of altcoins. Go check if they support those, I don't really know. Only advise I can give you given your extremely specific situation.

From what I read. Unless he was a rogue agent. That is highly doubtful.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:01:52
Yes, at least $100 within 18 months.

Read the pinned FAQ thread or/and ask your question again there.

As someone who did edited on Wikipedia, even if it was a long time ago since I did. One of the things about it is that Wikipedia is about what has already come to past. Not what is happening or what will happen.  This is why, Wikipedia top editors over you will not allow your write up. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:32:23
He is either lying or something else is going on. There is really not that much I can help you further without seeing what he sent you. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:14:25
go to paxful or localbitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:26:45
there is a solution: use a specialized one for bitcoin. use a multicoin wallet for the rest. That means 2 wallets.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:16:18
Oh, that is risky. I had read it was scammy. Unless that by now the amount has arrived? Even if it was not stolen. From what I read it is also very slow. So, yeah, not much to do in this case. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:30:07

umm, maybe, but I would certainly need more info to help figuring out what exactly you mean by link.  
@_date: 2017-06-05 23:20:19
Not new. It has been around for over a year, but it indeed a scam. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:28:26
Do not spam mention. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:46:35
Glad that you are ok. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:17:52
They also work on all platforms. They can be secured a lot further.  You can use them for multisg and they are simply a lot more developed.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:36:19
Because they sure as hell don't want the general public to know that. It is absurd those kind of stats are not available even in their ethstats sites. 
@_date: 2016-07-15 21:09:39
That is such a fire starter of a question, I doubt someone will answer it appropriately. But nothing stops you from following both subreddits and make up your own mind about it.

Best inclusion has been in Almost Human. Where bitcoin was fully mainstream as a secondary currency. And its use was implied as common. Still sad it got cancelled. It was really good. I think Mr. Robot will probably be the second best inclusion of Bitcoin. Or maybe it will end up being the best one. Specially since it also puts Bitcoin in competition with E-Coin which is of course filtered through as EvilCoin.
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:49:25
Unless you are willing to risk $3000 on getting what you would need to mine and be willing to put the time across 12months for you to get ROI. I would say that even at this price. You are better off just buying the bitcoin and holding.
