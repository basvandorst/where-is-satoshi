Shapeshift is run by a former spy and they have industry-leading Blockchain analysis. Definitely not a tumbler.

Further proof that USB + Tails + Electrum = winning

TAILS is a live Linux operating system that routes all network traffic through Tor, which prevents anyone from seeing your real IP address. If you install Tails to a USB stick, you can boot a computer into Tails without having to install anything because it loads the entire OS onto your RAM - it doesn't even touch your hard drive. 
Normally, everything you do within Tails is erased when you reboot (amnesic). But Tails has a "persistence" feature which creates an encrypted partition in the leftover space on your USB stick. This partition requires a password to open when you boot into Tails, but the things within the partition are not deleted when you reboot. If you install your wallet (Electrum is my preferred client) in that persistent partition, then your transactions will be untraceable because your wallet will never be tied to your actual IP address.
tl;dr - If you run your wallet from an amnesic operating system that routes all traffic through TOR (like TAILS), even highly-trained computer scientists will be unable to identify you.

Yeah, it looks fine. Well, except the part that sends your SSN to Russian hackers.

I don’t understand how Venmo got so popular - even over PayPal. It’s garbage and the way it makes you write in a purpose for the transaction is begging for this kind of scrutiny.
