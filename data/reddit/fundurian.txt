hi grandma, this is bitcoin, a virtual money that you cannot touch or feel, but it exist on the internet
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:40:13
what i mean is, let say you have 1 bitcoin on the localbitcoin, what happen after the hardfork? can you access both btc and btu? or you can only access btc but not btu and hence you losses your part of the btu forever
