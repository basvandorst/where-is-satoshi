This sounds very typical of the occupy protesters: naive. No revolution in the history of the world was 100% supported. Neither the French Revolution nor the American revolution had 100% support. Quite the contrary, it was more like 5-10% of the population were truly willing to fight for what the believed in with the majority of the population being largely indifferent. Read Malcom Gladwell's *Tipping Point* for more info. 
Do you really think that by some stroke of luck there will be a revolution that is supported by 100% of the population? Really? This will never happen. Ever. Grow up, get a clue and start finding more pragmatic solutions.

There are three large darknet markets in operation right now, with around a dozen or so smaller markets. The silk road was just the first market, but rest assured, you will be able to shop on the darknet for years to come as long as drugs are illegal. 
So yeah, if you are still interested in buying something, you can. I actually think that these darknet markets are what's driving bitcoin. Have you ever seen the documentary "Cocaine Cowboys"? It's about the cocaine trade in Miami in the 80s. One of the points they make is how the cocaine trade transformed Miami from a sleepy retirement community to a bustling trade hub for legitimate business. The reason why the drug trade caused this transformation was because there were so many drug dealers flush with cash that there was a ton of demand for all kinds of goods and services, which stimulated and grew the economy. 
The darknet markets will be able to do the same thing. One of the more challenging aspects of selling drugs the darknet is converting the btc to usd or whatever. It's tricky and you also bring on the risk of money laundering and tax evasion charges. An alternative would be to just spend bitcoins directory on whatever goods and services that the drug dealers need. This kind of economic activity will cause more and more businesses to accept bitcoin, which will in turn increase the rate of adoption for more legitimate transactions.

You have to realize that whatever happens in America precedes action in the rest of the world. Most western governments are based on the representative democracy founded in the United States.

This video is targeting Americans because if Americans can mount a successful revolution and overthrow the current oligarchy then the rest of the world will do the same. It's really that simple.

I actually agree with you on the failures of democracy as well. I've spent some time in r/darkenlightenment and they make some good arguments in favor of a more dictatorial system. 
Beyond that, I actually think that a series of loosely allied decentralized governments could still make democracy work. The problem with federalism is the usurpation of power by the federal government over the last century. This then allows for the majority to trample on the rights of the minority. We've seen this play out over and over again in various forms throughout the rise of federal power. 
Another potentially successful (and potentially disastrous) government would be an enlightened dictator in the form of an AI. I realize that the ai could go skynet or whatever, but it eliminates the potential for a dictatorship to inevitably go sour when a human dictator dies.

Publishing - What used to be the hardest part about getting your book distributed is now the easiest. Platforms like what amazon has as well as the option of just selling directly to the consumer has really been a boon for authors. 
In a broader sense, everything is going to be either decentralized or phase out of existence. It is part of the natural evolution of human society and the human race. It's akin to the changing of the economy from agrarian to industrial and then to knowledge based. This is the next step beyond the information economy.

You're absolutely right, deflationary spirals are a really bad thing. I actually had an idea for a cryptocurrency specifically for governments to use. The legislature can control the level of inflation and the legislature is elected by citizens who are issued a special blockchain address  (like a social security number) issued by the government through this blockchain at the time of birth. The citizen is then able to vote once their address reaches a certain age, and they can vote for other people's addresses at that time. 
The people whose address gets the most votes, is able to cast a vote towards changing the algorithm, as well as the passing other laws proposed by legislatures on the same blockchain.
I just thought of this idea and I don't even know if it's possible or even desirable. The one advantage this system has, that bitcoin also has, is that it renders central banking and fractional reserve banking impossible. I believe this is one of the most important aspects of decentralized cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, their deflationary nature makes them very dangerous. 
One of the problems of deflation we are encountering with bitcoin right now is instability. From the [Wikipedia article on inflation](


We're going to see this scenario play out over and over again with bitcoin. It's really bad for an economy and I bitcoin bitcoin is going to fail to be the world reserve currency because of it. Another problem with bitcoin is that no government is going to use bitcoin. It's going to create its own currency and create demand for it by requiring taxes be paid in this currency and by spending this currency. Governments also like to have the privilege of creating more money. The problem is sometimes they create too much.
A hypothetical constitutional cryptocurrency could set limits on inflation rates while still giving a government control of the nation's currency.

It depends on the collaps, you have two types: deflationary or inflationary. The Great Depression was a deflationary collapse, in this case you'd see a massive selloff of bitcoin because people would want to get as much USD as possible in order to pay debts. This is assuming their creditors won't accept bitcoin, which they probably won't.
In an inflationary collapse, people would be scrambling to buy bitcoin and other solid assets such as gold in an effort to preserve their savings from the debilitating effects of inflation. You can see examples of this in places like Argentina.

The sale of drugs and other is what is driving demand for bitcoins and will ultimately be touted as what kickstarted the legitimate bitcoin economy. 
In the documentary *Cocaine Cowboys* they talk about how Miami was a sleepy little retirement community until the cocaine trade started. The influx of cash and tourism is what grew Miami and made it strong enough to eventually stand on it's own after the cocaine "gold rush" ended. 
The primary mechanism was the numerous drug dealers who were flush with cash. They bought all kinds of luxury goods and services, creating jobs and growing the economy. 
The same is happening with bitcoins and the darknet markets. If you're a drug dealer on the darknet, it's a lot safer to just spend your bitcoin directly rather than trying to convert it to cash. Thus the darknet merchants are driving demand for more legitimate bitcoin merchants. 
If you like to do drugs and are a bitcoin enthusiast, the best thing you can do to help grow bitcoin is buy whatever drugs you want exclusively from the darknet.

Can you really blame someone for favoring gold over bitcoin? They both have their place, but gold has a lot more appeal to most people because you can hold it in your hand and use it to make stuff if you want. Can you make a bitcoin necklace or wedding ring? Didn't think so.

No one is going to shoah anyone. The Holocaust never happened anyway. It's a cold war lie that never died.

That's horrendous. Is this real or a joke?

Evidence gathered illegally? Probably. Was he framed? Doubtful.

Ok, but what happens if the power grid fails? I'm a fan of bitcoin, but I wouldn't store 100% of my wealth in it.

Our cars already run on the sun's energy. People forget that fossil fuels are just the result of plant matter that turned into oil over millions of years. Photosynthesis is, in essence, storing sun energy.

I hope so. I have my doubts as to whether or not customers will just get constantly scammed on that site.

He did try to have someone murdered. That's not something society can easily forgive. I do think that once we end the war on drugs we should pardon all citizens convicted of non-violent drug related crimes.

That actually makes a lot of sense. I would be ok with that as a legal doctrine.

Russia would not be bad at all, IMHO. That would be one of my first choices, especially for the ease with which bitcoin could be traded for cash in that country.

Seriously, they are killing it. They are one of my favorite news outlets.
