Are you sure about that?


Again, are you sure?
Based on my (admittedly little) understanding of bitcoin, you have a "wallet" - which is an encrypted store of your "coins", to which you hold the private key. The encrypted store you host on a server somewhere, plus you also keep a copy of it (regularly you back it up) somewhere safe (presumably multiple "somewheres").
I'm not really sure how all of this stays in sync, but based on what little I've read, it can and does; the backups - if used - sync back to your actual amount (not the amount that they had at time of backup).
In the end - I guess what I am getting at is that bitcoin does away with the need for "banks" - ie, places to "store" money. Now, maybe "banks" will become giant server farms or whatnot to backup bitcoin wallets - but nothing says you would have to use them; I could see them becoming places for people who have no clue as to how to set up a backed-up bitcoin wallet...
As far as "keying in your password" - supposedly this isn't something that is needed, either; a simple QR code on your phone could be scanned (by another phone, even), and that would be your "password". Heck, maybe you could have it tatooed on your body somewhere?
All that said - if you know something that I'm wrong about (and I very well could be), please let me know; I'm trying to stay educated on this. I personally would like to try mining, but I can't justify the outlay for the hardware and energy currently needed (even for a pool). Ultimately, I see it as another hobby that I don't need (robotics, virtual reality, and retro-computing currently eat too much).
