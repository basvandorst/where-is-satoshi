Go through Coinbase to buy bitcoin. You can buy them with your credit card straight away. You have a 4% fee which is shit but it's the easiest way for now. That's what I say to all new investors it's easy and user friendly. 
There are cheaper ways but might need more explanation. 
I do it like this, I top up my revolut account with gbp and then convert it to euros (the exchange rate is awesome). Then I go to my Coinbase euro wallet on the app, under accounts and get the SEPA details (international payment details). 
I then go to revolut, go to send money by bank transfer and enter coinbase' s SEPA details with the reference! Super important part. 
And done, should receive your money in your eur wallet in Coinbase. 
From there, google gdax (à Coinbase exchange) and log in with your coinbase details and do all the verification steps. 
Then you can deposit money on the top left with your Coinbase euro wallet for free. 
Now you go to market tab, choose your price and amount and buy your bitcoin.
It's the work around that works for me. 
Remember not to invest in only one coin, diversify my friend!

Also remember NOT TO STORE YOU COINS in an exchange, especially in these times where bitcoin is worth a shit loads and crackers are interested in the higher value stuff to they will aim for big exchanges. It's happened before and people were left with an apology email. 
Buy a hardware wallet, safest option. Worth the investment.

Great insight my friend. I love the fact that you invested in something weekly. Got me inspired, im on the verge of investing 80% of my savings into this and leaving it there for a bit. I'm nervous but I think it's better than 0.7% interest the bank is offering. Wish me luck. 
All the best mate, have a good one.

Yeah I'm new to Reddit, just testing if I had enough karma to comment. Turns out you don't need karma to comment.

Yeah I agree, what's index funds? The returns can't be as high as investing in currencies right?

Yeah that's happened already I'm afraid
