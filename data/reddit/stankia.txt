Why wasn't it done like, IDK, 5 years ago? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:24:09
Why do people do such things? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:48:21
Or maybe he's not interested in cashing out (much better ways exist than what he's doing now) and he's just buying up the coins that sell below 300.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:39:19
Would the syndicate really want $700 coins?
@_date: 2014-08-21 03:08:13
If they don't they certainly will in the future. We really need to have a serious discussion about ways of making Bitcoin more anonymous as a community.

What's wrong with Bistamp, why should I use MtGox again???
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:11:44
Yeah like you can buy stolen credit cards at your local Walmart. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:42:24
Why do you chose to work for the devil?
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:12:02
Can't think of a joke, someone help me out.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:16:45
I'm not the least bit concerned about this, they can regulate all they want if it makes the feel any better. Bitcoin on it's deepest level cannot be regulated.
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:37:48
Except that no one is buying for a while now.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:47:52
Where is he? Someone should ask.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:34:57
Why do they care about volatility if coinbase and bitpay takes care of that? There is literally nothing to lose.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:48:46
How did you come to the conclusion that he is bashing bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:08:58
100 doge verify
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:30:24
Please, we don't even know what dropped the price in the first place and you guys go around stating it like it's a fact, traders don't give a fuck about the intricacies of the Bitcoin network anyway...
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:10:01
Is your name Brian by any chance?
@_date: 2014-08-26 22:59:35
I thought bit-licenses were only for NY and who gives a fuck about New York..

After a while you get used to it, it becomes like any other internet purchase.

Immigrants. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:27:27
I agree with you man but I think all these new investments are waiting for... SOMETHING. Maybe they're waiting for legit exchanges regulated by the government so they don't burn their hands like with Gox, maybe they're waiting for lower prices, who knows. All we know is that all this money is sitting right now, waiting patiently for the right moment.
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:54:30
Not for the right reasons though amirite lol?
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:06:41
I takes too long to transfer them when there's a pump going.
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:43:07
Can existing altcoins be implemented in the altchain or is this just for new coins? If so why would LTC or any other existing altcoin go along with this?
@_date: 2014-04-02 03:45:08
This baffles my mind also, I mean almost a BILLION dollars disappears and everyone is like "idk lol"...

People who know how to use Tor sure a fuck know where to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:45:56
Don't be fooled this is a classic long con, these guys know very well that Bitcoin cannot be controlled or regulated.
@_date: 2014-04-29 22:20:01
No way the cartels know how to run a business.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:45:27
Can't he be extradited by the Japanese (or wherever he's living right now)?
@_date: 2014-04-19 02:13:45
Why would anyone vote against it?
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:41:52
BTC-e it is then.
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:59:32
Same here. I mean if I had a million dollars I could live of a 5-10% return from traditional stocks and the like. But since I have only a few thousand to invest, Bitcoin seems like the biggest bang for my bucks...
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:49:55
Why TOR-only? If I want to sell or buy something that is perfectly legal I should be able to access it normally. TOR is painfully slow and that will prevent it going mainstream. The end goal here is to replace ebay, right?
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:14:53
Rest assured if someone invests 20M there will be more guys ready to invest another 20M on top of that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:38:18
Who really is going to pay those taxes? Let's be honest here for a minute, this taxation on Bitcoin is such a non-issue.
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:56:29
We can but there will be a fee, likely a quite expensive one.
@_date: 2014-04-05 02:33:32
That and campaign "donations". Bitcoin would solve a lot of problems.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:57:30
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:47:21
The only time I had to use charge-back is because my CC info got stolen because some website decided to store the info unencrypted. Bitcoin solves exactly that, there will be NO NEED for chargebacks.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:25:49
Good luck.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:33:40
Faster confirmations.
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:42:44
My cryptsy account got hacked and the hacker sold all my dogecoins for BTC but was stopped in time before he could withdraw them. Finally two weeks later I got back the access to my account and was not even mad because he sold the doges at twice the price they were selling now, thanks hacker :)
@_date: 2014-04-06 19:29:01
The thing is the Internet had no competitors, everyone benefited from it. Bitcoin on the other hand has very, very powerful ENEMIES.
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:42:26
Please, Mt.Gox was run by a kid.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:08:38
Just because a customer does a chargeback doesn't mean that you lose the product that you sold to the customer.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:59:27
Purchasing books, lol
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:43:38
I didn't do it when Mt.Gox went under and I won't in the future. I understand that risks and only have myself to blame if something bad happens. At this point the convenience outweighs the risks for me and I do in fact feel safer holding BTC on circle than on my own computer that could get infected any time I visit a shady website. And I don't feel like dealing with cold storage, I purchase bitcoins to use as a currency, going through multiple hoops to secure it and then undo all of them to spend it completely defeats the point of a currency for me.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:56:26
Why don't they let the community know what exactly happened and we will figure out the rest.
@_date: 2014-03-17 10:24:11
Well, 50% of the coins have been already mined by the owner before the wallet is released to the public.
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:58:27
I just remembered that newegg also sells other random things, this is great!
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:34:12
I had a nice laugh at this
@_date: 2014-03-20 22:08:39
All I hear is all this great news for a couple of weeks now, but why is the price not rising!?
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:56:31
Who gives a fuck about New York? Bitcoin is global. It could be based in Nebraska for all I care or nowhere at all.
@_date: 2014-09-30 18:21:02
Or you can buy a cheap prepaid sim card at your local gas station (The Wire).
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:50:04
You don't need the banks to be "open". I've been buying all weekend long, day and night.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:25:19
Not everyone knows about Bitcoin, if everyone did the prices would be much higher. My family and most of my friends have no idea what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:12:17
And the price keeps falling.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:44:20
All these new wallets, what's exactly wrong with the original?
@_date: 2014-04-09 05:30:17
It's impossible to control but let them think that it is.
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:57:28
Charge backs are a huge hassle for businesses. There's always some idiot that orders a shirt in Small instead of Medium and only notices it after the 30 day return period expires. What does he do then? He contacts his bank and tells some BS story to get his $8.99 back, the business gets screwed... Charge backs are rarely used for their intended purposes. How many times have you been screwed by a legit retailer and needed to use a charge back?
@_date: 2014-05-01 03:38:42
At this point it's just easier to switch to bitcoin. American banks are like some kind of huge bears, you have to feed and poke them to make them move around a bit.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:07:51
Beta is an overstatement.
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:29:06
@_date: 2014-10-13 23:39:47
Yeah fuck the guy who created a website that every trader uses for free.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:28:05
10 others would take its place, the cat is out of the bag as they say.
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:58:09
I wish they would make a proper POS system for large restaurants. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:26:48
I'd rather have wall street manipulate the markets than the government with so many coins.
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:56:37
It actually would be good news, China is dragging the price down, the new Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2014-06-26 04:14:38
Isn't that what dozens of Bitcoin related startups are already doing?
@_date: 2014-05-23 02:56:11
63TB a year is not that bad really.
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:22:57


@_date: 2014-04-17 00:06:52
To whom?
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:43:06
Yeah, I would rather see 10 bad guys go free than see 1 innocent guy go to jail.
@_date: 2014-06-15 00:18:23
Who says that this has affected the price at all?
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:30:48
The stranger thing is that the market doesn't react to all the good news at all. Just a year ago if this subreddit was filled with all the daily exciting new innovations and projects that we have today the price would have skyrocketed well above 1000...
@_date: 2014-03-10 05:22:06
0.00222907BTC I want my money back! :)
@_date: 2014-04-08 05:23:04
I think the current system of transaction fees is a major fuck up by the Bitcoin developers.
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:59:30
You don't, that's the beauty being in the government.
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:08:44
A high price will do exactly that. My family didn't take it seriously until they heard on the news that it reached $1000...
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:23:06
But still they only book hotels, where is all this profit coming from? The hotels must pay them a lot...
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:26:37
That's the plan.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:29:35
Exchanges are international, it doesn't matter where they're based.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:33:56
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:52:23
This is great, no more typing in my "billing address" every time I want to purchase something online.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:17:35
A bunch of lawyer talk.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:11:05
Is the regular wallet not secure? Has anyone's wallet ever been "hacked"? I'm asking because I've been using bitcoins for a couple of years now and never have thought to myself "geez I wish there was a better wallet"...
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:12:23
What if there's an emergency?
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:41:16
Also think of all the major drug dealing going on in the world. I'm not talking about a kid buying an ounce of weed, I'm talking about million dollar transactions between suppliers and distributors. Back in the day you had to ship pallets of cash, now you can send millions worth of bitcoin to anyone in the world and spend it how you like it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 01:19:50
Did you watch the Casey Anthony trial? Everyone knew she was guilty but there wasn't enough evidence to convict her and I'm OK with that. Thousands of other cases like this.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:13:37
That would be a brilliant move and contrary to popular belief the U.S. Government isn't stupid.
@_date: 2014-03-23 23:15:41
1. Buy Dogecoins
2. Sell Dogecoins on another exchange
3. Profit? 
@_date: 2014-09-19 19:12:35
I know I am. But I'm a long timer and seen it many times before, I mean the last crash went down to $339 and went up to $683 two months later, that's a 100% increase. Same thing is happening here, the bitcoin fundamentals are still the same nothing changed just the price...
@_date: 2014-06-26 04:11:30
Why would a money transmitting company exist in the first place if we go full on bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:55:45
It's a system that works, at least you have the right to defend yourself and there needs to be undeniable evidence against you to be found guilty. Actually in America it's pretty easy to get away with a crime if you have a great lawyer, in other countries they just throw you in jail and let your rot there with no questions asked.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:48:33
These will also increase and get cheaper, Moore's law and all.
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:07:28
Word. All the start-ups and wall street investors that are going to take this whole thing from "beta" to "1.0" are located in the US. Thanks China for pumping up the price but we can take it from here.
@_date: 2014-03-09 00:24:33
Price of Doge is so irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-04-13 00:30:38
Because I have more of them?
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:01:48
Wait is Top Gear back on?
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:46:11
Or just use BTC-e.
@_date: 2014-04-07 02:14:38
What is keeping them from confirming the transactions? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:09:12
You said it yourself: "an investment of $10m (which we the amount of money are seeing on an almost weekly basis going into a BTC start-up)" Where do you think this money is going to go in the future?
@_date: 2014-05-24 05:13:02
Well if it reached a $1000 with almost no infrastructure to support such price, $5k with things that we have now is definitely possible.
@_date: 2014-10-19 21:03:34
Unless you have more than 250k in your account you have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:37:42
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:21:22
What rumors?
@_date: 2014-09-25 00:13:12
I was able to buy on the same day I signed up.
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:59:21
They don't need to understand it. He was a middle man between massive amounts of drugs being sold and bought and he took a cut of the sales, whether this happened over the internet or on the street doesn't matter.
@_date: 2014-11-05 03:04:33
RemindMe! 1 year to check out what has changed.
@_date: 2014-06-26 05:53:09
Yep, as cruel as it sounds these type of grandmas will die out soon...
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:36:24
That's how long it took me to get coins from Coinbase. Believe me I'm here since the early Mt.Gox days and it's a walk in the park to get Bitcoins now compared to those early gloomy days. Circle is even easier from what I hear.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:24:40
I'd be OK with that if good news also influenced the price.
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:29:10
Maybe not screw you over but they sure as fuck could do a better job and until Bitcoin they had no incentive to do that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:38:04
Which side is Coinbase on?
@_date: 2019-11-05 04:45:20
Chicago ain't bad.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:16:12
Crush? No reason to do that. They could buy them out though. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:58:15
How simple minded of you.
@_date: 2015-07-01 01:05:24
Why are people buying it?
@_date: 2017-07-09 06:22:16
Now show me the same data for western countries only going from the 80s until now. I bet it won't look so rosy.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:04:59
And a few Lambos.
