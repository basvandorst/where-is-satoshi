Yep.  My name is mismatched because my basic info name was noted as Greg and the documentation submitted was instead Gregory.  See my note above and to follow me on twitter to keep up to date with my trip to Las Vegas.

Same here. I am going to be in Las Vegas on Dec. 5th and if I am not authorized by then I will be taking a photo of myself at the address they list on their site holding a sign like Kolin Burges outside of Mt. Gox headquarters. 
My sign will instead will read "Bittrex, Where is our Money?"

Andreas wont even call out BitConnect as a scam.  He does not take a position on anything that even hints of controversial.   I agree that Andreas is a great advocate of the crypto space but its as if he has cemented his position in the general area only.  He will not specifically call out bad actors in the space for fear of minimizing his perceived reputation.
