Ancom relies on everyone giving up private property and wages....who decides who get a big house and who gets a studio apartment? How decides who can have a corvette vs a corolla? What incentive do people have to increase  With ancap it's voluntary and mutual exchange. I do a job for a price we agree upon and I can save my money to buy whatever I want too that becomes my property.  Now if you want to create some sort of Commune community within an ancap state that's perfectly fine or if you wanted to create 100% employee owned company where each employee gets an equal share of the profits that's cool too....and would be more likely to succeed versus having a 100% Ancom state....with ancom progress will become stagnant...a commune in an ancap society can at least benefit from the progress created by free market competition.

Don't hate the player, hate the game? I mean if bitcoin is so vulnerable that all it takes is for one pool to gain a majority to threaten it then it's not a very good system IMO.

Won't PayPal defeat the purpose of bitcoin? I thought the whole point was to combat the high fees associated with traditional transactions if they accept bitcoin its still going to be a 3% transaction fee.  This would be better if they said eBay would accept bitcoin payment without going through paypal so you would just have to pay ebay fees not both.
