Ah - thank you. I knew there was an incentive for them to mine empty blocks, I just had it mixed up. Do you by chance know if there's any plan/ideas to combat it or is it a non-issue?

Ask for their cell number and send them a text using Twilio. Twilio also lets you lookup their carrier to make sure it's not Voip (disposable). Then ask them for the code you sent in the text. PS although faxes suck I will be using this everytime I need to send one going forward. Awesome micro-app.

Miners have figured out that they can execute more hashes if they just propose blocks with no transactions.

Never leave a balance in an address that's spent coins*
I could re-use an address that just receives for a period of time until I clear it and update it.

I actually will return it.

Man, show some respect for customer support staff. They're people to. I would take my sweet time answering this ticket if I was spoken to like this.

Bitcoin is grassroots. People showing people. Thank you for increasing Bitcoin's worth just a bit.

It's a sweet idea depending on who/what you trust to "lookup" the name to a Bitcoin address.
For example, if you use a slick easy API to search the namecoin blockchain, you are trusting that API provider to give you the correct Bitcoin addresses and not their own (or if they're hacked the hackers).
If you run your own namecoin node and code the interaction between your website and the node running on the server, then you can be pretty sure you're doing correct lookups.
Edit: Also remember you're trusting the namecoin blockchain, a far weaker network than Bitcoin.
