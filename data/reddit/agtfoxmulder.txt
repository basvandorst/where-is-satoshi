It happens more than you'd think. Bars that sell to visibly intoxicated people, has stations, etc can be held partially responsible. It usually has to do with minors, but it can happen with adults as well.

Glad I quit buying drugs with their btc

Never! Well...for a couple of guys.

That's what I wasn't sure about. I suppose if they're still reporting sales, they're still paying taxes, regardless of payment method. I wasn't very awake when I was thinking about the feds, ha.

That's the craziest part. They've been waiting for months. Or up to a year if I remember right? It had to happen at some point, I think. Having an actual site was too much attention. It used to be very secretive and e-mail only before tor and I knew a secure site was too good to last forever.

A lot of people were donating just to attach a message for the FBI. I'm sure there wasn't 5btc worth, though.

Too bad neither have 1/100 the vendors and quality.

Of course. I'm just still in panic mode. As long as the SR forums stay up there should be a good transition.

Fuck him. 
EDIT: I'm just irritated that he was sloppy and I lost something that mattered to me. It's all good. Sorry for being dickish, guys.

It means I lost a good bit of mine.

It seems like a win/win for business owners. You get cheaper transactions, people come to you just because you accept bitcoins, and you get free advertising. 
Until the feds come knocking, maybe.

Yeah. My favorite vendor ever was going to tough it out and just said he's going to cash out instead.
