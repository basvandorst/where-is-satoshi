So in your scenario he did or did not create it?

Generally not income taxes. I don't think most people are advocating the abolition of all taxes, but income taxes, especially those collected at the federal level are wasteful and detrimental to society and the economy. 
Income tax is usually the largest portion of a person's tax burden, it is the least voluntary and the individual has the least influence in how this tax is allocated.

The old white man thing is stupid, but this comment is even dumber because it's very obvious that old white men of today will be replaced by other old white men, and I'm pretty sure that technology and innovation has blossomed for a few decades now.

What part? And why? The DDoS I'm guessing couldn't be done slowly, you mean setting up the relays then?
Looking at [this]( page, which I don't know if it's accurate or if I'm looking at the right thing, but there are only around 5000 relays. So if you set up ~ 500 you could be routing 1/10th of all traffic, and the with the DDoS I would think that's enough to analyse and see the spike to get the right IP. I'm just guessing though. I would love an explanation as to why this can't work or what I'm missing because I'm not 100% on how Tor works.

Purse is was the catalyst that finally got me using bitcoin, bought a few things, so far so good. Just really wish they could integrate eBay for Christmas, much better prices there than amazon.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:03:24
That sucks, but fortunately I already got my item, it was a digital good, so everything worked out well. Now I'm actually trying out buying some through Purse.io which is awesome to get a 30% discount on Amazon.

I find it humorous speculation exists that a person who creates a cryptological currency built around anonymity would use anything resembling their actual name.

Hard drive renting is the way of the future. It's perfect those people that can't afford their own hard drive or don't want to get locked into a lengthy hard drive payment plan. It's also good for wealthy people as well who might want a summer hard drive at the shore or a second hard drive in the mountains. 
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:06:58
Yes, I ended up using it, worked very well!

You don't actually get Karma for self posts anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:32:38
Could they set up lots of relays though for the same effect on a hidden service?
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:34:47
I think you may have answered your own question there.
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:49:42
Well, that was easy. Thanks, Circle seemed to be the answer to all of those if it worked as it said it did..
@_date: 2014-10-14 01:42:04
Thanks I'll check circle out, I was looking to make a few small purchases on Cryptothrift and need to figure out how to get bitcoins without much hassle.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:21:03
lol, you seemed so taken aback too
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:26:46
I don't exactly understand what use it properly means. If you use it all you will be selling, correct? If you buy something, you are essentially selling the bitcoins at the market price at that time. Unless the price stabilizes it's not really possible to "use it properly" and if it stabilizes it doesn't really matter where it stabilizes.
If you want to use it properly, there is no reason to hold bitcoins that I can figure out.
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:29:55
Can you explain why not? Just from reading it I thought it sounded plausible, but I don't know too much about TOR.
Edit: Also maybe it was relays and not exit nodes they set up if that would matter.
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:59:22
I thought they got the IP Address by setting up a lot of TOR exit nodes and then doing a staggered DDOS attack on Silk Road, then they analyzed the exit node traffic and found which IP address was spiking when they had the DDOS attack active. 
Is there some reason why this wouldn't work?
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:07:02
You wouldn't even need to use TOR. Just drive around and use an open wifi. The problem would be spending your money on anything large anonymously.

Well kwh is amount of killowatts used per hour, right? Example if I use 2 killowatts of electricity for 2 hours, it's 2 kwh. If i use 0.5 Kw for 4 hours its 2kwh, so dividing the total number of killowatts used by the number of bitcoins produced per hour I think yields kwh. It's not really a guess, there is definitely a formula. The guess part is what is the average efficiency of mining hardware.
@_date: 2014-10-14 05:06:31
I have known about bitcoin for a while, but I was looking for a particular item and it was found on crypto thrift via some google searching and forums, which is what made me actually want to use it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:13:58
Hey, this is great, and I had an idea, similar. It could possibly help you implement. If you make some kind of "reputation score" for the buyer/sellers, that is shown to each party, but how still protects their anonymity. Such as have them verify things like eBay or Amazon accounts with a lot of feedback, you could even add things like FaceBook, or other social media just to build a sort of online credit rating that isn't an actual credit rating. I wanted to call it something like "netcred" taking from streetcred or something like that, anyway I think it's pretty cool. All the steps involved with purchasing bitcoin has made me not want to do it yet.

Cities and Counties already build and maintain roads. Private companies also build toll roads already. I wouldn't advocate for no government but I think the least amount of spending decisions possible should be at the federal level, because they are obviously the most disconnected from the population. I wish that every state was much more different from the others. I would say that Healthcare, military and some of the regulatory agencies are pretty much all the federal government needs and most of that paid for with import tariffs and other forms of taxation.
@_date: 2014-03-21 08:32:15
So if we took that number, and divided it by the average efficiency of mining hardware in gigahashes per watt. Then divide by 1000 to get KiloWatts, then divide by 150 (150 btc an hour), we would get the kilowatthours per bitcoin, does that sound right?
If it were possible to get the average efficiency at all.
So [(Total GH/S / Avg. Efc PW) / 1000]  / 150 = kwh per btc

TigerDirect is like one of the top 5 shopping sites for tech stuff online, if not higher, I can't see how 


I like pretty much everything about them...

It's not really a ponzi scheme, as it's true to what it is on the surface and decentralized. It's just mimicking a ponzi scheme in the way people are investing in it and most likely the eventual outcome.

Maybe I'm being too literal but millions haven't made millions. At most a few thousand people have made a few million.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:37:27
Did they actually fund the transactions? 
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:43:03
Cool. Thank you for the explaining.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:03:40
How long does it actually take for a bitcoin transaction to go down? Doesn't every person mining have to get it or something like that?
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:14:21


That's life changing so is the few thousand that made several 100K. Not arguing that, just that millions of people, didn't make millions of dollars. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 07:06:28
Are you implying that the facts are somehow untrue?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:34:26
How will you get the coins? Just mining?
