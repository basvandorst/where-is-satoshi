Hi Iruwen,
Thanks for your candid feedback! This is what I'm after!
To address some points made;
1. It's not a data aggregation algorithm at all. I do collect data via crawling but that is raw data that I then feed in to amazon comprehend to detect future dates based off the publication date of an article (among a few other NLP use cases). Thus, being AI driven.
2. Indeed the load more might not be necessary, based off other feedback I could easily make that change!
3. What kind of extra details would you be looking for in the overview or the details? I am trying to keep it as automated as possible without any manual editing, so if you have some suggestions on what your expectations are here, that would be great.
4. I totally agree, this is absolutely in beta, but I'm launching early for this very reason, feedback and fix. I recently quit my job to pursue building ideas and businesses for the following year so I will not be one of those sites that doesn't make it beyond that stage. I plan to build a business from this, whether it sticks to crypto or moves on to pivot to another industry is the only question.

I only see this reply via my inbox. In the actual page I only see your first comment and then no further nested comments. Doesnt matter if i try it in other browsers, or in incognito, I cannot see any further comments! Weird!
Reddit is broken :(

Hmm, I made a really long reply addressing your points you made but now it seems to have been removed and I have no idea why?
