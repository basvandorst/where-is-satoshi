The filthy rich old grey billionaire men?  What would any of them know about investing?

I have more interesting things to do.  Also I was not referring to Galloway.

How interesting, I had no idea Moses spoke in Latin.

To the ancient Hebrews the supposed word of their god was, for all intents and purposes, legislation.  So you could replace "government" or "nation state" with "authority".  If your point was that


then I would just consider that nitpickery as most people don't live under religious authority these days, and you could argue that government, in the broad sense, is any body that governs.

There are plenty of countries like that, and they are not the utopias you have in your dreams, they're the ones at the top of "The World's Shittiest Countries" list.

A valid transaction was recorded on the blockchain, what's the problem?
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:18:40
Nope, because when I see a paywall I'd no longer like to read it.

Let me know the next time you have to transfer a cent and you're worried about the 1 cent fee.
