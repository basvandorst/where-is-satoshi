Do you earn 2 Bucks a day with 1 miner at home? Don't get me wrong i never tried BTC Mining at home by my own but if i calculate it with 1200 watt for 24/7 one year with a price of 0.17 Rp/kwh (I live in switzerland and therefore i reckon my prices for kwh) i have to pay 1787.04 CHF divided by 365 days result in 4.89 CHF so i have to mine at least 5 CHF to earn 0.11 Rp every day. Maybe you have other prices or better price condition in this case get your chance and buy as much miners as you can but if you live at home with electricity prices like me you better mine with a pool. 
P.s. usd/chf exchange rate is 1$=0.93chf

But at home with 1 or to 2 miners? Sure it's still worth but with a big pool like antpool, slushpool or Bitclub. But at home with ome miners i think you will pay more for electricity than you will receive trough mining it's just my opinion like i said he has to try it by himself and see how much he get from mining and how much he pays for electricity.

Can you tell something about keepkey in comparsion to the trezor wallet? Like how many coins can you store, how long does it usually takes for 1 tx and how high are the fees. I want to buy one but i can't decide between keepkey and trezor.

I think bitcoin Mining at home is not worth anymore because of the difficulty. I would mine bitcoin with at a third party something that is noted in the blockchain every other coin is no problem for mining at home, but you have to try it on your own an see if you agree with your revenue
