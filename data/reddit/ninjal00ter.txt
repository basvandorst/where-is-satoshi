He is really good at his job, the guy is a multi millionaire balls deep...what you are missing is his job is not to make you money, but the other way around.

BofA are crooks left them long ago, they werent complaining when they got bailed out by our tax dollars for all the shady stuff they did with Countrywide.

I think that in order for Bitcoin to be a usable currency it needs to be worth a rediculous amount...say 10 million dollars? That way the fluctuations will have minimal impact to the common man who gets paid 500000 satoshis per year.

What if the supply is maxxed out and a large majority of the coins are held by a connected group of investors, they could possibly take control to a certain extent.

If Im not mistaken do I spy a double bottom pattern with a morning star forming on the daily? A little more green volume and enough momentum could result in a nice move to the upside

do you trust your wife? Because if you do trust her, there's no reason you can't keep that thirty-five thousand...If you want to keep all that money, give it to your wife.

Coinbase above all others is getting tons of publicity, they are listed in almost every article on yahoo finance and others. Im thinking someone made a deal somewhere to create legitimacy and then sell or merge with a bigger more traditional trading house. I can see TDA picking them up. At any rate they are the standout for new Cryptvestors

Ouch, i would set a drop dead point based on a support line and if it crosses that sell. Somewhere around 20 - 25% of your original investment. Then scale back into the investment overtime instead of all at once. Risk aversion is key maybe diversify over several again to spread the risk, think in terms of percentages for your yields. If you make 30 - 50% on your investment u arent rich but live to invest another day with some jingle in your pocket and mitigate the risk of this highly volatile batshit crazy market. Stop thinking about the moon and just try making small progress one step at a time, it will save your sanity. Just my 2 cents

Diversify your funds 50% of 1000 bucks is still 500 dollars regardless. Don't put all your money in one investment. If u made money on bitcoin take out your original investment and buy yourself something perhaps litecoin or a new car or an xbox. Be smart!

Anything is possible but investing is about mitigating risk, in this case I do see what u are saying in terms of riskvsreward however how different is that strategy than playing the lotto? I just dont want good people losing money to poor trading strategy, ultimately its your money invest how u see fit. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:29:33
I understand what you are saying and u bring up something to consider but I dont believe it is as difficult as it may sound. It is harder to make a stock go up then it is to make it go down and I believe this rise in bitcoin on the eve (6 months in the making)  of CBOE and CME futures release has put it on my pump and dump radar. You dont feel that way? Hasn't struck you as strange? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:58:02
You dont understand, once an event occurs and an investment vehicle starts cascading downward whales wait until it bottoms out or a reasonable bottom where value exceeds risk. What I said was simply food for thought not a prediction. Argue for it or against it but risk mitigation is a must even for the staunch supporters. Good Luck!

Best advice is have a convo with him, tell him your concerns and and vision on how you would like to see this work moving forward. Check his response and if you feel its a good fit then move forward. At the same time interview other local accountants and  cross reference responses until you have a square peg for your square hole

Of course we know from experience that at least the IRS only takes a portion of your money. Still a great scene

Bitcoin will have a larger chance at being considered a currency when you can earn it outside of mining. Right now its just a commodity, not a bad thing since the yields have been stellar.

Whale and his buddys invest and buy 1000s of bitcoins for weeks artificially driving up the price. Futures market hits and they keep driving to build confidence. They short on futures wait for the right moment and pull the rug out. Cascading stop losses activate causing an unprecedented crash and they collect on both sides. Is this possible? My money is diversified as I want to believe but I must play protect at same time.

Awesome job, now whatever u were paying in student loans even if they were deferred atm can be considered a revenue stream. Take that amount however big or small and diversify it into different crypto or traditional equities monthly. Start with a percentage say 10% per investment until exhausted of that doesnt pencil out due to fees bump it up until it does and use that as standard. Good Luck!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:06:34
Keep in mind there is no circuit breaker, once the sell orders are triggered the price will plummet until the buy orders kick in hard enuff to stabilize the price. Thats what we saw today, most of those sells were preset stop losses, then the bargain hunters kicked in as well as buy backs...people making serious cheese wit dis.

Get a group of friends or family to invest with u monthly, each gets a stake in the bitcoin equivalent to their contribution. Share the fees and distribute the risk, this strategy will get you in the game with less fees and something to talk about at the dinner table.

How did u lose your money? BTC has been climbing for months, im missing something here. What did u buy in at? Ive been punched in the face, speaking from experience you got to come up swinging and leave this world the same way u came into it, kicking and screaming and covered in someone elses blood. Hold your chin up tell your wife and keep fkn punching.
