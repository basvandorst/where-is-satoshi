Thanks reddit friend for sharing my link. There's some good bits in there for people looking to check out what BlockFi has to offer. I'd definitely say overall I've had a positive experience with BlockFi, but they have plenty of room for improvement.
When people ask why they should trust a company like BlockFi, I think my general response is, if you've ever trusted any crypto exchange in the past, it really is no different. Yes there's always risks associated with placing your crypto in someone else's hands and every one should perform their own risk assessment and decide what they are comfortable with.
This being an unregulated space, many people have parked their funds on polo, bitfinex, binance, etc. and there's really no saying what they are doing with our funds behind the scenes. More than likely, they are running fractional reserves as all banks do to create additional revenue streams...and if you're going to trust any platform and you'd like to earn interest in the process why wouldn't you trust a company like BlockFi that has large institutional backing from Coinbase, Consensys, Fidelity, Galaxy Digital, and Morgan Creek; uses trusted and licensed custodial services like Gemini; who also happen to operate above board under provisions like Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as they do. I think there definitely are people who are interested in services like BlockFi and there are people who are completely opposed to the idea - and I completely understand their position.
I just personally like the idea of earning interest on my crypto since I'm in it for the long-haul. And at least for myself, I've done my own due diligence and am happy with my experience so far.

I agree people considering lending their coins should be mindful of the risks involved and only invest what they can afford. 
And for some like yourself, it's not the right fit, and that's fine too - you're stance is the most secure one at the end of the day ;)
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:43:00
It sounds like you maybe more interested in DeFi lending platforms like compound or dharma which is all smart contract based.
If you do decide to tryout blockfi [this guide]( will give you step-by-step instructions on the process and [this is one for Celsius](
I hope you manage to find a service that fits your needs!

I decided to compile some of my thoughts into this article after my experience with BlockFi. I think they have a solid product, but there are certain issues people should be aware of. I do hope in the coming months as they improve their product, they will consider lowering withdraw fees (but this may be a custodian issue) and losing the early withdrawal penalty which seems a bit excessive.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:00:40
Keep in mind for US residents, you will receive a 1099 at the end of the year from BlockFi that will compile your USD earnings from your interest earned. They do all the heavy lifting for you. So it's fairly straight forward, really no different than holding stocks and receiving a 1099 through Fidelity or similar brokerage.
@_date: 2019-07-20 09:28:16
When you talk about risk, it’s important to keep in mind that all these platforms over-collateralize  their loans to lower the risk to lenders and prevent loss of lent funds. 
And for many, aside from the institutions borrowing funds to short the market etc, many crypto enthusiasts (especially the rich ones) prefer to put up their crypto for a usd loan so they don’t lose their crypto position (so they don’t miss out on future gains) while also avoiding capital gains tax if you had simply cashed out. There is definitely a lot of upside on both sides.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:27:42
It's a step by step guide on how to setup an account on Blockfi - it tells you what information you need to provide and potential hiccups. It's informative for anyone who's considering using their service. I would've used a guide like this when I signed up, but it didn't exist. 
I'll also be doing a pros and cons article later this week to keep people informed since there are caveats with their service compared to something like Celsius.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:39:05
When I say no different, I mean in terms of risk exposure. I find it funny when people question the legitimacy of a platform like BlockFi while they are willing to blindly trust an unregulated exchange. 
I wouldn't personally place Coinbase (I very consciously left them out of the list) in that category as they are beholden to a higher standard being based in the US and have to follow money transmission laws and corresponding regulations which restrict some (not all) of their activities. But there have been many occasions in the past where exchanges have made questionable decisions in their own best interest and not the user.
What is the safest thing for anyone to do? Hold onto your keys. There's no question about that.
@_date: 2019-07-06 15:13:45
Awesome. That’s great to hear. Here’s a few promo codes to get you started. You might wanna strategically place these deposits so you can get all $30 ~~$40~~  worth.
At account creation only: “1861129813” - $20 in BTC when you deposit $1000 within the first 5 days. Latter half ($10) will be released after 90 days of maintaining a balance of $1000 or more.
In-app (after sign up): ~~“FIREWORK” - $10 in BTC when you increase your wallet balance by $500 within 15 days.~~ “NEWHOME” - $10 in CEL when you increase your wallet balance by $500 within 90 days.

There is definitely a large demand for crypto lending. There is more institutional interest in the crypto space than ever before, so this really doesn’t surprise me. Not to mention DeFi lending platforms are booming. There are always traders looking to short the market, and I really don’t see there being any shortage of interest anytime soon...but I wouldn’t be surprised if rates come down at some point
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:22:53
I’ve consistently made the rates they list every week (changes depending on demand)...so anywhere from 2.5%~8% APR depending on the asset. It’s not much from week to week, but it’s better than sitting in a wallet collecting dust. 
No minimum or max balance, free deposits and withdrawals - it’s been consistently reliable.
It’s worked out well, only downside is the simple interest. Will need to consider other options in the long run as compounding interest makes more sense if you’re looking for exponential growth.
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:43:54
Dump, incoming!
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:16:59
Most definitely a scam! 
If you’re looking to passively gains sats, I would consider a service like Celsius network or blockfi which offer more realistic returns of 3-6.2% APR/APY and they have a legitimate business model of lending crypto to institutions and traders.
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:27:53
They do let you earn your crypto of choice with what they call payment flex now, I haven't tried it but you can take advantage of their 8.6% GUSD interest rates and opt to earn all your interest in BTC as an alternate way to stack sats. In terms of keeping their conversion rates etc honest, that might be a little trickier (as in you'd just have to trust that they deposit the correct amount).
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:52:57
@_date: 2019-08-18 08:22:18
I've been using their service and have had a positive experience so far.
They have major players like Coinbase Ventures, Winklevoss, Fidelity etc as investors so if you're wondering if they're just going to disappear with your money overnight that's highly unlikely. Not to mention the fact they are registered and regulated in the US. 
As far as security, nothing beats your own cold storage, but BlockFi's custodial is Gemini which is very reputable and use their own security protocols that are very robust including insurance for their hot wallet. You can see what they offer in terms of security here: [Link](
It's also worth listening to the podcast with Zac Prince (CEO) where he touches on "worst case scenario" making a promise to make depositors whole before anyone else. Again, nothing like this is in their ToS but it is an enlightening interview regardless.
[ 
I've mentioned this in other postings but the 2 caveats with them currently is they charge higher withdrawal fees and an early withdrawal penalty when you withdraw before the end of the month (more details in the link below). 
As long as you keep that in mind and invest wisely, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
Here are my additional thoughts on Blockfi: [Pros &amp; Cons](

@_date: 2019-08-09 05:43:31
I've had a positive experience with them so far, but they have a lot of room for improvement. The biggest issues I have are their high withdraw fees (0.0025 BTC and 0.0015 ETH) and early withdrawal penalty (if you withdraw before the last calendar day of the month, you will lose all the interest earned on the amount withdrawn). So it takes some planning to make sure you don't fall prey to these policies. Here's some other things to keep in mind: [link](
[Celsius Network]( remains the most user friendly option, it's just unfortunate they don't offer compounding interest.
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:48:52
You do need to order the card to stake and earn with them right?
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:43:48
Same, have had a positive experience overall. Have been vocal about various changes I wanted to see and Zac and BlockFi twitter reached out to me. Before I knew it they had removed minimum balance requirements and gave us one free withdrawal a month (not ideal but better than nothing) fees were too high in my opinion and discouraged potential users from testing out the platform.
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:55:49
That's actually really nice they just let you withdraw your money immediately. A lot of promos they usually make you wait before you can run. I've had a positive experience so far, but making a quick buck sounds like a smart move too!
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:32:02
I've made withdrawals and had no issues. They've also simplified the process so there's no phone call required like before.
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:54:32
Where else do you spread your bits? Celsius, [Crypto.com]( Nexo, maybe some fo the Defi platforms? I wish there were a few more options as Celsius and BlockFi are the only lending platforms that I currently trust.
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:49:50
Haven’t heard of ledn.io. But their B2X sounds ridiculous. They pay 3.6% apy in btc interest but you have the option to double your btc by taking out a loan which charges 3% in fees? Something doesn’t add up. You haven’t even considered Celsius? Or something then you off about them?
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:31:15
I've personally had positive experiences using blockfi and am happy stacking sats for simply HODLing.
Blockfi currently offers the best APY on BTC at 6.2%. They offer compounding interest which is very attractive, but charge higher withdrawal fees and an early withdrawal penalty when you withdraw before the end of the month (more details in the link below). As long as you keep those 2 issues in mind and invest wisely, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

@_date: 2019-06-23 04:51:24
Have you looked at Celsius?
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:45:58
considering there are many HODLers who keep their coins on an exchange to no gain of their own, it's a viable option for those that want to stack sats while HODLing. they offer immediate withdrawals if you do need to selloff your coins in a bull market and there are no fees for withdrawals or opening an account. but i understand the peace of mind that comes with holding your own keys!
@_date: 2019-10-14 08:52:21
No FDIC. No crypto exchange or lending service has such a thing aside from basic insurance on stored funds similar to what Gemini (their custodial) has. They hold lending licenses in 47 states and operate above board under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. You can read more here [LINK]( where they talk about how your collateral is secured and communicated to the state you reside in case of a bankruptcy.
Gemini offers insurance on their hot wallet, not cold wallet. But they do provide specs on their cold wallet security which is very robust [LINK](
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:24:44
That's unfortunate they charged a deposit fee...that seems just excessive. That being said, BlockFi has changed their requirements and no longer have a minimum balance requirement to earn, no deposit fee and also offer a single free withdraw a month which makes it ideal for people looking to test out the service. I've personally had a positive experience but considering what happened with whalelend, I can understand your apprehension as well. Here's some other observations I've made: [LINK](
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:32:39
Aside from what I mentioned above (definitely check out the podcast), I would look at the [team]( involved in the project which can be found on their website. They also have a list of [advisors]( and their respective Linkedin profiles and twitter accounts. Many have experience in the finance sector (CEO Zac Prince has a number of years working specifically in the lending industry with various businesses) which should give you a certain level confidence in what they are doing. You can also check their [investors]( on their other page which should give you a sense of the companies that are backing and willingly attaching their name to blockfi.
That'll hopefully give you some information to assess whether you're comfortable with this sort of investment or not. You can also put in the minimum amount for a month and see if you like their service (just take into account their withdrawal fee if you do). But make sure you read up on their service see if it's worth your while.
Hope that helps!
**EDIT:** Forgot to mention [Coinbase Ventures]( [Fidelity]( and [Consensys]( are investors.
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:39:46
The interest rates do fluctuate. But it's dependent on market demand. rates started off at 6.2% then they cut ETH rates to 3.25% but now it's back up to 4.1%. Of course the balance cap has been fluctuating as well. BTC was 25 BTC then 10 and now 5 BTC for the 6.2% rate (anything over that is 2.2%) and ETH is at 200 at the moment. Some rate consistency would've been nice. But they also make it clear they can change the rates at will. Here are some Pros and Cons to keep in mind: [LINK](
@_date: 2019-10-13 06:14:41
It'll be interesting to see what Celsius does 5 years from now when we're all still earning interest on our initial deposit and have all this inaccessible interest lying around. You can't withdraw it and you can't earn interest on it...hopefully they will address the compounding interest issue sooner than later.
@_date: 2019-10-13 05:47:25
They've gotten rid of minimum balance requirements to earn interest and also now provide one free withdrawal a month (better than nothing, the withdraw fees are higher than I'd like) so it might be worthwhile just placing a some chunk change in to see how you like it. They send you a monthly statement - pretty straightforward stuff. Otherwise they do require KYC etc, you can see their requirements here: [LINK](
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:53:17
Like I said, not for everyone. But I think it's a great option for those who want to passively stack sats WHILE gaining value during a bull run. Nothing wrong with that.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:08:55
now it's worth a little more...fingers crossed this upward trend continues! If it does, Blockfi might have issues filling the 6.2% promise like with the ETH.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:10:33
Yep, I was disappointed to find they lowered the interest rate. Another user mentioned they publicly stated it would be silly to release an advertised rate and then immediately go back on it and that is exactly what they ended up doing...a bit of a bad look if that is the case.
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:21:01
How's the blockfi experience been for you so far? Still chugging along?
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:12:27
Referral programs are very common in any industry. Uber/Lyft, Acorns and others do it all the time and is no different than blue apron offering $30 discounts on their product. It's a simple marketing strategy to attract new users to their platform and encourage users to deposit funds. This sort of marketing in it of itself is not an indication of whether a service is a scam - in my opinion.
Celsius is a lending platform that lends your funds to hedge funds, exchanges and institutional traders and they don't hide that fact. But I think it's important to note that loans are overcollateralized (as much as 150%) in an effort to mitigate risk. Then they simply pay users a portion of their profits from loan payments on a weekly basis. Are there risks, of course, it's not for everyone. But I've had a pleasant experience myself. They explain more about their interest rates here if you're curious: 
@_date: 2019-06-24 20:13:55
I have to say there’s a lack community engagement with blockfi which is unfortunate. Celsius is very community oriented, whereas Blockfi has more of a big bank feel. Also the withdrawal fee is a bit steep. I did the math and if you put in the minimum amount, 0.5 btc, after a month, you would end up with interest equal to the flat withdrawal fee they charge which i’m sure discourages many potential users.
What were your observations?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:20:00
part of the problem is having to declare your 'earnings' in unrealized gains (BTC/ETH lending interest creating monthly taxable events), then let's say the crypto market tanks as worst case scenario - you will still owe real world tax on the USD valuation of the interest earned during a bull market...fun!
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:05:48
Where did they state:


I haven't seen or heard about that til now. That is unfortunate if they really did say that publicly...I'm assuming they underestimated the demand for ETH but come on guys...
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:40:39
Basically doing what a bank does with our money except they share 80% of profit from loans with the lenders unlike the banks. It's a nice way to stack sats, I've had a pleasant experience but I know its not for everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:21:29
I think there always be a potential risk in these types of investments, it would be ridiculous to say there is no risk or that it's comparable to a savings account. That being said, if you're willing to make strategic investments, do your own homework, it can work in your favor.
I highly suggest checking out this podcast with the company's CEO Zac Prince: [

The service they provide is a proponent to bring major adoption to the general public - they make crypto easy to use and understand for the lay-person which is something that's very lacking in this space. 
Lending and loans aren't the only service they provide, they also have Celpay which allows for free transfers of coins to other users and making transactions painless for many - it's a multi-purpose crypto wallet really. More to come as they grow!
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:07:21
They are much more community minded as well. Their rates, at least currently, are comparable to blockfi...minus the compounding interest. But they are much more flexible in terms of fee-less withdrawals and withdrawal times (immediate for under 20). Have you used their service?
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:46:37
They lend your cryptos for loans to individuals and institutions, that's their business model. Loans are overcollateralized and they share the loan profits with lenders (us). Their business model is what banks do with our money except we get a bigger share of the pie. Are there risks? Sure, they're not FDIC insured but no exchange is either and we seem to trust them all the same, but a scam this is not.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:42:26
I've had a good experience with them personally. You can test out their service with a small amount of funds (literally a couple of bucks if you want) since there's no minimum or maximum deposit cap. Plus it's all fee-less including withdrawals. The CEO  Alex Mashinsky is a well respected serial entrepreneur and tech innovator (inventor of VOIP) [check out this forbes write-up about him](

I decided to put some thoughts together after my experience using [Crypto.com]( I also was looking for a similar breakdown before joining the platform myself, so thought it might be helpful.
I think they have a great product, one of the best app UXs I've had the pleasure of using that trumps the competition (like Celsius). The In-App Support feature is also unrivaled, and blows me away that you can speak to a live-human in app within minutes. The Cashback on the debit card is a nice feature, and tho, I'd personally prefer receiving cash or btc directly as opposed to MCO, it is a great way to increase your exposure passively as you go about your day especially if you believe [Crypto.com]( and their future.
As far as an all in one ecosystem goes, they've largely succeeded in creating a seamless user experience and having industry-leading interest rates in their Earn program doesn't hurt. 12% on stablecoins is unheard of (with MCO staking) and I can't imagine it will last for much longer. Kris has also mentioned developing Defi solutions for many of their products that would allow users to retain keys to their crypto which would be a fantastic step forward and could be a turning point if it does come to fruition for many other platforms to follow suit.
The MCO staking requirements for various services, especially the Debit Card maybe a hard pill to swallow for more casual users who aren't as crypto inclined (minor speed bump to adoption - and yes I know the free midnight blue is an option). I think the idea of putting a couple hundred dollars on the line with a largely unknown company like [Crypto.com]( in comparison with applying for a checking account/debit card at a globally recognized bank maybe a hard-sell for the masses at this stage (too early), but in due time, if [Crypto.com]( continues its domination, I'm sure their reputation will grow with it. I do hope they become more transparent with their platform performance and figures, but we'll see if they ever do.
Kris has mentioned they will be fully profitable by 2020, which is good news as many were curious how they were able to afford many of the perks they provide their users - again, no figures to backup the claim so we'll have to take his word for it.
The addition of the native currency CRO in addition to the original MCO mucks up the waters a bit for me and has been a divisive topic for many early adopters. I don't personally see why it was necessary to create a new coin as opposed adding new features to MCO's token utility and developing both coins in tandem seems like a monumental task - hopefully the team is up for the challenge.
But all in all a solid product that is bringing the heat to legacy banking (albeit piggybacking on Visa's infrastructure and reach ironically) - I hope to continue seeing improvements with their products in the months to come.
If mass adoption is to become a reality, this is how it happens.
