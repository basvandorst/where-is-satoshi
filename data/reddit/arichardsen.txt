It will for sure go lower, and higher and lower

That's how they earn money.

Did you make the account just for this post? Get outta here!

You need to mine an alt coin with the gpu. And with the current prices you will probably lose money if you dont have free electricity.
Check whattomine for more info. 1070ti is better than 1080 for mining.

Tried localbitcoins?
Edit: And Bisq might be an option.

If you have to ask...

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes

Hopefully you'll get everything sorted out.
btw It doesn't exist any safe exchanges, there will always be a risk of hacking, sloppy fingers and so on.
Not your private keys, not your coins.

If you have to ask, it's almost definitely a scam..

Your fee is set to low most likely

He has a high paying Job. Let him buy high and sell low when the "chrash" comes.

All cloud mining is a scam, period. Why would anyone give you money when they can take the money themselves?
Buy crypto on a exchange, but do your research first.
@_date: 2019-09-20 08:30:14
You didn't research shit before you started. Rule no. 1,do not borrow money for speculation. Rule no. 2, don't bet more than you can lose.
These apply to all kinds of gambling, speculation and investments.
Also, good luck never touching crypto again.

I can tell you, but you shuldn't trust a stranger on the internet (you lost your money last time you did, remember?)  
Take your time and do your own reasearch.
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:09:12
No. The money is lost.

Afaik there are quite big differences on the ti and non-ti version of 1080 when it comes to mining.
