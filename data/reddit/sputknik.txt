Great job again WBN! Best bitcoin videos.

Hmmmmm. That is a better question, and requires a much higher level of coding knowledge. I do some programming, and it is the first thing in this thread that scares me.

I think the video says one to two dollars a day. Much more modest proposal. Tentative baby steps create revolutions. Nothing happens overnight.

"The Employee" is surely in Ross Ulbricht's Google Plus. No way he'd trust someone else. Someone he didn't know. You can't just hire a temp.

So the first one was Western Union? And now unbanked?

And remember it would a much bigger market if the fees weren't so high! Probably much closer to a trillion or more. Remove western union replace it with bitcoin and blammo...

Orson Welles got progressively more pathetic. Sadly.

Its true there may be no other area where it bitcoin stands out as well.

Great video. Thanks. One of the best Gold/Bitcoin comparison's I've seen.

much needed ammo for the heated discussions with the blind.

but there is a big naming problem. Having bitcoin be the name for the full protocol and the main unit is terrible. But it makes it even worse to consider that as bitcoin's rise in price, we'll be dealing with nanos and picos and millis and micros, just because we couldn't come up with good names. No company would make this mistake, this is a problem with a community...fear of being fresh.
