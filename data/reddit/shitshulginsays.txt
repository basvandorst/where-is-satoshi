More like building your entire economy on on a energy resource subject to potential sudden fluctuations of value at its best.

I didn't even think about how the blackout could be affecting their access to the Bitcoin network. I hope Venezuelans find some semblance of normalcy soon.

I actually LOL'd. Take my upvote.

My mom manages to find the most terrible, obscure B-movies and thinks they're watchable. She's gonna love this.

Poster by Larry Dunst and Steve Horn published anonymously by the Committee to Unsell the War, in a  multi-media-donated campaign of 1971 protesting against US military  involvement in Indo-China. 'Uncle Sam' was in reality Samuel Wilson, a  provisions merchant from Troy, New York, who supplied the US army during  the War of 1812 against the British. Through a series of connections he  came to be identified with the plain, honest, self-reliant and  patriotic American. In 1961 he was formally acknowledged by the US  Senate as the progenitor of America's national symbol of Uncle Sam. As  the personification of the USA he was invoked in a US recruiting poster  designed by James Montgomery Flagg for the First World War in 1917;   that image became iconic. This reinterpretation works through the ironic  reversal of the original gestures. The original image, with an  authoritative pointing gesture, summoning the viewer to enlist, is now  inverted as Uncle Sam is turned into a wounded soldier, pleading to be  released.

I like Buffet too but he doesn't understand Bitcoin and openly disparages it.

speculation should never confused with hope. those brits are fucked theyre gonna need something.
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:30:36
And this has what to do with Bitcoin?

Until someone cuts your finger off.
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:36:10
Or someone kills you and cuts your finger off.  Just using a password seems more secure.
@_date: 2019-04-14 00:32:32
For the same reason people reuse passwords: a combination of laziness and convenience. Also, as mentioned, they're probably exchange wallets.

 is a parody account. Seriously, all the people trying to attack her and the green new deal need to try a lot harder. Why is that \*too\* difficult? SMH

Cool idea and nice execution!
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:55:34
I figured that would happen. This sub is very opinionated. You know what they say about opinions...

Kraken or Coinbase are the easiest on ramps for most new folks in this space. I'd go with Kraken.
