it sends the btc or eth straight to your wallet so there is no extra "sending fee" to get the money onto an exchange.

ah well im from US so this helped me out a lot... ide be willing to pay more for the services of coinmama anyway, fast transaction and high limits. coinbase had me at 300usd limit on credit cards LOL and that was the only fast way of recieving.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:19:48
ehh theres a really good list here  but i would say definitely check out

i was stuck with coinbase with a $300 maxbitcoin buying limit and my bank account buying limit was higher but it took 7-10 business days to recieve my btc when i bought with bank -_- thank god i came accross this blog  that showed me a super fast way of getting btc with credit card and high limits... thank god this same site convinced me to use binance too  or else i was stuck using kraken LMFAO

@_date: 2018-06-10 07:09:53
wow thats messed up, theyre probably using your btc to make profit for themselves. they probably dumped it while the market was high and now theyre trying to crash prices even more so they can afford to pay people back
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:16:02
thats a pretty negative assumption lol. you obviously have no idea what your talking about.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:44:09
