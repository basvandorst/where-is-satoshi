Because there is nothing in point A (forking to 2MB) that's causing us to fork to point B (10MB) etc. It simply doesn't follow. Debt without a plan to curb it incurs more debt to pay off the initial debt. This is not one of these cases because there exists an equilibrium somewhere on this slope where there is "enough decentralization" and "enough speed/cheap enough fees". Arguably this "enough" is different for everyone and it's a hard coordination problem to conclude which point the market prefers. That's why I used the world fallacy.

Yeah, my comment is still true as of today.

It does, yes but it's a gain in speed/price that comes with a negligible sacrifice with regards to centralization/security and it's up to to the relevant scientists to figure out when that sacrifice becomes substantial. It surely doesn't seem it's at 2 MB to my uneducated eyes (metrics of storage cost I've seen around sugget it should not be prohibitive for average Joe to run a full node). Obviously it can't continue ad infinitum without another scaling solution like sharding but that's still very deep into research territory. What I dislike most personally is the rigidity and the holy status of the ineffable chain around here that doom it to be forever stagnant or extremely slow moving. That's why I prefer the Ethereum approach with such nascent technologies (referring to the Frontier--&gt;Homestead--&gt;Metropolis---&gt;Serenity(?) hard forks).

The actual message is 50% slippery slope fallacy(omg what's next 1TB blocks?!??!), as if the current limit strikes the perfect balance, and 50% virtue signaling (positive technology vs egotistical opponents).
Nothing to see here. No math, no metrics, no substance.

It's relevant as in: OP's account is one of the most obvious kinds of sock puppets that can exist... Keep on tooting your horns people, just don't assume new identities.

Ether has even better scaling already by both throughput and decentralization metrics.

Yeah, let's all congratulate a 0 days account... Somehow I believe he might not be "brand new" at this. The propaganda here has reached an ATH along with the price.
