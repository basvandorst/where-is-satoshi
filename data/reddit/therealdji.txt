Ok, so one would say that miner computer power has gone up, more block mined, so more transactions processed, competition to access block going down, so are the fees.
But difficulty will adjust, so that explanation can be only be valid for short term.

One side : an ambitious open source project.
Other side : copy/paste some other's work, make it private, then pushing huge amount of money to make it appears to the general public to be the original one, then 'profit'.
Then you come seeing to equivalent "sides" ....

Hi, Swiss here.


Some small roads (the last 50m connecting to your house, or lost in mountains connecting to farms only used in summer, that can be 1 or 2 km) are private. The vast majority of other roads, are public.


20% of the swiss population is foreign. Counting who is "white" or not, would be actually illegal.


We have very strict gun controls. There is a number of weapons  but you can't use them ou hold amunition in the same place. We will vote in less than a month to make more tight. Try to show a single gun in public, you'll get most people who seing it calling the police and  you will promptly get arrested by a SWAT like police team.
PS: How the heck would you come with such weird/dumb questions without first looking for actual information on wikipedia or something ?
