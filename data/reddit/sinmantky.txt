It's not wrong as in it will be expensive, because the mining will get harder and will require more electricity to get the block reward. 
Now, the understatement is whether the energy to run it will be as costly in the future. Recyclable energy is booming and ASICs are getting more powerful at a cheaper cost (i think). So $5 billion could be an over-estimate, could be an under-estimate.

US won't ban mining operations as it's not a dictatorship. The industry is too invested to back out.
And the second half of the sentence is not making sense.
