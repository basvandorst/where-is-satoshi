ETH is faster and cheaper to use. It also needs GPUs to mine it so ASIC miners won't affect it.

I'm not disagreeing with your comment at all.
I am saying this towards other people who say "one day bitcoin will be worth nothing" which is impossible as there will be collectors who will want it since the supply is limited to 21 million. I would rather collect cryptocurrencies than baseball cards.

I don't believe Bitcoin will ever reach 10 dollars.
I will buy 50,000 worth if that happens and get 5000 of the whole 21000000 supply.
People will collect them and then the value will go up again. Look at Zimbabwe when the 100 trillion dollar bill came out and was worth 40 cents (almost nothing).
Now it is worth 100 dollars on ebay and isnt even in circulation anymore.

The 100T Zimbabwe is actually 50-100 USD each.  the cheap ones you see are novelty gift notes and the legit bills are actually becoming collectors items.

hasn't gotten one confirmation yet in about 7 hours.
That is my concern.

I have sent BTC before to the exchange (it is my canadian exchange so its not a phishing issue).
You're right tho some people have been scammed from phishing sites before (with this exchange too)
My exchange also shows the pending deposit so I know its not phishing. Probably have to wait it out like others have mentioned because my wallet sent a fee that was too low.

I know this is a longshot but if you have any BTC you're giving away I'd love to have some.
I and a few others have lost money at mtgox and following after in Nicehash too so anything helps.

Yep my COINOMI wallet has segwit enabled and I'm pretty sure the receiving address has it enabled also.
Has it been having issues lately? Havent had this issue before but realized to fee was so tiny when COINOMI already sent it (coinomi is set to automatically choose the fee based on the network)

I sent some BTC last night:

first time it's ever sat unconfirmed like that. I know in 2 weeks I'll probably get it back if miners don't mine it but is there a way to speed up the transaction at all?

Well he is kinda right that gold did store value for thousands of years vs having a bunch of cash.
Only other thing that does this is land.
The issue is it is not longer currency so converting it back to fiat is actually more troublesome than crypto which can be done online pretty easily.
