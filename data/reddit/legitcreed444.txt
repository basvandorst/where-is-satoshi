Dude... look at what you just said “the government can always print more money” that’s the problem... inflation.  The u.s government fiat isn’t even backed by gold anymore its back by the trust in the government to pay back their debts. Bitcoin is clearly a currency. “Nobody knows the value of orange juice tomorrow” if I go to the grocery store today and tomorrow the orange juice will be the same price. So I guess I’m nobody?

“End of the worlds economy” go back in history it’s happened before new systems just come into play. There use to be no form of government fiat.

Lol have fun with mass chaos and some wars if you think it will go well if the dollar becomes worthless.

10% a year is still crazy gains... and yes a company with a safety rating of 1 is clearly going to be safer. If someone gave me 100k to invest I’d put 85% in stocks and 15% in crypto.

Ok I hope someone pays you in your least favorite cryptocurrency from now on

That’s like thinking a Macy’s card or whatever store card is threatening to bitcoin. It’s a ludicrous thought. In my opinion there is nothing special about this credit card yet people will still buy it because Apple made it. 2% cash back everyday sounds good until one realizes 1.that it is not a lot of money and may cause one to spend more because of this daily cash back 2. I highly doubt this 2% everyday will last more than a year and Apple will eventually change this 3. In terms of credit cards I feel as though their are a myriad amounts of cards that fair better than this one.

I don’t understand how people can post stuff like this with zero evidence. A random tweet on twitter does not mean anything. Stuff like this is actually going to hurt bitcoin not help it. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:10:49
What I wouldn’t go through all that haste because someone tried to force their agenda into me. If bitcoin is to grow popular acceptance must also come along with it.

This would be obnoxious for me if I was a worker who had no clue what or how to access my tip. Not trying to be negative.

Once again posts like these do no good. Why does it matter if a bank gets fined and how does this help with bitcoin. Banks can get fined or a myriad of reasons (Im not saying all banks are good or evil, trust me that’s a topic for another time and it usually falls to the latter for the two) but seriously even if everyone used bitcoin the banks would still do this stuff and be fined, they’d simply pay in bitcoin.

Fiat is dead because of one bookstore in Malaysia has bitcoin at the top shelf?

Articles like these do more harm than good to bitcoin. So what one guy got lucky and guess a number? What makes him an expert on a target price 
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:58:43
How are these people gambling and not investing. Whether you bet on the price to go up or down you are still “gambling” just because you don’t agree with what someone does, does not mean what you do is “investing” and what they do is “gambling”

Everyone talks about the price of bitcoin going up and how it till take over other currencies yet it is constantly compared to the dollar.
