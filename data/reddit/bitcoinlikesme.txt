I don't think they are deceptive. I've been a user of their service for over 8 months now. Transacted tens of thousands worth of bitcoin and fiat. Never had a issue. Yes, they do want you to get verified and then extra verified if you use b-pay, but if you do bank transfer or cash deposit, they don't bother you at all.
They are not in this to take money and disappear. They are serious players in the bitcoin market. Just my 2 cents.

I think they hacked themselves to get out of the payments to users.

I am interested to get into this too. Sounds more and more like potential money (if the founder doesn't steal them!)

Www.igot.com is local exchange in Australia

Quick update folks.
Sold big chunk of my bitcoin collection to igot on friday and had my bank account loaded by them on monday. To be precise, sold 18.33 bitcoin and had cash sitting in my commonwealth bank account at 9 am monday.
They have passed my test now :)

I got around $587. Boy! Am I glad I sold then :). Thinking of buying some more now. Price seems just about right and sticking for a few days.

Its quite funny, but not so appropriate. Russians are some of the best hackers, but ALSO, the nicer bunch are some of the BEST developers hands down.

I think the restriction to withdraw exists on level 0 and level 1. I completed my purchase, so should be level 2 in next few days.

BPAY really sold it for me. I love the convenience of sending whatever amount I want, whenever I want from bpay and have my wallet loaded soon after. Igot certainly has a lot of work ahead but sure is refreshing to see competition locally in AU.

Its already $604.32 at igot.com.

I am not sure they are same people or not. But could be.
Seems very reputable.
I would try  if I were you (specially because you have a sick feeling about Coinjar).
Otherwise they're both legit.
igot.com is cheaper for sure. Their spread is not as greedy either (compared to Coinjar).

They can always refund the money if its fraud to where it came from and not lose the bitcoin too. On other hang if they let some scumbag get away with btc and end up refunding $$ to the victim, its double loss. I see this as pretty straight forward. Get on a video call and you're set. Way less effort than starting this thread and keeping up with all our answers ;)

They're just another bitcoin exchange. I think based out of Australia and operate in India as well.

Finally used igot.com after reading about it on and off here.
They accept BPAY in Australia, which is really interesting and hard to get (from what I understand).
Sent the BPAY yesterday, they credited my wallet with $ today. Bought Bitcoin and it was available instantly. Sent it to my offline wallet, it took 2 hours. Only 1% commission. Plus in Australia, with BPAY and Direct Debit starting soon, I don't see why I (or you) wouldn't use it! 
I have to say I am a fan.

igot.com is another great option. They do show Commbank logo on their site, but I do not think they have the account. I've used their BPAY so far and like it.

Since I am in Australia, it would be igot.com for me personally.
They have no upper limits and offers discount on deposits larger than $50k.
I've done $65000 worth of buying from them in one go. No problem there.

If you use credit card to pay b-pay, they will ask that.
From what I see above - Option 2 - is clearly just a video call without the need of JP etc. I would rather ask them what is the security for my private documents. How they protect it from theft. Having worked in Forex, I know kyc and aml is a bitch which everyone of these exchanges try to follow. Who wants Charlie Sherm 2?
@_date: 2014-03-13 08:32:11
I think every exchange has adopted the 'safe' way than sorry about MtGox fall. Charle Sherms' arrest and what not. Its rocky road ahead and the sooner these exchanges adapt to the general policy framework, the better.

I think igot has some pretty robust referral program too. They pay $5 per purchase. Check them out: 
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:53:58
Definitely   The only exchange in Australia.  Coin jar is more of a wallet. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:52:20
I deposited yesterday and bought today. No problem at all.
