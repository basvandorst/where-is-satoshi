He is from the philippines. 800$ might not be "just" 800$ to him.

This shit scares me. Now the big boys come to play. So many people on this sub think of themselfes as some kind of wolf of wallstreet because they made 5k on the easiest fucking investment ever. These people are not joking around, they loose and gain millions like peanuts. Get ready for a bumpy ride :O

So, a user without any (im guessing) trading-experience, starts to trade highly-volatile crypto-currencies and loses money. What exactly is this post about?
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:41:14

Also if you work on a mac Desktop: Get the App "Bitcoin Ticker" and stick it to your Infobar on Top.

$5350 right now, you could be right.
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:06:36
the value increases, not the bitcoins. its likely to be even less bitcoin per person. i mean, if 1 bitcoin is 10k, im fine with having just one or two.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:03:34
Why would everyone be in debt? If i was in debt right now, there would be no way i would be touching bitcoin.
