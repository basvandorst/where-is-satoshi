["If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again."](

There's definitely room for improvement in terms of user friendliness, for example; I tried to connect to several nodes and just kept getting "connection failed" over and over and I couldn't figure it out, I just kept trying other nodes until I got a connection. 
It took me a couple hours to get completely up and running (including download the TestNet) but I work in tech so using a computer is second nature to me.
Documentation on setting it up is straightforward, I posted a very good walk through in my original post. It's for MacOSX, but it's pretty much the same for Linux/Windows.
**Edit:** Basically, if you know your way around a computer and you can follow instructions in a walk through, you'll be fine setting it up.  
My intention was to experiment in setting up a lightning node so I could learn the process. I plan on setting up a dedicated bitcoin/lightning node very soon, maybe experiment on MainNet lightning to get an edge in the network

In the meantime, consolidate your inputs, move your Bitcoin into SegWit wallets

Apologies for the delayed reply, I assume you're running this on Windows.  
You need to install Node Package Manager (`npm`) on Windows - [here]( and [here](  
Then you need to open the directory you downloaded the repository in a PowerShell Terminal and run `npm install` to download the dependencies.  
It may be easier to install [Docker for Windows]( and follow the [Docker]( instructions.
Edit:  
Be sure to edit the `app/credentials.js` file so that the explorer can connect to your BTC Node.

[janoside/btc-rpc-explorer]( is pretty good.  
You can get a pretty awesome demo of it [here](
