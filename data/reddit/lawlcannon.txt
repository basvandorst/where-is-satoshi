I've always wondered, what is the difference if a company takes cash from you? Technically if the company wanted to evade taxes they could just not claim it no? It should be up to the merchant who accepts bitcoin to declare their income just like with cash

I agree, nice work

"In other words, the government is hoping the price of Bitcoin stays high for the Bit-fire sale to come once Ulbricht’s trial is over" - From a forbes article I just found.
It would appear they do care of the value.
They also say the following 
“This is kind of new to us,” 
“We will probably just liquidate them.”
Probably means there is consideration not to. Otherwise she would have said, we will just liquidate them.
Just a thought

I've been following your posts but noticed your site only allows for orders up to 10 pins. Can I put in an order for more than 10?

Back up for me now too.

It is possible it will just go to auction but do you think there is no possibility they will treat it for what it is, a currency bust? Maybe they have the keys but are acting as if they don't so no one knows they are adopting it? Just the crazy in me talking.

The "hoard" since it will make them a huge player in the market. Even still the market still needs to hold some value to auction them, otherwise no one would buy them. It would be counter productive for them to try and stop bitcoin at least before they liquidate.
