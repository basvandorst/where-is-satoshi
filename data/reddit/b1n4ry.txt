If you obtained these bitcoins legally, contact your bank first. They will walk you through the process of how to legally handle this large deposit by having you filling out all necessary paperwork.

Protip, writing checks are still low cost and reliable when direct deposit isn't available for formal money transferring. 
Just like stamps and paper mail, it will never be completely replaced by email because a lot of formal purposes still needs it. 
Also, I'm not American.

And you're a dumbass for not being able to identify a very obvious sarcastic post.

"save money without volatility"
Time for a reality check OP.
Besides, why the hell would you send salary using PayPal? If both of you are in the same country, you'd mail checks like all other legitimate businesses.

Sure... your "girlfriend"

Thanks for the news. It's too early to order a pizza right now so i'll place an order later tonight.

I didn't know that sub existed. Guess i'll be doing the same.

I have never been so happy to see a company getting raided ever in my life
@_date: 2014-05-02 02:27:32
Why don't you do it yourself?
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:10:30
I can't agree with you more. The entire sub is just a massive circlejerk for a bunch of 13 year olds and people with a stupid amount of optimism that also have no understanding of essentials of economics or investment.

Writing something in ToS doesn't override federal laws. Everything written in Paypal's ToS is completely legal compliant, no matter how you would view it otherwise.

Yeah I misunderstood the OP and I thought both parties were in the Philippines. Either way, using Paypal is just stupid for this kind of purposes in a lot of ways.  There are plenty of other low cost and safe ways to send money globally without needing to resort to Bitcoins,

Except everything said is correct. Instead of circlejerking, go pick up a book about macroeconomics instead. 
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:27:59
The kind of bullshit people in this sub are able to pull out of their asses is amazing. Keep up the brilliant work.

For serious amount of money and for a serious sale like this, stick to fiat. 
There will be way too much drama and headache when the price of Bitcoin flucuates and when you need to pay taxes or complete official documents on selling your house. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:51:31
Because Bitcoin totally will in the foreseeable future. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:10:09
Whatever makes you sleep better at night my friend. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:32:33
Thanks for proving my point. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 12:07:44
This picture literally summerizes this sub in a nutshell.
@_date: 2014-04-05 18:00:59
Good idea!  Because embezzelment and money laundering totally isn't possible with Bitcoin right? 
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:27:09
Because as a professional bitcoin shill, it's your obligation to explain it to literally everyone who doesn't give a shit about bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-27 23:39:13
I'm honestly not sure if you're trolling or not, but you do realize that's the symbol for Thai Baht right?
