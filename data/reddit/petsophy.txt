The sidebar links to the official bitcoin wiki which has a lot of crappy info on it that can only be edited by "Trusted users".  For just one example the "newbie guide to buying bitcoin" says the MtGox is the "most trusted" exchange.  No wonder people are still lining up for their ridiculous processing delays and inadequate trading engine.  It would be great if we could provide some alternative links that provide the more helpful sorts of answers regularly given here on reddit.  Maybe a definitive reddit thread that we could link the 20 new 'how do I get started?' threads/day to?

Speculative vehicles are always prone to manipulation - that is one more reason why we must develop the Bitcoin economy, so that its speculative aspect becomes less predominant over time.

Welcome!  0.05 btc is 50 millies, colloquially.  I agree it sounds better, and after the exchange rate stays in three digits for awhile it will sink in.

Bitfloor and Bitstamp would probably be the standard suggestions for the US and Europe respectively.
I personally like [CampBX](  They have all of the functionality you would expect a leading exchange to have, such as stop loss orders, fill or kill orders, and margin trading (pending greater volume).  Their volume is unfortunately super thin but since USD withdrawals are easier for Americans than at other exchanges it can tend to be a buyer's market.

Cash deposit to Bitfloor.  Register on their site for more details.
Edit: if you're in the US, that is.

Send it to a data retrieval service!  Worst case scenario it'll cost you around $3000.  If they can't retrieve anything you will have lost a couple hundred for the diagnostic fee.  Totally worth it.

She is trying to get women interested in Bitcoin, and he told her if she "wanted attention for being a girl" (which she didn't - her concern was *other* women) she should post in gonewild (which would be a strange approach since her concern was other *women*).  How the fuck dense do you have to be to not see in the title that she is not looking for attention from men?
likwidtek essentially said 'if the point is that you're a woman you should just do sexy pics'.  Well guess what asshole - being a woman is about more than posing for men.
Dear god, why are there so many retarded fratboys on this subreddit?

Sorry, buying btc is not instantaneous, but once you have them transacting within the btc economy is very close to instantaneous.  So buy a bunch, deal with processing delays one more time, then enjoy never having to deal with this kind of inconvenience ever again in your life!

If you go through AML-KYC verification with them (ie. send them your identity) those limits are removed.  In that respect no different than other exchanges.

There are many options but regardless there is no third party in charge of the btc ledger because it is stored in a p2p network!  You're being purposefully obtuse.  Go away.

Gox had 80% market share in 2011.  It's currently just over 60% and falling.  Anyone can see where this is going - switching exchanges is just staying ahead of the curve!

There is some truth to this.  Right now the Bitcoin subculture is very male dominated and I can see where some of this frat boy shit will drive women away before they even give it a chance.  But ideally there will be no Bitcoin subculture per se - as a medium of exchange it should by definition be able to bring vastly different people to the table even if they don't identify with each other at all.

You took the single most convoluted path to purchasing btc!  It hurts to see newcomers doing this.
1) Stay away from Gox.  They are not and will never be up to the task of being the leading bitcoin exchange.  Either they will fade away or we will hobble along under the power of the network effect until they have a catastrophic failure that scares everyone away.
2) Stay away from Dwolla.  Try a cash deposit to Bitfloor - easy!
3) No need to use the default client and download the blockchain.  Try a lightweight client like Electrum or an online service like blockchain.info, perhaps as way stations to more secure brain wallets or paper wallets.

PSA: a website like  is the place to do this.
If you sell to some random dude who hasn't built up credibility within a crowd-sourced rating framework, you could very easily get scammed, eg., if he pays you through paypal he has 45 days to file an "item not received" complaint and reverse the transaction, keeping the bitcoins.

Not sure the lag always correlates to selling.  More likely, some early adopters who are starting to diversify are set in their ways and haven't figured out that they could be getting better prices at newer exchanges.

You're not thinking this through.  No, you can't trust anonymous internet people - how do you know they're not running a scam?  That's why we need either corporate middle men (dollar) or cryptography (bitcoin).
When you spend bitcoins there is no middle man - that's the point!  But when you buy bitcoins you're spending dollars.  So there will be delays getting into the bitcoin economy.  After you're in your life will be simplified.

Stay away from Mt. Gox, they are incompetent.  If you're in Europe buy from Bitstamp, Canada, but from Virtex, US, buy from Campbx.  Or, if you're high net worth and buying alot, check out Tradehill.
