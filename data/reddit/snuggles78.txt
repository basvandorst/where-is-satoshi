I suspect that this is directly correlated with bitinstant being down.
Also if they ever get the LTC trading online there will be massive influx of traders moving coins around from the different brokers taking advantage of the spreads

Well im trying an order of 35. It's been 13 hours at least its a bit quicker than coinbase. Question, do you email users once the purchase has been completed?

These guys are pretty great 15 min turn around on a cc purchase through your google wallet. Have to get verified first and i think they only do that during business hours.

Thanks it finally completed. Just a suggestion, how about a little more info for completion times and the address of the bitcoin recipient. Right now the purchasing info is kinda vacant. I realize this is a work in progress just trying to help out. If you guys need help with the email/spam issue let me know I would love to help you out with your endeavour. I have several solutions you could use to cut down on this.

The spread on this site is way to big. About $70. over or under the current price its pretty sick. SO NOT WORTH IT Your better of with bitfinex.com which has a spread within $.01

Give these guys a try 
I was able to get coins through them in about 14 hours.
Coinbase is great for depositing back to your account, but purchasing takes 5 business days.
I miss bitinstant.
