I'm not sure these "you don't understand cars, internets, fiat" work are completely valid comparisons.  People natively understand the value in transportation and ~~porn~~playing computer games and avoiding trading sheep for shoes.   But it's another hurdle altogether convincing somebody that dollars are a bogus exponential curve of doom... and they should store their value in digital bits.

For those following along -- I have still yet to successfully buy bitcoins.
For good or bad, I do have a (verified) dwolla account now.  MtGox experience didn't go well (they too wanted extra scanning of documents and verification or whatever -- but it failed).
I did just try bitinstant... and while it nicely drained my dwolla account, the order status page says it failed, and I haven't seen funds magically show up in my wallet.
It does seem like once you HAVE bit coins, that transfering them around is probably relatively painless, but daaaaaamn.  Getting bitcoins -- I should have sacrificed a chicken or something (neighbors dog got 'em first).

It's true that I couldn't have imagined the iphone -- not even remotely -- back when I was droppin'  poke 53280, 7 on my commodore 64 to change the background color.  
But the hurdle of "nothing tangible but bits on a computer which gets hacked and crashes all the time" -- it's a heck of a hurdle, imo.

Yes, but I am easily confused :-P
The confusing part is it seems like reddit is basically "lending" me a wallet to use?   I see that I can send the coins from there to my personal wallet.

Well, I understand the benefits of a good password -  I mean, who doesn't love this comic?   
I was literally unclear on the relationship between the long passphrase used by electrum ... and my private keys.

Bitcoins are "stealable" too, no?  And easier to loose through a computer crash vs the gold/silver sitting in my safe.
Not sure how I missed Coinbase.  I did mention a steep and scary learning curve though :)

Heh.  I getz a smack for my smarty pants! :)
But I suspect you know what I am talking about.  It's hard enough getting my folks to understand if its okay to update Java on their machine... trying to get them to securely store their private keys would be a non-starter.
I mean, I am like 25 years into being a computer nerd and *I* can't tell you how the passphrase in electrum relates to my private keys.  
The one thing I have taken away from this thread is just... "we are on a longer time frame dude.  Chill.  This conversation will look silly in 10 years".   Totally possible.

I suspect that is true if you are already know what you are doing.  If you are new, its a ton of research, and waiting for clearances at banks, mtgox's, dwollas, whatever.   I probably should have asked if there were any seattle folks here, met in person and handed you some cash :)

woooo!  I finally haz some bitcoins!  :-P
@_date: 2013-02-02 22:17:18
Thanks much, my first ever bitcoins other than the "redeem karma" command to bitcointip. :)    Now, to figure out if I am supposed to have private keys for that address or what...

Help the n00b.  What/how/huh/wha?  How do you do that?
@_date: 2013-02-02 17:04:59
Noooowww you all tell me :)

3 times via the "Contact Us" (live agent) and 1 email.  Not a single response.  At day 5 the transaction magically went through -- and that was the extent of the communication.  Pretty bad.

I totally laughed at this.  Hell, once they understand it... there is a further hurdle to *believing* what you understand. :)
