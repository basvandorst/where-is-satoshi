I appreciate your response Roth. Unfortunately we haven't made a lot of headway with these scammers. Most likely they have gotten away with it. I appreciate your concern, and will let you know if there is anything you can do to help =)

Appreciate the effort, but they probably won't message you back.
To anyone reading this thread, Xtrememiners.net is almost definitely a scam.
1)No VAT number
2)No company registered to the street address they listed
3)Have tried calling their number numerous times and it has been shut off
4)Asked for a refund mere hours after placing the order, and they said my BTC had already been used to purchase parts for my order. I said they could just swap my order out for the next Tiger order placed and could still give me a refund. They still said no.
5) Furthermore, they had not responded to my messages for a refund for several days, but I sent them an e-mail from another e-mail address, asking about delivery times for Lions, and they responded within 2 hours. Go figure.
6) Finally, if you trace their IP address, it doesn't show in Frankfurt, Germany, but rather in Austin, TX, under a company called Network Solutions, LLC, with a completely different list of info, etc.
Xtrememiners.net is certainly a scam. I haven't heard back from them in days, and I definitely won't get my 10 BTC back. They're probably already closing up shop since bitcointalk and Reddit are both calling them a scam.
If anyone does do business with Xtrememiners.net I would suggest that you do as much research as you can, and report it to the FBI at:

They're all roughly around the South CO/North Texas Area.

Yeah, they told me no refund, and I've been messaging them quite a bit the past couple days, and no word. I think I'm totally screwed on this one bro :/

Thanks man, I appreciate the response. Although if I may ask, what is BFL?

Unfortunately I live in the U.S., however I have strong reason to believe that the company also operates out of the U.S. considering they fail to adhere to several EU/German trade protocols. (VAT# turned out to be fake, wrong invoice type, all IP addresses are based out of the U.S.).
I appreciate the helpful response though. I'll take any advice at this point.

I'm pretty sure I've found out where the "company" is located.
When doing an IP address lookup usually you'll get
216.185.152.159  
Which is the IP of the server hosting company they use; Hostway Services. In Austin, TX
You may also get another IP address that leads to New York, New York, the location of the wix.com server, that was used to create the website.
However, after doing a whois lookup, I've located what I think is the actual location of the scammers; Englewood, Colorado.
Found with the IP address 204.202.20.53

I'm desperately trying to get my 10BTC back, but they've all but disappeared on me.
At this point I really think the only thing that has a chance of getting our money back is reporting it to the FBI.

How long did it take them to get back in contact with you? I just asked for a refund last night and I haven't heard from them yet... 9.8 bitcoins...Kill me please.
Also if you could show the blockchain refund that would put me a little at ease.
