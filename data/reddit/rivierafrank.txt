well you could spam the mempool to raise transaction fees by gaming the automatic fee calculators in popular services/wallets.  Since fees are large % of blocks now, the cost of the attack could be very small compared to the reward.  Like some of bitmain,s pools or something that dont pay out transaction fees.

to counter that - tether is used because the exchanges dont have good relationships with real banks.  so the clients dont hold usd, they hold shitusd, tether on the exchange.  if tether is worth 10% of what it is now, then those that hold it will lose a lot.  but the exchanges ?  i dont see how they will lose.

well its not explicit I suppose.  But you cannot buy oil from venezuela " the purchase of any debt owed to the Government of Venezuela, including accounts receivable; "  That includes the oil company.  accounts receivable would be ordering oil and paying on delivery for example.  So you would have to pay in advance for oil from venezuela, not sure many would do so.  im just trying to see what effect the executive orders have in practice.

decade of under-investment in oil operations, from new drills to maintaining equipment are the by-product of political actions.  Those are placing people loyal to the regime in critical roles, but without any experience or will to manage the company properly.  Corruption at every level because of bad working conditions, replacement of good workers with bad workers (but loyal to the party).  Its a patronage system.  Over 10 years of this adds up.
But When Maduro says its the USA's fault, he is not wrong.  All of their problems are their own, but recently they have been shut out of the worlds financial and commodity markets.  Any institution dealing in US dollars cannot by law, anywhere in the world, deal with Venezuela.  This means no one can trade with them.  Any bank transfer that may use a US dollar must pass by a the US for large amounts of dollars, even if as an intermediary.  They cannot sell their oil for hard currency, and since their budget is entirely oil based revenue, they are dead in the water.  Hence hyper-inflation and commodity/medecine/anything imported shortages.  They have no hard currency (us dollar).
Their problems are their own making, but the people's misery is mostly due to US sanctions.  Iran be warned.

@_date: 2018-09-11 15:22:47
good analysis, I am wrong on that point.   I don't believe I am wrong on the bank transfer point though.  I dont think a bank can send US dollars to venezuela without having an intermediary inside the USA handling the transaction, unless the non-us bank has a direct relationship with the bank in venezuela for us dollar transfers.  Combined with the fact that they cannot increase oil output without borrowing money to buy equipment, parts, etc  (selling debt), I guess that means that yes you can buy oil from Venezuela, but as you said, there is no oil to buy.

devil is in the details:  In short you can buy its oil, but you cannot use any us dollars.  Vast majority of oil transactions are in US dollars, and vast majority of us dollar transactions regardless of the bank or destination pass by an intermediary in the US.  They can sell oil for foreign currency, with Cuba, Iran, North Korea, etc.  Technically they could sell oil to Canada for canadian dollars, but since pretty much all canadian institutions have operations in the USA, none would dare I think.  Same goes for big european banks.  They can sell to China for yuans.  But most of the stuff they import is in US dollars which is the problem.  So you are correct in your analysis but in practice the united states rule the world.
 the  term  ‘‘United  States  person’’  means  any  United  States  citizen,  
permanent  resident  alien,  entity  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United  
States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches 
of such entities), or any person within the United States; 
and 
(d)  the  term  ‘‘Government  of  Venezuela’’  means  the  Government  of  Ven-
ezuela,  any  political  subdivision,  agency,  or  instrumentality  thereof,  includ-
ing the Central Bank of Venezuela and Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), 
and  any  person  owned  or  controlled  by,  or  acting  for  or  on  behalf  of,  
the Government of Venezuela.

@_date: 2018-09-10 22:03:24
oh its just by default.  Since any large (well I suppose) us dollar transfer would imply using a usa based intermediary, even in bank to bank transactions, then it would be a violation of the order.  It bans dealing with the state owned company for oil - account receivables.  So I suppose if you delivered cash in person then it would work.
Well thats how I interpret this at least.

no.  Who controls the supply controls the price.  In a free market, prices are determined by supply and demand, according to the elasticity of each.  IF the supply is controlled, it can be manipulated to maintain a price level.  For example, if demand drops, then supply can automatically adjust to a lower equilibrium.  If demand goes higher, supply can adjust to a higher equilibrium.

People that are ignorant like to dismiss DogeCoin, and talk trash about it.
Its wrong.  Dogecoin sponsored a NASCAR car, a bobsleigh team, water projects, etc.  Dogecoin attracts do-gooders, not semi-libertarian "step on others to advance" mentality in other coins.
Dogecoin had a tipbot on reddit a long time ago that not only worked, but was widely used.  Dogecoin had a tipbot on *twitch* that was less used but it worked well.
So yeah, such wow much success, because people that found the meme coin funny and fun spent time making it better because it *was fun to do so*.

Share buybacks provide liquidity in the market so that insiders/large shareholders can sell without causing major price changes.
They are also terrible if you look at opportunity cost - unless there are no real growth opportunities in that business sector.  It is better to invest 1 billion to make many billions, than to buy back 1 billion shares.
Share buybacks are popular because in this low interest environment they can sell debt and use the money to buyback shares.  
I'd say there is no manipulation or anything *wrong* per se but it is very much a "now" vs "later" debate for the company shareholders.

@_date: 2014-01-29 16:42:53
you are right spot on for the drugs.
You will find there is a surprising amount of money in human trafficking.  The UN has good stats on that.
war money?  Think of blood diamonds, to say the least.  Other than that, all the stuff in your cellphone?  Congo.  Congo has been at war for the past what 20 years almost non stop.  
you are right, but in most cases the revenue that supports war is laundered through multinational corporations who 'clean' up the sources of income.
remember laundering money means taking an illegal source of income and making it a legal source of spending.
So there is war in this country.  I sell em weapons in exchange for raw materials for example.  Now i got some materials which i need to sell.  Since this is illegal (such things are indeed illegal), I have to launder the money I will get by selling it.  This laundered money can now be used in the legal economy.  
so in that way laundering money facilitates war.
OR, I am a gov official in a shit country.  We are building a power plant.  I choose the engineer co based on what bribe I get.  I must now launder the money so it becomes spendable.  Then I go to London and send my kids to a rich school.  money laundering facilitates all corruption.  
OR I run sheep road....steal everyone's coins.  I must now launder the coins to be able to spend them.  Or else I will be followed in the blockchain and arrested/killed.  
Irrelevant to charges against bit what not.  HSBC laundered billions for cartels and shit.  US banks FLOWN FROM MEXICO MANY PLANES FULL OF CASH IN 2008.  These are facilitators.  They get fines and slaps on the wrist.  Bad people use these greedy banks and people (who charge big fees to do so).

because it is an activity that is only useful if the funds in question are illicit, illegal or unethical.
you launder drug money, people trafficking money, war money, etc, etc, etc.
By laundering money, you facilitate the above.  
1.  drugs, prostitution, human misery needs money laundering.
2. it facilitates the above, more misery.
3.  It then goes in the legal economy, which distorts it and fucks up more people.  for example, italian mobsters run waste disposal schemes to launder money.
WHAT IS THE RESULT? RADIOACTIVE WASTE IN THE OCEANS IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF.

wow this tone vays guy.  just wow.  I love the analogy on the nuclear reactor in a town.  He says we should trust the nuclear engineers, and that ordinary people have no business running the plant.
What a fucking dumb fuck.  sorry for my language.  People in the town have their say, and through municipal and gov influence, they DO decide what happens and what doesnt.  THEY FUCKING LIVE THERE.  nuclear engineers run the plant, but they DO NOT take major decisions on global plant affairs.  BIG DIFFERENCE.

Well thats is true overall.  But everyone has a stupid agenda.  I cast my democratic vote to have an automatic fork when blocks = 95% full for x amount of blocks AND average fees are above a certain threshold, say 1$ equivalent in bitcoin.

lol the idiocy of encouraging more high frequency trading in the name of providing "liquidity".  The order book is more liquid, the order book's spread is narrower.  yes.  Of course.  Unfortunately, as in the real stock market, this means that trade lots over time tend to a board lot (say 100 shares) and visible liquidity tends to the minimum possible.  
Thus, for the real stock market, a buyer with a sizable trade suddenly finds out that after buying the few board lots on the ask, that there is no more liquidity, it has already moved further out, and also all other liquidity has been bought out by the same people.  So he has to buy higher.  
In conclusion, its not real liquidity, its not a real tight spread if you have good size.  It is encouraging a subset of people and pushing out another.  And when shit hits the fan suddenly, trust me on this, these people are nowhere to be found or they make the problem worse until the machines are turned off.

well, usually an ETF has a designated broker/dealer.  So for example that lucky bastard (usually a big bank), can redeem or subscribe in lots of 50 000 shares for example (this can change).  Effectively creating or destroying ETF shares.
So in short, if the fair value of the ETF is 5% higher than market, then they will buy the ETF, exchange the shares for either cash/the underlying (usually its cash).  At the same time, they will sell the underlying, and buy it back when they get the cash.  both transactions are well timed so they capture the 5% spread.  Quite profitable, arbitrage.
Normal people/hft can also do this, but simple buying selling and not redeeming/subscribing.  So in reality the fair value variation is quite low due to market efficiency/assholes who cut the spread.  hope this helps understand how that keep the prices in balance.  if they say they have 100 btc, but in reality they have 10, thats fraud and the SEC will be all over you, plus they audit all that shit independently usually.  when its public, its usually well checked.  I imagine for bitcoin they will check it more :)

Also multiple stages does not compute in a trip to the moon - multiple stages are needed to got to space.  Learn your DeltaV equations.  
To land and blast off FROM the moon takes relatively little power - no multiple stages needed.  Your space facts are all wrong.  Also, a big enough catapult could in theory work too to get to space, although the trajectory would be unwise.

I dont think so.  The reason is that the contracts have an INSANE capital requirement, so the cost of holding a futures contract is so prohibitive might as well buy bitcoin direct lol.  And if you want to hedge your portfolio, the cost of doing so is so prohibitive that its better to just sell some now and forget about it.

hahahahahah I just looked at the bitfinex chart....holy crap guys wtf are you doing...high leverage and stops...thats how you get fucked.  its not a very liquid market....I mean, in one instant of time, the market isnt very liquid, so a large order 100$ higher will trigger all the stops and margin calls, they then sell a large order 100$ lower than the initial price, and all stops and margin calls are again sent....easy as pie If you have a shitload of BTC laying around.

not really.  its not the same, hear me out.  An new gen asic provides huge increase of power/watts over the previous generation, rendering the last (or second last) generation virtually useless. With GPU's there is no such thing.  everyone is equal.  he has no huge market share of actual equipment production, has no influence and many other people have GPU's.  Or CPU's for that matter.  The problem with ASIC's is that people can literally only buy them from bitmain (sorta).

@_date: 2016-01-23 19:24:53
I kinda disagree. central banks do not do settlements, and do not actually emit money directly for the most part.  banks create money, and clearing houses settle trades on the markets.  a blockchain cannot replace a bank, because a blockchain does not fulfill the important function a bank has :  to create money.
money is created when a loan is made, and so most loans are to enable consumption or means of production/innovation, which creates growth and advances us as a civilization.  bitcoin can do no such thing.  Its value derives from its utility, which is to send and receive at very low cost and fast speed, from anywhere, to anywhere, anytime and on any platform.  thats its power.
But it will never replace money creation, or loan creation in society, because it has no such function.  block rewards do not count as they will end and that is not their purpose.  
Central banks wont be replaced by bitcoin, their main function is to regulate the cost of money, interest rates, and thus maintain a reasonable rate of loans vs the real economy, thus the rate of inflation.  Because we base our decisions on expectations of the future, a stable inflation rate is deemed optimal.
Bitcoin is no global monetary base.  It is a universal galactic currency.

As a merchant myself, cash is pretty much instant in your account, transaction is reversible, but that has never happened to me, and I eat up the cost of the transaction, about 3% which is high i must say, but im not charging more for it.

1.61$ per day = extreme poverty.
In fact, not offering them employment makes the whole society and themselves too better off.  They may be in immediate need of income (which the state can provide) but putting them in extreme poverty creates incredibly expensive externalities on the whole of society.  Just think of what extreme poverty means for a society and the repercussions.  On healthcare, opportunities, employment, education, etc.

oh I agree, but i'd argue this was a mostly financial crisis which spilled over everywhere.  There was no accountability for the bad bets and the systematic fraud *at all levels*.  From the mortgage lender who was paid per loan sold, from the investment bank who specifically engineered shitty CDO's so they could buy CDS' from AIG against it, to the rating agencies who were merely giving their "opinion" while getting paid per rating dollar, to the US government, treasury and Federal Reserve - dominated by the same people running the investment banks.  Yeah, it was fraud.  Some people made 10s of millions in bonuses *per year* (head of firms got 100-500million each for 2005-6-7) by booking all the profits from the derivative sales right away.  They did not pay anything back.
You call it a failure of capitalism.  I call it fraud, criminal behavior and I blame it on massive de-regulation and incentives to behave badly.  Right now its business as usual.  The only "problem" is that they took it too far because they can't control themselves.

Re: [PATCH] increase block size limit
October 04, 2010, 07:48:40 PM
	
 
It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

About the banks...QE bought securities at fictional prices at first.  Which is why AIG got "bailed out", which means its obligations were honored at 100 cents on the dollar.  It was the only way to avert massive losses that could not be recuperated.  Sure a lot of banks were in fine shape, but it doesnt really matter if there isnt a financial system to operate in.  In time prices came back up and losses were absorbed but the damage done is incredible.  The output gap that we now have from this is staggering.

@_date: 2017-01-22 16:23:28
well...no.  im not comparing it to anything.  its economic view is flawed, and proven wrong.  I think Greenspan makes a great example and he explains it beautifully with his own words.  how he viewed the world...turned out to be incorrect.  to believe in such an economic policy after 2008 is heresy in light of empirical evidence.  thus new ideas are needed.  improvement is needed.  collectivist ideas were proven also inadequate a half century ago.
edit:  im just saying its a fluctuating science.  for example, Friedman's legacy and work, is also flawed.  utilitarianism economics isnt perfect, and people have been trying to innovate with other things, economics based on physics, behavioral economics, etc.  for example friedman core belief of personal utility and reward drives individual actions, thus collective ones is flawed.  turns out people sometimes take decisions opposite of what should be done - thus some people started exploring irrational economics and such.  im not in the game really anymore, dont know the latest theories.  but the only thing i learned in economics is to apply critical thought and to always say : on one hand yes...but on the other...

no.  Has anyone read the freaking whitepaper of the coin.
You can pay gov services with BOLIVARES, which are pegged to "petro-coins".  Which is pegged to oil, etc.  Of course the real kicker is that there is an official exchange rate for petros to bolivares, and this can change too.
In no way shape or form you are obligated to use a petro "coin" to get gov services.

nope, sorry to break your bubble.  Now sure there is the classical economic problem of identifying the best performer for the next 10 years, be my guest.  hedge funds do have great returns, and also very great losses at some points.  then since they are underwater on their fee structure, they close and re-open under another name, and raise money again.  see talib for example.

It did work, I did it for a number of years, but at the end I felt it wasnt making enough money (because of lack of movement in the market) and I had a few spreads go haywire a bit.

lol its not a perfect hedge, but holding bitcoin is a hedge for a weaker economy.  do you know what ceteris paribus means.  i guess you need to study economics a bit, it means all else being equal.  so ceteris paribus bitcoin is a hedge for a weaker economy.  still havent commented on the s&amp;p hedge I mentioned.  is that not a hedge in your opinion ?  
How about this.  The canadian economy is weaker and the cad dollar is also weaker.  BTc price, in canadian dollars, is at an all time high or almost.  holding BTC has been a hedge !  I'm going in the USA soon from canada, and my cad money buys me 30% less stuff than before.  But my BTC is worth more in CAD.  Assume the usd price has stayed the same.  get it ?  it hedged my cad position.  (irrespective of the btc movements).
now why is this ?  because Bitcoin is priced mainly in USD dollars.  holding any other usd asset, would also be a hedge against a weakening cad dollar.  hedges can lose you money too - they aren't what you think they are.  For example, an oil company can sell oil futures ahead of time to lock in profits.  If the oil price goes higher, they lose a barrel load of money on their hedge.

our electricity is like 99% hydroelectric.  If you want to talk hydro, then Quebec is the place.  
This is click-bait.  There was never a "ban" on electricity (makes no sense anyway).  The issue is that the miners want a good price, but they create no value, no jobs, no infrastructure, nothing good for society - so they should pay market prices, not subsidized prices (like aluminum production).
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:16:04
hypothetical scenario.  a hedge isnt supposed to be "safe".  a hedge is something that negatively correlated or cointegrated to your asset.  moves up, hedge moves down.  etc.  Perfect hedge :  I buy s&amp;p500 futures.  to hedge, I buy inverse s&amp;p500 ETF for the same dollar amount.  althought the s&amp;p500 is not "safe", you are now hedge perfectly - any movement in price does not affect you.

@_date: 2016-12-03 22:55:51
with time, transaction numbers will increase, maybe exponentially with greater adoption.  (who knows).  so while yes fees would go down at first, more transactions would fill the blocks at which point fees will go up again, then we can increase the block size again, etc.  maybe we can say if the transaction fee is over 100/b for 30 days, then block size + 1mb.  I'm guessing total fees would look like a see-saw pattern going upwards on a chart.
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:20:44
lol @ bitfarms.  A bitfarm size farm probably needs 1 or 2 part time employees at best.  the rest of the employees of the business are normal business stuff, secretary, accountant, etc.  the marginal employment increase vs investment is close to 0.

as a former high frequency trader, the only reason to colocate is if you are doing arbitrage or hft strategies.  most reputable exchanges have equal access, and they make money by renting out those faciilities.

bitcoin ATM have 5-10% fees from what I know.  Money exchange services have much higher fees (at the airport).  They will charge a fixed fee (like 5$), + exchange rate.  Customer thinks hes paying 5$ fee, but in fact the spread on the rates are horrendous.  So its probably the same to be honest, bitcoin ATM really need to bring the fees down.

A mining operation requires next to no employees to manage the mine.  We are talking about S9 farms here.  S9 farms, your grandma can set up.  no expertise created, very little jobs.  
Bitfarms is active on social media, they can go fuck themselves.  They pollute our local papers with stories of jobs and stuff like that.  Then a study by hydro-quebec came out, basically telling bitfarm that they are full of shit, and they create very little net positive for the province.
I am not against mining, i believe there can be a win win situation here in quebec, but people like bitfarms are lying and plotting, maybe in hopes of getting social acceptance or grants.  
edit:  Data centers make 10 to 20x more employment than a bitcoin mine according to hydro-quebec.

Put most of the money on low risk accounts getting 2-3-4% interest and voila, you now have an inflation protected 40-50-60 (or more) grand a year in income, each year, every year until you die.  Then your kids get it.  or your dog.  whatever.
Whatever is left over you can do stupid things with, like buy a boat.   Or you know, help other people out, donate for a local park you like, environment, etc.  Remember.  Income.  Each year.  Equivalent to a full time good job.  EAch year.  Every year.  Thats called freedom my friend.  freedom to do whatever you want.  You like turtles ? Go be a marine biologist and study turtles.  The rest doesnt matter.

oh well, it does work like that but not like you may think.  So if we double the network hashrate, but it comes from only one person...then the network is not safer.  When new hardware comes along it changes the hashrate distribution also.   Network safety would be a distribution factor, regardless of the *total* hashrate.  For example if asics did not exist and we only used cpu's, then the hashrate would an order of magnitude less, but the network would not necessarily be less safe (assuming asics and gpus dont exist).

not really, no.  the whole scaling "debate" is artificial.  people are paying high fees for an artificial limit, set up to stop spam, in another epoch.  tell me what was the original block size eh.  but yeah agreed though, for a lot of applications, centralized databases win and bitcoin doesnt.  im not even against lightning network or off chain solutions.  scaling on the other hand, its not un-reasonable.  in 20 years, how much will a Tb cost ?  what will be the internet connection speed ? at what cost ?  ill tell you what it will be.  cheap as fuck, thats how much.  dont see the problem to having a 1000000 gig blocksize if I have a 1000000minternet line and a hard drive with 1000000000 tb capacity.

no i disagree.  A warehouse is filled with S9 ASICS (which is what we have in quebec as for mining projects).  For Quebec as a whole, they create next to nothing - but who cares to be honest - the *issue is with the price they want to pay*.
Let me explain.  We have a cold climate.  That means in the dead of winter, -30c for 2-3 weeks straight, our big industrial producers actually shut down production because electricity demand is so high.  Most people *heat with electricity* here.
Big industrial producers play ball with Hydro-quebec.  Aluminum production supports an entire region (Saguenay) through high paying jobs, infrastructure works, etc.  The electricity price is low because of that.  it is subsidized.  We could export it for more. (well not much more right now, but we are connected to the USA).
If you want a big miner, all hydro-quebec is saying is:
-No special rate
-In winter you will have to shut off for a couple days when demand is high.  Or the price is really high when the weather is cold.
And of course the chinese dont understand, because they actually dropped in on hydroelectric station in a medium size city and ask to see the "dam manager" to buy electricity.  They are clueless to how things work here vs how things work in china.

"might".  OF course it was.  It made S9 profitability jump 30-40% for weeks at a time, leading to huge demand and crazy sales in the millions of units.  this 30-40% was super important in that respect, wouldnt surprise me that the fee spamming was bitmain.  S9 sold at top dollar.

mining profits tend so that the marginal profit gets close to 0 for an average miner.  Since the cost of adding 1 extra miner to a mine is very very low, many miners are added until the marginal return from that miner is also close to 0.  So mining difficulty will rise to illustrate that point.  Price action is mostly brought by big players irrespective of mining difficulty.  Since there is a lot of volatility, a large price increase can happen and changes the marginal return of adding 1 extra miner to the farm.  So many, many more miners will be added and difficulty will follow.  Due to the bitcoin algorithm and the time to get miners installed, such difficulty lags by a few weeks.  Or months in the case of a large sustained upswing, where miners cant find enough new hardware and thus push used hardware prices up through the roof, etc.  Keep in mind investing in bitcoin mining is also investing in Bitcoin, so an initial price swing upwards has a few positive feedback loops that sustain it and accelerate it over time.  at least thats my 2 satoshis

A heat pump is more than 100% efficient.  Its the best way to heat.  BUT - It is not effective in siberia due to extreme cold temperatures.  Heat pumps dont work that well under a certain temp.
The other electricity alternative is a radiator, and that has probably almost the same efficiency as a miner.
In any case I save 2500-3000$ of heating bills with rigs, so I can confirm its useful in winter.  Other than that, using s9's if freaking stupid though - unless you like to live next to an airplane engine revving at full speed.

I dont understand the article.  They say they "raised" 6 million in an "IPO", but the shares arent listed, because obviously, shady as fuck and being a public company requires a lot of transparency.
IPO = INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING, as in share offering.  So they DIDNT raise 6 million in an IPO, because the ipo hasnt fucking happened.
6 million of what then ?  private placements ?  who then unload in the IPO ?  
And as in any IPO, there is a % of the overall ownership that is "offered".  what is the % ?  for example they may value the business at 100 million, and raise 10million, because they've only sold 10% of the overall shares.

pretty much the only way to manipulate prices is to control the supply of what is priced.  Market prices are not the sum of all individual estimates they are only the reflection of the most motivated buyer or seller.  Just imagine If you had 1 000 000 bitcoins.  Would you be able to manipulate the price ?  yes.  Such manipulation is illegal in almost all countries and any trading done with the intent to move the price is strictly prohibited on all bourses.

meh have a settlement system coin or something.  IMO land registry is centralized by the gov, so it could be a blockchain, but not a public blockchain.  Bitcoin is a payment system, a settlement system would just piggyback on top of it.

i understand your point, and agree, but this guy would exchange bitcoin for $, and $ for bitcoin.  it could be like buying and selling commodities but so far its a money service

@_date: 2018-03-30 16:15:44
I downvoted your post.  Not because I agree/not agree with it, but because you did not show ANY attempt to actually understand why some people are really, really excited about bitcoin.
And its not the price, its not paying for shit online with it, or any of the things you said.  
Have you read the whitepaper ?  No you havent.
The main takeaway here is the decentralized nature of the invention.  It is integral to bitcoin.  Bitcoin isnt a currency, or a commodity, it is a *technology*.  A *protocol*.
So you invent things to solve problems ?  Thats ok, but thats not why people invent things.  They invent things to make other things *better*, or to do things in a better way.  Not because there was a problem per se.  
So next time there are elections and people complain about irregularities and fraud and need recounts or even court battles - think about - how can we make it better ?
Well we can.  We use the bitcoin technology.  To *decentralize* the election process so no one person is in charge.  No fraud, no disputes, nothing.  Right now you have a system where the people making the voting machines also donate money to political parties and have personal relationships with elected officials.  I wonder how that usually turns out.

@_date: 2018-03-05 13:49:54
jeeeez.  hes running a money exchanging business.  has nothing to do with bitcoin in the eyes of business law.
@_date: 2018-11-28 14:19:02
n00bs trade crypto in relation to USD, which makes no sense.  Bitcoin is the reserve currency.  So exchanges offer USD trading, but due to regulations and laws they are not permitted to do so unless they register as such and are legit (which most arent).  So they invented USDT, which is a shitcoin "backed 100%".  One shitcoin equals one USD.  Now people can trade vs USD (but its USDT).
So as Warren Buffet said that its only when the tide goes out that you see who was swimming naked - when people withdraw *en masse* from exchanges USDT is worthless because everyone was swimming naked.  Which means of course, that USDT is a real shitcoin - no USD behind it.  
Most likely created to address a temporary liquidity problem when banks closed exchange accounts, most likely used to pump the market to get really, really, really rich.  
There is no spoon.

Seems to me this person is somewhat idiotic.  Bitmain ships the miners through DHL for example.  All customs are done and you pay for it.  The "invoice" thing makes no sense because bitmain sends a valuation for the order to DHL, which uses in custom clearing.
It seems this idiot person decided to self-clear (to save a few $ ?) customs.  Of course you need an invoice.  So you log into your bitmain account (OR WHEN YOU ORDER, YOU PRINT THE RECEIPT), and see your orders.  click on that order.  hey look, AN ORDER.
PRINT AND SEND.
WHAT IS THE FUCKING PROBLEM.

@_date: 2018-02-27 21:22:18
not to worry.  If one large order bring the price on one exchange down, profit seeking arbitrageurs will rectify the situation.  On dex exchanges this is probably very easy to implement.  After a while, the prices should be in check.
So in that case, a "lack of liquidity" is only a lack of *visible* liquidity.  Your order will be filled by arbitrageurs if you send it with a few % difference to fair value price.
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:44:45
meh just as bad as "trickle down economics" mwahahahaha
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:02:43

your password may seem strong, but a GPU password cracking rig may beg to differ.  In any case, the best thing you can do is get a hardware wallet.

well you should move your coins to a new wallet (after the block height for the fork), then use the private keys from the old wallet that has no bitcoin in it.  so whatever happens, you wont lose your bitcoin.

terrible.  Why invest in a hedge fund if it follow the market roughly speaking.  0.03% fee index fund, problem solved.
In 2007/2008/2009, if you hedge fund did not deliver stellar returns then people should not invest in you.  Volatilty is good for making money, end of story.  IF you dont, then just what the hell are you doing.
edit:  I'll even make this really, really clear.  What do you think happens when the hedge fund "loses" 10% vs 40%.  They say they are good.  But they need to "restructure" right, so they make a new fund and get the clients to transfer funds there.  Why?  Because they wont make any money off the clients after a 10% loss, since most fees are performance based and have water marks that need to be crossed again.

@_date: 2017-10-05 13:49:03
The business model.
1-  (speculation by me)  Use customer funds to grow operation.  You do not know if you are actually mining or not, or being paid with other users funds.
2-You take all the risk (decreasing payouts due to increasing mining difficulty) while genesis mining has its gear already paid off (you paid it)
@_date: 2016-10-06 15:26:56
well private banks create the money to the consumer/business by themselves creating it (used to be off of reserves, now its unlimited but restricted by capital requirements, tier 1 capital, etc).  
There is no limit to the amount of money, etc.  Think about it, before things cost x$, now they cost 5 times x$, etc.  In the future, it'll be the same.  At some point in 200 years for simplicity, we could retract a 0 or 2.
Finally, everything is debt, but debt=money.  that is the system.  With the debt growing faster and faster, interest rates will keep going lower and lower most probably.  but then again, there is no limit to how low interest rates go down, on % change basis.
The system isnt perfect and favors those that already have money and those that are connected to receive big loans, but when you think about it, it is pretty good.  It is necessary to create things out of nothing - well, its created out of future production/productivity.  It is quite a big power to possess, so that's why the central bank should be independent of political figures, who, as we all know, are sometimes very crooked and favor their own business and interest.  I can't say that Yellen right now is independent.
I feel a good discussion would be on who should possess this power and what are metrics we can use to monitor the efficiency of these people.  IMO thats the problem now.  
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:52:32
IMO bitcoin enthusiasts should care about transactions...its like a ceiling on growth.  That's all it is really.  Any other outside solution is bound to fail, people will just switch to something else.

I'm sorry to intrude, but that is a disingenuous use of statistics....
We have full blocks, and we have empty blocks (when two blocks are mined within a few seconds of each other for example).  So you're "average on 7 days" will reflect that.  If you look at the actual block sizes, its pretty clear its full.
@_date: 2016-10-23 23:59:29
meh, early this year I made a crypto index fund that had tradeable tokens with subscription/redemption, you name it.  Interest wasn't really there.  Also you have to consider the methodology of the fund.  If you have a top 10 market cap index fund for example...well...its doomed to fail for obvious reasons....
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:21:27
This graph means nothing unfortunately.
Please adjust the graph so maybe we can see a meaningful something.  Since the number of reddit subs to r/bitcoin has increased, it is safe to assume that the number of people saying HODL is more correlated to the total number of people rather than the price of bitcoin.
Have the graph represented by BTC price vs number of HODL comment as a % of total comments.

who are you to judge what is blockchain material or not.  In any case dedicated nodes have no problem with the blockchain size, and will not in the future anyway.
@_date: 2016-10-02 01:35:48
nah its simple...think like a trader.  where is the money.  Ah, its in the new coco bonds, where the almighty regulators said : " to reduce risk, we shall incite banks to create convertible bonds".  So If the share price (for example) falls under x$, the coco bonds (billions of bonds) are activated and thus are converted into shares.
So the shareholders are diluted by the proportionate amount of bonds converting, and that would reduce the share price...by....well....most of it.  Welcome to finance, sharks vs sharks.
edit:  to make it clear, if you make the share price go down, the rewards are hugh mongeous.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:56:31
hahahahaha yeah sure, its a deal.
@_date: 2015-11-29 14:23:38
Its a dumb idea.  It means if you send bitcoin and because miners ignore it if the fee is too low, it get "stuck".  so rbf will "unstick" it and resend it with a higher fee.  Why not just up the block size, so we can process more god damn transactions ?  
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:00:05

nono i'm learning.  bandwidth issues is kinda good, takes away from the big farms in china i suppose.  But real world transactions, like a beer for example...so far its pretty much impossible.  sometimes even with a big fee it takes too long.
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:35:37
to be honest, I kinda agree.  BUT having said that, hear me out.  Only nerds understand, but Top Nerds have make tutorials and have spend effort and time making websites and articles on how to do things, that they themselves have painstakingly figured out.  So read them and follow the steps, take your time.  You can do it.  Some people are good and love to share their love of things with others.

@_date: 2015-11-16 20:37:49
yeah thats a good point.  I guess mining fees need to be high enough to entice enough mining power to overcome 51% attack.  Right now though, that would be 0, until block halving at least.  
@_date: 2015-11-12 01:37:48
I think its like a command prompt linked to others that have it, and you can sell/buy custom API's...like "translate this text in Klingon", and someone would sell their api for that or something.
I have no clue.  I'm not buying it.  Its not a miner, you don't mine with it, but it does mine - then somehow you get some btc to buy/sell stuff? work? 
I'll ask my friend who works at cisco, as in, what the hell are they doing over there.  How much is a btc consultant worth by the way :)  ?
@_date: 2015-11-16 20:27:51
im saying miners will adapt to whatever happens.  if you invested large amounts of money in mining, thats risky and you should not lobby your finances onto the rest of the bitcoin world.  even if there was no block reward, and no fee at all - the bitcoin network will still function in my opinion.  in that case a few enthousiasts would do the trick.  you dont need peta hashes for maintaining the network.
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:53:51
"tech savvy guy"  are you shitting me, wtf try electrum, or mycelium.  Dynamic fees.
I buy shit off newegg quite often, and the instant you broadcast the transaction, the website changes to say it is good to go.  Of course if you didnt pay enough fees it won't go through.  sorry for your experience, but the user is also responsible for the bad experience.  welcome to bitcoin.

JP morgan wasnt being "disrespectful" of credit he was just stating a fact.  since all money is technically debt, it is credit.  therefore for a laymans terms of money, gold it is - remember they had the gold standard - everything else was credit.  he made his empire off credit creation.  In that light, the bitcoin goat shit caption makes no sense.

Quite interesting, yes, I did not pose moral judgement on the system really.  compared to what we had before since human kind has been organised in complex civilizations.  I do believe the system will change in the future to another one, maybe on the scale when europe grew out of serfdom.
@_date: 2017-05-14 20:41:01
the point is there is no 12 months on coding, testing, wallet/service/miner integration for a hf.  its not like we havent done a hf before, in btc or any altcoin for that matter.  segwit work is irrelevant to the hf as it can be activated after a hf or not.  wallets and ecosystem will adapt to whatever is the strongest chain.  no diff adjustment needs to be considered.  If people plan to split the fork then there are other issues for sure, but why split a fork over a 2mb block size, that just dumb.

I disagree with the netscape moment.  Sure netscape was awesome, but access was the catalyst.  is like chicken and the egg I guess.  When people had easy and cheap access to the internet, AND a cheap and easy way to browse and use it, then usage took off like a rocket.  The communication networks by computers, and BBS's were all available since way, way before 1995.  the netscape "moment" represents mass adoption.  everything after that is simply more mass adoption.

no it doesnt.  Trustless systems are not impossible, and have not been mathematically proven.  In fact, Bitcoin is an innovation in this respect.  There are built in incentives that make the nodes act a certain way.  
Do you think that bitcoin would be alive in 2018 if you were correct ?  After all the shit we've been through since the start ?  2017-2018 nothing happened by the way compared to before.

the fee is dumb.  if miners dont like a 0 fee transaction, they can fuck off.  by fuck off, i mean turn the miners off and stop mining.  Miners should have no say in the structure of bitcoin, they are biaised participants.  Like oil company doing environmental regulation.
i mine too so...

There are many proposed solutions that need more R&amp;D, like that comment mentions, but a hf to 2mb is quite simple, engineering wise.  Implementation wise, maybe its harder, but that's just because people in bitcoin are hard-headed.

I think people dont really get dark pools.  The transaction itself is not secret, but the bids and offer sizes are kept secret until they match.  well to put it simply.  An OTC trade is pretty much the same, even if its not reported the broker doing it *knows* so it trickles down.

@_date: 2017-06-04 03:02:49
well for starters fiat money is backed by your own person.  because money is actually debt, and its actually a pretty good system.

i dont see any flaws.  its possible the reward of spam transactions is so high that they are all aligned on the same objective by default, or even that cooperation of others is not considered.

well to be honest they sorta did before satoshi, ww2 was a shit storm for crypto with one time pads and shit, codebooks, which was a logistical nightmare.  And no matter how complex it could be cracked.  After the war they got public/private keys.  I highly recommend The Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography if you are into that kind of stuff.  From a historical perspective.

no we still call them fucking spammers

hahahahahahaha well i would agree with you, but when a small group of people control a large % of available float, and conspire together, then market manipulation is easy to do. volumes are easy to fake, and self-trades abound. market manipulation exists, is rampant in altcoins, has existed and still exists in the actual stock market.
just go see any penny shit stock pump and dump...please dont call that "fair value". If I hold a large % of an assets float for example, I can sell it to the shit-hole, prompting others to sell. I then buy everything that others sell. thats manipulation. manipulation = trading with the intent of moving the price. also, I can create fake volume by self-trading and getting hype on this asset. people start to buy in and all sell orders that arent mine, I buy out, so the price goes higher, and higher. at some point no one buys anymore so i just dump it, because profit has already been made. again manipulation there. = trading with the intent of moving the price.
altcoins fit in here because of the worst than brazil distribution of income/holdings, and bitcoin also to a lesser extend.

Because everyone thought Apple was a shit company that was going under.  
Well, not me of course I had macaddict magasine and had apple stickers everywhere.  I was an outcast.  Now i hate apple, and everyone likes it.  funny how the world works.  Sell ?

pump and dumpers are cockroachers, and should be executed :)
edit:  irl, yes, in crypto, well, in crypto its not really serious so its all good.

yeah...posting on kano.is pool thread ?  listen hes right to delete your posts because the pool thread isnt a debate thread.  they already have a position on bip 100 I believe, and we are talking about people who actually made software widely used for mining, and have shown to be trustworthy throughout the years.  maybe their opinion is actually worth something ?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:04:40
meh not really mining at a loss.  you can use the heat in winter and if bitcoin rises, then you'll make a profit.  
@_date: 2017-06-04 18:57:39
you should be worried about muggings and getting your shit stolen from the immense number of fucktards in paris, not terrorism.

meh "hedge fund".  where's the hedge?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:20:11
wow such title.  They do not, in any way, shape or form, advocate banks to spend money to buy cryptocurrencies.
NOWHERE DOES IT ACTUALLY SAY BANKS TO INVEST IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES.
You people, I swear to god
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:27:45
dogecoin is the best to transfer to be honest
@_date: 2018-12-09 00:02:59
you have no idea of the blank stares I get when I tell people that if you dont control the keys its not your bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2017-06-24 02:59:23
ehhhhhhhhhhhhh this kitcoin is truly, truly, without a doubt a proper fucking SHITCOIN

Yes they are driving fees up, its simple math.  How much it costs in fees to drive up price vs how much they get in fees from blocks.  edit:  but not necessarily from these transactions which could just be payments
