you really think BCH is going to top 0.25 BTC again? swapped that shit early and made out like a bandit.

how many times can the same sketch be made over and over again?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:07:46
correct! also, since when is $30 "almost $100"? that's like saying bcash is "almost bitcoin"

mempool clearing - down in the 20-30 fees band and dropping
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:16:51
"Bitcoin (rated C+) gets excellent scores for security and widespread adoption. But it is encountering major network bottlenecks, causing delays and high transactions costs. Despite intense ongoing efforts that are achieving some initial success, Bitcoin has no immediate mechanism for promptly upgrading its software code."
Check the mempool bro!

@_date: 2018-01-23 01:14:31
nobody knows.
lol at saying no dumb answers to a question like that.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:18:14
lol, only after they were outed as being responsible for the huge fees and mempool backlog. scumbags.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:17:38
for sure, not trying to expose my private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:31:48
yes it was. if you held btc on coinbase at the time of the fork (Aug 1st), you will see bitcoin cash in your coinbase account, equal to the amount (not $
value) of btc you held at the time. so, if you had 1 btc, you will now have 1 btc and 1 bch (bitcoin cash, or bcash if you want to be more accurate).
when did you buy your btc?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:31:03
What method of withdrawal did you use, and which country are you in?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:14:26
YOU set the fee, you don't get "charged" anything. You're complaining about your own lack of understanding. read more, post less.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:26:47
yeah but when they've already cribbed so much from bitcoin, what's another one?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:40:09
haha, not gonna lie, i saw someone post it for the 11k wall yesterday and thought it was gold. reposted it for good luck @ 12k. (it worked)
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:22:50
Yeah that's fair enough, just funny to read that given the current state of the mempool

Bitcoin Atom fork in 2 blocks... anyone know anything about it or should I not ask that here?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:36:42
ah, so just a bit too late for the bitcoin cash fork.
i shouldn't leave without recommending your move your coins off coinbase and into your own private wallet, for security purposes. plenty of links around this sub to help you out in that regard. it is basically the  rule of crypto ownership. send them to gdax first, and you can send them to your own wallet for free (gdax pays the fee)
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:15:16
they aren't if you have any idea what you are doing
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:50:04
ha, didn't know that.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:14:43
Thanks mom
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:11:27
was similar at 11k, that bad boy will come down
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:17:02
no worries, let me know if it goes thru!
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:05:22
lately, yeh. check out these links to check the status of the mempool and tx's waiting to be confirmed.
this shows the wait for 300sat/b is something between 20 mins and 13 hours.
you can look at the history of the mempool here. as you can see, in the last 10 hours the mempool has filled up with 300-500sat/b transactions, causing the delay for you. zoom out to 2 weeks, and you'll see that this is a relatively minor spike.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:50:09

@_date: 2018-01-03 16:27:15
depends on the exchange, but most will eventually let you access the forked coins. which exchange are you using?
also, you don't get "extra btc" from a fork, although a lot of people swap their new coin for btc as soon as they can.
if you held btc at the time of the fork, you will have the new coins.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:17:19
you could also try a tx accelerator service. never used one myself, so can't recommend one specifically, but they work.
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:36:29
i think most people that are active on r/bitcoin have disposed of their BCH

@_date: 2018-01-23 16:50:39
yeh, sure seems like a big player has either adopted batching, segwit or both. doesn't seem like it would be coinbase, because we'd probably have been told about it. nice to see any way.

No sweat. Post the txid if you want us to double check that is the actual fee

@_date: 2017-12-08 16:40:05
i feel like i have learned more about how the financial world works because i am researching bitcoin than i ever would have otherwise. sure, just following the price is a time sink, but learning about the current system, why it is in place, and how it could be improved is very valuable knowledge, to say nothing of learning about blockchain tech.

move it to GDAX and sell it there
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:08:55
the funds needs to be in a segwit wallet before you can benefit from segwit. as a trezor owner, i had to send my funds from my legacy wallet to my segwit wallet. you will have to do the same. it sends from a 1 address because the funds are currently in a wallet with a 1 address.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:13:44
just tried both coinbase and gdax using incognito tabs, and both default to bitcoin, not bcash.

nope, sorry. seems like a problem on polo end? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:27:11
are we talking, hundreds, thousands, or more? that will determine which wallet is best for you
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:15:58
yep, no problem at all. unfortunately there is no benefit in sending to a segwit address, but now that you have your coins in a segwit wallet, your next transaction will benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:06:53
i think it's a combo of r/btc idiots, plus the mainstream nocoiners getting wind of a dip. this is the first dip the mainstream has been exposed too, so they don't understand.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:04:05
Of course!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:14:38
yep, you should move your coins to the segwit wallet on your Trezor. that would cut your fees and get your coins moved faster.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:21:20
Yep, check coinbase Twitter / website 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:28:56

these questions will all be answered in the sidebar links. take some time to read through the beginners stuff. this is not something you can just understand in 5 minutes, and if you are serious about putting your money on the line, you should take the time to do the research. the answers are freely available :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:13:25
i may be wrong but that seems to be the only reason that BCH is holding value at the moment. a lot of people would rather just swap BCH for BTC than sell BCH to buy BTC given the fees at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:09:16

it's not, but in any context, Michael Scott and Ed Truck is hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:58:29
adding BCH is not the problem. the way they did it is the problem. shady as hell, and they deserve to lose some business over this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:57:31
don't have to be a professor to know you can't send BCH to a BTC address without some repercussions. and holding your own private keys is crypto 101.
take it as a (n expensive) lesson learned. plenty of others have experienced the same. So my advice stands: go in educated, or risk learning these expensive lessons.
class dismissed.

segwit is the interim solution. it needs to be used. it will work if it is adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:40:15
this video explains shorting, but it doesn't explain what that post above actually means. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:19:59
because the price went up and most exchanges have their fees linked to the price of bitcoin. bitcoin is not a finished product. what you are seeing is the creaks and groans of a technology being massively adopted

@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:28
so you were able to transfer BCH out of a coinbase wallet? i thought they didn't support BCH yet?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:24:34
funny, we were all in here waiting for a huge dump, instead we are seeing it gradually circle down the drain because they haven't opened selling on coinbase, nor can you trade BCH for BTC on gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:11:01
yep, give the txid. nothing will show up in the wallet yet because the tx isn't confirmed yet
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:51:13

misleading OP
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:24:42
no problem. bitcoin is a work in progress and you learn as you go. i have found that since there is $ involved, you rarely make the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:36:47
yup those fruits and veggies are really fucking things up for everybody.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:24:06

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:11:24
It won't go thru because the network is clogged with high fee transactions due to exchanges setting high fees
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:52:23
i wouldn't own bitcoin from way back if i cared what the general public think
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:48:35
i think fees already make up the majority of miner profits.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:31:47
wait until they support it, or else nothing. this is just one reason not to hold your coins on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:51
BCH / BTC trading should go live on GDAX pretty soon...

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:03:58

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:18:17
cool, thanks for taking the time
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:50:34
BTC will probably lead the recovery, so not a bad time to swap for super depressed alts
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:12
BTC and BCH are trending almost identical this morning. didn't see that coming.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:48:10
check coinbase, they should have the txid. post it here
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:34:15
this is a recent thing for Bcash. used to be inversely correlated, but now looks correlated like all the other alts. BTC is and always was, king
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:49:05
No problem. Learning about how bitcoin works is super satisfying once you can see the forest for the trees
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:13:14
"BCH pumping"... check BCH vs BTC price... yeah a real pump....

bitcoin cash is bitcoin with bigger block sizes, which means an increased risk of centralization due to the exponential growth of the blockchain size caused by block size increase.
don't blame other people for your own laziness.

yeh because bitcoin has finished all of it's development and is a finished product...
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:16:17
We went mainstream too soon. The normies don't understand it. It's not their fault, they weren't meant to be here during development. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:28
the lack of fight back is concerning
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:11:15
Yep, correct. The fee was higher than the transaction total, but it was paid for by GDAX.

she didn't send him the 320 BTC... that is the remaining balance in her wallet after giving him the 0.04 BTC, which is the same amount he sent to the fake address.

awesome! glad i can now recommend coinomi to people. great wallet.

sucks, but i bet you'll never do it again! chalk it up to a learning experience.
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:56:11
Yep. If a well intentioned person can do it, then you can be damn sure a bad actor is also doing it. If all this does is force people to consider the way they transact with bitcoin, it is a positive thing.
Thanks, I followed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:18:00
no, just make sure you are in the BCH window when you hit sell
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:52
he'd buy the dip
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:32:44
just wait. the two tx's are fine - one is the send to shapeshift, the other is your 'change' ie. the rest of your account balance going back to your wallet. the tx just hasn't gone thru yet because you paid an average fee (~250 sat/B), and the mempool is quite full right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:01
no catch, the BCH are yours, and you can sell, trade or HODL them.
most people on this sub are selling (and turning the $ into BTC) because they believe BTC is superior to BCH
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:24:46
you were owed that Bcash, coinbase or not. i accessed my free bcash months ago because i didn't store my coins on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:10:53

@_date: 2017-11-28 20:40:13
Got it. So the BTC you bought today will be locked in at the price when you hit buy. However, depending on how you paid for them, they may not be available in your Coinbase wallet for another week or so. Yes, you should definitely transfer them to your own wallet (I would recommend a Trezor) as soon as they become available in your Coinbase wallet.
As for your fiat transfer, again, I think it will be available to use to purchase BTC once it clears, but not until then.

Cool volume bro. that article is laughably poor. 
"Since bitcoin cash in its very nature is designed to offer low transaction speeds, it then follows that it is the cheaper crypto when compared to bitcoin even with the introduction of the lightning network. The lightning network is only useful when transferring bitcoins between wallets that support it."
mhm... designed to offer low transaction speeds? interesting.
the lightning network is only useful when using it for it's designed purpose? wow, that is a revelation!

quite a few! right now it is reasonably easy for the average user to setup and run a full node, if necessary. the issue with increasing block size is that this would potentially no longer be the case.

Anecdotally, I checked when they said it was 25% rolled out, and I still had a '1' address on my (empty) coinbase wallet. Just checked, and it is now a '3' address, so it seems they have done more than the 25% roll out for sure.

could be, but not if it works. BCH 'was' pumping for a little while there. sending tiny transactions between your own addresses (so no loss there) using tiny tx fees (minimal loss) can have a big impact on the mempool.

Yep, when Bcash started there were a lot of very suspect (read: spam) transactions clogging the mempool along with high volume of regular transactions. roger and bcash shills were right that fees were high and conf times were long, because they were making sure that was so! they lost.
