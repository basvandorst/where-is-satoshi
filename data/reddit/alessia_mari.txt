I had a similar problem! They stole my bitcoin with proofs.
I had transfered 0,370046 (around 600€) BTC to my Wirex Account. It arrived and was confirmed.
I exchanged 0,127187 BTC (around 200€) into Euro on the same day.
After this exchange my Bitcoin amount was 0,039668 as you can see on the Screenshot below: 
Conclusion: 0,370046 BTC - 0,127187 BTC = 0,242859 BTC (around 400€) are missing!!!
I wrote to the support and have uploaded screenshots of my issue. "Brian" the supporter said that the resolution of the screenshot is not good enough. I have sended him 3 new screenshots. No reply. No Solution. I will call the police and my lawyer.
Beware of that company as I see that I am not the only one with the same problems!
If any of the "Wirex" Staff will see this message and want to change my opinion: These are my support ticket numbers 111923 and 111918.
I will reply as soon as the problem is solved - promise.

Wirex ist definitly NOT reliable. You cannot trust in the product. You cannot trust in the support. And of course you can never be sure if they have some new "glitches" which freeze your money, or steal you bitcoin and give them back after 10 Days of texting to the support. Always use your own Wallet, never Wirex. Just load that much as you need.
