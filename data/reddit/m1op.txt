Your missing the most important one.   MINE ONLY FOR THE LOVE OF BITCOIN, NOT THE MONEY (BECAUSE THERE ISNT ANY)

What are you talking about?  All I see in the new queue are the same questions asked over and over again and people here are actually taking the time to respond.  bitcoin is not perfect and is acknowledged all the time.  there is plenty of quality discussion here, considering its reddit not bitcointalk.

If all of the overdraft takes place on one day, is it just the single $10 charge?  Then you can just balance transfer the entire amount to a 0% card for 18 months and pay it off with Bitcoin profits.  Dangerous plan if things fall apart, but yeah Ive looked at this.

Great business model.  International travelers with a few spare minutes in the airport unload unwanted foreign currencies that are worth little more than mementos once they get home.  Enormous fees? Sure it's better than basically worthless rupees or whatever.  Let me play with some Bitcoin.

So I bought a netbook solely for the purpose of keeping my coins offline. I placed my wallet file ... on the netbook in an encrypted file.
Why on a netbook if you wanted to keep them offline?

How does this explain why its so hard to buy bitcoin?  
Misleading blog nonsense.  'Maybe there is a better way to do this', yes buying Second Life credits and using Gox isnt a best practice guys.

Bitcoin is math,  math does not 'ethical'.

Buy gyft cards?

Bitstamp was selling off while Gox was stable/growing.  Just saying that by watching each market's activity you could follow who may have been reacting to the hearing.

Old people get liquified and fed to the young anyway.  What do they need Bitcoin for ?

Do it and report back

It will pass.  We are due for a boring news cycle or two about bitcoin.  Hopefully the price will stabilize for a bit so people will spend as well as hoard.

Yeah they got their concepts crossed.  Just as it is an investment in your time and energy to better understand bitcoin itself, any content source that helps me understand what the heck is going on in China and why is also useful.

act now or forever hold your fiat.  seriously though, if you had the chance to acquire something that has been both increasing in value AND created conveniences in your life, wouldn't you?  thats bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:25:35
It really depends how fast it rises.  There was a correction the other night when price was escalating $100 an hour and yes the price went down for a while.  A slow steady rise like what got us from $200 to $400 is more likely to hold.

A lot of people sold early
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:56:56
how long did the transaction take start to finish?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:34:37
It really is fantastic with a great user interface

Can taxes be avoided this way?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:47:17
Huge spread between Gox and Bitstamp right now seems like a good way to know who and who isnt paying attention to this hearing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:12:33
Your not buying from other sellers in the market on Coinbase, you are buying from Coinbase itself.  Actually Coinbase isnt even selling any coins right now.  Coinbase is good for ease of entry into bitcoin but not much else ATM.
