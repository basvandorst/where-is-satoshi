Timing? It would be a single variable change for the majority of miners. It doesn't matter though, enough large miners have said they won't switch, so the whole thing is dead in the water. Bitfury, F2Pool and other make up well over 25%. 
Next move is for Hearn to change it to 50% or less, and hard code his blocks into XT and BitcoinJ like has said he will to enforce the fork. It'll be completely centralized and controlled by one man, but he will get his way no matter what. Don't believe me?

This is the stuff that comes before he takes over the project, what follows if he manages it? It seems unlikely at any rate, the only block voting for bitcoin XT was a test block by Slush (they are allowing their users to opt in to voting for it tomorrow if they desire).

People are blindly running XT already without noticing that there's a lot more modifications there than meet the eye. 


If its the crisis that people are proposing it is they will want to get that lock in as soon as possible, won't they? It's not happening however much Hearn wants it.

You'll notice that the single block ever mined in support of Bitcoin XT was a test by slush for an internal voting system, and that they have gone back to producing normal blocks once more. Miners on Slushs pool can now manually opt into voting for XT blocks but I seriously doubt anybody will on any scale, it effectively amounts to suicide to give control of the system to Mike Hearn (remember, it's just him, Gavin took a tactical holiday for the week). It's not mentioned a lot, but nobody is rushing to make blocks with the version bit set because it is quite frankly, insane. 
You can downvote me, but where's the masses of XT supporting blocks? :)

The problem is that it exposes every running node with *default* settings to a single remote server. It introduces new code dependencies, and has absolutely no code review whatsoever. There's no reason for it to exist as it provides no protection against denial of server whatsoever.

Only if he wanted it to say "URGENT: Alert key compromised, upgrade required".

Alert key doesn't do anything of value.

* Get UTXOs was rejected because it only exists to serve Lighthouse, and introduces a network command with high probability for misuse.  
* The DNS seeds added were removed due to concerns of impartiality. 
* Tor blacklisting was rejected due to the horrible approach and significant tradeoffs. 
If they were just innocuous they would be in Bitcoin Core.
