1) This is just false.

Sales pitch is something like:
Hey guys, have $$$ that you may want to convert to btc one day?! Is it just sitting there, burning a hole in your bank account?? Just give me that $$$, and I'll hold on to it. 
One day, when you're ready to spend em on something in bitcoinland, give the word and I promise promise promise to give you that $$$'s equivalent in Bitcoins! 
Trust me with your cash... I may not be certified or insured by the SEC or any other financial regulatory institution, but I'm very active in the bitcoin community!

My favorite are the comments from the syncophants that go something like..."I, for one, continue to have full faith in the veracity and ability of our dear leaders at BFL..."
As if that by being meek they will be rewarded for their obedience and be blessed with a working product shipped before their "heretical" counterparts.
It's some strange prison psychology brewin' in that forum.

It doesn't excuse the vitriol? It doesn't make it a scam?
I disagree. They deserve the vitriol. They deserve the con-artistry accusations.
All evidence points to them misrepresenting their development phase/shipping dates. Some people defend BFL. they say, "stop complaining, you're all greedy! it's about securing the network! they didn't promise that you'd make money at it!" This is BESIDES the point. What they DID advertise is that they would ship by a certain date, dates which they repeatedly broke. People paid for their hardware under false pretenses; if Sony did this, it would easily merit a class action lawsuit. Maybe ASIC mining is still highly profitable come ship date, maybe it's not--it might mitigate the hurt, but it doesn't change the fact that what they did was scam behavior.
 The unique nature of bitcoin means that, as time passes, the value of the machine that they've sold to their customers depreciates significantly. When you sell pre-orders and then lie about your dates, you're ripping off you customers. It would be kind of like buying a top-of-the-line $3,000 alienware PC because they claim you'll get it in a week. Instead, it takes them a year. When it finally ships, the hardware is obsolete, and the computer is only worth $2,000. You have a right to complain--they owe you $1,000! Because they lied about shipping dates, Alienware was able to sell you a $2,000 computer for $3,000.
If anyone thinks this is fair, I have a 2013 BMW for sale, payable immediately, for a significant market discount, shipping June 2013 ( I reserve the right to deliver it in twenty years.)
