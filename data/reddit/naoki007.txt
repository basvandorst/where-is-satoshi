That's awesome

Yes coinbase needs to go. Everyone needs to move their coins from them.
@_date: 2016-03-07 05:58:08
Yeah it's very bullish.

Exactly. Computer scientist just need to make the Bitcoin protocol efficient and fix all the bugs. They are doing exactly that and doing excellent job so far. Satishi already put the incentive and concensus mechanism in place so nothing else needs to be done. The market decides how Bitcoin will be used.

Coinbase support sucks
@_date: 2016-03-06 22:10:31
Move far away from Coinbase!

Move ur btc from Coinbase asap.
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:11:44
No need to be governed. Once the protocol layer is complete, developers can code whatever the heck mainstream want on top. Until then let the computer scientist do what needs to be done.
@_date: 2016-03-11 04:36:20
I agree. It's getting ready to launch.

These companies are all mis-aligned with bitcoin protocol and eventually will go out business.

Classic clones, no different than XT clones.
@_date: 2016-02-04 15:42:16
Yay!! It's the difference between professionals verse amateurs. Money talks!
@_date: 2016-02-29 03:15:14
Yes weighted on BTC amount
@_date: 2016-02-16 08:55:30
Yup they are all fake
@_date: 2016-02-23 15:12:46
Sweet 
@_date: 2016-02-08 08:17:20
Is classic dead yet?
@_date: 2016-02-10 15:46:46
Will this be the final attack from Gavin? Classic is already dead before even launching as most level headed miners are not onboard. 
@_date: 2016-05-11 00:02:16
So he can capitalize on Bitcoin sooner than later as it will take a while for Bitcoin to fully realize its potential.

I'm hodling until halving and plan to not convert to fiat.
