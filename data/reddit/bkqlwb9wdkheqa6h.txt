I like $195 mbillion better
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:18:52
Yes but how do you make sure it doesn’t get squatted and that the same thing doesn’t happen again?
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:19:32
Still plenty of time to $1M
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:28:45
Can you give us your BTC address? I’d like to not send you any money

Diamond ring engagement tradition is the stupidest thing ever invented. I just proposed to my wife without a stupid ring and she was fine without it. We have a great marriage, one we made the way we want it to be, not how jewelry company  commercials want it to be

Healthcare companies get rich because healthcare is decided by a committee of people who get paid off by healthcare. Regardless someone should not have to pay to help someone else if they don’t want to. You should only help if you want to. Otherwise it is violence
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:34:56
What about gold?
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:18:57
They should be
@_date: 2019-06-08 00:38:53
It depends on the reason they move.  Some would assume a vulnerability. I can’t think of a good reason

Where did you get that 3 BTC note? Looks nice!
@_date: 2019-06-09 18:03:53
So you will lose your bitcoins if you don’t take them out? Doesn’t sound legal to me
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:58:52

Definitely going over $100k, it is like a magnet.  Once we get a new ATH we won’t see &lt;$10k again
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:53:17
You will know for sure when it makes a new ATH
@_date: 2019-09-14 01:25:51
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:05:26
Haha thinking like that is not really good for him
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:04:16
If it breaks above this resistance, it’s going to $10k
@_date: 2019-05-29 02:54:17
Or 10,000 pizzas
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:01:17
$10k here we come

Do you have an invite code?
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:41:54
Good job, I hope it all works out and I wish you the best.  Your ex-wife is making a huge mistake, all the bitcoin in the world isn’t worth missing out on being with your child and watching them as they grow up
