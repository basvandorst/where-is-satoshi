Bitcoin is a new asset - so once many people in the same country hold it and also trade it - it's adding value to the total GDP configuration.
For example, if every third person in New Zealand will own a new $20k diamond tomorrow morning - This will surely increase the country's GDP.

Good points!
I agree that a stock gives you an equity in a business and bitcoin is different in that way (not sure if it's better or worst - time will tell I guess)
A business's success is heavily depended on decisions by a very small group of people (same can be said for fiat).
Bitcoin on the other hand is more "democratic" (not perfect but getting there) and that makes it a whole new concept of a global value instrument. 
But still - if you compare the "fiat potential" of crypto and stocks they are not so different - driven by market speculates and analyst and are exposed to similar forces in the short run.
My point is - The long run of bitcoin is unknown - stock we know too well, so it's easy to compare to what we know but it might be like comparing the internet to television 25 years ago ;)

I partly agree, but only partly - because the market cap of a traded company is also not determined by the amount of fiat that goes into that stock.
Some people who never sold their apple stock from the 70's are millionaires on paper but no money switched hands.
The price of a stock is conceptual - same as the price of anything else.
And one more point - if you have $1B in Tesla stocks you can't get $1B the next day for it - the price will drop once you sell that amount and you will probably have less fiat eventually. Same for BTC (just different scales).
Different financial instruments - but same old human psychology :)

Interesting - can you please explain?

Isn't the moon inevitable..?!

Completely Right!
In fact that is the reality whether some people like it or not and time will tell if these are good assets to hold or not.

Agree 100%!

Bitcoin is here to stay - The question is only what financial instrument it will turn out to be.
It will not replace all Fiat of the world - people that think that this is the goal are usually the skeptics.
But for now it is the main currency of the internet and we are just starting... 
My bet is that this is going to be a VERY bumpy ride, like it's been so far, but in the greater scheme of things we are witnessing the "internet of value" - no less!

The next 50 years will move much much faster than the past 50 years - My point is that we can't even imagine where this will go by then... But in a more reasonable time frame (5-10 years) we can estimate better where this might go. And fiat will probably still be here.

Glad to help :)

We still don't have the technology to operate a single blockchain that will hold all the world's currency transactions - this might be an option in the future.
However, I believe that comparing bitcoin to fiat or stocks is like comparing tv and newpapers to the internet.. it's shortsighted and what eventually happens is: all 3 still exist and have different functions in our lives. 
Bitcoin introduces a new financial dimension but not necessarily an alternative for everything.

100% Correct!
That's why a market cap measurement alone is wrong and deceiving.

I believe that several more valuable cryptocurrencies will arise in the near future - these will also be good to invest in.
As Naval said: The winning blockchains might have more than a Trillion Dollars market cap... The winners will identify those early on.

I don't agree with you on the following points:
1. 100M people investing $6k IS a huge number!!! For example: the UK population is 65M and the average monthly salary is around $3K - 3 months of pay from the entire UK is not a joke, Just to give you some sense of the number.
2. I agree that it's still peanuts when compared to Apple's market value or the USA dept, but just because some numbers are bigger doesn't mean this one is small. 
3. The market cap is fictitious - meaning, $65B didn't when in at once, maybe only $6B when in and the value in the mind of people increased - like any other stock etc'. (this contradict my first point but it's another angel of explaining why I think you are wrong).
4. I don't think you understand the underlying infrastructure of today's blockchain mining the amount of funded companies that operate in the bitcoin ecosystem alone - it's really big and increasing rapidly.
5. Only 0.01% of the world population works directly in silicon valley's tech companies - it doesn't mean they have 0.01% impact on the world. So your example about the amount of people this affects is not logical. 
I believe your rationalization is too linear in an exponentially developing world.
