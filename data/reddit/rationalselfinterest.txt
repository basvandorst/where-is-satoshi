The guys over at StackExchange would like a word with you.

It's definitely the currency of the future.

Wow, calm down there.
I constantly see bitcoiners write about how these kinds of attacks make the network stronger.
Also, don't take your frustrations out on someone who's demonstrating a weakness in the network. When a bank gets hacked, the bank gets shat on. If bitcoin can't stand up to one guy echoing bad transactions, guess who's to blame in the end?
Lastly, isn't from the UK. Why should he submit to UK laws? This point amuses me the most given how many folks on this subreddit seem to have disdain for current governments, but then want these governments to help them when things go wrong...

Strangely similar to the "this is the year of the Linux desktop" articles that used to abound.

Exactly! 
It would be in your rational self-interest to submit a patch to the core developers which implements your proposed fix.
Open a pull-request on github, and I'm sure they will merge it quickly (it's in their rational self-interest to do so).
@_date: 2015-10-15 07:48:50
So when is the patch being released then?

You shouldn't be downvoted for this, Android is the mobile OS [most plagued with malware (on par with Windows)]( and disproportionate to its market share.
@_date: 2015-10-04 18:24:30
It is in the community's (and core devs') rational self-interest to roll out these changes post-haste!
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:12:23
When will deployment of this patch be finished?

It appears that your students are being indoctrinated by their statist parents :(
Otherwise they would have fully embraced the blockchain and allowed themselves to become enlightened.

Disclosure: although I don't like bitcoin, but I posted this here in case bitcoiners would like to ask the guy questions.
I see a lot of derisive comments thrown at him, especially over at the bitcointalk forum, but not much in actually trying to understand how this problem affects users in general, or how hard the problem is for devs to fix.
Anyroad, thanks to moderators for letting this thread stand.

Also deleted his reddit account, so I guess that means he can't remove this post either.
Smart chap.
@_date: 2015-10-04 13:52:26
The free market will find a way to counteract this problem.
@_date: 2015-10-04 12:20:40
You have a point, however I feel that it is moot. Nobody would actually ever exploit this vulnerability since it would be against their rational self-interest to do so.
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:10:59
You're welcome! :)
Though no users are actually doing this. amaclin is simply doing an AMA there.

BiT_cOiN is truly the currency of the future.

You should hire an attourney and sue, if you feel you have that right.
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:49:41


True, except for the multitude of binary blobs that most distros ship so that you have an actual userful desktop system.
Remember the Ubuntu-Amazon debacle? Desktop Linux isn't immune to this kind of thing.

Just today I payed 0.6€ for my morning coffee. I had plenty of time to sip it and consider the day ahead of me during the 10 minutes it took for the cashier to confirm the transaction using the coins I handed her. *Exactly* like bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:00:03


Hah! XD
The "stress tests" of the last few months that brought the network to a standstill and the [current ongoing malleability attack]( prove otherwise.
This latest incident is just *one guy* fucking around. Do you think that an organized group of people exploiting this same problem couldn't easily crash the bitcoin markets if they wanted to?
Try doing the same thing to the USD or Euro from your basement...
