I have my ledger s on my keychain all the time, doesnt matter if they rob that one, okay its 60 dollars down the drain but they cant do anything without the pin.
Also it looks like a regular usb stick on a keychain.

I have not much to say about the presidents of other countries as its a really deep matter. My knowledge isnt as omnipotent i wish it would be so i refrain from continuing doing any hate trains that seems to be a meme right now about the current president of the united states.

So it receives and gets money basically by solely connecting the receive and send function by using a mircoSD card?
How do i get my bitcoin back when as an example the coldwallet gets destroyed. Others have a seedphrase, but how does the seedphrase work if it was never connected to the internet? I hope you know what i want to ask with this.
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:19:06
Lmao. Everyone knows you get a nice booklet and write down the seed code and put it into a safe or deposit box if you start trading with 1-2 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:12:04
Well it means ppl go buy more silver/gold and spend more on stocks.
Those who dont fall behind.
@_date: 2019-11-21 10:41:01
But i prob die before 2100. Thats what i mean with that.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:10:11
I personally dont have that much bitcoin, but i solely use coinbase for some flipping. I know binance is more cheaper but its a hassle, coinbase is so much smoother with everything.
I usually put around half of the money i invest onto my ledger s , hack can come but seriously, atm its only asians getting hacked.

Central Bank model has its porpuse, it led eu to prosper in many ways.
They set the interest rate to 0 which makes money be able to let new companies invest faster.
The whole low interest rate banks give to people leads to people going into stocks or gold which makes these more valuable and or profitable and also leads to economic prosperity. Or they spend it which also a job of inflation. Our system is good as it is, leading to people wanting to do more with their saved money aka crypto, stocks or gold/silver.

Ah thank you that explains it. Just saw this topic only once when someone interviewed trump and he mentioned this but explain it why this is bad.
@_date: 2019-11-20 08:01:04
Made me really interested! How does the coldcard receive money if its not connected to the internet? In the same way it sends money by switching over an sd card ?
I mean it sucks that it only supports bitcoin tho...
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:25:42
But how does the seed recover my money if the New replacement wallet isnt connnected to the Internet?
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:42:01
Only regret i have is not buying today opposed to yesterday. Then again i could say that all day.
I guess its cheapest will be during 10th-14 of decemeber as it was that way last 2 years.
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:47:44
Dont bet everything on bitcoin tho, stocks are more save as a general investment, and gold/silver is nice as a backup incase you need something expensive(car completely broke, or injury etc). Imagine being someone buying on the great 15k drop and you think aaah naw it wont get more down and then you are screwed when bitcoin suddenly goes and stays at the 3k mark
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:34:49
No i want it in my home safe. So i can buy on a drop and half a year or months later sell again on a peak.
I have spread some money on crypto phone wallets, and want to put the seed code into my brothers safe that is inbuild and hidden inside a wall. I mostly do this to transfer the free student loan i get that is half state funded into something better than fiat money. Im not allowed to have wealth over 7,500€ so i am depositing the rest into bitcoin opposed to lots of stocks.
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:14:18
How  does the seed Phrase know how much money i have before i ever connect it to the Internet?
@_date: 2019-11-21 10:42:32
Sorry i still dont get it maybe im too dumb. I just dont understand if the coldwallet is always offline, it gets broken, i go buy another one . How does my new wallet ever knows how much money i have as the seed code never changes?
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:39:32
Then it gets hacked.
@_date: 2019-11-19 10:48:29
Bitcoin is a complicated matter but its not worth it really if you "invest"  $20 . Either you know what you do and are daily trading or you get a trezor one or something (a hardware wallet) get a safe or a safe place to stash it and buy like 500-1k $ worth of bitcoin, wait a few years and then sell it again or hold it forever until you need it.
I recommend going into a free brokerage and buy a couple of small stock that is worth it more as even someone with barely any knowledge and low spending habits.
Bitcoin is at this point almost buying gold, while the rest are other various metals you basically try to speculate which will be needed in a future product or used as a silver replacement .

Well i do life comfortably, i will inherit a house my parents build despite them being only a nurse and a construction worker. Germany is a big wellfare state and the low income sector is the less pressured. The people who are in danger mostly are people in the middle class switching to the low income sector due to their tax system.
That aside, yes thats what i basically said, germany has a huge gdp growth but a huge low income sector. Yet our country is more busy banning diesel cars from cities so middle class people who bought these cars are completely fucked. (especially when they have a loan). There is a lot of crappy shit going on here but that is another matter. You can and will live good here tough.
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:08:48
Well fiat money itself also. I think the only real stable currency ever is gold, but that one isnt useful for day to day life.
"Yes sir 1 cheeseburger, this makes 0.000001 g of gold."
"Thank you kindly."
@_date: 2019-11-21 01:00:55
How does it "turn all reliable economic equations upside down"? All you say is if people make more money , it will create a higher inflation rate. 
But the thing is $ is the basis on how we actually compare our currency with others. The only thing it might add would be add a higher inflation to the dollar which makes the eu want to make a higher inflation too. Basically its a battle who gets closest to the $
If the us wants to boot us out its better with a higher inflation rate so our currency conversion is just plain higher which makes exports more costly.

I heard with flash drives you have to occasionally use them so they get power again. I would really like to know a set or estimated lifespan from these companies.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:46:55
I didnt study economics except one course i had in university . Im also not really that familliar about the the whole world economics as a whole as its a very complicated matter but i can only say that shortly after getting the euro germany had a good economic gdp growth . Im just a bit familliar with my own country but would like to know if that wasnt the case with the other eu countries.
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:01:12
So what would happen if my wallet suddenly got destroyed?
The seed the wallet gave me, how do i restore it? I just have a hard time grasping how a seed system actually works without the internet.
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:39:15
Ah okay. that makes sense!
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:08:10
Doesnt really change much for people.
Those who have lots of bitcoin will just continue using a ledger, trezor or coldwallet instead.
At tops it could be useful if you have like 10-20 bitcoin to put the seed code into a bank vault.
@_date: 2019-11-11 23:02:24
But we need some of the copper and other stuff in building Things. Would make the very poor Lots of Problems.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:42:12
I think its good to have many alternatives, from crypto, to fiat, to gold, to stocks even.
Paper money will never not lose its purpose until atleast we are dead.
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:51:13
Mhm i do have some other cryptos, mainly bat, ether and litecoin. But im less interested as i dont have time to invest daily.
I can get a trezor one for 52€ and a ledger s for 59 € on amazon, but i wait for the black friday sale maybe i get a good deal.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:51:38
The first part is totally right as its true. Germany has the highest low income sector in the whole eu while having one of the best unemployment rate. I guess any work is better than none, aslong as it feeds you and makes you live comfortably(as thats somewhat the case if you work low income and dont have kids outside of marriage)
The second part is something im not familliar with as inflation is a rather complicated matter especially on the part with china how they try to keep apparently their currency so low so they can get a better dollar rate. Or am i wrong?
@_date: 2019-11-30 17:02:19
Why buy in one of those bitcoin as mostly internet fees or private people selling it are way much more cheaper?
Those things are only useful if they TAKE bitcoin and send out cash.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:55:58
You didnt read what i ment really but okay.
You also tought i am locking up my trezor for years in some safe deposit in a bank.
Thats not what i am planning to do, its more like a way to circumvent the state from cutting my benefits for being a student. They dont want me to save money and i dont want to safe fiat money that much because its just going down due to inflation and wont make me money opposed to stocks or cryptos.
@_date: 2019-11-19 17:36:41
I tend to differ.
Silver is always good when fiat is unstable.
I would say silver even is sometimes even more long therm as you dont know when the next financial crisis comes.
Gold is way more stable and stocks can be a mixed bag and are more similliar with bitcoin in that sense.
@_date: 2019-11-20 20:18:07
Thats an interestening opinion and i would tend to agree to you partially. Germany (where im from) has the biggest low income sector in the whole eu despite being export wise king. It still doesnt negate the fact that this kind of system helped the economy a lot and there is a reason the current usa president also wants a lower bank interest rate.
@_date: 2019-11-23 14:16:19
With bitcoin no one can control how much money you own.
Buy lots of bitcoin , write down the code and go over the border with a simple piece of paper inside your wallet. Heck i can imagine a distopian future people will remember their seed code so the governments cant find their paper wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-19 14:54:20
Spreading is good.
Buy some bitcoin, some etherium, lite etc , some gold, maybe silver and some stock.

I had the same recently.
I saved a couple of bucks, around +4k during my teenage years for a car. Now i got really into biking and used 2k to buy  a new bike and a ps4. Then i went to millitary and didnt really need a car as i got free public transportation.
So i had 2k+ and got the urge to buy myself a car despite i live in my parents house, studying in an university that is literally 4 km away with my bike. I instead used the money to get a new gtx1060 and used the 2k to invest into bitcoin and stocks, 1500 into stocks and 500 into bitcoin. So far the bitcoin thing didnt pay out and i made around 30-50€ loss and i didnt bought on the bottom of the drip but about halfway trough it. As soon as my 500€ investment is worth i will continue to invest more probably, but so far only the stocks thing is really something i dig and have more controle over. I probably will either keep the 1/4 ratio bitcoin to stocks lessen it slightly depending how my stocks do(so far good) or increase it if bitcoin does really well for me.
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:05:47
Mine tought it was scam/someone else did it or i didnt know the site was scam. I told her ma´am its nice that you withheld the buy for 2 days but i rather want to buy bitcoin asap as its low atm.

How do you actually pay with bitcoin in a store? Never saw it actually be done before.
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:39:01
Thats exacly what i mean its not practical, while bitcoin can be with mobile apps.
@_date: 2019-11-26 16:25:24
You only have to pay taxes (in germany atleast) if your yearly Profit is over 800€. If i ever come close to that i ask my parents if i can use their Name or my grandparents. Or if i ever get a wife its increasesd by 800€ again.

I mainly use bitcoin to store assets into something the state cant really hold a value of. Also its a great way to get your funds to another country by simply writing the seed code down instead of carrying lots of money around or trust banks with all your assets.
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:08:03
Other kind of risk management. Internet will always be aviable, either via phone or being home on the pc. 
Cash? Imagine you have that mindset while you are in venezuela. Or being in eu and more and more leave the eu and the euro collapses. The only real other option would be silver or gold.

No its the first thing. With silver/gold i can comfortably fight hyperinflation, bitcoin is the same if there wouldnt be the fact that its solely supply and demand driven and the whole system is yet in its early stages and its hard to tell if it will succeed or another coin will prevail.
@_date: 2019-12-19 05:30:20
