Got any good suggestions on transferring all my BC,BCH,ETH ad LTC without fees? My finace and I have around $11,000 combined. CB charged fees when she opened her own CB and I transferred her share to her account, thourgh CB. It dipped a bit before the transfer went through and left $.10 USD in her account because it wasn't enough to transfer. She's bugging the shit outta me cuz she wants her damn dime LOL.

Hey sorry for the late reply but I had to thank you for the well written response. I downloaded Electrum and GDAX so I can make the transfers.
I don't have a lot of money in my cryptofolio but I stared with $180 and it's worth 10 x that with no other buys. I'll have more free cash in a few weeks so I'm going to buy at least 1 full Ethereum and LTC and beef up my BC investment. If what the pros say is true, I should be able to use my cryptofolio to pay off all my debts in the next 2 years and start my business.
Subs like this are the reason I'm a HODLER.
Thanks again.

OK. Noob here. Anyone have a preference towards Electrum? I like that it has both desktop and Android capabilities.
I currently use Coinbase but it really pisses me off when I get error messages, thinking the transaction didn't go through so I try again, only to be hit twice for the same transaction. Not to mention the massive backlog when prices dip. Also, will I get fees for transferring from CB to Electrum?
I'm a HODLer for life and even got my fiance involved. She has more disposable cash and has a fairly impressive BC balance, at least by my standards, considering she just started buying 3 months ago. Now, she's hooked. I thinks it's kinda funny when the last big dip happened a few weeks ago, she nearly had a break down. I had to remind her that 1) She still has far more than her initial investment and 2) BC comes back just as fast as it dips. Someone tweeted "Oh look! Bitcoin is having a Christmas sale!" That was fucking hilarious.
I can't thank this community enough for all the great information and inspiration, even when hard dips occur.

I'm just glad I didn't fall for the hype AGAIN. I'm a HODLer through and through but my fiance is less optimistic. I've had to talk her out of selling several times becuase she sees a dip and gets panicky. I just bought another $1k worth. 
I just have to keep reminding her of the comment I saw on reddit during the massive correction around Christmas. Someone posted
"Oh look! Bitcoin is having a Christmas sale!"
I ain't skeerd.

I'm seeing mixed info on the correction. Some say it will drop below 8k by tomorrow but others are saying the correction is over and that it should spike in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:34:01
I use Coinbase and I made 4 purchases during the drop. Are you saying that none of them went through? If that's the case then I'm fucking dropping CB. This is the second time this has happened when prices fell.

WTF? WHY IS EVERYONE BEING DOWNVOTED?
@_date: 2018-10-04 02:55:01
I agree. I watched the speculation charts grow and fall, bull to bear and back. And every goddamn time someone says "bullmarket run" it's bullshit. I didn't see anyone predicting the meteoric rise of BC back in December but it did. Then fell flat on it's face for the rest of the fucking year. I have a pretty fair amount of money in BC and other cryptos and not one fucking person has predicted with any amount of accuracy what cryptos will be doing in the days/weeks/months to come.
I'm a HODLER but seriously, I wish everyone speculating about what cryptos *will* be doing should just STFU already.

Man, sounds like you really follow the market well. I bought several thousand worth a few months ago when it was below $7k. 
The only thing I regret is selling  $400 worth back in late June last year then seeing it skyrocket in August. That's it. I convinced my mom and friends to buy as well and, now that the price dropped, they are mad at me but I tell them all that if they sell before 2020 it's their fault.
Like I said, I'm a HODLER all the way. I had to sell off a few hundred just a few days ago to pay some bills but beyond that, I'm waiting to watch John McAfee eat his dick. That's gonna be worth the cost of admission.

Why did you sell before the peak? That doesn't seem very savvy. 
This is what I'm talking about. If you had a good understanding of how the system works then you would have sold AFTER the peak to maximize profit then rebuy after it dipped again.
Obviously, no one cansay for certain what the market will do so anything you hear or read is pure speculation without fact.

YES!!!! That's IT! Thank you!

Has anyone else had issues with Instant Buy? I got instant confirmation and balances in Coinbase and Chase last time. Tried it :30 and still not showing up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:50:02
So if Coinbase is so bad, what's the best alternative for buying without the ridiculous fees?
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:36:01
I'm immediately changing my  name to y'all!!!

I'm back to making good money. 
Quick question: I see BCH constantly get bashed. I was lucky enough to have a CB account before the fork so I got some but after seeing all the hate for it, should I just sell it and buy more BC?
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:43:45
I know this feeling too well. My mom, sister and brother are all mad at me because I convinced them to buy bitcoin after I showed them how well it was doing in my account. Went from around $16k to 10 within days. Now that it's still hovering around 9k, they all but hate me.
My mom is HODLing so there's hope for her.
