Yep, well I saw it around 10295 and then it dropped massively. 
Bought a load once it hit 10k, thinking it if it truly does go to 100k by 2019 January then that's 10x the profit!

Agree, don't sell, pretty sure it will bounce up either tonight or tomorrow before it dips massively. I may sell and buy back.

Hit 10300 GBP a few minutes ago.

Thank you.

Will this lower the fees to withdraw/deposit my bitcoin from/to coinbase as GBP/EUR/USD?
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:50:57
 What does this mean? Always thought of getting a Revolut card in the UK to avoid foreign currency fee's.. right time to get one now?

Can't believe no one caught the joke lol 
They must be scared of the recent rollercoaster!

Thanks, so there's no way to set a sell limit order on market values under the current? Wish there was as a backup..

Maintenance. 
No way Coinbase would run out of bitcoin, it also owns GDAX exchange, between the two I reckon they have majority of the bitcoin users compared to any other exchanges, most newbies use Coinbase when they first start buying BTC.

The whole idea of Bitcoin futures will cause a rollercoaster, you have to remember, if it drops sharply, it normally rises sharply too, and vice versa. This is where day trading can really benefit you (at least it has for me recently).

$17906.83 and then it will crash back down to 14k!

Seems like you're trying to make your self feel better dude, no way in HELL I would have cashed out for a measy iPhone, I'd be able to buy a car if I left it there for another ~2 years.

Can't ATM, not on a PC. All you have to do is Google GDAX, click the first link and look at the GBP chart. It will show you th highest it's it today.

Honestly, if you use coinbase to buy and sell, you're doing it wrong. To avoid the fee's, buy and sell on GDAX, it's just as simple to use, and once you're ready to cash out, withdraw through coinbase back to your bank account or send your bitcoin to a different exchange to have withdrawn.

To be fair, I bought at 10100  and it dipped straight after, but I'm in it for the long hold now! Gonna put in £20-50 every week, whatever I can afford, and once BTC hits £100k I'll be good!

I liked it! Nice and quick, and gives you a basic understanding. Good job!
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:21
Ohh, I think due to English not being your first language, I misunderstood. In that case, good job!
