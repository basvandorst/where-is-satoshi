If you’re moving $1 million you care more about a potential 2% swing in price (vs say 5% with a smaller cap coin) than you do about even a $50 fee to be in the next block. Big money will tend to choose bitcoin. One of many feedback loops.
@_date: 2019-07-26 01:15:08
It’s ironic that the best way to do illegal things with money is to use USD. Buying bitcoin with cash is untraceable, but not because of the BTC network, it’s because of the USD network.
Remember this when the government tells you Bitcoin is good for terrorist financing. It actually sucks at this, it’s a friggan public ledger. USD is obviously better for financing terrorism, and they know this. If they want to curb terrorist financing, we should be moving to crypto. It’s much more traceable. 
They have ulterior motives. There’s no good way to explain to the public they’re trying to not lose control of the luxury of printing money from thin air.

You know how the price will hit a barrier a handful of times, and traders will say there is a resistance at that level?

@_date: 2019-07-29 21:25:19
That’s one of many problems that they generally have, yes. 
Altcoins have higher volatility because they have lower volumes on exchanges. Liquidity begits liquidity, so bitcoin is a runaway train isn’t that regard. If you’re going to move $1 million in crypto across boarders and exchange back to local currency, you’re going to look for the lower volatility coin, which has been bitcoin every time for 10 years, so far. 
It’s a feedback loop. One of many.

There would be fewer loans, not no loans. Your money would increase in value as the world economy grows. 
It’s kind of funny it’s hard to imagine a world where people save and buy things after they’ve saved.

Right now we’re at ~3.5% inflation. It will be less than half that in about 600 days. This is what people mean when they’re talking about bitcoin’s rarity. When any other commodity becomes more rare due to reduced supply, the price rises and so then the supply increases as a reacting to the increased price.
Bitcoin doesn’t work that way. The inflation is fixed. We know what it will be next month and 25 years from now, no matter what the price does. As long as people continue to find bitcoin useful, it seems likely it’s going to soar in value for this reason. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:32:31


The difficulty of mining adjusts every 2016 blocks (2 weeks on average) keeping the block reward, on average, every 10 minutes. This is why you can get a fairly accurate idea of when the block halving will be, regardless of what the price does. 


Artificial scarcity with no counterparty is absolutley unique. That’s the breakthrough that bitcoin *is*.


Volatility is decreasing over time. It will need to succeed as speculative commodity / uncorrelated asset class to grow to where it can be taken more seriously as a currency. But in places with currency collapse such as Venezuela, bitcoin’s volatility starts to seem more tame. 


Can you point to a single example of a blockchain that has no cryptocurrency attached? What blockchain is being used more than bitcoin?

Miner revenue will shift from the block reward (inflation) to transaction fees over time. That shift will happen over the next 120 or so years. That hashrate (security of the network) will then be determined by transaction revenue.
The actual “work” of processing trasactions is trivially easy. The security of the network (preventing a 51% / doublespend attack) is what is expensive / nessesarily requires a lot of computing power.
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:42:48
“blockchain technology” is bitcoin. That’s the breakthrough. You can’t do it twice. I realize this isn’t a popular opinion right now, but the bitcoin blockchain birthed digital scarcity into the world. Copying and pasting this scarcity is boring and valueless. And trying to apply blockchains seperate from a currency is never going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:01:28
People find bitcoin useful and / or are speculating on the future price and buy.
People are cashing out, buying shit, and / or miners unload to pay for electricity costs and sell.
These two pressures reach an equlaibrium in the market, and you get the price of bitcoin. 
It’s worth noting that the pressure from miners selling newly minted coins drops over time. This is baked into the protocol through the supply halving. If bitcoin remains useful to people, and adoption continues to grow, you would expect the price to continue to rise like it has been the past 7 or so years. You can also expect continued volatility on the way up as the market gets overheated and corrects (like what we’re currenlty experiencing).

Exactly. And mining using green energy is going to be the most profitable way to mine as the cost of solar drops. If we have a highly competitive / high tech mining industry, they’re going to be nimble to adapt to this change. Much faster than trying to convert the current banking industry over to green energy. 
Plus people act like it’s trivial or easy to change the mining algorithm for bitcoin. It’s never going to happen. It would lead to a contentious hard fork and market confusion because no way everyone would agree.

The better way to think of bitcoin’s scarcity is in terms of inflation. Gold will grow something like 1-2% per year, basically forever (we’ll mine the bottom of the ocean, then asteroids if the price is sufficiently high). If the price goes up there’s more incentive to produce supply so more miners enter the race and more supply is produced until an equilibrium is reached. 
Bitcoin differs from gold here in that the rate of inflation is fixed. No matter how many miners enter the race. So when the price skyrockets in value, there is no increase in the supply of coins produced. The rate of inflation is locked in, currently at 3.75%, but will be 1.8% by 2020, and less than half that 4 years later. 
This is what makes bitcoin uniquely rare. Every other commodity on the planet reacts, creating more supply when the price rises. Bitcoin doesn’t, so it’s subject to insane growth as the supply locks up. 
Couple that with that it’s theoretically a better form of money than government currency (you can beam it across boarders / is programmable and digit from the ground up) and you can see why there are some that think this is going to eat the world.

What I mean is, companies / entities have created artificial scarcity before. We’ve never had artificial (in this case also digital) scarcity *with no company or entity behind it.* That’s the breakthrough. You have something digital, that is finite and you don’t have to trust an entity to control the issuance. That has never existed before.


Yes there was a crazy speculative bubble 6 months ago, but there’s been a history of even crazier speculative bubbles in it’s past. Having trouble finding a more current source that includes the last bubble, but there is a trend of [volatility decreasing]( over time as the market matures. You can’t go from 0 to $100+ billion market cap in 8 years without some turbulence. 


If you gave people the choice between a high inflationary or low inflationary currency, which one would they choose? Would they choose the currency with more inflation because economists say it’s better for them, or the one not being inflated away as fast? 


It’s certainly a start.

These sound like a bunch of buzzwords strung together. Can you give an example? Also why use a crypto currency to do these things? 
I think there’s a lot of blind excitement about blockchains, not acknowledging that bitcoin is currently by far the most useful blockchain (in terms of real world use cases). There will always be niche applications for other cryptos, but if crypto isn’t based on a foundation of scarcity, the whole ecosystem is based on some shakey ground. I’m pretty sure, instead, bitcoin is going to eat the world, including alts.

I think as long as there is a chance of an altcoin dethroning bitcoin there will be value in altcoins in the short term. It even serves a purpose, like litecoin adopting Segwit first helped as a live testnet / this keeps bitcoin honest or it will be replaced. 
In a hypothetical future where crypto has replaced fiat (I know I just lost some of you), the rate of inflation and the distribution of coins are going to be massively important. Bitcoin is miles ahead of the competition and I honestly can’t see how any other coin could catch up.

No, I mean fiat has a higher rate of inflation than bitcoin. Bitcoin’s inflation rate is being offset by adoption. Just by holding fiat, it loses value steadily and predictably. Meanwhile bitcoin is benefiting massively from a migration from fiat’s inflation schedule to bitcoin’s ever decreasing inflation schedule.

Considering if it hits gold market size it'd be $500,000, I think it has the potential to go higher than $1,000,000 if it replaces all fiat. Hypothetically. 
I don't see how gold can compete though, too. Bitcoin will have considerably lower inflation, and relatively soon. All these people panicking about transactions fees, I'm amazed this thing can work without any monetary inflation.

The downward pressure of new supply keeps the market from eating all of the world’s value, for now. The market is still relatively small which lets people write it off, for now. 
It’s baked in that adoption will take some time (the halving is every 4 years, not every 4 months). It allows for coins to be distributed. Hold the fuck on to win the game.

Bitcoin’s inflation rate dropping below fiat’s inflation rate is going to be interesting.

As the rate of inflation of bitcoin approaches 0 / stock to flow approaches infinity, its going to emerge as *the* worlds store of value. The only reason other coins have any value is to keep bitcoin development in check. If things went off the rails something else would emerge (although I think almost impossible at this point).
There’s money to be made still in the altcoin shit storm, but good luck. Personally, it’s not a game I’m willing to play. I trust bitcoin’s moving in the right direction and will never be superseded no matter how “advanced” the next rounds of shitcoins are. This is more about economics than technology.

Major economists (like Paul Krugman) have been predicting bitcoin will fail for at least the last 5 years. They’ve been a lot quieter lately.
Economics is a soft science, like psychology. Satoshi Nakamoto creates a new asset class that adds hundreds of billions of dollars to the world economy over a 10 year period, and people dust off their economics textbooks from the 1980s and tell us why bitcoin’s bad because it encourages saving. 
The housing market is a perfect example of economies being fueled by saving. Diluting the currency to discourage savings just causes bubbles and malinvestment and widens the gap between the rich and the poor.
@_date: 2019-08-14 13:36:25
I love how this conversation comes up every time. 
The price isn’t factored in yet. The supply is downward pressure of miners selling to the market. As of right now it’s still 12.5 coins every 10 minutes. Mining is so competitive (buying up / designing new miners and spending huge money on electricity) that there’s no way for them to not be selling coins to pay for upgrades and electricity (for the most part). 
Also, if the price is already factored in for the 3rd halving, wouldn’t you expect then that it’s high time we start factoring in for the 4th, 5th and 6th halvings? It doesn’t work that way.

Bitcoin is the invention of digital scarcity. Before bitcoin, anything digital could be copied and pasted infinitely, unless there was a 3rd party controlling the supply. Now there’s a digital object that exists that doesn’t need a 3rd party to control the supply. That’s it. That’s the breakthrough. It’s so simple. 
And it’s hard to overstate how big of a deal that is. 
The idea of the value being based on a stock to flow model will continue to gain popularity and will be self fulfilling. Another halving every 4 years. 
You can’t have a supply like that with anything physical without a 3rd party controlling the supply. Bitcoin will win. It’s a matter of time before it eats the world’s value, and things are priced in *it*. Nothing can compete.

That’s not the point that’s being made. Bitcoin’s market cap is still tiny compared to gold. All this fuss about blockchain and crypto currencies and gold’s market cap moves by $250 billion in a day.

It took me a while to figure this out. Generally I don’t want to talk about it anymore, but am pretty sure it’s going to eat the entire financial world in time and make investors stupid rich. 
The people I convinced to invest earlier either tried to time the market and made a small amount of money, but missed the rally and hold very little now, or got mixed up altcoins. 
“Buy bitcoin and hold onto it” is deceptively difficult advice for people to follow.
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:01:27
Nope. The difference is Libra has an authority the Federal Reserve / government can go to and pull the plug on. The only reason bitcoin has been able to get as big as it is is because they *can’t* pull the plug on it, by design.
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:54:18
Possibly more people than use bitcoin right now, yea. 
But bitcoin is also not in competition with Venmo. It’s in competition with the federal reserve. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:19:35
The [google trends data]( is interesting though. This rally hasn’t hit retail investors yet / we haven’t seen much activity from the media. Seems like it’s big money making huge buys more than anything right now.

You can’t have a blockchain without a token / mining / decentralized structure. These things are all interrelated.
They’re just calling a database a blockchain. It’s pretty straightforward. It’s a weird cognitive dissonance where bankers just can’t believe that bitcoin is competing with central banks as a money issuer, but recognize that something big is happening. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:55:28
Yup, spot on with the digital scarcity part. The first digitally scarce asset with no 3rd party backer, and the rate of inflation will approach 0 (stock to flow will reach infinity) in time, *no matter what the price does*. You can’t do that with something physically scarce. If something is physically scarce, and there is demand, the price rises and we make / mine / create more of that thing until an equilibrium is reached. Bitcoin is a digital commodity, so the rate of new supply is fixed, and ever decreasing. As long as there is demand, the price trends toward infinity (replacing fiat). 
Bitcoin is going to eat the financial world. It’s a matter of supply halvings (time).

The market price is reflecting this. It used to trade at 1/10th of bitcoin. Now it’s closer to 1/30th. If you mention this on the other sub they’ll tell you about how the price doesn’t matter, which is bad fucking omen for BCH investors.

What I'm saying is that there's no such thing as a centralized blockchain. It's an oxymoron.
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:11:16
Bitcoin is a breakthrough in digital scarcity. You can’t copy and paste a bitcoin and have 2 bitcoins, and there’s no central custodian needed to be the validator of this, instead it’s a protocol. That’s the breakthrough. There’s no central authority who can gain power over the system. It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal this is to the financial world. 
Copying and pasting all of bitcoin and calling it something else is basically worthless. Investors just haven’t figured this out yet, and it’s temping for early adopters to gamble their winnings on shitcoins.

In addition, there’s an argument for something like litecoin to have some amount of value to prevent development from going sideways. Some healthy comepetition keeps things in check, but I think that will become less and less nessessary as this scales and bitcoin becomes the clear winner.

Yea, I think altcoins are necessary to keep bitcoin in check right now. This is their most important purpose. It prevents things from going rogue because there is competition. That's about it. Any features of altcoins can just be bolted on top of bitcoin, and scarcity is critical to blockchains having tokens that are worth anything. 
Personally I think either bitcoin eats the world's value and becomes the new gold standard in the future, or bust. 0 or 1.

Except instead of weight gain or stocks it a decentralized currency, so your analogies are meaningless. 
There’s a point to be made here. Bitcoin being worth nothing, then being worth something, is kind of a huge fucking hurdle. Digital scarcity is either worthless, or worth everything. Its unlikely to settle long term somewhere in between, as the rate of inflation approaches 0. Some people get what that means, some people don’t.

You're missing the point. The blocks will eventually fill if BCH gains popularity.

I see what you mean now. We’d never go back to the gains seen in 2013, or even 2017. 
But $200 to $20,000 was a 100X run over a couple years. Even a 20X run from here would have a massive global impact. And a 5X run 4 years after that and it’s getting pretty close to replacing fiat.

Maybe because it's the truth?


This person that has the ability to turn the chain off, reverse transactions, etc. They're the owner of a database, not a blockchain. It's really simple. I don't doubt banks are rethinking their data structure and cutting costs, but it is in no way a cryptocurrecy or a blockchain. 
"Distributed ledger technology" is basically a meaningless buzzword used by banks to describe their new database structure, but there is no token, no mining, no decentralization, *no blockchain*. 
It's strange that these banks want to say they're making blockchains, when they're not. It's like a weird cognitive dissonance that they can feel that the ground is shifting and they're reacting, but they don't exactly know how or why.
Anyways, I'm not towing the line, there was no memo. This is basic and most people here apparently agree.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:50:49
I’m bullish on the price long term, but I think you’re interpreting this data wrong. 
Miners just follow the price action. This is more of an indication that miners are becoming more efficient and turning on more units than sentiment of what miners think the price will do in the future.
@_date: 2019-02-21 17:55:39

I feel like this is a misunderstanding of what value is. Yes, it would make the miners of the asteroid lots of money (whatever they bring back), but at the expense of everyone holding gold. It’s a zero sum game. 
Gold is valuable because it’s been a good ledger (for governments/central banks). Ironically, mining asteroids for gold just makes gold a worse ledger.
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:28:28

Right. Stable coins are tied to something that will eventually collapse. All that value will rush back into bitcoin eventually.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:58:44


And if bitcoin has even a niche scenario that drives demand, the value will skyrocket given enough time. 


Unless, of course, the market decides that digital scarcity is a better model than central banking and bitcoin consumes the world’s ledgers. 


Because in this scenario bitcoin consumed all of the world’s value and food, housing, transportation, etc will sometimes be worth more to you than owning a slice of the digital scarcity pie.

Here’s some quick googling:
Gold is something like $7 trillion. 
M2 money supply for USD is around $12 trillion.
Global real estate value is around $300 trillion.
Bitcoin is a new asset class. It doesn’t make a whole lot of sense to compare it to stock, and it will have a better stock to flow ratio than gold and all other commodities on the planet within 10 years. Also, I wouldn’t say bitcoin will replace realestate as a store of value, but it definitely could disrupt that market.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:08:55

It’s not they’re fault, really. Central banks have had a global monopoly on money creation. What else can fiat be compared to? The first time there is a limited supply currency that isn’t centralized (can’t be stepped on by governments) it takes off. Who’ve thought.

Exactly 21 slices.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:26:49
The optimal block size is the block size it is right now. Changing it will cause a contentious fork, which is worse for the coin than any benefit you get changing the block size. Look at what happened to BCH. It split *again* into BCH and BSV because the community could not agree what size to fork to. And presumably, this forking will continue if these coins can manage to remain relevant. 
The solution is in layer 2. We need to work with what we’ve got on layer 1. Because of the scarcity on layer 1, bitcoin is leading the development of layer 2 solutions. It’s layer 2 that will get us to 10,000-100,000+ transactions per second, not blocksize debates and periodically fracturing the community.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:36:49
Bitcoin is a new asset class. The naming convention of things is emergent.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:08:08
I disagree. Fiat will not be able to compete with near 0 inflation and will eventually collapse as bitcoin continues to grow and stabilize. People are going to convert to the money that doesn’t lose purchasing power over time (and it can be beamed around the planet nearly instantly / is programmable / cant be confiscated / is universal / etc). 
If enough people convert to bitcoin, less demand will actually *cause* inflation in fiat, causing it to spiral. We’re not there yet, but we’re getting close. 
It’s weird that people think fiat can’t go away. History repeats.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:43:13
I agree, sort of. The thing is, what if one of these rallies bitcoin gets big enough to rock the currency markets? What if we have the past repeat again, but this rally starts to cause inflation / volatility in fiat because of the money pouring into crypto, even if only for a mania / crazy rally? Fiat is only backed by trust. If the population actually *sees* that it’s only backed by trust, bitcoin’s gains won’t seem so imaginary and fiat won’t seem so real. 
I think it’s going to surprise people when it happens. Fiat and crypto are not going to live happily ever after together.

Traders weren’t puzzled. The price is going higher because there’s ever increasing demand and ever decreasing supply.
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:14:13
Bitcoin will have lower inflation than all fiat currencies in 2020. That’s going to be really interesting.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:22:44
Yup. So far each spike higher has blown through another order of magnitude. It blew past $1 and crashed below, $10, $100, $1,000 and most recently $10,000 and crashed below. I see no reason this rally won’t top $100,000 and possibly go considerably higher.
The wildcard with this rally is bitcoin’s rate of inflation is dropping below fiat and gold’s rate of inflation in the 2020 halving (&lt;2%). If the world is going to flip inside out and shift to a new paradigm, it seems like this might be the rally to do it.

In 2013 it was the Mt Gox hack. Exchanges were centralized points of failure. This hack lead to increasing the popularity of holding your own coins and hardware wallets, and also (which would have happened eventually anyway) a whole bunch of new exchanges.
In 2017 transactions were so popular that there was an acute bidding war to make a transaction and the cost of moving your bitcoins spiked to $50. This lead to the (relative) popularity of competing forks (which keep the core development team in check), and the development of the lightning network, which should solve this scaling problem by making transactions basically free on layer 2.
2019, 2020 might be a privacy debate when governments start to see and react to the existential threat. This could lead to fully untraceable transactions and lead to the popularity of better / more undetectable storage methods.
2024, 2026 Who knows

$1,000,000 won’t be the end game either. Purchasing power could go higher if fiat collapses. In the chaos the housing market will actually correct in a big way (2008 had to bail this bubble out). I think a good amount of the value trapped in real estate is fleeing inflationary currency and will eventually flow into bitcoin. $5-10 million is if all fiat winds up in bitcoin, seems possible it could go higher than that. And would probably have small, but sustained growth as the world economy grows if we move completely to a bitcoin based economy.
Then the aliens will come and take their 5% harvest as they reveal themselves to be Satoshi.

If bitcoin was going to take over the world, all the things you’d expect to happen are happening.
@_date: 2019-04-25 15:12:53
Also the rate of inflation of will be lower than fiat and pretty close (I think lower than?) gold after this halving. Commodities with low supply typically become valuable, and more of it is created and an equilibrium is reached. If the price rises with bitcoin, no new supply is created and we have a culture of holders, so things tend to lock up in supply and the price sky rockets. Then the new supply eventually pushes the price back down to earth. But as the rate of new supply of bitcoin approaches 0, and more and more people believe it’s worth holding until it replaces fiat, it seems like one of these rallies might not drop. It might just cause hyperinflation as people exit fiat and finally read the writing on the wall en mass.
If the world is going to turn inside out, it’ll probably be an “S” curve.

BCH users think they figured out scaling, until they smash into the same wall, and have the same bidding war for transactions with 32MB blocks.
We can’t just scale 32X, 64X, or 128X. We need to scale 1,000-10,000X, which can only be done on layer 2. BTC is winning the race to get us there. Devs obviously understand the game theory involved. A lot of users do not.

There's was 4 bubbles in the first era (50BTC block reward), and 2 bubbles in the second era (25BTC block reward). It's certainly possible to have multiple bubbles after a block halving, and this bear market does not feel like 2014. 
I don't think it's going to take 3 years to get to an all time high. I would guess 12-18 months. But honestly, who knows. I generally don't make price predictions. Although I do think bitcoin is going to eat the entire financial world given enough time.

To your oringal point, you were arguing gold has inherent value and bitcoin does not. I am arguing bitcoin does have inherent value. 
If there is a limited supply and market demand to serve a purpose, this is how anything gets “value”. 
Consider that both bitcoin and gold have legitimate demand, and yet only bitcoin has an ever decreasing rate of inflation. This is why despite the negative sentiment on this thread bitcoin is up 700% year over year. Gold is not doing quiet as well.

Bitcoin *is* a universal basic income. The sooner you realize this, the more you will be rewarded. 
As a bitcoin maximalist, I believe bitcoin is going to eat all of the world’s value in time. When this happens, the value of our currency will increase as the world economy grows. People living paycheck to paycheck will earn slightly more each week as the world GDP increases. Our currency will be an investment in humanity. Contrary to popular economic belief, I think this will be increadibly good for the economy. 
But honestly, it doesn’t matter *what* people *think* will happen with a deflationary currency. The dominoes are already in line, and its a matter of time before bitcoin becomes our standard of value.

BCH forked off of BTC August of 2017 as a simple but crude fix to allow more transactions per second. The market has chose BTC over BCH as a better scaling solution by over 10:1. Now there is infighting in the BCH fork about how to scale further. BCH is about to fork into 2 today, BCHABC and BCHSV. They’re competing versions of BCH, and last I checked the market is giving them fairly equal value, but still only 1/20th of bitcoin’s value. 
Honestly it just adds more confusion to “bitcoin cash” (aka BCH) and makes it even more irrelevant than it already was.

Nope. They were spamming the network to drive up the cost of transactions in an attempt to move people to BCH or otherwise hurt bitcoin adoption. What they inadvertantly did was get the community excited about second layer transactions to avoid $10 on chain transactions. As soon as the lightning network was up and running the spamming stopped. There might only be 4btc of value there now, but if the cost of transactions rises again the amount of value on the lightning network will grow exponentially.

Bitcoin isn’t about replacing trust in banks, it’s about replacing trust in central banks. There’s no reason you couldn’t have the same consumer protections banks have in bitcoin as the market matures, if you chose to use a custodian for your wallet. 
One of the major advantages of bitcoin is your money doesn’t get inflated out of existence over the long term. And for now the value is rising quickly as adoption is far outpacing the inflation schedule of bitcoin. Meanwhile holding governemnt currency is a guaranteed 1-3% loss compounding annually.

I’m with you in that the halvening is a bigger factor in the last bubble than anyone is giving credit. Next halevening is very interesting in that the rate of inflation will be lower than gold or any fiat by 2020, but it might take until 2021-2022 for the market to really wake up to this in a big way. 
But the nature of bitcoin is that either the rate of new adoption falls off a cliff and bitcoin fails or the value of bitcoin approaches infinity (in theory / assuming only hodlers holding and rate of new adoption remains the same or higher) as inflation approaches 0. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:32:54

Do you really think if people had *more buying power* because their savings wasn’t being inflated away, people would spend *less* than they do now? Bitcoin is going to challenge this narrative, but also, even if true, which currency do you think the average person would choose? Would they choose the currency that loses value every year for the greater good, or the one that gains value ever year because they’re acting selfishly? 


You are missing the point here. All those checks and balances are in place because these banks have to trust that the transaction actually went through. If the world used bitcoin, these banks could see the transaction on the blockchain. It mitigates the trust from banks and clearinghouses to the public ledger. Buy and hodl.

August of 2017 a group of people created a new coin using bitcoin’s open sourced code, but implemented a different scaling solution. The market chose bitcoin over bitcoin cash 1:10, in that bitcoin trades approximately 10X higher. You’d think that would imply bitcoin had the better scaling solution based on what the market decided. But there’s a group of people trying to claim that bitcoin cash is actual bitcoin and that bitcoin is called bitcoin core. I would argue it’s a social attack on bitcoin that bitcoin is fending off.

You can’t understand bitcoin by reading headlines or a couple of articles, so yea, most people have heard of it but don’t yet understand it. 


So are you saying bitcoin is dead because of the recent pullback? Look at a long term chart, it’s had a history of larger pullbacks and has roared back higher something like 5 other times in 8 years. Even these same arguments against it and conversations come in waves as it spreads.


Bitcoin was never meant to compete with PayPal, it’s competing with central banks. It needs to establish trust (gain value) as something like a commodity first. As it stablizes and matures, in theory it could be an amazing form of payment with programmable, instant, near free, immutable, boarderless transactions. The Internet was kind of lame at first as well. If you think you’ve seen peak bitcoin, I’m on the side betting your wrong.

Somehow I don’t think people in the western world having more buying power will turn us into disciplined savers and grind the economy to a halt. We’ve experienced products falling in value over time in different industries for it to benefit both the industry and the consumer. And there’s also a good argument to be made that inflation distorts the value of investments, causing bubbles like home prices and stock prices by incentivizing undue risk, destabilizing these investments.
But that honestly all doesn’t even matter to the argument here. Even if a deflationary currency was bad for the world economy but good for the individual, individuals would make the selfish choice over the altruistic one. It might just be the “dystopian” (although I think not) reality that we’re hurtling toward.


For most in the first world, PayPal or credit cards make more sense for spending for now. But as long as there’s legitimate use cases where bitcoin is better, like remittances or purchasing from companies credit cards refuse to deal with, the price will rise as adoption continues / the supply locks up. Hodling is absolutely a speculation, but its basically a bet that there won’t be something better than bitcoin for those use cases as adoption spreads. Altcoins would be the most obvious threat, but bitcoin has a massive head start with its network effects / larger market cap and liquidity adding stability vs altcoins. 
On the surface bitcoin absolutely seems like a speculative bubble or mania, but when you really dig in, something big is up. Central banks and governments speaking positively about “blockchain technology” (whatever that actually means) and the financial world no longer laughing at, but admitting this seems to be something that’s here to stay, it’s getting hard to write of as fad or tulip mania. 
You don’t have to believe me, or pay any attention if you don’t want to, but I wouldn’t expect it to go away either. It’s either going to be a strange footnote in history or this is the beginning of the internet fundamentally disrupting the financial industry. It’s hard to overstate how big of a deal that might be to society.

The last bear market hit $150. That was only 3 or 4 years ago. 
It seems like we have an oscillation between higher highs and higher lows over time, because the supply is fixed in spite of the price. When people are selling, the supply doesn’t let up due to the price dropping. The flip side is that when the price is rising, supply doesn’t increase as most commodities would. Instead the price skyrockets. 
This is going to turn itself around and will never make it close to the previous bear market cycle, would be my guess. It’s done it like 5 times in 10 years, maybe more.

I believe large miners would prefer to sell off-exchange so they don’t tank the price / large buyers buy off-exchange so they don’t cause the price to slip higher as they’re buying.

You can hedge your bets, but I don't think it's going to be necessary. The clear  coin, Ethereum, isn't even capped in supply, and in 25 years will still have ~5% inflation. Meanwhile bitcoin will have lower than 2% inflation in 1 year.

My thinking was, say you have 1,000,000 people buying $100 worth of bitcoin every month for the price to stabilize where it is currently at ~$4,000. If the rate of new supply gets cut in half, the price rises, regardless of what's going on with the outstanding supply. 
To your point though, if between halvings say you have 3 years of exactly 1,000,000 people buying $100 worth of bitcoin every month, with the same supply, the price would trend lower because some amount of purchased bitcoin from previous months would end up back in circulation. 
I guess I'm assuming a large percentage is buying and holding, waiting for other applications to become more useful as this grows and stabilizes. 
Good catch though, I can't say the price will rise if demand remains exactly constant. But there is certainly something interesting about how easy it is for the price to rise relative to any other commodity because of the ever decreasing rate of new supply regardless of what the price does.

ETH hasn’t even cleared up it’s rate of new supply. It’s not a serious competitor longterm if it’s not capped. And the fact that the network is going to have to make such a fundamental decision puts the whole thing on a slippery slope. 
I agree competition is good, especially in the short term to keep bitcoin’s development honest. But ultimately ETH can be ported on top of higher layers of bitcoin. The reverse (especially the supply aspect of bitcoin) is not true. 
And the later any coins enter the game, the harder it is to balance distribution of coins with the rate of supply of new coins attempting to approach 0. First mover advantage is enough.

Doesn’t matter. As long as there is cash and internet there will be trade in bitcoin. And as long as there is *some* regular increase in demand, as the supply of new coins approaches 0, the price of bitcoin trends toward *infinite dollars* (as in collapse of USD). 
It’s way too late. They’re literally over a decade too late to stop this. All they can do is pass legislation to make it difficult to buy bitcoin (but not impossible) and allow other countries to buy up the future’s wealth. If they were smart, the fed would be buying up bitcoin as reserves to remain relevant. 
This is a force of nature that 99%+ of people still don’t really understand. Sanctions and limiting people’s freedom with their fiat will only be gasoline on the fire.

This is the real reason to get your crypto off of exchanges. 
A ban of bitcoin will do nothing but push the US behind other countries. The way to win the game is to encourage your citizens to buy bitcoin to bring future wealth into your country.

Pushing it out of the country is not the answer. Buy and fucking hold.

First mover advantage is everything in this market. It takes time to distribute coins and it takes time to have the lowest rate of new supply. New coins can’t have both. 
I would never expect demand to stay exactly the same. That was to make a point about the nature of the supply. In fact, demand is growing as the coin matures and stabilizes.

What changed since 2017? Great fucking time to buy. The market can’t float this high without getting smashed down by new supply of coins, but the rate of new coins is going to halve in 2020 (and every four years until forever). The rate of new coins entering (think inflation) is going to drop below 2% in 2020. No. Matter. What. The. Price. Does. Then it’s going to halve again in 2024.

You’d need a unanimous decision from all world governments to do this. And even then it would only slow things down and push it off maybe a decade as the rate of new supply approaches 0.

This is fun! What’s your predicion for the end of 2019? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:16:58
You don’t need much demand at all if the supply approaches 0. You only need a single niche application driving demand. I think we’ve already got a few (remittances, buying drugs online, self fulfilling store of value (this is circular, but it’s true), it’s become the reserve currency for people who trade gift cards, I’m sure there’s more). 
There’s demand, and as things mature and stablize, there’s even more demand. But we literally don’t even need more demand long term. The supply is the really exciting part. If demand stays exactly the same over the next 100 years, the price will rise. Nothing else works this way. 
As for an altcoin / perfect competitor overtaking bitcoin, that’s going to be extremely tough. Bitcoin now has a 10 year head start of distribution and is the most stable crypto with the lowest rate of new supply. And if you’re going to use a coin in such a volatile market, you’re most likely going to choose the least volatile. Liquidity begets liquidity. Bitcoin was the breakthrough in digital scarcity, altcoins copy and pasted that code. Bull markets breath life into the altcoin market because bitcoin holders got rich and want to “diversify”, but those markets starve and crash hard during bear markets because seemingly all of their demand is trying to find a better store of value than bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:05:25

Sort of. I think most would agree, a modest block size increase would be a reasonable thing to do. The problem is you’ll have to hard fork and if the community isn’t unanimous, a minority will spin off with their own solution. You risk fracturing your community in order to “upgrade”. BCH fractured off of BTC over the block size debate, then BSV fractured off of BCH because they couldn’t agree on *how big blocks should be*. Presumably those coins with fracture further. 
Instead, the block size will be kept small, and solutions will work around using small blocks extremely efficiently. The solution is in layer 2 anyway, and BTC is winning the race on layer 2 due to constraints on layer 1.

If white dog shit was *even a marginally better* means of global transfer for *a single niche application* (like, I donno, say remittances) it would become more valuable. The difference though is if white dog shit became worth $10 people would find a way to farm it, increase the supply and drop the price back to earth. Bitcoin. Does. Not. Work. This. Way. **It is the only commodity on the planet where the rate of supply is completely independent of the price.** That means if there remains *even a single niche application* driving demand, as the rate of new supply approaches 0, the price will trend ever higher. Dare I say infinitely higher. Like eat the entire financial world in time higher. 
The only way the price falls to 0 in the long term is if it has absolutely 0 advantage in any application. Even just as a collectible. This is the most obvious bet in centuries, maybe longer.
