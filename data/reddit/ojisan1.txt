Exchangeable for fiat is not the same as pegged to fiat. 
Pegged means the exchange rate is fixed. 
The exchange rate (bitcoin price) fluctuates based on market conditions, because it isn’t pegged.

These are just basic investing terms nothing specific to bitcoin. 
Read up on investing. 
If you’re just hodling, you’re what is called long, and any bullish news is good for you because a bull market is when it’s rising. 
If you were betting against bitcoin, you’d be short and bearish news would be good for you because a bear market is when it’s going down.

B) the bike may be a light form of trolling, but it’s not hurting anyone 
C) banks do all kinds of crappy things - from censoring people, to robosigning foreclosures, to opening safety deposit boxes, to money laundering for terrorist, there’s plenty of reason to hate on specific banks, like HSBC or Bank of America, that might not apply to other banks your local credit union.

Whoa whoa whoa. Mind = blown. 
These contracts do not require delivery, they are all settled in USD! That changes everything. So they literally are betting on the market without participating in it. 
So my premise was flawed. But my conclusion seems to be supported for different reasons. This should be a stabilizing force on bitcoin prices in USD, just in time to counteract the flood of new buyers, and will provide some insurance for miners (which is exactly the origin and purpose of futures contracts, to provide insurance for farmers and other commodities producers in volatile markets).
For every question, there is an Andreas video.

My first job invoked using one of those mechanical credit card machines. 
Place the card on the machine, lay the two-copy slip with the carbon paper on the card, satisfying *ka-chunk, ka-chunk* as you slide the handle back and forth once across the card to take the imprint, take out the card and slip for signature, tear off the top copy, one copy to the customer and one copy to the slot under the cash register. 
That’s how people bought gas for their cars in 1990. And 30 days later, the receipts would finally make their way through the system, and the gas station would get paid from the credit card company for the gas I sold a month prior. 
We didn’t wait for confirmation. There was no modem to call and confirm the cardholder had funds. We just took an imprint of a card on a hand-written receipt, and you were on your way - the customer didn’t sit for 30 days in the parking lot and wait.

I just watched an Andreas video someone posted here where he explains that fully. My mind is blown and also I feel much more bullish about tomorrow!
Based on this info, it seems like short pressure will probably cause the price to go down in the short term, but long term the futures market will help stabilize prices and provide insurance for miners who have the most risk in the current environment. 
This seems like great news, do you agree?

@_date: 2015-06-06 15:36:01


Yeah but it's only us tech geeks and anti-establishment types who are really worried about that. People are pretty used to this concept and don't mind it. 
After all, you don't own your dollars in a bank account either, and people use banks all the time. They trust it, partly because they believe in the FDIC (which they probably shouldn't). I think companies like Circle who are trying to have more mass appeal recognize this, which is why they have insurance for your coins they are storing. And unlike banks, Circle isn't going and betting your money in the Wall Street casino. 
Personally I think people in the mainstream will become comfortable with companies like Circle with insured accounts, just as they are comfortable (despite the evidence that they shouldn't be) with bank accounts backed by the FDIC. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:24:58

I'd like to see that feature, if I have a BIP32 passphrase somewhere (on a piece of paper, in another client, or whatever) that I want to be able to use via Copay, it would be great to be able to enter the passphrase and be able to access the wallet from Copay, even if at that point it converts it to a BIP45 HD wallet and creates a new recovery key.

When it's a purely technical issue, yes.

Sorta. [But if your mail gets filtered through an antivirus or anti spam gateway that touches the headers, for example, the message won't be recalled.]( If the recipient organization doesn't store messages on the server but instead downloads them to the client PST/OST file, or mobile clients on non-Windows phones, it also won't work. 
Message recall is a wonky feature that has *never* really worked, and gives people false hope. In most cases, the recipient simply gets both the original email and a second email stating "so and so would like to recall the message XYZ" which only calls *more* attention to the offending email in the first place, the *opposite* of the intended effect. I know as soon as I get a recall request my first thought is "ooh, maybe something juicy! Let's see what they wanted to recall!" :)
Let's say recall works for 50% of the recipients (I'm making a *very* generous assumption) and for the other 50% it results in the attention-grabbing result. Was that really helpful, to you the sender who wished he could take it back? Now instead of most people ignoring the email, at least half the people are now paying *extra* attention to it. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 09:45:40

Why would it? 
@_date: 2014-07-24 00:47:29
I disagree. The real solution is to escrow the funds and only release them when the event happens. That way if the event doesn't happen, these crooks wouldn't get a dime and there would be no need to deal with a 3rd party to do chargebacks and lawsuits and all the rest. Plus, if the company folds and disappears, chargebacks aren't going to work anyway.

Which again, I can't prove or disprove this, but it seems like an awful lot of effort and I don't know how large the string is that MSE is looking at. If it's a 10-bit string then the odds are pretty good that the block hashing algorithm would spit that out every 16GB or so. 
@_date: 2014-06-20 15:40:48
It wouldn't take long. If the dev decides to do something nefarious, it'll happen quick and be over. And once you move the coins into a wallet, and move them again, they're not going to be traced too easily to recover.
And it's not paranoid, the temptation of a big payday is hard to resist for some people. Why is it paranoid to think that someone who has access to large sums of money might not misuse that access?

Well, it would be nice to have the option. Coinbase is enabling it as an option. Perhaps a tap to toggle, between bits and BTC?
@_date: 2014-07-13 06:13:34
Very true! Actually, I read in wikipedia that Zimbabwe [hasn't had an official currency since 2009](  They use a bunch of foreign currencies - dollars, euros, rand, rupees. 
So, then the issue with answering this question would be that it's going to be nearly impossible to figure out how much foreign currency is floating around the country, to know what the impact would be on BTC if they traded all those currencies for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-20 03:56:46
Even if the coinbase blog announced it, it's not their app. They can say they verified the code but this dev could change it any time he wants. 
If coinbase wants people to use their service with a potentially-risky 3rd party app, well, that's their reputation on the line.
@_date: 2014-05-16 20:15:15
Yes they should, but this is replacing one such service (credit/debit card) with another, lower cost one. And, where do you think your money will get a better return, stored in an insured Circle wallet where the value of bitcoins can go up over time, or in a fiat currency bank account, where the interest rate paid is not enough to account for inflation?
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:08:44


That's a good argument, although I don't know if I would be ready to take such a risk as a merchant. 


I don't know if all I said was true or not. Fact is, there's relatively few places that take either bitcoin or litecoin, so it's all theoretical. We'll see what gets widely adopted in the future. Will crooks get good at double-spending and confirmations become more important as the use of bitcoin becomes more widespread? I don't know, but it seems possible.

That all makes sense. 
Feature request though, bits isn't the most useful denomination. I'd like to be able to select other denominations. Especially since bits isn't commonly used. The ATM machine doesn't tell me I have 200,000 pennies in the account if I have $200. Having 200,000 bits to denote $60 isn't so helpful either. Maybe someday bits will be common, and BTC has gone up 100x in value, but for now it's just one among many denominations and none of them are truly standard.
Thanks for the reply!

Security question - full nodes probably shouldn't be run on machines that are acting as wallets, right? I'm thinking that since being a full node advertises your IP address, and you've opened a port to that machine, you are a target for attack like any public server and if you have a wallet on the same machine, you have something of value worth stealing on it as well. Yes? No?

No because MC/Visa don't act as escrow agents. They are a payment system. MC/Visa pay the vendor on your behalf, and you get to pay MC/Visa back later. An escrow agent would literally hold onto the money so neither the buyer nor the seller has it, until the conditions of the sale have been final (in this case, after the event happens). 
A chargeback is MC/Visa coming back to the vendor up to 6 months after the sale and saying "you know that money we gave you for so-and-so, way back when? We need you to give that back to us now".

This serves to illustrate, more than anything, how unsophisticated a "pattern matching" antivirus software is. If it spots a file that has a string that matches a string in a list of known viruses, whether there's actually a virus there or not, it thinks it's found something.
The virus signature in question here is 25 years old. The code still can exploit Microsoft's OS? Maybe, maybe not. Nobody checks. The antivirus pattern databases never remove anything, AFAIK. They just keep adding more strings to it as people create more viruses. 
I think the OP's idea that someone deliberately added this to the blockchain is unlikely. What seems likely is that out of 16 GB of hashes, random strings of data, a string that looked like something MSE has in its database was created by a legit hashing function and triggered the false positive. It was bound to happen, and due to the unsophisticated nature of pattern matching AV, it is bound to happen again in the future.

Forget all the complicated answers with installing apps and all the rest. Just go with bitpay, that is the easiest way to get started (if you were in the USA I would say coinbase, it is the equivalent here). 
You can always learn more about it later and try other approaches, but bitpay will give you the least opportunity to mess something up when you are just starting out. My dad is 70 and just started using coinbase for his small business this week!
With apps you have to know about security, and backups, and other stuff. With coinbase or bitpay you just have to know how to use a website, email, and and your banking account.

So? If a million people end up using the app and they all set that to 0.5 BTC, at current prices that would mean an approximately valued heist of up around $300M USD.

Worth noting that a new "tipping economy" is developing on the Internet. We can see it to a certain extent in micro transactions being used in services like Mechanical Turk, where you can pay small amounts of money for small coding projects. 
But it's really taking off among the younger generation, and this is most evident on Twitch.TV. There are teens and twentysomethings making decent money providing entertainment for tips (mainly via PayPal). With twitch now offering Dogecoin tipping, the idea seems to be gaining popularity as a good use of cryptocurrency. 
Since more people have bitcoins than dogecoins, it seems logical to me that bitcoiners would naturally start engaging in this new tipping economy as well, just based on the fact of its popularity - the demand to be able to tip is out there. 
One of the examples of how different experiments in innovation can happen in altcoins, and if those ideas are successful, they can be integrated into the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
I'm happy to see changetip taking off. I think it also makes for a nicer, more engaged community here on @_date: 2014-07-05 20:41:02

I don't know enough about bitpay, I thought it was similar to coinbase (which allows you to buy bitcoins with dollars and store them in a hosted wallet). If bitpay can allow you to buy bitcoins with Euros and expands that to include Yen, as long as they have a local banking presence in Japan that would fit the need. 
Right now as far as I know, the only way to get bitcoins for Yen from a Japanese bank account is ANXBTC in Hong Kong, but they take 0.05% for exchanging one to the other, and charge ¥2600 plus a half percent of the withdrawal amount to send Yen to your bank in Japan if you sell BTC.

Yeah but this ad left out a lot of stuff. Like how the government can confiscate your savings at any time, freeze your assets, or just refuse to give you your money if you aren't willing to provide a justification (for large cash withdrawals). Or how they will discriminate against certain legal businesses in response to political pressure, spy on their customers and datamine your spending habits for marketing purposes. And how overleveraged a lot of banks are, having insufficient capital reserves to cover a run on withdrawals.
Lots of stuff they left out. ;)

If that's the case, you let the guy develop it, he submits the source to your in-house team, who then submits it to Apple under the company's dev account, not the outsourced writer's account. Then and only then do you have control over the app, as well as the update process.

It's not out yet, I just checked. But assuming it's on its way, this will be fine for now. Being able to *use* bitcoins in a Coinbase wallet from an iPhone would be just enough (barely) to keep me from switching phones to an Android device. Being able to buy/sell would be even better, but I can do that from my computer (or my web browser). I feel like as bitcoin becomes more widely used, eventually reality will catch up with Apple and they'll allow it or risk losing too many customers. I think they are being stubborn because they would like to have a way to make money off of this, but that might not be possible unless they are going to offer a way to convert USD to BTC themselves. No self-respecting bitcoin market will give Apple a cut of their fees, they have to keep fees low to stay competitive.

Agree with everything you say except for bitcoin versus fiat buying power. 


The longer you hold *fiat*, the greater the risk with regards to its future buying power. Fiat inflation is an almost certainty, almost everywhere. Bitcoin deflation is an almost certainty, yes with short-term volatility, but future buying power? Let's call it a 50/50 chance, that's still better than the 99% chance those fiat bills in your wallet will be worth less in the future.

What Apple did for digital music, they are going to do for digital payments. And that is good for bitcoin.
Apple's going to do more to help drive mainstream bitcoin adoption with this Apple Pay, even if it's unintentional. It's going to prod retailers to upgrade their payments systems to support NFC, and as bitcoin mobile app developers start to take advantage of NFC, that might be the thing that makes bitcoin go mainstream.

Reading this was as visceral an experience as the first time I read Satoshi's white paper. I feel like I just read a proposal to build SkyNet, but instead of it being evil and trying to destroy humanity, it is neutral and would be a reflection of us - good, bad, or indifferent. 
I would love to see what would happen if we replaced a city government with this type of system. Maybe this is how nation-states will govern themselves in some distant future - rather than send "representatives" to some far off capital city, you represent yourself, via a blockchain, and all decisions are made by participation in that system. 
I don't know, maybe it turns out that this is unworkable, but it made me think there are amazing possibilities behind this.

My guess is that they are more easily able to monetize the marketing data gleaned from traditional payment methods (Apple and Google use the credit card system on the back end) versus Bitcoin where it's much harder to tie your transactions to your marketing profile that they can then sell.

The value of the coins themselves will stabilize over time and that will erase that perception. MTGOX did a lot of damage, by inflating the price so rapidly that it appeared to many people to justify their fears of bitcoin being a pyramid scheme. But that will be forgotten eventually.

When someone is talking about Bitcoin in a philosophical sense, as OP was doing, it really doesn't matter which coin is being spoken about. Bitcoin in that sense means a decentralized blockchain, it doesn't make any difference to OP's argument whether you use the actual Bitcoin, or DarkCoin, or Dogecoin, or whatever. 
If you want to use a cryptocurrency with a smaller user base, or some specific technical feature that is important to you, or any reason for using any of the myriad blockchain-based technologies being developed, the principle is the same and so would be the sociological impact of the cryptocurrency idea.

Yes it shouldn't be about ideology. When I talk about bitcoin, I talk about 5 aspects of it:
1. it's currency, which can be invested in like dollars and yen and rubles or even gold and silver
2. it's a commercial payment system, like Visa or MasterCard or PayPal, but without risk of chargebacks, and very low fees for merchants
3. it's a person to person money transfer system, like western union or mailing someone a check, but nearly instantaneous, with very low fees, and works anywhere in the world
4. it's a store of value - you can be your own bank and store money on a computer, or on a piece of paper, or on a thumb drive, or on a smartphone
5. it's a mechanism for advanced financial instruments/transactions - like crowdfunding, derivatives, escrow, and other stuff that people haven't even realized yet
If the person is naturally anti-bank they will realize the implications of points 1 and 4. If not, then the other points might be more relevant to them.

It's not the breakthrough we're waiting for but it's a huge step. When an everyday brand starts accepting bitcoin then we'll finally see the dam burst.

Common error - what's at issue here is the inflation and deflation in the *supply of money*, not the effect of monetary inflation and deflation on prices which is only the secondary impact. 
Since the supply of Bitcoin is known and finite, even though the supply is currently increasing, it's limited and time-bound. So in the long term it's not going to inflate beyond the maximum amount. On the other hand, fiat currency is being printed which inflates the supply of fiat, and there is no limit on the increase - irrespective of the effect of that inflation on prices, the supply of fiat is inflationary, and has been for a long time, by the intention of the central banks. 
It's also worth noting that the inflation of the fiat supply has resulted in price increases, but those price effects have so far been limited to certain sectors of the economy - mainly in stocks and in the derivatives markets, not in the price of an iPhone or flatscreen tv.

But the USD amount is wrong too. If it's satoshis, it still should only equal about $60 - no matter what multiple of ten, if it's mBTC then it would still have to be a multiple of $60. 
Edit: .01 BTC = 100,000 *u*BTC.  (Is a lowercase ~~b~~ the symbol for bits?) So that part kinda makes sense if it's in "bits", although I'd prefer to show the balance in an easier to use amount (an ATM doesn't tell me I have 200,000 pennies available in my checking account). But the dollar conversion is waaay off.

The problem with his rant is that he is putting his faith in regulatory schemes to fix the problem. That's like saying if we just had the right criminal laws, we could prevent all crime. 
The problem is not a regulatory scheme that will magically be "proactive" in stopping fraud. 
The problem is a banking system which is a protected and entrenched banking oligarchy, combined with the inevitable fact of regulatory capture. 
The solution (of which this presenter seems to be unaware) is free and fair competition to the established banking system, which Bitcoin offers by letting people be their own banks.

Well since you're talking about the price of the currency, and its value with respect to other currencies, I agree with you. 
But I think that most people when they talk about "inflation" think about increasing consumer prices, which Wall Street will tell you isn't happening because the CPI isn't increasing rapidly. But it's easy to see that just because CPI isn't rising very fast, doesn't mean we haven't massively inflated our money supply, and it doesn't mean that hasn't created bubbles of inflated asset prices elsewhere in the economy outside of the things measured as part of the CPI (such as the stock market).
The bottom line is, inflation helps producers and borrowers, deflation helps savers and consumers. With rising inequality, I think we need to be doing more to help savers and consumers, I think producers and borrowers are already getting more help than they should via monetary policy. So I think bitcoin and the deflationary aspect of it is very beneficial to the 99.99% of us who are trying to save and buy things we need, versus the 0.01% of us who are borrowing money to buy up stocks and real estate and driving those prices up.

[According to this article]( Ver is actually in a dispute with OKCoin over the bitcoin.com name, they did some shady things to Ver, and OKCoin was responsible for the horrible site redesign?

The answer to the question is always "no". You are never carrying bitcoins, they live in the cloud. You might be carrying the key to spend those bitcoins, which is an entirely different thing IMO. 
If I'm carrying a trezor that has $10000 in Bitcoin, am I carrying $10000 in Bitcoin? I would say no, for this reason - if I had memorized the HD wallet seed phrase, I am no more "carrying" those coins than I would be if I had memorized my checking account number and bank routing number.

That may be the only upside to the most recent bailout - it'll give Greeks one more chance to cash out their euros for Bitcoin and other assets before they are frozen again or they experience a Cyprus-style "bail in" aka confiscation of savings. 
The most recent bank shutdown *would* have been the last chance, if the Greek government had decided not to pay ball with the ECB and instead dropped the euro for the drachma. But it did put a scare into people and show them what could happen if they keep putting their faith in banks and governments. 
So this is encouraging to know at least some Greeks have awakened to the real danger of fiat.

The simplest wallet for a beginner, one that I recommend when I want to demonstrate to someone the power of Bitcoin, is Breadwallet for iOS or Mycelium for Android. Usually the first lesson is, "ok here I'm going to send you two dollar's worth of Bitcoin". The second lesson is, "ok now send me a dollar's worth of Bitcoin back". That demonstrates wallet receive addresses, QR codes, and the idea that value can be exchanged peer to peer with very low fees.
Tell me how that's an advanced topic, when all you want to do is have $1 or $20 worth of BTC to play with just as a newbie?

No, I’m not saying that at all. I’m saying in developed countries, it’s a luxury, in developing countries, it’s a necessity. It’s useful in both. 


How do developing nations become fully banked? Not industrialized, that’s different. You can have industry and no access to banking. Do developing nations want a system with the same problems as the developed world? Why did many African countries adopt M-pesa? Because the path the first world took is not the only path. 


Um, once the unbanked become banked with bitcoin, then you have 3 billion daily users. Tell me again about how that comes crashing down.

I’m not going to say you’re wrong, because I don’t honestly know. Chronos Crypto on YouTube explained it pretty well. 
I say that segwit makes me nervous, but that’s not me saying it’s definitely bad. Your comment makes sense, but miners start mining before they even get a block sometimes, which is how we end up with some empty blocks, no? So doesn’t this further incentivize skipping the verification step, as small as it may be, to be first to the block reward? And if that block gets accepted into the longest chain, then those unverified transactions can’t be undone. 
Edit: and it’s not just the time cost of downloading the signatures, it’s the time cost of verifying the transactions. 
Edit 2: here’s the video that led me to the article. I admit, I understood the video a lot better than the article.

Andreas Antonopoulos explained this quite well. Paraphrasing: Greeks cannot buy bitcoins if they do not have cash. If they have cash, they do not need to buy bitcoins. 
The problem is the capital controls prevent both the acquisition of cash and the transfer of banked money to an exchange. So yes, this is a pure PR move by these companies since there is no one who could take advantage of the 0% fee right now.

Just because OP can’t buy a cup of coffee with it doesn’t mean it’s not useful for payments.

People in the first world with stable money and easy access to credit don’t *need* bitcoin in the same way people in the developing world or in unstable countries do. 
Here, it’s more of a speculative thing, and a technology interest. 
Zelle works fine if you don’t mind being subject to the censorship of the banks, their fees, and their rules. I use a credit card every day for the same reason. 
Zelle doesn’t work if you don’t even have access to banking. Zelle doesn’t help you if your country’s currency is inflating at 1000%. Zelle doesn’t work if your country has capital controls preventing you from exchanging with the outside world. Etc.

Looks like someone else decided to tip just now, another transaction just added. But for anonymity it doesn't make sense to put 2 BTC into a wallet using the same public address as you're asking for tips with. (I assume it's the wallet owner who put the initial 2 BTC in, because that's a mighty generous tip otherwise.) 
So he's gotten 0.005 BTC in tips, roughly. Not that much money but it's a good idea regardless.

Appreciate the effort of creating this guide, but I think you should seriously reconsider the advice you're giving with respect to wallet choices. 
Putting Coinbase first in your list of wallets is a huge red flag. If you're going to trust a 3rd party with your wallet, at least Circle accounts are insured. But Coinbase and a Circle are better thought of as on-ramps to the Bitcoin universe, I wouldn't leave my money in either one. The biggest risk is that the government decides "no Bitcoin for you" and it all gets seized like what happened with Silk Road. Or they get hacked. Or they just decide to run off with your money (not likely, but it could happen).
Breadwallet should be on the list for sure, plus an Android-based wallet. And blockchain.info has had so many problems I don't know where to begin with why that's a bad suggestion. 
I didn't get past chapter 1 because of this list. You would be much better off referring to this list on the Bitcoin.org website:

If you are serious about helping, then you should consider offering 0% to countries who are *about to have* a bank liquidity crisis, not after capital controls have been implemented and the people's accounts are locked. 
Give 0% trading to Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain, so they can move their capital before the banking system stops them from accessing their money. Help them to prepare for this eventuality, not after it's too late.

Yeah it's cool that you are getting the word out about Bitcoin! I am a big uber fan and if I ever see a QR code I'm going to tip just on principle. 
However - You generally will want to use a new QR code for each transaction. Since your QR is posted more or less permanently, you obviously can't do that, but you'll want to use a separate code for tips, versus any other purpose. Not a big deal, we're all feeling our way through this technology as it develops. But you might want to generate a "tips" address with a separate QR code and make a new sticker every so often. That way nobody can do what we just did and snoop your tips.

This isn't meant as an advertisement, but Circle makes it reasonably simple, considering there are regulatory hurdles outside of anyone's control in the Bitcoin community. Plus it's insured. 
I like the idea of pre-paid Bitcoin cards but haven't seen them anywhere, ever. Maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough. 
Then, once you have bitcoins, the question becomes what do you use it for? There aren't too many retailers who accept them, so what else can you tell people?
Bitreserve.org is an interesting concept, use your bitcoins to trade in foreign currency markets and precious metals without a forex account. Another reason I would give is to just hold some BTC as an alternative hedge against a currency collapse in your home country. And for remittances, if you have relatives overseas. 
The last part is storing your BTC. As an iOS user, this was an issue for a long time. But Circle's app is pretty decent for accessing your online account and buying BTC with a bank account. Breadwallet is great for spending and storing smaller amounts of BTC locally rather than trusting a third party to store them for you. 
I agree that it's not easy for first time users, nor is it obvious why they should bother trying in the first place. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:36:27
But nothing says you have to give over your Bitcoin to a bank or exchange. You can keep your own private key and thus keep your money yours, and yet still use it for electronic transactions. Unlike the current banking and payments systems, which require you to give up control of your money in order to do electronic transfers (or pay huge fees to do cash-equivalent transfers, such as via Western Union or PayPal).

You’ve got it completely backwards, mate. 
Inflation means inflating the money supply - more dollars in the world means each dollar is worth less. Deflation means reduction of the money supply. Fewer dollars in the world means each dollar is worth more.

Even if you think it’s done being volatile, inflation is still a thing.

And they are only needed because people want to convert to/from Bitcoin and other forms of money or assets. Fiat currencies, altcoins, equities, commodities, etc.

Or by not doing business via institutions at all. In a bitcoin economy, giving control of your assets to an institution will rightly be seen as a credit risk, and you will expect to be compensated accordingly. If you do not think the compensation (interest paid) is a good deal, you do not have to give control of your assets to any institution, and you can still participate fully in the global electronic payments network and hold your assets yourself via your private keys.

Same is true if you hold fiat currency. Even the almighty dollar loses value. Just slowly. But if you hold Venezuelan fiat, or Kenyan fiat, or if you held dollars in the 1970s, you'd have the same issues of price unpredictability. Not sure why you think this is a bad thing about Bitcoin. For a system that's only in place for a few years, it's had a few bubbles and price spikes but it's been steadily increasing in value if you look at the long term trend. It's only going to get more stable over time. 
And you only "lose money" if you sell it when the price is lower than the average price of all the times you bought Bitcoin. 
Your video game example, if you only ever bought BTC at $500 and all you did with it was buy something when the price was lower than $500, sure, you lost a bit in the transfer of that $50. If that's the way you're operating, you can wait to buy your game, you can buy more BTC to bring your average cost down, you can buy the game with fiat instead of using BTC, you can accept the small $5 penalty "loss" for buying a game with BTC after buying BTC at a relatively high price. There's lots of ways to look at it. 
You choose to see it as a bad deal, if that's the case then don't do the deal.

True, but it connects the Bitcoin ecosystem to the mainstream merchant payment ecosystem in a relatively easy and transparent way. Is this better than direct Bitcoin payments to merchants? Hells no. 
BUT - if you want to bank with Bitcoin and still spend your money, this allows you to hold your savings in BTC instead of fiat using a regular bank account, and *that* is a step forward in the self-banking realm. 
It's a step forward to getting more people to use Bitcoin on the savings side, even though this isn't a step forward on the merchant payments side. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 21:50:27
The point is that once you identify the owner of a wallet, you can trace all the transactions for that wallet on the public blockchain. Unlike cash, where once the money changes hands you have no way to trace it back to its source. 
The key is to not be identified as the owner of the wallet, that's where you get your anonymity. But in an anti-terror investigation, where a terror suspect is being monitored and warrants are issued, etc, the blockchain keeps a perfect record of who did what.

Not even saying anonymous. You have to give your address to get something mailed to you. But they have to keep all that personal data on file due to legal record-keeping requirements, which is a security issue.

@_date: 2015-10-27 15:46:57
I agree overall with what you're saying but for me the issue isn't as much anonymity as it is security. I accept having to show ID at the liquor store to buy a case of beer but they don't keep my ID on file. California requires dispensaries to keep customer state-issued ID's on file, which is a nice target for identity thieves. 
The thing that attracts me to Bitcoin as a payment system is the security. Rather than having to give my credit card number to a merchant, the merchant has to give their Bitcoin address to me. The worst case scenario from a credit card is someone runs up a bunch of charges against my account. The worst case scenario with Bitcoin is someone puts money into the merchant's wallet (not a bad problem to have).

If most of your money is in dollars and you're trying to live off it, you have less buying power when the price goes down. You don't need to exchange to BTC for it to be "lost money"
