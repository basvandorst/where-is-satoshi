Mainstream media comparing charts. Bitcoin looks identical to bubble chart. Lots of FUD going around. But bitcoin chart has always looked like the bubble chart for example China FUD. Instead it blasted to new highs. 
What you guys think?

it can only be a store of value if you can buy things with it. if you can't use bitcoin to purchase items then how does it have any value? making payments fast and low cost will make it a greater store of value because more examples of bitcoin being used to purchase lambos and mansions will occur, thus people will equate bitcoin = lambo / mansion = store of value

If this thing goes to zero so be it. It was a fun ride. But I'm going to hold just in case it blasts off to 30k just to rub it in all the FUDers. That's priceless.

Yes you are right. There is no guarantee of it being a store of value and nothing in life is guaranteed except death and taxes. But if you believe in the technology of crypto you choose your horse and hope you're right. Or if you're smart you choose many strong horses.
Forks happen all the time look at all the alt coins, but consensus is what creates value and the consensus right now is BTC.

Is there anything that can be done about it? Unregulated market so I don't think any laws cover this. But they'll happily tax you for crypto gains!

Binance, Bittrex that I know of. Kraken too I think. Read up more before making any big decisions. This is just my opinion aka speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:49
i see is at an investment only. would you go around paying people with gold? it doesn't make sense to use it as a currency when the price of it could sky rocket at any moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:44:11
If it wasnt for bitcoin transactions taking so long, you could make a killing arbitraging from coinbase even with the huge coinbase fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:39:46
yes it's called arbitraging. but bitcoin transactions take a while so it's risky

I read an article the other day about some guy getting kidnapped and robbed for his trezor. Had 2 million in crypto on it.

They are trying to shake the weak hands for cheap coins before the inevitable pump. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:12:06

Get rich or die trying

Also they added Ether, LTC and Ripple to Bloomberg terminal. More fuel for the speculation!

Welcome to trading! lol

Coinbase adding new crypto in Jan. I think Ripple will be on Coinbase. Average Coinbase user will see under $1 crypto. What do you think will happen? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:16:06
What do you think will happen first, LTC reaching $1000, ETH reaching $2500 or BTC reaching $60,000? Putting $500 right now in one of these will triple if those goals are hit.

Quadriga has lower fees so it kinda evens out but right now noobs are getting ripped off. So easy for the whales to put up fake walls and cause stupid emotional buys. You can watch it in real time lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:31:49
Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. Bitcoin has existed for less than  9.
The stability of gold actually makes it a better method of payment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:19:13
LOL. Mortgage another house. Sell all your belongings. Ask the bank for loans. Ask your family for money. Sell your kids Xmas presents TODAY. Put it all in bitcoin RIGHT NOW. This thing gonna hit $1 billion a coin tomorrow. I know this because tomorrow is Christmas and Santa Clause is coming to town. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Don't miss the train. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:04
Look at the futures. They are setting up it perfectly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:09
aka they don't want a massive dump and need to prepare the whales to manipulate BCH to stay high
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:01:54
Does anybody know if Quadrigacx will support the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:54:40
oh hell no i would never. Thanks for the tip though. people should take note
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:33:58
segwit2x. people say its a scam coin. but they said that about bcash and bcash worth 2400 usd now. so i want my free coin regardless
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:14:18
Yah there could be, but seeing as its a deflationary asset with a set limit. Supply and demand guarantees the price will increase. 
However, you are right in that BTC will only have any value if more examples of it's purchasing power continue to occur. The paradigm shift starts with people seeing BTC being traded for mansions and lambos consistently. When the time comes where I can reach my goals with the BTC I have then I will consider using it as a payment but for now I don't have enough BTC yet and I think it has a lot more to go.

Coinbase makes money on fees on transactions. They would want to add a legitimate crypto with high volume. Based on volume and market cap, BitcoinCash looks like a good candidate. But maybe Coinbase will not want the confusion between BCH and BTC. 
Dash NEO Monero QTUM IOTA yeah it's all speculation lol. But I think Ripple is the best candidate due to its MC, volume, and business connections.

I love the bitcoin futures. Gives a way for the people to really fuck over the shorts. If everybody holds this thing collectively. We can squeeze the shit out of wall street for betting against bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:29:34
Never used it but heard terrible things

On Quadriga, people are paying 18.5 CAD when on the same site its at 13.7 USD which is about 17.4 CAD. It's hilarious.

mmmm boxing day would come early
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:29:43
The chart is not pretty. It's looking more and more like bulltrap, but who knows with bitcoin. It does whatever it wants and defies logic.
