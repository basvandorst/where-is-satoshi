IQ is effectively useless because if you have a high IQ, no one will believe you. Even Wikipedia says identifications over 130 are likely errors in testing. Basically this means that there is no reliable quantification of intelligence above "pretty dang smart". Maybe it's better that way, but if you ever test at an IQ &gt; 130, there's no benefit had by owning up to it.

For the vote to matter, you'd have to have a semi-significant amount of hash power. Even *if* people wanted to pay for the right to contribute to the network consensus, there's no way any normal person would be able to afford it. In fact, most relatively "wealthy" people wouldn't be able to afford it. It's strictly the domain of the mega-rich, meaning the type of people who spend $80 million on luxury yachts because they're bored and don't know what else to do with themselves.

Because it *wasn't* that way before custom ASICs were developed. My opinion is that Satoshi didn't foresee the creation of special order mining hardware that only a handful of people would be able to access. To the extent that he foresaw new mining hardware, I think that he thought it would be a commodity product and that people could spin up mines like they spin up datacenters. Since the hardware is not for sale, you have to either develop it yourself or just opt out.
The massive dependence on network consensus that Satoshi falls back to several times obviously indicates the expectation that power will be distributed among the masses of bitcoin users, not a cabal of a 5-10 men at the very top. How is that any less centralized than the system we have today, where the Federal Reserve and executives at the nation's 5-6 largest banks set the rules?
In practice, bitcoin's design has proven not to be resilient to power consolidation; that is, it is not truly distributed. This basically comes down to the combination of the way the network handles difficulty and the simplicity of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm that makes it relatively easy to design specialized mining hardware.
btc has always been a prototype, and at least personally, I never expected it to hit mainstream success in its current format. But it has been a super intriguing drama to follow, and a great learning experience.

If you can tell me how to do this and get a positive ROI without spending millions on R&amp;D and production, I'm all ears.
The people who make mining hardware are going to keep the hyper-powered versions private, because as soon as they release them to the public, the difficulty would skyrocket again and everyone would become unprofitable. Instead, they'll just use that hardware to mine coins for their own use and avoid affecting the network's difficulty.

It's inevitable with SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm (which I think Satoshi chose basically just 'cuz, and altcoins like Litecoin saw the error and switched to scrypt hashing to limit the potential influence of people with superpowered hardware). It didn't have to be inevitable. In theory, even this could change and the network could vote to switch to a different algorithm, but as the miners with the most hash power have dedicated millions of dollars to R&amp;D and production on specialized SHA hardware, they're obviously not going to go for that.
Bitcoin simply does not have the adequate controls to keep the power democratized. This is obviously not something that Satoshi foresaw, since he assumes that the community will have authority to make decisions in the best interest of bitcoin by voting with their hash power. Now, a tiny cabal controls the destiny of bitcoin because they had access to large quantities of specialized hardware that the general public didn't.
Only way to fix this is to commoditize good mining hardware, but don't count on this to happen any time soon, since there's more money to be made in keeping that hardware close to chest and hoarding the hash power than selling commoditized units for a couple hundred bucks a pop. Maybe what we need is a big drop in the value of Bitcoin so that people are encouraged to sell the hardware to the public.

He's saying the community failed because it worked in concert to prevent users from learning about XT and choosing for themselves whether they wanted to run a node or not. The community also punished people who "voted" for XT by launching massive DoS attacks on them.
Hearn is not claiming that the community failed because his idea was "rejected". He's claiming that the community failed because it refuses to tolerate polite dissent, does everything possible to deprive end users of the information they need to make a fully informed decision, and then does everything possible to punish users who have expressed the alternate opinion.
While that sounds broken to me, I also recognize that it's not much different from any other venue or community. The people in charge control the narrative. As someone with the propensity to step down and over-democratize, I've learned that if you're in that position of power, you should appreciate it and stay there.

Self-laundering takes a lot of work and forethought to make it appear credible. There is definite value in something like this. The coins shouldn't have to be insured so long as Torwallet is used as a transitory store. Of course, I guess mixing can't really happen if no coins are kept on the server. I'd be interested in hearing more about how the founder deals with this and exactly what kind of logic is used to move the coins around.

Litecoin is just bitcoin with saner settings, as I said. I definitely think block generation every 2.5 minutes is superior to generation every 10 minutes.

BTC also depends on a huge support structure to be worth anything. Many gold standard people are trying to hedge against a *major* economic collapse; they believe the Federal Reserve is a sham and that our dollar will also tumble into worthlessness. Such an extreme crash may make internet and/or computer access much more difficult.
Under those circumstances, bitcoin will be worth almost nothing. If most of your savings is in bitcoin when a crash of that magnitude occurs, you will have some difficulty convincing someone to trade your printed btc private keys for food.
Meanwhile, gold exists in its entirety in physical space. It is imperishable and does not dependent on support structures like ISPs, telcos, power utilities, etc. When dollars aren't worth the paper they're printed on, gold is the likely fallback token of exchange.

Bitcoin is too much. It's unwieldy and difficult. I think it's an important experiment, but I don't believe btc will enter widespread usage for several technical reasons that make it impractical for everyday use by everyday dudes (e.g.: double spending, 51% attacks, block generation speed, block chain size and requisite download (yes, I know about the split), etc.).
I think litecoin has saner defaults for everyday use but I further think that we need a different architecture altogether. Bitcoin has shown us the opportunity and possibility, and bitcoin will probably continue to have its uses, but a slightly less cumbersome bitcoin-esque platform that provides the features merchants really need (like instant validation of funds and instant platform usability, perhaps simplified currency exchange and permeation) has much better prospects of entering widespread use.

Value relative to what? Is a dollar compared against itself? Who decides how to quantify a dollar's value? The forex market? I can assure you that the forex markets fluctuate all the time, and prices never move because of it.
Bitcoin is a dollar proxy, because all anyone cares about is the current exchange rate.


What do you mean double? Where can I buy a Bioshock Infinite key for the standard price of 0.75 btc? afaik it's difficult to find Bioshock Infinite keys with prices denominated in bitcoin, period.
Not everything has to be defined by the current price on MtGox.
@_date: 2013-04-05 02:10:05
OK, so if one feels that way, why reward bitcoin buyers? If I don't care about btc and just want dollars, I *should* charge more for btc transactions because they come with the requisite overhead of conversion into a currency I actually care about, *and* the user gets additional utility (pseudo-anonymity) so they'll likely be willing to pay more anyway.

It sounds so ridiculous to think that things like the internet will go undisturbed when "revolution is at hand".
FYI, if a stray rodent can chew through some wires and drop your connection, a civil war is going to be much worse. And people aren't going to just politely leave the local internet connections intact -- that is a fundamental resource for the enemy.
Networks will still exist in a post-collapse society but they'll be local and ad-hoc, most likely based on wireless mesh. Bitcoin *may* be partially feasible in this scenario (though in reality it becomes seriously fractured and your keys would all have to be pre-collapse, before each segment got its own pool of peers and forks (and remember that a 51% attack in this scenario would be simple)), but unless you expect a totally non-violent "revolution", I wouldn't count on the infrastructure upon which bitcoin depends to stick around.

Lots of people acquired bitcoins when they were incredibly cheap, either in exchange for other currencies or via mining. For them, if they buy a Bioshock key at 1.5 btc, even if it doesn't match the exact current dollar:btc ratio, they're still way ahead in terms of the amount of labor expended or value delivered for that particular product.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:16:39
Maybe not for everything, like the guy who started accepting bitcoin at his car dealerships, but there are plenty of practical applications right now if people snap out of speculation mode and come back to reality. Bitcoin offers real utility and makes it easy to perform trades that would be difficult with other systems. Focus on that stuff.

DDOS could have something to do with it. Are you familiar with their infrastructure sufficiently to know that they have an alternate, unaffected channel for submitting withdrawal info? One superficial explanation may be that they don't want to risk any of the outflow getting lost or bogged down or otherwise tangled up in the effects of the DDOS. I'm sure it would make things a lot messier if the withdrawals subsystem were affected negatively (for instance, the ACH submission may get queued, but the database update could time out, resulting in bitfloor giving you free money -- bad for everyone concerned with the solvency of their exchange). Perfect engineering would make such a problem impossible, you say? That's cool, but we don't live in a perfect world.
Another superficial potential explanation: bitfloor is busy keeping itself alive so that people can place or cancel orders and don't accidentally have a limit buy order execute while the price falls precipitously. Lots of people were pretty upset about this happening with mtgox the other day. Getting $$$ in and out of the account could quite understandably be lower priority.
I agree a tweet or something would be nice, but there's only so much time when you're fending off major DDOS attacks. I also don't guarantee anything is this way, and I agree it is possible that bitfloor is trying to steal your money. I think it's unlikely, though, and think we should just try to remain calm right now. There's a lot of panic going on in the btc community, and we need to keep above it if we're not going to ruin ourselves.

Do normal people sit around thinking about the volatility of their dollars? Do the prices at McDonald's fluctuate daily based on forex markets? Price changes do occur occasionally but they're not pegged to the exchange rate of an alternate currency -- they usually have to do with real factors, like reduced supply of materials. Prices adjust for inflation gradually and rarely.
Bitcoin is a dollar passthrough right now. There is little to no mentionable internal market. If there were, people could set prices and they'd have some modicum of stability, at least. Something that costs 1.5 btc today would still cost 1.5 btc one, two, even THREE!!! weeks later. The fact that this doesn't happen proves that bitcoin does not have any hold as a real currency; as I said, it's just a payment processor, until people care less about the dollars and more about the bitcoins.
On that note, selling a Bioshock Infinite Steam key for 1.5 btc. Takers please PM me.

Yes, I'm aware, but HipHop has a small team in a company filled with devs, most of whom are very capable and very smart and spend a good deal of their day writing code in PHP.


When you're at Facebook scale, anything is going to be "shit performance-wise".


I also use C++ and C regularly (not occupying major contract positions right now, however), so no need to stay mounted on that high horse. I've written code that is now in WINE, Linux, WebKit, and other open-source projects.

Bitcoin is not a "good investment" if you are poor. Like it or not, the cash-poor must forgo lots of investment opportunities because they don't have the spare liquidity to convert into tangible assets. As neat as it is to have bitcoins, it's even neater to be able to go to the grocery store and buy food and pay your landlord rent. If you make minimum wage and dump all your money into bitcoin, there's no guarantee it'll appreciate immediately and you've risked quite a lot on btc speculation.
Remember that those who bought in in Summer '11 had to wait until like last month to have their coins appreciate. *It can happen again*. Don't let your fanaticism blind you to reality. "Never invest more than you can afford to lose", even in the supposed economic panacaea of deflationary bitcoin, and especially when it takes more than a day of wages to purchase a single bitcoin.

I tried to use Dwolla as a primary payment processor for certain clients earlier this year and the experience was quite bad. They are completly unwilling to share anything regarding FiSync, they offer nothing else unique. The transfer times are ridiculous. They are just a silly UI on top of a classical bank experience (all monies are held and processed by Veridian Credit Union in Iowa), with typically terrible customer service and general uselessness. Dwolla sucks even for normal money, I'm sure it's worse for bitcoin.

But that's not relevant to the parent's argument. You can use a custom runtime/JIT/static compiler/whatever, but it's still written in PHP, which the parent says is a problem because it "attracts the most minimally competent developers". Facebook's use of HipHop is the same as NewGuy1's use of the stock PHP runtime. Someone smarter wrote that code, and they just consume it.
The fact is that while you may get a lot of bad resumes for a PHP position, you aren't required to pick the bad programmers. Lots of great programmers work in PHP all day, every day. I say this as a programmer who works primarily in Python and C and has been doing a lot of hiring/interviews recently.

It depends on your motives. Typically it's called "speculation" when people buy into something real expecting it to go through the roof and be able to cash out a return. "Gambling" is when you put up money and don't necessarily get anything back for it; money is risked and lost essentially instantaneously and the gambler has no good in exchange. When you buy bitcoins, you get bitcoins, which have real utility beyond speculative forex to some people.
I first bought (and mined) bitcoins when they were less than $1. The real btc userbase watches this whole procession with amusement, because our usage of btc is not wholly dictated by the USD x-rate.

Just the other day I got downvoted below threshold for telling a guy who makes minimum wage that it might not be smart to dump all his savings into btc at this particular moment, reminding him that bubbles do pop, and that those who bought at the peak of the hysteria in summer '11 hadn't made their money back til last month.
One day later, the market "crashed". Heh.

Right, the last few days were a major crash. But you and I both know that the bitcoin peg to the dollar didn't just start two days ago. The default option with bitpay is to set your price in dollars and allow the system to automatically convert it to bitcoin based on the real-time x-rate. That's bad news for merchants. If you want stability, you need to decide, "OK, I will let this go for 15 btc", and recalibrate against the currency exchange markets infrequently, and buyers need to say, "Well, I know by today's x-rate I could get $90 of value for these coins if I sold on currency exchange markets, but I'd rather buy this good with my bitcoins than convert them to dollars and buy in dollars".
Is this realistic? I think it's realistic for the markets where bitcoin has real benefit over other currencies.

I don't know as I don't use either one! But that's not the whole story. If you have to maintain accounts at *both* CCBill and Bitpay, that's additional overhead for bitcoins. If you don't care about bitcoins, there needs to be some justification for the administrative complexity two merchant accounts introduces (like integration of bitpay into your shopping cart, additional verification procedures, keeping recent information on file, etc). The raw rates of your accounts at these processors aren't going to reflect total cost. Perhaps you can argue bitpay really is the best dollar payment processor, but then those "bitcoin is the future" guys might want to come to terms with reality: the only reason anyone (for significant values of "anyone") uses bitcoin is dollars.

If people price their goods in bitcoin based on its independent value and not as a dollar proxy, it makes it a lot easier to maintain confidence even when the currency markets shift.
