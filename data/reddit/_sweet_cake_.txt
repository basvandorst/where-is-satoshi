Have fun buying more!
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:20:16
well, that is not looking pretty
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:11:41
Nope 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:26:39
BTC is going to get F*CKED real good by Wallstreet in a matter of days now anyway... Y’all should seek refuge in alts now... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:34:14
Hope you guys sold a few hours back, now just enjoy the show!
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:27:15
I have done that yes! Better than most movies when there’s traffic! 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:01:55
If you diversify you should not have any big losses as you’ll always have at least one coin doing fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:35:17
It's barely started! They'll short for sure, be patient!
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:19:43
YES and NO
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:31:10
I’m French and this is full of shit. I made a account lately with N26 that is, and the debit card going with it, completely free. I’ve made dozens of transfers to Coinbase and i even get the money the same day now during working days. 
Keep your French account for utility bills and wages and set up an account on N26. You won’t regret it! 
Edit: je peux te parrainer je crois, ça nous fait un petit bonus si jamais tu fais un compte en banque. 
En tout cas jette un coup d’œil à N26. Je suis à l’étranger très souvent, ils te chargent rien pour les paiements par carte partout dans le monde et te prennent un pourcentage ridicule pour les retraits hors UE. Je suis super content d’avoir transféré la plupart de mes sous vers cette banque. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:13:00
yes, if you want to, it is! not everybody can afford 1 BTC nowadays. As long as you hodl...
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:20:13
What on Earth is going on you folks?! Drunk dance!
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:21:00
BETTER THAN SEX
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:10:11
set buy orders!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:51:00
a little late maybe... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:04:35
HODL my man! Don't give away your $ to these BS whales!
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:39:29
Coinbase my man. Often down during moonshot but fees aren’t that bad! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:21:58
If you sell now, you can buy back at 1K less, but it's a bit late to sell tho. Just sayin
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:20:53
it is a CORRECTION; nothing abnormal here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:37:57
i reckon you need another verification for Gdax, you can add it in coinbase. Such as ID and Passport, or License.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:44:17
This is going down to at least 12k maybe lower 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:21:55
oh yes! By far!
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:23:24
You guys should sell this Saturday. Wait for Futures to short BTC and buy back in!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:28:37
You mean on Gdax?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:52
yes, it is a healthy correction. We are avoiding a big bubble and a horrendous crash.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:00:45
Hodl my man! And diversify if you wanna add more money!
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:37:29
volume doesn't match. You'd need more volume around the head and less around the shoulders.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:07:40
Yes! Works all fine! Saves you loads of fees.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:57:14
If people who bought high panic sell. It is possible yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:01
I sold all a bit before the big drop and am now waiting to buy back my fav alts at a discounted price, not a bad day here! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:39
haha, and it's not done yet!
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:56:49
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:46:57
goddamn 18k wall
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:11:56
You'll be alright!
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:52:26
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:11
CRASH hihi!
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:51:05
Agreed. Gdax fucked up here. Btrash seriously...
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:21:44
Let's see in 2018, when BTC will be stabilize by futures! See you then!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:21
Price is higher so bottom might around 12k 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:20:39
it won't always be this way
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:50:40
my man!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:17:34
don't do it... that is ridiculous...
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:06:06
Binance. No verification required. I'd advise you to buy asap as it may never really hit this price again ($4.25 as of now.)
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:04
there it goes
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:56:04
If people get scared and panic sell in mass yes
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:01
Yup 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:00:05
nah, nothing official now. It's being tested. Security matters above all, so it might take a while before it's considered all fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:41:39
Bottom should be between 11.5/11.8k (regular, non Gdaxed price)
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:28:37
On short term you’re f*cked. On long term you should survive that with a smile ��. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:51:41
such a piece of shit of a coin...
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:10:05
17k ish
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:10:39
HERE WE GO, CORRECTION TIME FOLKS!
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:23:09
will be better when lightning is up and running!
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:02:36
Of course! You won't own these $ anymore, you will own BTC, LTC, ETH, IOTA etc. If it goes up, it's worth more $, if it goes down, it's worth less.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:34:50
buy, hodl, make profit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:34:13
That’d be insane... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:55
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:25:26
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:37:55
yes, it is a healthy correction. We are avoiding a big bubble and a horrendous crash.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:51:34
i mean it's much less if you use Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:43:42
with some beautiful shorting that'll make all weak hands sell.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:25:58
we'll all be dead by then.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:05:38
Yup, time to set the ladder!
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:29:02
don't buy right now, it's been going up steadily for hours. Wait for a good dip.
