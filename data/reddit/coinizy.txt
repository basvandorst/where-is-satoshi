Blockchain experts... are already busy working on Bitcoin : )

Well, bitcoin *is* literally at the top

Can't wait the day when we will be able to do this... using a big bank ATM. Banks weren't able to offer a "withdraw gold" option from ATMs as it would require incredible logistics, but the "digital gold" option can be set up in a few hours and doesn't need fort-knox like security : )

Cryptograffiti basically did what we call a spoof ad/trademark hijacking. The tactic proved to be very useful with the Bitcoin vs Western union meme back in the old times

Hey, I knew we would eventually agree on something pal : )
@_date: 2016-11-02 23:57:05
Totally agree. Did you look at the picture though? The sticker doesn't make any reference to fiat : ) 
@_date: 2016-11-03 10:54:41
+1. Would be really interested in getting those as well.

Our friends over WeUseCoin actually have an excellent tutorial to get started:  
Once that she is up and running with her wallet, I would definitely suggest Coindesk guides, as they cover many practical areas:  
Ps: Kudos for onboarding your aunt into bitcoins! We need more age/gender-diverse people in our community : )

Close enough buddy! M-Pesa is based in Kenya, where it gained huge traction (68% of Kenya's GNP goes through it!) Anyway, Bitcoin is the ultimate form of (mobile) money so we won't have to wait too long until it gets replaced by BTC : )

You might want to check the 16 pages of overall positive reviews we received, then:  : )

Yep, it refers to the amount of silver "above ground" i.e already mined. But we didn't mine yet the 21M bitcoins either, so... fair enough comparison : )

Hey there!
I would definitely recommend our friends at [Bitmarket]( as they support Elixir instant withdrawals to your domestic PLN bank account :)

""On the 13th of December, the Ponzi Scheme announced the freezing of all members' accounts due to systems overload and the negative attention brought on by the Government and mass media,[9] leading to wide spread panic in the Nation and even attempted suicides." 
Gov. authorities in the Western World should definitely take similar measures regarding OneCoin, this won't end very well either...

Here’s a way faster alternative: You can register on [coinizy]( and order a virtual VISA debit card that will be instantly delivered to you. You can then use your brand new card on Amazon : )

You might want to use your Australian debit card on Purse.io (Buy an Amazon Gift card using your CC and sell the gift for Bitcoin on Purse..)

Thanks for the kind words :) Here is the exact quote of our cards' issuing bank regarding this specific situation: 
"The fee will be charged to the Card account even if the balance is not sufficient at the time of processing the fee. In this case, the Card balance will be negative until a load transaction is received on the Card.
If the Card does not receive any loads for 3 consecutive months and the balance remains negative, the Card may be closed at the discretion of Wave Crest. The negative balance due to the uncollected Monthly Maintenance Fee is not pursued from the cardholder when the Card is closed."
Btw, I just realized this is a great question likely to be of interest for other customers so we will add it as a Q&amp;A entry by the end of the day.

Fortunately enough, there still exist exchanges that don't care whether you use your coins on LBC, OpenBazaar or some gambling site, while allowing you to use their services without any verification whatsoever as long as you stay below the legally-required limits. Virtual debit card provider [Coinizy]( is one of them : )
@_date: 2016-09-24 12:38:15
Hey there! Coinizy founder here. We just launched a giveaway campaign on bitcointalks so that you can try our card for free:  It already received a fair chunk of reviews so you might want to take a look :) I can also confirm Ledger CTO's claim, so you have a sort of double-guarantee here ; ) 
*Edit to address the 2FA question* : At this time, we offer an email 2FA for card loading and settings modification: simply set your security setting to "Enhanced" by visiting the settings page. We also plan to integrate the good old mobile Google Auth 2FA by the next few weeks.

Hi, [Coinizy]( founder here. I might have a cool alternative solution: we provide virtual debit cards available in 144+ countries and that don't need any kind of verification up to $2500. If you would like some assistance from our side to help this great idea get off the ground, let me know by PM or drop us an email at help : )
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:41:43
You're correct. But you know, even in Western countries, buying Bitcoin using fiat currency is a real pain...

Coinizy founder here. We're offering [instant issuing, legal and fully manageable virtual VISA cards]( that can be funded using Bitcoin... We sell these cards 0.50$ (and still make a good profit on it) so is there anyone who can explain to me why on earth would you buy stolen cards, for a (probably) higher price?  
@_date: 2016-10-12 22:12:47
Really cool project. A P2P currency like Bitcoin with a mostly P2P industry such as freelancing is a match made in heaven.
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:02:37
Coinizy founder here (We provide [virtual VISA debit cards]( that can be loaded using bitcoin) Actually, the fees we (Coinizy &amp; competitors) charge are mostly linked to the FX operations we have to perform (BTC to USD) and the card issuing bank's fees	 (You can thank VISA for that) Hope this helps!

Cannot agree more with this. Do you know how people from Vietnam, Morocco or Venezuela used to shop online or accept payments from international customers before Bitcoin existed? 
They weren't able to. International payment methods such as bank wires or credit cards (Amex/VISA/Mastercard) were only available for the top 0.1% of the population in these countries. 
So no Amazon shopping and all the perks that come along (Free shipping, Fair pricing) for them, who were coerced into using the local monopolistic retailers owned by their governments.
Bitcoin is enabling all these people to join the global e-commerce village for the first time since Internet appeared, and we're very proud at [Coinizy]( to take part in this revolution by enabling these bitcoin-owning populations to shop anywhere using our instantly issued virtual VISA debit cards : )
@_date: 2016-10-10 11:32:24
Sure there is: Coinbase released a very nice widget a few weeks ago to enable bitcoin startups to accept credit cards... and get credited in Bitcoins. Have a look: 
Ps: Feel free to pay us a visit at [coinizy.com]( should you want to get an instant-issuing virtual VISA card that you can fund using your hard-earned bitcoins : )

During peacetime too, actually : )
And central banks are precisely being more and more sensible to this...

Excellent news. As far as I know, Bitcoin has gained traction in all kind of remittances:
- The traditional one, where people living in rich countries want to send funds back to relatives living in emerging countries: [Rebit.ph]( and [Korbit.ph](	 now represent 20% of this traditional remittance segment in their respective area of operation ([ Sorry for your loss, Western Union!
- New type of remittances, where people living in emerging countries would like to buy items on e-commerce websites located thousands of kilometers away. This wasn't possible for a very long time since getting a credit/debit card is incredibly difficult here, but Bitcoin virtual debit card providers such as [Coinizy.com]( or drop-shipping services such as [Purse.io]( are bringing International e-Commerce to these populations.

Hey there!
The card is issued by a Gibraltarian Bank: WaveCrest Holdings Limited (All bitcoin debit cards providers are using the same one, for the simple reason that this bank is the only one to accept bitcoin startups at this time)
In principle, the card can be used anywhere VISA is accepted. There are exceptions though: some merchants like the US Itunes Store, for example, may require that you use a card issued in the same country (in this case, the US).
