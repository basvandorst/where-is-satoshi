go to coinbase &gt; purchase bitcoin/fraction &gt; get a wallet (blockchain etc) &gt; transfer bitcoin from coinbase to wallet &gt; sit back and watch the world burn.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:34:44
no worries, it can be confusing.  like the 1st reply stated, blockchain is the tech behind bitcoin...and there is also a wallet named blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:20
get in now so youre not saying the same thing when it hits 140k...?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:25:11
its the bank.  you call them and tell them its a legitimate purchase youre trying to make, and they will send it through.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:19
best 'advice' ever.  thank you for your solid contribution.  instead of putting money into bitcoin, ill put money into cash.  ...
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:12
think of how many people said the same thing when btc was at $900.  look at it now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:31:28
which is why people have paper wallets, and hardware wallets.  there is a finite amount of 21mil, and around 3mil are lost forever (from wiped hds, crashes, forgetting logins, etc).  those ~18mil are not just going to be worthless, thatd be silly.  thatd be like saying once all the gold in the world is mined, it will be worthless.  think of btc like fallout caps, theyre only as valuable as the value placed on them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:04
screenshot'd for when its at +32k next year.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:59
so does gdax have no fees...?  if they do, are they significantly lower than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:52:16
it worked.  youre wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:38:48
coinbase is an exchange.  its where you can buy and sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:37:15
if you have the means to do so, and have over half left over, why not?  as long as you can live with knowing you couldve had more, once this shit skyrockets again in the coming years.  i say go for it.  paying off that debt will make you feel like a brand new human.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:41:10
so get in now, so youre not saying "i thought of buying at $16k *cries*" when it hits 200k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:22:11
except money can be printed infinitely, while btc has a finite amount.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:07:11
it appears in your transactions immediately as "pending".
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:26
and then make a ton of money in a few months.
...or in a few minutes/hours/days at this rate.
this panic is incredibly entertaining to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:08
and look where we are now!  way to not be the skeleton meme!
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:38:10
sell so you dont create this thread again next week.  like a few have already said, no one fucking cares dude.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:00:50
if one invests an amount of money they dont mind losing, its all gain.  if they lose the investment?  oh well.  if they profit heavily off an investment that meant nothing? ...OH, WELL!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:15:38
*"informations"*?  *"if you not confirm"*?  if anyone falls for that shit, then they deserve to be stripped of their btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:00
100% agree.  or people waiting when it was at 9k to dip to 5k to buy, only to see it continuing to go up.  yes, dips are inevitable, but waiting leads to the regretful comments these threads are littered with.  no thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:29:55
blockchain is a wallet, not an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:51:47
lol, it wasnt meant to be a convincing argument.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:02:27
oh im 100% serious.  look it up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:54
yeah, and alcoholics and drug addicts do the same thing.  if someone has a problem, its up to them to seek help and accountability.  its no ones fault but their own when it comes to the decisions they choose to make.  signed, a recovering alcoholic/addict.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:49:36
and at 32k, youll be doing the same thing, until you pull the trigger.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:09:25
copy your wallet id, send your btc to the copied wallet id.  did it last evening, took aprx ~12hrs for the transaction to complete.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:44:02
apparently.  jesus.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:43:55
the lambo dealership in newport beach CA takes btc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:20:08
put in an amount of money you wouldnt mind parting with, but at the same time an amount that could turn into a solid profit.  dont be another "i waited for the dip at 5k, never bought, and here we are at 15k".  those people are in every single btc thread.  learn from their mistakes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:30:24
and thats their fault for being foolish enough to put in their life savings, and not an amount theyre ok parting with.  why is this so difficult to understand?  if this was a sure thing, everyone would be dumping in their entire worth.  but it isnt, and those people that are, are extremely unintelligent.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:22
so much this.  the unintelligence is astounding.  SELL SELL SELL!  GET OUT!  lol, get fucking real.  im hodling, cunt.  im sitting well.  if it dips, ill just buy more.  if it keeps climbing, ill still buy more, and still be content with where im at regardless.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:47:32
bringing us back to btc only having 21mil period.  you cant print or mine more btc past that number.  just go with it man.  what has more value- an item that is constantly in production, and can always be made...or a limited edition item where only a select amount were made?  i think of it as a limited edition currency.  im willing to bet my life that once theyre all mined, the elite of the world are going to attempt to acquire as much as they possibly can.  then again, what do i know?  :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:44
the people spending their entire income/life savings on btc, deserve what they get.  i didnt know people could be so foolish.  im loving this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:46
seriously.  ive read countless "i bought at ____ and sold at ____, and im now wanting to kill myself." posts, its absurd.  this isnt an overnight thing, i dont know what people arent grasping here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:26:31
you really think any of those types are even capable of doing that?  remember what happened when the church of scientology went up against 'a bunch of internet nerds'?  yeah, that turned out great for them.
