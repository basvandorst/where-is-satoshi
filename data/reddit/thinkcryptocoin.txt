You can submit news however it has to be peer reviewed by trusted members before it can be posted to the public. This allows us to source every user for news but filter them by having trusted members/staff approve news. The reason Ive set it up this way is because I want to allow news to push out quickly. This is my current solution. We cant be everywhere at all times even with an rss feed, but all of us together can be.

Youre cool
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:51:36
Agreed since they dont have to pay taxes on every transaction.
So would you suggest us day traders calculate in 41% loss for every trade made? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:37
For example, I day trade. So i normally shoot for 1% gain a day outside if transaction fees. I should assume im paying 41% tax on that 1% gain correct?
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:11:58
Yeah its becoming a huge pain. Coinbase not only has to deal with the network congestion but they themselves are having load issues and wont even broadcast the transaction on time. Best way to know when a coin will take a long time is to visit status.gdax.com and see which are having issues

Its a commodity not a stock. You do not have to declare each exchange on commodities. Just capital gains at the end of the year. Profit loss.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:45:27
Lmao. You guys are sad. Its arbitrage but with a bit of a twist. Those who know really high techniques of arbitrage probably know what im doing but the fees normally make it impossible. Im not doing some magic and its not a scam.. i understand a lot of you dont even understand how to day trade so i understand your fear. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:51:52
Day trading is very possible. I do it and its changed my life. Im also a programmer who has ease with numbers and pattern recognition though so maybe thats why it came easier to me? My biggest lesson to you is if you want to day trade, make 1% a day and get out. Do not attempt more. Use a stoploss. Do not get greedy. 
Day trading is much more profitable than holding. However from the research ive done, only 1 out of 10 people who attempt to day trade are profitable. 
Dont knock it though. Its literally changed my life.

@_date: 2017-11-25 10:01:30
I think you're missing the fact that they are buying into real bitcoin in order to manipulate it to reward their large positions on the centralized CME like exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:46:47
Yeah thats what you get when you use  decentralized coin at an online babk pretty much. Its what bitcoin was meant to avoid. My suggestion is toss it to another exchange before going to or from coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:00:23
I believe they have a live support phone number, id call that number since I also hear that their email support line is not very responsive.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:07:36
Thats how scalping works ... you risk a lot to make small quick moves getting in and out. But good job knowing math and you'd also not make a market sell so it would be only a one time fee of .25%.

Did they ask you to confirm your ID?
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:46:58
Im not sure what you dont like about coinbase, maybe you're confused on how to use their service? Coinbase is connected with the trading platform gdax.com, I highly suggest you join gdax with your coinbase information. This will allow you to transfer funds via wiretransfer which clears within 24 hours. You'll also be able to purchase btc/eth/ltc without any fees. 0 fees is an awesome feature of gdax. Through the trading exchange at any time you can place a limit sell or limit buy on the exchange to purchase or sell bitcoin/eth/ltc and immediately be credited to your wallet thats on the exchange. If theres something Im missing please let me know and Ill try to help you out.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:42:59
Every exhange has different fees. Normally around .15 to .25% per buy or sale. However some do not have maker fees such as gdax.com, if you dont do a market buy there isnt a fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:46:27


it's gone? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:27:37
this should cause a hell of a pump if we see tens of millions come jamming into exchanges from different investment groups

Ive never read the post, I would like to. But wouldnt the solution be something like the key a hell of a lot longer? 
Itll be interesting times but the banks will also have to solve this issue, our encryption methods would all need to evolve.. itll be fun times :P
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:13:46
They are just showing you when you clicked buy, what price it locked in at thats the match and then what your fee was for the purchase. 
edit: this may help you in the future with gdax/coinbase trading 
Also  learn about other coins too, itll help you diversify and earn a lot more, plus IM GIVING AWAY BTC IN THAT vid
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:55:58

If you buy even 100 million of tthe real thing and short with 1 billion.. how would they get destroyed by dumping their 100 million to cause panic? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:44:50
Thats about the all time high currently
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:23:22
Edited: Ive earned somewhere around 10x return in the last 3 months. The way I got to this amount was day trading mostly BTC during the strong bull runs for a daily earning goal of 1% of my bankroll. At first it doesnt seem like a lot but as compounding interest adds up, you eventually are making a good amount. Just recently Ive had big up and down daily swings because Ive been trying to ride large break outs.
Im starting to make youtube videos to help people learn tricks of trading crypto. Hopefully people will follow and learn.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:35:46
Close it and when they ask why, make it very clear why. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:50:21
Ill say it again, gdax has no deposit or withdraw fees. What I suggest though is to keep your funds on gdax if you're going to consistently try to re-position in the currency. Gdax has no fees for buying and selling bitcoin/eth/litecoin as long as its done at a market make aka limit order. IF you do a market buy/sell that has a fee.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:41:13
That would probably help. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:34:17
its just having traffic issues, same with gemini

Yeah i try to stay away from btc unless im just trying to load more btc because i think its about to break upward
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:33:08
You're right, I edited my post. You have a very valid point and I agree that in the long run your graph really shows what holding out support can do.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:26:08
Yes the 1% is my daily goal. Sometimes I get info ( look at my most recent post ) that tells me the price is about to moon in a certain coin so Ill hold like I did with bitcoin today but I wont go to sleep or leave the computer in a position. My goal is 1% a day, that is a very hard goal believe it or not but bull markets like this make it much easier. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:29:02
Your transactions are public. It is a thing, they will ban you for using the bitcoin for nefarious things.
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:27:33
That amount will be killed by fees however coinbase is very safe and highly suggested/used by americans. You can also setup auto buys on coinbase I believe for incremental investing. You do not need a hard wallet for your btc, you can use digital ones or even leave it at the exchange in coinbases cold storage.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:55:58
I do it by hand because I do not trust a bot to handle the amount of funds I work with. You have to look for the best opps possible and make smart moves. I dont want to give away everything but keep this in mind.. theres a way to eliminate at least half the fees :P 
My fees in the end normally come out to no more than .25 to .50 MAX

Normally exchanges that are harder to liquidate or less trust worthy have lower btc value. GDAX is normally one of the highest because of how easy it is to liquidate to USD.

No, it allows for many more alerts, many more signals and indicators. Its a very nice package for day trading. What I do is use a program on my phone that when I get a certain message in a text, it turns my volume on and plays an MP3 music file to wake me up. The life of a crypto trader eh? :P 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:25:57
They have a phone line. Id call them. They arent the fastest with email support but they normally reply eventually for me.

No its not. Lmao moron. I dont sell anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:12:44
I digress from my previous statements. You have a solid point, I apologize. I just think of yahoo and ebay and remember the fall from what was their highs like 400+ with swings of 10+% daily and then being brought down to a stock that was valued at nearly nothing. Those are the things that come to mind first. But you have a valid point.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:36:21
Youre cool
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:49
check the first video link for the giveth awayeth
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:00:39
Well if your entire balance is 500 its much easier. Go to limit buy, put the price of 7000 in and then double click your balance. Itll calculate and enter how much you can afford to buy. Or just do the math of how much 500 dollars would buy at 7000, that is the correct concept. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:36:39
You are correct op that if you do a limit sell at 8000 and rebuy at 7950 you would have more btc. Day trading is very profitable but Ive read that only 10% of people who day trade can even make a consistent profit at it. 
Here are a couple videos that might help you with your question, that I made. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:10:28
You obviously dont either.

@_date: 2017-11-21 08:51:04
I suggest you do not ever again send directly from your coinbase to a casino ever again, thats the best you can do from now on.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:44:08
The biggest thing is for example if you do rebuy at a lower price and it drops beyond that, do not panic. Or buy in in incremental positions, so that if it does continue to drop from where you rebuy, you do not panic and just buy lower. Always keep in mind that as long as you're buying in lower than where you sold, you are making a smart move, in the end those smart moves will add up. Panic is what costs you in the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:44:53
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:17:09
lol the replies here are hilarious. What youll notice is that most of the coins almost perfectly follow the price of bitcoin almost all the time except when big news comes out about a specific coin that causes a big run. Otherwise if btc crashes, youll see most coins will also crash. However when BTC goes up, alts dont always go up with it lol.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:52:39

Go to the limit buy option and then double click the buy price on order list that you want to buy at, itll fill it in. You can even select a price by clicking on the chart, just make sure youre at  limit buy or sell menu. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:05:33
Sounds like a mistake was made some how. If you can prove that the order on the books was a stop sell at the price you posted then maybe they would help you. Although I highly doubt it. I would assume that some how you may have accidentally submitted a market sell or limit sell. I know you're probably thinking um Im not that stupid, but that is the only thing that would explain an immediate liquidation at that price :/
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:06:36
My understanding from your question is where does bitcoin get its value? Well youll often hear people say that its valued at whatever the public thinks it is worth. Sort of? That basically means demand decides the value which is true because there is a limited supply of bitcoin that will actually shrink in new release until it stops completely. This causes the currency to gain value as less is available for the increasing demand. 
What really sky rockets the value is the adoption of mainstream uses. This gets larger money into the game and causes that billion dollar market cap number to go up quickly, increasing the coind value quickly. So do we need mainstream market growth to increase value? Not NEED but if we want HUGE growth to continue as it has then yes we do need it. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:44:11
Yeah the dollar is used for illegal activity and buying drugs way more than bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:45:54
In the past exchanges have been hacked and peoples funds stolen. Its up to you however coinbase I believe is insured for all their funds and has a cold storage option. But you can transfer to an APP wallet like I believe one is called mycelium.

Aw damn I really want a crypto ticker in my house. Especially one that can show my specific coins im watching and maybe even alert of certain prices.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:22:38
The best way to help you find a top is for example how we saw the volume fall and the price hang out around 8250s before this quick fall. If the volume starts to really fall this is a big sign that things may be about to go the opposite way, it could also just be consolidation. Here is a video I made to help you protect your investment in scenarios like this. Hope it helps you.

Why are you talking? Learn what compounding interest is before you try to sound smart. Compounding interest of 1% a day. Come back when youve figures that out. Man they shouldnt allow dumb people here :( sorry op ignore the guy who thinks day trading is magic. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:14:15
Gdax and coinbase have frozen transfers right now due to issues on the system with all this volatility and traffic. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:55:47
Its actually rare that you can find a bot strat that trades and makes a profit in the long run. I personally go for 1% profit a day, with most break outs or buying over and over on the bottom of wedges and selling the top I can make my 1% in less than an hour. Lets say im trading 100,000 thats 1k profit at 1%. While you can say youre risking 100k to make 1k, wouldnt I be risking 100k if i just bought btc and hodled? What do you expect my returns would be in a year? Maybe 2x my investment? 10x? Think btc will be 80k by the end of next year? Did you know that if you make 1% a day, youll end up with over 35x your total investment in a year? Top that. :) Just trying to educate people. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:41:55

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:57:48
For one... its very difficult for the irc to prove anything you tell them as wrong. You say hey i traded on this exchange called mt gox.. its gonr now. I lost 50k while doing that. My total profit is this. Blah blah I also donated btc here and I invested in this ico here that failed. So many things. Just give them some money so they dont audit you lol
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:26:08
When did they ask that info
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:25:31
Yes, its always like that. First time I saw it I also was like wtf? lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:42:49
You cant delete it, its already been sent. Coinbase has frozen deposit and withdraws, just give it a bit .. itll show up bro.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:02:06
I dont know about that 28k thing but normally when you do an exchange with someone there is a very large premium. Im talking 5-20% over the current price is asked if you're buying and 5-15% under the current price if you're selling depending on the currency you're going into. Its a harsh world out there lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:51:23

limit orders will have 0 fee. Also transfers of USD to gdax have no fees. You can load up thousands and buy thousands without ever paying a single cent in fees. Its pretty great. You also do not have to trade coin to coin to avoid the fee, I strictly only trade usd to coin and I do not pay fees.

Theres a delay right now on gdax/coinbase's end.  will tell you when things may go slower than usual.

Dont feel bad op, this is actually for some reason a very hard concept for people to understand. 
Maybe this video I made can help you understsnd better. 
Let me know if that clears things up. If you sell high and buy back in anywhere lower than where you sold, you made a good move.. because you would be buying more coin since the price is cheaper. If i buy at 1,000 and I have one coin. The price goes up to 10,000 and I sell. My 1k turned to 10k. Now if the price falls to 5k and I use that 10k to buy again even though the position is not as good as my original 1k position, I now have 2 bitcoin and when price returns to 10k a coin , I can cash out for 20k! 
For some reason this confuses a lot of people. I hope that info helped. Good luck bud.

Because you'll have larger percentage swings now than you would at a higher price, its much easier to manipulate at a lower market cap.

Wow that is some creative weird logic you have. If you think that having news as soon as it breaks about a coin is going to cause all youve just came up with, i cant help you. Its not worth my time replying.

What I would suggest is having the funds pass through other exchanges before going into coinbase in order for them not to be able to follow it back to a gambling wallet.

I suggest using bittrex or poloniex as they are american companies and as such are a bit more reliable.

"has just been" "yesterday" lol Well it didnt have any affect on the price obviously.

As you stated in a reply, I believe its due to the lack of news with btc and high volatility of the alts. People in certain alts killed it while btc flutters up and down maybe 4-5% a day. Imo unless more good news breaks, we will see a dump soon. The market is fueled by new money coming in to increase the assets value, if nothing fuels that money coming in, its harder to get these huge runs. 
Time will tell. As always its very unpredictable. Day trade to win.

You think you need a crystal ball to day trade? Yeah you probably shouldnt day trade then. Just hodl.
