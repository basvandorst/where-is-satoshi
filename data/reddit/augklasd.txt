This is actually really nice man. I've been racing around between the exchanges to check the prices. This is like perfect!

So each exchange has a different price? If this is the case why would anyone use an exchange that has a higher price? I was thinking of it like exchanges where like different brokerages, all of them would offer the stock at the same price. Why would I not buy BTC from one exchange and sell it at another?

Clearly they are two different exchanges, why would the price vary from exchange to exchange, and why would anyone buy a currency at an exchange that's almost 1k above another one?

Is there any limit to This? Can you just generate as many addresses you want? Like Is there a cap on the amount that can be generated? And how do you prevent duplicate addresses being generated from different companies?

Where would one find such a thing? I mean not that I would ever use it, especially if its illegal. I mean is it illegal? Not that I'm worried, because I wont use it, even if I knew how to find it, which I don't. But where would one find such a thing? A friend of mine is curious. K thxs!

1. I'm not a kid. 2. I have plenty of extra cash, I've been investing and day trading for years. 3. I never said anything about me afraid of losing money. 4. I'm just simply trying to understand what was happening. 
Thanks for the helpless, off topic, pointless comment..kid

This is where I was confused. I couldn't figure out what exactly bitcoin classic was. For example I have BTC which I thought was bitcoin, is that bitcoin classic?
