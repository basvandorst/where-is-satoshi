Hmm.. thanks for the suggestion.  Looks like Kraken is it.  Stable, and they communicate directly with the bank.  I thought I was going to have to get a bank transfer client as well.  Thanks!

Whew, thank you.

You know, it never occurred to me to look on freaking Amazon.  Thanks!

Sorry I'm a bit slow on this.  Can you tell me what I did incorrectly in these calculations?  
Using the mining calculator I came up with this:  
  
So, if I'm using this:  
  
What info did I input incorrectly?  I'm not doubting you, just trying to see where I messed up.

My wife and daughter have copies of the backup file and the passphrase.  I also keep a copy of it in an entirely unrelated place where people will find it in the event of the simultaneous demise of all three of us.

Were you being serious, or sarcastic?  I'm not sure.  I'm so rarely correct I doubt myself.  :)

But at least you get some percentage and there are economies of scale to be considered.  A billion dollars in computers is much harder to setup and maintain than simply purchasing. Billion dollars of crypto and buying whole blocks outright.

Thank you!

Been through two of those already.  Keeps things interesting, yeah?

Actually, I made a couple of BTC today.  :-)  I'd have rather it stayed stable, but all in all, I can't complain.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:22:45
would 4 years be considered long term?

That's a very good point.  Almost a DUH moment for me.  :)  So, I'm a bit of an idiot.  Thanks!

Sure, but the point is I can't send people to Wikipedia and say 'Here, spend the next week reading these articles'.  People are interested, but to keep that interest, we have to be able to address simple questions with simple answers.

Yeah, right?  What I find amusing is after some conversations with buddies who work in the Philadelphia SE, $1M buys are not particularly noticeable for big markets.  For us though, 'voyeuristic entertainment' is a perfect description.
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:28:38
It was sold, for $26.00.  Just a reminder.. There's a sucker born every minute and two to take him.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:27:45
And, yes, many thanks man. I'm trying to get people into BTC, but the hoops are too big for a non-technical person, so this'll help there also.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:35:48
Well, if two or three individuals own a total of the market for doing essentially nothing, that's inherently out of the balance of power.  There's nothing preventing anyone from doing the same thing, utilizing the protocol and algorithms and creating a competitor, perhaps a very well funded competitor, say a government or organized crime/multinational conglomerate or a Warren Buffet.  With their fiscal capacity they could influence retailers to support their 'CorpCoin' and wango, we have a bitcoin that is not truly independent and exists to serve one master, but is foisted down the throats of an unknowing populace.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:17:24
Wow, I don't know why everyone's whining about the price of WF stuff.  My family did a purchase comparison of WF and Acme.  WF is about 12% more expensive, AND you're getting top quality organic food.  
Sure, If you're looking to spend money, there is ridiculously expensive stuff, but if you're just purchasing food and normal items, the difference is not that significant, particularly in light of quality, carbon footprint and chemicals. &lt;shrug&gt;  
On the flip side, when I can spend BTC at WF directly, then we're talking.

Sorry, I didn't mean to cast aspersions at Satoshi.  
That's a really good point about the BTC clones.  Thanks!

I think it's a matter of being verified at this point.  :-/  It never dawned on me that they might not update their site for over a year, or at least update their announcement with a year addendum.  Thanks for responding though.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:10:47
I'd really like to see a complete listing of purchases and sells for a week or two.  It'd be nice to see if there was a pattern.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:51:32
Ahah!  That's probably it then.  Makes much more sense.. Someone purchasing 10K BTC would force a huge bump in the market, methinks.  Thanks for pointing that out.

Actually, yes.  Their stuff is relatively expensive, but the guarantee is outstanding, the corporate structure is pretty damned good (e.g. fair to all employees), and their commitment to the environment is also pretty good.  
No, I don't work for REI.  :-)
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:12:18
Bummer.. why would someone downvote a perfectly straightforward question?
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:00:07
Exactly.  My wife just deposited 2500 into Dwolla.  Apparently my excitement was for naught, cause I don't see the market droppign off much more.  I was hoping for a 20-25% selloff so I could cop up a bunch.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:41:05
That's averaged for items as nearly identical as possible.  Head of Romaine in the local Acme was 1.70/head, and organic at WF was 1.99/head.  Now if you're purchasing the best vs the worst, e.g. bulk 80/20 burger from Acme is .. damn, I can't remember, about $2.50/lb vs nearly $3.50/lb in WF, but if you got step 4 or higher, you're paying $7.00/lb in WF.  If you're purchasing produce, WF is occasionally less expensive than Acme for conventional items.  The same goes for the local ShopRite and Genuardis.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:11:41
Yeah, but most people don't accept BTC as downpayments on cars.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 14:30:42
Well Done!  Kudos, gentle!  :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:40:05
 Wish I could change the title.  I think the question is still valid, even of the examples were incorrect.
@_date: 2013-09-13 13:18:52
Ok, so I'm going to be making a few purchases.  I have to ask, where are you sourcing the product?  It looks like you're a VAR to Amazon.  I mean to cast no aspersions, if you worked a deal with someone to get your products at a %, good on you.  I'm just really curious about how you're adding this stuff so rapidly.

LOL.. sorry, I mistook your comment as an answer to another question I'd posted.  :)  The reason is still valid, but for a completely different... reason.  :-/
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:37:31
My problem is, I cannot yet purchase regular items in the US w/ BTC.  I would love to purchase toilet paper or glue or motor oil with BTC, but I can't.  Are there any providers that provide purchase of daily goods with BTC?

are you being serious or facetious?  The buy was for 9999.99 BTC, or roughly 1M USD.

OOOHHH.. so the BTC are not 'removed' from the blockchain, the address and associated BTC are simply not stored on any centrally hosted server, but only as an address on the blockchain proper.  I think I just had one of those Eureka! moments.  I've cognitively understood how the blockchain works, but your illustration of paper wallets sort of brought it all together on a fundamental level, I kind of 'get' it.

Steady increase with just a little variation from day to day.  The upswings are pretty reliable over time as well.. evenings (EST) they go up and spike in the early AM hours then level over the day when most Americans are trading.  It just seems too... pat...
