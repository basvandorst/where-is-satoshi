BCH has fewer problems with scaling and also can boast of low transaction commissions. 
Therefore it’s a better currency than btc, but a worse investment

If traders believe that a piece of shit is worth millions, then everyone would invest in sewage plants

Anyone wanna talk about Coinbase card?
@_date: 2019-07-12 13:14:49
I just ordered mine and am a bit curious if you can really just go into the next supermarket and buy something as you would normally with your "normal card"

These statements are objectively true in regards to on-chain comparison. You also have to remember that the L2 LN is crippling down BTC on-chain.
I wasn’t making a comparison between the technical evolution of BCH and BTC atm in regards to using it in the "real world" to buy something. But also regarding this BCH is superior as a currency. 
First who would buy BTC in 2019 to buy something in the real world? Only idiots who don’t care about loosing a lot of profit. 
Moreover BCH can do mostly everything BTC needed two layers for. It already has little fees and fast transaction time because of bigger blocks whereas BTC made the mistake to implement SegWit instead of increasing block size. Therefore it’s in a far better spot as currency currently.
Finally there’s still the option to also implement a L2 for BCH which will do better than BTC because it’s probably going to be a HF, so you get a clean start. Not a hacked backwards way that BTC is doing.

In a conversation:
Person 1; So what do you think about btc jumping up to 13k
Person 2(5 sec later): You mean the fall to 9.5k?
Person 1(1 sec later): Nah, I’m talking about btc going up to 11k
Person 3 (5 min later): Guys, are you talking about the tremendous crash of btc back to 3k?
@_date: 2019-07-16 13:22:51
Is there a extra fee when I use it to buy something?
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:42:27
Why should BCH be a scam? Objectively seen it’s protocol has more advantages than BTC

But let’s also not forget about Ethereum. With both of these replacing the real world, we would be one step closer to a fully digitalized and most importantly anonymous world where you can literally buy a house in one second and make a fully functioning lease in another one.

Why should it use another cryptocurrency except it’s own? Also you should remember that Ethereum does NOT try to be a currency. It’s know for handling contracts between different parties , so something like btc doesn’t fit into this concept.

From my understanding it’s not even a coin. It’s a 2. layer protocol just like LN(but only for Ethereum?) that prioritizes privacy and anonymity and would therefore also be a big step for crypto’s in this regard

The smart contract is as broken as the person who wrote it. If you know the language and the syntax, there’s no problem in making f.e. a successful escrow with this. Moreover it’s not something you invest in like bitcoin. It’s not made to make daily payments with it or use even use it to gain money, so anyone who thinks to make profit out of it is just delusional
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:36:17
Yeah, that’s right. That’s why I’m pretty excited when Enigma will be finally implemented as a protocol in smart contracts
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:05:39
Ethereum is less centralized than whole bitcoin. Who do you think has more than half of the hash power? Of course not only individuals. Also it’s whole concept of proof of work makes it more competitive why it’s also perfect as a currency, but just smashing layer after layer on btc to make it the ultimate crypto is just a delusional dream that is neither technically possible nor pretty clever.
 It’s true that btc also has the ability to make smart contracts, but only primitives and not with all the functions Ethereum can since it’s literally a programmable cryptocurrency that can and also already does literally anything you can imagine.
I also tried to make smart contracts for escrow and I can tell you this is pretty cool and practical not having the need to have someone like paypal or any other person that functions as middleman here, and all of this completely anonymous (well, actually not yet, but soon).

Ok, if your point was to rather get knowledge by yourself than get a immense loan for higher education that you will likely have paid in 20+ years, I can agree with you.
But since I’m don’t have to study in such a shit country where good education is only for the rich, studying is a must do to have a successful future.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:53:23
Offtopic, but can anyone explain me what Enigma  is?
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:09:06
Ah thanks dude, exactly what I was looking for :)
@_date: 2019-06-18 22:25:46
*Me seeing my friend buying $500 of btc on an obvious scam site*
I just gonna pretend I didn’t see that
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:01:23
More like, let’s hope. Then I can finally stock up my wallet again
@_date: 2019-08-09 10:53:01
That’s pretty naive though
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:30
And I ended up buying at freaking 11 cause of this lol
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:25:39
I mean if my bank would offer interests of 5-10% for every day, I would rather starve now and be rich one day than spend any of it now.
