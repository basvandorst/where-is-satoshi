I'm fucking kicking myself I was watching the gains on the markets 24 hours ago thinking this can't be real, woke up to the day of blood and I didn't act on my gut and put the gains in tether fml

People don't seem to care about fundentals yet but as the market gets more educated maybe they will.. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:17:11
Show me on the Dolly where bitcoin touched you. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:25
That's fucking awesome.. I mean not really I hope all those people are OK but fuck me it's just perfect.

The property market crashed and didn't dissappear, the Blockchain is going nowhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:56:52
Blockchain, read about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:31:54
Why doge? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:09:59
It's not a currency, there's other coins for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:28:56
If people are over leveraged in anything then that's on them.. Stocks, Real Estate, Crypto or anything else. The thing about crypto is that it is as legitimate as any of the others. The Blockchain is now a proven store of value as well as being a trust less ledger that has applications in everything from shipping to accounting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:59
It absolutely is a store of value, not a stable one but it has proven the Blockchain can store money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:52
Look its not a currency its not gold its not like anything finance has seen before.. Besides all of that the Blockchain over the last 9 years it has shown it can hold monetary value as a base property. The Blockchain is capable of much more than that as you can see with Ethereum and other gen 2 iterations. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:59:06
Yeah it's more a game than having my lifesavings in it but sheesh just another learning opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:53:17
The best thing about btc is that it introduces people to crypto tech but if you treat it like a get rich scheme you will get burnt, on that I agree.

That's gonna put a dent in btc trading
@_date: 2014-05-15 07:55:30
Well if you only hold and see value in btc that's cool. Each to their own.
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:15:48
Or regurgitation by an illiterate cult member amirite
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:09:14
Didn't the CEO of Bitcoin commit suicide?
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:35:48
Or just make a whinge thread about it like op
@_date: 2014-03-22 06:59:02

That's the reason the action was launched from what I read.
@_date: 2014-04-06 05:54:17
Active Devs so see what happens also scaling up to handle millions of transactions a minute needs to be solved for mass adoption
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:40:23
Shouting will definitely help \o/
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:20:16
Cause their goxxing er'body out there
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:30:23
Bitcoin is good at being gold bad at being currency. Btc holders want other people to spend so they can hold and benefit that's why business adoption is outpacing consumer adoption. We'll see if dogecoin can push crypto based consumers as it's better suited as a currency with so many coins coming online so fast that should keep the price accessible and bring new people to cryptos
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:09:24
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:28:12
Wow thankyou. That's very generous.
@_date: 2014-03-20 08:16:59
its 4 months old and yes it will be the dollar bills of digital currency SRS 
edit for correctness
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:38:34
This is actually good news
@_date: 2014-05-16 10:54:46
I'll downvote my post then :)
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:22:03
It's a hardware wallet
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:19:39
Yep. Dogecoin will bring more people into cryptos which helps everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:56:33

Lol the meme was like the placenta. discarded after birth.
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:43:35
Dogecoin will break crypto to the masses. Bitcoin will only profit from this.
+20 doge 
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:46:19
Litecoin is getting less and less relevant :x
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:33:52
So let me clear this up. Your predicting the total coin death of Doge in 3 months.. 1 month? People have been writing off Doge since the start where are they now?
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:06:19
That's pretty fucking good news freals
@_date: 2014-05-15 06:45:22


People like to diversify for security. Diversification is a pretty solid investment strategy.
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:36:04
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:14:01
you clearly care enough to post hmm
@_date: 2014-03-26 10:54:26
 *sneeze* damn it that dogecoin is infectious
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:10:51
Hell go crazy, unite the cryptos and sponsor the whole derby one car each coin
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:23:27
You should see now THAT is a fad currency
@_date: 2014-05-13 10:38:50
Who said you can't teach an old Doge new tricks. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:58:04
This is Actually Good News!
@_date: 2014-05-15 01:49:47
Dogecoin is fast becoming the most attractive alt and it's only 5 months old. It's unique appeal is hard to define and even harder to deny. It has influenced the culture of btc here with increased tipping decreased hostility to new comers and increase in sponsorship opportunities. Doge is good for btc as it brings in new people to crypto and those people end up holding btc once they work out how well developed it is in the crypto space.
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:10:12
What is this chicanery ? Thought this was a alt currency thread. Props to you btc dude
@_date: 2014-05-10 07:29:00

+10 doge
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:29:35
What's your source for that statement ?
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:16:17
Following the paper trail is often the most successful way to I.d individuals. and the only weapons they want to regulate are N.B.C and man portable surface to air systems. Everything else is for sale to anyone.
@_date: 2014-05-11 09:06:30
That certainly is good news
@_date: 2014-03-20 12:26:50
no worries +100 doge

See if you can find a android that lets you use apps and wifi without a sim
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:38:18
Thanks for your reply you have an awesome day as well. I personally judge a digital currency on how much it's used, merchant adoption and payment supports. And yeah it did sound a bit like an ad.. :s
@_date: 2014-05-15 05:07:29
I think ltc creator Lee describes it more as a hedge against the unlikely event that the btc blockchain was compromised.
@_date: 2014-03-21 06:26:20
 Certainly indicates this
@_date: 2014-03-26 10:01:59
i thought you had commited suicide?
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:50:57
Awesome tyvm 
@_date: 2014-05-08 09:45:12
I too thought it was fairly balanced except they have no idea how a trustless ledger works. Other than that...
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:15:54
@_date: 2014-05-16 09:44:38
Lol clutching at straws or trying to be funny not sure which

It's stabilising at around 50 Gh. It's clearer if you look at the 3 month view
@_date: 2014-05-10 09:45:50
They are both rocking the Patrick Bateman look.
@_date: 2014-05-15 03:31:46
Your assuming a lot of ignorance of how cryptos work on my behalf. Therefore lauding your own undeniable grasp of the subject. On what basis do u assume the complete destruction of the Doge hashrate. Can u see the future. ?
@_date: 2014-05-11 10:50:03
Yes I know it's v popular in too
