Im a college student and any time I have extra money I throw it into btc. This actually stops me from stupid spending.

ah thanks, are people really speculating that in the long run theirs a chance they could reach 10k per? Would this be caused by less coins being mined and bitcoins becoming more mainstream and more people using them / places accepting them?

Curious also, even at 440 is it time to fire away at more btc? 
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:38:13
Haha same

I'm not defending whether i "panic bought". Im here for the long run so panic buying is irrelevant. Im a strong believer its going to surpass and break the 5 barrier again. Ill buy more at whatever price it keeps rising to when i have extra money around.

How long did it take for the mini deposits ?
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:25:12

Same averaging like 395, just wondering how many people are buying at the current price
