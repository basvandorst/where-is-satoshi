You glazed over the fact that OP hideously misspells "cartals".

I'm a merchant that prices my products in Bitcoin. That guy is full of shit.

Sorry, got to the blog and saw anarchism in the subtitle. Not interested in building an economy on those foundations; I think we'll have to agree to disagree on this since I've never been able to get around an anarchist's reasoning.

I call it deflationary and I never mean monetary deflation. I think people that use the term as part of reasoned arguments generally know what they mean.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:51:35
Yeah, government restriction is even more unlikely since it would be so difficult to enforce.
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:00:31
You continue to use hyperbole without providing supporting logic. You're also ignoring the fact that the purpose is not to hold and trade these notes but to invest bitcoins in a lending institution.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:46:35
Well, by stable I don't mean stagnant. We can have measured growth in price that is still stable, but this level of volatility makes it difficult on businesses.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:06:06
I see your point (even through the hyperbole). I know that some people don't like banks, but why would allowing other willing and eager customers have access to the services they want hurt you? It's not like it would stop you from using bitcoin as you currently are.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:42:12
Because they can receive interest on their promissory note that they would not otherwise receive from their wallet.

It was just an antiquated law aimed at security. People got used to it and even when legislature finally did away with it nobody cared to rock the boat.

Nah, I totally appreciate the feedback. I never use FF so someone needed to tell me eventually!
Hopefully you keep checking in from time to time :)

Did you read it? 
Alternative as an adjective means mutually exclusive. 
Sub means secondary or subordinate.
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:17:02
Yeah, that's kind of the point. If anybody could accurately predict these things, they would be doing so from their yacht.

Generally, my products are not high-dollar items, so its better to err on the side of customer service. As stated earlier, other payment processing methods can take days or weeks to complete, so it doesn't have a huge negative impact.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:33:18
I don't think the bitcoin economy is by any means an enemy of the state.
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:27:33
As others have mentioned, in person I would give the product first and follow up after 24 hours if payment still didn't arrive.
Online (although we have no online interface yet) I would not send product until payment is received. Most likely, I will put a disclaimer explaining how transaction fees affect processing times.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:24:04
Please, let's stop calling them alt-coins. Alternative suggests that they could replace bitcoin, which is not the function they serve. It's time to call them what they are, SubCoins.

The link above is not a link to the official announcement. It contains novel and original analysis of the situation, possible causes, and offers advice to investors. 
It isn't a repost.
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:51:04
From an economic perspective, such a correction would only amount to the size of the fees theoretically. Probably negligible given the volatility of the currency.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:43:42
Same here. None of the organizations answered my tweets requesting info on ฿.
@_date: 2013-07-20 14:12:34
Awesome idea. I just opened my first bitcoin wallet, but am finding it impossible to get any coin in.
I'm exploring accepting coin for my business.
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:14:02
I suppose that I'm more excited by the system than the price. Obviously I benefit from rises in price, but I would prefer a stable currency in the long run.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:26:20
If someone technically-skilled enough can produce the notes, I would be proud to post them regularly on the blog.

How about speculation from Chinese investors? That was the entire basis of the argument presented here: 
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:28:30
We are making our first sales this week, so we haven't put a lot into an online presence. Sorry!

VAT is flat 10% Ex-Pats that don't fall under a tax treaty are taxed at a cap of 15% income. Korean nationals pay up to 25%
@_date: 2013-10-30 01:57:29
Hope it's all fixed now. Firefox has been about 19% of my traffic, so it's a bit embarrassing that this was a global issue with that browser.
Thanks for alerting me.

According to good reddiquette its best to just click "report" rather than gum up the comments.

The domain  is for sale if you happen to need it.
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:55:30
I think there are better talking points for merchants. Like near-zero transaction fees and no chargebacks. 
You hit the advertising/marketing point pretty well though.

Perhaps he was referring to an average. It would certainly scale by hardware. 
Maybe the answer is to put in incentives on the network for high-volume nodes via the mining fee?

I haven't used Armory yet, but the important thing to have is the private key. I recommend encrypting (heavily) an offline storage device, such as a thumbdrive, to store the private key. Otherwise, write down the seed on a piece of paper and store it somewhere safe, preferably in a safe, just as you would store a bar of gold. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 13:41:41
Yeah, banks had to use ActiveX for any transaction by law up until 2010, so IE still has 98% market share in Korea and banks still have the software that requires it.
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:27:34
I have to say that as a small business owner the volatility is a major concern since my margins are already razor thin. I offer flat prices to local customers at the start of each week, but that still puts me at risk.
I only do it because my BTC customers requested it and I want to offer good customer service.
@_date: 2013-07-30 04:20:17
Yeah, its pretty bad that he is calling this a ban, when it appears to be (at present) an advisement based on the lack of applicable regulations from the BoT.
@_date: 2013-07-23 03:51:16
I totally understand this. We made our first sales last week and are still in the process of obtaining a business license, so bear with us as our online presence is not a current priority (it certainly will be).
@_date: 2013-10-28 14:28:16
Like I said, I think it's a waste of time for either of us to try to disprove the other. Thanks for the kind words about my blog though. 
Much love.

What OS/Browser were you using. It seems to be an isolated issue.

If you support this, use the hashtag  on twitter.

I don't know how someone can understand bitcoin and make this mistake. Maybe you need to be reading better sources (I know, we have a dearth of quality writers in the space). Whenever I talk about deflation on my blog, I'm referring to the increase in real value due to expansion of demand in the face of static supply.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:04:13
Details on nomenclature included in the article. :)
(You're on the right track)
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:52:15
Did you read the article?
It's explicitly stated that they would only be able to lend to BTC operators to avoid exchange risk.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:33:00
Yep, this is exactly the problem with the Bitcoin Foundation. They are an industry group, not an actual altruistic entity. We need outside devs coming up with solutions too.
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:15:58
Yep, that was the point of all of that economic analysis.
@_date: 2013-10-29 12:41:10
Definitely not like that on mine. Is the issue limited to the italics text?
@_date: 2013-11-11 02:52:55
I don't see any reasonable outcome in which bitcoin replaces a sovereign currency. It is simply an economic instrument for commerce that is driving innovative business structures. 
Did you read the quote from congress at the end of the article?

If you know of a charity that accepts bitcoin and will be active in the Philippine disaster, please post here!
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:07:41
Can we get the link for it?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:20:58
The answer is for more developers outside of the foundation to participate, not for them to bring more in. The foundation is run by capitalists with large stakes in certain areas of bitcoins; we can't entrust anything to a few of the top bitcoiners (especially if you don't like the idea of banks having power, you should be uncomfortable with this).
@_date: 2013-07-23 03:15:52
We're in South Korea. Unfortunately we may be the only brick and mortar business in the country and we aren't certifed by the KFDA to export yet.
I wasn't intending this post as a sales pitch but a unique perspective on the pros and cons of BTC commerce.
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:53:45
They would probably package it with more critical updates to try to strong-arm nodes into including it. That's not to say some Git-hubbers couldn't piece it out for interested parties.
