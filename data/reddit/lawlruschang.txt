What a completely arbitrary standard lol
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:16:23
What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:15:19
Only if you take them to a reductionist extreme
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:16:19
You needa learn about elasticity of demand fam
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:53:31
that's why they dissolved their relationship with their auditor last week huh? the delusion is fucking real
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:33:18
ethereum currently does more transactions per day than any other blockchain and still has lower fees and faster transaction times
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:32:37
if you invest in a coin with solid long term potential like ETH/NEO/KNC, you should be ok
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:19:14
You realize you guys need 2-3 trillion dollar market cap just for 10x gains? Smh lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:42:42
Yeah amzn isn’t the way to go either
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:16:56
Older news can never refute newer news... this is basic logic
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:41
Still expecting bitcoin cap to go to 2.5 trillion just for 10x gains loooool
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:09:03
Loooool. So then ETH will continue to outperform bitcoin year after year then?
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:07:34
Actually banksters are in the business of making money and have way more capital and leverage available of them to take advantage of a crypto Moon than you or I. And no, bitcoin will never replace fiat, that’s delusional
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:22:12
It’s about ROI, friend. Learn investing 101. Total market cap does you no good expect limit upside potential
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:02:03
You have billions?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:08
You are spot on
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:55
People in here are willing to sacrifice the earth for 10-20x gains lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:10:04
How can you say this? Holy shit
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:08:47
Jesus... look at what you people have done... smh
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:10:08
Well your hypothetical is nice but it doesn’t apply to the situation bitcoin is in. And I would argue for crypto the price of an asset is even more so tied to market cap than for other assets because it is infinitesimally divisible, making a “bitcoin” an arbitrary unit as opposed to one millionth or one billionth or whatever else
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:47:59
What jump lol we are already at 300 billion market cap
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:43:10
Doubtful. That would be 3x the total value of korean won in circulation lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:15
Op presented it as an either or choice between banksters and fiat or crypto and nonbanksters
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:50
You don’t sell to Coinbase, you buy and sell from other ppl
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:17
Considering that bitcoin is a speculative asset, I think people will see that the runway is running out and the market will cool off soon
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:43:35
I haven’t sold
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:16:00
It doesn’t guarantee a return. Nothing does. ETH POS is a little closer tho
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:56:43
Generally the "trend" of being  doesn't mean much in the long run. See: AIM, blockbuster, MySpace, Netscape, Nokia, etc
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:09:07
Bitcoin isn't going to moon... its market cap is too high for that to really happen. Unless you see billions upon billions being injected on a daily basis
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:05:47
Bitcoin sucks
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:18:36
How is bitcoin Facebook when it's the first iteration of the blockchain that has gained traction? Seems more like MySpace...
Why is it unlikely that other coins will be adopted? Because the price of bitcoin went up this week? Still not sure how this could ever be used on a day to day basis as currency with the transaction costs, confirmation times, and lack of smart contract functionality
Like bitcoin literally doesn't allow us to do anything that much differently from how it's been in the past. Nobody could explain how it's anything more than digital fiat. Just sounds like a new fiat that is owned by early BTC investors as opposed to traditional financial institutions
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:08:13
future tense my friend. you have indeed reached the moon
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:22:07
But what does it actually do that is new? You can spend it send it receive it just like fiat. I don't see how that is going to revolutionize anything. The average consumer doesn't care about the first 3 things, and they are easily replicated by another platform with lower fees and transaction times.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:36:17
Other crypto can't be counterfeited either, sorry I'm hearing lots of arguments for crypto in general but none for bitcoin in particular
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:07:48
7 trillion dollar market cap for what is essentially digital fiat? I don't think so
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:06:27
Can someone explain to me what gives bitcoin intrinsic value? Or is it just digital fiat essentially. Haven't been able to get an answer anywhere so far
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:06:45
I never suggested that. That was purely your own inference. It is fact that the higher the market cap, the greater absolute amount you need to shift the price x %
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:10:02
You're insane
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:38:41
No I wouldn't. Because there are plenty of things in the world that are worth a billion. eBay, twitter, Coinbase etc.
How many things are worth 7 trillion?
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:31:49
Crypto yes BTC no
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:19:51
Then I'm definitely out
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:21:15
they're not high. 14 cent fee for eth transfer today
@_date: 2017-08-18 02:19:40
sounds like any cryptocurrency that works and has an effective cap
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:19:22
But any other coin can also be only 21 million. You could even make it less
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:05:45
that's mere percentage points during a very bullish period for btc alone
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:22:47
he also predicts 25k by 2022, about 6x, while IMO by that time eth will probably be around 5k ~17x
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:16:39
so no intrinsic value that another blockchain couldn't replicate? it's just the fact that we have up to this point agreed that bitcoin is it huh... man doesn't sound very encouraging long term as other more evolved blockchains gain traction
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:34:32
So... what any other crypto can do except faster and cheaper. Ok
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:35:46
No... it's like assigning Tesla cars value because they can turn electricity into mechanical power
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:22:31
That's not value.... those are features
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:50:13
That’s why EY, JP morgan, microsoft, amazon, ubisoft, santander, etc are all using bitcoin instead of ethereum right?? /s
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:53:59
Benefits of crypto* not bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:24:29
What a lovely, purely profit oriented community you have. You laugh at the idea of people losing tons of money. Disgusting.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:09:24
but you said money is zero sum, not trading. each time value is created, it is not destroyed elsewhere, so it's not zero sum... lel
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:25:19
So since it’s quicker, the Tesla is ETH and BTC is the lambo?
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:04:53
A solid investor doesn’t base their decisions off what others do
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:06:24
this isn't over... lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:53:13
20 billion to 200 billion is not the same as 200 billion to 2 trillion. It amazes me how many people on this sub and bitcoin supporters in general do not understand this basic economic reality and instead manage their MONEY based off a logical fallacy. Bitcoin is becoming the Tea Party of crypto
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:13:56
Good indicator of bubble - this guy literally implies that he doesn’t know what he’s doing yet is putting in HALF of his paycheck... ��
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:51:49
I’ll admit now that I’m an eth maximalist. ETH community also has a lot of negativity and greed, but I feel that because eth as a project has goals other than currency, there is a large segment that is more levelheaded. My honest take is that bitcoin’s primary focus as a currency and asset gives rise to a certain type of attitude within the community sorta like an investment bank vs a tech company.
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:38:49
The race has just begun
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:48:34
Well 1. that would mean BTC is going to zero and 2. Just untrue, ever heard of FANG?
How come blockbuster didn’t take it all? Oh bc something innovative came along and they chose not to adopt those innovations because they were the first and “best” at the time
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:58:37
I did
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:41:54
Hm, I’m actually not sure whether I fall within your interpretation of taking money seriously, but to take enjoyment in someone else’s suffering is not good for this world.
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:10:50
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:30:36
Not when you could do it for 10 cents in less than 5 minutes...
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:28:40
stop downvoting people like this who are mentioning a single iota of negativity. people need to be prepared for all scenarios
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:08:35
uh... selling bitcoin at 5500 and buying bcash at 2800 is like a 70% loss. i wouldn't call that "not making a ton of money"
if you want to follow that philosophy, fine. i follow it to an extent too. but to try to apply it to other people's woes is pure egocentrism
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:26:30
Yes I
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:39:34
“Programmable money”
Then discuss counterparty risk and they should understand why money needs to be programmable
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:27:19
What a horrible fucking comparison. Brazil and Singapore also have, you know, millions of actual people living there who are utilizing electricity
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:30:51
If they work for a billion dollar corporation
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:04:38
So you clearly don’t know what you’re doing if you waited until 6k...
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:19:09
“Do you guys think this is a good idea”
No you don’t know what you’re doing. You don’t know what gives bitcoin value, you don’t know how its value compares to other higher potential vs risk currencies like ethereum, you’re just mindlessly following what you’ve seen others do and heard them say. You have 20-40% downside risk over the next few months.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:06:53
the question is whether fake tethers have been used to pump btc's price since 4-5k
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:21:34
Races aren’t won in the first lap
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:36:51
Trading is zero sum, but investing is not. Learn bro
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:27:27
Care to explain? I’m an economics major lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:31:19
A lot of people think so
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:40:10
i was telling people to stop downvoting you
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:28:43
Yup dollar fees and 15 minute wait times are very sound
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:44:21
if this blows up we could see 5k bitcoin and 200 eth. always be aware and cautious of the downside (branson)
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:02:26
3-5x isn't enough for lambo
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:57:25
It is not a commodity or stock
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:32
those are the reasons why it is already king, not why it will be. your reasoning is way too basic
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:57:46
Hahahahahahaha somebody missed the bottom
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:42
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:01:08
We haven't shown any signs of exiting the descending channel - expect to test 3k at least once more
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:24:00
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:52:44
It's just 1 store ��
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:59:05
Why would they buy something that can't be sold in 2 months... that makes no sense
@_date: 2017-09-17 12:02:29
First off there's no way for you to know that with certainty. Second of all you clearly don't TA
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:11:30
it was fun while it lasted guys
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:12
btc remaining king... lmfaoo
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:06
it's a terrible fucking store of value because it has no intrinsic use case. lmfao
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:34:28
What if you could improve the world to a point where people didn't need to deal with the jungle.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:30:05
