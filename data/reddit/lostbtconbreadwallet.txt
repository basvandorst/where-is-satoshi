Have to admit I have been doing pretty Good But not yet a millionaire story. We Will see What the Future holds for US!

You Really think this is STILL just the beginning? Just Curious 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:42:53
Best comment I have read today lol. 
My bitcoins Didnt increase Guess theyre all male
EDIT: Got bitcoin cash From the 1 August fork, they were indeed male and female.
Mind is blown!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:15:58
When you Buy bitcoin or Any other crypto online they charge fees. So if you paid 40 dollars on Btc you Will not get 40 dollars worth of Btc. 
I personally Wouldnt keep anything on coinbase, if they mess up on anything Youre lost. Keep Your crypto in Your OWN control. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:26:51
If you want more bitcoin:
When Bitcoin reaches all time highs like today. Sell them. Wait for bitcoin to dip in price Buy it.
Example. Buy 1 bitcoin for 8k sell at 10k, Wait till it drops to 8.7k then Buy again.
Do this over and over till you made 2 bitcoin, The more bitcoin you have the more money you make.
Gotta warn you though that alot of people lose money while day trading bitcoin. The safest bet Will be holding bitcoin till it increases in price But this is also the slowest way of making money with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:22:33
Yes in reddit, But cant see the message anymore? Looks like Its deleted. And Didnt pay attention to it till another user dm'd me saying he Got a message From a person saying Its me. The user that dm'd me Got like 16k karma So Its a real account. The other phishing account was only 1 hour old.. Can I Still report if I Dont know the name of the phisher?
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:35:38
Maybe you Can study Some alt Coins that have the potential to double or tripple in value faster than bitcoin. The profits you make you Can put in bitcoin. This is a better way to increase the Amount of Btc you have. Try looking at cryptocurrency called "lisk" they have a big announcements Tomorrow that may double or tripple Its price in 1 or 2 Months.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:43:22
No Problem, you Can Pm me always If you have questions 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:23:35
I was thinking that too, But Maybe spent too much to invest anymore could be a possibility. Ah Well, not too late yet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:45:54
Worth the upgrade?

Damn. Your life is hard. Go start a gofundme page.

First you have to meditate to Satoshi Nakamoto. If you are the chosen one he will visit you in a lucid dream and take you to the magical forest. He will make you choose between a bitcoin and a Litecoin, 
You take the Litecoin, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the bitcoin, you stay in Wonderland, and Satoshi Nakamoto will show you the way to a bitcoin ATM to get bitcoins. 
Dont worry every hodler has been there. Good luck pal.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:35:36
I order food and pay with bitcoin! Minus the fees Its great

@_date: 2017-11-20 03:00:09
Invest in lisk, 21 november they have announcements.
rebranding, 
Possible partnership with harvard medical and Google. 
Sdk (software development kit) release date.
Read into it, Might tripple Your investment or even more if one of the announcements they make is in short term!
THEN Buy bitcoin with Your profits!
Good luck

I Dont think Its a bubble or a ponzi, Im a believer in crypto. Talking about people who keep dismissing it and Dont see the greatness of crypto in general
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:19:35
Thats Because people are Selling Btc now Because of the all time high couple minutes ago. It Will rise again, Im Sure. Dont look at the dollars, look at the satoshis. They Remain the same right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:48:07
Sustanon it is.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:31:37
Haha No worries, if you have more questions  I Will Love to help you and Im Sure others here too! Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:28:04
Lol this section is called "bitcoin" you Can ask 1000 questions. 
The satoshis Will remain the same. So if you had 0,000123 satoshis it Will stay that way, So it wont Increase or get lower. The dollar to Btc Will change. 
So Those 0.000123 satoshis Can be worth 1 dollar or 100 dollars in fiat currency. Hope this helps?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:10:12
Get a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger! Good luck! 
Its a Good investment if you want to Grow Your crypto portofolio.

Since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women. 
On topic: Im not a fan of B2X myself either, But Thought Might profit From this besides the oldskool hodling.

I always saw 1 Btc on my breadwallet app. Then suddenly couple of days ago it Said 0 btc. 
After syncing, rescanning and recovering the breadwallet app Still says 0 Btc!
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:01:26
They Didnt do anything for me. I have been googling everything I Can think of these couple of days. 
The recovery phrase is not wrong they Just Said that Because breadwallet support does not want to accept that their app is faulty and users can lose their Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:56:47
I know! But they Dont admit that there is a bug in their breadwallet app! 
Because I have the 1 Btc on my "old" address But 0 on the New! Rescanned the blockchain and everything.
