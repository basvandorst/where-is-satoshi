I hope in the future that my bitcoins will buy me ribbons too.

“More drugs and sex have been bought with fiat currency than bitcoin ever will”
Obviously you’ve never spent a weekend at mine.

Where can I spend my BTC? I haven’t seen one single store accepting BTC. I live in Australia.
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:21:29
I can’t wait for BTC to be a global currency. 
I just hope that the criminals start abiding by the law and stop manipulating the price.

Hodl and hope the price goes up and then the whales can dump a load.

Celebrate then manipulate.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:22:38
And wrong again.
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:25:27
I predict the price to go up, down and sideways. Mark my words.

Sent around $90 in BTC a couple hours ago. Fee was around $2 but still not even one confirmation. 
Is this the norm?
@_date: 2019-06-03 10:33:06
Still no confirmations. I sent it from my Blockchain wallet. I can wait a bit longer was hoping it’d be confirmed by now. Maybe it has something to do with the blockchain wallet as it’s a little slow logging in. Just a thought.

And the other last chance was last week and the week before that too.

Sorry I must of missed the humour.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:21:36
Thanks. 
I’ve done quite a few transactions over the past few months but this one seems to be dragging.  I used the QR code too so I guessing it’s correct.

I use Trezor. I only used Blockchain for convenience as I wasn’t home.

More head than a prostitute gives.
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:20:04
 Yeah ok, but are you buying any more BTC?
@_date: 2019-09-28 09:13:20
Probably after 19k
