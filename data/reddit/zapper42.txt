but obama had a say in said war, but has chosen to continue.
it's unlikely any physicists had any say.

?[ dell says]( their hardware may come with a 90 day, 1, 2,3,4, or 5 year warranty.
I wouldn't expect most of them to be 5 year with that range.
Looking around at some computer hardware, most part warranties aren't that long these days either.  I still remember getting lifetime warranties on video cards a few years back that transfered to new owners upon selling used.  Western digital drives are 5 years though (or at least some of them).

uhh, yeah of course.  You still may buy it prebuilt knowing someone will be able to fix the entire computer rather than just a part without an extra fee.  Hence buying the prebuilt with the warranty in mind.  But Dell offers extended warranties that cost extra $.

It is irrelevant to any current Dell, but a bit of trivia.

yeah, but you have some ugly sticker on the back -
it's just as easy not to was my point.  You could bookmark it or save it.  The information on the sticker is usually incomplete and just has a few handpicked stats anyway.

? i'm not trying to make that argument.
Some people buy prebuilts because of the warranty.

the model # is already on the back in 99% of cases, and the owners manual pdf is a google away.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:55:48
well if they're buying a prebuilt with the warranty service in mind.
Or they buy an extended warranty.
so, yeah.

How is the length of the warranty period anything to do with the cost of the warranties by the manufacturers again?
I'm totally missing the connection, sorry if it is obvious to everyone else.

The separate warranties on pc parts generally exceed a prebuilt's warranty length.
You get shittier parts usually with prebuilts in general as well. (hard drives, optical, power supplies).  Though I do not have experience with Alienwares specifically,  Dells I've worked on over the years were pretty cheaply constructed.
As long as you know you are spending money on warranties, image, and convenience - it is fine.  I'd rather have good parts personally and putting together a computer is pretty easy and fun (ymmv).

I still have no idea what you are talking about exactly.
Dell has many different warranty plans for their different products.
from 90 days up to 5 years.
Generally buying a PART you get a longer warranty than an average prebuilt computer.  Not always, of course.
I'd imagine there aren't too many parts out there that are going to be longer than a 5 year warranty, so exceptions exist of course.

i've replaced power supplies on a few dells, but I'm not in IT or anything so I don't work on computers much.
They used to use a proprietary connector and would fry your motherboard if you tried to use a non-dell PSU](  
But not anymore.  I'm sure their stuff is better now (hopefully), it's been awhile since I worked on a dell and it was ancient then.

i guess the entire product, first sentence from link:
*Dell-branded hardware products purchased in the U.S. or Canada may come with a 90-day, 1-year, 2-year, 3-year, 4-year, 5-year or other limited hardware warranty.*
