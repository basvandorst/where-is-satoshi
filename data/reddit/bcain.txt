Got a response from an admin.  From the lack of response to my follow up questions, I get the impression that I won't be able to get this undone.  I guess maybe I deserved it, but I really wasn't trying to cause trouble.
Maybe I'm just being impatient, I'll see if they eventually answer.  But judging by what I see at I doubt it.

It sounds like Bitpay allows your customers to pay with BTC and you get USD, right?  Is there a service that does the reverse?  Customers can pay w/Paypal, CC, etc, but I get paid in BTC?

What's a typical cost per kWh for power in a Turkish city?

If I had one, I'd get x-ray images of it.  Happily borrow someone else's if they're interested. ;)

Stupid question department: why weren't they using a pool which allows for merged mining of some alternate coins?
Or now that they're not in a pool, would they consider merged mining?  What are the cons of merged mining?

Nothing matters until it "matters."  If they can show damages (lawyers can be pretty creative IMO), then they have a case.
Note also that they could get an injunction as a protective measure in order to prevent trademark dilution.


And if reddit usernames were a big source of positive/negative exposure for the trademark holder, they'd surely sit up and take notice.  There are fair uses of trademarks, too, btw.

Indeed, bartering is seen (can be seen) as income by the US IRS.

Are fake hashes distinguished from "rejected" and/or "stale" shares?

Ok, but I was focusing on the case when, for example: individuals sell their old refrigerator when they buy a new one.  I've liquidated my asset, but at a clear loss as a consequence of the wear and depreciation.  The money I got is more like realizing a loss than it is income.  Yet individuals can't take this liquidation as a deduction and it certainly shouldn't be considered income.

Please excuse me from the gold shower, it sounds fairly NSFW.

Yes, I think it is different.

But what's the difference between selling goods for profit and selling goods that I own/use in order to liquidate them?

Ditto, 0.05

Silver lining - inflation works out well for those of us who have long term debt like mortgage and education loans.

If my income isn't keeping up with inflation then it's probably not inflation.

What if the exchange rate went through the roof?  1e12 USD / BTC?  How divisible is BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:23:10


If that attack were to occur, it would probably not drive folks to LTC from BTC, it would probably damage digital currency altogether.

Do you live in the US?  I think that just because IANA isn't involved it doesn't mean that you can't be compelled to forfeit the domain.  It's a pretty straightforward case of trademark infringement (for all but "redsox" possibly).

What are "porno dollars"?  Is this some other currency I can try?

@_date: 2013-04-27 12:05:38
Really?  Do they explicitly say so somewhere (either "no bitcoin" or "no alternative payment")?  When Ebay started out at least, I recall it being up to the buyer and the seller to negotiate the method of the payment.  Now it's officially disclosed in the auction, but if you accept additional payment forms it seems like it's not against the spirit of the auction as long as the seller pays the associated fees.

On the bright side, it brings more exposure to bitcoin.  It's really not in the most positive light.  But hopefully folks will be there on and elsewhere to distinguish between bitcoin, mining, and those who would steal cycles in order to mine.
