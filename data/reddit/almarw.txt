1.) Is a wallet on my PC more secure than a wallet on my phone? Thank you for your recommendation!
2.) I see, with in turn has a lot of fees I assume
3.) Yea, I've read about those. Even though bitfinex there wallets look secure as they use cold wallets I still much rather have my own as then it is my own responsibility. At the moment I am considering a hardware wallet. However, I do think it is worth it when I'm only at like 200 euros. So my 2nd alternative is either phone or PC and I'm unsure which one suits me better.
4.) I figured. Thanks for the reply! I really appreciate it

In my opinion people who say BTC will crash are equally guessing what is going to happen as people who say BTC will skyrocket. No one really can tell what will happen, unless we got a timetraveler amongst us.

1. Hmm yea true. Definitely looks cool to have in the future when I buy more!
2.)Thats really nice. And I assume nano ledger S is the most secure out there at the moment?
3.) There is a difference between public keys and private keys right? Hardware wallets use private keys?
4.) Those fees are only transaction fees correct? I was more referring to fees you have when selling/buying on exchanges.

A couple of questions. I hope I do not sound too stupid.    
 1.) I currently have BTC in bitfinex. However, I want to move my BTC out of bitfinex into my own wallet. I have approximately 200 euro of BTC in there. What kind of wallet would you recommend me to use?  (phone etc.)
2.) When I have my own wallet, where can I buy and trade BTC? E.g. I want to invest in other cryptocurrencies as well, will I need multiple wallets for this or is 1 wallet on my phone sufficient?
3.) How safe is a mobile phone wallet compared to holding the BTC in exchange websites? 
4.) Is there any way to avoid the withdrawal fee's bitfinex has?
Thank you in advance!

1.) I read something about this withdrawal minimum. However, I am unable to find it now. I believe it was 250 USD?
2.) Do I have to move it to an exchange wallet or can I directly use my own wallet and sell through an exchange?
3.) Thats is the part I'm worried about. Using a small amount of BTC is definitely useful! Thank you for the suggestion.
4.) Guess I'll have to face the fees then. Thank you for replying! I really appreciate it!

1.) Do you think getting a hardware wallet is worth it when I've only invested like 200 euro in it?
2.) Will definitely look into those hardware wallets! I was already familiar with the Nano ledger, but I always assumed it was only for BTC.
3.) How does the process go of hardware wallets in term of private keys? Is the key in the nano ledger s for example? Meaning, if a hacker would have to gain access to my wallet he'd have to either have my seed or the private key?
4.) Yea I did not realize the fees were this huge... Are the fees avoidable when I use a hardware wallet? (I am aware of unavoidable transaction fees). Thank you for taking your time to reply! I appreciate it
