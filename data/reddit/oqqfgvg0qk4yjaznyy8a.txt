Because coinbase is a business. They want to make money. If they announced it before, other exchanges would take the majority of the volume. Looks like a smart move to me.

Sorry. I think you are missing my point. 
Almost all of the people that claim that they "pay with bitcoin" simply don't, and I argue that they never will if Bitcoin doesn't change somehow. 
Let's imagine that every person on earth, every establishment accepted bitcoin starting tomorrow. And I mean Bitcoin, not Bitcoin backed Visa card that is no different than any other centralized system.
Would you feel comfortable buying a bottle of water at a gas station, knowing current transaction fees, confirmation times and price volatility? If the answer is "no", then Bitcoin is not ready to be used as currency.
EDIT: I forgot about the blockchain throughput. Several tx/s will not fly as well.

The egg came first.
We will not see a mass adoption until it costs $5 to pay for a $1 item.

To be fair. Many of those articles are about why BitCoin can't be a currency. How many of you use Bitcoin to buy your coffee, groceries, anything really? And I don't mean "I did it once 8 months ago".

I googled:
And it looks like what you need is a card that uses bitcoin but pays in fiat. Which is like trying to buy stuff in US with Russian Rubles. You can do it but you need to exchange the money first...

Your government accepts Bitcoin? Where do you live? I can't believe I missed such huge news.

So you are not using Bitcoin to pay your taxes... If I find a person who will exchange horse shit for AUD and then pay it to the Australian government, does that mean that horse shit is a currency? No, it doesn't.
Bitcoin will never be a currency until transaction fees are more than a cent or even a fraction of it.

Confirmation bias. For each chart like that there are 10 wrong ones.

Fun fact: It doesn't matter. FED does anything the government wants them to do. They are separate entity only on paper.
