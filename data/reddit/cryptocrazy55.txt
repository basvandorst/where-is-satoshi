I believe you have to report it on your taxes. If you receive a letter or email, it’s either a scam or you forgot to report it and the IRS found out and wants their money

He’s just asking for help, no need to shill. It’s not even real coin he’s talking about, just testnet

Not a bitcoin link. Just someone shilling some YouTube channel

Just how they write it. Structure and style, knowing what is necessary or that one operation can save two. Stuff like doing it the lesser known way than the common way, resulting in a benefit it elsewhere in the code. Things like that. If you read a lot of code, you start to get a feeling for someone who googles every little thing and takes the first result that works and someone who really knows their stuff

That’s unlikely, considering the site is so poorly built and secured that chrome and safari refuse to connect to it

So, it’s lightning for exchanges? In a sense

So, it’s a website, not an app?

Referral link, also mines doge anyway

You don’t. When using nicehash, you use their pool. You’ll have to use something else to use slush pool

As a crypto guy and an IT guy who has to deal with people who are like that all day, this post was priceless. Thanks

I like that, maybe call LN transactions bolts or arcs too?
Has a nice ring to it, could even call the network the storm cloud

I see what you mean, but any regulation that would kill anything but scamcoins would be bad for the whole market, and is unlikely they would just ignore the single biggest crypto currency. At the same time, most alts are not holding bitcoin back, the are at its mercy, not the other way around
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:46:02
Scam. OP is just begging for money

Decouple from alts?
Usually it’s the other way around, bitcoin falls and alts follow. 
Alts going down should be good for BTC, since most exchanges trade in BTC/alt
From what I’ve seen, alts fall with bitcoin, and lag behind when it rises.

Fake. Do not send funds.

To be fair, they didn’t buy poloniex, they are one of the big investors in the company that bought them

It will slow down, but large transfers will still use the main chain. LN still settles on the main chain, so best case we see less transactions overall or less small transactions

They fork every 6 months to upgrade the protocol. Just like how bitcoin has to fork to add segwit, Monero has to fork to add new features

Any TA or upcoming developments to back this up?
Or is this just a prediction pulled out of your ass to get some karma?

There’s going to be L3? LN is already a huge usability improvement, could only imagine what could top it. Is there any information on theoretical or in development L3 solutions?
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:12:20
Would they ask the same question for traditional markets though?
That’s what I want to know.
