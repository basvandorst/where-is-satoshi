Obviously a logical and well thought out response to the general problem of math teachers who don't know what a logarythm is.

This is absolute truth. As an example, a relative of mine took out a loan of about $180,000 to build a set of double apartments in a nearby town. The monthly payment on that loan is equivalent to the interest, so while on paper he is not paying down the base sum of the loan, his income from the apartments is several times what he is putting out for the interest payment, which is pure profit. Also, the value of the house and land is steadily increasing yer by year, such that the building and property he bought are now worth over $300,000. When he chooses to get out, he can sell the home for more than he paid for it, pay off the loan, and pocket the remainder as profit, just like he has been for the rent.
It cost him $0 of his own money, and he will have made several hundred thousand dollars. He did have to work a lot at the managing and upkeep of the property, as well as the construction, but in terms of money investment it was effectively nothing.

Funny that the same Crisis hasn't collapsed the Stock Market entirely yet. As precisely the same truths apply to it.
That's what Bitcoin is right now, it's a stock option. It is gambling on the value that will be created by a system.

With our current government however and its constant dancing to Washington's tune, I can't say this will continue forever.
I do give them the TPP though, they are at least consistently against all the crazy shit there.
