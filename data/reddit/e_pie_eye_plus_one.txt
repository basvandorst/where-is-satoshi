He is right though.

The problem is that there is practically no liquidity in the bch market.  A bunch of coins going up for sale would dry it up very quickly.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:55:25
I know.  No fucked up is that.  And they are happy about it.  No one sees it as a problem.  Just weird.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:53:20
Yeah.  And supposedly they all met in Bangkok for a meeting yesterday to discuss the current bch clusterfuck.
No one in Bangkok at the appointed hotel knew anything about it.  
I made a post see below, regarding this meeting and Roger replied talking in future tense about a meeting that supposedly happened yesterday.  There is some weird shit afoot.  If nothing else it sure highlights the centralisation issues that bch suffers.

AND the masters are being sneaky.
There is something going on that is being hidden.
That supposed Bangkok meeting was not a meeting at all.
I’d like to know where the meeting was. Reps went to the W and no one knew anything about it.
Bangkok miners were in the dark, not invited and didn’t know anything about it either.
Shit like this is WAY more important than a playing “stress test” from one website. Just another distraction for users.
I made a post asking about the meeting and roger answered saying it is (meaning was??) elsewhere???!!? How fucking opaque could this be?
In other words he spoke in the future tense about a meeting that supposedly happened yesterday.
I think there is some hoodwinking going on.

For sure! Great show!
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:20:45
Bitcoin’s company?
@_date: 2018-08-06 03:57:54
I think he fucked up on that.... there is more sand than gallons of water for sure.
@_date: 2018-08-08 03:19:46
Uh huh.
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:04:36
The last thing I’d do is sell bitcoin for a Lambo.

What’s amazing is the irony of those shilling bch is that they have to trust these 4 mega rich ego maniacs that control the chain and the majority of the volume, to establish their global decentralised p2p currency.  Closed ‘invite only’ meetings and all.
@_date: 2018-10-07 11:36:34
They wouldn’t be on reddit.
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:11:23
Roger essentially does himself a disservice by his incessant ego boosting talking point boredom.  The vast majority of people are turned off by this obvious display of self promotion.
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:29:08
Chill out.  First world problem.
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:31:21
I don’t think he owns 1 bch.  He comes of as being adolescent.
@_date: 2018-10-17 04:53:25
What fud?
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:04:41
You’ll need powerlines.  Usually pretty obvious if going into “nowhere”
@_date: 2018-06-26 03:38:04
How does it work I’d your counter party is a ‘big’ channel and has many connected parties?  Who will receive the counter party funds?
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:57:54
I got banned.  But, probably for gloating when ltc topped bch
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:11:24
He reminds me of Cruise’s character in Magnolia.  Cringe!
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:43:10
Wtf are you on about?
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:21:09
I’ve been “temporarily” banned there for quite some time ~ 1.5 years.  The reason was pointing out that LTC was gaining in marketcap over BCH.  I may have been overly exuberant- gloating even.  BUT - the sub erroneously described itself as censorship free.  Well that’s some class A bullshit right there!
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:47:48
If it’s easier that pay touch and the rates stay stable..... otherwise forget the mainstream.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:19:15
Is not the control over development of the code base in terms of commit responsibility by a relatively small number of individuals a considerable risk to bitcoin’s ability to stay out of the hands of corporate or government control?
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:54:55
Same... banned on r/btc for discussing btc.
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:42:03
Wtf are you talking about?  Off topic?  The problem appears to be getting resolved as we can see from u/jameslwalpole’s comment.
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:25:31
You apparently haven’t been to rbtc.  Check the front page and compare to the front page on rbitcoin, then tell me who is ragging and insecure.
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:11:23
It doesn’t change the fact that r/btc is mega toxic.  I was banned from r/btc for simply discussing btc.  It never showed up in their “open mod logs” which they were touting for a while until it became too obvious what a ban factory the place actually is.

Hi!  I’m travelling to the states from HK, I’d Like to exchange some bitcoin for dollars - how do I connect with a cash transaction there?  I won’t do any kyc steps out of principle and practicality.
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:13:40
Thanks for the hodllhodl.com - never heard of it.  How could bisa help if I don’t have a us bank account?
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:49:06
How do I find a meet-up to an area I’m travelling to but am not familiar with?
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:15:08
Nice aPPeal to authority.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:57:18
Revolute?  Do tell more.
