How do "companies" with their own altcoins benefit when the value of their altcoins go up?

I can see the wall but I guess I don't quite understand how difficult it would be to eat. I suppose I just don't have enough experience to make sense of the numbers. If you want to elaborate it would be much appreciated.

Why do I always have to pay more for BTC on coinbase than what is currently trending?
For example, if coinbase says BTC is at 10500, when I buy i need to pay 11,200.
This happens at any price. Whats the deal?

I'm new to bitcoin. Not a lifelong investor, but I consider myself to be someone with a fairly strong understanding of the tech behind bitcoin and many alt-coins. I bought a small portfolio of 5 top 100 coins to get started on, with the intention of holding, and maybe selling some of the smaller altcoins on a big swing. 
Bought BTC at 14,275 thinking it would stabilize. I wanted to get in before it continued to climb, but now it's looking pretty rough. My concern is not really that BTC is low, but rather that virtually all of the top 50 are in the red right now.
Any words of wisdom or positivity?

Is this the bounce back? Are we good now?

so they have to buy into their own altcoin when it launches, or do they automatically get a percentage at ICO?

what kind of nerd places a sell wall at 11,730

starting to look like buying at 6.5 was the right move

is the general consensus that now is a good time to buy, or should I hold out for it to drop lower? I bought at 11, and then 10 thinking they were good numbers, and it had seemed to stabilize and go sideways for a few days, but....nope, it keeps dropping. Any chance it will go to 7, 6, 5k? I keep hearing people talk about "support" but it seems to not make much of a difference.
