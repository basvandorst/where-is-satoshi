So like bitcoin? :P
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:39:04
It will always be more expensive because of the overhead of decentralization 
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:19:31
yes. it keeps you from selling that information. otherwise every pay per view event could be restreamed by every viewer. and just like you are not allowed to make a website which copies news articles from the Washington post 
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:09:28


I rest my case
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:40:31
Every service you use comes with a contract. You think they didn't put it in the T&amp;C?
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:07:45
If you are continuously moving all your fiat into BC then I would suggest maybe you don't understand money.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:58:35
I like that you think all 1 mill of this sub can just buy $6k worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:10:34
This is a negligible risk tho. Here in Norway there is a government fund that insures any money in a bank account up to $250k per account.
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:41:39
That seems like more of an opinion than a fact.
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:07:42
and in hundreds of years it will be evident that we misunderstood many things, but that does not mean that educated people know less about an area than those who aren't educated
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:05:01
so we should distrust doctors today on the basis of a claim we can't prove about doctors who were nothing like todays doctors?
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:57:00
i can agree with most of what you said here. i just wanted to point out that historians might write that doctors used to do all sorts of weird things todays doctors wouldn't do, but there is still a long way to proving they actually made matters worse.
in fact we will never know. what we do know is that for as long as we have accurate data, educated doctors make you less likely to die than uneducated ones.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:31:14


You are correct, that is what I did.


Many things are limited. The amount of rock on this earth is limited, but you didn't use that as an example. The reason you used gold as an example is because it has been used for money in the past.
The reason it is not a fair comparison is because we moved on to a new system, why would you compare bitcoin to an old system?


That is an opinion. I have the opposite opinion. It is also not relevant in this discussion, since this entire post was made to argue for bitcoins abilities as a currency, not as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:47:16
do you have any stats showing that going to the doctor on average made you worse?
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:10:47
Facts are always correct.
Learning about different ideas of economy doesn't make them all right, of course. But it makes the person more educated. Just like learning a specific painting technique doesn't mean that's the only one you use.
You are arguing that a random person would make better economic policies than a person having studied the field, which makes zero sense.
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:09:43
Yes, but that is not a fair comparison. You could have said salmon, but that doesn't make it any more expensive for me to move MONEY.
Edit: The entire argument for bitcoin and of OP is that bitcoin is a cheap way to move value. My counter argument is that there sometimes are cheaper alternatives. Of course a physical thing is more expensive to move, no one ever argued anything else and that is why we DON'T use gold as money.
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:15:44


This is the stupidest thing I have read in a long while. Holy shit. I guess people with a degree in medicine are worse doctors. Educated pilots are worse than a random person at flying air crafts. Did you even think before writing?


I don't think you could ever argue that a decentralized system can ever beat a centralized system in terms of efficiency. The point of decentralizing is not efficiency.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:05:47
Gold is spent all the time by making actual things out of it and selling them.
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:38:00
It is your opinion that it is both. I argued that it isn't easier to transfer value with Bitcoin, then you responded with claims that it is a value store.
I could also argue that it isn't a good value store, but that is off topic for this post related to transfer fees, so I didn't.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:10:12
Well, gold is a physical thing, which obviously carries more storage costs etc. A better comparison would be sending money between two bank accounts.
If I had 298m in my bank account, I could actually transfer it to someone else within hours (in the same country) for a fee of NOTHING. Is $0.00 less than $0.04?
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:14:20
If you give me 1:1 on below 8k I would be willing to bet.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:01:20
i obviously agree that in specific cases doctors, economists and other professions can be so stupid that they are worse than an uneducated person, but in general that is not the case.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:50:17
This bet would have been better than a short.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:12:59
I would be willing to take you up on this bet. If it is &gt; 14k you win, below 5k I win, anything in between is a draw. Feel free to PM me to arrange it :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:35:32
interesting, what would you say the harmful effects of inflation are? and would you consider deflation better?
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:29:40
that's interesting. which policies do you think are especially harmful? 
@_date: 2018-07-09 18:19:33
So we can conclude there are better implementations of capitalism than the US
@_date: 2018-07-09 10:02:55
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:58:49
The reward is not based on your individual risk. It is based on the collective risk needed to create the resulting rewards.
Meaning: While I only need to risk $1 to win the lottery, the extremely low likelihood of me winning contributes to the great reward.
You could argue that $2 would be a great reward for risking $1, but then no one would risk anything on anything with a success rate lower than 50%. We need people to take the 0.01% chances as well, otherwise we would never be able to build complex things like computers and phones.
@_date: 2018-07-09 10:00:04
It is not the only risk I am talking about, but it certainly is one of them. If we all took the safe route of finishing college and take a decent paying job, then who would be left to invent those jobs?
@_date: 2018-07-01 17:54:36
I literally pay
- 0 monthly or yearly fee for account
- 0 for sending money
- 0 for receiving money
- 0 for ATM withdrawal
I am however paying a small fee of about $20/year for having a payment card, but I am pretty sure Bitcoin won't offer me that for free. I am also pretty sure the banks are about to replace this with free contactless payment through phone.
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:59:42
To say that capitalism is bad under certain conditions, you must show that something else would be better.


Would they not do that under other systems? What mechanics would prevent that?
@_date: 2018-07-11 13:15:28
I think that is ok. Unless they stole it tho.
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:16:57
But I think the world has yet to see a better system at creating value than capitalism.
@_date: 2018-07-09 10:01:27


Sure. I agree, but my point is that it might still be the best system.
And no two capitalistic societies are the same and they all have their flaws. I am just saying that the alternative is most likely worse, when you look at the actual data we have.
@_date: 2018-07-11 04:16:46
How much of that wealth exists because some relative got rich 200 years ago?
I don't think you understand how hard it is to keep wealth that was just handed to you.
@_date: 2018-07-09 08:19:30
It still holds true if you remove the word "physical", though.
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:34:20
Don't both bring value? Capital and workers?
I don't see how a bunch of workers would cooperate on a 5-year research-project to develop a much better industrial machine, and then another few years to build it, without anyone getting paid in the meantime. How would they be able to afford food and housing, not to mention all the equipment they would need to do the research and building?
Same goes for a new cars, large buildings, ships etc. Someone has to take the risk and someone must pay the workers during research and development. And whoever risks their hard earned money on any such project definitely brings value and deserve some returns.
I think that any society without returns on capital investments would never have developed computers - and especially not Bitcoint.
@_date: 2018-07-10 02:16:36
Sure, wealth is consolidated, but not forever. Some person who got rich during his life will probably split his money between his or hers children and relatives.
They will all try to invest this money trying to fight inflation, and some of them will fail due to being bad investors, or listening to the wrong advice, or just spending it because they are lazy and spoiled.
The capital is either invested or lost, and every generation it is divided among multiple people. I am not worried about consolidation in an inflation based system. 
Edit: What I believe the US needs is better anti-trust laws and less corrupt politicians.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:42:31
Same is true for any other currency or investment. Investments grow in percentages, not in absolute numbers.
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:51:41
Also because it would be a huge risk to keep it
