I remember on I mentioned that thw whole thing seemed like a huge bubble and the similarities to Tulip Mania concerned me. Someone's response to that was so it was utterly cringeworthy. They said something along the line of "if you follow the bread trail, there you will discover the answers you seek". You seriously got the impression that, purely because he'd bought at the right time, he saw himself [as this.](

No, he was only 9 at the start of WW2 and 14 at the end? You don't think that's true because of a Youtube video?

Soros is Jewish, you wally. Not only did he not work with Nazis, but there's no way Nazis would have worked with him.
Additionally, he was born in 1930, meaning he was all of 9 years old when WW2 broke out, and 14 when Berlin fell.
Jesus Christ do you believe any and every old piece of nonsense you read on the Internet?

He said that when Wikileaks published DNC donor credit card info, it was "just the last four digits", which was completely untrue and several contained huge reams of personally identifiable information including full credit card numbers.
There's of course the classic of "release Chelsea Manning and I'll leave this embassy", which he chickened out on like the spineless tit he is.

You mean the guy who views privacy as an outdated concept? Fuck Assange, the lying sack of shit.

You mean "mainstream economics and all the evidence that accompanies it"?

Well that proves an asset with literally no intrinsic fundamentals to support a price will never crash ever.
Why do you keep referring to it in terms of a currency when probably 90% of people buying BTC are doing so as an investment, to turn into (hopefully more) real money later?

The Government doesn't control fiscal policy, that's the Federal Reserve. They couldn't do it even if they wanted to.

Interested in economics doesn't = any actual understanding of economics. This is where charlatans and soothsayers slip in, tell people what they want to hear (see: this fucking post) and run away causing endless problems with people thinking hoarding money as cash is a good thing.

If you're referring to the Federal Reserve, it's not privately owned. That's the sort of nonsense that only gets supported in normally next to "it's own by Jews like the Rothschilds who did 9/11 and all wars".

An economic recovery won't see that note growing in value without massive massive deflation, which would kill off any economic recovery stone-dead.

Yeah, this is perfect material right here.

Turned up 2 days late, but I thought I'd point out that there are occasions where non-payment of a debt can lead to prison-time, at least it can here in the UK.
If civil litigation gets to the point where the court orders your attendance, not turning up will be classed as contempt of court which comes with a 14 day prison sentence.
