Right? Makes sense tho. I always feel that Bitcoin "slingshots" the alts to higher levels when it fires upward

You're wrong. Source me with the confirmed denial of VanEck and I'll Venmo you $1,000. 
If you can't source me, then refrain from useless comments like this. You just speculate and spread FUD. This is people's money were talking about so if you don't have any evidence, please, please just shut the fuck up and watch.

I am talking about approval. The market mover is a "YES". Thats all I need. That's the catalyst and I have yet to find someone who shows me otherwise use that the CBOE approval for Vaneck is the ONE that will get approval. Whether that greenlight hits August 10th or September or even February 2019. My research had indicated this is the bulletproof, insurance backed, problems-addressed, application. 
Mark my words. Call me crazy. That application is the one that gets greenlight. I have out my money where my mouth is.

It's not a sure thing. It's so so so very close to 99%. The CBOE, unlike the other requests to greenlight ETF and retail money in Crypto, addressee 4 out of 4 concerns that got all applications denied in the past. The CBOE has a perfect application. This is the one that opens the door. We can't say with  100% certainty thay this is it. But if there were a time for this to happen, man: this is it. I am all in on this bet because it's gonna happen.

Its August 16th or 90 days after that. Not "1-2 years" out. We're months away. Not years. 
Where did you pull "1-2 years" from? Seriously. Where did you get that number.
