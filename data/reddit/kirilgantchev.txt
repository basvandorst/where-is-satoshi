The lenders could report it themselves, we provide downloadable full transaction logs.

I would recommend the following articles:
1. LendAcademy's article:   
2. BTCVestor's review (a bit outdated, but quite fair):   
3. Stu Lutsman's review (all of his blog posts are amazing):

In our first year we've facilitated over $4.8 million USD worth of loans. LendingClub's first year loan volume: [$4.8 million!]( Is anybody still doubting that Bitcoin businesses are here to disrupt? :)

No, your math is correct, you just don't think that we should count reputation loans towards our loan volume. I disagree with you on that assertion, and so do our borrowers and lenders.


I would be happy to enlighten you! :) :) 
When a lender parts with their money they always take the risk, regardless if it's a risk of default or opportunity risk. Frankly, there is risk of default here, it's just that there is no risk of actual loss. So the loan should properly compensate the risk and these loans do compensate for the low risk with a small interest fee. The lenders treat it as a loan and if the borrower does not repay it (for whatever reason), the lenders leave negative feedback. This is an obvious demonstration, to the lenders, that the borrower doesn't qualify for any loan whatsoever. The borrower only needs to run through this demonstration once, which is why we only allow one reputation type loan per borrower.
This is a similar concept to highly colateralized loans or secured credit cards.
**TLDR: if the lender gives their money to somebody, and that person is expected to repay the money with interest (however low), then that's a valid loan, even if the risk of cash loss is almost 0. The opportunity risk is still there.**

Yep, this includes Reputation loans, but they account for 5.78% of last month's volume. Rep loans are a perfectly valid loan: we do have some rep loans that don't get paid back, so we manually have to go and cancel them in order to return the lenders' funds. I know it may seem shocking, but some people don't even pay their reputation loans! Reputation loans may pose 0 risk of default, but there is still the opportunity cost of such a loan, if the borrower fails to pay. 
Furthermore, each borrower is allowed exactly one such loan, specifically so they can demonstrate that (in a controlled environment) they know how to find enough BTC to repay their interest. We've had people post rep loans and then e-mail support asking if they can use a credit card or PayPal in order to pay it off.
Funny (weird?) coincidence, but BTCJam's Chief Product Officer asked the same question :): 
I think the statistics for the last 3 months has been a clear trend of our progress towards taking the market leadership position:  
* March: 35% market share.  
* April: 40% market share.  
* May: 46% market share.  
* June: market leader.
