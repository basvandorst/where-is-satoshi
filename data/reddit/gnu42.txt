It's no "easier" to trust packages from a package manager - somebody still built them and they could have malicious intent - you can't verify whether they built a package from an unmodified source yet. (Although there's work being done to fix that.)
Sure there's less incentive to package malware in linux, because one caught doing so would be rejected from the communities they participate in, which is really a key difference - Linux is backed by communities, where software on Windows is the dictator to the plebs.
Linux is better for security if you take the effort to do it right. The different mandatory access control systems (SELinux, AppArmor, Tomoyo etc) are superior to windows's "MIC". If one has a bitcoin wallet that can be accessed by any software other than the bitcoin client via their user account, it's their own fault if they lose their wallet to another app which could just read the wallet directly.

You should consider that all your perceived problems with Bitcoin are actually with the existing banking systems that you're trying to get out of. Bitcoin is working just fine.

The vowels on "to" and "shi" have the same weight, stress and tone as on "sa" - they are shorter than "toe" and "she" - more lie "to" from "top" and "shi" from "shit"

I think you mean nano, not pico.

Problem with this is when we get to nanoBTC, and use en-bit, the nasal sound makes them too difficult to distinguish in conversation.
Unless we just skip over nBTC and use Satoshis (which will be *exciting* listening to English speakers mispronounce on massive scale. There's no 'toe' or 'she' in Satoshi).
