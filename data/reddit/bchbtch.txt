It's odd that the cheap trolls want to push for Roger as the face. No BCH stakeholders will agree with that segment. He's just a person who represents himself only.

Yup just give up your coins, and then you can use them!

How do you recognize subterfuge, what are the goals of those engaging in it? A well meaning actor could be accomplishing their goals.

Lol, no. Price run up =/= mass adoption. If wall street is getting involved, the first thing they do is make sure they take the fools easy money.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:17:53
It's a theme account yes, but I just post in my spare time.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:37:07
Price is rising because liquidity can't reach exchanges. Bots do the rest, and the plebs throw in their pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:15:18
The blocksize cap does that for you.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:04:40


This point needs work. What are they into it to do?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:58:50
That sucks, which coin did you use to transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:00:27
No, productive trade increases the real wealth of both parties.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:17:54
Bitcoin futures are only a good thing if you think that the fundamentals of BTC are strong right now.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:48:08
Oooh you guys.
@_date: 2018-09-27 03:17:05
Business as usual.
@_date: 2018-10-06 15:19:09


The posters in this thread seem very set on agreeing with each other...
However, any new viewers should know that this statement is insane.
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:03:06
Ok, my opinion is that no one here actually has the visibility into the operations of this private company that would result in useful speculation.
No business in any other industry has a bigger pool of no nothing hacks reading tea leaves and initiating crusades based on the result. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 01:45:57


It's ok to admit that some things aren't known by the general public. Much more productive than projecting paranoid theories.
@_date: 2018-10-06 20:37:46


I'm saying if it looks that way, it probably isn't.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:18:11
Bad reference, idiots.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:32:22
If this is what worries you, you have either an amazing or horrible life :P
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:41:33
Centralized mining eh?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:23:50
So it does feel good?
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:56:05
What is the correct response when bank CEO's are telling you what to do?
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:32:09
This thread is interesting
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:59:25
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:20:06
Oooh no you're going to hodl with a different company?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:14:21
Who actually listens to this kiddie drama?
@_date: 2017-10-27 01:05:58
No ethics at all
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:02:55
That's when we've reached peak adoption.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:16:07
Not free use, no. Just a price not inflated by artificial scarcity.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:12:44
What's the trend your predicting early? Why these two averages?
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:48:37
Glad to see the approved miners are using the approved algorithms in the approved way. Permissionless is too hard, moderation and knowing guidance is needed, and is working well on BTC!
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:11:01
How are you being fucked over?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:18:29
I love how all the sketchy services support 1x while all the professionals trying to grow this economy support 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:17:09
No it doesn't, you're projecting.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:51:18
How would it be weird for people to act in the same way to the same news? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:10:12
You guys are actually crazy over here. This is nuts.
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:01:05
Oh man, this sub is always comedy gold.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:41:55
The trust is implied by attendance.
