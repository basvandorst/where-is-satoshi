You can't use kncminer right now. They are shipping trashed miners, most likely used ones(lots of dust in the fans), pieces are falling off them, the products are packed in static bubble wrap. They do refund but they are slow atm(and no refunds for the Scrypt miner which is worrying). KNC fooled me by all the good rep after their first product but right now they are honestly closing in on BFL as a terrible company. I don't even know if there is a legit bitcoin miner service out there.

But bitcoin had 250+ votes as well... It's not like dogecoin had 5000 or anything

No, it was a "known bug". Whether you could call it a direct security vulnerability, I suppose not, but the sentence isn't bad. He is pointing out that it was known and should have been accounted for by mtgox.

This is not an offensive response whatsoever

It doesn't work this way and the discussion surrounding the betting sounded nothing like a gentlemans wager. You had so much time and so many opportunities to scale back or settle for a lower bet but you chose to be a cocky moron and kept guaranteeing you would pay even if the bet got bigger and bigger.

Just thought I'd add a comment saying not to buy anything from KNC. At the end of the delivery period(Q3) for the Titan I had gotten no delivery yet. So I asked for a refund. They pointed to their no refund clause, and claimed that since they had started shipping "some" miners(to anyone), their guarantee had been upheld. 
I got the miner a month later despite saying I didn't want it anymore. I have a complaint in with  but I doubt it will go anywhere. They(KNC) are scum.

How are there so many comments defending GAW on the article? I don't get it. Guess I'll assume it is mostly GAW themselves just so I don't lose faith in humanity.

Sounds like r/bitcoin

do you have a post somewhere detailing what you think is wrong with current method of studies etc? Guessing you are tired of answering whenever someone asks.

I tried  personally, last update is that it got merged with 8 other cases or something. Their main argument is still that I am a business so I have no grounds, and that the only reason I want a refund is because bitcoin price went down. (this is for the Titan, and yes I was stupid to order it)

But you are nowhere near sane...

Confiscates whole bet if you break rules like forgetting a fee
