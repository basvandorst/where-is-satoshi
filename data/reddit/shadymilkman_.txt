lol why you mad tho?
This code was not made by a "good" developer. I honestly don't know any app developer who would send passwords over a GET request instead of a POST request. It suggests that the person who wrote the framework for mt.Gox doesn't even know the basics, which is the scariest part. It makes me *really* hope that the image is faked.
By the way, my Master's in CS specialization is in Web app security, so I don't have shit to prove to someone who tries to defend the shitty coding from the OP's post. This sub doesn't have formatting for code snippets anyway.

Why are you here?

I fucking hate Bloomburg.

The bottom line is that this app was created by a fucking newb who doesn't even know standard app security protocol. 
As a developer myself, it made me puke in my mouth a little imagining what other shitty coding was happening behind the scenes that's not readily apparent in the URL.

I hate to agree but you are right. Lawsuits inbound. 
No fucking way does it take all weekend just to fix a technical issue for a BANKING SYSTEM. It won't be back up by Monday.

Better it gets fixed sooner than later, IMO.

I think this guy wwebsites as on the internet. Pls be careful OP.

Source? Because salting passwords is retardedly basic and pretty fucked up for a money exchange website to not get right. The more I hear about this company the more appalled I am that people actually use it.

You mean cash they could purchase BTC with?
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:57:14
Not to mention a shitty attitude.

Tempted to buy low, although if you look at the 52wk it really isn't that low. They had a big 2013 surge.

It's an article about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:52:10
How about the article this discussion thread is based on?

Just curious but what site do you use where you can set buy orders for fixed prices?
