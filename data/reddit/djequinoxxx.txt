I realize that. I was talking about miners fees. Doesn’t matter where the ATM is you’re still going to be paying a miners fee.

Watch out for those astronomical fees.

Could have something to do with consensus. A lot of fresh money coming in so that’s why transactions could be taking a while. It’ll take a bit, just wait it out.

Since it’s such a small amount I don’t think the IRS will catch but then again it’s the IRS they can go after anything. As for your dad’s investment, you should contact Coinbase support and explain the situation. Unless you have his login and password then you can transfer it to your wallet without having to go through all that mess. 
Sorry for your loss.

Ok dude.

Clearly you’ve only been on here for 7 weeks. Don’t speak to me like that. If you don’t know what consensus is the do some research, now you just look like an idiot.

If it smells like a duck, looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, well guess what? ..... It’s. A. Duck. So be careful out there kiddos

He’s trying to hard. Had 2 hits back in 08. Just like bow wow is trying to “flex” posting up fake pics of “his vehicles” ��

Lol yeah I noticed that right after I took the screenshot ��

I feel the same about alts. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:53:48
Yeah then it’s probably not worth it. Better off using asic miners

Does this actually work?
