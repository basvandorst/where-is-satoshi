What's your source on this so called energy shortage? Have you seen what solar has been doing for us lately? Imagine the Sahara covered in solar panels! Once we figure out the sand problems, of course.

What the heck is R1? Why not just say $80,000?

 What an idiot.

Why not do that now?

Gubmint can't take my coins
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:50:23
 It's not guaranteed to go lower, nobody knows what can happen. Holding off to buy btc is something people regret later on.

If it was u/tipbot I'm pretty sure it's gone. You have to claim it, and there's was an email a while ago that they were shutting down tipbot and to take your coins out of your tipbot wallet. You should check it though, they might still let people take them out late, who knows.

Try it anyway, you never know! There were several tip bots a while back, changetip, bittip, etc
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:58:48
Wait...this clearly required some technical l knowhow. Are you saying you did all this work and probably spent a bit of money on a device with a purpose you don't understand?
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:20:03
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:44:32
I mean, you said you got $1000 from it, so it's not just a few pennies.

He's not wrong about China, but the military wasn't part of creating the internet.

If you haven't tried guayusa tea, you definitely should very soon. Also there's a 25% discount right now.
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:39:25
No, as far as I know. Guayusa is native to the Amazon, so this company probably buys larges amounts of leaf, packages and ships it. It's what most bulk-product companies do, as far as I'm aware.

Not all bots are true bots, some, like are just real people posing as bots. Other bots are scripted to run without human interaction, like the Twitter bot above.

There are actions you haven't taken in your life that would have ended in your death. Don't regret everything, just keep doing the best you can and try to use your feelings of regret to fuel your future planning.

Cool! Why is there a USAFoods in Australia? I would imagine it would then be a AustraliaFoods.

You can divide a bitcoin into as small as 0.001 amounts. More than that too, but I forget the max.

I'm neither for nor against litecoin, but this sounds exactly like the things that were said about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-09 20:57:52
I buy a lot of things from Amazon. I'd switch to paying with Bitcoin if they did.

Why do you think this off topic?

@_date: 2018-03-17 17:19:39
If the random email spam happens to involve cryptocurrency, and is being sent to users of one of the largest payment companies in the world, isn't that relevant to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-09-22 20:02:10
Wow, my eyes just skipped over the the first going

Alright, I'm gonna actually review it.
You need more time and practice writing. Write more, show your work to more people. Check out for some ideas.
Your dialogue isn't formatted properly, it needs to be on a separate line.
If you're going to sell something as a finished product, at least use a spell-checker first.
Don't throw in sentences of all caps. It's jarring and looks kinda silly.
Don't make your first paragraph an entire sentence. 
Read this whole thing without stopping to take a breath: "*I was a ward of the state. Because of my continual voluntary admissions to the local psychiatric ward in Upstate New York I had been warned by the hospital staff that if I got discharged again and didn't comply with the discharge plans, such as outpatient counseling and medication compliance, they would present my case to a judge who would force me to comply with them by setting me up with a team of people including a nurse and a case manager who would come to my apartment and count my medication and question me about my behavior.*"
Try to keep coherent when you're shifting ideas, locations or just describing quick motion. This sentence is a prime example of bad transition:
The police charged me and screamed "GET ON THE GROUND!" which I did immediately and they were choking me and shaking me and asking me where the gun was.
I would say you have some work cut out for you, don't despair. Work on reading a lot. A **lot**. Reading will give you ideas of what to do, show you how to correctly format, and grow your vocabulary.
I don't want any refund, I'm happy I could review it.

Or you could agree on a set amount of BTC rather than a monetary value. They'd probably never do that, though.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:33:12
As opposed to here stuff.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:02:03
You don't suck. You just need practice. You had the guts to write something, post it online, *and* ask for money ***and*** receive money. You've gotten more for this story than I've ever gotten for anything I've written, so who's the writer here? :)
Go forth and write.
