It would appear CBOE: not quite ready for the honey badger. The established banking and trading world has no idea what they are in for.

May I ask politely if you have any conflicts of interest? Or could we have your sworn assurance that you have no conflicts of interest? If you do have any conflicts of interest could you please disclose them.  Thanks!

 "transportation engineer"? Is that what they are calling Uber drivers today?

Thank you for the information! How does Lightning Labs intend to make a profit? If BCH scales and allows near costless transactions will it be a competitor to Lightning Labs LN implementation?

So what accredited university granted you a BS in Transportation Engineering? I've heard of BS Mechanical Engineering, BS Civil Engineering, BS Chemical Engineering etc, but never BS Transportation Engineering.

Thank you for the answer.   Please clarify:  Open Source does not mean anyone can use the code or protocol for free.  I assume you plan to, or are protecting your "IP" with patents, which would prevent others from using the protocol and opensource code for free?  This is a huge departure from the original code released for bitcoin protocol, where NO ENTITY OWNS IT.  You also did not answer my question:  If BCH scales and allows near costless transactions will it be a competitor to Lightning Labs LN implementation?

Do you appreciate the irony that a government employee such as yourself would own, or have interest in a crypto currency?

That's incredibly unprofessional and manipulative.  An exchange should be a neutral party. They should let the Market decide the course and value of their CUSTOMER'S assets.  Them taking an active stance in markets makes them a virtual insider-  Thus their employees and insiders at the corporation have advanced info over what their customers know.  Are you going to just trust that they do not exploit this advanced market knowledge for their own benefit at the expense of their customers?  The whole point of bitcoin, and a fundamental design feature is that it doesn't require any trust. BitMEX should change their name to BitEnron.

Oh yeah?  I heard about it 15 years ago!

Out of curiosity-  At what dollar value will BitMEX claim the users' "Bitcoin Cash" be sold at? And on what day? You do realize that if BitMEX is going to sell options on "Bitcoin Cash", they need to own them.  You can connect the dots. Right?
