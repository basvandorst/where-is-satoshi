Takes around 10mins on average to find a block. Each block has a reward of 12.5 BTC.

Very few places accept BTC here in South Africa.
However, it can be used for online shopping at  (variety online store) and  (online store with pop culture and technology at heart).
Then of course for purchases on Steam (gaming platform).
Compiled list that can be found online ( 
I however have no experience in trading bitcoins back to local currency, but using the Mycelium wallet's local trader function, plenty of local traders both buying and selling bitcoins showed up on the map.
Good luck!

Depending on your GPU, you could try mining at NiceHash.com.
I rake in about $2.50 ~ $3.20 per day with a single GTX 1080 
(payouts on Saturdays and all in bitcoin)

Somewhat of a thread-jack...
Try selling hashing power at NiceHash.com.
On a single GTX1080 you could get around $3.20+ per day.
Payouts are in bitcoin though, so USD value is kinda relative...

Thank you for your answers. I'll have a look at your service and maybe give it a shot

So this pool, 'miners' included, benefits greatly from the high transaction fees? Would something like SEGWIT and 2MB block size not then harm your business model?

I'm new here, but help me understand how 110% block reward is possible. Where does the extra 10% come from?
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:36:03
Agreed

I mine altcoins in my free time and convert all of the 'profits' to BTC. I thus don't directly invest in BTC, but rather use it as a means of trade as I spend all of it on Games and Gifts.
However, lately with the tx fees being unreasonably high, I lose more than 30% to miner fees. 
I welcome both SEGWIT and 2MB and anything else that WILL reduce fees, as BTC is becoming less and less viable as a means of trade.
Might as well change the name then from Bitcoin to Bitbrick, as all it is going to be good for at this rate is to just sit there and gather dust.

If you have a decent gaming pc, I can show you the basics of mining crypto currency and getting rewarded in Bitcoin on a atleast-weekly basis.

How lucky do you feel?

If by centralised solutions, you mean using BitPay as a merchant to buy from a certain retailer? Then no, not really. These merchants enable us to make purchases at places that would otherwise be impossible. Also the merchant is selected by the retailer and we as users have little to no control over that.
If by centralised solution, mean using the said merchant as a whole to avoid extra fees. Then yes, it troubles me a little. But you need to trust these solutions if you want the added convenience (such as a VISA debit card with pre-paid BTC on it that can be spent anywhere VISA is accepted) that they promise to deliver.
It all comes down to what BTC is worth to you; and how you intend to use it.

I believe this is from a purchase that the OP made. Most likely on Steam or any other platform that uses BitPay as merchant.
But having a BitPay account/wallet/'debit card' could have avoided most of this similar to what you suggested with Xapo and Coins.ph
You still wouldve paid the extra $2 fee if you were using Xapo or Coins.ph though
