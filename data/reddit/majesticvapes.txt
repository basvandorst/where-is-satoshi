Yeah, it was just a dumb move. I had a gut feeling I was making a mistake, but we all learn from them.

I am one of the guys that bought bitcoin in 2013 and I had an ouch, I sold about 100 coins 1 1/2 years ago before it took off. About a month after I sold the coins it took off like a rocket and I could be worth a lot more now. I also did the same with Ethereum. I started buying Ethereum when it was $3 a coin, the same time I sold my bitcoin, I sold my Ethereum. I believe it was $60 a coin at the time and I had a TON more Ethereum then Bitcoin. So Im more or less saying ouch because I can relate in a way. If I would of held on to the coins, my life would be very different, Lol! So I hope I didn’t offend you, it was because I can relate.

Bottom line, just like most advice, don’t invest more then you are willing to lose and you won’t have a problem.  Don’t invest your whole paycheck in a few coins. Take care of your bills, put actual money away in savings and if you have a few bucks over that you would of spent on Taco Bell anyway, invest it. Better going into whatever coin then buying a couple Chalupa’s and then down the toilet. Have fun and remember, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 is in the past.

The last few weeks I have been buying anytime it hit under 8k. I don’t know if we will ever see the price that low again. I feel we are about to go on a bull run for awhile and I am continue to buy if it goes under 8k again.  This is just my opinion, I am no expert by any stretch of the imagination.

Yeah, there was a regular ATM sitting in the store too.  I wonder if they got a bunch of those paper $10 quarter rolls to put all them bitcoins in? Hahaha, fools
