/sarcasm - should have been explicit.

... so what you are saying is that the Canadian dollar is an illegal currency and anyone returning from Niagara Falls with loonies in their pocket is practically a criminal.

Electricity *should* scare people a little more than it generally does. Come to think of it so should currencies - all of them.

Wow, thanks. My first changetip. I'll have to figure out changetip on the weekend.

If you believe Bitcoin is a disruptive innovation it is useful to understand that disruptive innovations often start out carrying significant shortcomings against incumbent technologies particularly in areas most valued by the core customers of the incumbent. (Refer to Clayton Christensen) The Economist article simply confirms this situation. The disruptor will find niche markets where it's strengths are valued (like remittance)  The Economist does not need to approve of Bitcoin, nor does the Fed. No incumbent ever does.

Sorry, I didn't realize how popular C# is. I just looked it up and I think I understand your perspective. That was just my first reaction and it may not be fair.
But Java and Python are perceived as being multi platform systems, so they are sort of open to anyone. I can run C# on Linux (I think) but I feel a bit excluded. 
The real question for you is the overlap between interest in bitcoin and commitment to programming languages.
So, what languages are bitcoiners interested in; and for each of the top half dozen languages how many developers are interested in bitcoin? If bitcoin interest was randomly distributed between C Java and other languages you would be fine. Language usage does not quite follow a random pattern, so you may have found yourself in too small a market through no fault of your own.
The other thing is that many people interested in bitcoin have no programming ability so the whole market may be smaller than you or I might expect. That's one funny thing about "Mastering Bitcoin"  there is no technical requirement at all.
I'll take a look at your book. Good Luck!

It dies every week. That's why we can have a bitcoin "wake" every Friday.

Cryptography II: The Coursera Unicorn
Years from now people will trade tall tales of taking crypto2.

For what it is worth, the book is very good. Not sure what's going on with Coursera.

For all the times when people have tried to make some kind of record of history, it never works out quite as well as you might expect.

I am studying business, innovation in particular. Writing about cryptography and bitcoin. What do you think are the most interesting aspects of the bitcoin community?
@_date: 2015-10-02 02:53:40
I think it is very important for the bitcoin community to pay more attention to the broader currency market. Thank you for posting this!

Did you send them a message? I also had no problem.
