A apology can't solve this brand of stupidity. At some point we all quit using paypal and start over with a company that actually has regulations.

Google could stop most malware in short order with just a few changes. But it's so profitable it won't happen. How many folks buy new PC'S because of infection? Even Microsoft profits.

JP, we will do everything in our power to destroy your empire. Your gains are illegitimate and odious.

Ask Aaron Swartz's parents how all this worked out for their son. The son who is now in a cold grave. We need accountability for prosecutors. Texas has it, apparently New Jersey is controlled by gangsters.

I guess software updates and not using windows 98 era software is too much to ask? Oh, wait, don't want to say that, you might piss off the trolls in finance.

The moment I can quit using paypal, I will. Every transaction I can move away from them, I will do so. Say hello to Blockbuster, Laserdisc, and DIVX for me, willya?

So they can cheat and screw this up too?

Yeah sure, we love to have every cash transactiin tracked so it can be used by our employer, health insurance company, ex spouse, and shit, I don't know, probably facebook too. Privacy? The bank employees make 9.50 a hour, several times I know personally emlloyees illegally released my account details. Management only cares at the receiving end of legal action. Priced attorneys lately?

This is the same guy who sold out to google,  right?  We use adblock edge for firefox. No ads.  Zero. When google et al stops listing software that infects computers with spyware we can reconsider.

The sad thing is most of the verifications any company puts you through can be defeated by a 12 year old's logic. I have to bite my tongue at the bank when they say "you have to have this, and that, because security", when they are too stupid to realize those things don't accomplish what they are trying to do. Go through the motions, satisfy the stupid branch manager, otherwise he will fire us. And our legislators are too old and stupid to even comprehend the problem.

I don't appreciate it when banks make such "inaccurate statements". These days I ask them where they graduated law school, and to provide said statute.
Especially when its a 12 year old twit employee making the statement.
If banks are allowed to make statements on legalities, then they can basically say whatever they please. Sadly, they do this often.

dump those bastards as fast as you can.
