I know, I’m dumb, but when it says block reward of 12.5 bitcoin - that means that person who mined that earned that many BTC to themselves?

There’s really no difference between the ardent teenagers who swear by BTC and the old senior citizens buying worthless faux gold from late night infomercials. They have the same depth of financial literacy.

Ever read the likes of The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham - who has influenced the likes of Warren Buffet? You purchase things you believe have value over the long term.
Guessing ‘what is low’ and ‘what is high’ is just that - and is immature speculation. You have better odds playing that logic at a casino.

I feel dumber after reading this post. 
Surely, BTC will just climb, climb and CLIMB!! The value just KEEPS on coming, at those rates, forever.

Hate to burst your bubble, Captain but even if you’re not a troll, and even if you did get ‘rich’ (a subjective term) - you got there by luck. Sure, you can throw all the complex jargon at how your saw it when nobody else did,’ but you’re just lucky, nothing more, nothing less.
If you were truly SMART, you’d be able to repeat your returns over and over again.
A one off? Congrats bro, happy for you, but trust me, it was luck, not brains that got you there.

You sound so sure about that, I encourage you to invest all of your life savings into BTC. Alllll of it.
