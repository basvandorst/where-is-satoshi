Just checked my bank account and found $150 international point of sale fees. I read this article and I decided to save the rest of my money by buying more bitcoins. Even the interest rate from saving accounts cannot keep up with the inflation. So I'm boycotting the f**king bank :/

I saw that ad. From the places they placed the ad, I think they're targeting noobs and institutions. And what they did is a BIG mistake that will drive institutions away. At the same time, it looks like Gemini is not interested in bitcoin old timers. We all know what regulated means. I hope the twins are not making a bigger mistake than that time when they trusted Zuckerberg.

I bought at 4800 and at 4250. And I just bought at 3300 too and averaged costs/bitcoin. Don't wait offers won't last. We're in black Thursday sales.
Edit: I'm all innnn and I don't care if the price goes to 1000 as long as my savings are not in a banksters hands.

But isn't the point to convert fiat to bitcoin to avoid the need for banks?
@_date: 2018-07-19 00:04:03
Fixed. Thanks for letting me know.

"Customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to bitcoin on both blockchains." 
Total BS. Why the hell didn't he use plain straightforward language? Why didn't he say "customers with bitcoin balances stored on Coinbase at the time of the fork will have access to both currencies or both coins?".
What he originally said implies that coinbase will have only one bitcoin but it will be on the blockchain coinbase wants.

This doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin it has to do people giving up control of their coins to someone else. Not your private key, not your coins.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:57:42
Not your private Key, not your coins. Downvote because it's a common sense.

Read the post again. I'm saying when exchanges get hacked in 2013 people get scared. When exchanges get hacked in 2019 no one cares because people still want to accumulate. The dip is not big when binance news came out because people like me are still buying.
