The dogecoin community is one of the friendliest and helpful communities I've seen on reddit. Extremely generous and they are consistently using the power of cyrtocurrency for good causes. Like helping send the Jamaican bobsled team to the olympics this year.

You could easily pull 30k on LotusTalk. Pretty reasonable going rate currently. Assuming condition is good. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:42:43
I doubt it. I'm not saying that because I hope for one but that's just how markets behave, and it's naive to think that corrections don't/won't occur. There will be another one, and another one, etc. no market has a perfect exponential growth curve. Doesn't happen. The question is always when and how big.
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:59:59
 Is exactly the method I used to contact them the very day my order didn't go through. Would you say I should try resubmitting my issue through that again? The reason I haven't done so already is because it says not to submit more than one form for the same issue. So that's when I tried branching out to other means to seek help.  
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:21:29
Use to be, not anymore. They just revised their policy so I believe you can grab your first coin instantly. As far as wait for the rest of them not sure.

It's their money if they want to put it in with hopes of a high BTC price when they retire that's their deal. Some might see it as a huge gamble and other an wise investment. But really there's is absolutely no way to tell either way. There are people who put their life savings into microsoft/apple and it was the best decision they ever made. But if you asked the guy next to him at the time if he thought it was the stupidest thing he's ever heard then I'm sure he would say yes.

Isn't it CoinLab V. MtGox?
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:39:44
No my order was in fact NOT complete. I can provide proof. The link you sent shows an order of $97. Where in fact I sent you $250 so there's no way that was my order. As you can see... 
@_date: 2013-11-06 03:08:07
Not if you just want to sell them all then no but if you're planning on sticking around it might be a good idea to have at least some safety measures in place for that much money
@_date: 2013-04-16 16:21:24
I have a similar problem I sent you 250 USD to be sent to my MtGOX account. The initial fault is mine in that I put my "exchange number" instead of my "account number" so that's why the funds didn't go through. Realizing my mistake I contacted support with my correct Account number but I never heard back from them and it has been about a week now. Order # a39c5d81-e56a-490f-9a68-8c2dbeb17798
I can give you the correct Account number through a PM if you contact me. I realize there are a lot of people needing help in this forum but if you could please help sort this out. I was actually just about to make a post like the OP when I saw this one.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:20:50
Funny that's exactly what you were doing to OP...


@_date: 2013-11-09 16:07:21
I've been thinking the same thing! With anything you think a correction is inevitable but there has been nothing but good news for bitcoin, more mainstream adoption and as of last night shopify is implementing it into their systems. Which is HUGE. 70,000 stores are run on their system. We soon wil have a vast number of places that bitcoin can now be used to purchase things.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:46:22
It dipped below 300 in the last 7 days, and there hasn't been a substantial increase in acceptance since then so there's every chance it could take another quick dip. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:48:27
Have you contacted their support about this? BTC acceptance is still relatively new so it's possible that the order didn't show up in their pending orders. I'd say shoot them an email if you haven't already.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:12:40
Thank you, good to know! I just posted my order status link to the above comment of yours. I didn't really know if that was all the info of mine you needed to check and make sure it was in your queue to be dealt with or not so let me know if you need any other information from me.
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:45:35
Do you run your store through shopify? I had the same thought for my website except unfortunately through shopify 100% discounts codes only apply to the price and not shipping in there system so it will still prompt them to pay shipping for the product. Now if shopify built in a way to accept bitcoin. GEEZ what a win that would be, thousands upon thousands of stores could then start accepting bitcoin for their merchandise.

That's why you don't cash out. You keep it in bitcoin and make as many purchases as you can with bitcoins instead. It's a currency NOT a stock after all. You can buy that ferrari with bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:19:22
A big correction I think would be the best thing for bitcoin right now! More than ever I've seen and talked to everyday people watching and interested in bitcoin and are interested in using it but at current value most are hesitant to take that leap, a correction down to $200 would no bring in many many more adopters and in turn bring the price back up in no time bringing with it a bigger community and benefiting bitcoin and everyone else.
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:26:09
I think a lot of people get so involved in watching the graphs of BTC price that they forget that bitcoin is a currency not a stock. In order for bitcoin to survive people must spend them, bravo my friend! Excellent purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:18:39
Fair enough, in order to be taken seriously I would include things like that in the initial post. I would talk to the coders you know and ask them what is behind the curtain of say coinbase. How much it would take to make something similar. Your best bet is not to ask anyone on reddit but the professionals you know.

Not a game of thrones watcher I see.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:48:30
That's a good idea. I just figured I'd give them a little time since they said "to be patient." Well I'd say 22 days is long enough for a simple processing error. Time to start "banging on the door" as it were. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 00:18:24
I guess we'll just have to see, personally I think it's likely to drop below 300 again. As far as attacked like DDoS and those like it if a decent hacker wants to cripple a website THEY WILL. Services like that are great when they are taken advantage of, which isn't always the case. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:03:22
Yes that is exactly where I logged my issue. 22 days ago. I submitted the form the first time with the incorrect MtGox account number since I was still under the impression the "exchange number" and account number were the same thing since the MtGox website led me to believe so. Once I realized it wasn't I filled out another form with all the correct info and explained my issue. Again all of this was done 22 days, should I resubmit my issue so I'm added to the queue?
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:03:16
That is exactly why I've been talking about bitcoins for the past 6 months to all my friends. I have a tight group of guys who all went to high school together so we've been friends for many years and always go out to dinner together. I would love for them all to adopt bitcoin and pay each other in bitcoin peer to peer for a meal! With this recent price climb they have really been asking a lot of questions of how to get involved! Soon we will have 5 more bitcoin adopters!  
@_date: 2013-05-03 02:30:04
Ok cool same here. I was worried it was just me. I'm less worried if it's just their website acting up a little.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:36:35
For some maybe. But those who understand bitcoin in the slightest would see it as an opportunity and I've talked to 10+ people who say exactly that. They are jumping in on the next correction.
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:27:03
I just checked my MtGox account and it says that I have $0 and that's where I wanted the $250 sent. I'm not sure what that link is since it says that $97 was sent somewhere but I paid you $250. As you can see here by my order status 
@_date: 2013-10-07 23:41:50
So? How do you think big crime bosses pay for their crazy team of lawyers. If they succeed and get him released he then DOES have access to all his money and therefore CAN pay them. High end lawyers that defend those type of clients are no stranger to seized millions.

My goal is to buy my dream car (Lotus Elise) with bitcoin and can't wait to post it to the forum just like you! I can't tell you how much this post makes me smile. I don't care how much I get down voted if I ever reach my goal I'm gonna post it! Enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2013-06-09 15:09:51
Just made a coinbase account, transferred my bitcoins from my mtgox and linked my bank account directly to coinbase. Great decision. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:32:37
Fair enough, all I can say is when I finally did get in contact with an actual member of their support team I got my money. Why it took so long to do so is obviously something that they should look into for their customers. However I will claim my fair share of guilt in this because the fault was initially my own for giving them an incorrect MtGox account number and then giving them that same incorrect number a second time in my support request through their website. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:28:14
My order status link from your website, as you can see I sent $250 USD. Also my fault was in providing the wrong MtGox account number to begin with that's why the error happened in the first place. "397516" Isn't even the correct format for an account number. I can provide my actual account number through pm or here which ever. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:06:47
That is the first thing I used to try and contact you, and never got a response. That is why I sought out other means to get some help. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:47:37
Clearly they can (to an extent) but there's no denying that.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:01:50
I know exactly what went wrong for me. On MtGox's page when you click on bitinstant to add money it says that you need to use this number...well it turns out that's the "exchange number" but bitinstant actually wants your MtGox account number which starts with an M and you get by going to your profile. So yes it's "my fault" that this happened but MtGox's site is a little misleading and such a simple mistake shouldn't take long to correct. Especially since I emailed support that same day explaining the problem and giving them the CORRECT number. Not sure why it's taking so long or why it's so hard.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:42:53
I really hope they add it.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:45:38
Most the time this comment is absolutely useless. But in this case I agree, an actual exchange is not a simple website you can just throw up. You need some serious knowledge in coding and there's no pre-made software that is geared toward making new exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:47:08
I adopted bitcoin the day before the crash. Luckily only about 250 USD worth was purchased pre-crash, the rest I got after the price drop so that was actually kinda perfect. Still made me rethink getting involved having it burst and have 250 worth of bitcoin be worth less than 100 all of a sudden. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:16:55
@_date: 2013-10-23 21:45:46
Short answer. He has none. Sure he has his own "rationale" but it has just as much validity as those who believe that bitcoin will reach 100k a piece one day.

@_date: 2013-05-01 22:09:14
That would be perfect! This is a link to the specific order status on your website. If you need further info let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:13:50
Yes and no. If you're in the US it takes forever and a ton of fees to "cash out" from mt gox. I heard that they aren't even processing cash outs. So your BEST bet is to buy on coinbase, transfer to mt gox, use their system to day trade or buy and sell on the highs and lows there by making money and in turn making more bitcoins. Then transfer those back to coinbase and cash out that way.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:05:12

@_date: 2013-11-10 01:49:11
That's my interpretation of it. There's no other reason for people to be selling right now other than them expecting a dip so much that as soon as the price drops a little they start selling. China wakes up sees the awesome opportunity and buys it up bringing the price back up. I think sellers will be kicking themselves tomorrow morning. But anyone buying right now will be pretty happy.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:46:57
Thank you I will be making full use of this if I don't hear from bitinstant soon. I've heard of people getting their issues resolved after posting in here so I figured I'd give it a shot.

I sold some on the last drop a week back because of panic sellers. I was so pissed and I hated hitting the sell button but I was like these idiots are going to drive the price into the ground and I'm not going with them. I'll buy back in when the price hits the bottom and ride it up. Unfortunately the "bottom" never really came and it just sky rocketed to 755 today. You just never know what will happen and personally I'd rather speculate on the highs and lows then just sit it out no matter what. You can make a lot of money speculating if you do it right. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 16:01:52
That's a good idea. We should both send a message to shopify as store owners and ask if they have any plans to accept bitcoin in the near future and request that they do. Our words would carry a little more weight than say the average joe.
@_date: 2013-06-09 15:57:06
I do day trade. But Coinbase is still a great way to transfer money directly from your bank account into BTC then if you like right into your paper wallet. Way better than using bitinstant and mtgox they take quite a lot of fees. 250 USD turns into 230 worth of btc which can make a big difference. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:24:20
How did you add a bitcoin payment option to your site? I have my own site which I would love to start accepting bitcoin through just don't know where to start. Right now it is a shopify based site.

What makes you think that a big correction like the one seen 6 months ago can't happen again. It was set in motion by a DDoS attack and then panic selling fueled the fire. That can EASILY happen again. At any time. Bitcoiners are habitual panic sellers.
