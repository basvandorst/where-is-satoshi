My man it appears that Hashprofit.com/en is down and not coming back up. I have about 50$ invested in it and I am severely angry. 
This is my theory on why it isn't coming back up:
The price of bitcoin has dropped to catastrophic lows in this past month. It isn't profitable for them to continue service until bitcoin goes back up to around 280$ to 320$. This is why they either faked a DDoS attack, or they used a real one for an excuse to "restructure and update" the site.
My theory is that it is to costly to run the site and the mining farm in Russia while the Russian ruble falls in value paralleling the fall of the bitcoin price.
This last part about the Russian Ruble falling is in my opinion the largest point that supports my theory. The Russian Ruble is worth .015 USD as of the time of this post. That means that with the fall of the BTC's value and the fall of the Ruble, at current world prices 1 Ruble is worth .000073 BTC. 
The conversion taxes in Russia, all the american's sanctions on the Russian Federation, and the fall in value of both the Russian Ruble and the BTC are the reason Hashprofit hasn't resumed service.
There is one good thing though, the value of the USD is rising while most other world currencies are falling. This is good because now the USD can buy tons more bitcoin for cheaper thanks to the fall in BTC value and the slow, small rise in the USD value.
If anyone else thinks this is a possibility or a viable theory let me know.
