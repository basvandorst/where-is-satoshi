This scenario won't play out, since core miners/nodes will ignore BU blocks and thus keep on living, thus it would be the BTU chain which could possible die.
If you had your coins on a HW wallet, and don't care about the forked chain, you don't need to do anything. Your private keys are safe in your HW wallet, you just need to broadcast your transactions to spend the coins on the desired chain.

Too bad there's a 3% conversion fee for non USD purchases.

Your wallet software handles this, but you could even broadcast a raw transaction by posting it on  or 
If there is a chain split info and tools will be created as we have seen with ETH and ETC.

You're missing how UASF can play a role in this, which doesn't go both ways...

For holding BTC (or BTU), it doesn't matter. Your bitcoins are protected by the corresponding private keys, no matter the wallet. If you have pre-fork BTC, you will have the coins on both chains, both protected by the same private key.
If you want to spend the coins, it's more complicated, since you don't want to be vulnerable to replay attacks on the other chain.

Then BU still has nothing to say about blocksize. If core merges a 2mb hardfork the facts are still the same 
­&gt;CORE_BLOCKSIZE blocks will be regarded as invalid and will be ignored by the network.
BU is irrelevant

­&gt;1mb blocks will be regarded as invalid and will not be propagated through the bitcoin network. BU will be ignored as seen with the &gt;1mb block of recently. The end

Yeah, why no 8GB HF?
The majority doesn't understand the technical implications. Obviously neither do you.

Although I can agree on the misdirection and manipulation part of your post AND on the fact a HF is not a thread to bitcoin, it is incorrect to say that the weaker proof of work chain will be destroyed. You're forgetting the fact that core nodes will not propagate BU blocks trough its network, a BU chain will simply be ignored even it is a longer chain and/or has more hashing power.

51% attacks are merely theoretical. Wait for 3-6 confirmations and you're absolutely fine.

If you spend your coins, you are broadcasting a signed transaction. This signed transaction can be replayed on the other chain (since the signed transaction will be valid on both chains), resulting in you losing your coins on the other chain.
You could avoid this by creating a transaction combining your coins with at least 1 satoshi of post-fork-minted-coins. This transaction will only be valid on the chain you're working on, resulting in the inability to replay the transaction on the other chain.
