"If I were Bitfinex, I would say: there will be no customer losses"
So, you'd lie to your customers, then? If they don't have 120,000 BTC and no clear path to get 120,000 BTC, then why even give a false assurance?
"They can find an investor to fix this"
Why would an investor with $60 million want to sink it into an exchange that failed in its primary purpose? Seems like they could have a brand new exchange developed, from scratch, for a small fraction of that and have just as much upside exposure for a tiny fraction of the cost of bailing out Bitfinex.

Actually, you just topped that comment, which wasn't even that stupid, with your own stupid rebuttal, no offense I wouldn't use that word if you hadn't said it in the first place. 
EVERYONE thinks they're a good trader. Otherwise, why would they even trade? Think about it.
Trading is a near zero sum game (it's not, because the broker takes a cut), between people who all think they're the ones that will come out ahead.
Therefore, nearly everyone trading (maybe not the beginner who truly is learning the ropes) will logically think "I need margin, I'm good enough".

Because that's how exchanges work. Trades don't directly execute on the blockchain, just on the Exchanges books, until the point that a party wants to withdraw or transfer out. If every trade needed to be signed and confirmed on the blockchain, exchanges and trading as we see it now would not exist.

You're a CPA.
If you did a financial statement, yes, you would show your clients bank balance as an asset of your client. That is the money the bank owes your client, payable upon demand (unless its a CD or something).
But those funds are in fact in the banks possession. And they show up on the banks balance sheet, along with all their other customer deposits.
Specifically, the bank has a large pile of cash as an asset (or other investments). That cash came into the bank due to customers making deposits. It owes that money back to customers, which is shown on the liability side of their balance sheet.

Still, *any* claim of **100% security** ought to have sent their CSO or CIO running in the other direction. Even if the Bitfinex hack was nothing to do with BitGo, advertising 100% security is a fallacy, something that can be strived for but never assuredly achieved.

The only problem is this: you describe what Lightning aspires to do, but which is a technology that isn't currently available. 
Yes, a major responsibility lies on the exchange, which failed to adequately secure the coins they were holding. 
But conversely, as you allude to, the other responsibility is on the account holders themselves, who, if they weren't actively trading, might have been treating the exchange as a wallet, and we all know how that ends, because that's happened many times before. 
But again, your solution is based on technology that no one can currently use, therefore not a suggestion at all. And even when it becomes available and deployed, it likely won't work as you hope. Well, again, we'll have to see once lightning arrives and exchanges can rewrite their logic to incorporate it. Really, though, there should be no expectation of total safety unless your coins are solely under your own control. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:14:32
No, if a user is trading their coins on an exchange, the exchange needs to have all keys associated with that wallet so that they can transfer the coins to the new owner, should that person want to withdraw their balance.
Otherwise, you could have a situation where someone makes a losing trade and then refuses to sign off on the transaction. Yes, they don't get to reclaim their coins, but the counterparty, either the exchange itself or the person they were trading with, can't take possession of the coins either.

Have you looked at Financial Statements? Look up JP Morgan, BoA, Citi, any of them.
Here's what Yahoo published for JP Morgan:
$2.3 trillion total assets
offset by $2.1 trillion in liabilities
Those assets are their customers funds (among other things), and the liabilities, is what their customers expect back (the balances on their account statements).
Here's their consolidated balance sheet:
Right their in their liabilities is $1.2 trillion in deposits
They have absolute control of the funds (which is why when the government freezes an account, they contact the bank, not the depositor, because the bank is the one who can freeze funds).
Economic inflow, what does that even mean?
Risk reward isn't transferred? Again, meaningless. Depositors take a risk by putting their funds in the bank, namely amounts over $250k are not insured by the FDIC, and depend on the banks private insurance (if it has any). 
But again, I refer you to balance sheets themselves that clearly customer deposits as liabilities of the bank.

OK, that makes a little sense. It'd seem odd that someone who managed to steal from an exchange would deliver the coins to Kraken though!
Still, it would seem like there would have to be more than some "he said she said" to remove coins from one persons account and transfer them to another address?

When Andreas wrote that book, the blockchain wasn't starved for space, as it commonly is now. If you submitted a transaction, you could reasonably expect it to be included in the next block, maybe two. Now, that's not the case. We can debate the reason all we'd like, but the fact is that the blockchain often undergoes periods of high transaction volume, such that there is no way you can be assured that a transaction will be included in the next block, or even next 5 blocks, at times.
Additionally, waiting for one confirmation is nice, but with only one confirm, you do have a slight orphaning risk - where blockchain.info could report its included in a block, but the miners ultimately end up building off of a different block. Your transaction could then end up in the mempool again, but then you're back down to zero confirms.
Put another way - if your customer comes in and says "I want this painting!" and offers to wire you the money from their bank account, do you:
A) Release the painting immediately?
B) Release the painting after they tell you that the wire has been initiated?
C) Release the painting after confirming to your bank that you've received the funds?
Unfortunately - Bitcoin just isn't ready for this sort of transacting, I don't think. Maybe people felt ok with zero confirms for small items, or digital items that can be revoked, but not for $10,000 items.
Best bet is, if your Bitcoin holding customer wants to make the purchase, they'll be savy enough about Bitcoin to understand the current limitations and your concerns and will work with you on it.
After all, if you give them the painting, you essentially have zero recourse should the transaction not go through. 
If they pay first and you refuse to give them the painting after, they know where to find you and your store, and can file complaints and lawsuits against either, not to mention bad mouth your business, etc.

No insurance company would survive if they were made to pay out on every policy they underwrote, all at once. And no, a company isn't going to deny a legitimate payout. But just because you're paying them, that doesn't mean that your interests are aligned. they've been in business long enough to figure out a happy medium. 
if as you say, their role was simply to offer contracts to customers, and not question or pushback on any claim, nor to evaluate claims to determine what to pay (rather than just pay out what the customer asked for), well, any company that did that would have to charge such high premiums that they'd be uncompetitive. 
Take away the lawyers, actuaries, risk managers, etc and things just aren't going to work how you want them. Why? Because even if you're honest and I'm honest, there are going to be enough people taking advantage that it collapses. 
Even here, in this peer to peer idea, the best outcome pay your premiums into the pool for a little while, make your claim and exit the pool. Not a good outcome for anyone else. But because risks would be so concentrated, you'd be stupid to do anything else, out of fear that your co-partners will do the same thing to you.

It's easy to look up the value of a Bitcoin when you exchange it for something else. You need to be consistent though, you can't pick the most favorable exchange for each transaction, if you're trading your bitcoins for items (transacting with them). 
Likewise, no, you can't take an inflation deduction. Since everything is in the same currency, it doesn't matter. 
Year one, you earn $50,000. 20% tax is due. You owe $10,000
Year two, there has been 5% inflation. You earned $50,000 which is now worth less. You owe 20%, or $10,000, which is also worth less as an expense.

No. The reason for GBTC's absurd premium is that uneducated buyers would rather pay a 30-50% premium to hold Bitcoin in their brokerage accounts than deal with setting up and account at an exchange.
They can justify it to themselves because for GBTC's short life, that premium has always been there, forgetting that for closed end funds particularly (like GBTC is, essentially), premiums can swing to discounts. It's even more dangerous because of the insane amount of that premium - Bitcoin could do reasonably well (~25% this year) and if GBTC ends up trading inline with the value of its underlying assets, that could open the door to sizable losses.

Why should we exhaust all other options first when the eaSiest option is staring us in our faces?
Lightning isn't even a released piece of software - maybe it'll be here in June, maybe it won't be. Maybe people will migrate to it, maybe they won't. And maybe the rest of the ecosystem will rewrite all of their software to interact with lightning, but maybe they won't
Besides, lightning is being pushed solely as a scaling use case. It's got plenty of applicability in other cases, off chain transacting, instant confirms, etc, and can run perfectly as a layer 2 regardless of the blocksize of layer 1. 
Why should layer 1 be held back for any reason? If a layer 2 system can't compete against the base system, it should lose, not just see developers hold back layer 1 until such a point that that particular layer 2 system begins to look more palatable.
None of this should be either/or. What should be happening in a free market / free system is different methods compete with one another and the best one wins.

I think the maintainer of Bitcoin should be a single person "job", and that one person could be sponsored by the greater industry... Coinbase, Bitpay, Blockstream, etc, could all take part in sponsoring them, and at the same time could have their own team of developers on their own payroll to write and submit code. 
Side chains, layer 2 solutions, off chain solutions, etc, should play no part in the evolution of the bitcoin "protocol". If a company wants to build those things, more power to them, but that shouldn't constrain the basic build of bitcoin from evolving.
It's on the network participants to determine the policies, the developers should only provide the tools to get more granular with those policies.
"Fee market"? That should be on miners to decide when and how to enforce. If they're happy with block rewards, let them continue to work that way. If block rewards aren't cutting it anymore, let them announce that they're instituting fees. People can then submit transactions knowing what to expect.
Say Miner 1 has 10% of hash power and demands a 4 cent fee, while Miner 2 has 90% of the hash power and demands a 25 cent fee - someone submitting a transaction could choose their fee knowing this - if they include a 25 cent fee, their transaction should have a great likelihood of being included in any of the miners blocks, but if they only include a 4 cent fee, there's only a 10% chance of it being included in any given block.
That's how economic policy and consensus should be built in the network, not by outside developers dictating their demands and wishes.
As for Layer 2 technologies (since that's the new term, it seems), let them live and flourish. But they should have to compete against the regular client on their own merits, not see the regular clients capabilities be purposefully held back in order to accommodate them.

Hmm... Keep 100% of coins or only 25% of coins, while facing the same issues and penalties either way.
Do you think Bitfinex should do a deal that allows him or her to cash out? They would then know this persons identity, their banking details, and have possession of their coins. What incentive does Bitfinex have to uphold their end of the "bargain"?
How does accepting 75% of the Bitcoins back prevent other exchanges from refusing to do business with those coins? As if they could even know if they were - if the attacker buys, say, a car from someone for 100 BTC, and that person tries to cash out, should the exchange refuse on the grounds that they came from the stolen loot? Then how can an exchange even know if coins that wind up in their possession that originated from those coins "bad" or not bad?
And would returning 75% of the coins prevent the rest of the community from trying to trace the attacker and watching his or her wallet make transactions?
Again, seems like the attacker has two choices. Keep ALL the coins and deal with the consequences, or keep 25% of the coins and deal with the consequences. Not much incentive.

If you're a good person, you could then just hold those coins in a safe place until someone contacts you with proof that they were the sender (a signed transaction from one of the input addresses).
On the other hand, doing so would prevent whoever else has that address from scooping up the coins.

Right, luck isn't dependent on the past, on the one hand. The outcome of flipping a coin is in no way dependent on the prior result. But still, over a longer and longer time period, ratio of heads to tails tosses will get closer to 1:1. 
Same should apply here. Previous luckiness is no guarantee to future luckiness (absent a flaw in mining that we're not thinking of), but statistically, there should be no advantage, so you'd think it would revert to the mean.
Unless the luckiness is due to western miners and the pool having better connectivity than their Chinese counterparts, in which case its not luck at all, but an actual advantage...

It's not for tax/accounting reasons. It's for AML reasons.
Should they get asked by the IRS about you, Coinbase can say "according to information he provided, he obtained the money needed for these bitcoins through X". It also helps them make sure they're covering their own asses
The IRS then, can check their records to see if it matches up.
If you're 21 and you earn $30,000 a year and bought for $1,000,000, the IRS would probably check their records of your tax returns and say "you earned $90,000 in 3 years, where did you get the money for all those coins?"
Likewise, if you eArned the money through investing in other markets, they could check your returns to make sure that story lines up (Schedule D's this time)
And if its through inheritance, at least a sizable one, the money coming to you should show up on a Form 706.
Even mining, you should be able to account for through showing utility bills, etc.
Now, if you just show up at Coinbase, and try to sell a Ross Ulbricht size pile of Bitcoins, and tax records don't reflect any of the above scenarios, you could be in for at least some questions.

With regard to your point 4, it's important not to get too cocky. So many crypto systems have emerged after years of use. Sometimes it's a flaw discovered in the algorithm itself, sometimes it's due to implementation, etc. SHA2 probably won't be broken due to keylength, but that doesn't mean it will always be considered secure. Look at MD5 to see how broken something thought to be secure can be. 
Plus, and while Bitxoin has great minds behind it, it's important to note that either Core or any alternative implantation could get broken due to other oversights by programmers. Brute force attacks, searching the entire key space, are basically last resort methods. 
Will SHA2 get broken? Not saying that. But don't say it can't happen

So basically, SegWit compromises old clients just as badly as, say, BIP101 does, just those old clients don't know they're broken (they get a fake validation script, so assume all is correct so long as all the other clients are upgraded)
Thus is really straining credulity. 
People operating nodes should be expected to run current software. And if they can do that, no only do they not have a problem with SegWit, they also don't have a problem if code is introduced that changes the blockchain at a set date in the future. 
It's no different to anyone but a coder, this argument over symantics.

Just because they can doesn't mean they will


Soft limit and hard limit are two different things. They can, for instance, vote for a one time raise of the hard limit to, say 50 MB (to pick a number), but continue setting the soft limit to 1 MB until such time that 1 MB blocks are constantly full. What's the downside to letting them vote in both places.


so, we need to implement a ton of new code for nodes to run simply for them to vote on a new block size? Isn't that overly complicating things?


Agreed. If the vision is to write, review, and release new code, then wait for it to propagate, then set up a vote, all to change what is essentially a single variable in the existing code. Way too complicated a process.

What are you even talking about?
Why is it a huge chunk of miners and exchanges, dare i even say majority (people with a vested interest in the economy, either through hardware investment or software infrastructure), all seem to believe that increasing the block size is preferable. The miners, especially, who the devs purport to be trying to defend by virtue of creating a fee market for them, seem more than happy with the current block award coupled with a slowly rising amount of fees. And i'm certain they're all aware of the block reward halving.
Increasing the block size isn't "kicking the can". It's letting Bitcoin continue into the future as it did in the past. Now, if Lightning and/or SIdechains become usable and sellable on merits, and people flock to those, then awesome. But to say this 1MB limit is preordained, and that people that thought there wouldn't be contention for block space so soon (after only 1 block size halving), that's not expecting a bailout, that's expecting Bitcoin to continue to progress exactly as it had been explained it would here, on bitcointalk and nearly anywhere else until all of a sudden Lightning came up. That's the best as I can tell.

The US claims he committed crimes in the US. They presented their evidence to Thai authorities who agreed. 
In general, you shouldn't expect to be able to commit crimes in one country and get off scittfree if you get to the border, unless you happen into a country with no extradition treaty. Even then it could be iffy - when presented the evidence that a suspected serial killer is within their borders, a country without extradition may not extradite that person, but they're also no obligated to shelter that person either. 
What's funny in reading the complaint is that it neatly omits that his name and location were in the public record already, and he's already been (allegedly) attempting to make contact with the FBI to turn himself in.

Satoshi sent via IP address because the client used to have functionality for one node to initiate communication with a second node (by sending to IP address), and that second node would then generate a public/private key pair and a new address for the sender to send coins to.
Regardless of how nitpicky you want to be, though, the common term for transferring coins from one address to another is called sending. That's how its referred to in bitcoin wiki, on here, by devs, and anywhere else you can think. Regardless, it's the commonly accepted term by everyone except yourself, apparently.

Compared to what we have today, where you can send bitcoins to any address and not worry about if its going through a compatible path or not.




Seems that only well capitalized operators will be able to host payment channels. Banks, essentially. Or Bitcoins renaming of that type of entity. So given that there will only be a few well used routes, where exactly will the "rest of the network" be?




Network DDoS against a few hubs halts almost all payments
"Most likely". You can't argue against a concern with an answer that you don't even know if going to be implemented. And the idea of trying to "censor" bitcoins based on where they're being sent to is absurd - no one can blacklist an address from receiving coins. Or at least they can't do so effectively, being that anyone can create any number of addresses. That there are so many "well known" addresses, shows that people are unfortunately not using bitcoin as it was designed to be.
But given that censoring recipients is impossible, but what is possible is censoring sending from an address. A channel operator could say "oh? Your coins are coming from X? Sorry, we got a letter forbidding us from processing transactions from that address".

Lets hear it for decentralization, with all the mining done in China and all the nodes running at Amazon, Backspace, Google and Microsoft!
@_date: 2015-12-22 10:44:53
I think the falloff in full nodes is simply due to the appearance of light weight wallets. 5-6 years ago, if you wanted to own or get bitcoins, you had to run Bitcoin-qt. today, you don't have to. Pretty simple. Hence, people who originally had no interest in running a node aren't forced to any longer. 
I'd also say that the increasing use/utility of Bitcoin, reflected by the number of transactions on the blockchain, has increased its value bringing more people into the economy. Given that mining pools and farms aren't going away, the mining side of the network has gotten more decentralized as the value of the economy has grown. If you look at the division of mining power on the network, it's much more spread out now than it was 3, 4, 5 years ago, because there's so much more value there. A long time ago, ASICMINer owned 30% of it. More recently ghash.io got 50%. Now it's more evenly divided than ever, with Chinese farms, mining pools etc, and that's because of the increase in value spurred on by the use of the blockchain. 
And lastly, if resources get constrained for many current nodes due to bigger and bigger blocks, that should be a GOOD thing.  We can't have a global payment network if the infrastructure is hobbled so much that it's forced to be able to run on raspberry pis with SD cards forever. Nor is decentralization helped by keeping the blockchain so small thAt a node can be hosted run on some of the smallest VPS' available. I mean, do you consider it decentralized when tons of nodes are running out of the same VPS providers? That's only a few "cease and desists" away from seeing a huge loss of infrastructure. 
So decentralization or resilience. I think resilience should be the goal. Not to have as many nodes as you can just because you can, but to have a still large but maybe not as lArge network of nodes hosted on machines that can handle current and increasing transaction volumes. 
Almost anyone can host a node, 50 gb isn't a big commitment to anyone but a Pi user or VPS user. So, if an increase of requirements pushes the off the network, sure the total node count goes down further, but maybe we shouldn't even be counting them in the first place when figuring out how decentralized we are

When I look at  I see that 4 pools combined control over 50% of the networks hashing power. Hardly decentralized as it is. If that number were to drop to 3, what difference would it really make?

@_date: 2015-12-22 15:15:03
Even the blacklist is meaningless.
Your coins are on blacklist? Move to another address. No big deal. Because, as you say, not everyone would adhere to a blacklist, even if it were imposed. Individuals might scoff at it, for instance. And a company in Panama, Belize or the Turks &amp; Caicos Islands might reasonably belief that they have no obligation to follow US demands for a blacklist (just as the latter is a popular Asset Protection haven). 
And, again, random individuals can run full nodes, but should be prepared to make a minimal investment of either money and/or knowledge to do so. After all, they're acting to try to protect a $7 billion asset. So, if the ability to run a node on a Pi with a SSD card goes away, and they have to buy a hard drive instead, that doesn't strike me as too much of an investment to have to make. Likewise with the hope of running a node on a cheap, resource constrained VPS or droplet, where even if they're fully in charge of their node policy (refuse to implement blacklists, should they ever even be created), the plug on their server can simply be pulled should they refuse to comply.
Each of these, I think, are second rate citizens in the "node ecosystem". Their existence looks good when you're counting up the numbers, but that's all they do - make the numbers look rosy.
I'm seeing 2 TB external USB drives for less than $80, and 3TB internal for $100. Is that really too much of an investment to ask the people who are trying to secure a $7 billion dollar network make? Considering that that hardware will be usable for years and years into the future.
I'll reiterate. I think it's foolish to try to scale the bitcoin network DOWN in order to let anyone that wants to run a node, on however inadequate of hardware as they might have, to do so. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:55:50


That's why no one's honestly putting forward a suggestion of changing that line to:

And instead have looked for simpler solutions than introducing tons of new BIPs that completely alter how bitcoin works at its most fundamental level and how users actually interact with it, in order to accomodate a technology that's only a white paper thus far.
So, again, I'll ask, where in my understanding (above) of what a new Lightning based network will look like am I wrong?

Are you saying that anyone that supports Bitcoin should do their best to try to DDOS and otherwise sabotage Bitcoin related services? Because, unless they're sufficiently hardened, then they're of no use any anyone. So yeah, I'm thinking you're calling for every Bitcoin related project to be attacked in any way possible.
More seriously, yes, you win. XT can't work if 1% of nodes and miners use is. It doesn't take a DDOS to determine that. Those attacks we plainly meant to scare people back in line, just as Coinbase is now being threatened with, not just by DDOS, but removal from Bitcoin-related pages in the name of "coercion". Very amusing, all the talk on the Github page from the people who want to keep bitcoin decentralized in order to keep it censorship resistant. It's very enlightening, I'd encourage you to go read it.












Miners previously stated they were fine with 8MB blocks, not 20MB. And many signed statements indicating that they would support a move to BIP101. That they're not mining XT blocks currently only means that they're waiting for consensus, not that they're against it. Again, considering that they stand to be outright attacked for stepping out of line at any but the last possible moment.
Given that most nodes are running outdated software, I can't give much credence to their importance in this "vote". Which is the entire point. Everyone is up in arms about a potential hard fork because nodes that don't upgrade will fall off the blockchain, while introducing code that, if nodes don't upgrade, means they'll be unable to verify transactions and may as well not be part of the network in anything but in name only.
As to your last point, well. Some would say there's clear bias.

Are you worried? 
I mean, besides the obvious solution to this, Moores Law (as more and more storage is moving to chips than platters), If I'm not mistaken, hard drive capacity has grown at a rate far faster than transistors have shrunk. 
And even if consumer storage capacities don't keep up, enterprise storage will certainly have no problem keeping up with the demands.  And if by 2035, every 20 MB block is chalk full of transactions, then doubtless transaction fees will allow for mining farms to invest in adequate storage. 
Not to mention pruning. The while a few entities will certainly keep the full blockchain alive, no reason for it not to be pruned in nearly every application. Unless someone's studying the past, there'll be no reason for all the sayishidice transactions to be replicated everywhere, nor nearly every empty address.  
I know thats not the proper terminology, but hope you understand my point...
@_date: 2015-12-22 15:38:07
Not going "agro", you're being very informative!
Yes, I didn't mean to imply that BIP101 breaks anything. Just to hear certain members of the dev team say it, hard forks are bad because people who don't update their clients will end up on a wrong blockchain. But soft forks are fine, even if it means that people who don't update their clients become vulnerable to new attacks that they wouldn't have been before (due to BIP 65, BIP 66, and soon SegWit, too).
Those threats are deemed "fine" because clients can just update to the latest code, which of course will also be announced heavily here and every other bitcoin forum. Which would mean that hard fork events should be fine as well, as they would also be heavily promoted, if not even more thoroughly, since the community would recognize that services not updating would be left behind. 
Beside the symantec difference, the end result seems essentially the same between hard and soft forks. Hard forks shouldn't be viewed as any more or less drastic than soft forks, at least for people who don't bother to update the code they're running.
Isn't there a messaging feature in bitcoind or bitcoin-qt, which allows either Gavin or Theymos to alert the node base of critical events to insure they get messages that are critical? Couldn't that be used to push messages saying "Attention: on or around XX date (block YYY) your node will no longer stay on blockchain. Please plan to upgrade accordingly"
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:49:54
Why would Core users attempt to fake that their running XT, therefore showing support for a direction they don't want Bitcoin to go?  Makes zero sense. 
If you want a 1mb blocksuze, you'd vote for it by using Core. If you want a 20Mb block size, you'd vote by using XT. Running Core but reporting yourself as XT gives everyone the impression that the change is supported, but guarantees a messy fork, when it could go smoothly if that's what the majority desire. 
Or you do that, the fork occurs and you stay on the old path. Since the fork will only happen if 75% of nodes are reporting they can handle the change, mining pools will likely gear up to support the larger sizes when they see support increasing. Then the fork happens, you stay on the old one, the "original" chain, which turns out to have much less hashing power behind it than before...  
Why, what is the point?

That sounds like a cherry pick, honestly. No masking that Bitcoin has suffered a huge price decline for a year and a half now, even if you can find a few dates during that time frame that BTC was higher. 
Definitely a pink elephant. 
When was the last mentioning GBTC? Huge excitement in the run up, it's gonna change everything, even more after IPO, people saying its huge premium represented what people were willing to pay for safe storage of their BTC, but once that premium eroded (though, it's price level is still far too high IMO), how many mentions have there been? Zero, I believe...

So, rewrite the protocol to pay node operators. 
Currently, we pay a fee to send a transaction. That fee is trivial - the only way that miners operate profitably is by the block awards. So the only way to insure miner profitability in the face of declining award is to allow them to process more transactions in the same amount of time. These are people who have invested significant capital to operate and protect the ecosystem. 
His solution is the inject layer upon layer of fees to be collected by nodes for providing minimal services. Not minimal, but services we've come to take for granted. 
*End users want their transactions to reach miners.*
*End users want to receive information about their wallet balance.*
*Miners want to receive fee-carrying transactions to include in blocks.*
*Miners want other miners to receive their blocks, and want to receive the newest block.*
So, rather than just paying q transaction fee to insure a miner processes your transaction in a timely manner, now you'd get to have to pay a fee in order to even get that transaction to a miner. 
Miners would have to pay fees to receive fee carrying transactions. And once they solved a block and wanted it propagated across the network- another fee. 
Malarkey. 
First off, this would require a wholesale rewrite of Bitcoin, just to achieve what we already have. It adds layer upon layer of fees to the process, and serves only to enrich node operators, most of whom have made minimal actual investment in a cheap VPS, raspberry pi or second to third generation hardware. 
The more I read about this debate and the "plight" of node operators, the more I think it's a red herring. We need nodes to broadcast transactions to get to miners and to propagate the block chain, yes. I'm not seeing any reason why pool operators, large miners, businesses that utilize the block chain shouldn't be able to handle that. If others want to join up and run nodes to help, more power to them. Just know you're providing a public service for which you won't be compensated. Not like the expense is too extreme; a pi with an SD card can be gotten for less than a $100 to do the job. And should we get 20MB blocks, then those that want to continue supporting the network will have to spring for a hard drive, which ll yield years and years of useful service. 
Or, rather than introduce a hardfork to the blockchain to allow for 20 MB blocks, we could instead introduce a hardfork to do everything he wants it to do, in order to stay with 1 MB blocks. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:03:16
I don't think it's the miners that are pushing back against bigger blocks. They shouldn't be; with another halving coming up, and absent a huge increase in the price of Bitcoin, there's a big fork in the road coming up, where either they'll need to collect much more money per transaction, or else be able to fit many more fee paying transactions in each block. 
Unless I've missed something, I don't recall reading about any miners actively against an increase. Maybe Luke-jr is, but eligius is a tiny pool these days. The big 4 in China are for it, albeit smaller scale (8mb vs 20). 
Those against seem to be node operators, insistent on being able to "support" the network on the cheapest physical hardware, or cheapest VPS, that they can find, along with a group of devs who are worried about theoretical attacks. The chain isn't being spammed to deaths currently, but allowing bigger blocks would somehow cause that. Centralization fears seem like a false worry honestly, in that I feel confident that a large enough number of people will be willing to invest in a hard drive for their Pi node or else will upgrade their VPS to the next largest package. If we go from 6000 full nodes to 3000, I can't imagine that would be the end of the world...
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:21:26
If we're going to limit the network to running on the most underpowered computers out there, whose operators can't be bothered to do anything, well, that's not good.
I can't wait til we see an Atari 2600 running NetBSD trying to be a node. Should we scale the block size down to 1 byte to accommodate that individual?
@_date: 2015-12-19 21:17:35
So, say, the voice of Bitpay or Gemini or Eligius (namely, anyone that holds other people's coins for even a second) should have more weight than the those they hold those coins for? In that they could simply delay releasing coins until after a vote.
So, not miners, who actually make the blocks. Not node operators, who validate and relay those blocks. But simply people who hold coins at the arbitrary snapshot in time that you decide to hold a vote? 
Seems like it could be better thought out, no?

You can't scam chemistry. 
Get the official measurements of the 1 oz coin you're looking at, if it weighs an ounce but is off by even a 1/2 millimeter in any dimension, you're looking at a fake. And if there's any question at all, you can always have it smelted. Kind of hard to trick that way. 
Alternatively, tamper proof or tamper evident cases could be utilized as an additional protection. So long as the coin is encapsulated with such case it's trustable, if not then it needs to be re melted. Kind of like how banks handle gold bars currently; if the bars chain of custody is only among trusted parties, they'll accept it, if that chain is broken, it's suspect and needs to be forged anew. 
Either way, it doesn't take rocket science to determine whether gold is tampered with or not. If anything, modern counterfeiters probably have a much harder time passing their stuff off than people did in old times, before we had refined technology and methods so much...

If miners and nodes were in the business of choosing which blocks they will and won't propagate, then they could band together and effectively shut out competition. 
" oh, that block came from Ghash.io? Let's ignore that one"
Which could turn into 
"That block contains a transaction that spends these "bad"coins (or which sends coins to a "verboten" address), let's ignore that)"
Get 51% of the pools colluding in that way (China's big 4 miners control 60%) and Bitcoin would fall to pieces. Get less than 51% of pools doing such and it has no effect at all.

if you're going to judge interest in a tech based on the number of nodes, then I'm sorry to say, but Bitcoin is a miserable failure - there are less than 6,000 nodes, and probably only half of them run the latest software.
Thankfully, there's ways to participate without operating a node or losing money running a miner. Which is how 99.99% of us do it. And just because we don't run nodes or miners, it doesn't mean that we have no interest in the direction this project takes.

I just don't see increasing the block size as reckless, that's the part that I've been stumbling on throughout this entire debate.  
The network is already fairly centralized. 
As block awards go down (and there is another halving coming up soon) those miners, centralized as they may be, will need additional transaction fee revenue to continue making financing their efforts at protecting the blockchain. Unless we expect them all to continue their work at losses, either there needs to be a huge increase in transaction fees, which could have the effect of lessening the number of transactions, or allow the network to accommodate more transactions. 
The argument I hear is that bigger blicksuze mesns that people that run nodes would have to eventually increase their storage capacity and potentially their network speed, and if they cant, then they'll drop off the network. 
From my angle, it's the miners who support the network, not the nodes. The nodes just relay transactions to mining pools in order to be passed on to miners to bundle into blocks. Those miners have made significant investments in hardware and software. Whereas node operators seem to think that they should be able to support the network on any old piece of hardware they come across; could be a cheap VPS, s brand new server (that'll be extremely under untilized), a few generations old desktop or a Raspberry Pi.   
I don't know what to call that, but I don't think supporting the network should be taken to mean using throwaway hardware that was gotten for negligence cost. If someone truly wants to support the network, they should be prepared to make more than a minimal investment. We're not talking much... At current growth rates, how long do you imagine it'll take to fill a 3TB drive? 
That's my opinion based on what I've read here, mostly. I would love to get a clearer understanding of what I'm missing, if I'm missing anything, that is! :)

How is adding a mechanism to reverse transactions once they're sent not a consensus change? You mean simply because the block chain still gets recorded the same way it did before, so people aren't forced to upgrade their nodes to stay compatible. Sure. But in every other way but that this looks like a major deviation from consensus that we all understood
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:02:08
Wouldn't the question then be, if botnets provide ample security, does it matter what the source of the POW is? So long as Bitcoin has value, they'ed keep mining it, securing the network, and maybe not bothering to send spam anymore (i add that second part only slightly sarcastically)
Setting aside that peoples computers were highjacked, it seems like Bitcoins value will always be linked to the value of the hardware used to secure it, because all it would ever take to dismantle it is another attacker deploying the same amount of hash power, plus 1% additional.
By letting Bitcoin POW run on general purpose CPU's, that allows every user of a computer, phone, tablet, cluster, etc the ability to mine and secure the network, not just a walled garden of a few. 
The only issue is that large attackers would already have the hardware in place to mount an attack. But if that was something that was being planned, then attacking Bitcoin with its current level of POW hardware in place would likely be trivial to most state actors and probably many corporations as well.
Just throwing a random thought out there.

Should we wait until there is an actual scaling issue, then? At which point code would get rolled out and deployed as soon as possible, with everyone not making the change immediately being stuck on a dead fork? Or should we roll out a change now, before it becomes a pressing issue, and give nodes, miners and pools ample time to upgrade their software, minimizing the likelihood of people being left behind?
Obviously the first choice is best. Let's do nothing until it really is an issue. That's a far better choice than looking down the road, spotting a potential issue and attempting to navigate around it so that it doesn't turn into an issue. 
Come to think about, that's exactly how Y2k was handled. Companies didn't do squat until jan 1 2000 and all their systems blew up.  As I look out my window and look at the wasteland outside of it, I wonder, "why didn't they look ahead and fix that code before it became an issue..."

You forgot to continue the circle: 
Pools have no power because miners can redirect their hardware to support a different pool instead. 
Miners have no power because they depend on users valuing the coins at high enough levels so that they can make a profit from their efforts. 
Continuing, users have no power, as pools *could* selectively blacklist any given UTXO, they could go on strike and not allow any transaction to process, or anything in between.
It's a great circle. Everyone thinks they're the most important piece of it, but truly each entity is extremely dependant on every other one.  At the end of the day, though, and looking as objectively as I can (not being a miner or pool operator), I think it is the pools who possess the most power in this equation. And as time goes by, those pools will be replaced by vertically integrated mining entities, where there won't be a worry about individual miners exerting choice is which pool they operate within. 
Consolidation is coming. Thinking little things like the size of blocks will somehow prevent that doesn't change that fact. Ultimately? I won't be surprised if a few years down the road, there only exist a small handful of mining entities, having extinguished the others from the field. And after that, the most efficient player will go on to monopolize the market, that's what I'd put my money on at least...

I keep hearing conspiracies about how larger block sizes will let the big pools kill off the smaller miners, as if small and independent miners even exist anymore. The move to ASIC caused the huge centralization we see today, and the network hash rate is "deterrent" enough against independent players making much headway. But really all it means is that current and future pools will have to pay for decent connectivity, and really, maybe not even that. Run the internet facing node on a VPS, and it can have a connection that's far more than adequate for an almost negligible cost.

*The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale.  That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server.  The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.*  **Those few nodes will be big server farms.**  *The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don't generate.*

Not being a developer, my mindset is that when in doubt we should refer back to Satoshi's notes on Bitcoin. Seems to me that people are intent on grossly overcomplicating what should be a relatively simple system, in the name of what?
A peer-to-peer form digital cash that allows payment directly from one party to another without intermediaries or trusting third parties. That's what I took Bitcoin. Now, we have constant talk of side chains, proponents of off-chain transactions, many people attempting to make determinations of what sorts of payments are and are no appropriate to be recorded on the blockchain, etc.
And all of those seem to be put forward in hopes of avoiding "centralization", by keeping the blockchain at a small/"manageable" size, where anyone can host a node with minimal outlay - currently a Pi with a tiny SD card is capable, as is nearly the cheapest VPS configuration... If "supporters" of the network are only willing to do so by making barely any outlay, I'm not sure how much support that actually is. Is it too much to ask or hope that such supporters could spring for a TB hard drive, which might or might not get filled up in 3 or 4 years? Even if the full-node count fell from 6,000 to 1,000 as a result, and without doing scientific studies, my feeling is the network would still be sufficiently decentralized. 
As far as Bitcoin (and nearly any other system) goes, having full functionality yet being too simple is never a risk, but becoming too complicated absolutely is a risk, which is what I see most of the other suggestions for increasing BTC's capacity as being...

Yes, but the argument of scarcity is you holding a pie and saying "I'm sorry, this pie is in only one piece, it's scarce, therefore I can't share" when all you need to do is slice it up. 
The media, and bitcoiners, refer to bitcoins 21 million scarcity thing as if it's in such limited supply, and 21 million does sound like not too much, but that's only due to where satoshi placed the decimal point in his creation 
Had he followed the lead of most other currencies and stuck to two decimal places, we'd have a currency will 21 trillion whole units, same size pie, but when people claim scarcity, people would start scratching their heads. 
M2 money supply is just about 12 trillion, doesn't sound scarce, right? But if we created a new unit, the Bitbuck, which itself encapsulates 1 trillion dollars, we could make it sound as if the Bitbuck is incredibly scarce, there's only 12 of them....

The reason for the automatic rebuy is that many of believe that no matter how awesome people think Bitcoin is and that everyone will use it, there's a chicken and egg situation, where merchants won't think to accept Bitcoin unless they see that people are actually transacting in it, and the masses won't want to check it out unless they can spend it. 
If you're reading this right now and want Butcoin to get into orbit, let alone the moon, you're an early adopter. It's on you to transact and show the world why Bitcoin is valuable and why they should want to use it.
Buying it and squirreling it away into paper wallets, while thinking it should be adopted and spent by everyone else, that would work if everyone else was actually spending it, but they're not. Most are held in hopes of future appreciation and trading purposes.
so, if you think spending Bitcoin is pointless because you lose the benefit of having used a credit card, why wxactly should anyone think it should have any value at all? Or, why should we hope that others will drop their credit cards to use Butcoin instead?
Now, if the Bitcoin economy was already humming along, merchants signing up left and right and seeing their business steadily shift over to Bitcoin, then, great! Store your Bitcoin under the mattress in anticipation of gains one day. We're not there though, were in early adopter phase, the only way to get from here to there is to put our Bitcoibs where our mouths are and use them as we hope they'll be used everywhere one day. 
My opinion. 
But I recall back to the BFL debacle; some people bought machines with BTC while others bought with CC. Bfl delayed shipment for a year plus, btc went up in value. People who got sick of waiting, especially once other options became available. Those that paid with BTC found they were locked in, couldn't get refunded, while those that paid by credit card or PayPal, if they made enough noise, got refunded. In fact, so many refunds came through that BFL couldn't accept those forms of payment anymore. 
After that, a lot of people said they'd only consider buying mining equipment if they could pay by CC. Which I found ironic, one of bitcoins biggest feature (no chargebacks) became the reason that people investing in securing the Bitcoin network and earning Bitcoins for themselves used for refusing to buy that equipment with Bitcoins.

Bravo on the effort. I hope you get your bounty. 
I find it amusing that this even had to be done in the first place; only on this sub do people suspect those that don't agree with them, or worse, question Any aspect of Bitcoin Itself, are either sock puppets, trolls, or (paid) shills. 
Who would honestly, aside from the guy that posted the bounty, really think that anyone would go so far as to create a ton of socks just to pump up votes of posts in order to influence the "public's" opinion as to what size blocks the blockchain of the future should be able to accommodate? I mean, even if successful and everyone on reddit thinks one way, ultimately they have no say... It's ultimately what the core developers choose to do. 
The amount of effort to do that, vs... Well, what would the reward even be?!?  Why not use those socks and that time to at least pump Bitcoin to the masses, drum up more interest in it, not just lobby on some technical matter?
Made no sense. 
I'm glad this matter can be put to rest. Unless you're just a pro 20MB block co-conspirator, that is.... And I swear, they're everywhere you look, the only explanation has to be that they're all sock puppets of Gavin's, hoping to push people over to BitcoinXT, and once everyone is using that, he's going to slip in a patch that awards all transaction fees to himself!!

No one single developer took over.

How does Bitcoin prevent those with more resources from wielding them to the detriment of those with less resources? It doesn't. Thinking that the government is the source of all power, that the rich couldn't subvert power to do their own bidding if not for having a government available to subvert, that's fallacy. 
In old times and modern times, be in feudal estates with lords and serfs to warlords fielding private armies and, yes, coercing the populations in the areas they control, people are plenty capable of wielding power over others without needing a government to grant them the power to do so.

What part are regulators missing?
They're well aware that their regulations have no effect on the protocol, but they can be used to coerce cooperation from registered business entities and individuals that are utilizing it. It's like a carrot and stick approach, except the carrot is simply "we'll leave you alone and let you keep operating"
Purely digital businesses, are likely beyond reach, by virtue of being able to lay down roots anywhere they want. Crypto-to-crypto exchanges, for instance, can run on a VPS or real server anywhere, with an IP address that makes it seem to be outside of US jurisdiction. But businesses that connect to the real world, exchanged that connect to the banking system, payment processors, etc, need to have real world links somewhere - listed officers and directors of a corporation, signers on bank accounts, etc. sure, they could do all this in a jurisdiction outside the U.S., but if they intend to be outside the purview of US, and near world wide, banking regulations, then they'd have to situate themselves in a country that's locked out of the financial system. 
Too many people think that Bitcoin, by its decentralized nature, puts it beyond the reach of established rules and laws, and point to failures to prevent certain actions as "proof". Laws and penalties don't stop "crimes" from occurring, just as outlawing murder doesn't stop murder, they just define the penalties one faces if they get caught violating that law. 
So tell me, what are regulators failing to grasp?

So then corrupt miners will be forced to send a set number of transactions to themselves each block? They lose no money, since they can specifically include those transactions in their blocks. Even if they included fees, they'd lose nothing because they could just keep those transactions for themselves. If it's 5 txs per block or 1000, a corrupt mining pool could include however many that threshold is at no cost to themselves. M
That creates bigger blocks, but has no other effect.

 in a few years, I think pools themselves will be things of the past, replaced by integrated entities like ASICMINER was originally and which KNC has become. Should that happen, there won't be many miners left (as a percentage of the networks hash power) to meaningfully vote by directing themselves toward another pool. 
That's the problem with ASIC's, there's a potentially huge barrier to entry, and so far miners have been able to get access to them only because the manufacturers allow them to, absurd  prices/markups. Should they do away with that "goodwill", then there goes the Age of Independant Miners. Contrasted with if mining used an algorithm that could run on commodity/non-specialized silicon. As many have pointed out though, any activity as simple and specialized as mining is can likely be reduced down to an ASIC, so there's not really a solution to this...

This "which transactions are broadcast to the network" argument is baloney. Or bologna. 
From my reading of it, Bitcoin was envisioned as a peer to per system for making direct payments, wherein wvery payment was to be recorded on the blockchain. Not some payments. Certainly not having the majority of payments conducted off chain in a companies database wherein that company would periodically settle up and synchronize it's transactions back to the blockchain. 
These things are new "inventions", the only reason I can see them existing is if they had been put forward by people with vested interest in seeing companies and services that handle such transactions. 
To me, the default, what we should be aiming for, is for people to be transacting on the blockchain wherever possible unless they actively choose not to for whatever reason (privacy, transaction speed-ie trading). But trying to mutate Bitcoin, or push it toward the goal of having it be economically unviable to transact on the blockchain, that flies in the face of what Bitcoin was understood by many/most of us to be

I don't get why you should assume growth of the blockchain decades out, but not factor in the ongoing growth in storage capacity per dollar. In 30 years, we certainly won't be relying on 2015-class storage systems; its not hard to imagine that 50-100TB storage will be within everyone's reach by that time. 
My first color Mac was a Mac quadra 605 that I got (I think) in 1994. It had an 80 MB hard drive!  Some years later, I remember buying a matched pair of 1 GB drives, which was amazing. 
Now? 20 years later from that Quadra?
Well, I returned to the Mac, in part. I've got a MacBook Pro with 256Gb of solid state storage, and a little 1.5 TB USB powered external drive.
Then I've got a Tower running Centos. Its drives are getting up there, age-wise so I'll have to start replacing them soon, but it's got 80 GB or so of SSD, along with 6 TB of storage among a few drives. 
But just looking at single drives. 
In 1994, 80 MB on a single drive was around the mid-range, at least of SCSI drives. By 2014, 1.5 TB on a single disk is in the small side. Who knows where we'll be by 2030, but we'll certainly be leaps and bounds ahead of we are today, so we shouldn't tether a future looking tech to be forced to operate undw today's conditions forever and ever.

Absolutely. Right now the reward is the motivation for mining, the fees are a pittance. When that changes, when the reward makes up the minority's of income then miners will be trying to scoop up as many fee paying transactions as they can. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 14:48:09
Isn't the answer obvious?
If you have 500kb blocks and even just 501kb of transactions every 10 minutes, you're going to see a steadily growing backlog of transactions that never get put in blocks. Any one person can hop to the front of the queue by upping their fee paid, but only at the expense of someone else. Eventually, people could be willing to pay astronomical fees and still have know surity if their transaction will make it into a block. 
That's why the simple answer of "just pay a bigger fee" doesn't work. Well, it works individually, but not if everyone reacts that way, which they would, because you end up in the same exact spot you were in in the first place.

Originally, I wanted to ask if there is a method on blockchain.info to get a longer list of blocks along with the number of transactions and the block size, rather than just the 6 most recent blocks that BC lists. Doesn't have to be BC, any other site that can provide that info would be great as well.
But as I was taking this shot, I stumbled upon a second question, namely block 361769. One transaction, relayed by antpool, and not only that, but it's older than the block preceding it. I'm assuming that this will be orphaned, no? Why would BCI even bother displaying a block that's obviously in error (someone could mine a block without bothering to gather transactions for it, in order to get a headstart over other pools, I understand that, but its age seems to be a give away that something isn't right.
Assuming that, I'm really just looking for an answer to the first question, a method of seeing the size and number of transactions for a much bigger range of blocks than the 6 that BCI shows.

The $8 per transaction figure is the amount that miners are compensated for solving a block, divided by the number of transactions in it. 
Supposing that mining has entered a cut-throat, low-margin phase, which we can probably guess it has due to the leveling off of difficulty growth, then that represents the amount that miners need to earn per block in order to keep the lights on, replace burned out hardware, earn a profit, etc. 
As block rewards decrease, either the price of bitcoin needs to increase, or the fee per transaction needs to increase. Alternatively, the transaction cost could stay low if the number of transactions increased astronomically, but that would require being able to accommodate more transactions per block, which has set off a whole other argument by itself...

Seems like lightning, by my reading, would be incredibly complex to integrate seemlessly into a wallet. I mean, a wallet is used to send coins from point a to point b (I know that's not technically how it works, but in laymans terms). Any participant can have a Bitcoin address to receive coins to. 
Lightning adds a huge layer of complexity on top of that, where to send to someone via lightning, you must first move the coins to a payment channel, and then send. Not just any payment channel, but the exact one that they're using. So, if I'm trying to send to Alice, I don't just say "I want to send coins to Alice", I say "I want to send coins to Alice using Bobs payment channel". Or, more accurately "I want to send coins to Alice via Blocksteams channel". If my coins are at Coinbase in their payment channel, I can't just move them through lightning to Alice, first I have to move them to Blockstreams channel. I suppose that blockstream and coinbase could have their own channel open to accomplish this, but every channel that's open requires someone to tie up their coins in it, and with coins being a finite resource, we can expect every channel provider to be willing to have a channel permanently open to every other provider, and only the most well capitalized entities will have good "connectivity" to other providers. 
Seems like we'll need a separate wallet for each payment channel we intend to use, or each channel provider. Which is incredibly different from today's wallet analogy, where coins in your wallet can be sent to any other payment address at a click of a button. 
I don't want to get FUDish, but it also seems that payment channel providers would have the ability to approve or disprove of any transaction going through their channel, which would be a blow to censorship resistance. No, they may not be able to confiscate funds, but people trying to send from a "bad" address would then have to transact on the blockchain at a much higher cost than if they were "allowed" to use lightning. 
Please correct if I'm wrong. If lightning is to become a fully integrated part of Bitcoin, we all ought to have a full understanding of what that future will look like.

If lightning catches on, there is nothing to stop nodes and pools from enforcing a soft limit, just as they did to keep blocks at 750kb max for so long. 
In other words, just because XT provides for a huge increase in blockspace it doesn't mean that that space will actually be used, especially if technology comes out that makes it unneeded.

I think nodes have very little to do with network centralization, compared to pooled mining.
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:41:51
And C) this obsession that people have with being able to run a full node on consumer hardware, I disagree there too. Once upon a time, people could mine with CPUs, then they needed more specialized hardware GPUs to stay competitive, and now on to ASICs. Most will argue that this is good for the network, that the security gains outweigh the loss of profitable home miners. Same should go for the blockchain. 
Important thing to note is that even after upping the hard blocksuze limit, your consumer hardware will still be capable of acting as a full node for years. No impact in the short term. Medium and long term, supporting the network should mean willing to make the necessary investments to provide the needed infrastructure, not lobbying to constrain its growth simply so that you can throw commodity hardware at it. That's selfish and short sighted in the extreme, I think. 
EDIT: if you're truly concerned about "efficiency" then Bitcoin isn't for you. No other system in the world needs or requires 6,000 layers of redundant storage. It'd be interesting if the blockchain could be broken apart so that, say only 10% or less of it needed to be stored on a given computer, but using 210 TB to securely and redundantly store 35 GB of data is nothing close to efficient.

Thanks for the quick reply though... You replied so fast, that I hadn't had time to actually post my question yet! :)
@_date: 2015-06-01 04:06:15
Are you worried? 
I mean, besides the obvious solution to this, Moores Law (as more and more storage is moving to chips than platters), If I'm not mistaken, hard drive capacity has grown at a rate far faster than transistors have shrunk. 
And even if consumer storage capacities don't keep up, enterprise storage will certainly have no problem keeping up with the demands.  And if by 2035, every 20 MB block is chalk full of transactions, then doubtless transaction fees will allow for mining farms to invest in adequate storage. 
Not to mention pruning. The while a few entities will certainly keep the full blockchain alive, no reason for it not to be pruned in nearly every application. Unless someone's studying the past, there'll be no reason for all the sayishidice transactions to be replicated everywhere, nor nearly every empty address.  
I know thats not the proper terminology, but hope you understand my point...
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:35:37
A) I think the flaw is the uncertainty. We have competing goals in mind for the future, but without a leader to choose a path, the risk is that people who might adopt Bitcoin or the blockchain will opt for a project with strong leadership, who can layout a roadmap for the future and get the project there in a timely, orderly way. 
B) the problem with side chains and off chain is that you're forced to relinquish control of your coins. Off chain means your coins are part of someone else's pool, and they adjust balances with database entries. Side chains could be entirely different coins altogether. I thought Bitcoin was a peer to peer, permanent payment and transfer system? If you receive money in an off chain transaction, those funds can potentially be reversed, compared to the permanence of the blockchain. 
And side chains... I remember when people spoke of litecoin playing a role as silver to Bitcoin being gold. People scoffed then, but now so many people seem to want that in order to keep bitcoins blockchain small. If a coin like litecoin is capable of handling all these transactions, what is the utility of Bitcoin? Just to transfer large sums around? Any alt Can do that. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:43:47
Yes, but currently no one seems to be using that ability to refuse to relay blocks created by pools they don't like. Miners *could* start doing so, but they haven't been. 
The closest I can see is Luke-jr who seems to refuse to let his pool include transactions that he feels are spam, but doesn't refuse to relay or build on blocks that contain those transactions themselves. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 04:48:08

Even during a depression, one needs to be able to exchange things representing future value. A farmer only harvests their crop once a year, they can't then trade that for goods and services they might need in the future, especially without knowing what those might be. Either you need a strong government to enforce contract laws, or you need a mutually agreed on value store, so that you can trade your goods and services as they become available, and acquire goods and services from others when you actually need them. A depression doesn't change that at all.

True. And I'll give you that Bitcoin has a seemingly bigger and more involved developer base. But just saying that while flaws eventually get seen in open source projects due to the "many eyes" concept, those flaws can linger for astonishingly long periods. A flaw might not even look like a flaw until it gets exploited, for instance.
And yes, openssl has much more complex code to manage. But i just hate to see people rest on their laurels and say "it's open source, we're good". It's great for big active projects, but the gpg developer recently had to actively raise funds and bring to peoples attention that he was, in fact, the only person actually working on it.
Again, bitcoin is different than that currently. But who knows what the future will bring.

Cash has first mover advantage though. It's already ingrained in our psyche. And though briefcases can be exchanged in back rooms, cash is far more traceable than Bitcoin, it's physical, takes up space, has a smell, etc. it's kind of hard to obscure the fact that you have $10 million in cash without it being buried in the back yard, and difficult to re-introduce it to the banking system without declaring it, save for laundering which exposes you to criminal penalties.

Dangerously large pools existed, but everyone was on more or less equal footing financially if they wanted to participate. 
Someone buying 1 GPU would have a fixed cost and a set power draw. Someone else buying 100 GPUs might get a slightly better price on account of volume, but their economics would be more or less the same. 
Look what's happening with miners. KnC anybody?  It's not commodity hardware, and though ASICs have been reaching willing buyers, the manufacturers get to play with the cost, insuring themselves maximum profit (either keep the chip for themselves, or sell it for the amount they'd expect to earn if they had kept it.... Production costs are minimal, but end users are effectively locked out of the market in ways they weren't when mining was done on GPUs.

But generally, you can't tell anything just by the amount of leverage or derivatives on the books. You only get clarity by seeing the exacts, which regulators see, not us.

If someone was going to attack the network by spamming it, why aren't they doing so today when it would take trivial effort and money to accomplish (witness's the stress test). But they're not. Why would they suddenly start if the size of blocks were increased?
This is something that the anti-20mb crowd has been bringing up over and over and I just don't see the risk they're talking about. If anything , if network spam is the eventuality they're worried about, isn't the answer to increase the blocksuze to make such an attack economically Infeasible and less likely to cause disruption to the network?

She didn't throw out that argument. She just pointed out that in order to claim a privacy interest in the server, which would mean he'd have to claim ownership of it.

Kind of. He could have claimed ownership in order to claim his privacy interest, so while judge and prosecutors would "know", it couldn't have been disclosed to the jury unless he himself took the stand. 
Instead, what, knowing the mountain of evidence the Feds had by virtue of his snatched laptop, he Denies the server and embarks on a "I created Silk Road, but sold it after a few months" strategy?
Tldr:no catch-21. He could have claimed his privacy interest with zero negative repercussions for having tried that route, even if it failed.

My reading of OP's post seems to be different than everyone else's. Yes, any wallet or wallet service allows you to create addresses whenever you want, that's not the challenge. 
What OP is wanting, I think, is the means for a payroll processor to be automatically stocked with addresses, so that each paycheck goes to a unique address, rather than always being sent to the same address, in an automated manner. 
My suggestion is that payroll processors that release bitcoins to employees ought to have a login where the employees could add a long list of addresses, that way each pay period, the processor would just select the next address for the payee; if the payee didn't input enough addresses, then it should send a reminder email, but also allow the user to specify if the coins should be held until a new address is provided, or released to the last known good address. That seems like the simplest solution in my mind that could be automated on the processors end. 
Another thought I had, question really, is for wallets like electrum with their deterministic keys, it would be interesting if a user could generate a code to pass to the payor which would allow them to deterministicaly generate ONLY the public key/wallet address for the private keys that the wallet will generate. That way, for instance, rather than providing your contact with a wallet address for them to send coins to, you'd give them the public seed, so that whenever they wanted to send coins to you, they would be sent to a new "fresh" address. 
Obviously that's not feasible in this scenario, as it would require the processor and all payees to use the same wallet software, but something like that would be a huge step forward in helping providing some semblance of privacy by doing away with address reuse. Not a complete solution, of course, but just an idea. 
Sorry, got a little off topic there. It was something that I've been wondering about for some time now, and it "sort of" aligns with OP's question, just on a larger scale. 
But for payroll processors, having them let employees provide an unlimited number of addresses rather than a single address would be the solution. Rather than store their wallet address in the "employees" table, make a related "employee wallets" table... Straight forward, only problem being if employee loses control of a private key after providing the address to the processor.

How about having wallets just ask you to enter the amount you want to send twice to verify? So if you type 3 and 3, your coins send, 3 and 30 they don't. And if you should happen to type 30 30 when you only meant to send 3, then forget it - you weren't meant to have those coins anymore! :)

With perhaps a million users, having 1 out of every 10 of them being a full node seems just a LITTLE overkill. Let's see the network reach 50 million users, then we can start worrying about whether there are enough nodes or not..,
Nodes are needed, yes, but I'm thinking that people have begun placing too much emphasis on their importance at this stage. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 12:51:19
Absolutely. 
The first sentence of satoshi's white paper explains that Bitcoin is a peer to peer system for making direct payments rather than relying upon intermediaries. Now, we're being told by many that we're going to need to transact off chain or on side chains, etc. 
I feel like with out a leader, Bitcoin has absolutely lost its direction. Problem is, the community won't accept a leader. It satoshi were still involved, People would likely defer to him, but no one else has that air of "authority", or what have you  
I've been reading satishis old posts on bitcoin talk recently, and as much as I hate to diefy the guy, he had a clear vision of where he wanted to see this go, and did a great job at foreseeing what the future would have in store. Everyone should refer back to his writing, I think. 
He certainly felt that blocks would get bigger, was supportive of hard forks specifically to accomplish that, and suggested a way to accomplish that which we all seen hung up with now. Namely, roll out the code in current revs but defer it's activation until a set block height further into the future. Heck, he even included code in the client to receive broadcast messages to let people know that they missed a vital upgrade and are on the wrong fork. Of course, if he resurfaced today and introduced a client that would support  such a feature a couple years down the road, that software wouldn't be allowed to be mentioned on Bitcoin.org...
The node issue I still don't quite get, honestly. Again, reading his notes, he believed that the only people running full nodes would use them as the front end to mining farms and pools.
Just is frustrating. Bitcoin has potential, but more and more over the course of this debate, it's seeming like a leaderless project is not the way to go. Everywhere else we look, we see projects, companies with leaderships that can guide the product toward a goal, and this is something that Bitcoin sorely lacks. 
Maddening. Somehow, people have succeeded in over complicating what should have been a simple design and goal. Allow people to transact directly; using a global, trusted ledger. That's all Bitcoin was. 
Years ago, pwopke said that litecoin could be the silver to bitcoins gold, and they were Roundly laughed at and criticized. Today? We need side chains!
Years ago, and even currently, people explained that Bitcoin transactions were free of censorship, today people say that certain transactions don't deserve to be on the blockchain at all. 
It's insane. We need to go back and remember what Bitcoin is. It's a payment system, plain and simple. Every transaction ought to be on the blockchain, not just some of them. That is what the project originally envisioned, that's what we were sold on, but today a handful of developers have highjacked it and attempted to turn it into a far more conplicated system, when KISS should be the only acronym we aspire for. 
This whole saga would make for a great dilbert book.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:38:16
Who knows... But certainly 20mB blocks will give plenty of breathing room for years to come. And should the size eventually need to be increased above 20, the volume and popularity of Bitcoin will make the choice a no-brainer. 
We just need a solution that can get it to that point. This infighting over what was originally conceived as a short term choice Iw a real problem and is demonstrating a real flaw in consensus-only development. 
Other projects and companies have had leaders who could envision their goal or destination and drive the project to get there, which Bitcoin has lacked. I'm talking about a Linus Torvalds, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, etc...at least Gavin is finally stepping up, but who knows- the devs and community have been sold on this consensus driven thing for so long, I really fear for what could happen if everyone sticks to their guns... To an extent, it'll be the mining pools that determine which path to follow. 
All I know is that concepts such as not every transaction "deserving" to be on the blockchain, and that what we need are side chains and off chain transactions, this isn't what attracted many/most of us to Bitcoin.

Who are you to judge? If so and so wants to send $50 to their friend in another country, and western union charges $5 and th blockchain costs $20, Bitcoin effectively has zero value to that person. 
Th point of cash is to be able to transfer value from one person to another. Even if you look at the transaction from the outside and see it's only worth $5, that's like a days wages for so many people in the world. Maybe you want to omit them? Or maybe put yourself in their shoes and imagine a time when one day of your wages isn't deemed worthy to be transacted.

I know why they do it. It's just startling that they even attempt to do so. Post after post, article after article, all demonstrate that for the retail end user, mining isn't a money maker. 
It's a moneymaker for vendors who develop and sell ASICs. And it's profitable for mining operations who either develop their own asics or who but in such large quantities thAt the ASIC vendors margins are next to non-existent. 
But otherwise - it's said over and over, it you want Bitcoin, your best route is to buy it. I didn't believe that at first, thinking " well, if I buy a miner and bitcoin appreciates, I'm golden"
But say a miner costs an amount if dollars equal to 1 Btc, and is expected to return .75 btc over is lifetime. Even if the price if bitcoin quadruples, yes, you'll make money on a fiat basis, but you'll still be behind where you could have been on either a fiat basis or a bitcoin basis had you just bought bit coins directly.

It's pretty hard to send to a wrong address. If you mistype a letter or two you'll fail the checksum and coins will go nowhere.

I recall it on slashdot many years ago, that anyone who spoke against the party line was immediately bashed as being on microsofts payroll. I was accused once or twice, to which I'd say "I wish Microsoft was paying me to write this stufff"
Likewise here. I've been reading more and more complaints about trolls "infiltrating" the boards here, but try as I might I don't see rampant trolling going on. Well, I saw Western Uniom get trolled by a bunch of bitcoiners, but that's all
I'll freely admit when I see irrational exuberance, I try to add some realism to it. Does that make me a troll? I hope not. But if it does, then rest assured, no one is paying me a penny. 
I suspect there are a whole Loy more people like me, who like Bitcoin but think that thrre are too many blind cheerleaders in  the community. AgJn, maybe you mistake them for paid trolls, I don't know. 
I do know I read a lot of threads in this sub. I've never noted anyone accuse anyone else of being 5'2. Nor hsvw I noted anyone dragging another redditor wife or ex-wife info a conversation.  Makes me wonder if you're overstating this thread if trolls?
I'm sure you could make a private community to discuss Bitcoin, where you could mantain the membership list and be the arbiter of who can or cannot read or comment. You could even yank people's credentials who didn't toe the party line. But I'd have to wonder if people would be getting accurate information from such an echo chamber? Doubtful. 
Keep doing what your doing. If you're getting attacked by trolls. So be it.  No need to call a timeout and bemoan the trolls. If anything, if theyed real, all a thread like this would do is let them know that their efforts are having an effect and they should try harder.

Should developers see that his code, or other implantations of thT code, is getting adopted at scal3, they can hopefully roll out revisions to their software that will activate recognition of larger blocks by a certain date or block height as well. 
People who don't will, yes, be left on a different chain, but such events have happened in the past, an upgrade causing a fork. In one case, people needed to upgrade to stay compatible, in another, there was a rollback.
Point is, it's not without precedent. If notice is given in advance, devs can ready their software to handle the change seamlessly....

So kind of like what happens when someone gives a paper wallet to someone else who either loses it or doesn't have interest in Bitcoin? Those coins become trully lost, unless the giver retained the private key and scoops them back without knowing if the coins were trully "lost" or not...
If anything, this is an advantage over Bitcoin, where given enough time, a huge percentage of coins will eventually become irrevocably lost. The current system allows "lost" funds to eventually be recycled back into circulation.

Why shouldn't a paypal account be risk free? We pay PayPal their processing fee ostensibly for the protections they provide. Just as I use my credit card because of both the protections it provided and the rewards they give. That is the entire purpose of credit cards (compared to cash, checks or debit cards)
I would vote that you a page from the collective wisdom of the Bitcoin developers and early adopters - NEVER sell an irreversible payment instrument (Bitcoin) for consideration which is reversible (ie PayPal, credit card, check). It's really that simple. 
thete are plenty of avenues to sell Bitcoin for cash, eBay just isn't set up to be one of those venues. 
if you buy gold from me on eBay, I can ship that hold to the address that eBay has verified as being yours, and if I ship it to that address, eBay will protect me in case a scam was being pulled - say you were out of Towm and your house sitter got ahold of your eBay and PayPal credentials. You dispute the purchase and im out both the money you that gets charged back And my gold. But since there was no way for me to know I wasbeing scammed (after all, I sold gold to a buyer with a positive feedback history And shipped it to the address that every one of that buyers previous purchases were shipped by ton. In that case eBay has my back. 
Next, same situation, Except your house sitter messages me on eBay asking me to ship to a different address. If I ship there, even with tracking, and you despute the charge, I'm out of luck. Reasoning being that if a hacker could get in your account And bid, they can also send messages, but they can't change the mailing address for you that eBay has marked as verified. By me shipping to a messaged address rather than a verified address, I'm taking on risk thAt eBay won't cover. 
Now for cryptos. The transaction is all electronic and until or unless eBay starts maintaining a verified Bitcoin address for each buyer, there is absolutely no way them to verify that the shipping info that was provided to me actually came from you, or if you are in control of the address that was sent to me. 
You dispute the charge and me showing that the transaction occurred on the blockchain does nothing to bolster my case. It shows I sent coins to the address that was messaged to me, but not that those coins were sent to you. 
This is Why eBay should be remiss about allowing the sale of crypto currencies on their site, except where usually safeguards they put in place are meant to protect the buyers, this time it would be to protect the sellers. Because whether it's a buyer filing a dispute with PayPal or with their crrdit card issuer, it's far too easy for a seller of cryptos to wind up the transaction with neither money in hand nor their bitcoins. 
So what if they shoulder the risk and allow the sale of cryptos for payment via PayPal? Then every person with stolen credit card info will flock to the site and buy as many coins as they can get. Sellers transfer the coins to them and then credit card holders dispute the fraudulent charges, causing dozens or even hundreds of Bitcoin sellers complaining and dragging their name through the mud... "I sold my bitcoins on eBay, only to have the payments charged back months after the sake. eBay/PayPal totally screwed me." 
The system they set up works great for physical products but it is abysmal for virtual products. That's the logical outcome. I think that people who Dream of selling their coins on eBay for PayPal "applied some additional logic", they would see and understand why what they are asking for is a complete non-starter.

Guarantee the guy gets charged back. I tried selling a few fractions of a coin on ebay, thought i found the best arbitrage in the world, buying from an exchange, selling on ebay; only problem was that when it was all said and done, 75% of my sales were charged back. Thankfully, i only spent a hundred or two on "inventory" to test the waters.
Selling BTC on ebay seems tantalizingly easy, and it looks like people will pay HUGE markups, but the problem is the people that buy either do so knowing that charging back is a cinch, or, more likely I think, people just hack ebay accounts with Paypal and buy up as many BTC as they can find, turning extremely traceable money in paypal accounts into cryptocurrency that can be cashed out anywhere.

It allows people with preexisting issues to still get covered at a reasonable cost. 
It removes the lifetime cap on benefits that some people were unfortunately bumping into. 
And the policies offered on exchanges are truly affordable priced. Sure they don't have all the bells and whistles, but I've seen plans that cost $80-90 per month, which makes having insurance and seeing a dr on a preventative basis achievable rather than waiting til something get really bad, getting lots of other people sick or exposed to your illness and then heading to the ER, as had been the norm for far too many people. 
Those are real benefits.

I think that by and large, the community has far too much faith in the idea that the amount of hashing power on the network serves as an adequate defense against dedicated attackers. 
Yes, matching the networks current power is certainly out of the reach of all but a few individuals on this planet, especially if you’re looking at the retail prices of the machines needed to do so. 
But, out of curiosity, I dug through as much information as I could find to estimate what the true cost of conducting such an attack could be, at a minimum, and the results were rather scary; by my calculations, the cost of enough silicon (finished ASIC’s, although not in carriers or packaging) to match the networks current hashing power came in at less that $3 million dollars. Obviously, there are other costs involved, chip packaging, circuit boards, supporting chipsets, cases, etc, but the point is that when most people see the hash rate exceeding what, 300,000 TH/s, the assumption is that it represents an insurmountable hurdle. It’s not.
This might be a difficult idea to swallow, so I will write up something more concise, with references, and post it somewhere in the next few days.

The sub $600 is subject to several caveats. 
Information reporting just means filing a 1099, it does not mean tha it's not reportable on your taxes. If you get $500 worth of bitcoins from 50 people, none of them will have to file a 1099, but that is certainly taxable income to you. Whether you get caught is a different story, but let's not lull people into thinking that if they just transact less than $500 at a time, they won't have to report anything on their taxes. 
Second, it's 1099 reporting is generally based on the total value of all the transactions with someone.  If someone pays you $500 in cash, they don't need to file a 1099. If they make 3 payments of $500 to you, then they do need to file one, reporting $1500 in payments.

Computers are perfectly capable of protecting high value secrets; people with hundreds of thousands, no, millions of dollars are perfectly secure logging into their bank accounts from their computers. The "problem" is that unlike dollars, bitcoin transfers are irreversible and highly untraceable (yes, you can watch coins go from address to address, but have no means of reliably knowing who controls a given address), meaning that it's extremely unforgiving to people who aren't up to snuff with their security.
People holding their coins themselves face the problem of trojans, virii al trying to get to their wallet.
People storing their bitcoins elsewhere (exchange, online wallet) face the same problem with malware trying to obtain their credentials, plus hackers trying to get into the exchange plus lack of accountability from many of the exchanges themselves.
At the end of the day - if someone were to login to your bank account and try to effect a transfer, first line of security would be the bank itself noting irregular activity. That doesn't exist with a wallet - if someone comes into possession of a private key, there's no other lines of defense after that.
And even if the bank let a transfer go through, the receiving bank would have identification of the owner of the account that those funds were transferred to - again, nothing exists like that for bitcoin.
And lastly, banks can reverse certain activity, and failing that, through court process, can force the recipient of funds to return those funds to the owner. Again, can't happen with bitcoin.
What's that all mean?
To me, it means that unless someone is confident in their ability to secure their bitcoins, it may not be appropriate for them as of yet. Secure can me a lot of things - keeping computer free of malware, learning to create offline / paper wallets, and so forth. But average joe user, whose email account and Facebook is regularly hacked causing deluges of spam and unwanted status updates, the likelihood that they'll keep their coins secure is pretty low, I think.
(that even extends to countless bitcoin and alt coin aficionados.... how many people blindly load the latest wallet for their new favorite alt coin on their computer? I don't mean to put ideas in peoples heads, but it certainly wouldn't be hard for a less than well meaning developer to add code to their installer to search the computers file system and send all files named wallet.dat to that developer).
To OP: It's good that you're questioning your ability to securely hold coins prior to obtaining them. All is not lost, though. Hardware wallets are one choice (again, you have to trust the manufacturer of the wallet, though). Even better is if you have access to a secondary computer to hold your bitcoins, on which you'll never connect to the internet. Lots of steps in between. But for certain, you want to devise a way to hold those coins yourself rather than leave them in the hands of a third party....

I suppose I'm a statist by your definition. And I can't claim to be an ardent supporter of bitcoin, i just think its an interesting curiosity. But one of your statements made me have to respond to your post:




Simply put - "statists" could support a money such as bitcoin while fully believing that it will remain an eccentricity at best, never to replace the dollar. Meaning that Bitcoins constrained supply won't ever affect government or society in way like that.
But even if Bitcoin took over as the worlds currency, there's nothing about it that prevents a state from borrowing funds and engaging in deficit spending. Just as in the past when Japan and China ran huge surpluses, they didn't just want that money to sit unproductive in their vaults, so they were more than happy to loan funds to us at interest. Same would happen if bitcoin took over the world - some people and countries would live below their means, and others would live beyond them. It would be on the ones who lived below their means to decide what rate of interest was enough to compensate them for loaning money to the others. Nothing about Bitcoin prevents that.

AGREED. Too many people around here look at the transaction fee they pay and think that's all it costs to keep the network running; the fact is that transaction fees at this point are minuscule - miners don't mine for the fees, they mine for the 25 BTC block rewards. Take away those awards and the fees would go up astronomically. Bitcoin would be crippled if that somehow occurred. It won't though, the block award is baked into the protocol. It'll be interesting to see what happens to the price of BTC at the next halving, though...

Chargebacks may suck for merchants, but they're of huge benefit to consumers. And that's the cost of doing business. If a merchant doesn't want to have to deal with the risk of the occasional charge back, then they don't have to accept credit cards. True, that means that online operations have their hands forced into accepting cards, but the fact of the matter is that, for most consumers, the only reason that they transact with a lot of websites is because of the protections embedded in the credit card system.
I've bought electronics and such from some pretty shoddy looking Chinese websites, for instance, knowing that if the site was a scam, then I wouldn't be out any dough, I could just file a complaint that I never received my merchandise. It's probably because of consumer protections like that that a huge amount of commerce takes place. Yes, big names, Amazon, Target, etc, customers don't worry about. But with Bitcoin, will you feel nearly as comfortable placing an order with a company you just stumbled upon through a Google search? I know I won't.

You can leave your order in and accept the bitcoins at the price they give you when the funds clear, or you can cancel and place a new order in a few days is the price is to your liking then. Of course you might be put off a few more days when you try to order then. Your call!

For its advantages, Bitcoin can't claim speed.... cheaper, yes. But a friend can paypal me money and i can go to the ATM and withdraw it moments later, or buy a coffee using a PP debit card. Bitcoin does not possess that speed yet, and probably won't ever, with its 10 minute block times and all. 
Doesn't decrease its utility in other places, but it's definitely not the fastest payment system out there.
You're right though - bitcoin is absolutely more censorship resistant than PP or anything else; a look at the wikileaks embargo verifies that.
With bandwidth and storage increasing, raising the cap on the block size shouldn't impede future utility, I wouldn't think. The blockchain of the future is going to be incredibly unwieldy, whether its composed of 1MB blocks or 10MB blocks. But if those 10MB blocks are chalk full of transactions, that means that the network would have undergone a HUGE increase in throughput....

OK, the genesis block can't be spent, so take out 50 BTC from they total number of bitcoins out there.
Dread Pirate's bitcoins? It's way too early to think they're gone forever. I think i recall reading that the FBI was planning to liquidate them, in which case they would be returned to the market.
Coins that haven't moved since an arbitrary date? Who knows the reason or motivation. You can't count them out just because the owner has resisted the temptation to cash them in. 
Take Satoshi's coins for instance. They haven't been traded. "Satoshi" apparently posted on p2pfoundation's page recently - so he's alive and well. Did he lose the private keys for all the coins he mined? Is he independently wealthy and therefore in no need of cashing out? Or does he desperately want to cash out but fears people discovering who he is if he does so? You can't know. But you can't be certain that he won't move them in the future.
Just as with coins from 2012 and later - are the keys lost? Or are they printed on paper wallets and locked away in a safe somewhere? You can't tell.
Yes, its certain that the total number of coins out there is less than the total number of coins mined. Heck, I joined a pool and pointed a few CPU's (no, not GPU's... CPU's!) at it and mined a bitcoin way back when. But then i thought "well, that was interesting" and deleted all traces of Bitcoin from the computer. Certainly that happened with many other people too. 
Certainly other coins were lost to crashed hard drives.
In the future (if it hasn't happened already) there will be password protected wallets whose owners die without sharing the password with anyone. 
And there could certainly be a lot of coins that are stored on physical Casascius Coins. Those could be in vault somewhere, or they could be actively getting spent and changing hands without ever touching the blockchain.
And an exchanges cold-wallet - say BTC-e's, since they've been around so long - the oldest coins in their cold storage could certainly fall into the time range you're looking at excluding. So long as there is never a "run on then bank", they may not ever appear to move, the coins could even be actively traded on their site, but if they use a database to track the transactions rather than actually moving coins from address to address on the block chain, you won't see movement from the addresses you're looking at.
But knowing all of that, it would be dangerous to assume that any particular coin is lost simply because it hasn't moved in some amount of time. Pretty soon, you'll exclude 90% of the mined coins, and assume that each remaining coin should be worth 10x as much, only to see coins from an address you assumed was dead get transferred. And then what do you do?
Best to use the worst (highest) case assumption of total number of coins out there, less any that have been provably destroyed, rather than assuming too low, and causing a panic when old coins start moving around again.

When US dollars get devalued, they're dvalued across the board. Certain holders aren't rendered immune as you seem to think. And it not an an arbitrary decision made by the wealthiest. It's called budgets. 
The U.S. government publishes figures out its budget each year. Full of spending thAt republicans want And that democrats want. Once it's agreed that's what we're spending it's fixed. Taxes are collected. Too the extent that they don't cover everything, bonds are sold. To the extent that there isn't interest in those bonds from external sources, the fed buys them. That's when the money gets created. And there are many steps to get there, none of which involve the richest. Because, as i pointed out, devaluation hits dollar holders across the board. Inflation is especially bad for long term bonds, something that is held by rich people either directly or through their asset managers. 
I like lots about Bitcoin, but i often wish thAt other bitcoiners new how the system they claim to hate so much actually works..:

The reason it's been such a non-issue in practice is because probably
Greater than 99.9% of transactions are conducted online rather than in a retail environment. And it's essentially impossible to doublespend an online purchases- you order something from Overstock and then succesfully respend those coins, overstock will see that your transaction didn't confirm and not ship your order. 
Once Bitcoin has more of a presence in retail environments, I'd expect to see android apps specifically built to attempt doublespends
You'd set up your app with the address you want your coins sent to, set whether the app should attempty it's double spend automatically after X seconds or wait for user interaction. Lastly, it would need to have a relatively large list of Bitcoin nodes loaded regularly. 
User would go to the tiger direct store, make a purchase and broadcast it to a single node with a 0.0005 transaction fee. Tigerdirects computer notes an unconfirmed transaction to the address they supplied you with and says you're good. A second later you press the doublespend button, and your phone broadcasts a new transaction to 160 nodes, spending the same exact coins you sent to tigerdirect to the second address which is under your control, along with a 0.1 btc transaction fee (just to be extreme)
Nothkngs ever 100%, but you'd have two potential end results. Either you receive the product you purchased and the bitcoins you used have successfully been transferred to tiger direct OR you leave the store with your $500 product, and the mining pools opt to include the transaction you sent to yourself, on account of the vastly larger transaction fee you included. You leave the store with your $500 product and have only spend $37.00 for it. 
Unless someone cares to explain why this wouldn't work, I'll go ahead believing that the lack of successful doublespends is not due to the impossibility of conducting one, it's due to the dearth of opportunities to actually pull one off. Once more retailers start accepting Bitcoin at the register, someone will certainly build a tool like the one I explained or figure out a better approach.
That's how I see things at least.

just like you don't have to tax on unrealized gains on stocks. But say you want to actually appreciate some of those gains, buying stuff that you've been desiring. Unless you just plan on dying one day with a ton of unspent Bitcoins and other coins, you'll have to convert or trade (which the IRS will look at as a conversion and then subsequent purchase). On the plus side, if you've got a lot of bitcoin, and you've had it over a year, the tax you'd pay would be around a third of what someone else who labored for that same amount of money would pay.

one-off pushes to get bitcoin holders to buy from Overstock and/or other retailers aren't going to raise many eyebrows.... Instead, whats needed is constant spending (one day of, just to throw out a number, $5 million in BTC demented sales, versus a quarter of $50,000 sales per day, the second will generate a lot more interest by the other etailers in the world, even if the total comes up a little short).

Are you reall asking that? What will cause or stop that from occurring is if the miners (the ones actually providing the hashing power) were more conscientious / concerned about who benefits from their hashing power. 
This is an issue for the miners to solve, if Ghash attempts to turn away hashing power now, then it will just be another pool that ends u in their place in the future. And when that happens, I also won't be the fault of the pool operator, but if the miners who and their hashing power to that pool.

It's not a question of whether it's able to be invented. It's a question of whether operator wish do to do so. 
But more, it's that users give them the opportunity in the first place. Stop blaming exchanges when users are leaving their coins there and treating them like banks or wallets. The entire premise of bitcoin obviates the need for banks or anyone else to hold your money for you. People that leave their money in the hands of others are just giving those people the opportunity to err.
So, sure, yell at the exchanges if you'd like. But we really need to be educating users - teaching them or showing them that there is no reason to leave their coins at an exchange. If you don't trust banks and you don't trust the Federal Reserve, why would you trust a Bitcoin exchange? I's the same thing. Except fiat currencies depend on banks and the Fed, while for Bitcoin, the roll of an exchange should be limited strictly to converting one currency to another and then returning the converted currency back to your own wallet.

Absolutely. That's why i said (and maybe I didn't place enough emphasis on) that the business model needs to involve a brick and mortar business in the receiving country, that receives and converts the bitcoins for the customer. 
Basically, for using bitcoin as the intermediate part of the transaction, the recipient absolutely doesn't need to be aware of bitcoins role in the process, and the sender doesn't even need to be aware, necessarily. For all they know, a new transfer business could have just opened that promises much lower fees than they're used to paying and leave bitcoin in the small print. Or they could be made aware of bitcoins role, even to the extent that the transfer business could provide senders with a wallet address for their loved ones.
Either way, properly worked out, it seems like it would be a cinch to approach the banking systems in countries with high levels of remittance activity and say "we want to do business here with bitcoin, and this is why it will be of benefit to you". A hand in hand approach rather than a "down with the existing order!" approach.

I'm not saying that he shouldn't get the reward, but i am saying the because of the earlier adopters' outsized holdings, the risk to everyone (including other early adopters) is that if any one of them rushes for the exit, it can have a big impact; we just saw that with the bearwhale thing, and that's a scenario that could potentially happen many more times.
It's still fine for us, but the "big boys" (institutions, potentially small nations) will probably not feel comfortable being in the passenger seat and having no idea who's driving. When they're parked in dollars, at the least, the Fed tries to be graceful with their moves to not cause wild swings, and by the dispersion of the holdings, basically no one but the operators at the Fed can cause any huge sudden swings in the value of a dollar. Same with the Euro. 
Bitcoin? Not the case at all.

The entire purpose of Bitcoin, from what I recall of satoshis white paper, is that it's a decentralized, trust-less currency. Sure, the 10 minte block time makes it inconvinent for retail transactions, but thinking zero confirm transactions are acceptable introduces the need for trust in a system that's supposrd to be trustless, throwing half of satoshis invention out the window...
I get that in lots of instances people are willing to assume a certain amount of risk rather than wait for the confirmations, but that's something I would say is an actual shortcoming of Bitcoin in its current incarnation that should be brought to the developers to address rather than try to poo poo it and pretend it's not an issue at all.

A foundation is basucally a corporation that's deemed to be operating in the publics interest. Directors and officers typically need to be listed with the state its formed in, but that's just a form where you write in a mane and that's it. States don't ask for proof of each persons identity. You could theoretically write in any name you want, they won't be any wiser to it, though you could get charged with forgery or something.
That's just for officers and directors. Founder isn't a legal term at all, strictly honorary. There's no filing requirements for listing founders.
A foundation in the form of a trust doesn't even file that much. Trustees, a board of advisors (if it has one ), none of that is filed anywhere.
The application for a 501c3 exemption might ask for identifying info for the organizations officers, directors , trustees, (I dint recall, it's been a while since I prepared one), but that just gets filed away at the irs it's nowhere accessible to the public. Even if it was though, founder is something thT gets reported.

This. 
Every conversation about bitcoin being used in retail transactions, I point out that unfortunately, depending on how the network is going that day, someone could be 8 minutes down the road or even an hour away when the recipient realizes they've been had.  To this people always Chime in that for low value transactions, zero confirms are safe. 
That's not how it works. Either a transaction is accepted by the network and included in the block chain or it's not. The entire point of bitcoin was to enable commerce between two people who don't trust one another by letting them rely on the block chain instead. When people say  "zero confirm transactions are safe" they're ignoring the entire purpose of bitcoin. 
To me the solution is incredibly simple - a much faster block time. Make it a minute or two minutes, just so thAt a recipient can see in a timely manner that at least a pool or two are calling the transaction valid rather than have to rely on "trust" when the entire system was built to avoid needing to trust one another.

You were well aware of the fees (or should have been, it's easy enough to look up the expected fees of an item selling at a certain price) prior to listing your auction. 
And, I have to say, I agree with the buyer. If i'm buying something used off of someone on eBay, I want recourse in case its not as described. The buyer messaging me asking me if I'd go and buy bitcoins to pay them with would set off huge redflags in my mind. 
If you want to sell your stuff for bitcoin, there are services that allow you to just that, or even use bitcointalk's message board. At the same time, there are trusted escrowers to be found on that site, something your request to the buyer didn't cover.
And besides, even if the buyer had paid you in bitcoin, you're still on the hook for the eBay fees, like it or not. So all you're really out is $45 for payment processing, which, again, was disclosed to you in the first place. Unless you were planning on not paying them their fee if you could circumvent their payment system?
I do understand the frustration of having to wait to withdraw your paypal, buet at the same time, it's a protection they've found they need to have. Allow instant withdrawals, and I'm sure the result was people selling large, bogus items on eBay, having funds sent to their paypal account, transferring those funds elsewhere and cash out...  How they counter that is, the first time you make a big sale, they hold your money for 3 weeks OR until the buyer posts positive feedback about the sale.
None of this seems too complicated.

Yes, instead of being ravaged by 3 or 4% annual inflation from a fiat currency (heck, even 10 or 20% annual inflation in some extreme scenario besides Zimbabwe) you could instead park your long term savings in the stable Bitcoin, which, while it has gone up since it's inception, has suffered wild swings more recently. If you started "saving" when BTC was $1100, you'd need an awful long time to come out ahead vs inflation.
Rather than taking advice from OP, I'd encourage anyone new to Bitcoin reading this thread to take their advice from Gavin Andresen, bitcoin's former lead developer and the Bitcoin Foundations current chief scientist, who said (in June):

Right. You deposit $100. That's what the bank owes you. They then loan out $95, doing so doesn't change what the bank owes you. It just recognizes that most money that's on deposit is there for a longer duration - keep 5% available on hand! which should be way more than sufficient for handling day to day withdrawals, and the rest of the money is out to work, leant out in the form of personal and business loans, mortgages, overdraft lines of credit, etc.

Customer deposits are invested in a variety of instruments. Cash reserve, T-bills, Government bonds, Mortgages, etc - all are loans. A banks business is LENDING first and foremost. Where do they get the money to lend? Customer deposits. Why do customers put money with them? Typically, for interest. But nowadays, its not the zero percent interest rates that have people depositing money, but thanks to the world going electronic, everyone wants payment by ACH, direct debit, debit card, etc.
so no, it should not be forced to liquidate all accounts for a day each year in order to "prove" liquidity. A thorough audit, going through their investments line by line and establishing that the proceeds from their sale would cover deposits ought to be good enough.

I think he does get it to an extent
There are two basic uses for bitcoin - as a means of transmitting money, or as a speculative asset in its own right. 
With all the comparisons to Western Union, credit cards, Paypal and the like, bitcoin is certainly a presence in the money transmission world, and it would take very little additional work to create a bitcoin version of western union. 
Compared to western union or a bank wire transfer, I think that bitcoin wins, hands down. If it's just used as a means of transmission, it's value means very little - one bitcoin could be worth $10,000 or $10, whatever price bitcoin eventually stabilizes at, it's utility will be identical. He understands that when he alludes to the value of a checkbook. 
The other reason people are buying bitcoins is for the speculative aspect, I think that's where he's advising people against holding it. Which is basically the same stance he has for gold, which many in the bitcoin community compare bitcoins to.  His point on gold is, you pay money to dig it up, melt it down,and end up with a gold coin (or bar), and that gold coin is all you will ever have. It doesn't produce money on its own or grow into more gold bars later on, just as having a bitcoin in your wallet provides no benefit on its own - that one bitcoin will always be one bitcoin. To make more, you have to hold onto it and hope that someone else will pay you more for it later on. 
So, I think that his statement shows that he does understand the utility of bitcoin (transferring funds to someone that you trust or would otherwise never expect to be able to contest or reclaim those money's). But as a buy and hold type of investment, it's clear he views it as a commodity just like gold, oil, or timber, none of which has he advocated the average investor to buy up.

Stores don't make anything from gift cards, but they do generate guaranteed future sales. Store X could sell prepaid Visa cards and just pocket whatever commission Visa gives them for the transaction, or they could sell gift cards only usable at their store, and therefore guarantee that the recipient of the card will spend their gift at their store.
A retailer who offers gift cards would be crazy to stop selling them. Maybe only sell them for cash would be the answer, but really and unfortunately, rather than nitpicking on this one avenue for loss, ownership and management should just accept that they're going to suffer theft losses one way or the other and build that into their pricing. That's how it works.

How does proving solvency work , exactly? 
The site shows off addresses with X account of coins in them. Take me for example - "lucas exchange" wants to prove its solvency, so I post links to the public key if my wallets, and move those coins to new predefined wallets so that every one can be satisfied that I have control over 1,200,000 bitcoins. 
Have I proved solvency? No. You don't know what my customer balances   Are. If I owe my customers 900,000 bitcoins, then yes I have demonstrated solvency. But if I owe my customers 1,300,000 bitcoins I've just demonstrated that I'm insolvent. How would you know what my customers bitcoin balances actually are?
Even if I report that I owe my customers  900,000 BTC, how would you know that that's what i owe, or if I gave you that number just to make myself look solvent?
TLDR: proving solvency can't be done just by showing how many bitcoins one has. Not even if I tell you how much I owe my customers. The only way to prove solvency is  by having an independent auditor review the exchanges books and records.
And you better be sure the audit is done by  someone competent and experienced. Any one can say "I audited it and it looks fine to me" while simultaneously taking a bribe to underreport the exchanges debts. 
In short ; proof of solvency means absolutetly nothing v
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:40:24
There's still an issue of control. If someone can sign a message, they can send those coins out. Yes, I know the same thing can happen with cash and checks, but companies typically don't hold onto much raw cash, just some starting cash for use as change. And people can write checks fraudlently, but its very easy to trace traditional money through the system, and to recall it, freeze accounts, etc. Bitcoin presents new problems. Yes, it provides new opportunities.
I just know one of my employers undergoes an audit every year... its a foundation, pretty intensive audit, and the auditors are extremely uncomfortable with many of its hedge fund investments...  they just have to rely on those funds' own audited financials. I can't imagine how comfortable they'ed be with us holding bitcoin...

That makes no sense.
Are you saying that if my eBay credentials get stolen and a thief buys bitcoins and has those coins delivered to their address, when i complain to eBay, they're going to say "oh sorry, you bought digital goods, you don't have buyer protection anymore"?
You could say "but its fraud, so its different". But who is the onus on to "prove" what occurred? How do i prove that my eBay account was used to buy a digital something without my permission? How do i prove that i never received the bitcoins the buyer says he sold to me (but actually went to a hacker)?

What are you talking about? They are two distinctly different things. Bitcoin is akin to cash, which is great if you have it. Unfortunately, lots of people don't have enough can, and therefore,need to borrow, hence credit cards. 
Too many people sem to think that if bitcoin ruled the world, so many current systems would come to an end. They won't, they'll just be denominated in bitcoin is all. Could be credit card debt, could be the national debt. People with more btc than their needs require will always be on the lookout to "put that money to work" just as happens with people with excess cash.

What exactly is the "agenda" that you think that 2bit is pushing, and how does he benefit?
I know the community generally scoffs at criticisms by journalists who aren't wry well informed,using the fact that theryre not well informed at the reason to dispell their comments. So, I can see why someone pointing out flaws or shortcoming with the system who can't be shooed awY as easily isn't desirable, but is you asking him to simmer down his comments sounds like "well, I can't shoot the messenger here, could you just quiet down please?"
The world needs unbiased views of both bitcoins promises and it's failure, so that people can be fully informed as the do their own due diligence.  
As for your statement "the only threat to bitcoin would be if it had a flaw in the protocol", that's commonly stated, and, I think, grossly misleading. Yes, the biggest threat to bitcoin would be if there was a flaw in the protocol, because if money could spent and respent, it would have no value. But contrary, we are seeing time and time again, that the biggest threat to users isn't that the protocol is flawed, but that it's not. 
That causes people to be hit with immediate, irretrievable loses. And, if even Erik vorhees can lose substantial amounts of coins due to the fox implosion, then clearly the hundreds of thousands of people not as well informed as him are at even greater risk. 
Ill just close saying that everyone is allowed their opinion, for and against. If his arguments and reasoning are false, by all means say so. But if you just don like his message, asking him to quiet down seems inappropriate. And until people learn that while the biggest threat to bitcoin itself is the discovery of a flaw within it, it's the fact that so far it works exactly as promised that is the biggest threat to users, who need to know that they're about to step foot into a Darwinian ecosystem.

First off the entire basis for your argument, senator Coburns anticipated reply just fell apart, as he apprarently agrees with Mr. Hess.
Secondly, journalists are not automaton's, they are allowed to have opinions, even (shock!) opinions that aren't shared by their readership; If you disagree (which you're allowed to do), you're entitled,  but demanding that they be "finished" or that his journalism is somehow "corrupt", it just strikes me as absurd.

It's the miners that contribute to their pool who are acting irrationally. Gnash is right, if it's not them it'll just be someone else, unless miners themselves take responsibility and move their hashing power to other pools to prevent situations like this from occurring.

That's been an "issue" with bitcoin since day one. It's benefits fall squarely on the merchant (lower transaction fees, no charge backs, etc), where as customers actually end up disadvantaged in the situation (no reward points, no ability to chargeback).
I don't know how appropriate it is, though, to plea for merchants to adopt bitcoin, and then, once they do and find that the customers aren't there, at least not in the quantities they'ed hoped,  to then say to them "thanks for accepting bitcoin - now can you offer us a discount if we pay with it?"

Coinbase, I think, said that 96%+ of the funds that they hold are in cold storage, meaning that they can operate and service their customers while only having a small percentage of their Bitcoins online at any given time. 
It won't take a big leap to see an exchange take on the roll of being a bank and move to a fractional reserve style of operations. Offer customers interest on their deposits, and make short and medium term loans with some of those moneys. That'd all have to be clearly disclosed... but at the end of the day, that'd do wonders for the Bitcoin denominated economy.

One could argue, and this is a big unknown, that the block reward plus the transaction fees are what miners need to make in order to to make mining worth while. True, the spender in the transaction does not (currently)  contribute to the block reward, they only add transaction fees which are neglibibe compared to the block reward. As the block reward continues to dwindle, there is going to need to be a significant increase in tx fees paid per transction, or else... well, we don't know what the outcome would be.
But the point is,just because spenders don't pay the block reward, that reward is the main reason that miners mine.

I think you're getting it wrong; I'm not in any way alluding to a shortage of coins due to these concentrations of holdings. 
More, the potential worry is for the potential of many more "bearwhale" incidences; there are 70 people with 10k+ BTC; and another 930 with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC. So, holders of bitcoin need to be aware that if any of these other holders make a sudden move, it will cause a huge impact to them, just as we saw happen in the last week.
 
This applies to individual investors, just an added thing to think about. Institutional investors (true institutions, with investment committees and such - endowments, pensions, hedge funds), I'd expect that this would all come up during the course of their due diligence.
As for the impact of this against the potential for a nation adopting BTC as their official currency, again, bear whale type fears - 99,000 people (the current "top 10%") own 90% of the bitcoins currently in existence, what nation would want to base the ability to meet their budgets' obligations, let alone worry about the effects that wild swings could have on the budgets of their citizens.
Nation X starts the year with 800,000 BTC, valued at $1,000 apiece. They have 400k BTC of domestic spending to do (no problem there, its all BTC denominated), and $400mln of expenditures needed to be made to foreign companies or countries. Then, a few of bitcoins top 1% come along and pull bear whale maneuvers, not being malicious, just being anxious and wanting to convert their coins to cash NOW, and Bitcoin falls to $500; now the country can't meet their budgetary obligations.
Yes, they're exposed to the actions of others no matter what currency choice they make, any other currencies holdings are spread among multitudes more people. No one person can cause that significant and that rapid of a swing in any other currency. But in Bitcoin, yes they can, because such a few number of people own such a huge percentage of it.
Hope that makes my side clear?

I don't see anything you listed as being real game changers. 
Money movements. 
At the low end, the remittances market, the loss of transaction fees woukd equate to a bit of a raise. If the standard fee is 10% and each worker sends half their pay home, thAt equates to a 5% raise. Nice but not at all game changing. 
At gnd high end, large wire transfers. For one; the wire transfer fee is quiye small when you're wiring $10,000 or more. Maybe it's $30 flat. Not to say the fee changes based on gbe amount sent, it doesn't. But as the wires get bigger and bigger the fee becomes less and less noticeable. 
Crypto stocks. Nothing new here. Company's can and do issue stock all the time. They let their shares be traded on exchanges or they issue shares directly. Dividend payments are a breeze already. The bigger issue are shareholder meetings, shareholder votes, getting materials to share holders, and making sure everything is filed with the SEC ontime. I'm of the view that tnd SEC is an important entity that shouldn't be done away with. So, given all that, how does bitcoit benefit or even change the current situation?

First, they need to acknowledge that what they did here, ambush journlism, is wrong and is mire befitting a daily rag, that a national publication, and apologize to the guy that was directly impacted. Then, they can vow to us , their real or potential readership, that such an approach was wrong and won't be taken again. 
Going straight to advertisers in this case, conveys none of that. What can you say "I'm not going to buy your products anymore, because the recipient of one line item if your ad budget acted irresponsibly and there's no indication that they'll even do it again?"  
I think most advertisers would think that's a stretch. Besides, advertisers Arebt exactly champions of privacy. Probably tbe biggest collector of information on private individuals is google, tbs worlds biggest ad agency. And  9/10 of all the other data collected about us is done at the behest of other advertisers, all in the name of more targeted ads. 
My suggestion still is to take it to the source. Maybe the bitcoin community of reddit isn't the place to start lookihg for that support, I'll concede that. But I bet that a lot of Newsweek subscribers would be disappointed or disgusted by that publication if they used those same tactics in trying to land an Interview with countless other people of public interest.

I was going to say something along the lines of "you watched Buffett speak for 30 or 40 minutes, and that's what you walked away with? But whoever posted that clip did their darnedest to paint Buffett 
You have to recall the time and setting.  This was the late 90's, bubble going full steam ahead. New dot comes we're rolled out throu IPO's nonstop, and the public and even a large swathe of the professionals were all buying into this mantra that previous metrics used for value companies (things like sales, earnings, margins) were of a bygone era, that what really mattered was "eyeballs". 
Obviously, that era didn't end well for the people who must thoroughly bought into that hoopla, but what tons and tins of people misunderstand about Buffett during that era is that while he avoided making investments in dotcoms,his returns beat out the Nasdaq's for most of the 90's - it was only in 2000 when techs had their final blowout year before imploding that an investor would have come out ahead buying the tech bucket rather than sticking with Berkshire. 
So, yes, he said those words. But the times then were far different than they are today. It wasn't a blanket "internet companies have no value, and never will" but rather it's impossible (and dangerous) to try to determine proper valuations for those companies (say, huge market cap, little revenue, lots of red ink, and vague promises of growth and eyeballs). 
But explaining that in even as little detail as I provided is no good when a 44 second clip with no outside context serves to further the "warren Buffett hates tech so his opinion on bitcoin has no bearing" agenda. 
Like him or not, agree with him or not, he is full of investing wisdoms that nearly all of us could benefit from. But chopping up his words or just finding the briefest of sound bites doesn't benefit you, me, or anyone else coming to this sub hoping to learn more about this new phenomenon.

When one asks why bitcoin should have any value at all, the most common reply is "the blockchain, which provides an indisputable log of all the transactions which have ever taken place on the network". The one caveat is that transactions which appear on the blockchain are those that have received confirmations.
I'm appalled at how many people poo-poo the importance of confirmations. Independently confirmed transactions are the entire basis for Satoshi's invention. 
Sure, in this instance, Blockchain can take steps to see that this exploit will no longer work, but this wasn't their issue per se. The real issue is the insistence by members of the economy to transact without waiting to see that the transactions that make up the balance they see on their screens have been confirmed. Issues will continue to arise, and everyone will go on the defense, saying "it isn't the bitcoin network that's at fault, its _____s faulty _____"
No, the issue is the operator's insistence on accepting confirmations with no confirmations. If 7 to 10 minutes is too long to wait (which it clearly is, otherwise, there wouldn't be a "need" to transact without confirmations), then the real world needs to let the developers know that so that they can discuss solutions moving forward, including, hopefully!, a reduction in the time between the issuance of new blocks...

None of this makes sense.
Your clients BTC weren't being held as BTC? Why else would you have had to convert your exchanges fiat holdings to BTC during the course of your audit?
What service were you using to create your holding wallet? Brainwallet? How would a hacker have intercepted your private key otherwise?
And you were opposed to proving your solvency? That you had to have your arm twisted by your "investors" in order to prove such, only to have "lost" the bitcoin during the course of such, seems off. More likely you didn't have the coin in the first place.
Exchanges, wallets, indeed, ANYONE holding bitcoins on account of others, NEED to undergo FULL AUDITS. Not just "proof of solvency", but full audits of their bitcoins, their dollars, and any other fiat currency they handle.
Anything less is insufficient, and until the community demands this, such events will continue to occur over and over and over again...

If you're not going to wait for confirmations, then you're basically extending credit to the other party, providing them the good or service on the hope that they don't force through a new transaction on the network  (say, their their own wallet) with a higher fee.
I dislike it when people say "you don't need confirmations", as that's the antithesis of the point of the public blockchain. And it's attempting to gloss over a shortcoming of Bitcoin (the 10 minute block time) rather than say, pushing for a change to that parameter, which could do away with having to push for trust in a trustless system.

I don't know. I think of bitcoin as a beta product. It'll be around, sure, but I feel like it'll get subplantd eventually. Maybe by something that's not a pure crypto currency - rather something more forgiving to the unadept. People will cry foul, that reversible transactions destroy the whole premise of bitcoin, but I think the world wants an e-currency, and periodically gets convinced by right wingers that it should lose faith in paper money, so there's an interest in a currency not backed by a government. But, soon (in normal time, not Internet time, say 3-5 years) people will realize that they're not capable of handling crypto currencies safely, either being attacked by hackers directly or seeing huge thefts occurring at onlin wallet services. So, they'll be attracted to an government less currency that somehow (I don't know how) can provide protection from theft. Because were well past the Darwinian stage of our evolution, and while it sounds good in theory, people will flee they currency once they realize e implications of a currency that lacks protections, training wheels and all the other things we've taken for granted in the last 80 or so years.

By that logic, no price of any share of stock should move either. After all for every buyer there's a seller, and for every seller there's a buyer.
it' about demand. 
Lets say market price is $380, as that's the amount of the last trade.
There's only 5 people each willing to buy a bitcoin each for that price though.  There are 80 other people who have placed limit orders, effectively saying "I want bitcoin, but not at $380 per. I'll pay $350 each". So, if a seller came along and wanted to sell 10 bitcoins no matter what, they would first sell to the buyers willing to pay $380. Then they'ed sell 5 more to the buyers willing to pay $350. The market price (price of the last trade) would then be $350.
Understand yet?

My only point was that whoever Satoshi is, they haven't spent those coins, so no one should argue that "so and so can't be satoshi, because satoshi's a billionaire".
Originally, I thought that there was a good chance that Dorian was Satoshi, to be honest. I thought it could be plausible that he just went by his middle and last name when writing his original paper and posts, not realizing what the creature that he was giving birth to would become. It would be akin to Ross Ulbricht's early errors that lead the FBI to him years later.
But the more I hear and learn, from statements from Dorian, his brother and analysis like yours, it's becoming clearer and clearer that he's not THE satoshi Newsweek thought him to be. I still do disagree on the level of "harm" that's caused him, but that's not anything you're mentioning in your post, so I'll leave it at that.

The problem is, that more and more crooks and hackers will be focusing on finding and exploiting bugs in bitcoin exchanges, wallets, the computers running them, and any other possible way of gaining access to bitcoins that aren't theirs. 
Forget infecting computers with spambots - why devote the time and energy to get people to spam one another in the hope that they visit a phishing site?
Forget bank phishing sites - why harvest credentials for banks, and why sell and buy them, when that money and so many things purchased with that information is ultimately traceable? 
No - criminal hackers (yes, I know that hacker by definition isn't a negative word), thieves, and scammers and everyone else in that mentality will be drawn to bitcoin like a moth to porch light. Not because of any flaws in Bitcoin, but because it works exactly as promised, exactly as developed.
But big collections of Bitcoin will be targets for all sorts of criminals, rogue employees, dishonest friends, and anyone else that senses a quick buck, as they can generally be absconded with impunity, anonymously.
So, what happens to Bitfloor, Trade Fortress, MtGox and Silkroad yesterday and today, can and likely will happen to every other service that congregates lots of peoples money. Because the thing with security is the person protecting the bitcoins has to be diligent every single second, whereas the attacker only has to get through once out of unlimited tries.
Don't get me wrong - bitcoin is a fantastic piece of technology, and holds great promise. But my fear is that the bad players will continue to exploit its features and continue to cause harm to the honest people, who all lack any form of recourse and protections that they are used to having in the world of fiat currency, and even owning gold coins/bars, etc.

I agree full heartedly, but with a caveat or two it three...
Like, with the MtGox disappearance, I was genuinely shocked at how many people were using gox as a wallet. I have a coinbase account, but as soon as my coins arrive, I sweep them outb 
The problem here is that Joe Public is not able to keep their machine in such a state that they could reasonably expect their coins to not be stolen. Look at all the spam each of us recieves - this all comes from compromised computers And accounts, any if those people who stored their wallet locally or at an exchange without TFA, their coins would be long gone. 
Some people realize that and actively use exchange wallets as their own, hoping the exchange Is more secure than they could manage. I've seen many posts in the past expressing that exact point, but unfortunately saying they were using Gox as their wallet. 
It's an issue that's more complicated than it looks at a glanced. Obviously oeiple shouldn't use exchange wallets as their own, but poor skills at personal security combined with the irreversibility of bitcoin conspire to make exchange wallets look appealing. 
I don't see a fix. And that's why im genuinely scared of bitcoin achieving greater reach - the 10's or 100's of millions of people who will undoubtedly suffer huge losses to thieves and scammers.

Kind of hard to, unfortunately. They get paid in dollars, pay their rent in dollars and buy their groceries in dollars. Sure, they could get paid in bitcoin (if their employer was open to the idea), but then they'ed need to transfer those coins to an exchange, at which point they'ed need a bank account to withdraw dollars to. Otherwise, they're forced to use localbitcoins to get dollars - i say forced because depending on their geographical location, sometimes the spreads charged by localbitcoin buyers and sellers are astronomical.

I don't think there's any law that sets out what a lawyer can accept as payment for their fees. But, since Bitcoin isn't legal tender, they are not obligated to accept it, as they would be if you wanted to pay with dollars.
I would say your best bet is to contact lawyers directly and ask if they accept Bitcoin. Of course, you'll probably hear a lot of "what?" or "i've never heard of that". But really, your choice of attorney shouldn't be governed by what payment methods they accept. Instead, find an attorney that you feel comfortable with your case, and discuss bitcoin with them and ask if they'ed accept it. Either they say yes, and you can pay with BTC's, or worst case,  they say no and you have to sell the bitcoins you'd pay to them for dollars and pay with those.

Decentralized doesnt' work here. The reason fincen is hung up on this is because both businesses could concievably let people transfer currency to one another through the banking system, using bitcoin as the intermediary. There's no way that decentralized can work around that - if you want to link into the financial system (ACH, Wires, etc), then whoever the entity is that sets up a bank account to received those transfers, they are no longer part of some abstract decentralized system, they are a readily identifiable individual or business entity, with a name, address, SSN or EIN, etc..

Big banks and credit card companies aren't going to roll over simply because you're going to cost them more in legal fees than the dispute is worth. Not how it works. First off, they have legal departments who are paid salaries - whether they're playing games on their computers or writing motions and briefs. So you're not costing them anything there.

People, IMO, need to stop putting the cart before the horse - bitcoin is a pretty cool technology, but it's not going to become super valuable simply because they wish it would. It needs services and uses beyond trading and being a "store of wealth". In the remittance market, yes, it has potential to be an absolute game changer, though... 
EDIT: Found my post!

You would still have to do that if it was a "currency". Or do you think that forex traders don't pay tax?
There was talk a few years ago about letting money market funds deviate from their strict dollar per share valuation, but one of the big worries about doing that was for all of the taxable transactions that would occur (same as bitcoin, buying a starbucks on a debit card linked to your brokerage accounts money market account would trigger gains if the money market fund you bought at 99.998 cents per share was sold for 100.193 cents per share in order for you to get your coffee - that and several other things made the regulators back off the idea and let money market funds continue to carry a $1/share valuation regardless of whether or not they deviated from that value.
Same goes for bit coin. Had the IRS called Bitcoin a currency, that would have no bearing on tax on transactions. But it would change the tax treatment and make it even more complicated. 
TL/DR: Whether the IRS calls Bitcoin a capital asset or a currency has no bearing on the tax effect it would have when transacting. If you buy Bitcoins at one price and sell them at another price, you're going to have a tax effect regardless of what type of asset it's categorized as. The only thing that would prevent that would be if Bitcoin maintained a strict value per coin, which i'm sure no one here wants.

Frivilous would be handing in your return hand written on paper napkins, unless you had a really good reason for it.
Here's an IRS example of "frivilous positions" one could take when filing their return - and noted that anyone attempting to take those positions can be fined up to $5,000 just for wasting their time.
Basically, something frivilous is just attempting to waste the IRS' time.
What I was saying was FRAUD and not frivolous (again, big difference) is your suggestion of filing a return with intentionally inaccurate numbers. No way, no how is that frivolous.
Definition of frivolous is: "not having any serious purpose or value."
A tax return with intentionally mistated numbers is a serious offense. 
You could also be hit for filing a fraudulent tax return for intentionally overstating your income and paying too much in taxes - it's not about "impeding the IRS's ability to levy taxes" it's about filing information correctly or not. And, no, its' certainly not frivolous to include every mining transaction with your return, that's what they're asking for afterall. I'm just hung up on the idea of filing a return with intentionally inaccurate numbers.

No, because there was a marked improvement as a result of this. 
I'd say the exact opposite - the reason for so many of the problems we have nowadays is because too many people have a "my way or the highway approach". Either they get things exactly as they demand or else just leave things the way they were or worse...

To me the appeal of coinbase is that you can buy bitcoins with your bank account. That and only that. And that should be the only appeal for them. These companies, ESPECIALLY the honest ones (of which coinbase is one, I hope) really ought to stop even pretending to offer wallet services. It's way too much responsibility, and they offer no benefit to users, since it's not like they're insured or anything. Then it would be simple to figure out - the honest companies wouldn't offer wallets, so the only companies that would be attempting to store users bitcoins for them would be, by default, the ones you wouldn't want holding your coins.
This has got to stop. People have to stop using exchanges as wallets. If someone can't keep their computer secure to the extent that they'ed rather store their coins in another companies wallet, then they should just admit that Bitcoin isn't for them. Because until then, either by hack, theft or fraud, these companies are going to be huge targets for hackers and criminals. Thankfully OP found the flaw this time. But next time? and the time after that? And the time after that? It's a timebomb.

The issue is, why do you think customers would return to a new Gox platform, after having been burned so badly before, and conduct enough transactions to generate enough fees to receive repayment in full?
It's daunting - if gox's shortfall is 750,000 btc, and it charges a .5% commission on each trade, it needs to have its customers trade 150,000,000 bitcoins in order to repay them, on top of the commissions it would need to generate to pay its employees, rent, and all the other things it needs to keep its doors open.
At today's bitstamp price of $577/BTC, that means it needs $86.5 billion in transaction volume to repay its customers. Does anyone think that people will give them a second chance of that magnitude? They don't, that's why they're filing bankruptcy. So long as Japans laws equivalent to the US's, a judge would likely deem it impossible for Gox or its successor to generate that much money and wipe the debt away altogether.

Not the OP here, but yes, Obamacare was far from ideal. In my mind, the ideal is a single payer system. But at the same time, it was a HUGE improvement over what was in place before that. Sure, it's only a 25% improvement rather than the 100% improvement I'd have preferred, but at the end of the day, it's still an improvement over what was the status quo. And I'm not idealist enough to say "even though its a marked improvement over what we had before, since it doesn't completely revamp the system and reach every goal I would have had for it, I refuse to support it at all"
That's why many of us support Obamacare.

I've heard of escrow, yes. Who are the trusted escrow players, though?
And I'm sorry, the system for chargeback is not principally unfair. It's recourse for a customer if their card is stolen, protection from fraudulent merchants who might otherwise take orders and not ship, and as a last ditch resort against retailers who don't honor their own return policies.  
Yes, some merchants get hit by the occasional fraudulent chargeback, just like they get hit by the occassional shoplifter. 
As for your idea that the risk of charge backs pushes the cost of business so high as to hurt the economy, I call bs. Again, I would bet real money that if studies have been done, they'll be unanimous in finding that the increase in sales from customers relying on credit cards and the the protections the providers give them absolutely dwarfs the amount of losses due to chargebacks.  Hands down.

The thing that you and lots of other people don't seem to be picking up on is that the "bitcoin as property" rule works out to be far more advantageous than having it be treated as a currency. 
Same for treating coins mined as income he moment they enter your wallet. If you were mining in 2013, you want your mined coins to hit be taxed at a low value with the subsequent appreciation being capital gains, rather than having it all be income only when you spend or convert the money. 
This all works out to your favor.

It is a high value secret, its just that even if the recipient/thief on the other side of the transaction is able to pull the funds before the bank can reverse the transfer, they'll replenish you from their own funds.

Too many people put too much emphasis on bitcoins price as the measure of its success. It can fulfill so many promises wether a full bitcoin is worth $100 or $10,000 - the price is just a sideshow. 
If we want bitcoin to be a currency that people transact in, we actually need to hope that it's days of huge swings in price (up and down) come to an end. The downs scare people and the ups encourage people to keep their coins on the sidelines rather than spending them and growing the BTC economy. And a vibrant Btc denominated economy is what will cause it to succeed, not a snapshot in time price.

I have zero interest in operating a bitxoin exchamge, unfortunately. 
But the exchanges that do exist ought to be able to provide full audits for their users. Hopefully they're undergoing them already (clearly Gox wasn't!). 
Since the gox failure, exchanges have been quick to try to establish that they have enough BTC to cover their users balances, but without showing the rest of the balance sheet, there's no way to reassure us that they are actually solvent. 
Not rocket science, and it'll be a rule that's imposed eventually (the govt requires such from nearly every other financial services company that takes possession of customer funds), so the way I see it, it's something that the exchanges can get ahead of the ball with and do voluntarily, or stay behind on and have the requirement imposed from the outside. 
"But govt regulations suck"
IF such a rule prevents another gox from happening (and I believe it would) then "oh well". These people want to hold vast amounts of other people's bitcoins, the least they can do is provide true transparency so that we know whether or not they're trully solvent.

Unfortunately, no firms are providing proofs of solvency. They're providing "proof of reserves" which are entirely inadequate for what they're portayed as being. 
Users need to demand full audits of these firms. Yes, real audits cost a lot of money, but with the amount of money that many of these exchanges are handling, that should be viewed as mandatory business expense. If they need to raise fees in order to have the cash available to pay for a full, real audit, then so be it. That's whats needed. That so many users accept something that is so far off the mark is alarming, not at all awesome.

Let the attorney clarify, but i believe the situation would be that you would owe no tax (the payor files a gift tax return, not the payee). And they can give unlimited gifts, so long as each year they don't give more than $13,000 or so to the same person - more than that necessitates a gift tax return, but even then, they have a $5 million lifetime amount of tax free gifts they can give.
If they just gave you cash, you'd be off scott-free.
If they give you an appreciated security, things get different. Your tax basis in that security is NOT the value that it had on the day you received it (unless your "gift" was actually an inheritance, i.e., the person died and that's how you received it). Instead, you get the previous owners tax basis. So, if their basis was $1,000 and it was worth $4,000, you would need to pay capital gain tax on the $3,000 gain when you sold it.
If it was a truly anonymous gift and you didn't know what the basis was, you'd probably be stuck with having to assign it $0 basis, meaning the whole thing would be a capital gain when you sold it.
IF you go ahead and tip that gift you received to another total stranger, you still have no tax obligation (unless you'd already given them $9 or $10,000 that year AND had used up your gift tax exemption). They would then get your tax basis, and so forth and so on.

they'll notice when the money hits your bank account, or you make purchases that aren't inline with the income you'd previously been reporting.
For instance, if you've been making $30,000 per year for the last 10 years, then dump your bit coins and invest in a bunch of stocks, and begin reporting $20,000 per year of dividend income, the IRS will see that, extrapolate that you'd likely need $800,000 to $1,000,000 to make that much in dividends, and see that in the last 5 years, you'd reported earning $150,000.

I would say that a blockchain capable of 20MB blocks that's been deserted due to off chain transactions is a far more optimal solution than a chain only capable of 1MB blocks that's constantly trying to catch up with a growing cache of pending transactions. 
But ultimately, if the blockchain is too clunky, if people are searching out means to transact off chain in order to retain protections they had with other financial instruments, then ultimately there is no case for Bitcoin. 
I don't see why the blockchain shouldn't be used to purchase a coffee. And, as far as I can see, the only way for off chain spending to work is if both your coins are held by an intermediary AND the merchant you're spending with has an account/uses that same intermediary. Which creates a huge centralization situation, another thing Bitcoin tries to avoid. 
Really, everything you envision and describe is at odds with what Bitcoin is and what we envision it to be. Reversibility. Relying on others to store our money. Merchants using service providers to capture payments and therefore having to pay fees. Higher transactional costs to push transactions off the blockchain. And using censorship to determine which transactions are worthy of being included in the block chain. 
This isn't the Bitcoin most of us signed up for.

Yes, I've heard forever that Gox has had problems with USD withdrawals - that's why even after getting my account opened and KYC'ed, I ended up finding a different exchange to accumulate bitcoins with. Was just wondering if this is an opening to move money to Gox and buy up some bitcoins there. But for now, even if you put dollars in, you can't even get Bitcoins back out, is that what you're saying?
And this issue - is it in the bitcoin source code, or is it specific to Mt Gox only? Because it would seem like every other alt coin exchange should be done for if it's rooted in Bitcoins source -they'ed need to wait for the developers to fix bitcoin before they could patch their own implementations, no?

Yeah, the absense of Bitcoin's name from their announcement, and the oblique references to blockchain technology really make me think they're not doing what people think they're doing. 
They could clone Bitcoin and adopt OAP on top of that, or make a blockchain specifically suited to their needs and add code to OAP to work with that. It's all opensource, no need or requirement to take the tech as provided and be forced to implement it directly, they can absolutely make changes and still announce that that's the direction they're headed in. 
I'll take you up on that offer. And even turn it into a bet. If Nasdaq (ie, through their site or through an attributed quote from one of their spokespeople, states that they are definitively using Bitcoin's blockchain, ie the same blockchain we use for effecting transactions to one another, then I'll pay you $5 in btc as well. This has to come from Nasdaq itself. If the wsj says so without referencing a source from Nasdaq, no good, for instance.

I'll be honest, I'm not too thrilled with bitcoin. But despite the flaws that I see, one of the things that jumps out at me as being HUGE is the fact that with bitcoin, you don't need banking services. There is no service, save for selling bitcoins for fiat (or vice versa) that an exchange or "bank" can offer that you can't do on your own.
So on the I hand I would push for you to get your coins out of coinbase and into your own alley. On the other hand, though, I would devote some Time to learning the basics of computer security, especially as it pertains to Bitcoin, and not take possession of your coins until you feel reasonably confident that you'll be able to hold them safely. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 06:49:19
Not surprising the first sell orders were for high prices. What is surprising, shocking, is that there were takers for those offers. 
I can offer to sell you a Bitcoin for any price id like.  I could refuse to sell for anything less than $100,000 per coin. Just because I'm offering coins for that price doesn't mean you should buy them though. And just because GBTC holders first offered shares for $38, wise buyers ought to have passed. They didn't. Which gave sellers the notion of asking for even more per share. And Bitcoiners went for it. 
No one should blame the sellers. All thus is on the buyers.

We can't look at the state of tech today when projecting into the future. Tonorrows tech will certainly dwarf what we have today. 
its like QuickTime. When it first came out, all it could do on even the most state of the art computers was a few frames per second in a postage stamp sized window. But apple developed it knowing that Moores law would carry it into the future. Same should go for Bitcoin. Let's not concern ourselves with constraining it to run on yesteryears tech.

US stocks are priced at, and bought and sold for, US Dollars. I personally don't think that nearly any currently listed company would sell their shares for bitcoin, nor would any exchange do so.
The most feasible option would be for a retail broker to accept bitcoin as a funding source; you could transfer bitcoins to your account, and then things could go one of two ways:
1) You would have to sell your BTC for USD prior to making a trade
2) You could place a "buy order" and specify that the cost of the purchase be taken out of your BTC balance rather than your USD balance; supposing the broker had a healthy and liquid BTC market under their roof, this could conceivably be a seamless step.
Any way you slice or dice it though, and even if you're able to buy yourself shares of AMD directly for bitcoin, you're going to need to know the cost of your purchase in US dollar terms for tax-reporting purposes when you eventually make your sale.

Yes but if your records are pertaining to the purchase and sale of digital currencies, using a computer through a website, the irs can reasonably argue that you're going out of your way to make it more difficult to review your return. 
It's unrelated by at my work we prepared an estate tax return for a client who passed. With it we included a photocopy of an appraisal of one of their investments. The color charts were very hard to make out, so in their first informational request, the irs asked us to obtain the appraisal electronic format (word or pdf) and send it back on CDROM. 
So no, the Irs does not just have to make do with whatever you provide. If you only kept hand written records and you get pulled for an audit, expect that you'll be the one enterin data from those records into a spreadsheet for them.

@_date: 2015-05-19 06:30:57
Nope, that's not his it works or what's happening at all. 
Right now GBTC is trading at a premium to Bitcoin. It makes sense for GBTC holders to sell and sell at these levels, which will bring GBTC to parity pretty quickly. But once Gbtc starts trading at a discount, there's no mechanism to lead GBTC's price back up higher. 
And the Swedish etn has no impact at all, except it might lessen demand dor GBTC. 
Which is all absurd. 
On one hand, you've got GBTC which holds Bitcoin but isn't redeemable or convertible for Bitcoin. On the other, you've got an exchange traded note, which is a debt based security, a derivative. While the sponsor is supposed to own a like amount of Bitcoun as "exist" within the notes they sell, the notes themselves arent actually backed by those bitcoins, they exist only as an obligation of the issuing company. 
It'd be a great idea if people would quit snapping up all these products trading on exchanges thatvhwve the term Bitcoin in them. Either buy Bitcoin or wait for COIN. 
If you take everything that Bitcoiners hate about the dollar, the fed, the financial system, and made a security of that, you'd end up with an Exchange traded note, I'm pretty sure...

No offense, but what a lousy set of ideas. Really. 
Your blockchain aware tollbooth for instance. What improvement does it offer over the current transponder system? And how do you send coins to it while you're driving at 20-40 MPH's? Do you prestock it with millions of addresses for it to constantly pole? Or do you reuse addresses, which would mean that there's a permanent record of your travels available to anyone who cares to inspect the blockchain?
Or rather than needing keys to remotes, instead you can just pay money to start your car or open your garage door? What if that address runs out of coins? And given people's disastrous records of keeping their coins secure, offering that ability to anyone who happened to abscond with your wallet. Tapping a single button on a garage door opener or remote starter seems far more convienent than pulling out your smart phone, opening your wallet, and executing a transaction. 
Your movie idea has already been executed. You can buy tickets online and just flash a barcode on your smartphone to obtain your ticket, rather than printing a pass at home. No, popcorn won't be waiting for you, but don't you want fresh popcorn rather than popcorn that was made 10 minutes in advance?
Really. This isn't innovation, and hopefully doesn't constitute an idea for any killer apps. Everything you propose has already been implemented with current payment technologies, save for that one incredible convienence of having fo send coins out of a specific address in order to cause other things to occur (garage door. Car starting, etc). 
If someone's house is set up with home automation devices to accomplish this, it would be far mind straight forwRd to simply open your "my house" app and tap the garage door icon rather than open your wallet, scroll through addresses and send from this specific address. 
And again, as mentioned in the transponder part, the blockchain is publicly accessible and viewable. Meaning, anyone could monitor these addresses, see when coins are sent out, and know that your garage door is up. Likewise, every time you pulled your car in or out of the garage works be made a permanent part of the blockchain, available to analyze and study, perhaps attempt to make future predictions of your behavior by. 
So no. None of tuts is any good.

Bitcoin has first mover advantage, yes. But once a company moves to implement bitcoin, at least, once the move to accepting it directly (rather than through bitstamp or coinbase), adding support for additional cryptos becomes trivial. It wouldn't take much to create a newly liquid market - it might start out by needing to use BTC as an intermediary (merchant accepts ABC coin, exchanges to BTC, then to dollars if that's what they need), but with that added liquidity in the ABC market, it wouldn't take long for an exchange to offer direct trading between ABC and USD or EUR.
It really isn't that insurmountable.

This makes no sense. We talk about the blockchain being great because of irreversibility, low fees, etc. you're saying that most trabsactions shouldn't end up on the blockchain unless they require irreversibility - kind if flies in the face of what Bitcoin is, doesn't it? If people want to make payments that they could have the potential to reverse, might as well use credit cards, no?
And we talk about the low fees as being a feature of Bitcoin. Never mind that each transaction is subsidized to the tune of $7 or $8 due to block awards, those awards will dissipate, leaving fees as miners primary source of income. Much more likely for them to break even or profit by being able to have more trabsactions in each block. But never mind that, you say that transactions are too cheap. With that being another primary selling point of Bitcoin, what fee level do you think is appropriate? 
I can't even say I agree with your statement that there are too many trabsactions that are on the blockchain that shouldn't be there. If everyone uses coinbase and circle wallets and they transact with people who use them as payment processors, then those trabsactions could feasibly be kept off the chain, at the price of pushing people to entrust their keys and their coins to other people and companies. Again, takes away from the point of bitcoin. 
If Bitcoin does take off, it's going to need to be able to handle far more tps' than it does now. That's a fact. Unless there are gatekeepers like you that somehow steer trabsactions away from the blockchain. 
This whole debate kind of shows a chink in the blockchains armor. Or bitcoins, more accurately. Decentralized is great, except there is no one guiding force or vision pushing it forward, every change now and in the future surely will get bogged down in the quagmire of debates from people with well meaning but different opinions. 
Satoshi is long gone, and bitcoin doesn't have a Steve jobs, a Linus Torvalds, a bill gates, a Richard Branson, Larry Ellison, George Lucas or any other individual to lay out a vision and say "this is where we're going", which, we'll have to see, but it might be unfortunate for the coin, the ecosystem, and the community.

One sec, let me give you an address for you to practice sending to... ;)
Most important thing a new user should know? That the effect of speculators is much more profound than fundamentals at this point. Meaning the price is far from stable and no one but no one knows what the true value of Bitcoin will be a month from now, let alone a year from now, let alone once it has "stabilized". Is $240 cheap or expensive? It's anyone's guess. 
In that vein, Bitcoin attracts extremists. On one hand you'll hear that bitcoin is useless/a pyramid scam/whatever else, and it's price is eventually heading to zero. On the other you'll hear people say that fiat currencies are flawed, Bitcoin is the only answer, and one day a single Bitcoin will be worth astronomical amounts. Best to filter out both types, I think.  Absent a fundamental flW, Bitcoin will never go to zero so long as there is one other person willing to offer you something for it. And the likelihood of the dollar, euro, renminbi /yuan all imploding is likely pretty close to zero as well. 
Lastly, SECURE your bitcoins!! Keeping them in an offline computer is best, but if that's not feasible, do your best to secure the computer you keep them on, or that you use for generating offline/cold storage addresses. If your coins are stolen, that's it. They're gone. No recourse. No undo. 
Similarly, if you're not in sole control of your private key, then then your coins aren't "secure". That puts you in he position of needing to trust and hope that that third party will respond to your wishes when you ask them to transact for you. And it also leaves that third party, or their employees, with the ability to walk away with your coins whenever they'ed like 
@_date: 2015-05-04 19:08:51
That's not bullish, that's idiotic, honestly. If you think BTC is going to rise in value to support such a price, then go and buy BTC, it's cheaper, hence more upside.  
Really, people ought to pay no attention to GBTC this week and certainly shouldn't buy. Wait for the excitement to die down and buy when prices are rational. It'll happen, don't worry. Because we should all know the old saying, buy low sell high. Buying high is not a recipe for making money. And it's clear the price is high, considering that each share only contains $24 worth of assets/value. No way in the world to rationalize buying 24 of assets for $38. 
No way at all.

They should be able to redeem their BIT shares directly. However, someone posted a link to correspondence to shareholders explaining that in actuality they can't directly redeem their BIT shares, they need to address some issues raised by the SEC for direct redemptions to be able to occur. I wish I bookmarked the link, and I'll post it here if I come across it again. 
So currently, the only exit strategy for BIT holders is to convert to GBTC and sell into the market. Either way, even a direct investment in BIT was subject to the 12 month lock-up, but thAts a moot point since shareholders can't redeem at all.

We can't drag oud feet looking for a solution that's appropriate both today and in 2116. A stop gap solution that will get us a decade or two out is fine; if Bitcoin takes off and a new solution needs to be created further down the road so be it. It seems insane to risk capping off network growth now in order to find a solution that will be appropriate decades from now, where we have no idea what the landscape will look like. 
But no, we should stick with 1 MB blocks, because 20Mb blocks will only be a tenth of the size that could be required a quarter century from now if Bitcoin has completely vanquished fist. Let's get a fix in place today thAt can help see the network grow for the next 5 or 10 years, and if that fix turns out to only be a stop gap solution, we'll fix it at that point.

Ms tagging the IRS into the argument will get you nowhere. The IRS hasn't decreed that Bitcoin is not currency, only that it should be taxed as an investment asset. This is what we WANT, especially hodlers. The tax rate on long term capital gains is among the most beneficial to us (it's low). But that's just for tax purposes. Bitcoin falls under the purview of FINCEN because it's a beater instrument, albeit electronic.
Ir you're walking down the street and find a dollar, you can go ahead and spend it, deposit it to your bank account, or whatever else. It's a bearer instrument. By possessing it physically; you can do whatever you like with it. Hence, it falls under FINCENs purview. Same goes for Euros and Bitcoin's. They're bearer instruments. FINCEN wouldn't care less what the IRS' tax treatment of any of those are, it's completely unrelated.  
 As for non-bearer instruments. Checks, stock certificates, etc. if you walk down the street and find a Microsoft share certificate, it's essentially worthless to you. You can't exchange it for goods or services (unless you trade it to a dummy who doesn't realize it's useless to them), nor can you deposit it to your brokerage account and sell it. If the owner goes ahead and effects a transfer, the change in possession is recorded. 
FINCEN, and other orgs that regulate money, they do so because of its "bearer" nature, not because of how the IRS taxes it. Maybe you make a big enough of a stink that the IRS takes notice. They won't tell regulators "hey, this guys right, we tax it an an investment asset, so it's not under your jurisdiction."  But maybe maybe maybe, you'll make such a convincing case for it to be a currency that the IRS will say "you know, that's right. We've been wrong. Next year we'll amend the tax code and have Bitcoin taxed as a currency instead". And then, the taxes that long term holders pay when they sell will go up quite a bit. 
Point is, the IRS is only concerned with tax collection. Decisions they make as to how different assets are taxed means nothing to other government agencies. And we don't want the IRS to change its mind on this. 
Just want to be clear on that. It doesn't help your case all. 
Instead, I'd suggest bringing to NC's attention the "Bitcoin friendly states" and point out the potential jobs losses and shrinkage of the tax base if developers and interested users decided to leave NC as a result. Supposing you could find data to back up that sort of claim, that'd be a whole lot more persuasive than citing the IRS
Additionally, the law looks like it tries to regulate Bitcoin processors rather than Bitcoin itself; to your last point, that wouldn't mean that they'd have to regulate every crypto currency and if they forgot to include one, oops. It just regulates the processors, exchanges. So if there are no payment processors for XTZ coin, there's no one to regulate. 
I don't know. I think you should concentrate on the good (making NC a tech friendly environment who attract companies, spur job growth), whereas taking an aggressive stand would mean that they don't care to attract tech jobs. 
The other angle, as it's presented right now, strikes me more ad a "no fair!" Type of approach...

The state of New York didn't, couldn't, grant a company the right to operate nationwide. They can operate in New York and do business with out of state customers who come to New York. Even then, some states' financial regulators might not permit them to accept deposits from their states citizens without being registered and approved by that state as well. And they certainly can't open branch offices in other states to conduct business - "were registered and licensed by the state of New York" won't matter at all to the financial authorities of Kentucky.

Let's suppose that finding a block is currently worth $6125 to miners, and assuming the electricity costs $5000, with the remaining "profit" being not just profit, but also a set aside to buy future hardware in order to remain competitive and maintain their proportion of the network. 
Right now, there are what 700 or 800 transactions per block on average?  If each trabsactor is paying 5 cents per transaction, transaction fees contribute $40 per block to miners income. Even if we averaged a sustained 6tps, that gives us 3600 transactions per block. At 5 cents per, they bring in a total of $180. 
For non subsidized mining to work currently, transactions would need to be around $8. Even if miners forgot about making profit or buying more equipment, then the fees would need to be around 6.25 per transaction to pay electricity. If the network could sustain 6 tps, each would have to cost $1.39 with nearly full blocks. 
As transaction volume increases, if the network/block size can accommodate it, then the minimum cost per transaction can and will decrease. 
But without the subsidy? Zero reason to assume that miners will mine blocks at fee levels that lock in losses. You could say that miners will withdraw from the network until difficulty lowers enough to warrant their return. But there are a lot of miners bought and paid for, that all have costs that need to be recouped. 
Which do you think more likely, the miners continue mining knowing full well that doing so guarantees a loss? Nearly all miners withdrawing from the network (dufficukty would have to be less than 1% if what it is currently for the electricity cost to exceed the USD reward of fee only blocks at today's levels). Know secure would the network then be, with 1% of miners mining and the other 99% sitting on idle rigs, possibly renting them out to who knows who to do who knows what with them? Or is it possible that the miners might collude and say "we're all going to go broke if this is the status quo. More than anyone else, the Bitcoin network NEEDS us. Let's agree to let it be known that transactions with fees attached of less than $X won't be processed. Ever."  
There will be whining and screaming certainly, but there is no counter, the miners hold all the cards. When mining is profitable thanks block awards, they all jostle around and prioritize transactions with fees, but once that award goes away (or the block award halves without a corresponding increase in prices). I think we'll find that very few do the work for charity. 
Point if this? There are fixed costs to mining. With a 1MB block size which accommodates at most 7Tps, mining works not because of fees but because of block awards. When those awards go away, that money will need to be made up from somewhere. 1 mb blocks mean each trabsactor needs to cobtribute something to the pie. Not much, but a huge percentage increase over where it stands today. With 20 MB blocks, assuming an increase in usage (which we all are assuming will happen), then those fees can be made lower and lower over time, as more transactions appear in each block  one day they might even approach pennies or sub-pennies. But that's only possible by increasing the capacity of the network.

Why this obsession with having one blockchain and one alone? Doesn't make sense. There are probably plenty of use cases that wouldn't require the use of Butcoins blockchain. Take it as a complement that others see value of the blockchain concept at all, but don't scoff if they don't happen to use the "one true" blockchain....
Besides, with many now pushing for transactions of the future to take place on sidechains or off chain altogether, in order to better manage the size of the blockchain, hoping/expecting that every company that has a blockchain related idea will use Bitcoin's runs the risk of inducing real strain to the system. 
Reall, I think that Bitcoin's blockchain should be devoted to Bitcoin related transactions. Calling for that isn't akin to asking every company to develop their own version of the web, but hoping they develop their own websites and store their data in their own databases.

From the Bitcoin Investment Trusts 2014 annual report:
**The Trust has suspended its redemption program, which could have a material adverse effect on an investment in the Shares.**
On April 1, 2014, the Trust launched a program pursuant to which Shareholders could request redemption subject to certain limitations. On September 23, 2014, the Distributor received a letter from the staff of the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations summarizing the staff’s findings from an onsite review of the Distributor’s broker-dealer activities conducted in June 2014. In its exit report, the staff stated that it had concluded that the Trust’s redemption program, in which Shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their Shares through the Authorized Participant, appears to violate Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act because such redemptions of Shares take place at the same time the Trust is in the process of creating Shares. The Distributor and the Trust are in discussions with the staff of the SEC in order to resolve the staff’s concerns, although the Distributor and the Trust cannot at this time predict whether the Trust will be permitted to reinstate the Share redemption program for the benefit of Shareholders or the impact such a resolution may have on their respective activities. Until such time as the Trust is able to reinitiate the Share redemption program for the benefit of Shareholders, if ever, investors will be unable to (or could be significantly impeded in attempting to) sell or otherwise liquidate their investment in the Shares, which could have a material adverse impact on an investment in the Shares.

When did people think that Bitcoin provided privacy?
It doesn't.
It doesn't use our names, true. Just unique addresses that Big Data can use to tie most of those addresses back to our true names. 
Emailed a Bitcoin address?
Have a Bitcoin address posted on your bitcointalk profile?
Collected coins from Changetip?
Bought through Coinbase or Circle?
Buying something from a merchant that uses Bitpay?
The list goes on and on... All of them are links back to either our true identities or a step away. 
Yes, if you mine your coins or acquire them in person for cash, then the coins at that address aren't linked to your Identity. Merge them with other coins, by sending more coins than any single address in your wallet contains, and you potentially draw a line connecting the unlinked coins in your wallet to the the ones that are linked to your identity...
And the thing is, nobody is perfect... Even if people have so far avoided creating any form of link between their own identities and the coins they hold, one misstep in the future can link all of your prior transactions to you. They're all in the blockchain, just waiting to be analyzed...
So, lets stop fooling ourselves and thinking that privacy is a feature of Bitcoin. It isn't, and it's dangerous to think that it is.
Doesn't excuse Coinbase for going above and beyond in providing far more data than necessary, but too many people think that Bitcoin is something that it isn't, anonymity wise...

Except, in order to be a part of thr international financial system, banks have to adhere to a lot of rules that were and are there solely at the behest of the United States government. That's whether or not the bank has US customers - if they take on US citizens as customers, then they basically have to adhere to all the rules as if they were a bank on US soil. And, believe it not, banks care about these things. Look at Credit Suisse, who was caught helping Americans keep undeclared accounts - the solution they negotiated with the US was actually illegal according to Swiss Law, but instead of being rejected due to its illegality, the Swiss rewrote portions of the bank secrecy law   Better that than find the entire country barred from accessing the international finance system.

Just as dividends are counted as income when receieved, or when reinvested.
With the price history of bitcoin especially, this is a benefit to OP.
He's got his wallet history, hopefully, so he should know how many bitcoins he received on which dates. From there, he can get historic prices to determine the value on each date that bitcoins were received. And now the good part:
I'm not going to look up specific dates and prices, just going to make them up, but say OP mined coins as follows:
1/1/2013    mined 0.15 BTC       BTC Value: $30/coin
1/8/2013    mined 0.12 BTC       BTC Value: $28/coin
1/17/2013   mined 0.11 BTC      BTC Value: $35/coin
For those three days, he'd have income of $11.71, and that's all that would be reportable for 2013. If he sold those coins today at $467/coin, that would cause $165.75 in long term capital gains). If he just had to pay tax when they were sold, he'd have 177.46 of ordinary income to report in 2014.
To use bigger numbers so you can see the difference better:
Say someone with a job that pays $50k/year mined 100 BTC during the course of the year at an average value of $100/BTC, and sold them at the end of this year for $600/BTC.
Last year, they'd have $10,000 additional income to pay tax on at ordinary rates ($2,500), and this year, they'ed have $50,000 of long term capital gains getting taxed at more advantageous rate ($7,500).
Supposing that 2014 taxes stay the same as 2013, the mining income would cause a tax hit of around $2,500 in 2013 (25%), followed by $7,500 in long term gains in 2014 - those 100 BTC would cause OP to pay $10,000 in additional taxes.
If Bitcoins only became taxable when he spent them, OP would have no additional income in 2013, but would have $60,000 in ordinary income in 2014, the first $37,000 would be taxed at 25% ($9250) and the remaining $23,000 at 28% ($6,440), for a total of $15,690 in taxes.
* someone (with $50k annual salary) who mined 100 BTC at an average value of $100/coin in 2013 and had not spent them would owe only $2,500 in taxes for 2013 under current law
* if that person sold those coins at the end of 2014 for $600/coin, they would owe another $7,500 in capital gains for a total tax hit of $10,000.
* if coins were only taxable at time of conversion or time of purchase, and OP sold them for $600/BTC in 2014, that would create $60,000 of additional ordinary income, which would add $15,690 in additional taxes.

No. 
It's a one way conversion - BIT holders can convert the shares they've held for a year to GBTC, at which point they can sell them into the secondary market. There is no converting back, either from the original BIT holder and certainly not for the secondary buyer, who isn't an accredited investor (the only types of folks allowed to buy shares of BIT). 
There is a LOT of confusion it seems like. The Winklevoss twins have been working on their ETF for a couple of years now, and information about how ETF's work has filtered into consciousness.  Unfortunately, many people are now seeing an asset with the name Bitcoin in it trading where they expected COIN to trade (that's the Winklevoss ETF) and are assuming that GBTC is the ETF they've been waiting for. 
It's not. GBTC is a closed end fund that was created as a last minute exit strategy for investors in a private fund called BIT. The sec determined that the fund manager couldn't redeem investors who wanted to exit, and grayscale investments (the manager) concocted GBTC in order to provide BIT investors with an exit. It's served that purpose more than well, owing to people paying huge premiums for the privilege of buying these GBTC shares, but that doesn't mean it's a good deal for buyers. In fact, that means it's been a horrible deal for buyers, where they were willingly paying 50%, 100%, even 200% above the price of Bitcoin to buy these shares. And of course, everyone that bought prior to today is well underwater.

It's been a few years since I opened my coinbase account, and I haven't even logged in in some time. But I think I recall a personal financial questionnaire, which is standard for brokerages, banks and other financial institutions.m, where they ask things like your salary, net worth, etc. if you report a salary of $30,000 and liquid assets of $10,000, and then make purchases of $100,000 worth of Bitcoin over the next few minths, someone in compliance is going to see a redflag. Maybe they'll set it aside, maybe they'll report to their superiors. Same might happen at a stock brokerage, but they don't need to worry as much, funds enter People's accounts through other financial institutions that perform KYC, and stocks aren't bearer instruments, so out of the ordinary sized purchased of sticks at an online broker don't cause nearly the amount of alarm bells as would the same sized purchases of Bitcoin, which are then immediately withdrawn from the customers account. And once someone notices activity that could be suspicious, they have to report it or else they could become liable for penalties as well. 
So no, it's not just that buying BTC won't cause any alarms but sales will. As a regulated institution, coinbase (and likely all the others.) have to review accounts, either manually or automatically in order to be on the lookout for suspicious/out of the ordinary activity.

Nothing in their announcement says they're using Bitcoin's blockchain. Nothing. The only source for that claim that I've seen is people thinking wishfully around here. 
So what? Even if they're not using Bitcoin's blockchain, they're still proving a huge amount of validation of Bitcoin's core technology. That's big. Bigger than which particular chain they choose. I just think that we should be careful and stick with the facts rather than misstate something (like NASDAQ is using Bitcoin's blockchain) and have that thrown in our faces later on.  Like, some butter will be like "Nasdaq ended up using their own chain because Bitcoin's wasn't good enough" or even people trying to pitch Bitcoin and saying "hey, even NASDAQ is using Bitvoin now" only to find out that they aren't.  
No need to get defensive. I'm on your side. I'm just afraid that people are getting excited for what could be a non-reason (Nasdaq using Bitcoin's blockchain) rather than getting excited for a real reason (that Nasdaq is planning to use any type of blockchain is huge on its own). 
Let's cheer the facts, but only the facts, not assumptions. And if Nasdaq goes on to clarify that they're using Bitcoin's blockchain, that'll be pretty awesome. But if it turns out they're rolling their own chain, you know what? That'd be pretty awesome too.

It has great potential to be beneficial to 21. 
First off, without such an idea, they wouldn't have attracted a hundred million dollars of VC funding. 
The chips are easy to produce, and essentially free (the customer buys the device from them, reimbursing 21 for any up front costs). Let's say each device packs an asic capable of 500 mhs. That's nothing, right? Except so far, 21 hadn't had to pay for chips it's deploying, nor will it have to pay for electricity. 
Now people's devices are all mining away, all to 21s mining pool. Each consumer gets dust, essentially, but that's all that was promised to them, so they're happy that their device gets a few satoshis to sign messages with on the blockchain. 
The kicker is, say 21's pool pays out 50% to the device/device owner doing the mining, and keeps the other 50% for themselves. Now let's pretend that a million of these devices are deployed into the field. 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but is that not a 500 terrahash mining farm that cost 21 nothing to create? In fact they earned money by deploying it. They shoulder no electricity costs. They might have to bear the burden of replacing faulty units for the first year or so. 
And that's just phones,what if they sneak these chips and firmware into toasters, microwaves, refrigerators, etc?
The added electricity cost per consumer is negligible. They think they're getting a good deal since they see some satoshis winding up on their devices wallets. Meanwhile, 21 becomes the biggest, most profitable mining collaborative ever. 
All of a sudden it makes great sense to throw one of these chips into every device they can think of, rather than preloading devices with satoshis, doesn't it?
I don't know if that's their business plan, but if it isn't, then consider this post a patented idea, and I'm looking for partners. :p

To you it may seem a bad time to sell, to someone else it may be a good time to sell. Remember, any guesses about future value are just that, guesses.

Problem is, you can lead someone by the hand to set them up with Bitcoin, where the BTC to BTC part is fast and almost free, but then delayed when trying to convert back to fiat, where there might be a 4-8% fee, or you can push them towards PayPal, where the fees are certainly lower than 8%, and if you have a debit card, funds are accessible as fiat immediately upon receipt.

I don't know what got you interested in Bitcoin, but part of it fit me was the the ability to make direct payments without relying on an intermediary. All this recent talk about sons transactions not having to go on the blockchain makes me think that we're losing our way. 
I find it difficult to accept that a Bitcoin transaction had taken place at all until it's been recorded on the blockchain. Until then, it's just a note on another companies books which could be reversed, amended or altered. 
So if Bitcoin is the currency of the future, we'd best strive to make sure that every transaction can be accommodated by the blockchain. Doesn't have to happen tomorrow, no. But the future vision can't be a blockchain handling "bank" to "bank" transactions and the rest of us doing side chain and off chain transactions that exist only on the books of our wallet service. That scenario brings us right back to where we are now. Or is that not apparent?
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:47:57
Mining is what generates blocks which store transactions in irrevocable form. The network can not function without it. The 10 BTC you're storing in the blockchain is impossible to move or sell without miners. 
And miners have costs. Electricity, primarily. Rent. Capital reinvestment to replace worn out machines and upgrade older models. Oh, and they'd line to earn some profit along the way. 
The only way these costs are covered is due to block awards. As those dissipate, it's hoped and expected that fees will make up for it. But just because you only pay a penny or less to have your trabsaction processed, that doesn't mean that that's the true cost. Miners can only accept transactions with current fee levels due to the enormous subsidy they receive for solving blocks. Just because it's not an expense that comes out of your pocket doesn't mean it's not income that needs to be accounted for and replaced as the system moves forward.

I think that yes, miners do hold all the cards. Investors can't transact on the blockchain without miners. They can't sell their BTC holdings to move to an altcoin without miners. Without miners the network doesn't come to a grinding halt, it comes to a screeching stop. Investors can think they have the cards all they'ed like, but miners are the ones in control now and in the future. 
That block award are known and baked in doesn't make a difference. Mining is an extremely competitive, resource intensive activity with real costs in Fiat currency, which they're dependent on to pay for overhead, reinvest in equipment, and earn a profit. As block awards diminish, the "investors" / more accurately "users" of the network will need to make up for that lost income source in the form of paying higher fees. It's the only solution. And if they refuse, it won't take long to discover who really holds the cards, people who exchanged fiat for a new form of currency that they hope will appreciate in value, or the network of miners who have invested cash into hardware, rents and electricity that actually makes the network function, makes it possible for that new currency to appreciate in value. 
You're not seeing strikes or other shenanigans currently because miners don't hold the cards, but because of block subsidies that insure their costs are covered. Take away that subsidy or see it reduced without a rise in the price of BTC to counter that and reality will change rapidly.

Today's reality is that Bitcoin isn't a closed economy. It's roll in remittance and p2p payments is as an intermediary step, where the recipient will generally have to convert coins they receive back to fiat to gain use out of them. Therefore MasterCard isn't having to compete with the low cost of peer to peer Bitcoin transfers, they need to compete against the total cost of the trabsaction. And since we're talking about the unbanked here, their total costs are even higher, as they can't convert to fiat at ah exchange, but have to rely on local Bitcoin's type transactions where the fees/spreads are far greater than what you see on exchanges.

Even if tons of users run full nodes at home, the network is far from decentralized.

1994: 13.9%
1995: 43.1%
1996: 31.8%
1997: 34.1%
1998: 48.3%
1999: 0.5%
2000: 6.5%
2001: -6.2%
2003: 10%
The NASDAQ:
1993: 14.75%
1994: -3.2%
1995: 39.92%
1996: 22.71%
1997: 21.64%

2000: -39.29%
2001: -21.05%
2002: -31.53%
2003: 50.01%
To stop you from having to do math, $10,000 invested in each as of 12/31/1992 would have grown to $65,251 (under Buffett) and $29,595 (in the NASDAQ). 
Yes, the peak value of the NASDAQ investment would have been $60,117, and during the entire period of 1993-2003, that was the ONLY year that the value of the tech investment would have surpassed the Buffett investment. And right after that? NASDAQ to a hit that caused it to lose over 2/3 of its value.
Just giving you history. I hate people saying "oh, buffett sucks, he missed out on the tech boom". The fact of the matter is that his investments surpassed the tech's for most of the 90's, the one year where they exploded upwards was followed by a 3 year decline (loses of -39%, -21% and -31%).
TL/DR: $10,000 invested by Buffet in 1993 grew to $65k in 2003, while $10,000 invested in NASDAQ grew to $29,595 by 2003. In short, Buffett blew the techs away, he didn't "miss out" on anything.

Bill Miller
Former Legg Mason Chairman and Chief Investment Officer Bill Miller has an extraordinary returns record, at one point beating the market for 15-straight years.
And on CNBC Thursday afternoon, he said he personally owns Bitcoins. 
"Bitcoin is like a venture investment. It could go to zero, but what's interesting is the addressable market,"
“It’s like making a venture bet... You don’t know what’s going to happen, but the potential is huge.”
And again, we have no idea if he bought one, ten or a thousand coins. Just a vague "i bought some, it could go to zero or it could be huge".
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:27:23
Unfortunately, even with its strictly limited supply, Bitcoin hasn't solved this. The purchasing power of a Bitcoin has fallen far more than a dollar over the last year, for instance. And yes, over time, the value of cash stored under your mattress will decline. Fortunately, in more "normal" times, the interest rate on short term savings and longer term debt, whether CD or bonds,those interest rates have tended to exceed the rate of inflation. So while each dollar is worth less, you end up with more dollars, which has more than accounted for the loss in purchasing power. 
ThT point is never mentioned by people crying about inflation eating into the value of fiat, but it's real. Right now, yes, interest is near non existant, but I and many others believe that this is an aberration that will go away one day. 
Meanwhile, the results of speculation in the Bitcoin realm absolutely dwarf inflation. 
But at the end of the day, privacy still ranks high for me. Cash is next to non-traceable. Bank and credit card spending can be watched by bankers, regulators or law enforcement. But the blockchain is open for the world to see and analyze. Can't say I'm a fan of that. For "internet money", an alternative currency we can pick and choose when to use, it's fine. But as a primary currency? Seems far more big brotherish than any of the alternatives...

No. Seller protection only works when you ship to a verified address, and can prove delivery. A Bitcoin addres doesn't qualify, so it's impossible to prove to them that you delivered the coins as promised. 
A few years ago, I tried selling some on eBay. I was thrilled because people were bidding them up to a decent premium over market price. Over the next few months though, many of the transactions were disputed and reversed, so I definitely came out behind, compared to if I'd just sold at an exchange. 
If you don't have a bank account for people to deposit cleared funds to, then really your only option is in person. Sounds like waiting 3 days and opening an account is your best option. Then you won't need to go the LBC route at all, just sell at an exchange.

The protocol hadn't been hacked, but brain wallets, android generated wallets, exchange storage (hot and cold)and nearly every other service running on top of that protocol have been hacked. And due to the infallibility of the Bitcoin protocol, none of those losses have been recovered. Some were clearly users faults (brain wallets, many exchange thefts), others not so much (android wallet thefts, when they were only guilty of linking to a flawed library)
It's a double edged sword, I'm honestly not sure if we want to draw attention to it. At its core, the Bitcoin protocol is rather simple, which is good - complexity breeds insecurity, but fewer and fewer (on a percentage basis) are transacting directly via the blockchain and there's more and more pressure to push transactions over to side chains or off the chain altogether, which would mean no matter how secure the basic Bitcoin protocol is, most won't be exposed to it or rely on it, instead having to trust the security of their service providers.

No offense, but you really don't know how the stock market works. Not to worry, it's clear many people commenting here, and on previous GBTC relAted posts don't have much of an idea either. Which makes me really go back and question so much else that people say around here. 
No guarantee that that premium will be there when they sell. And no, this device isn't for large investors looking to drop large amounts of cash into Bitcoin. It's been created to provide BIT investors with a way to exit their investments. Those large investors are looking at the premium to NAV and saying no thank you. Only 765 shares traded today. 76.5 Bitcoins worth. 
They can feel holier than thou all they like, but that won't make them actual money. 
I'm thinking we need a betting pool - I would happily wager everything I have that a year from now, BTC would have been the far better investment that GBTC. That isn't even a bet that Bitcoin itself will appreciate, just that you'll have made more or lost less by buying BTC rather than GBTC at these levels. Wanna take me up on that?

So every team is its own insurance company? With their own risk managers, lawyers, actuaries, etc? Which they'll need, else they'll get screwed. Unless they simply agree not to make otherwise valid payouts. 
It's easy to be an insurer when all you're doing is collecting premiums. Clients aren't concerned with "are they going to get my premium or not?" They're concerned with if they'll get paid when a payout event happens. Your system does nothing to address that. 
And I admit, I skimmed your white paper. 
You get it wrong. Even from the premise that insurers only pay out on 60% of the premiums they collect. That right there is wrong. Statistically, insurers tend to lose money or break even (at best) on their premium collections, paying out more than they take in over the longer term. But they make up for it by investing that money and earning returns on it. 
So even from the staring premise, you're off. It seems like you didn't get the payout you wanted after a fender bender, and decided to rewrite the insurance industry as a result.

Lets see.... 
70 GB block chain. 
Cost of a 4 TB external hard drive: $120.
5600 nodes and falling
Me thinks that storage space is of no consequence here. Anyone wanting to run a node, at home, can do so for a pittance, whether the block size is 1 MB or 2 MB.
Conversely - if nodes hosted in datacenters are no good for decentralization, then perhaps the goal should be to increase the size of the block chain so that people stop running them on spin-up VPS's.
I'm seeing 346 at OVH, 207 at Amazon, 79 at Hurricane Electric, 73 at Digital Ocean, 68 at Google, 38 at Softlayer, 37 at Free SAS, 33 on Azure, 30 at Rackspace, another 25 at Amazon, 10 at 1&amp;1
So, nearly 20% of current nodes at are datacenters, just at a quick glance. I'm sure the number is much higher than that, I just don't recognize all the names.
The point is, only an incredibly small portion of the network is willing to run nodes, despite the incredibly small resource requirements (a Pi has enough processing power, after all, and I already pointed out the cost of storage).
If anyone shuts down their node because it's using 100GB of space in a year or two, well, they weren't much support to the network in the first place.

Well, if quantum computers were rolled out tomorrow (meaning they were pitted against today's systems), SSL would be defunct, meaning no more ecommerce, no more online banking, no more Bitcoin. No more authentication, so no more signed messages or signed code. So the Internet as we know it, at least for transacting and distributing software and software updates, that would be "upended". Or is that too subtle of a word?

It's not like "bad" addresses are hidden, nor are there very many of them to keep track of. If customer X buys coins, sends them to address Y, and then the coins go to address Z which is a known darknet hot wallet, it's not too hard to surmise that address Y was a depisit address for that DNM
Is it coinbases fault for noticing this when they're obliged to be on the lookout for it? Users could easily have taken steps to give themselves plausible deniability for such a transaction rather than send straight to the market. 
The thing that people need to know is that Bitcoin is not anonymous. It wasn't designed as such. Transactions Are on the blockchain to be analyzed forever and ever. And once you associate anything about yourself with one of your addresses (email addy, forum user nsme, or if you bought from an exchange that conducts KYC/AML checks then basically all your info is available), then it becomes easier and easier to assmble a picture of someone's holdings and transactional history, even from separate addresses (where coins from two addresses might have been combined during a send transaction). Too often people think that BTC is anonymous simply because their name isn't tied directly to their wallet addresses. Hopefully things like this will serve as a wake up call 
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:26:44
Currently miners are paid $7 or $8 to process each transaction. That cost is abstracted from the end user who on pays a couple of cents, with the rest of the money being created in the form of the block award. Take away the reward, leave the 1Mb block size in place, and transactions will be so prohibitively expensive no one will want to transact. You hope they'll end up on a side chain or off chain altogether, or maybe they won't see the point of even using Bitcoin if they can't "be their own bank". Or they all go off chain, and then why do we need tons of nodes, users everywhere being able to run their own node, if there are relatively few transactions occurring on the main chain?
The only way that Bircoins fees will stay reasonable is by having huge numbers of transactions per block. Otherwise we're basically laying out bait before pulling the switch. 
Today: "Yes! Use Bitcoin! It's frictionless, transaction costs are mere pennies no matter how big or small the transaction"
Tomorrow: "I'm sorry, but the cost of transacting on the blockchain is $10, and you'd better have a good reason for doing so. How can you spend your bitcoins, you ask? Simple, send them to this trusted wallet service, they'll keep your coins nice and safe, and then you'll be able to transact with any vendor who uses them as a payment processor without touching the blockchain"
What am I not seeing? How do we retain control of our private keys while transacting only off chain or on side chains? And wouldn't this off chain scenario breed an extremely centralized environment, where everyone would open wallet accounts with the biggest service, and therefore vendors would choose them because that's where the users are, so more users would opt to be with them... Then all transactions are taking place off chain, on that one providers books. How do we make sure such a service is kept honest? 
On the blockchain, I can look up how many coins are in my wallet. And I know no one can pull any shenanigans with them. Side chains or off chain? Huge step backwards. I keep reading people's hopes for such futures, but none seem to give any thought to the effect that off chain transactions would have in creating a new centralized sphere of power, not the huge questions related to trust and security that such a move would create. 
Am I misunderstanding? Or if not, what is a solution besides "that will be fixed one day"?
Unless I'm completely mistaken, I think the the solution is to keep the transacting on the main chain rather than advocating for it to be spun off into some private companies hands. 
Again, what am I missing?

How do you propose dis incentivizing pools? And how would you make chants to he protocol in order to do so?
Pools exist because the odds of someone mining a block on their own are astronomically low - people therefore mine together and split the rewards according to how much each of them contributed to the work done. 
There is no way altering the protocol can alleviate that, unless it's a complete rewrite of the entire concept.... But that won't be bitcoin anymore, because the bitcoin community is comfortable having millions and millions and millions of low cost specialized chips doing the work to validate transactions. 
What you want is an altcoin. First think out how exactly you can stop this from happening at the most fundamental level (if your scheme is doing proof of work, how can you prevent two or more participants from combining their efforts), have it developed, and then show the world why they should either adopt your methods within bitcoin, or else abandon bitcoin and go after your new coin instead.

No reason at all, no. At least not At this price. And judging from the volume today, 765 shares, there likely weren't any takers besides irrationally exuberant Bitcoin investors. 
I get buying in hopes of the spread widening, and certainly a few people did just that today. But when you're already at a 50% premium to NAV, it's not q wise move at all. In the coming days, a week or two possibly (to borrow a phrase from BFL) Id expect GBTC to trade more inline with its Net Asset Value, rather than for its currently outlandish premium. Whether that's the result of BTC prices going up or GBTC's premium declining, or a mixture of both, is anyone's guess. But I'll say it again and again, buying $24 worth of assets for $38 is never a good strategy for making money. Never. People can come up with whatever reasons they'Ed like to try to justify it, but it won't stick. 
From my angle, people who bought today with the intention of holding are in for pain. Either GBTC trends down to meet BTC's price, in which case they lose, or BTC trends up to meet GBTC's pruce, in which case those investors should have bought Bitcoin. What will be morosely amusing will be Bitcoin having an increasing price while GBTC's premium goes away, then there will be a bunch of befuddled investors here asking why they're underwater on their GBTC investment even though the price of Bitcoin has gone up. 
For reference and research, go and look up other closed end funds, their trading price and their NAV. You'll find most trading at a discount to NAV, and of the ones that do trade at a premium, you'll be hard stretched to find a premium even close to GBTC's. 
thia isn't a knock on Bitcoin mind you, just GBTC, and specifically on the people who are buying shares at these prices trying to convince themselves they got a good deal. They didn't.

GBTC is a closed end fund, not an ETF; as I recall there is no exchange/basket creation mechanism, and if there were, it would be limited to Authorizrd Participants (ie broker/dealers who have a preexisting agreement with the fund. That prices are this far out of whack should prove that there is no arbitrage mechanism.

Follow up: this is reaching back to when I studied for the 65. Things that you wouldn't necessarily think are securities can become them, and therefore regulatable by the SEC. 
A barrel of whiskey. In you own possession, it's just alcohol. But if a distiller wants to raise money to expand their operations, and they sell you a receipt or title of ownership to a barrel of whiskey that's aging in their warehouse, that receipt is a security according to the law. It's offered to you with the hope of achieving a return on your investment. 
So, just because the SEC doesn't regulate Bitcoin, don't think for a second they won't regulate investment vehicles that invest in bitcoin.

I kind of get what you're saying, but I think the issue extends far beyond Satoshi. We've got a currency that many think can and will take over the world, except 5 years in nearly 2/3 of all the coins that will ever exist already exist, and they're in the hands of a couple hundred thousand people, many of whom want to hold. hiw is demand supposed to go from a few hundred thousand to billions? How are the coins supposed to pripogate?
Scarcity, as in the 21 million cap, is not the issue; rather the issue would (could) be that the stock of Bitcoin's was generated far too rapidly, leaving the entire coin supply in a very consolidated group of hands. It's not whining ably being late to the party, but a slower generation rate would have insured fresh supply reaching the markets as interest was (if it does) reaching critical mass. 
So no, if there's an issue with consolidated holdings, the problem isn't Satoshi, it's all of us.

How do you think this isn't enforcable on Wall Street? Broker dealers keep transaction records for years, and as of the last couple of years, they've moved (well, been required to) to report tax basis on purchases (i.e., reporting each of your stock purchases to the IRS, along with reporting the sales of each stock, which they've done all along). So, all that information is going to the IRS already, if some one thinks "oh, i just won't report this, how could they possibly know?", they'll learn that the fastest way to an IRS inquiry or worse, audit, is to not report everything on your tax return that has been reported to the IRS as well
As for Bitcoins, if your transacting through a US regulated entity, then if they're not required already, they likely will soon be required to conduct the same tax basis reporting requirements.
What innovation is being stifled by attempting to slow down the HFT crowd?  I myself think they're a huge negative , providing no benefit to anyone but themselves. To everyone else, they're an additional piece of friction, standing to slightly increase the cost of the securities for every buyer, slightly decrease the proceeds received from by each seller, at the very least...
Some taxes are meant to generate income. Others are for rewarding or penalyzing behavior that is wanted or not wanted (just as so many states put forward the logic that for every $1 added to the cost of a pack of cigarettes via taxes, this many more people will quite smoking). This one falls mainly in the second, attempting to penalize behavior that is not wanted.

Thanks to the blockchain, if you claim you don't have coins anymore that were reported to have been purchased by you, the IRS could request the address that you withdrew them from from your exchange and then extrapolate when they were sold by looking for the transaction when they left that address. 
Have they done so already? Doubtful. Could they? Absolutely, the blockchain is a permanent record. Even if you tried to say "no, I didn't sell my coins on that date, I just moved them to this address, and then sold them at this later date", absent proof, the IRS would likely choose the date when BTC was priced highest.

Why you'd include 09 and 10 is baffling - that's a meaningless period as far as projections go - just as its beyond unlikely that we'll see Bitcoin make the sort of gains it did from 09 to present, nor should we include that period when projecting future growth.

Im having trouble believing you. Making multiple deposits of $9,900 would certainly spring off red flags at even the most lax bank for trying to structure deposits to get around the $10k reporting require r , which is exactly what you're doing. 
I too have worked with businesses that accepted and deposited large sums of cash (a car dealer in this instance) and it was nowhere near as painful. Collect customer info on an IRS form for transacting that much cash, bring deposit to bank, upon seeing that the deposit totals more than $10k the computer automatically prints the required IRS forms. If it didn't for some reason, then you call a manager to make sure it's been handled properly. But never has it taken hours, unless your bank doesn't happen to have a cash counting machine.  
But yeah, if you're repeatedly depositing just shy of $10k specifically to avoid reporting (which is the only reason they'll conclude if they're reviewing the banks books and records), when that gets noticed the IRS will come down like a ton of bricks. Bad decision. Maybe your old employer lucked out, or maybe that moment of reckoning is still to come. Either way, hopefully no one else follows in those footsteps!

I think a lot of people here are making a big deal out of what's essentially nothing. A foundations purpose is to spend money - that's what they're there for. So, if a foundation spends money but doesn't take money in, of course it'll run out.
Private Foundations try to exist in perpetuity; they have to give away 5% of their assets every year as grants, etc, and hope to grow their assets by having investment gains above and beyond that. 
Operating Foundations are grant recipients and can spend how they see fit, so long as it furthers their cause. 
My guess is that the Bitcoin Foundation was/is an operating foundation, and though obviously the summary of spending given here isn't authoritative, it certainly doesn't seem like anything was done "wrong". They might have run out of money, but they didn't have a fiduciary duty to preserve assets (as one might see in a private foundation), just to spend the assets in a manner which would further its mission.

Did you complain also about the 7 up votes, or just the 6 down votes?
@_date: 2016-03-28 23:37:57


False. 
A few years ago there was a fork (i think they changed the database in a new release of Bitcoin) that lasted for several hours. There was a fork that the new version of Bitcoin was on (which was longest), and there was the fork that all the unupgraded nodes were running. Ultimately, it wasn't the longest chain that won, but a rollback and and patch to the new Bitcoin code that maintained backward compatibility with the old chain.
So... Longest chain isn't necessarily the winner. Just as people here say that an XT or Classic chain that overtook Core's would not be the valid chain, either, but that's less clear than the fork that already occurred, since, in that fork, there wasn't even technically a rule change, just lack of backward compatibility (which I suppose would be a rule change).

Depends who can hold out longer; if miners currently collect $8/transaction including the block subsidy, and they're suddenly offered 5 cents per transaction, most would scoff at the idea and idle their equipment rather than accept a payment level that guarantees huge losses. It wouldn't take too long of a strike to bring spenders in line; either accept a new fee level as reality, or your coins will never move again. 
It's not egalitarian, miners hold all the cards. So long as they all act in their own best interests, which is to not mine blocks where the rewards guarantee long term losses, then they'll win the battle of wills.

Autos and Housing are hugely different.
There are no protections for auto buyers. Miss a payment and your car can be repossessed the next day. Most subprime autos have trackers installed, to simplify the job of the Repoman. 
Miss a mortgage payment? It could be years before the bank is able to reclaim control of their property.
In the housing bubble, there was no care given to the quality of the loans because of the belief that no matter what, the underlying value would continue increasing, enabling future refinances, and insuring (falsely)  that the lenders would be made whole in the event of a default. 
Neither is true about cars. No ones lending on autos thinking "if they miss their payment, I can just take the car back and sell it to someone else for even more". Cars are depreciating assets. And this is priced in - when subprime mortgages were just a few hundred basis points over regular mortgages, subprime auto loans were typically at whatever the maximum rate was available in a given state. In Florida, that was 29%.
Further, dealers and financiers build this into their business plan. Some even assume the typical car will be repossessed within 6 months. This lets them basically keep reselling the same car over and over again (or selling the car at auction and replacing it with an equivalent).
No one but no one is investing in auto loans with their blinders on. As said, cars are assets that lose value rapidly, not ones whose values are expected to increase over time. That in and of itself completely changes the dynamic. And no one is trying to hide how awful their assets are when selling them to financiers, there are no "prime" tranches of auto ABS's that are actually stuffed full of "Buy here pay here" crap.
Lastly, people are far more likely to make their auto payment than their mortgage payment. Fail to make your auto payment and you lose your car, ability to work, etc. And when they do fail and lose their car, they're right back at the same lot getting another car all over again, making a whole new down payment, which is basically the only cash an unscrupulous dealer counts on.
Fail to make the mortgage payment, you move.

The entire purpose of the tax is disincentivize high frequency trading, which is solely the domain of Wall Street. You, me and everyone else reading this, unless they work for a HFT hedge fund like Renaissance Technologies, we don't trade even close to what they do.

Define temporarily and worthwhile. A state such as the U.S. Could easily ramp up the resources to 51% the Bitcoin network in far more than a temporary fashion. And worthwhile... Are you defining worth as making money through double spends? That's what people normally consider in terms of 51% at tacks - that no one would attempt such an attack because the costs incurred versus the gains to be had from doublesoends versus the decline in value that would occur due to shaken confidence. That rules out such attacks for personal gain, yes. But if the goal is to sink the network, destroy confidence in it or even the ability to transact, then it's hard to see why it wouldn't be worthwhile. 
Yes, miners could engage in an arms race of sorts, deploy more and more hash power to combat it. But who in their right minds would throw good money after bad in trying to beat out a state actor?
So no. If a state truly wanted to do away with Bitcoin, take steps beyond just declaring it illegal, a 51% attack would be one easy but costly way of doing it. Another option would be to DDOs the nodes or mining pools.
Thankfully no states have taken such steps. But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that just because they haven't, that they can't. Would they, though? That's the bigger question. I personally doubt it. Even in a small state with apparently low barriers, etc, like Argentina, Bitcoin barely registers.

miners make the blocks. They're the deciders of what goes in them, how big they are, and just about everything else. It's on us to decide if we want to use the network that they maintain and operate for us. Miners could make changes that break the network (by changing the core rules like block reward), but so long as 51% of them are aligned with our and their own interests, then it'll continue to operate. 
Even without a block size cap, no pool or farm would have any reason to build that fabled 1gb block, which would allow them to have an huge time lead over the others in trying to solve the next block, for the simple reason that the rest of the network (supposing they has less than 50% hash power) would solve another valid block and build off that one instead. 
So no, satoshi fully understood what he was doing in that regard. It's this layer crop that's deviating from something so simple. 
And your Bitcoinocracy votes are of no value. At all. They represent the wishes of holders of what? $8 million ok bitcoins. That's less than 0.2% of the coins out there, and likely less than 5% of the amount miners have invested in securing the network. It's of no value at all. Beyond none. It's absurd that you even think it has value. 
It's been the rage for the last year or two to say satoshi didn't know what Bitcoin would do. That's false. His vision was strikingly similar. But the project is now being spearheaded by two guys that said, almost from day 1, "Bitcoin can't work". More and more, I wish their primary motivation would have been to make it work, rather than expend all this energy trying to change its course. Because, yes, they are smart guys, no doubt. But I think the egos have gotten too big. Which is another thing satoshi got right, by not even letting us know who he was.

Let blockstream do their thing, and let others do their own thing. 
Moving to 2mb (or larger) blocks shouldn't pose a threat to lightning, if it's all that they say it is. If it's actually only valuable due to a constrained blocksize, then we'll see the market vote by not using it.

Building code with future hard forks in mind wouldn't slow things down considerably, it would just require forethought. Ie: "we don't need this now, but let's build the capability in for when we do"
And again, I think you're mistaken abou "particular transactions". RBF is an individual transaction thing - if your node can recognize an RBF transaction you can choose to handle it differently. SegWit is not in any way analogous. SegWit is essentially a new block format - therefore older nodes won't be reduced to SPV status only for SegWit transactions, they become reduced to SPV status the moment a SegWit block is mined. if they're unable to validate one block, they'll be unable to validate any block built on top of that. It's far more radical than being unable to verify individual transactions. 
Last part. On fast hard forks. 
I agree, they shouldn't be quickly deployed. But this isn't a rash decision. This has been discussed for a long time now. Solutions have been proposed months ago, before we got to situation critical. Many view (including the classic devs, to my knowledge), that the scaling Bitcoin conferences were simply a stalling tactic. Meanwhile it's gotten more dire, and people are putting forward a solution. 
I'm personally thinking it's the right one. A) because it fixes a short term need. And B) because it'll do what I suggested earlier - force off the nodes the network that can't bother to upgrade. 
Look at it this way. Suppose there are 6,000 nodes. And let's assume 50% are outdated won't bother updating software. 
After a fork, hard or soft, there will only be 3,000 fully validating nodes on the network. But in the event of a soft fork, there's another 3,000 nodes that still think theyre fully validating. 
Do you really think that having those 3,000 non validating nodes helps anything, security or decentralization wide? No. They're garbage. Whereas with a hard fork, we'd know that the active nodes are actually real, fully validating nodes. 
I say go for it. There's been enough talk on the topic, time to do something. Maybe there's a little disruption in the short term. Sucks, but I'd rather see disruption in an asset with a $6 bn market cap and maybe a million users than wait and have to introduce similar disruption if/when there are a billion users and it represents an asset worth $600 billion.

Thinking 100 years out about the impact Bitcoin/block chain tech could have, and only offering abstract results ("by itself or with other abstract tools, it could be responsible for a magnitudinal increase in productivity"), is really counting chickens before they hatch, don't you think? At this point there's no real proof it'll even catch on. 
This rarer than gold thing is also bothering me. Who says its rarer? Because there are 21 million on them? But in actuality, there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 actual/potential units. With more possible if it's ever appropriate to divide past the Satoshi. Sounds like an awefuk lot to me. But really, comparing something that exists only in the physical realm to something else that only exists in the technological realm and saying ones more rare than the other, it's not fact. It's just you saying it is because it suits your point, when in actuality there is no definitive way to establish which is rarer. Do you follow?
It sounds great to say that Bitcoin is the biggest financial innovation in 1000 years, but once you exclude all the others by pushing back the dates to points in time where they hardly even resemble what they are today, well that doesn't sit well either.

Right. Coinbase shouldn't be used as a wallet. They should be used as an exchange. Which you need to transact with in order to convert your fiat into Bitcoin, which you can then send to your wallet.
Making it easier to buy Bitcoins is just that, making it easier to Buy bitcoins. Those holders will need to be educated so as to figure out for themselves whether they feel comfortable having Coinbase be their bank, or if they want to take control of their coins themselves. But that's a different story.
Unless Coinbase actively prohibits sending Bitcoins to non-coinbase addresses, I can't see how this news could be frowned upon.

Is not wanting to leave your bitcoins in a third parties Lightning hub a valid use case? Because otherwise, you every time you want to effect a Lightning transaction, you'll need to make an on-chain transaction from your wallet into the Hub first.

No, raising the blocksize is their method for pre-emptively foreclosing the possibility of attacks against Lightning (spam flood causing mass expiration of time-locked transactions)
*his permits miners to agree on raising the block size limit with- out requiring frequent hard-forks from clients, so long as the amount raised by miners does not go over the clients’ hard limit. This mitigates the risk of mass expiry of transactions at once. All transactions which are not re- deemed via Exercise Settlement (ES) may have a very high fee attached, and miners may use a consensus rule whereby those transactions are exempted from the soft-cap, making it very likely the correct transactions will enter the blockchain.*

They do add value.
Not necessarily as stock pickers - if that's all you think a finance manager does, then yes, that's true - by and large the professionals have difficulty matching the performance of indexes over long periods, with some exceptions that anyone would be very lucky indeed to come across.
But as asset allocators, they can still ad value - even things such as portfolio rebalancing that most people don't think to do. And in that sense, as Bitcoin is an asset that most people aren't aware of, there could be something there.
But by and large, for most of the populace, a wealth manager or investment advisor would not be likely to recommend such an investment. If anything, a wealth manager patrolling might remind people that diversification is a good thing, and recommend people not maintain 50 or 75% of their wealth in Bitcoin alone, or in Bitcoin and Gold. But no one wants to hear that stocks, bonds, and cash etc all have well-deserved places in peoples investment portfolios.

You're talking a retail customer account. But, ok, even so. If you open a retail account and buy shares of a mutual fund, a few days later you'll receive a prospectus in the mail, outlining everything you need to know about that mutual fund - managers, their strategy, the funds holdings, and, yes, risk factors.
Now take a several billion dollar investment. Think that type of client won't react if, say, you forget to mention a slight risk factor, specifically that the product you're selling them was designed specifically to fail, and that you created it for another investor and just need them to be their counterparty?
Arbitration is for retail investors. Not hedge funds, pension funds, etc. Besides, once someone or an entity in regulated finance steps out of bounds (not making full disclosure in this case), whatever agreement you have with your client gives you no protection, because they can just go the SEC.

Pardon me, but it's my understanding that increasing the blocksize would only increase storage requirements if there are enough transactions to merit it. Ie, in our current world iof 1mb blocks, blocksize can range from something minuscule up to 1MB tops, and that 990kb block will still only require 990lb, regardless of whether the max blocksize is 1mb or 20mb
That's my understanding, at least. Am I wrong? Because if not, I don't see what the pushback against increasing the blocksize is about- if there are 20mb worth of transactions that need to process, either they could be put into 1 new block, or would have to be spread across 20 1mb blocks, over the course of approximately 200 minutes. Seems the first situation is the more optimal one, no? It doesn't sound like increasing the block size will result in spiraling storage demands, unless the transaction level merits that. 
Or am I missing something?  Does 1 block consume 1Mb currently, regRdlesd of whether there are 5 or 500 transactions in it? And would that hold true for 20 mb blocks, a block containing a single transaction would require 20 mob of storage space?
Only if that last paragraph is true would I understand why people are opposed to increasing the block size. 
So what is it? You seem like you know a bit, that's why Im asking you... Thanks! :)

It doesn't matter whether the transaction is US-based or not, if its a US person doing the transacting, that's what matters.

A) Already, just about every bitcoin transaction by a US person is a taxable event - recall, that bitcoins are taxed as investment assets, where your gains and losses can be short term or long term based on your holding period.
If you buy 1 BTC one day for $250 and the next day the day the price goes up to $252, which is exactly how much you need to buy that comforter on Overstock.com, so you go ahead, order it, and pay with that same bitcoin, you have a taxable transaction, which will result in a $2 short term capital gain on next years taxes. 
B) My understanding is that the tax is extremely low, basically to be more or less negligible to long term investors and even short term traders. Where it packs a wallop is for the high frequency traders, who can log thousands of transactions in a day.
C) Unless your income is greater than $200k per year, the odds are that the net result of this bill to you will be a lower overall tax bill.

I think bitcoin is a pretty cool idea/technology, and also intend to hold what i have... Only as an investment in the idea of "don't risk more than you can afford to lose" mantra.
I DON'T however see it as a means to ending a "tyrannical" system... It's a unit of account, nothing more, nothing less. If Bitcoin became the dominant unit of account, not a thing would change, as far as I can tell.
Taxes would still be owed, and governments would have a good idea of knowing what you earned. An even better idea than the current system vis a vis cash and customers who may or may not issue 1099's etc.
The current "rich" would still be rich. If they wanted or needed, they could easily shift their wealth to bitcoin and remain in their elite status. Of course many bitcoiners await that moment with baited breath, thinking "if a few billionaires pour their monies into Bitcoin, it'll cause a huge upward shift in value" for them.
The "state" will still have guns to enforce their rules if necessary.
And despite so many people saying how awesome bitcoin is in that if you have your private key, no one can abscond with or confiscate your funds, ultimately, most people entering the "scene" these days are intent on using exchanges as their wallets, meaning that their funds are just as valuable as they would be in a bank...
Even debt, that elephant in the room that everyone shouts about, that won't go away. Shifting from dollars to bitcoin won't force anyone or any country to have to live within their preset means. If a government can borrow dollars from their citizens or other countries to fund their operations, they can just as easily borrow bitcoins from people who have have enough that they're sitting idle. Same with credit cards.
At the end of the day, nothing really changes. A new stateless currency doesn't change the game or pull the carpet out from under the current system. It does provide people with a new means of spending or saving that's not bound by limitations imposed by banks, that's for certain, and that's great. But lets not get so far ahead of ourselves that we think that this could possibly tear down the system as we know it now. 
And even more importantly, lets not be so stubborn as to think that tearing down the system that exists currently will be of benefit to the vast majority of us. Such an event would be a jarring, painful experience that would likely take a generation or two to adjust to, as everything we know and take for granted for now would, by definition, be gone.

Yes, "legitimate" users can simply bump their fee. But what happens when or if a well resourced entity attacks the network, and floods it with transactions with 1 BTC fees? The miners will celebrate, that's for sure, but the simple solution of "just increase your fee" won't work, at all.

SegWit doesn't automatically increase blocksize to 1.75Mb. It depends on everything being rewritten to write SegWit compatible transactions. Even if every node updates to SegWit, but I don't update my electrum wallet, I'm still making old-style transactions. Likewise, the attacks and stress tests we've seen could still just use old style transactions and fill blocks to the 1 mb limit.
Whereas in a hard fork scenario, only the nodes and miners need to upgrade. Thin wallets like electrum continue to work fine. Block explorers should work fine or with only the most minimal changes. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:41:18


Except they won't be - they'll be transacting on Lightning, and to the extent that they keep their transactions on Lightning, there will be no transactions for them to verify and validate on their own cheap nodes.
Likewise, the minimal cost of running a node is and will be dirt cheap regardless of whether the block size is 1 MB or 2 MB. Look at the price of a 4 TB drive. It'll die long before it gets full at either block size.

When you make an investment, it's best to forget the prix you paid for it. You can't be tethered to that, as all it is is a snapshot of a certain moment in time.

If a hard fork were to occur, it would because of consensus. Maybe not 100%, and maybe 100% of the Core developers are part of that sliver that's opposed.
But miners won't start mining blocks unless they're certain that people will buy those coins. Exchanges won't switch to accept those coins unless they know that there is a market for them. And, as Adam just stated, there does seem to exist a majority across every sector of the Bitcoin economy, save for within the Core Developers themselves.
That sounds like a pretty strong case.
Should that happen, nothing about Bitcoin has broken SAVE for the current leaderships vision of Bitcoin as a purely settlement only system. Everything else is intact. No lobbying for changing proof of work, block rewards, or anything else, simply not letting a anti-spam measure be used for something it was never intended for - a cap on economic activity.
That is why Classic is called Class - it's reverting to the set of rules we all knew and expected coming into the system. I know that in 2012, even then the 7 TPS limit was noticeably low, but there soon followed discussion that it would have to be raised at some point. I wish i could point to those Bitcointalk threads. But never, did I or so many other people imagine that it would be allowed to linger and reshape the system.
No, transactions will not be free forever. They're already not free. But miners are compensated amply for them at the current time. To try to create an artificial fee market, where none is needed at this time, is counterintuitive to the goal of seeing Bitcoins usage expand.
That's a ramble. I know.
But the point is, removing a temporary measure made years ago will not mean that Bitcoin has failed. And if that's really how you feel, then I'm sorry, but those of us that stick around may not miss those that stick to their guns to such extremes.
Tim Berners Lee didn't put a permanent cap on the size of a web page. Microsoft Office users have to upgrade their software in order to maintain compatibility with their peers. There is zero reason that an economic system should be tethered to the capabilities of the participants in it who refuse to update their software, or who have left nodes running on abandoned VPS's, which is essentially what soft forks cater to.
I, and many, many others simply disagree with your premise.

How would you censor on chain transactions?
You can't block a recipient from getting bitcoins, because anyone can create any number of addresses, none of which are linked to their identity. 
You could refuse to relay transactions from "bad" addresses, but u less every node implements the same policy, the transaction will end up getting to miners anyways. And if every node is refusing to allow a Bitcoin address to transact, then you can't get those coins to a hub in the first place. 
Meanwhile, anything we say or think about Lightning is meaningless, since there's no implementation and everything is subject to change.

The thing is, despite the naysaying, zero conf transactions have so far been shown to be reasonably secure. Not perfectly secure, but good enough that merchants could base their businesses around it. RBF changes that completely, by turning it for from being extremely unlikely that a broadcast transaction could be double spent to being trivial. 
And the thing around here is that unforuntately there exist a sizable contingent who would take advantage just because they could, with zero repercussions if they succeed. Do enough charge backs on your credit card and whether you were acting honestly or not, your account will get closed. 
Its silly that people don't see the difference. We all knew that bitcoin is irreversible, adding logic to it for that allows a transaction to potentially be reversed (but not even guaranteed to be) just adds fartoo much unneeded complexity and seems mainly destined to open a new attack vector.

What SashimiManicoti :) is saying is that with GBTC trading at such a premium to BTC, holders of BIT (the fund whose shares can be converted to GBTC) would be well advised (IMO) to convert to GBTC and sell into the market, at least until the price of GBTC is close to the price of a tenth of a Bitcoin. And that selling would push the price of GBTC down. 
Right now, it's essentially a risk free proposition 
To use small numbers, say you own 10 shares of GBTC. You want to maintain at least 1 BTC's worth of exposure on the long side. You can sell those 10 shares and collect $410, then turn around and buy 1 BTC for a little less than $240. 
You still have your 1 BTC long position, but you also have $170 in cash.  
There is zero reason for GBTC to trade at such premiums in the long term (or even the short term in my opinion), so BIT holders who have held long enough to be able to convert are essentially leaving free money on the table by not doing so. 
And to head it off now, I'm sure someone will say that maybe those holders are waiting for even bigger premiums before selling; greed pure and simple, and hardly a guaranteed winning strategy - there is no reason under the sun for an investment vehicle that owns 1/10 of a Bitcoin and nothing more (and holds it, they don't engage in trading strategies in hopes of multiplying those Bitcoin's), no reason for that vehicle to be worth any more than 1/10 of a Bitcoin. 
While there might be short term blips when the spread widens for some reason (ie a dumb buyer willing to pay $40 for a $20 bill) in the long term that spread has to disappear. People who hold now anticipating the spread widening risk seeing it contract instead. 
TLDR: there's currently lunch on the table. People who bought tickets to it a year ago right now can sell those tickets to other people and still get to eat that lunch. Many appear to be holding out for better offers, at the risk of not getting that free lunch at all. 
I don't think that's a good analogy, actually, but it's all I've got.

He introduced this as a temporary cludge, absolutely, but clearly expected it to be removed and lifted from future versions, and gave an example of how to do so in as non-disruptive manner as possible (insert code into current clients that activates at a much later block, so that nodes upgrade for other refinements the future block size limit is included as well, so that when that block height is finally reached, all nodes within a few versions of current have the correct code.
That's a pretty decent remedy to a kludge of a solution. Instead we seem to be bending over backwards to accommodate node operators who for whatever reason refuse to keep current with their software.

There is zero indication that that would in fact happen, and also zero indication that that won't happen under a smaller blocks scenario. It's all speculation, one way or the other.

Never worked in the insurance industry myself, but I had a boss that was chairman of a small public insurance co, and all of his friends were insurance bigwigs, so I learned a little through osmosis. 
Still don't see a real conflict of interest, but I can see how people might think that their insurer is on their side. And even though they aren't really, 95% of the time they are and they fulfill exactly what expected from them. But the problem is in that remaining 5% are tons of scammers, etc, that for them to "have the consumers back" and fulfill every claim, then rates would have to go up across the board, which would make that first 95% upset. 
The problem is it's not in the insurers or their sales guys interest to tell their customers that, while they will generally pay out, they will try to minimize what they payout. That car you bought a year ago, you're not going to get the same amount that you paid for it, things like that.

@_date: 2016-03-08 15:22:35
I'd disagree that it is the only proposal to incentivize.
The bigger issue is that Bitcoin needs to continually increase in value, such that the BTC denominated block awards and fees that miners get will continue to pay their overhead and allow for a decent profit when they inevitably convert the BTC they earn to fiat. 
Whether its because lightning bundles a ton of transactions as one and bundles a huge fee with that transaction (though, there's no real reason a settlement transaction from a lightning node would have to pay any more than they do currently), or because blocks get bigger and allow more individual transactions, that's the debate - which of the two paths should be followed...

Problem is then there are no checks and bounds to keep the size under control. What if the max block size keeps increasing and increasing even if the capacity isn't needed? Won't we then need another hard fork to keep it in check?
Can't we abstract all this?
Like let clients read blocks of any size, rather than be expecting blocks up to a set maximum size? And nodes just forwarding transactions to miners without regard for block sizes? Then it's just up to the miners to create blocks of whichever size they agree on? Something like that, so that in the future, changes can be made to things like blocksize without disrupting every layer on top of it? Then underlying changes could be made without fear of disrupting every cluent, every node, etc?

But can you provide any empirical data that changing from 1 MB blocks to 2 MB blocks will have any appreciable impact on node count? I mean, nodes have fallen form 100,000 to 5,000, makes one think that nodes aren't falling off the network in response to block size at all. But because the protocol provides no incentive for running them unless one is a miner, or service provider with the actual need to maintain a copy of blockchain.
Also, empirically, can you provide the exact number at which the node count needs to reach for it to be considered "centralized", or even "not decentralized enough"? Is it 4, 400, 4000 or what? Or is it just subject to each persons discretion, in which case there is no way to provide data-driven anything since its all subjective.

From an objective point of view, it's pretty clear that Blockstream is directing development seeing as BIP's are being integrated into the protocol for the sole purpose of enabling the hooks that Lightning will need to function.

If core continued on its own fork with a quarter of the hash power, it would likely die a slow death as people found it unacceptable to use. 
Block times would be 40 minutes on average, with a nearly 2 month wait for the next difficulty adjustment. And even then, short of a second hard fork, there's a set limit to how far difficulty can fall each adjustment. So it could be half a year or longer to get back to 10 minute mark. 
But yes, I think exchanges will say "we only recognize the coin with the longest chain and highest difficulty as being Bitcoin". They could move to sell the old core coins, but again, with the lack of usability above, I doubt they'ed have much residual value.

Because, aside from the emphasis placed on them in the mantra of "decentralization", non mining nodes don't contribute particularly much value to the network.
By that, I mean - mining operations invest thousands to millions in deploying and managing their farms. That's a huge amount, and the security of the bitcoin network is dependent on them. And for that, they fight over their share of $1,404,000 ($390 * 25 * 6 * 24) per day.
A fully validating node costs, what, $80 to setup (on a Pi), or can be deployed in the cloud for a few dollars a month. If any one (or dozen, or dozens) of them disappeared, no one would even notice. That's hardly a value, and node operators should hardly expect any real level of compensation for the service. 
If the protocol was altered to reward nodes, because they're nearly costless to deploy, you'd quickly see the network swamped with them, pushing down the income for running one to less than a negligible amount. 
That's my take.

That's the thing. Lots of people came here because they disagree with the black box that is central banking. Letting one small committee dictate policy on the entire country and the world. And instead what it appears we ended up with is another black box of developers intent on pursuing a singular vision and policy despite widespread questioning and concern. 
So no. None of us expect to have a discussion with the Fed. But we did harbor the hope, perhaps mistaken, that Core would be responsive to be the needs and visions of its users. Maybe not 100% of them, but certainly working to bring people into the fold. 
Bitcoin is, after all, a lot more than just a software project like Linux, where Linus can shout this is an idiotic idea and kill an idea. It's an economic system, where we all want to transact, and therefore hope for something more than a Paypal whose source code we can inspect from time to time.

Consensus is the goal, yes. It must be, because a currency's value is proportional the the number of people using it (that being a different sort of value than the exchange price). 
Encouraging people to adopt, by consensus, a new set of rules, is not terrorizing, neither is lobbying for people to want that change, or even making available software that could effect it.

Sure, they profit off of our trades by stepping into the middle, but the other side is without them spreads would be much much wider. What are they on the Bitcoin exchanges?

Really, though, I just think it's a non starter. 
Insurance is about trust. Trust that the insured will pay their premiums is tiny, but trust that the insurer will pay out is paramount. So you have to ask, will investors flock to your platform without ample policies to choose from, and even if you do, pony up the capital to fully fund them in event a payout needs to occur? Will insureds flock to you, knowing that your costs are going to be astronomically higher, by virtue of your lack of scale?
And really, individual investors have no business trying to pick out single policies to put their money on, might as well just go to Vegas for that. 
Plus, how do you even decide when an event has occurred? When the client says so? What if the investors disagree? Sounds like investigators or courts, no?
And the entire purpose of insurance is to protect you from liability. That's the entire industry right there.

This is baffling, and this is exactly why well regarded developers keep putting forward forks for the community to decide for.
No one but no one is suggesting a radical change to the rules. No one is changing the block time, the block reward, the proof of work, the maximum amount of coins, or anything else vital to the definition of bitcoin. 
We're talking about the maximum block size, a variable that was included only as a temporary anti-spam measure, which was far, far above the amount of data in the typical block. That anti-spam measure is now being called as steadfast of a "rule" as 21 million, 10 minutes, SHA256, etc, when it never was anything of the sort. No one is trying to change the agreed upon fundamentals of bitcoin. 
And lies to miners? Where in the world are you getting that from? Miners have their own minds, and are perfectly capable of analyzing the situation for themselves.
As for your final statement, I think it's you who should be using fiat. If one simple change to the protocol is capable of decimating your faith in it, then you are the one who oughtn't be involved in what is essentially a financial system that's in "alpha" or "beta" stage.

Of course it is.
An insurance company has to be responsible first to its owners, the ones who's capital is at stake. A typical home in the US is what $200,000? And a homeowners insurance policy? Chump change. They need to provide enough push back so that people don't think the easier way to relocate is to burn their house down rather than to sell it. Or drive your car into a ditch rather than resell it. To speak nothing of harder to quantify events (does he really have pains when turning his head or does he really?)
Without protecting the companies money, any insurance company would go under in a heart beat. Given that premiums cost, rightfully, only a fraction of the insurance value. 
Yes, some operate in other ways, and their insured become their stakeholders. Even then, they're strictly passive, and the company gives them no special treatment, because, again, the moment an insurance company is known to be extra friendly to its insured, that's when it's going to go out of business. 
Not saying we're all crooks. But the few that are ruin things for everyone else. After all, if everyone were trust worthy, we wouldn't need laws or lawyers, or even a block chain. In fact, the entire reason for the blockchain is because we can't all be trusted to be honest about our holdings and who we sent how many bitcoins to.

Bitcoin is purely experimental at this point. If it takes off, then even the person that gets their first coin tomorrow will be among the earliest of adopters.

It would seem that value would come first - how valuable is a decentralized currency if its core functions don't work (proof of work through overwhelming computing power - meaning, if miners can't profit and turn off, then difficulty will drop, potentially to the extent that it could be more valuable to attack the network than participate in it).

GBTC isn't an ETF, it's a closed end fund
And bit, the fund that can confer shares to GBTC, is a privately placed fund, not for sale on the openMarket. SecondMarjet or grayscale investments or whAt not went through the filing process to create GBTC as a closed end fund to give BIT investors an alternative liquidity option, as it turns out there was a loophole in the SEC's rules allowing accredited owners of privately placed fund shares to sell those shares into the public markets after holding them for a year. 
Closed end funds, like GBTC, are different than ETF's (like COIN will be) which are different than mutual funds, public listed or privately placed (the latter is what BIT is) 
If you want an ETF, COIN is coming but we still have to wait for it. GBTC is not an ETF, and wasn't intended as such - it was basically created as an exit strategy for BIT owners, as as a means for grayscale investment to continue to collect management fees (if BIT owners redeemed their shares, those shares would go away and therefore there would be fewer assets for management to charge fees on (funds generally are charged management fees as a percentage of total assets, not a flat number to be divided among fund shares). By letting BIT owners sell into the market, they get their liquidity if they want, and management doesn't lose out on investment fees. 
It's a win-win for BIT owners and the fund manager. Incoming investors? Not so much, I don't think.

At its heart, Bitcoin is only a piece of software. Doubly so since it's open source, so anyone can fork it at any time. 
The winner in the equation will never be solely due to which is the most technologically sound, but by giving users software they want to run. Otherwise no one would run Windows in favor of Linux and neyware.  And Linux itself probably wouldn't exist but rather pure UNIX. 
Just saying. I get the urge some people have to say "the core devs are experts. Unless you're on their level you should just run the software they give you. But nothing's that cut and dried.  Uses choose the software they run. Developers need to provide that, whether it's an OS, an image editing program or a blockchain based currency.  And that's cores seeming downfall. The extreme resistance to work with users and meet in the middle. 
People talk about their expertise as if this is science. It's not. It's subjective assessments. Core thinks blocks greater than 1mb will take too long to propogate. Others think the system will be stable, that a few seconds extra won't be hugely impactful. 
Same as for node count. Core thinks that even more nodes will leave due to moderately greater resource requirements, others think that disk space isn't the reason for the node count is falling. 
We need to move away from declaring non scientific arguments scientific, and other stand that this is all opinion based. If 90% are willing to accept risk that blocks will take a little longer to propogate, then maybe that's the software thT core should provide, unless they're going to frame it as an us or them argument and risk losing their place at the steering wheel over such a small thing.

Besides, a Roth IRA does indeed distribute tax free. A traditional Ira is taxed at ordinary income rates when it distributes. In no case does an IRA distribution get taxed as capital gains.

The requirements of running a node with 1 MB blocks, as laid out on Bitcoin.org, are:
*  80 gigabytes of free disk space
* 2 gigabytes of memory (RAM)
* A broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second
* An unmetered connection, a connection with high upload limits, or a connection you regularly monitor to ensure it doesn’t exceed its upload limits. It’s common for full nodes on high-speed connections to use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month. Download usage is around 20 gigabytes a month, plus around an additional 60 gigabytes the first time you start your node.
So - 80 GB + 20 GB for blockchain storage. Should be of no impact to anyone willing to buy a hard drive.
400 kbps per month in bandwidth, which is a sliver of the average speed available in all 50 states
And the US lags behind much of the developed world in home internet speeds.
True, sub-saharan Africans will be limited in their ability to run nodes, but no one is assuming that they will do more with Bitcoin than access it through clients on their mobile phones.
So no, 1MB -&gt; 2 MB should not be the cause of significant centralization.

A blockchain can operate without a cryptocurrency.
The cryptocurrency component is necessary in Bitcoin because, well, its trying to be a currency. If a group of people or institutions determine they are okay performing the necessary proof of work to secure their blockchain for no direct compensation, that's their own prerogative. Or maybe a chain is secured by something beyond proof of work, such as proof of stake, and instead of cryptocurrency, each participant simply has a set number of "voting tokens", and no additional ones need to be created.
In short, there's lots of way for a blockchain to operate, Bitcoin isn't the only, unique, way for one to be useful.

Couldn't pick Olivier out of a crowd, nor can I think of reading anything specifically by him. 
Vapor ware does get released from time to time. So even if it arrives, thay doesn't change the fact that it's been promoted as being a fix for Bitcoin to such an extent that it's foreclosed the adoption of other scaling techniques that are available now, because Lightning will be available "some day". 
Especially ironic because Lightning is going to want bigger blocks too. But because it's been put forward as a be all end all solution, the rest of the network is getting held back because of hopes for lightning that we have no idea if they'll materialize. Not the code, but usability. And without usability, there won't be usage.
I feel like everyone's so hyped up on Lightning, people should step back for a second and ask what if it arrives, is too complicated and turns out to be a flop? What then for bitcoins scalability?

What's the point of that?
I'm just saying that that running a full node is and will be a niche activity. It's not required to utilize Bitcoin, nor should it be. 
The software you guys have written does a great job - launch it and it finds and connects to peers automatically, downloads the blockchain (quickly, too! I remember a few years ago when the 20 MB chain took days to download and validate, now its a few times larger and only takes hours).
But I can't see how you can think simplifying even more will bring more nodes into the fold. It's simple already, with next to no real burden placed on most systems running it (I say most, because I imagine some Pi's might struggle, and apparently has difficulties with his rural connection).

To insure that you're not making outlandish promises to clients. Over the phone is bad enough, over email is a written record. And if their representative, you, says something misleading, they're on the hook for it. 
Likewise, your personal holdings need to be monitored to insure you're not taking advantage of your proprietary knowledge. (We're pushing 10,000,000 shares of company X, I should preposition myself)
yes, they want to monitor your outside interests, but generally only care if you're doing something that causes conflicts of interest.
And yes, your advertising needs to be monitored because you're only a representative of the firm. You not only risk your money and your license, but risk their license and their investors money. 
And again, pre approval of speeches - you're likely not being called to speak because of who you are, you're being called because you're a broker for XXX, co. As such, anything you say can reflect upon them.

i think non-technical people can vote with their feet, knowing that there are competent professionals stewarding both code bases. 
If they happen to make a wrong decision, well, that's life. Both sides have great developers behind them, and both sides can benefit from optimizations and improvements in each others code.
And really, experience is a moot point on this particular issue. No one has experience with the real world effects of changing of block size. It's all theoretical (orphans may increase, to what extent that will actually occur is unknown, nodes may drop off), etc. 
We can look at the experience of other blockchains, like Litecoin, which generates blocks 4 times more rapidly, and doesn't seem to suffer extreme orphaning issues.
Also important, and I don't know if its been discussed, but should be apparent - the hard cap is one thing - if it's agreed that 2 MB (or, essentially, any size greater than 1 MB), a soft cap could immediately be agreed upon and implemented to keep the block size at a lower level, just as Bitcoin had a 1 MB block size limit, but a commonly enforced 750kb soft cap for a while.

No. The IRS isn't seeking to know 100% of your transactions - just like they have no idea what's going on with your cash transactions, it's largely a trust based system, where you can report whatever you want to report. Thing is, if they choose to audit you one day, this year or 3 years from now your number unluckily comes up, and they go through your records and note stuff that wasn't reported orginally, that's where you will see your self getting in trouble. Just like all your other spending - the IRS has no clue if a check a company writes is for an expense, a capital asset, a loan, or a distribution to the companies owners, it largely takes the taxpayers word for such things.
So, yes, they understand how it functions from a tax standpoint. They're saying "please report these types of transactions". It's on you to do it, and if one day you get flagged for an audit and you didn't report them and they're tracable to you, you'll have some explaining to do (not to mention some late taxes to pay along with penalties).
And Bitcoin could be dangerous in that way - all they need to do is audit, say, Coinbase which would get them a list of all the people who redeemed bitcoins for dollars through them, and then look at those peoples tax returns to see if they reported similar transactions.
So, do what you please, it's your call, as you and you alone will be the one paying the penalties if they're assessed.

It's ridiculous on many levels. 
1) the community ridiculed Mike Hearn for calling Bitcoin a failure and leaving it when his scaling exercise didn't occur. But, should others devise a method to scale Bitxoin that garners widespread support, the Core devs will apparently do the exact same thing?
2) many around here reject the notion of a benevolent dictator of Bitcoin, yet assume the current brain trust is absolutely irreplaceable. If that's the case, perhaps we should acknowledge that and give Adam and Greg the BDFL title, and declare that while Bitcoins source is available to all to inspect, it's otherwise under absolute control by a third party, in the name of decentralization. 
3) not to understate anyone's past contributions in the slightest, but I'm reasonably certain that new expertise could be found or developed in the community, if it doesn't already exist, to carry the project forward. 
4) if bitcoins future hinges on Adam and Gregory and Pieter and a couple other people, why are they not under 24/7 armed guard, not allowed to drive, or have professional food tasters to test their meals?

Insurance is not a new industry. Which means the kicks have been worked out. It's got some of the most brilliant minds out there, evaluating and pricing risk, and investing premiums carefully so as to be able to make enough knew from those investments that the rest of their business can break even or lose mined, and still grow the enterprise. 
The part you focus on, pooling investors to bid and offer insurance to one another, that's the easiest part of it. Anyone can do that. But what you specifically avoid is building a system where policy holders have any real assurance that they'll collect should they need to. Offering lower preMiums, that's nice. Until you go to make a claim, and you find that the anonymous members of your insurance pool vote against it, and being unregulated and untraceable, you can't go to courts for relief. 
likewise, the idea that payouts only occur out of the funds people have paid in premiums doesn't work - the members need to prefund the pools for the exact amount that the pool could payout, until they reach a scale that risk is distributed sufficiently. 10 people staring a pool to insure each of their own $200,000 houses would need to pre fund their pool for at least $20,000 - otherwise if a house burns down before its funded enough means the non-affected members have more incentive to leave the pool than payout. And if one house burns down, and the pool gets exhausted that would require everyone provide even more funds.
From no angle, besides the strictly theoretical, does this seem like it offers anything compelling for someone to be able to rely on when catastrophe occurs. 
Again. Get a job in insurance. Learn all about the business, not just premiums you have to pay. Because all the stuff you gloss over is the specific stuff that makes insurance a viable industry for everyone involved.

You can't just look at that one line item; your pools are gong to have to do just as much work in order to write deals at premiums that make sense, fight claims that are erroneous or fraudulent, etc. 
A pool without actuaries and competent risk asserts will either collect premiums that don't adequately cover their risks, or will end up charging premiums that no one will pay. Except for events that no sane insurer world Touch. 
Those huge expenses are a part of doing business. You can't just cut them out. If you could, the insurers would have done so already, either to boost profits, or increase share.

There's no "premium" for being able to be held in retirement accounts.  Literally everything you can buy from you brokerage "can" be held in a retirement account, doesnt mean that it is or will be. That's why GLD, IAU, FXE and the like don't trade at significant premiums over gold or the euro, despite being "able" to be held in IRA's and such. 
2 - longer term, I still expect GBTC to settle in to trading at a significant discount to NAV. 10-15% at least.
Why? Because it's a paper representation of a Bitcoin. It might be backed by Bitcoin's, but with no way to redeem it for the underlying assets, there's no reason for it to be worth as much as an actual Bitcoin. Sure, people say/said that the premium was due to people being willing to pay extra for the assurance that their coins are being held securely. True, but again, with no redemption factor, security is a moot point. They're not keeping your coins safe for you to spend at a later date, they're just holding coins that will be stuck in their system forever, while being charged a 2% management fee in perpetuity. 
To put a real number to that, yahoo reports the market cap of GBTC to be $37mm. Supposing it stays flat for a whole year, it will accrue and pay fees to it's advisor of $740,000. For what? Keeping a few slips of paper in several safety deposit boxes around the worlds?
GBTC is a uniquely horrible way to try to gain exposure to Bitcoin in your investment portfolio. If you can't buy Bitcoin's yourself for some reason, or you fear your ability to hold them safely, then the best thing to do is conclude that Bitcoin is not for you at this moment, rather than just buy GBTC because it's the only thing with Bitcoin in its name that's available. 
That, or just wait. COIN will come to market sooner or later.  And in contrast to GBTC, it will be an actual ETF, with the ability for big players (authorized participants) to arbitrage it when the price deviates too far from Bitcoin's price in either direction. Which will mean that over medium and longer periods (even over shorter periods if the AP's remain active and diligent), COINs price should accurately track the value of Bitcoin. 
Best just to wait. Either buy Bitcoin's direct, or pretend like GBTC doesn't even exist. Aside from the word "Bitcoin" in its name, it possesses no characteristics that even a die hard Bitcoin enthusiast should appreciate.

There was no block size limit in the original Satoshi client. It was added as an afterthought, at a level that the bitcoin network wouldn't see in normal activity until years later, with the guidance that that limit could be removed again though some forward thinking action (setting a block height to remove or lift the limit in clients, sufficiently far in the future that by the time it activated, even clients several generations old would adhere to the change).
So, citing one thing that part of Bitcoin originally, removed and replaced, with another feature that was there originally, capped, and which has now turned into a battle to change, not really apples to apples.

A) allowing bitcoin to accommodate more transactions per block hardly seems comparable to changing the block reward structure. That seems like a FUD-type argument.
B) and by definition (I think he misspoke when he typed it), a 50 BTC forever version of Bitcoin wouldn't be Bitcoin, as it's already deviated from the main chain (since the block reward halved some time ago), and the economic majority stayed on the chain with diminishing block rewards. 
C) Likewise, as XT and Unlimited haven't forked yet, they're essentially standard clients now. And they won't fork unless significant mining power moves to those, and miners won't change unless they see that an economic majority supports such a change.  
My opinion is too much emphasis is placed on whether a fork is "hard" or "soft". The only "advantage" a soft fork has is that old clients continue to operate, albeit in a hobbled fashion. Many prevent old clients from even being able to validate the blockchain anymore. Considering that Bitoin is still essentially in "beta", users should be expected to keep current with releases, and not expect that the community should bend over backwards to accommodate users who refuse to run current code.

For which we've already heard is extremely ill-advised.


Again, if node operators can't be bothered to upgrade, are they of any value. What if we found a critical security glitch, would we expected developers to try to fix that glitch while keeping clients on the network that would re-introduce that glitch from time to time?


Hate to beat on a dead horse here. But Satoshi did suggest a way forward. Introduce the hard fork code in current clients, but with an activation block height that should be 6 months, a year, even two years away. 
Then, as people gradually update their nodes, the code is in place to when that block height is finally reached. Put far enough into the future, one should think that the only nodes that would be left behind are ones that the operators have forgotten they're even running, which would hopefully be an extreme minority.
Point is, hard forks don't have to happen TOMORROW. And it could be done in a way that was as non-disruptive as possible. But this disagreeing on investigating any way forward is why so many of us have been cheering alternative clients.

Problem is, hardly anyone thinks about true cost. 
A year or two ago, I wondered how much it would cost to attack the network, and after a few days of researching actual production costs, came away realizing that the cost to attack Bitcoin in that way was just a small fraction of what people were thinking it was. 
Miners make money handover fist. Retail miners who buy from them don't. They pay such a high price that it's almost impossible. Not because of ill intent, just when it's a given that this $1 chip will earn a miner $10 over the next year, there's no reason for them to sell it to you for $2
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:06:41
This can be solved by applying a simple maxim. 
The valid blockchain is the longest blockchain with the most proof of work expended in its creation. If 75% or more of the miners, most exchanges, and other related platforms (like payment providers, wallet providers, etc, are all on one side of the chain it seems clear that that's THE chain. 
No one who didn't want to switch chains will have lost, they still have the same amount of coins before and after the fork.  
It's then pointless to try to get the old chain to hobble forward. It's dead. 
And it's also stupid to start a new coin with existing outputs already embedded. In the altcoin world, that's called a premine. 
So if being on what might be the longest chain with the most computational power backing it is not where you want to be, it's probably ultimately better to pack up and start a new coin from the Genesis block forward. Heck, you can even call it Bitcoin if your purpose is to cause confusion 
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:26:46
Not really.
Even if we took it at face value that that 18% are the only "true" or "legitimate" transactions, the problem with blocks being full is that these transactions get denied space in the blockchain to settle in a timely manner. And besides which, there's no real way to verify if it's true or not. 
Take me. I but a little Bitcoin every week, and every purchase goes to a new address. At some point I'll likely send them somewhere else or just return them to an exchange for cash. That transaction could have 40-50 inputs and 2 outputs. By your measure that's an "illegitimate" transaction.

*If we presume that a decentralized payment network exists and one user will make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances (assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited, and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to participate in the network with the larger blocks.*
**non-miner and miners’ consensus rules may also differ if the miners’ consensus rules are more restrictive. Non-miners may accept blocks over 1MB, while miners may have different soft-caps on block sizes. If a block size is above that cap, then that is viewed as an invalid block by other miners, but not by non-miners.**  *The miners will only build the chain on blocks which are valid according to the agreed-upon soft-cap. This permits miners to agree on raising the block size limit with- out requiring frequent hard-forks from clients, so long as the amount raised by miners does not go over the clients’ hard limit*
Seems silly.
Why haven't Adam, Greg, et al all pointed to the Lightning white paper and said "we already explained the optimal way to raise the blocksize?"
Maybe Blockstream should hire a PR person?

For years, we all scoffed at the idea of Bitcoin being digital "gold" with another coin, like Litecoin, acting as digital "silver". Til all of a sudden, we found out that's exactly what's in store. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:00:52
Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. 
GLD is an etc that owns physical gold. There was an episode on CNBC where they filmed inside their vaults. 
USO is an oil fund that does what you suggest GLD does, it holds no oil, it just buys and rolls over oil futures contracts rather than buying and storing Crude oil. But GLD owns its underlying assets. 
Here's a summary of different types of investment vehicles. Forgive typos or anything else Bc I'm typing on my phone. 
A mutual fund buys and holds stocks, bonds, or combinations thereof. They don't trade during market hours, but you have to put in buy or sell orders during market hours. Those orders execute at the end of the trading day, after the fund has had time to calculate it's Net Asset Value (NAV) per share, at the actual NAV of the fund. When buy orders outnumber sell orders, new shares are created, and when sell orders outnumber buys, shares are destroyed for lack of a better term. This means there's no set number of shares, making mutual funds "open ended funds". 
Closed end funds ("CEF"s) are created and managed by their sponsor/manager. When they're created, they issue a fixed number of shares. Those shares trade on exchanges like stocks throughout the day, and their value can deviate from their net asset values (NAV). You can generally get a quote on a CEF's NAV by adding an X to the beginning and end of its ticker symbol. To get a quote on the Credit Suisse High Yuild Bond Funds (DHY) net asset value, you can get a quote for XDHYX. 
Exchange traded funds (ETF's) are a mixture of the two- they traded on the markets throughout the day, like CEF's, but they can issue and redeem shares like mutual funds, with a caveat: only "authorized participants" can create or redeem shares- they're generally institutional entities with preexistibg arrangements with the funds, whereby they can create or redeem shares in baskets of (generally) 50,000 shares. If they want to create a basket, they deliver enough of the funds underlying assets to be equivalent to 50,000 shares to the fund provider an and are issued 50,000 shares in return. Alternatively, if they already own 50,000 shares, they can deliver those to the fund provider and receive back the underlying assets. It's by this mechanism that forces ETFs to trade relTively closely to their NAV; if the value of the shares is much higher than NAV, an authorized participant will deliver assets to the provider and sell the ETF shares into the market, capturing the difference. Likewise of an ETF trades Below NAV, the participant will buy shares of the ETF, redeem them to the underlying and sell those into the market. Almost risk free money from arbitrage. Additionally, ETFs are generally optionable (where you can buy calls, puts, etc) , where as mutual funds are not and neither are nearly all CEFs
GBTC is a closed end funds. COIN (the winklevoss ETF) is/will be an ETF. 
Thats all. Just the basic 101 stuff.

Seems like it's not suited to one-time payments, at least as its been presented to us.
To get coins from my wallet to your wallet would require:
* I'd first transfer from my wallet to lightning hub
* Assign payment to you via lightning network, paying a fee to the hub operator, of course.
* You would then request your coins from the lightning hub you're using, which would require an additional on-chain transaction
(Add a couple more steps if I was starting with fiat currency, or you were needing fiat currency, but since those steps would be the same regardless of Lightning vs Blockchain transfers, I left them out)
Unless someone is envisioning Lightning wallets, which has not been explained at all so far.

Miners are, by design, the only members of the community that can vote on issues, since they have to expend real resources to make their wishes known. User votes can be rigged. And as we now see, all the people saying "it's really only the nodes that count" caused a bunch of cloud nodes to get spun up  
You just have to accept that miners are the only actors who can vote on any issue reliably. And at the same time rest assured that they'll do everything the can to gauge the pulse of the community to insure that the coins they mine have value.

No. You don't need 100% consensus before the event. If the 75% of the network says "this is what we're doing, 28 days from now", it's reasonable to assume that during the course of those 28 days, the majority of the the remaining 25% will shift to the new thing as well.

There's nothing scientific going on here. 
It's about people determining what's acceptable. 
One group thinks that 1Mb blocks and their propagation times ahould be the most acceptable solution. 
Another group is now proposing that 2mb blocks, with resultingly slower propagation, is also acceptable. 
This is all opinion, neither claim is scientific. 
It could be scientifically stated that 1mb blocks use less disk space than 2MB blocks. That's measurable. Everything else is opinion. We need to ban the use of the word "science" in this debate because none of it is science based, it's all about different groups determining their acceptable levels of risk. Nothing more. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 22:42:25
In case you've missed the controversy, there is a lot of discontent around the current set of developers of Core. 
Thing is, no one's giving them the boot. They can keep contributing code to Core and try to make the 1MB chain stand on its own merits, or they can contribute it to Classic and just know that it's being guided by a different group of individuals.
There is nothing mutually exclusive here, and yes, the current devs have put out some neat code and interesting concepts. The thing is, there's a situation happening right now, and those concepts will run just as well on a 2MB blockchain as a 1 MB one.
SegWit could turn 2 MB blocks into 3.6 MB blocks, when its ready to deploy and activate.
Lightning could run on top of any blockchain, and side chains can be implanted off of any blockchain as well. I'm sure we'll see great things out of both of those in the future, but until then, there's a very simple code change that can be deployed right now that will fix the current situation, so long as people do what ought to be expected and keep current with their software.
This whole thing about soft forks being fine because old nodes will still recognize the blockchain is, honestly, insane. We're talking about what we hope will be a world wide financial system here, and we seem to be building it on the assumption that the people who make up the underpinnings and infrastructure can't be bothered to run the latest stable code that's deployed?
That's shocking. 
Really, every new version of Bitcoin should have a timestamp reference (or block height reference), and stop communicating with older clients after a certain cutoff date. Whether it's 3 months, 6 months, or even a year could be discussed. But it has to be expected that node operators will either keep up to date or eventually be left behind, rather than building every change in such a way as to not break any of the nodes running daemons that are years old.
Common sense.
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:17:25
Then we figure out what the most powerful node could process in 2 seconds, and say "if a transaction is more complex than this it gets dropped by all nodes" figuring if that node can't process it in a timely manner, then a little Raspberry Pi wouldn't have a chance. 
And add code that slowly raises the max complexity (presumably, total number of inputs and outputs in a single transaction) of a transaction over time. 
it wouldn't require universal deployment. If the nodes that act as front ends to mining pools included code like that, it would be enough. Un upgraded nodes would relay those invalid transactions, they wouldn't get accepted into blocks, and eventually would fall out of the mempool
@_date: 2014-06-17 13:50:08
The only differentiating factor is the pool fees. Someone mining 1 BTC a month at Ghash (with its 0% fee) would earn that same 1 BTC if they mined at Eligius (also with a 0% fee) or would get 0.99 BTC at Bitminter (with it's 1% fee), for instance. 
So right now, the "penalty" for using Bitminter is $6/month for a miner that mines 1 BTC a month. And I'll put serious money on the fact that most miners make far less than 1 BTC, meaning that their "expense" to a pool with a small fee would be even more negligible.
They're not making more money by virtue of participating in the pool that solves the most blocks.

At its heart, Bitcoin is only a piece of software. Doubly so since it's open source, so anyone can fork it at any time. 
The winner in the equation will never be solely due to which is the most technologically sound, but by giving users software they want to run. Otherwise no one would run Windows in favor of Linux and neyware.  And Linux itself probably wouldn't exist but rather pure UNIX. 
Just saying. I get the urge some people have to say "the core devs are experts. Unless you're on their level you should just run the software they give you. But nothing's that cut and dried.  Uses choose the software they run. Developers need to provide that, whether it's an OS, an image editing program or a blockchain based currency.  And that's cores seeming downfall. The extreme resistance to work with users and meet in the middle. 
People talk about their expertise as if this is science. It's not. It's subjective assessments. Core thinks blocks greater than 1mb will take too long to propogate. Others think the system will be stable, that a few seconds extra won't be hugely impactful. 
Same as for node count. Core thinks that even more nodes will leave due to moderately greater resource requirements, others think that disk space isn't the reason for the node count is falling. 
We need to move away from declaring non scientific arguments scientific, and other stand that this is all opinion based. If 90% are willing to accept risk that blocks will take a little longer to propogate, then maybe that's the software thT core should provide, unless they're going to frame it as an us or them argument and risk losing their place at the steering wheel over such a small thing.

I can understand that sentiment about a closed sourced project of much greater complexity - say Microsift losing their top 100 Windows developers. But Bitcoin is not as complex a beast, and benefits from a widely commented code base, etc. and, thankfully, the heavy lifting has already been done, thanks to the hard work of folks like Satoshi, Gavin, Pieter, Greg, and Adam (as a starting point - others have made substantial contributions as well). 
Point is, Bitcoin is already on solid footing, and could certainly survive a change in coders. Won't be seemless, nothing ever is. But let's not pretend that our project is dead in the water forever if something happened, or if many of the current leadership suddenly removed themselves from the project. 
Again, not to minimize their past contributions. They're spectacular, and because of those contributions they've built a system that can, fortunately, outlast themselves.

If you were the one i replied to originally, then it's not meant as a laugh. Everyone talks decentralization, need to keep blockchain small and how useless hosted nodes are. Seems to me that a large minority are at VPS's, and therefore not to be trusted. And it also seems that only VPS users will be alarmed at fast growth of the block chain, since they pay per gigabyte. For anyone running real hardware, it's a trivial expense. So no, I'm not joking, just like how I'm not joking when I say that if we're going to scale down the system in order to protect Pi owners who want to "contribute to the network" with their $70 investments, that it's not a real loss to lose them. 
We're talking multibillion financial system, we should expect participants to invest in it accordingly. 
As for your first thought. He started with a 20mb proposal and scaled it down due to feedback from the community. He assisted Hearn with an 8mb and growing proposal which was attacked viciously, while Garzik's 2mb proposal got widespread support around the ecosystem. True it's not a long term solution. But it serves as a something is better than nothing solution, and more importantly, should it activate, will hopefully establish that hard forks can occur again in the future. That were not forever tied to satoshis 7 year old concept without ability to improve upon it. 
2nd layer solutions would be interesting as well. But they're not here yet. And they'll run just as easily in a 2mb chain as a 1mb chain.

If you bought into any system thinking that humans are incapable of changing it, then that's a mistake on your part. 
This node vs data center argument is ludicrous. 
For one, nodes have fallen off dramatically already. The protocol doesn't support them financially, so without incentive what should you expect? And seriously, the resource requirements for running a node are minimal. We have a 70 gb block chain. 4 terabyte drives are just a hair over $100.

They get 25 BTC per block, if you didn't notice. Meanwhile a full block MIGHT have 1 BTC worth of fees in it. They're not losing anything by having 5% of each block reserved for free transactions.

The people stirring up the debate? Oh, you mean Gavin, who was chief maintainer of Bitcoin til he handed it to someone else? Sounds like a knowledgable guy to me. Better yet, is that his approach has been to educate the masses, rather than tell the masses "we're the experts. Quit trying to peek behind the curtain!"
The way the change is being conducted is due in part to the above. There's been a recognized issue that some people have been trying to draw attention to for years now, and which the dev team has been putting off dealing with, to the point that other highly regarded members of the community concluded that the two Scaling Bitcoin conferences were nothing but stalling tactics. Given that it's been talked about for years, one solution was put forward that was roundly attacked (both technologically and politically) and so forth, with next to no visible movement from the devs aside from the now usual "don't worry, we're the experts, we'll fix this at some point", it's not like a divergence is an unforeseen coup done first without any attempt at negotiation or anything else. 
Lastly. No. Core is not the define of the protocol. We are. They can put forward code, we them choose to run it. That they're the direct descendant of the original implementation doesn't mean they're the "standard", they just put out software that most people decided to use. That's how open source works.

Nodes will have to be upgraded, or else they'll be useless, with the "bonus" that since it's a soft fork, they won't know they're useless.

And again, node count isn't a be all end all solution, but it's one of several measuring sticks, just as mining XT blocks was. To attack every means of measuring consensus possible, whether mining blocks, running nodes, or bootinv people from conversations for mentioning alternatives - that's an attack against gauging consensus of every participant in the network, and should be viewed as an attack against the network, especially considering that the one of the stated goals of this experiment is a censorship resistant currency.

With bitcoins divisibility, there's no reason to adopt a lower valued coin to facilitate smaller transactions. Even if that were the case, all that would result in is a Bitcoin blockchain with slower growth in size, but a litecoin chain that's in need of the same exact fixes that Bitcoin needs.  And as someone else pontes out, if litecoin became the satisfactory solution for those high volume transactions, then there no reason it wouldn't be appropriate to act as the "gold" itself...

Blood on the street works when investing in companies - a company can be profitable but seeing investors fleeing for one reason or another, maybe that sector is out of favor, maybe there's been a dislocation and people are fleeing to perceived safety. But the financials don't lie (unless, of course, they're crooked) - an out of favor company can be unfairly beaten up ("blood on the street") and can be an eventual great purchase, and there are fundamental reasons one can look at for believing so (earnings, earnings growth, dividend, and so forth).
Buying any asset just because the price happens to be down and proclaiming its a "blood on the street" moment isn't a good idea; many times asset prices go down because they trully have become less valuable.
Is that the case with Bitcoin? Who knows. But there is a fundamental difference between Bitcoin and the shares of a company.

If 10% can withhold their agreement to implement a change in any system, you essentially end up with a tyranny of the minirity, and for every change there will always be someone who'll disagree. 
No, if that's the case, there's two options. The 90% can stay put, or they can say "fine. You can have your system your way, and we'll have our system our way."  
This whole idea that complete unanimity needs to be reached is nonsense. Majority can always do what they want. If the split is 49/51, then the majority might think twice and say "you know it's not that big a deal, and it'll split the community in half". But if it becomes extreme, then the majorities perception is that they won't lose much by going in their new direction and force the minirity to either come along or be left on their own.

No. 
Rather than anyone being able to transact with anyone else by simply signing a transaction, the vision of pushing transactions off chain will allow those clearing house to have the chance to muddle, or be legislated into muddling with, people's transactions. 
Operating a node is so far an activity that the authorities aren't trying to regulate, since the operator is a passive participant, making no money and simply relaying other people's signed messages. An off chain solution, or even a lightning hub, who knows. Well the first one would absolutely be regulatable. But even a hub, where the operator is staking their own coins, and might have to allow for user accounts, etc, that could likely be a constraint as well.

Not disclosing that your AAA rated product actually owns a whole lot of junk should also be an issue.

Because at the time he introduced it (again, as an anti-spam measure, not a transaction limited), Bitcoin had too few real world uses to be able to guess if or when enough adoption would occured to have to remove that limit in order to allow people to transact unimpeded.
Likewise, for all this talk about the need for a fee market to pay the miners with, they're all richly compensated in the form of block rewards. And even another with a halving on the horizon, they all (well, 75% give or take, based on stated support for Classic), they're compensated well enough that they can forestall the creation of a fee market prior to the next block halving.

You're wrong. 
If the system can only accommodate 7tps (actually, less than that, generally), that's 420 transactions per minute. If the economy is generating 500 transactions per minute, you need a solution other than to allow individual transactions to hop in front of line. 
After 1 minute, there will be 80 transactions in excess. After 1 block, there will be 800. If is sustainably that congested then there will be no predictability at all. 
RBF isn't a fix to improve the system. It's a fix for individual transactions to flow through a broken system.

Yes, Lightning needs larger blocks one day in the future (once its settlement transactions are sufficiently large to be filling up ordinary blocks). 
Lightings got lots of interesting features, and it sounds like it'll run on whatever size blockchain is available. But the devs have dug themselves into a hole on this one - instead of touting all of Lightnings other features, they've absolutely stood tough on the position that Lightning's primary purpose is to move transactions off the blockchain, and with that as the primary purpose, they've be beyond hesitant to work to decrease the congestion on the blockchain in any other way.
After all, if Lightning's their preferred solution to congestion, easing that congestion in another method alleviates the need for Lightning. Which is sad - again, Lightning seems like it has some great practical uses, but it's been put forward as a scaling solution first, and all the other things second instead of the other way around (i.e. "instant, extremely low-fee payments, with the side effect that only the settlements are on the blockchain").

And I never said I agreed with every setting being subject to democratic vote. Only that if he wants to leave block reward system, for example, open to discussion, that's fine by me.
Bitcoin technical, but I think that people are having a habit of overstating the technicality. For instance, in the block size debate, there are technical issues, yes, but what's being debated is opinions:
• One side thinks that block propagation times would take too long with bigger blocks, the other side thinks that the system can function even if blocks take longer to relay. 
• One side thinks that bigger blocks will lead to a precipitous drop off in nodes, the other side thinks that the drop off will be negligible, save for people who fail to or refuse to upgrade their software.
• In that light, one side thinks that having a ton of nodes on the network that can't validate transactions (which would be the case in the event of a soft fork event, like Segwit, if people didn't update their nodes), the other is thinks that the system can move forward and that people who haven't updated their software would if they risked being left behind.
The current arguments aren't about technicalities, they're about perceived and acceptable risk, whereas rethinking coin-caps, block rewards, etc, all would entail fundamentally rethinking the system as a whole.

No. Limited block size opens up an attack vector that becomes cheaper and cheaper to execute as Bitcoin becomes more popular.
If blocks were empty, an attacker would need to generate a full-blocks worth of fee-paying transactions to deny others ability to get their transactions confirmed in that block. If a 1 MB block is 95% full,  that same attacker only needs to create 50 kb of transactions to achieve the same result.
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:45:58
Well, again,people don't give away money for nothing. No one funded block stream with an expectation of getting no return.
Near as I figure, lightning will have its own fees, that users will pay rather than transaction fees to miners. So hub operators will profit at the expense of miners, while pushing for a fee market to develop, further discouraging transactions in the block chain. And certainly blockstream or their backers intend on operating these hubs.
What's really amazing about all this doublespeak is that certain people chant the decentralization mantra, is that by forcing transacting to lightning hubs, we'll lose censorship resistance (Hubs will be able to deny certain outputs from transacting in ways that nodes can't prevent ordinary coins from being spent.

Or people are just sitting back thinking they never need to upgrade because their software has continued to work.

Ultimately, it seems to come down to satoshi's oringal premise, that Bitcoin will only work if 51% of the miners aren't working to sabotage each network and each other.
Gavin's BIP seems like it provides an optional tool for well-behaving miners to use to start mining the next block, supposing that they receive a header from a miner they trust. 
Ultimately, if miners abuse that, then other miners might stop trusting their headers, and afford themselves a few seconds longer to orphan the untrusted miners block by finding a valid block and relaying their "trusted" headers to the other minders...
Gavin's BIP just gives miners a tool to make a choice.

That's what you repeatedly say, but there seem to be 100,000+ Bitcoin users, and only 5,500 full nodes, and those users seem to be transacting in Bitcoin with no problems at all.
Here's a question about node resources, since I have your attention:
Why are we not advocating for people to run pruning nodes, at all?
Seems like, once a node has downloaded and validated the blockchain, it really only needs to maintain the database of unspent outputs. Hal Finney's first transaction doesn't necessarily need to be on every node, for instance. Neither do all of the coffee shop transactions so many of us think might end up there. 
It would require that some people (perhaps the 5500 who are already running full nodes) continue running those nodes to let lighter weight nodes bootstrap themselves, but once those are bootstrapped with the full blockchain, why shouldn't they be able to simply discard transactions for which the outputs have since been zero'ed out?
That might get you more validating nodes on the network.
Which goes counter to what I've said before, which is at current hard drive prices, a 4 TB drive will probably fail before it gets filled up with transactions. But on the flip side, being a Macbook user, I'm not going to leave my computer on and connected all the time, and I'm hesitant about giving 25% of my hard drive over to Bitcoin. But if I could pop on the network, disappear when needed, then pop back on and continue (perhaps a client (probably not Core's, just because we're talking peripheral functionality) could detect if it was plugged into a power source, it would operate as a node, otherwise not.
Just an idea.
While i disagree that you must have a node to use bitcoin, and that "full-time" nodes don't face any onerous storage requirements (though bandwidth, for some, could be an issue), the state of the network, in terms of the number of active nodes that are actively validating and relaying transactions at any given time, could be improved quite a bit by focusing on that.
Just my thought.

Again, I'm going to continue the mantra that removing an anti-spam variable is far different than changing other things the do indeed change the entire nature of Bitcoin.
Changing the block size/capacity limit doesn't alter the fundamentals of Bitcoin in any huge way (though it does void older implementations), which is why various proposals have gotten such support that we've seen. Removing the cap, changing the block reward, etc, any proposal on that line would get next to no support.
And this it the time where its as "safe" as possible to make needed changes- before the unwashed masses come into the picture. If something radical or perceived to be radical needs to be done, then its far better to so now.
Besides, when the unwashed masses are using Bitcoin without knowledge of how it works, why would they even ask for changes to be made about the cap on coins or the block reward? Changing the block reward would have no impact at all on end users -  they're not mining, after all. same with changing the cap. Why would people demand a change in the maximum number of coins? It won't alter the number of coins they, themselves have.
This theory that change the block size, an anti-spam measure, starts a slippery slope to changing everything else about bitcoin is nonsensical. 
There is no official reference client.
Bitcoin Core is one implementation of the client, which preserves a legacy anti spam measure. Classic will be another implementation with removes or raises that one setting.

Can a merchant look at an address and verify that it's coming from a trust worthy source , like coinbase? 
But Even that misses something. You're putting trust in something besides the block chain. This, I feel, will burn you one day.   I recall "green coin " initiatives, where , if a coin originated from a trusted source (mt gox was used in lots if examples back then) , then the transaction could be trusted. 
Read that again. Mt gox. 
Seems to me with all these ideas about how to handle zero confirm transactions, that's pointing out a real shortcoming. Rather that sorbs energy trying to come up with ways to trust untrustworthy transactions, those concerned about it in the community should instead be lobbying Gavin, et al to shorten the block time.

You can't ignore an RBF transaction. There's no opting out of receiving any transaction - if someone knows your address, they can send Bitcoins to it, no opt in or opt out required.
Nodes can refuse to relay, but as long as some do, then those transactions will go through.
Miners just mine whats given to them. If the mempool starts dropping transactions, they have no means of knowing whether they're mining a first seen transaction or a rbf replacement.  So unless they run their own nodes, and add logic to spot the first transaction sent and ignore replacements, they're going to get through. And even if one miner does this, others might not.
And wallet software can refuse to send them, but its trivial to write and broadcast a raw transaction.
So no, I disagree with your point. Its not about if "enough" participants refuse it. If only a few participants adopt it, then that change get hoisted on all the others. There's nothing "opt-in" about it, except whether you want to opt in to sending such transactions.

Nothing you can do can prevent people from attempting to benefit from economies of scale.
But, the beauty of GPU based POW was that manufacturers were completely detached from the Bitcoin industry, and only wanted to sell their chips for as much as possible, as at great of volume as possible.
ASIC pricing has almost alway been centered on "we could make $X dollars in the next Y months if we retained this for ourselves, so we'll only sell it at a price greater than that". Which has resulted in some independent miners willing to stomach the risk that difficulty behaves as they're predicting, but mostly killed off independent mining operations - the industrial miners can see difficulty skyrocket, but when their cost of equipment if 10-20x lower than their competitors, who are their customers, this is the outcome.
General purpose hardware would solve that, if an algorithm could be chosen to defeat that - or more possibly (i'm thinking) shifting algorithms, so as to not present a static target for an ASIC designer.

If the current fee level is, say 5 cents, then the big spenders request only needs to be for 5.00001 cents or even just 6 cents, to have reasonable certainty of quick confirmation. They then would get to spend, say, 300 transactions without needing to pay a single additional fee to the miners, only to the hub operator.
So, rather than receiving 300 five cent fees over time, the miners would since a single 6 cent fee for the big spender to get their funds from their wallet to the payment hub.

I'm not going to go too conspiratorial, but are you saying that Bitcoins viability and future are tied to the hope that a core dev doesn't get sick, arrested, in an auto accident, etc? *Knocks wood*
And besides, betting is all we've got. Core is betting that their strategy will yield acceptable results, and Classic/others have wagered that Bitcoin can survive with slightly longer propagation times and an slight increase in orphaning.
I keep saying, and it needs to be repeated - we are not in the science part of the debate, we're in the risk management part, where the main issue at hand is what different camps deem to be acceptable risks.

If they can't verify a SegWit transaction, they can't verify any future transactions based on that Segwit transaction's outputs. So, it can's be *for those transactions only*, but rather *for those transactions and everything in the future*.
And yes. Banners.
I'd mentioned that or using Bitcoins alert key system (for which Gavin and Theymos both have keys, but I forget who the third holder is) to, if a hard fork occurred (in the BIP101 context), to send out alerts to nodes fell off, or risked falling off, the main chain.
The reply was basically "most nodes run as the daemon, not the QT-client. Alerts just show up in the log file, so if no one is checking the logs, they won't be aware"
Which seems, to me, stupid. Stupid in that, by preferring soft forks over hard forks, we have a system that caters to people who can't bother to update to the latest software and/or run nodes and don't bother to check the log files of those nodes.
This is, we're hoping for, a world wide financial system that we're aiming for.
A) Network operators should be expected to have to upgrade their software or be left behind
B) We shouldn't have any use for operators who don't.
A fork event, hard or soft, should be thought of as a security fix that everyone needs to apply. Yes, you can have them not activate until a certain height to give ample time for people to get ready for the changes. We can't continue to cater to those that are unwilling to apply those fixes.

No. 
When we see Amazon report sales of $29 billion and profit of $200 million, those are figures from the P&amp;L; capital investments run through the balance sheet. 
Ie - sales are a p&amp;l item
Expenses (wages, salaries, utilities, taxes) are p&amp;l items
Cost of sales (materials, products bought for resale), are p&amp;l items
Building a new distribution facility? That's a balance sheet item. 
Building or expanding a data center? Also a capital investment, runs through the balance sheet. 
That means that the slight profit that Amazon reports is prior to money's spent on capital investments, the capital investments aren't the reason for amazons low profits. 
The reasons are pretty clear: they undercut nearly everybody on price, so they have very little margin to work with. They offer things like prime, throwing around free two day shipping that they certainly have to pay for. They offer great deals across many product categories, but with such slim margins, there's no room for much profit. That Wall Street has bought it is kind of astounding. It's been nearly 20 years of analysts saying "profits are around the corner", yet, still everyone waits for them...

@_date: 2016-01-29 03:15:24
No ones talking advanced math anymore, the discussion is of acceptable risk. Many of us are fine with the risk of blocks taking longer to propogate during peak usage, rather than see transactions delayed. Miners also seem to be accepting of a greater risk of orphaning compared to the bigger potential pool of transactions to collect fees from.
If this was a talk about cryptography, I'd defer to Adam absolutely. But we're not talking that, we're talking finance and economic policy at this point, something that EVERYONE here who bashes the Fed, who bashes fiat currency and banks in general, has an opinion on and can speak to.

You're a finance guy?
Read the regs. 
Why you accept funds from l someone an interest in an entity for the hope of earning an economic return, that interest is a security and falls under the SEC's juridatiction, or an individual states if you don't reach a capitalization threshold, and/or all your investors are located in that one state. 
Doesn't matter what it is - a mutual fund, hedge fund, stock in a single company, or any other pooled vehicle holding anything that can create economic return. It becomes a security when you offer it for sale to others. You yourself, or your firm, become an investment advisor when you accept client funds to manage, whether you're investing in a broad basket of stocks or actively trading pits and calls. 
Denominating and trading in Bitcoin doesn't stop those two facts from being true, so if you're operating in the US or accepting funds from US clients, you'll need to register yourself etc.

Think about it. 
If that 1mb cap was limiting spam, then the blickchain would be 400GB in size. That it's only 60GB shows that that cap hasn't been needed at all so far; spam hasn't been an issue, it's just introduced delays in confirming legitimate transactions. 
We'd know that it was effective in blocking spam if blocks had always been full, and if every change to a "soft cap" was always immediately countered by more transactions running up to the next limit.

I guess the issue is, not knowing where things will stand, users should take possession of their coins prior to a fork to insure that they have the private keys to their coins on both sides of the fork later on.
I know the reply will be "everyone should have their own coins anyways", but that's just not the case. Tons of people use online wallets and exchanges as wallets. So if anything, this move could impress upon people that they should control their own private keys.

Your theory is that all the banks in the world want to start using the blockchain and colored coins to effect transactions, and an essay by Mike is going to derail that?
Sorry, but no. 
Many of the core devs have already made it abundantly clear that they don't want the blockchain to be used for non-transactional data. Indeed, the direction is that the blockchain won't even be used for day to day transactional data, but only for settlements.
It's not like R3 had to pay Mike to write an essay in order to get the big banks to rethink their blockchain plans and potentially whatever new concept they come up with - it's already been made clear that those sorts of transactions aren't wanted on Bitcoins Blockchain.

I'm going to go ahead and refer you to satoshis white paper. Specifically:


In other words, McNamara's fallacy is not an issue here. The system you signed up for explicitly stated that rules would be set and enforced solely by the ones creating the blocks. And it relies on at least 51% of those miners to be acting in the networks best interest, again, another explicit statement. 
We're now in a situation where it's claimed that it doesn't matter what those miners think, the rules will be set by this consensus thing that's impossible to measure, so therefore impossible to change, despite the built in mechanism for it that's been afforded Miners. 
Note: miners are the only members of the ecosystems that have made irreversible investments into it. They buy mining equipment, which (now that it's asic based) has no other value to speak of. Nodes? Either run on computers already in use, or on new ones with very little resource requirements. And holders are here by option. At any time they become dissatisfied, they can liquidate and exit. 
Unless you have a different, valid way of voting for change that's not corrupable, censorable or DDOSable, I'd say we already have our measurable voting mechanism for making changes and further optimizations to the Bitcoin protocol, and it's effectively been highjaxked  
@_date: 2016-06-05 15:21:56
Well, again, the CPI breaks things out somewhat - gasoline is a separate line item from new cars which is a separate line item from used cars. And whatever you "suspect" car lifespans, it's hard to say equivocally, since cars from 2006 have only been around for, surprise!, 10 years. But most people don't drive a car to death, rather they sell their car used to someone else and purchase a new car at predictable intervals (across the population).
As for the steak argument. 
Lets say steak was priced at $5, $6, $10, $15 and $32 per pound over 5 years. After 5 years, the bureau realizes that people are no longer eating steak in large quantities, but instead are eating burgers. That doesn't erase the 5 year build up in the CPI, but upon replacement, the index then tracks the new food. Which is, again, reflective of what people are then actually eating.
If you want to compare the cost of what was on your fathers plate to what's on your plate, that's a different measuring stick altogether. Useful? Not really for CPI (which tracks what people are actually spending their money on), but absolutely and certainly interesting, but it's definitely a different price index.
Lets take a different example a technology price index, and one line item tracks the price of mobile phones. Now, 10 years ago, flip phones like the Razr were cool, and pricey. Now they're dirt cheap. And more, most people use smart phones. So, should a current index of consumer spending show that the price of mobile phones has gone down, since we're looking at flip phones, and you want to be able to compare the cost of your dads phone to your equivalent phone today, or should it show that the price has gone up, since you don't use a flip phone, but instead have a $700 smart phone? 
I'm arguing that for whatever reason it happened, the $700 smart phone should be in the mobile phone category today, because that's more reflective of what's being purchased today, whereas you seem to be arguing that the index should forever be fixed and should contain only the price for flip phones, regardless of anything else.

You can point to aberrations like the F150 and Expedition, or unusually efficient cars from 30 years ago, but the fact is the average mileage of the fleet of cars on the road has gone up over the years.
Likewise, if steak prices got too high and people switched to hamburgers, then that is what people are now consuming, and therefore should be the new item in the price index to reflect consumer spending. Pretty simple.
And yes, if people stop eating cheddar, and kraft singles are the only cheese produced and consumed in quantity, then that absolutely should be the new measuring stick, regardless of why it happened.
@_date: 2016-06-17 13:32:47

It would take a non-trivial amount of ASICs, yes. But at the same time, it's not an unachievable amount. I'll agree, a Facebook or google couldn't be bothered to attack Bitcoin. Nor would a bank, very likely. And I doubt a government would, but only because I don't think Bitcoin will actually ever pose a threat. But a lot of people here do think that, so it's worth pondering. 
How do you think such a move would be "broadcast" to the community. Numerous organizations have black budgets, meaning there's no visibility into them. They have their own fabs, own data centers, and some of the brightest computer scientists out there. While we speculated about NSA capabilities for s long time, they only came to light, years after the fact, because one person ended up leaking documents to the press. 
Do you not think that, if they really thought it was a threat and Other measures (legal and even technological) hadn't worked, they couldn't utilize a brute force method of attack?  This is, after all an organization with a $3 trillion budget. 
How would it be telegraphed? How would the community even notice, let alone take defensive measure? We'd see lots of posts on Reddit going "woohoo! Look at the hash rate", followed by "guys, where do you think this hashing powers conning from?" to "there seems to be a problem - no matter what size fee you attach to a transaction, there doesn't seem to be a way to insure it gets into a block". Finally, it could be "guys, 90% of the network hash power disappeared. For the next 140 days, block times are going to be an hour and a half, on average". 
Again I don't even think it would happen. But only because the USG is unthreatened. 
If anything, I think ther Netscape type app has been the invention of the light wallet that allows people to control bitcoins without having to operate a node. There's a reason why Node count has fallen while usage has spiked - originally people had to run nodes to participate. But once that wasn't a requirement, they decided against it. It's not like 20Gb of blockchain storage was ok, but 60 became too much - this is a world with multi terabyte hard drives. 
It's also hard to imagine an app that would require a full node, at least one that would trigger mass adoption. What could it possibly be, that couldn't be served by a remote node? 
I'm not claiming my crystal ball is perfectly clear. I'm just saying, neither is anyone else's.

Bitcoin miners could, if they wanted, blacklist any coins they wanted, by either refusing to accept transactions from any given output or refusing to build off of blocks that contain those outputs.

I'm not saying that computers should be apart of the CPI, just that if you make a price index which is stagnant, not updating with the times as they change, it will become useless. A CPI that started at 1900 would likely include the price of horses in it. Would that be at all reflective of anything today?
And if in the future, we all are eating soylent, then that's what should be in the index, not the burgers of yesteryear. 
Again, I see what you're aiming for, but I think that's a completely different index than than what the CPI is used for.
As for I-Bonds, TIPS, etc, they're all well known to offer returns based on CPI, and the inputs to CPI are known to be adjusted as a part of reality. Nothing misleading.
If you want to invest your savings in a product that tracks CPI, then you have a product for that, that's all. No other promises are made. If you want to be assured of receiving a fixed quantity of pork or steak at some point in the future, guess what? You can buy futures contracts for that! Ok, most of them are highly leveraged, used by producers to hedge and traders to gamble, but that's not set in stone. 
GO to your local deli or butchershop. Do you think they'll be around in 20 years? Because that's your counterparty risk. Now talk to the owner, tell them you want to be assured of a steak meal 10 years from now. Can you pre-purchase your steak now and receive your steak in the future? Of course not many shops will actually do it, there's no where for them to lay off the risk, and they got into the business to sell meat, not speculate on future prices, but that's the mechanics. And that's a totally different thing that CPI based investment products.

Here you go.
Block stream raised $21 million to work on something. Obviously, investors put money in expecting a return.
Block stream's main project is Lightning Network. It's a very cool bit of technology, if you read the white paper, and it has all sorts of applicability for helping Bitcoin. Unfortunately, for whatever reason, Blockstream has opted promote Lightning as a scaling solution first, with all of its other features being ancillary.
It stands to reason, then, if Bitcoin finds a way to scale without Lightning, then that company and its investors will deem their project a failure. 
Thing is, it shouldn't be. Lightning offers cool features no matter what the block size. But apparently (and Im just judging by what I've read here, from them and others), as cool as the tech is, they assume people won't have incentive to use it unless they're forced to, both by capacity issues on the regular blockchain.
It's a shame.
And a few loud, strong voices have been able to control the conversation, so that rather than discussing merits of one proposal over another, that wasn't allowed to happen either. 
So, it's controversial because one group stands to lose (in their own mind). They shouldn't have to lose, it shouldn't be an one or the other solution, but they've decided to cast it that way.

Exactly. 
It doesn't happen around here so much anymore, but it used to be that here and bitcointalk, you'd hear constantly about people losing coins bc they "sold" them for PayPal or what not. And the most common refrain was don't sell your irreversible currency in a reversible transaction. 
Meanwhile, like you point out coinbase takes time to trust their customer. They can afford the random few hundred dollar hits. Not that they want them at all. But by starting with low limits they can limit their losses and not have to steal their customers money to break even.

We don't have LN yet. It's on the horizon. It still depends on lots of other moving parts. Wallets being adapted. Merchants accepting it. Funded payment channels between hubs to ensure routes exist between channels. User confidence in putting their coins into a channel, or giving custody of their coins to a hub with decent connectivity, and therefore Handing over their private keys. 
You can't even pretend we have LN already. It's coming, but even after it arrives, there'll be a question mark about how long it will take to be adopted.

This one jumped out at me, perhaps you could explain why this would be wanted even in an alt?
(And before continuing, i acknowledge these are just ideas you threw against the wall so to speak, and there's no indication of them coming to bitcoin):




This seems absurd to me, as it would be developers essentially deciding how long you could leave coins at a given address for. The supposed infallibility of paper wallets would disappear, as there is no real way to know whether coins are abandoned or just "at rest"
Even Satoshi's hoard - though they haven't moved, there's no way to know whether or not they're abandoned. If he doesn't want to spend them (having mined later other bitcoins later in the game that people aren't attributing to him), why should he have to move them from their original address that's apparently quite secure to a new address?
Do banks confiscate your oldest dollars if you put them in a savings account and keep adding to it, on the assumption that you've likely abandoned them since you're not accessing them?
And even in the case of "abandoned accounts" at banks, if a bank determines an account is abandoned, it transfers those funds to the state, where they can later be reclaimed by the rightful owner or a beneficiary. They don't just destroy the money or keep it for themselves (aside from, say, some banks in "neutral" countries that found themselves holding a lot of gold in the 1940's...).
So really, why would this even be on the "wishlist", so to speak?

You know the whole "censorship resistant" thing? How does that jive with "as long as participants cooperate"? Your hub operator could refuse (in theory) to let you spend your coins; in general or to a particular address. 
And to say that you can spend to any participant, that's supposing that all Huns have a path to one another. Maybe that'll be so. Or maybe there will be two ecosystems of hubs, the KYC compliant hubs and all the others.  
These 4 bullet point VASTLY understate the complexity of lightning and just echo the hype. We need discussion on the whole picture, not just concentrating on the good (or the bad). But I would give more creadance to the naysayers only because nothing ever works out as originally planned. So what are the alternate scenarios?

If the majority of miners drop off suddenly, it doesnt' guarantee any results to the remaining ones at least in the short term. The difficulty doesn't drop immediately in reaction to a drop off in hashing power. Depending where we are in the cycle, a difficulty adjustment could be two weeks out. And say 95% of miners switched to something else, that could put the first difficulty adjustment 20 WEEKS away. And it might need several adjustments to get to the expected 10 minute blocks and 2 week difficulty adjustments.
Now, given that, do you really think that even 5% would stay?
@_date: 2016-12-21 00:03:37
If you took $100 of your 1920 dollars and put it in savings account with an average 5% interest rate (seems weird now, but plenty of time in years prior where rates were far higher), you'd nearly $15000 2016 dollars.
With that you could purchase 10 ounces of gold and have money left over.

@_date: 2015-08-10 21:35:05
at the risk of betraying my allegiance (I tried to objectively state the sides), simply "yes". 
When I first heard of Bitcoin, I ran a full node because I had to.  That was the only option. Same for everyone else. Now there are more efficient ways of handling Bitcoin, such as electrum, etc. So it's not necessary to run a full node simply to receive and spend bitcoins.
It's great that a node will run on something as underpowered as a Pi, it really is. But I think that node operators who want to help Bitcoin should do so by providing ample hardware, storage and bandwidth, not by holding the rest of the network back by demanding that whatever arbitrarily constrained hardware or setup they have should be able to be a member. Not accusing you, and a Pi's ARM Seems plenty fast enough. But there are people trying to run nodes  and services over capped 4G cellular connections, for example. 
But yeah, I think the node drop is simply because the Core wallet is no longer the only wallet. Other clients exist that provide better features, a side effect of that being that they don't run as full nodes anymore. Increasing storage requirements may push a few more people to pull the plug, but really, if they're pulling the plug because their hatd drive is filling up because people are actually transacting, can the even be viewed as supporting the network at all?

When we popped open the driver side, it was immediate clear there wasn't a way i was going to get to drive it.

The pro's seem to believe:
• The current 1MB block limit is was an artificial construct in earlier times
• That the excess capacity of the network is diminishing
• Transactions should be low-cost, but increasing the block size will increase the number of fee-paying transactions, via increased activity
• Everyone should be able to transact on the blockchain
• Available network bandwidth and storage costs will likely scale at a rate greater than any of the proposed rates of block size increase
The against the block size increase say that
• Increasing the block size will increase propagation times, which could potentially allow one miner to have an advantage over others (specifically, the miner who solved a block could have a headstart over miners)
• Transacting on the blockchain itself should be discouraged, in favor of Lightning, Sidechains or Altcoins, at least for "small" purchases. 
• Increasing the block size will reduce the need to include fees, which, as the block awards diminish, will deincentivize miners from securing the network
• Increasing the block size will increase the bandwidth and storage requirements, making it impractical to run full-nodes
• There is no guarantee that network speeds (via the public internet) and the cost of storage will continue to decline at fast enough rates into the future.
That's my TL/DR after reading though months and months of debate.

It's a Linux box. Have a VM running windows 7 acting as an iTunes server for a few apple TV's.

Some significant holder of Bitcoin gets spooked that Peercoin is gaining traction, which would hurt their Bitcoin investment. They begin buying up slowly, intent on acquiring 51% of the currency in order to prevent people from transacting. Yes, their "investment" in Peercoin is lost, but their much larger investment in Bitcoin is safe. 
More theoretical:
The U.S. And Chibese governments are freakinvout that their citizens are switching to Bitcoin en mass. They collectively build and deploy their own fleet of miners intent on building a longer chain and preventing the majority of transactions. Again, the money sunk into mining is lost, but their existing financial systems and order remain preserved.

Problem there is that there is so much fraud in the gift card space. Gift cards that are sold are so often acquired with fraudulent credit card info, which means that cards that are purchased are often bought with fraudulent info. And merchants have so little recourse - if someone buys with a credit card and charges back, they can argue their case to the merchant, either showing signed receipts, footage of the customer, etc. if someone buys a gift card with a stolen cc, the credit card holder might not know for a month, and by then the gift card will be depleted. The merchant knows who depleted the card but how can they prove that person knew the card was obtained via fraudulent means?
Just saying, outside of giftcards and porn, much of commerce via credit card is indeed frictionless.

• what benefit do they provide to decentralization? Seems like nodes not attached to miners just add more steps that a transaction has to take before it reaches a miner who will include it in a block. And lately, it seems like theres an added risk that some nodes might refuse to relay some transactions if they feel they are spam.
• explain their benefit to SPV/light wallet users. Electrum wallets don't pull their data from random nodes, they get it from specialized servers running electrons server software.
• What exactly is validating a transaction? A transaction is valid if it is included within a block, which then has more blocks built upon it. If you're relying on zero confirms, the transactions you're looking at aren't yet valid transactions.
• AGain, explain. How are 10,000 unknown nodes and operators more resistant to attacks against, say 30 well known and trusted nodes. Who is to say that 5100 of those unknown nodes are actually operated by someone with unknown future nefarious goals?
likewise, how do more nodes prevent monitoring?
• How does a node provide their owner with their own private bank? Their transactions are stored on the blockchain just like anyone elses, whether they operate a full node or not.
• And 99.99+% of people likely will have no use for having the blockchain at their fingertips. I hadn't run a full node in a few years. Just started one again, out of sheer boredom... Will be upgrading to XT, just because.... Still keeping coins in my electrum wallet, though.

Occam's Razor would say that he hasn't had a need to move them. 
Why should he have? Obviously he made a living before inventing bitcoin. Just because you'd exchange them all so that you could roll on a bed composed of millions or billions of dollar bills, and failing to be able to do that, you'd erase your private keys, doesn't at all suppose someone else would do the same.
Plenty of reasons not touch them. Maybe he doesn't do drugs, so he had no interest in silk road. Maybe he has plenty of fiat currency, never needed to exchange them. And so forth. But to assume the keys were deleted without any proof, or even statement to that effect (and, even if he made such a statement, we'd all be right to question the veracity of it), that's a huge leap of faith.

Except for today's unique times, interest rates have generally exceeded the rate of inflation. And banks don't just "promise" to pay you interest - the DO pay it. How do they pay it? Loaning it out to other people, collecting interest on that loan and giving you a slice of that. Nothing big. Nothing complicated. Nothing conspiratorial. 
It's absolutely silly that everyone here goes on about the loss of purchasing power to inflation, yet ignores the simplest remedy to that problem - leaving your funds in an interest bearing account, where you'll out earn inflation and wind up with more and more purchasing power over time.

The first group weren't the "I'll host it if it causes me no convienence whatsoever" group, they were the "I'm interested in Bitcoin but the only way I can have a wallet is by being a node". Then better, easier to use wallets came along. Electrum for one, which enables you to back up your wallet on paper, by writing 12 words down.  Tell me you don't prefer that system to backing up your wallet.dat, worrying that your change or new coins will arrive to addresses you haven't generated in your wallet yet, or just the worry that your backup media goes bad, gets stolen, etc. 
That's why node count went down. Plain and simple.

You misunderstand tax reporting and the IRS role in that. They don't need to "prove" anything. They need to look at your bank records and say "what is that deposit From coinbase? Can you explain why it's not on your tax return?"
As much as they might want to audit individual Bitcoin/altcoin transactions, unless exchanges are filing 1099's, they'll have no visibility there, but they will have tremendous visibility insofar as where Bitcoin is exchanged for fiat within the U.S. Banking system. 
So no, if they come knocking, they'll have total disinterest in your private keys. They'll have huge interest in transfers in and out of your bank from Bitcoin exchanges though.

You buy up the POS coin in order to make it useless to everyone else, pushing them to the coin you want. Or you blow up Bitcoin and stave off any threat to fiat currency. 
Simple, both are worth doing if the benefit (the insurance payout, the benefit to Bitcoin, or the benefit to fiat) is greater than the cost (the actual replacement value of the house, the cost to buy 51% of the POS coin, the cost to deploy greater than 100% of the hashing power that legit miners can likely bring online)

We've got one solution that will work just fine, based on the technology as it was invented, with broad support from miners, wallets, exchanges.
And we've got two other proposed solutions which aren't even in alpha testing phase...
Everyone that keeps saying "we shouldn't do anything, there's a lot of peoples money at stake here" seem to forget that doing nothing will likely be more detrimental in the long term. We shouldn't want to wait until the network is having reliability problems to devise a solution...
Sad thing is, if those two other solutions turn out to be superior, they'll be just as usable with a blockchain that supports bigger blocks as they are with smaller blocks. There is literally no downside to them, except that larger blocks mean there will be less demand for their theorized solutions...

If they want to accept customers from New York, and have access to the financial system (be able to transfer funds to, and receive funds from) those customers bank accounts, then New York regs become very important. It'd be one thing if they were just a vendor, accept funds and ship product. It's another to interface with the financial system the way exchanges and their customers would like them to... For that you can't say "I'm out of your jurisdiction, your laws are meaningless" because the regulators will say "these banks are in our jurisdiction and they will comply with our request that they not accept funds from, or send accounts to, accounts associated with you"

Well, a half-penny from 1792 is currently worth $99 on eBay...
But more to your point, yes, people who put cash under their mattress lose out to inflation. Obviously. People who put cash into a savings account generally don't. The value of their initial dollar decreases, yes, but the flip side is they earn more and more dollars as time goes by.
1 dollar saved for 200 years at...
... 1% interest will turn into $7.32
... 2% interest will turn into $52.48
... 3% interest will turn into $369.36
... 4% interest will turn into $2,550.75
... 5% interest will turn into $17,292.58
... 6% interest will turn into 115,125.90
And so forth.
According to link -  (adjusted to 200 years) - your $1 in 1815 would have $15.90 in purchasing power today (according to the CPIU).
Considering that since 1790, interest rates have only been at this baseline level for 10 or 15 years (during WW II and now), and generally much higher, one would have done FAR better saving a single dollar over 200 years than to have sequestered that dollar away into some unit of constant purchasing power.

Selling products is distinctly different than providing financial services, which is what Bitcoin exchanges do in the eyes of the law. And in that case, they need to comply with all sorts of additional regs. 
A New York financial firm soliciting Georgia residents? It becomes both states business. What if more than a handful of those Georgians happen to be on a business trip to Tennessee at the time that they're executing their subscriptions? All of a sudden, Tennessee has a potential interest too. 
Note that normally, the regulators of Georgia and Tennessee will have no knowledge of this transaction, but the New York firm will still want to be sure of their compliance with each states regs, because if a year or two later a customer lodges a complaint, that will all come to light

Use escrow. Then have to trust the escrow provider to not abscond or get hacked. And pay a fee, meaning if prices are the same across the board, you'd pay more paying with Bitcoin than a credit card. 
We really over estimate the risk of charge backs around here. If chargeback were such a risk, merchants wouldn't accept credit cards. They do though, by and large. Most consumers are honest, though there are plenty of examples of fraudsters taking money from those honest people, which is why disputing and charging back are even options...
So no, it's not stupid. If you think it is, step back a bit. 
We have a trust less currency. We're afraid to spend it directly and therefore need escrow. Which we then need to trust. How's that worked for all the darknet buyers and sellers who've seen their escrow balances vaporize?

And with being an early adopter comes risk as well as reward; we want the masses to join us, that'll surely drive up the price of Bitcoin. Along with that though, that'll mean that there'll be even more at stake. Instead of $4 billion, there could be $40 or even $400 billion at stake then. Is that the time to start fine-tuning things? No, now is the time. Whatever dislocations happen, we can get through, without doubt.

Protest of what?
Is Bitcoin singled out? Absolutely not. 
Any firm that takes possession of another persons funds needs to register with the state, if not the fed, and comply with many layers of rules.
Investment Advisors with custody of funds or who have full power of attorney over accounts (meaning they can withdraw clients cash) need to.
Brokerage firms, banks, attorneys, CPA's, and the like, if one person holds another persons money and can theoretically abscond with it or divert it elsewhere, then the States and Fed are keen to see that they are Registered, properly capitalized, and that people with access to those funds are known.
Bitfinex "cutting off" NY customers doesn't help - it's only a matter of time before other states do the same, just as they do for all the other above mentioned entities. Likewise, fleeing Bitstamp because they choose to comply also is meaningless, if anything you're fleeing to a company (any company that chooses not to comply in NY), that will likely end up stopping offering services in your state once regulators get up to speed.
Sure, this onerous, but this is what any other business in this classification has to do. Start a hedge fund? You're filling out pretty much an identical level of paperwork, supplying fingerprints and everything else. 
People need to start seeing the bigger picture. Bit license isn't singling out Bitcoin companies to do anything more than any other comparable financial services firm does, and whether you believe it or not, exchanges are financial services firm according to the business model. 
But sure. Stop doing businesses with the exchanges that do comply, and only do business with the firms that shut down in states that ask them to follow the rules. Lets see how many are left, at least to service US customers in an while completely unregulated, in a year or two...

I upvoted you, but at the same time, with the market caps of coins being what they are, it's trivial for any of the coins perceived enemies to invest in ways to undermine them. A big player buying up POS coins in order to stop transactions on that chain. An organization deploying mining hardware only to mess with the blockchain.... It's not without precedent, Luke-jr used his pool to attack other blockchains at one time. Nothing out there to prevent the U.S. Or Chibese givernment, let alone a central bank or Wall Street bank from doing the same, which would be akin to investing capital to destroy competition. 
So to say that it would make no sense for someone to make that sort of investment only to bring down the crypto of their choice, that seems rational enough if you're thinking that that would be the extent of ones investments, but if you step back and see a bigger picture, it's easy to imagine a scenario where one would want to invest their money solely to undermine something, so long as they owned something else that would benefit more from the destruction of the competitor than from investing that cash into their own business....
Make sense?
But no, I don't think for a minute any government or bank would actually attack that way. Really, contrary to many here, I doubt governments and banks pay much attention to to this space at all. It's positively tiny, and likely won't ever be a real threat.

With a total market cap of what, $4 billion, which includes a billion of coins that probably have never moved, you have to think the overlap is slight.

Onto the site, yes. Able to search for local sellers in New York? No. 
And, if bitlicense is analogous to the laws other licensed, registered financial service firms have to follow, all it could potentially take is for a New York regulator to arrange to buy coins via bank deposit from someone in New Jersey, California, or anywhere else:
"you accepted the deposit and sent coins? You just did business in New York. You didnt ask for ID or any thing to establish that your customer wasn't from New York? Not our problem"

Because as sound as you think it is, the rest of the world views Bitcoin as an extremely speculative investment.

To some extent? Is that like one colored coin per company, with each having their own side chain?
But more seriously, my understanding of colored coins in general is that they can be represented by tiny fractions of a Bitcoin. How will miners treat these transactions which could be considered "dust", if not "spam" or an "attack". Likewise, if blocjsuze doesn't increase in order to foment a fee market place, wouldn't transactions on the block chain be hugely more expensive than their present zero cost? Or the attendant risk that trades simply don't go through if others are transacting with bigger fees?
None of that to knock the concept you laid out, but all of a sudden it seems like all these alternative block chain uses could have a wrench thrown in their spokes due to the blocksize cap battle...

besides the fact that
A) it would be the longest chain

people keep saying "miners don't matter", yet for the last many years, everyone has been applauding as the hash rate has gone up because that has apparently meant the network is that much more secure... Seems to me that miners matter a whole lot more than nodes, where anyone can spin one up for minimal cost, compared to the huge outlays that miners have to make regularly to remain competitive.

Why does everyone seem to think that XT is a permanent, fixed solution? There's a soft cap in place today, why wouldn't that be the case with XT, only rising when miners feel comfortable, not just because the hardcap increased? And if centralization occurs at any greater scale than its already heading towards, it's likely the community could do something then. Unless it's a paralysis type situation liken now and the bulk of devs say " well we're not too centralized yet, let's wait til it's actually a problem"

How do regulated Bitcoin exchanges prevent the case of a merchant not providing the good or service after you paid them?
every escrow deal I've seen, buyer pays escrow. So buyer pays 101% of item price and merchant gets 100%, whereas with card, buyer pays 100% of list price and merchant gets 98% of that. Read: it's cheaper to pay with a card  
Then there's centralized escrow risk, which could apply to anyone who holds your money for you - the risk the escrow agent themselves take the money. Again, look to the dark web for many examples of that occurring. 
And back to the beginning of your comment; you're basically applauding government regulation of the space? Acknowledging this can't work without big brother?
I urge you to take off your rosy sunglasses. Not saying that Bitcoin is hopeless, but we need to be honest about the attendant risks. As well as benefits. 
Why should I tell someone "get Bitcoin and buy your stuff with that? You'll likely pay a fee or difference on the spread to get it from an exchange. If you want to be safe spending it, you need to trust someone else to hold it when you order stuff. You'll likely pay more than with a credit card. If you don't escrow you'll have little recourse. Oh, but it undermines government and big banks, that's cool, right? Except we need government to regulate exchanges to make us safer?" 
Is that the selling point?

Every company's margins are greater than the bare minimum. Western union charges $30 because they can, not because they have to. Microsoft charges hundreds for a windows license because they can, not because they have to. Apple charges hundreds for their products because they can, not because they have to. Why western union the only unethical company, simply because they could slide on their price?
Think about it. What are western unions costs to transfer funds? Zero. They accept funds at one location, and disburse from another location from that locations cash on hand. Occasionally they'll need to settle up balances, but they can do that by check, ACH for free, or via wire and pay $10 or $20, which is to settle up for all the transactions at a given location, not for a single transaction. 
Yeah, it'd be close to free (currently) to send bitcoins, but she would incur fees here acquiring them, and likely much greater fees there when the recipient tries to sell them (if there's a market at all)
All this demonstrates is that WU isn't going anywhere anytime soon. They have huge margins and can absolutely lower their prices should Bitcoin pose a serious risk.

Well, if BIP101 had been integrated into core, we wouldn't have this fiasco either, and nothing about the bkickchain would have changed unless 75% of the miners agreed...failing that, miners and node operators simply have a choice. And, if on the last day, when it's clear that a fork is coming, because the majority of miners, nodes, and businesses are all advertising support for it, Core can still come out unscathed by simply going along with the wishes of the community.

Real world usage is separate from arbitrary caps. Yes, usage can't exceed the cap, but there's no guarantee that it'll reach the cap either. Maybe Bitcoin only grows to the point that blocks consistently have 20MB of transactions - even if the cap at that point were 200MB, each block would still only be 20MB. But there would be a ton of capacity to spare should it ever be needed. 
That's part of the debate that loses me - if transaction growth doesn't max out blocks, then these doomsday scenArios about atorage requirements can go away. And if transaction growth does occur and blocks are full at whatever size, holy shit! That means that Bitcoin is popular and used all over!  All these "to the mooners" talk about that like it would be a bad thing!

I feel like node operators, if they truly want to support Bitcoin, should have no problem shelling out a little more per month for a step up in their VPS' storage... Or maybe they'll need a new SD card for their Pi... It's not like larger potential blocks preclude other things like lightning.network and sidechains, people could transact on those if/when they become realities.

The code is open source, but fork the code and you no longer have Bitcoin, at least as recognized by anyone else. Meanwhile, whatever the "core" team does will be adopted by default by many, many users, will be linked to here and on vitcointalk, etc. seems official to me. 
This whole "contentious" thing is silly. Changing the maximum amount of coins, the block reward or the hashing algorithm, those would be changes that fundamentally alter Bitcoin and "should" be considered contentious in my eyes. Introducing a mechanism that minimally alters how Bitcoin works in order to increase its capacity and throughout, albeit via a hard fork to the block chain, that doesn't seem like it should be considered contentious at all. Just growth. Was the decision to move windows from a 16 bit code base to a 32 bit one labelled viewed as contentious or as progress? Apples move from their ancient OS to OSX would likely more qualify, but controversial as it was at the time to effectively let everyone know that OS 9 applications' days were numbered and therefore force Mac developers to learn a new set of tools, im sure in hindsight everyone will agree was the correct option. And that's far more jarring than simply supporting a larger blocksize at a time far enough down the road that the only people who would be left off the blockchain when it forked would be those who consciously ignored the fact that change was coming.

so you're saying those of us who don't know C or C++ ought to just use PayPal then, as our opinion of Bitcoin "policy" is just as irrelevant as our opinion of PayPal policy? Or perhaps there's enough coders already, and some need to step outside their tower and see what users (the ones that create all the value on/of the blockchain) think? And if those users disagree, then obviously it's because a developer slanted the argument by taking his case to the users, or else let's raise a bounty and try to figure out what users could be sock puppets, because obviously no user should want greater than 1mb blocks for some reason?
Also amusing about that sock puppet thing was I was named as either being a sock puppet or having one I forget which, but is never heard of that user til that "study"...
No bitcoins got plenty of developers. Just too many are intent on pushing their own view of what they want Bitcoin to become rather than adhere to the vision that was laid out and what we all signed up for.

Yes, with a single caveat, which would be if you do so regularly you'd need to meet the requirements set forth by the SEC to be a "pattern day trader", which specifically is capital of at least $25,000 in your account. Which makes sense, even with that little commissions would kill you if you were rapidly trading. 
Here's the definition of pattern day trader from Wikipedia:
*Pattern day trader is a term defined by FINRA to describe a stock market trader who executes 4 (or more) day trades in 5 business days in a margin account, provided the number of day trades are more than six percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day period.*
Here's one brokerages explanation for trading on unsettled cash:
You may also trade in a margin account with your own cash. No extra interest or fees will be charged if you do not borrow money from Firstrade or exceed your cash buying power. **Trading in a margin account would allow you to use unsettled funds; this will avoid all the settlement date related violations that could happen in a cash account.**
Ref: 
Settlement date violations, from the above, are known as "free riding", which refers to the purchase of stock using unsettled funds from a previous sale. Here's the page on Wikipedia about that:
Note where it says: *Freeriding can be avoided by using a margin account.*

Seems logical that a fee market will develop when it's actually needed, and by needed I mean for mining to remain profitable. Right now, fees aren't needed so miners scoop up every transaction out there. As rewards decrease, we'll likely see pools start setting thresholds for what they will or won't include. Sure, some smaller players might continue processing all transactions, but if they only have say 1% of hash power, that'd mean that zero fee transactions would have a 1 in 100 chance of making into a block, and only if that pool only includes zero or low fee transactions... If they only reserve 50% of block space than that could fall to 1 in 200. Most rational users will opt to pay the fee, rather than wait 200 blocks (over a day) to know that their transaction has processed.
theres a few people who seem too concerned with creating a fee market now. Makes no sense - that's exactly what block awards are for. As those disappear it seems logical that miners will set policy to remain profitable, rather than mine at sustained losses. The best way to insure their future profitability is to encourage people to transact on the blockchain, not to limit space and create more "artificial scarcity", nor to plot methods to increase fees now when they're clearly not needed. The only thing that should be "scarce" are bitcoins themselves, but when people have them transacting should hopefully be as frictionless as possible....

While I think you're spot on about mining, and no, I'm not advocating for lifting the cap, I think vendors will go with where they see the best value and liquidity. If early adopters own and horde all the coin (and trust me, even if the current early adopters aren't the final beneficiaries, there will be others - wealth trickles up, not down), then one could easily see customers and vendors clamoring for a system where people are more likely to transact. I think there's hope in the 21 million limit, but mostly if it remains a system of interchange between fiats, if Bitcoin became the global reserve then I have almost no doubt that things wouldn't go smoothly at all - the vast majority of coins would end up in savings with the remainder growing smaller and smaller.

You misunderstand tax reporting and the IRS role in that. They don't need to "prove" anything. They need to look at your bank records and say "what is that deposit From coinbase? Can you explain why it's not on your tax return?"
As much as they might want to audit individual Bitcoin/altcoin transactions, unless exchanges are filing 1099's, they'll have no visibility there, but they will have tremendous visibility insofar as where Bitcoin is exchanged for fiat within the U.S. Banking system.

It's due to the extreme libertarianism here. People hate the government and its onerous regulations because that's what cool around here, and fail to see that the reason regulations are imposed is because it's been found they've been needed; there are regulations of entities that hold other people's funds because before then people easily stole those funds. They still can, but there are defined penalties, as well as a defined chain of responsibility. Compare how many regulated mutual funds see their clients money vaporize compared to the unregulated/hedge fund (Bernie madoff) space. 
Likewise, there are regulations on the amount of air and water pollution companies are allowed, because it's been found that without them, the companies won't care. Look at urban China today, for example. 
And there are regulations and securities laws, not to punish people like Eric Vorhees for coming up with an innovative ideas, but to attempt to prevent the fleecing of the public will sham and shell companies galore. The FTC couldn't stop Butterfly Labs but it could try to hold them to account, disgorge or punish their principals after the fact, just as Japan is now bringing Karpeles to account. 
Regulations are costs imposed on businesses in order to try to protect customers. Plain and simple.  
Last example, air traffic. How would people feel flying, if we had no idea if each carriers planes were not maintained to at least a certain minimum standard? Yes, that coats airline a lot more than it would to just fly their planes till they disintegrated, and those costs are passed on to us without doubt, but at the same time, it's turned air travel into a commodity rather than a life or death gamble. Really. Go to some of the poorer Asian or South American countries and look at their planes...
I just think it's time we get with the times. We want Bitcoin to grow up, go "to the moon", and have to accept that not only is some regulation possible, it's also necessary, and would end up being a net benefit to the system as a whole.

To me, that resonates like garzik's accusation that the first two scaling Bitcoin conferences were just for show, to stop the community from investigating options thinking that core was on board. 
Now, when Core drags its feet and people look to other options, people will say "why? Adam back, Blockstreams owner, signed the consensus document. It'll come, just be patient", and when people ask where the changes are, the refrain can be "Adam just signed as an individual, blockstream made no such commitment"

Short of implementing proof of stake, proof of work is the only real way to get valid votes out of the ecosystem. Add on a little business acumen - miners won't mine blocks that are awarded coins they can't sell to cover expenses and return profit, it seems like a pretty reliable mechanism. Node counts seem bogus, nothing to stop someone from spinning up a ton of pseudo nodes to declare support one way or another, or using something like NotXT to poison the voting pool. Miners invested significant cash, and expend significant amounts of computing power, two things that can't be spoofed.

Clearly, soft-forks only can't bring everything that's needed, if the intent is to forever be compatible with the original satoshi client. We can add new rules with softforks, but we can't alter or amend existing rules without occasional hard forks.


Satoshi already laid out a pretty easy solution to all of this years ago - include code in the base distribution that won't activate until years later, so that by the time the activation event occurs, that code is already in clients several generations old. 


What are you talking about? Again, miner's won't act unilaterally - they'll act when they know that people will assign value to the coins they make. Thats the voting mechanism and market forces right there, no government needed.


I'm not saying that POS could prevent a hard fork. I'm saying that short of POW, POS is the only other mechanism to reliably attempt to gauge support for protocol changes. Counting nodes is useless, due to PseudoNode, NotXT, etc. POS seems to be the only solution, aside from just ceding to the Core developers and having accusations of betrayal launched against them.

Bandwidth is growing by leaps and bounds. In the US, we're lagging, but this isn't a US centric system. And china is behind its firewall.
Even so, Bitcoin is only using a fraction of available resources. A one time increase, or several limited increases, wouldn't suddenly increase the requirements to run a node in any sort of extreme way. People in very limited areas like Luke-Jr might feel strain, but i think that striving to build to the lowest common denominator will be just as dangerous in holding Bitcoin back from wider use cases.

Concentration of mining power will exist regardless of pools or not. China has much cheaper power, and is logistically advantageous because that's where most ASIC's are manufactured as well.

There is no correct answer.
Halving doesn't occur on a set date, it occurs at a set block height. There are various way to guesstimate when that will occur. 
* You could just take the current block number, subtract that from 420,000, and multiply the number of blocks by 10 minutes (the target block time). That will get you one date.
* You could do the same as above, but instead of 10 minutes, multiply it by the average block time of the last 100, or 1,000 blocks, which will all be less than 10 minutes due to the continued deployment of new hashing hardware.
Either answer could be correct, but they're both estimates that will get adjusted and become more and more accurate as we approach block 420,000

It won't be the banks forcing a change. It'll come when miners effect the change, which they'll only do if they know that the coins they generate will have a market to be sold on at a value that they can profit from.

This is why node count for either side is an almost useless metric. 
The minimal cost to deploy a node, whether Core, Classic, XT or anything else, means that people can attempt to "vote" whether for or against by only running a node at next to no cost. The Core devs acknowledge that there are likely many abandoned nodes at this point, whose owners haven't updated in some time, and likey won't update regardless. 
Meanwhile, hash power, as Satoshi designed it, is a means of getting an accurate count of one segment of the community, the only segment that can be polled. When they're voting, it's not a Sybil attack, its an actual deployment of resources and expenditure of electricity. 
And to state the obvious, again, miners won't act independently. If Classic gets 75% of the hash power and no exchanges will accept Classic coins, and no one in the community will either, they won't switch to Classic just because they got the requisite hashing power.  That other segments are in favor, though, helps them gauge interest so that if 75% is reached, they'll know whether or not to update their policies to actually generate BIP100 blocks or not.

It's one thing for a small business to make a few people redo their work - they can tell themselves "we'd pay them anyways, that's makes more sense than paying this extra money"
A hospital though? Hundreds or thousands of employees, tons of patients, test results, etc. and probably most is backed up as of the prior day. But in that case, the people who control the purse strings, and likely the doctors and everyone else, determined that paying $17k was the most cost effective solution. 
Imagine the outcry if they lost, say, that day's lab results were lost, they either have to redo them from existing samples or call patients to come in and redo their labs. Worse, imagine one was needed for an immediate diagnosis, and that patient died. Can you not imagine that the hospital would be opening itself to much larger liability?

This is malarky. Which i think is a funny word, but true none the less.

No ignorance here, sorry.
You're right - Bitcoin doesn't exist in a technological vacuum - it stands to benefit from technological benefits just like everything else in the tech world. And that includes faster and faster CPU's, and cheaper and cheaper storage.
The price of computing resources and storage continues to plummet - if you're saying nodes won't be able to host the blockchain if the block size goes up, then I'll just say maybe the requirement to run a Node should be more than a Pi with a flash card. 
And likewise - I'm not saying that bigger blocks are the ONLY scaling solution, but I am saying that Lightning has benefits to the user regardless of block size - if i were presented as a higher level layer that people could opt into (say, for lower fee transactions, instant, confirmation less payments, perhaps enhanced anonymity, etc), then I would cheer for it. But that Bitcoin itself is being held back so that Lightning becomes the defacto, only solution - that's where I find issue.

Those are absurd arguments. You have to assume that the participants in the system aren't going to break it just for the sake of breaking it.
If a pool has 51% hash power, they could:
Be benevolent - they're earning 51% of the networks income after all, why screw with it?
Be opportunistic - they're earning 51% of the income, why not try to get a little more through some opportunistic double spends?
Break it? Refuse to build off of others blocks, knowing that your chain will win out and overtake the others. Change the rules. Give yourself all the rewards. Increase those rewards, too.
Now, the question is, which system are we going to find value from?
A) A network with a big player who plays honestly?

Where is it?
For months we've been told that miners don't matter, individual users don't matter (even vast 
majorities, apparently), it's only either the "full economy", "Core", or "node operators", but there so far haven't been any steps taken to quantify how to measure anything but mined blocks.
I'm usually not a fan for MP, specifically for taking as extreme positions as he does. But I will applaud him for this, simply because it's proposed a partial solution to this conundrum. Maybe not, as you say, a valid solution, but at least one that was flawed enough for you to say, as you said, "it's time to investigate valid schemes" to do this.
However, that tone you take previous to that concession, seems too derogatory.


This was not MP inserting brand new code into the network. This was a proposed idea. Maybe not a ready for primetime, and I suspect that even without the braintrust that claims they'll leave if they're not at the helm, there would be others that would spot the flaws you claim to have spotted long before such a change makes it to production.
Come to think of it, here's a proposal I know will sink like a lead zepplin (I just enjoy that phrase).
Remember at the first Republican Debate, where Fox asked each of the candidates "will you pledge to not run as an independent should you not be appointed the nominee"?
Wouldn't it be nice if you guys would take a pledge and state that you'd continue doing your best to contribute to Bitcoins code base, even in the event that the community chooses new leadership? They're not rejecting your past efforts or even current work, just one sliver of your final vision for Bitcoin.
And as you and others have said before - you all seem to have a lot of Bitcoins, both directly owned AND time-locked. To just declare Bitcoin a failure over such a simple thing and abandon those time locked coins, just seems short sighted. And you all seem like smart people, I don't get how you can really think that such a minor event ought to be the end of everything as we know it.
After all, I was a fan of a lot of Mike Hearn's work and essays, but was equally unimpressed with his parting actions, and would hope for something more mature from the people who have the most vested interest in the system, and who have contributed the most to it, than just walk away and call it a failure.

They don't want to move the market with their own purchase, because that will mean that they'll move the market on the way out too. Which makes any valuation meaningless ("you have an asset that's worth $500 million dollars, except if you try to sell it, you'll probably only fetch $300 million for it").
End result - $100 million is likely too bit of a slice for anyone to take, if they're under any advisement by people who are aware of Bitcoin and its liquidity issues.
And the next part - the floor. That's an "if". And a big "if". You're talking billionaires - they don't need if's anymore. And if they do, they'll stick with what they know.

Cash suffers the same amount of inflation, without erosion of the principal amount (you lose purchasing power, but have the same amount of dollars at the end). Where investing in negative yielding bonds has you lose both purchasing power AND actual dollars as well.
So that's no good.
Negative real rates are much more palatable than negative interest rates, just like people say about Bitcoin when the price is falling "I haven't lost anything, I still have the same amount of Bitcoins".

You don't have to buy a newly issued bond to gamble on interest rates, currently traded bonds will react in just the same way
And without having a looking glass into the future, why would you put your money in a negatively yielding product for anything but the shortest amount of time?  Rates go positive and you're in t-bills or money markets - you're fine. Rates go positive and you're holding negatively yielding 10 year notes? Ouch. 
I don't see the Bitcoin connection. 
Nothing would stop governments and people with cash flow surpluses from lending to those that need money, whether the medium of exchange is dollars, yen, Bitcoin or gold. Well, I guess there would be no more worry about exchange rate risk, but that could also be a negative, in that should the world currency slump, there wouldn't be any safe havens.

What, pray tell, are those limitations, and how does bitcoin provide superior experience?
* The limitation of being able to withdraw cash at nearly any location, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week?
* The limitation of having their depositors insured, so that they know that if the bank goes titsup, their money is still safe (supposing they're below the FDIC limit, of course)
* The limitation of having the information regarding their deposits stored on a network of fault-tolerant computers, manned by some of the most competent security professionals out there? And again, the limitation that even if someone gets through all that and accesses their account, they will recover their money?

Photography uses JPEG compression, which throws data our irrevocably. It just uses math to approximate the original image.
Use that same technique on the blockchain... Say "well, these 8000 transactions appear to be almost alike, lets just delete those then and replace with this one transaction". How's your blockchain going to look later?
The compression technologies used for photos, music and video are not applicable to any other format for the simple reason that they are lossy algorithms, rather than lossless algorigthms.
And that said, even a lossless compression algorithm will yield significantly better results on the typical photo than it would on a block of cryptographic hashes.

So bitcoin has value because it's the reward for validating other bitcoin transactions, and many of those transactions are simply the issuance of new bitcoins, which need to be validated, therefore giving all the previous coins value as well? Is that?
One day, the supply of coins will be exhausted. Long before that, absent a huge increase in value of bit coins, mining will be completely and utterly worthless as a means to make money. But lets just say ever coin gets mined eventually. There is no more incentive to mine, since there's no reward for doing so. Miners will stop because there will no longer be a reward for their very real expenses that you outlined, therefore the ensured sanctity of transactions will be no more. 
Sounds like when either of those days come - the reward for mining is less than the expense of doing so, or there simply aren't any more coins left to provide miners, then it's game over. There's no longer any verification and validation of transactions. People with large stashes of coins won't even be able to dispose of them or exchange them, since the network won't be able to verify their transactions any longer....

I'm going to play non-devils advocate and point out that the Fed won't care less if you keep your dollars in the bank or at home.

What part?
That opening a payment channel requires a on-chain transaction? A payment channel is a essentially a multisig transaction that gets continually updated, until the participants choose to settle it. You can't take coins from your wallet, and move pay through a lightning hub without making an onchain transaction to get to the hub, nor will you be able to create a channel directly from yourself to each of the people you might spend money to, because each channel will have to be fully funded by the maximum amount you expect to spend with them. 
Not to mention, that a payment channel should only stay open while the computers that control the wallets at both ends are on, and there could be security implications if one of them is turned off or disconnected from the internet while a channel is open. So, it's a tech for servers thing.
Or the prohibitively expensive part? You know, where a fee market needs to be created, where regular transactions ought to take place off chain, with the block chain only being used for settlements.

You can still lose if you're investing for the short term. Even the medium term - recall that it took almost a decade for the DOW and S&amp;p to breach their previous highs, and the Nasdaq still hasn't.

And yes, index fund can have thousands of companies, but that doesn't make them foolproof. Equities are generally correlated, meaning that they move close to in tandem.

To your second point, That's what interest is for. You can set a rate of interest for a note that is equal at all times to X% or even CPIU + x%. I've done plenty of notes like that myself. It's on the lender to set an interest rate that they believe will exceed the rate of inflation, or they can account for inflation in the note itself. If they don't, then courts aren't obligated to fix that oversight for them
 Likewise specifying that on the repayment date Y shall be delivered (5000 ounces of silver) or its cash equivalent, that would absolutely stand up in court as long as it was worded into the note and there was some basis for it (you couldn't loan an amount equal to 1,000 ounces of silver and demand repayment of 5000 ounces or its cash equivalent one year later, that would be usurious. But if the loan was the value of 5,000 ounces in the first place, or even 4,500 ounces (to allow for interest) that would be perfectly reasonable. 
Aside from usery, most states' laws are meant to protect the creditor. And again, legal tender is generally there to allow the lender the ability to decline an attempt to repay a loan where the borrower attempts to introduce a substitute. Like, Bob couldn't argue that he attempted to repay His loan to Alice because, in lieu of X dollars, he delivered 10 cows to her which he claimed were worth at least X dollars. There the court would say that since it wasn't legal tender Alice didn't have to accept it. Flip side being that Bob borrows from Alice and the note says that on repayment date, he is to deliver 10 cows; then, Bob could deliver enough money for Aluve to buy 10 cows rather than the cows themselves.

They're held by DTCC for ease of processing; you can request physical certificates from many companies still, though paper is going by the wayside, with most companies preferring to keep electronic ledgers of ownership. Still, you can have your shares registration changed from "street name" to directly held by you on the companies books, if you desire. Not much advantage in that, though.

Yes, Even for its shortcomings, Bitcoin is the leader and not likely to go anywhere. If there had been a real competitor a couple years back, there might have been a chance, but back then the only real efforts were to make changes to the way coins were initially distributed. Then the floodgates opened for everyone and their mother to create their own pump and dump alt. 
Not to say Bitcoin is impervious; any app or website that interacts with the blickchain can be made to interact with nearly any other coins' daemon and blickchain with just a couple changes to their code. 
But yes, regardless, effort should be made to increase accessibility. After all, any changes made to Bitcoin in that regard will propagate to the alts as well, since they all draw on BTC's source

You'll know plenty about "copycat funds". They need to file with the sec just like everyone else. Unless they go pink sheets, but pink sheets are generally only slightly less scammy than most Bitcoin securities to date. 
Likewise, GBTCs popularity isn't correlated to bitcoins prices. Sounds strange and counter intuitive, I know, but without an arbitrage mechanism, the fund won't go into the market to buy more coin or sell them, in contrast to an ETF Like coin.

The evidence gathered by the corrupt agents was for the Maryland case, which hasn't even started yet. They had nothing to do with the arrest or the handling of evidence during or after the arrest. Yes, one of the agents stole money and made it look like it was Curtis greens doing, but DPR conferred with his employees and confidants and concluded the guy should be killed with no egging on from Force. 
Let's not forget that Ross kept a journal outlining everything, had IDs for moderators on his computer, some of whom plan to plead guilty, and extensive chat logs. The computer with all of this on it was purchased by Ross from Amazon.  He contested none of that. 
The evidence on the server he might have tried to have overturned, but to do so he would have had to claim a personal interest in the server, which he didn't. Even the judge seemed surprised at this. 
Really, it's hard to see where Forces involvement could have any real bearing on the outcome of this case. Maybe it'll impact the mAryland case where the evidence he gathered will play a part, but that's not clear either. 
Really before making any reactions, did you read the plethora of court documents and exhibits that gwern and others purchased for us to see? Did you read the judges briefs and findings throughout the trial? It's easy to claim corruotion and outrage, but the evidence, all uncontested save for putting forward the theory that it was all planted through his use of BitTorrent, somehow.

When banks ignore/scoff at Bitcoin, they get chastised for not getting it.

I'd say that the lack vendors accepting bitcoins is a big issue holding back adoption. Plus, it's got great features for vendors, but "no charge bscks" isn't really a feature that will draw consumer interest. And with the lack of stability, people who are slightly interested are probably scared away - why buy a Bitcoin today in case you want to spend it tomorrow, especially when the overriding trend for the last year and a half has been declining prices. 
I've said it before and gotten scoffed at and diwnvited, and I'll say it again - if we want to see mass adoption, WE need to help drive it. Accumulating crypto currency under each of our mattresses and refusing to spend it, for whatever excuse we want to give ("oh no, I'll have to rebut those coins and it'll cost me 1% at the exchange" or "what good is spending the coins, you know the merchant is just going to sell them for fiat"), that's NOT the way to build an economy and a new ecosystem. 
People mistakenly think that bitcoins scarcity is enough to drive its value to the moon; it's not. Demand is. And the only way to build that demand is to put our money where our mouth is and transact with it. Maybe once vendors start seeing enough Bitcoin transactions coming through, and realizing that they don't need to set aside funds to cover future charge backs, they'll see the light and start offering a slightly reduced price for their goods to Bitcoin buyers, just as gas stations provide discounts on fuel to cash paying gas purchasers versus credit card spending ones. 
If we're convinced that this is the best currency ever,we should spend it to show vendor and customers. Short term, yes, we might end up paying more simply because of fees at the exchange to replenish what was spent. But to talk about bitcoins superiority, then refuse to utilize it, AND THEN expect that the rest of the world should hop on, that, to me, makes zero sense. 
TLDR: it's not too difficult to get your first Bitcoin. There just isn't interest. It's too easy to get overwhelmed by the excitement on reddit and bitcointalk, and forget that the rest of the world simply doesn't see the utility, not will they unless we show it to them. By far the biggest motivation I see is for people to accumulate coins and lock them away. That's great if you want a collection of internet tokens, but if you want an economy that uses these things, well, we're the early adopters - we should be championing our currency and spending it where ever we can, not silently stashing it away. 
There is only slight difficulty in acquiring ones first Bitcoin. The overriding issue is that most who hear about Bitcoin in passing will say "that's neat. What should I want that, though?", not "that's great, how do I get some?"

So let me get this straight, I shouldn't be interested in digital cash because I don't subscribe to an extreme libertarian ideology? Not very inclusive, don't you think?
Your examples are strictly first world problems. (Oh no, the evil record companies went after someone for pirating music!). I'm talking about real human rights abuses that corporations engage in in the rest of the world, abuses they haven't dared attempt in the first world not because of Internet reputation systems but because of strong government preventing those actions. 
Violations you'll see if you follow that link include: rampant pollution of groundwater, rivers, oceans, price gouging through monopoly power, forced evictions, restricting people's right to free movement and to protest, unsafe work conditions, financing conflict, mislabeling products, and so forth. 
You don't see corporations fielding private armies here, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Look to oil companies in west Africa. Gazprom, Russia's oil giant, is now fielding its own private armies:
World wide, there are huge nunbers of private security companies. Tons of them. We hear about blackwater/xi/academi being hired to work in war zones. Or rather than in military zones, let's look at private security vs public policing, and use one of their own sites listing the "advantages" of private security forces:
*1.	 Private security firms have more authority on private property than police. In addition, private security firms represent the property owners. The police, even off duty on special assignment, represent the City, County or State they work for. The police, even off duty, have to follow the guidelines set forth in the 4th and 14th Amendments of the US Constitution.*
*2.	The police cannot stop anyone to ask if they live on property, what they are doing, etc. This is a violation of a person’s Constitutional Rights which could open the police or property owner up for a civil suit. The police are not allowed to speak to anyone unless they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime may be afoot. Further, they must be able to articulate this suspicion in clear language. Private security can interact with anyone at any time. Because they do not represent the Government and the Constitution does not apply to private security.*
*6.	There are also civil law issues. Police work in the “criminal realm”. They are not allowed to become involved in civil matters. Property owner rights, lease agreements and other such issues are civil matters. The police have no knowledge or responsibility in these areas. Private security firms do. Private security operates in both the civil and criminal realm. This is also another area that confuses police… Security officers can move freely between civil and criminal matters.*
You'll note the first two advantages they cite is their ability to ignore constitutional rights. True, public police have been getting exposed committing all sorts of atrocities lately, but do you really think that life being policed by private security forces who swear not to protect the public at large, but only the interests of their private employer, with no regard for the constitution (which wouldn't exist without government to protect it, after all), do you really think that's preferable. 
So I urge you to look past your first world grievances and see what happens in the rest of the world where governments can't reign in corporate power and abuse. It's not pretty. We've only been allowed to develop these fantasies because all that stuff has so far occurred "over there" rather than here. But yes, let's worry about movie piracy. That makes sense. 
More over, why should I not be allowed to have interest in digital cash, Internet money, simply because I'm frightened of what the world would be like under corporate leadership?

Discount for lack of control, lack of convertibility to bitcoin, lack of control of the private key. Plus IIRC there's a 2% management fee over just holding BTC directly.
Yes, even it you held shares of COIN, you can't convert to the underlying unless you have 50,000 shares, but just knowing that there are players that can arbitrage it will keep it inline with BTC, whereas GBTC isn't  arbitragable. There's no reason for it to trade at a premium in the long term, and if it falls below book/"par", there's no guaranteed mechanism to normalize prices as there would be with COIN.
That's just my opinion... I think that GBTC is the inferior product that will only get takers because COIN isn't trading yet; once COIN starts trading, no reason to own GBTC over COIN. Even if GBTC went to a massive discount, say 20%, there's no players that can arbitrage it back to a "normal" value...
It's not abnormal for closed end funds...
DHY (credit suisse high yield bond fund) trades at 2.80
ZDHYX (it's reported book value) is 2.92 (i.e., the fund trades at a 4% discount to its assets)
CAF - (Morgan Stanley China A Shares Fund) trades at 36.05
XCAFX - (its book value) is $42.80 (i.e. CAF trades at an 18% discount to assets)
(Protip: you can find the NAV (net asset value) of a closed end fund by adding an X to the beginning and end of its ordinary ticker symbol)
Mutual funds trade at NAV only at end of day.
CEF (Closed end funds) trade at whatever value the market gives throughout the day
ETF (exchange traded funds) trade at whatever value the market given throughout the day, with the added feature that "authorized participants" can create or redeem shares whenever, which acts as almost a guarantee that the price of an ETF won't deviate too far from it's NAV 
(if an ETF trades far above its NAV, an authorized participant can go and buy a baskets worth of the underlying assets, turn them over to the ETF provider and receive 50,000 shares to sell into the market, nearly risk free; likewise, if an ETF trades at a sever discount to its NAV, then that authorized participant can go buy 50,000 shares of the ETF, and immediately convert them to the underlying to sell those shares into the market, helping keep the price of an ETF inline with its underlying asset value; no such mechanism exists for CEF's)

People who invested in Second Markets BIT fund can convert their BIT shares to the OTC-traded GBTC shares after owning them for a year.

Right. So, the pint of this trust less consensus is that the chain with the most work behind it is the correct one. Except in one instance, the chain that managed to have the most work behind it, the devs, miners, etc changed their minds after the fact and rolled back transactions, block awards, etc and built up the shorter chain. 
I understand there's more to it than that, the how's and the whys, but I think the event is still illustrative in that devs and miners specifically worked against the one of the most basic tenets of Bitcoin and rejected the chain with more computational work behind it.

5 cents  plus $10 in newly mined coins 
We're in a phase that Bitcoin transavtions are heavily subsidized, but that income to miners is real and is necessary for them to operate profitably. That incentive will disappear in time and as it does, you\we will have to adjust to a non-subsidized existence. 
Sure, right now fees are minimal - you can even get the occasional transaction through without a fee - but that reality will be changing as rewards go down. So, enjoy the low fees now, but know there changing.

Bitcoin prices don't fluctuate any more extremely than futures and forex (as you typically allowed huge amounts of leverage in those markets), and margin calls proceed smoothly. Basically the exchange will send out a call for equity when your account reaches x% and will close out your positions on their own if you hit y%. A margin call is a courtesy- they expect traders to know what their positions are doing. So if there's a violent move in the market and your account lacks the equity, they might move to close out your position without issuing a call. 
To your next point, btc can be anonymous, yes, but I can't imagine any exchange offering leveraged trading to anonymous traders. KYC and AML issues Aside, offering margin/leverage to traders without verifying their ID is a certain route to going out of business...

That might have been true in December 2013. Now, someone panicking might stumble across Bitcoin, notice how it's failed to be a store of value since then, and move on to dollars, gold or just paper euros. 
The rapid price decline is not a good advertisement for Bitcoin. Can't argue it, it's price history is there for anyone to examine. And while btc might excite people from a technological or political angle, from a financial angle I can't imagine a newconer jumping into BTC as a safety play.

You probably know this, but for the sake of people here that don't, let me just mention that a self directed IRA isn't the same as a normal IRA. Most people mistakenly think that, since they choose which stocks to buy in their IRA's brokerage account, they assume that's a self directed IRA. 
Self directed IRA's are different beasts - they allow you to invest in things that you can't buy through q brokerage - the most common thing is usually rental or investment property, hedge funds are another option, things like yeah. A self directed ira usually take the form of an LLC - well, you contribute your money to your self directed IRAs custodian (there are companies that do this), that custodian invests it into an LLC which you manage; and then you can buy a much wider range of assets than you could with just a brokerage account. Your self directed IRA can have a brokerage account too. 
There are custodial fees involved though. I recall a $500 annual fee plus $x per asset or trabsaction (where x= $35 to $50). So, if you're just staring saving for your retirement, and only have a years worth of contributions in it (or worse, if you couldn't make a full contribution) then the fees as a percentage of assets will make it not worth it at all. Most reputable custodians/trustees won't even accept accounts that small, so no need to worry, really. 
But there's a bunch of companies that do this already out there. No need for a Bitcoin centric one. 
Anyone interested in learning more, look them up.  Google self directed IRA, self directed IRA custodian or self directed IRA trustee to get starter in the right direction. Checkbook IRA is another one.

Instruction for conversion and transfer went to BIT holders on Fruday.  If they reacted immediately, their letters would have only gotten back to second market Fruday afternoon. Probably need to have their signatures medallion guaranteed, which would require a trip to the bank or their brokerage firms branch office and mailing the original in. But even without that, they get their requests to convert to GBTC to second market Friday afternoon, securities don't move on weekends, so the soonest they could try to push the shares to their clients brokerage account is today, and all that does is notify each brokerage that there are shares for them to pull in and allocate to client accounts, which requires intervention fro. Their back offices. 
Realistically, weds or Thursday would be the soonest we should see those share arrive, and that's only if they didn't require medallion. Guarantee.

Well Bitcoin will always be different than other investable assets. No matter the level of regulation, if the private key falls or can be assembled by untrustworthy hands, then that party can irrevocably transfer the exchanges assets away. Same can't be said for stocks and bonds, a dishonest broker can't take their clients shares and never be found out, or not have the transfer reversed. 
I think the words are just words, but they necessarily have to be applied differently in Bitcoin land than other financial places. They'll never be equivalent, as there is no way to make them so...

It's not inflation that's causing bitcoins price fluctuations, it's speculation. The next halving won't be the cause of greater stability. Not saying it won't stabilize, as Bitcoin will be that much older, but for right now the inflation rate has next to no effect on its value, I don't think. I mean, if it did, then inflation would be responsible for an 11% decline in price, which is just a small fraction of the actual decline

Like i said, I became interested in Bitcoin based on the promise of its decentralized nature. The fixed coin cap honestly seems restraining to me, but it was something I knowingly came into fully aware that it couldn't be changed. At no time was it evident that it would aspire to become a global payment system with huge fees, middlemen, and limited transactability, all of which seem to be the new vision of so many Core advocates (some, who want to bolster the fee market and feel that even $20 per transaction should/will be a fair fee, others who advocate for off chain activity, and the many who now push for side chains/LN, technologies that exist only as white papers, rather than encouraging general adoption and usage of the block chain to store the transactional data that it's meant to store.

Yes - for that functionality, you need access to a full node (computer running bitcoind). Preferably, this shouldn't be your internet facing server. 
Second thought, technically you don't even need a node for most of that functionality, you can generate Bitcoin addresses and their corresponding private keys without a node at all, populate the database on your webseever with the addresses, while keeping the private keys offline, which would make it impossible for a hacker to send coins without your say so...
Basically the only part that would need the access to a node (or an API from a 3rd party service) would be to actually see confirmations and/or check the balance of an address.

I'd say that Bitcoin trading is much more akin to forex trading than stock trading. Or bond buying if you're purchasing from a primary dealer. In that sense, yes, the exchanges just provide data for a fee, while dealers and market makers collect spreads and brokerages collect commissions. 
Bitcoin is not the equities market though. Over at forex.com, there are no commissions, just the spread. How do they (forex.com(make money if not by pocketing that spread?

Yes, but sending more coins than are in one address links you to multiple addreSes. Never mind that most people don't use unique addreSes for each transaction - look at people's profiles here, their sigs, vanity addresses, etc. want to see how those get funded? Look at my own profile, that mulisig address is there hecause that's where bit-x sends coins... 
Linking disparate addresses is just a little more difficult than trivial, but not at all impossible. The hard part is linking a name or identity to those addresses, but if you see those addresses being funded by, or sending coins to an exchange or payment processor that complies with US laws, odds are they'll have your Identity. And so forth. 
Yes, if used perfectly, Bitcoin could be tough to track... But no one is perfect, somewhere along the way everyone will eventually engage in a transaction that leaves the counterparts in possession of their identity. 
The blickchain after all is a ledger, plain and simple. It makes no effort to obscure anything within it.

That's not how it works, because there are no truly free markets.
That's why the government used to have limits on the amount of media a single entity could control in a single market, due to that entities ability to shape knowledge and therefore the debate. And there has been outrage as the government has backed off of that.
Sure, anyone can make a new forum, but the simple fact is that even though everyone can choose their media, the most popular channels still happen to be under the absolute control of person, and too many people seem to be fine with that. Everyone revolts when the BIP101 implementation guys even mention "benevolent dictator" in terms of leadership of development, but at the same time, so many are quick to defend the same "benevolent dictatorship" that Theymos gets to exert on the two main forums that Bitcoin users congregate on.

Other clients at your broker. 
With stocks, when you sign up for a margin account, which allows you to borrow cash from your broker, part pf your agreement with them allows them to loan out your shares to their other clients. Who ever borrows them still has to pay you your dividends, etc, so you're not losing anything there. Most retail brokers will pocket the borrow fees they collect, but if you have a larger account or, I can think of one broker in specific, you can be credited for some or most of the fees they collect. 
For Bitcoin, I suspect it's basically the same. YOURE borrowing coins from either the exchange itself or their clients, transparently, so you don't have to negotiate each borrow ahead of time.

Until GBTC starts trading, there hasn't been any means of buying Bitcoin exposure through a stock brokerage, so there hasn't been any need for such firms to "educate" their employees. Not like they provide education about every stock and Etf that trades; the roll of a brokerage is to provide you access to stocks to buy or trade on your own; they might provide independent research, but not investment advice. 
Regardless, you probably dropped your check off with the receptionist. She doesn't represent Schwabs opinion, and really, you might have elicited the same sort if outburst if you said "so, how do you think Obama is doing?"
It doesn't sound like she was calling you out as a terrorist, but you mentioned an investment that isn't well known outside of a very small circle, and we already know that the media has been misinforming people about it, you just happened to bump into someone who listened to enough of that media to get that disinformation.

Doubtful. IF JPM is going to start penalizing its client banks for parking cash with them (which is their strategy to reduce  the size of their balance sheets, which is what their goal is), those clients, if they can't find another safe bank to park cash at, can easily buy T-Bills... Which have the feature of being "safe"/"stable", something that BTC can't claim (at least the second).
Note that this is only being proposed by JPM's biggest clients. I'd wager that most ordinary customers of big banks (not regional banks, not credit unions), already have effectively negative interest rates... 0.01% interest, plus $20/month banking fees, etc...

People are still hung up on the IRS VS FINCEN thing?
The IRs deemed Bitcoin to be an investment asset for tax purposes only. Which is of great benefit to holders.
FINCEN calls it a currency because people trade it for items of value. If compsny stock was easily transferable from person to person, outside of exchanges or transfer agents, it certainly would be regulated by FINCEN as well. Bearer bonds were paper certificates that gave to the holder the right to collect interest and principal payments without any form of regulation; due to money laundering concerns, tbs treasury stopped issuing bearer bonds back in the 80's I believe (and I think they're all due at this point). Thats the government itself messing up and providing a easy tool for money transmission and laundering and then taking it's product off the market. 
BerkshirEBucks (I guess they're cakked Bitshares, now) are a local currency, only spendable in a very small area; you can use them at participating stores in Lenox and Great Barrington, but not Boston (same state) and certainly not California or London. And, a long time ago (when they were beekshire bucks) you could spend them wherever they were accepted, but you could only buy or sell them for cash at participating banks, meaning institutions that were already regulated. 
So, Bitcoin isnt singled out individually. The government called itself out a few decades ago. Berkshire bucks aren't sone whilly nilly invention by a couple random people (not delegating bitcoins, let me finish my sentence), they were a local project that took a lot of research effort and time to pull off, specifically to make sure they didn't break any existing state or federal laws, and ultimately were issued with involvement by banks; regardless, they're a local currency, so doubtful that FINCEN had as many eyes looking at Berkshire bucks, (which again were developed being mindful of applicable laws) and if issues did crop up, it was a local news story, not a news item that could affect millions upon millions in just about every country in the world. And BB'a are past their infancy stage, everything's been ironed out, etc. but even before then, FIZnCEN had a single point of contact to address concerns to, so any issues they found could be addressed immediately.
Bitcoins a different beast; again, tax wise is good that it's an investment asset; comparing it to non-dollars, it's much more comparable to electronically issued bearer bond than regional paper money; the denominations it can be used to transfer are huge, they can be transferred and turned to fiat anywhere in the world, etc. the govt pulled it's bonds out of the market as a consequence of their unintended uses; the government can't do that to Bitcoin; nor is there a central authority for FINCEN to call up to discuss issues. without that sort of contact, all they can do is issue rulings and see how the community reacts, etc. and then one day, either the givt and FINCEN will be no more (I don't believe this myself, but lots of people in the community dream about it), or else they'll have essentially finished issuing rulings, US Bitcoin exchajrs and the like will be operating in ways they can understand, and this chaotic segment of Bitcojns history will be just that; history. And then, some developer of a new currency will start being bombarded with FINCEN rulings and will think they're being unfairly targeted because not only are the well-estabilshed local currencies, developed with an aim to be compliant with whatever FINCEN demanded, operating without a hitch, but even Bitcoin operators are no longer being focused in by regulators

Plus escrow isn't free - you're paying additional for that. And you need to trust the provider to not abscond with your funds. And merchants have to hope that you'll even release your funds from escrow (though they also have to hope you'll not chargeback, the difference being that releasing from escrow is an additional step to take, whereas With a cc, you only have to take the additional step if you are unhappy with the transaction.

Consensus rules aren't software rules, they're rules that we all understand and agreed to when we decided to become involved in Bitcoin. 
I would define 21 million coins as a consensus rule/understanding. SHA256 proof of work would be another. Even the 10 minute block time. This was all CLEARLY explained in Satoshi's white paper, and what we all agreed to get involved with.
NOWHERE was it ever explained that the 1 MB block size limit was a "rule" that wouldn't be changed. I certainly never would have gained interest in a currency that could only allow 2 or 3 transactions per second around the entire globe. And I am absolutely certain that when I brought this up long before this current debate, the resounding answer was simply "chill - when we need more capacity, it'll be trivial to change the block size".
clearly not.
So no. Saying this 1 MB "rule" is a consensus rule is false, in my understanding of how consensus works. A 1 MB block size/7 tps MAX rate was never described as being part of the feature set of bitcoin. It's only being claimed to be now that and decided to take a step beyond endless chatter and put the issue behind us so that the "core" devs can concentrate on better things than endless debate and forums and committees and flights around the world in order to solve a very simple issue.
So no. Stop pretending that the block size debate would in any way give legitimacy to anyone else's notion about increasing the total number of coins.

Hackers didn't break into Gox and steal coins. Karpeles basically kept a false set of books, one reflecting what customers thought they had, one reflecting what they actually had. 
A regulated company of goxs size would have to be provide quarterly reportings, signed by CPAs who would be risking their license and potentially freedom if they knowingly made fraudulent filings, and would be need to be open to surprise visits from state and federal regulators. 
Sure, that wouldn't prevent bad behavior - nothing can stop someone from absconding with all the bitcoins at once and trying to flee the country, but in a Gox scenario where a company misappropriated funds but is trying desperately to make good, that would come to light rapidly, rather than only after they exhausted all attempts to right the ship. 
Sorry, but this is the norm. Financial companies - ones that hold assets of other people - have to Comply with rules that force greater responsibility. In essense, had Gox fell under regulation and been in compliance, the charade would have been up far earlier and cost people far less money, as their books and records would have shown the gaps immediately. Instead, they published a video from roger ver saying "don't worry, everything is all right"
Yes, they'll stifle competition. Competition from fly by night operators who are afraid of disclosing their financial strength or weakness. Competition that wants to provide their customers with zero indication if their financial strength or ability to be responsible stewards of the funds entrusted to them. Given how many losses have occurred in the Bitcoin space of utterly unregulated investments - Bitcoin savings &amp; trust, ASICMINer, and of course, mtgox, it's fairly apparent that lack of regulation is causing huge harm to customers/investors, who have to evaluate investments and services on their stated merits and then essentially flip a coin in hopes that the operator doesn't suddenly decide to announce the jig is up.

The only reason that XT is in the equation is because the Core devs rejected Gavins proposal, which would have required a miner vote on the matter. Bitcoin doesn't contain an alternate technique for polling community sentiment, and adding such logic would cause a hard fork on its own, so polling miners and significant service providers (as he did, via reaching out to Coinbase, etc) is about the only responsible way to have proceeded. Since "Core" devs opted not to give their blessing for that method, Hearn integrated the change into XT. There are alternates, like XT Big Blocks only which drops the changes you allude to.
However, there's a certain amount of FUD about XT, it's clear. For one the "penalizing" of Tor connections done on a node by node basis and only if that node feels its under attack. Certainly attacks could come from outside of Tor, but it's easier to deal with those vectors at the firewall level. Hearns proposal simply drops Tor connections for a short period and then re-allows their connectivity later on, and again, only for the node that is under attack. Tor users can continue to relay transactions to other nodes.
As for "phoning home" with your IP, where has this allegation come from? Not that it's of huge concern, it's a simple matter to discover the IP's of all of Bitcoins full nodes already, but I'd just like to know where you're getting this information from.

Hedge funds would have no problem. Even mutual funds can buy private/non traditional assets if they disclose that as part of their strategy. 
Yes, certain investment policy statements will outline the assets a fund or asset manager can purchase, but I'm not sure that GBTC would be viewed any different than Bitcoin itself; just because it trades on the stock exchanges doesn't mean it's an equity; it's certainly not a bond - it'll land squarely under "other".  And any fund manager that's worth his salt will discuss changing the investment policy statement in order to clarify whether or not they can make Bitcoin related investments, and if they go that far they'll certainly raise the fee issue (if we buy GBTC there's an embedded 2% fee, meaning we need to earn 2% per year to break even, versus buying Bitc directly, which would be over and above the fees the manager charges. ) will raise the holding directky 
Additionally, as I said earlier, GBTCs lack of convertibility to the underlying means that it's price won't necessarily be correlated to BTCs own returns. 
Short version: rolling Bitcoin into an investment vehicle that trades on stock exchanges won't allow equity manager to buy it and claim it's a stock. And once BTC issue is raised, if there is agreement that Bitcoin is an appropriate investment, it won't be too much a stretch to explain the advantage of buying directly.

Again, my understanding of monero and dash is that they succeed in this regard. Coins transferred from one wallet to the next aren't as easily traceable as Bitcoin. Just as introducing a tumbler can break the link between your wallet and the one you're sending to.

if you post an bitcoin address, that's linkable to you. if you spend from that address and another (you spend more coin than are in any single address), that will link an additional address to you. Analyzing how those addresses were funded will yield even more information (mining pool? - if they keep logs, they might be subpoenable to get your IP Address), coinbase or circle (they have your IRL ID). Did you send coin to an address that emptied itself into Bitstamps hot or cold storage? Then Likely they or their customer (who you bought something from) has your ID.
Anonymity is really hard these days... 
This is just what I can come up with given 30 seconds of thinking... I'm certain more given time. But if an organization that can monitor the internet backbone, probably knew about the OpenSSL bugs long before the public did, and who likely has sanctioned or unsantioned backdoor access to most any site they want, if that sort of organization has interest in you, then they will discover what they're looking for, I don't doubt that... 
But overall, given enough time and lousy practices (address reuse being primary, but even without reuse, applying pressure to those who funded those addresses), it's not rocket science to tie together all this info. I mean, it's basically already in a database for them, given time and people sloppiness, more and more of it will become crystal clear.
But with the unchangeable nature of the blockchain, there really isn't much reason for them to exert much info in capturing real time information - the BC will always be there for them to exam, years, decades after the fact...

In what context would it be more profitable to harm the network than to mine, aside from a 51% attack? And again, if your attack against miners is to create large blocks that take a long time to propagate to them, giving you the heeadstart in mining the next block, it goes the other way too, where every bit of delay in getting your block to the network means another miner could have gotten theirs propagated and built off of first.

You mean like faucets?
Problem is, free services that give away bitcoins are very stingy; rightly so - if they gave away anything more than nominal amounts, they'll be taken to the cleaners by the community. 
So the dust you can get from a faucet, while free, isn't enough to get anyone who isn't already into Bitcoin to want to get a wall let to withdraw their coin. It's not even worth it fori most of us that have wallets. Then threres changetip. That's nice, but again, if you tip me, I have a wallet so I'll claim the tip and withdraw it immediately. Tip someone a quarter, or heck, even $5 who doesn't have or use Bitcoin already, they're not likely to see the appeal. 
Where can they spend them? 
How do they convert them to cash? Find an exchange, open account, transfer coins there, provide all your ID And banking details, just to withdraw $5? Not happening. 
If you can think of a way to get more than nominal amount of Bitcoin into new hands while not simply giving them to all of us who will say "cool, free bitcoins!" By all means go for it.  
 it's easy to get coins to people, even utter newbies. But the problem is, they're not likely to see the value in it, or even if they do see the value, they're not likely to think the value is great enough to go through the effort of claiming those coins.

The article is not at all researched - any Bitcoin exchange ("gateway" in its parlance) can freeze any users funds, or all trading as a whole.

A lot of people might not like paying taxes, but they'ed rather pay than get caught for not paying. Besides which, Roth contributions are made with after tax money, while the distributions you receive upon reaching retirement age will/should be tax free, as are any transactions within the Roth (Bitcoin goes up to $10,000 and you sell some, you don't have to pay capital gains tax on that). So really, doing all this inside a Roth (supposing you can live without accessing that money til you're 65, which really should be the case, they are your retirement funds after all), let's you participate in Bitcoin economically without all the tax headache that's been hitting people the last couple years. 
Beside, to your tax evasion hopes, if you're buying and selling your coins through an exchange, they'll issue you a 1099 and report your proceeds to the government. So unless you're only buying fave to fave with LBC, Uncle Sam will know. Doing it in a Roth actually gives that "kind uncle" the fewest taxes... (Again, no tax on gains within the Roth, no tax on qualified distributions, and it's aftet tax money you put in there in the first place)'

well trading platform is already a nomenclature used in the other financial markets which doesn't match this definition. 
I could go with Tradinh something, for sites that only allow trading among coins (btc/ltc) or coins and fiat without the ability to receive fiat to your bank account. But then a separate term needs to be created for sites that can interface with your bank account in order to differentiate them.

They can't shut down LBC, but they could easily go after buyers and sellers simply by posting ads of their own or responding to the same. A few high profile arrests resulting in disproportionate fine ("man fined $50,000 for $500 Bitcoin transaction"). 
It won't dissuade the real true believers, but it would dramatically lower Bitcoins utility to them. And would scare the masses away sufficiently as well.

If one miner changed the block award rules without the OK by all the others, then their blocks would be rejected by the others the moment that rule actually took effect.
And likewise, it's open source software - the entire community would be clued in to what they were thinking, it's not like no one would know that a MAJOR change was being planned, and that alone would likely cause a big dislocation in the markets.

Says who? That's never the case. Well, that might have been the case way back when, before electronic brokerages; some dealers may have only allowed the purchase or sale of "round lots" (as opposed to "odd lots", which are bids or asks not in increments of 100, generally. For some high priced stocks, as few as 10 shares can constitute a  round lot. 
But unless Gbtc is unique in the world of listed stocks,  you can buy as many or as few shares as you'd like, it's just that they only post the bids and asks for round lots for the workd to see; if you have access to live market data (usually provided for free from brokerages to non-professional clients) your brokerage usually offers tools to get better clarity. 
Tl/dr: bid/ask info is usually posted only bids and offers of whole/round lots, but that doesn't prevent anyone from buying fewer shares if they want.

I hope you don't have much money!
Yes diversification is key. Because no matter how convinced you can be, you have to keep in mind you lmight be wrong. Just like any one will say don't put all your money into a single stock
IN the context of sticks, the risks are many - the refinance of the company itself, the institutional perception of its industry (where a company could perform Beyond expectations, but institutional money is leaving the sector, causing a contraction in P/E ratios and therefore stock prices), managerial issues that investors might not agree with (a company doing well, for instance, and starting to distribute dividends to its investors can be a cause, as to many investors that's a sign that the company is out of growth ideas because it can't figure out anything to do with its cash on hand than return it to investors)
Those are some of the reasons that putting all your eggs in one basket of a publicly traded company might not work out to your expectation, even when it's doing well. 
Bitcoin avoids many of those issues, but what it doesn't avoid at all is investor sentiment. You can't cobtrol that at all. If the Bitcoin bulls remain enthusiastic, but no longer have enough money to commit to buying new bitcoins fast enough to offset the sales, that's could be a problem. 
And I have to believe that a LOT of bitcoins present value is From people's future expectations for it; it might reach those expectayions, yes, but if it takes too long in getting there, a lot of impatient money might move away. 
Laws could come into place that makes obtaining bitcoin much more difficult, by limiting exchanges, for example. Bitcoin CAN exist without exchanges, yes, but if liquidity dries up (as it would if everyone was forced to only transact for Bitcoin in LBC/face to face transactions), spreads would widen excessively for one, and the actual price would be impacted as well. 
This is all stuff you know, hopefully. And I'll cheerlead for  you. But know that concentrating your investments in highly speculative asset(s) can be recipe for disaster. 
What's wirse, is that it can be a disaster even if you're ultimately right, just wrong on the timing. Think dot com boom, bust and time time it took that index to regain those losses.

1 - KNC built 3 data centers in Sweden, no? That alone, land, material and labor, had to have been far more expensive than the Chinese have to pay.
2 - Given free electricity, any miner becomes profitable to operate. My old ASIC Miner USB Block Eruptors would yield a profit (extremely negligible, of course) if power was free. So the hemming and hawing about how Chinese miners wouldn't even yield a profit with free power... well, maybe that's an artifact of Google Translate?
3 - It could be that with fewer regulations in China, those miners investors simply aren't as well aware of what's coming up soon. Still, if people are pouring hundreds of millions into an industry, one would think that there would be some due diligence on the way. But given spectacular busts in the past, we can't discount anything.
4 - It could be that the Chinese simply have a cost advantage that KNC wasn't obtaining from its suppliers. Cheaper production, shorter distance to ship, lower taxes, no import duties, cheaper construction costs, cheaper power, that all adds up to a pretty significant advantage.

I don't know - i spend a disproportionate amount of time reading and puzzling about bitcoin, but I'm not a bull by any means.
Likewise, there are tons of stock analysts who extensively cover  companies that they have no position in, often times they're not allowed to have positions per their employer, but many times they simply choose to forgo having positions in order to appear non-biased.
Look at Seeking Alpha - yes, there are a ton of analysis' written by people who profess to holding positions i the companies they're reporting on, but there are even more written by people with no position whatsoever.
The moral of the story is, you can be an analyst without taking on a position in the investment you're covering. Many people will actually  give your analysis a great weighting, because even though you don't have 'skin in the game', it's also clear that you're writing what your true beliefs, rather than just writing in the hopes of causing a specific effect to occur.

What's the defense budget? What's the intelligence budget? What percentage if just those sound the government need to spend to develop and deploy their own Asics to 85% the network? Drops in the bucket. If they felt at all threatened by BTC, they could put an end to it with little effort. 
The cost to attack the Bitcoin network is negligible for any state actor. Even if they were buying their devices at retail. Which they wouldn't. When you do the math on Asic production costs, you'd see that:
a) the cost to attack they network is a lot less than anyone seems to imagine and 
B) the prices charged by Asic manufacturers are astronomical. Which makes sense, there's no reason to sell them for much less than they could be expected to mine over their lives. 
Look at the drops in prices;'m
Usb block eruptors came eu market around $200, but the last Batches that were sold were for a tiny fraction of that. 
Bfls jalapeños was originally offered at $149 I thinj, then went to $249, and is now $50 (of course bfl is... Well... BFL)
All the other miner manufacturers have shown the same (if not more) flexibility with their prices meaning they have huge margins.

Institutional investors, such ad hedge funds, endowments or pension funds, any of those that have done their due diligence, will know the absolute necessity in having control of ones private keys and therefore won't be obtaining exposure to bitcoin this way.
Likewise, with GBTC's 2% administrative fee, plus the 2% admin fee charged by many hedge funds (plus 20% performance/incentive payments), would mean that the investment has to return greater than 4% for their clients to break even. 
No, for most institutional types, if they're buying Bitcoin at all, they're buying directly, rather than absorb an extra layer of fees.  Not to mention the liability they could face if the private keys of any of these Bitcoin funds gets exposed. The conversation would go "so, after doing your DD, you determined that if anyone at Xxx obtained the private key to their wallet, that would wipe out the value of your investment in its entirety, and you still opted to buy those shares? How much did you invest? $2 million? You didn't think you could purchase a dedicated computer and backup system to hold bitcoins for a small fraction of the $40,000/yr admin fee that was being charged?"
No. No. No. 
Institutions won't be buying these shares. Other wealthy individuals will, as well ordinary investors.  The fees charged, alone, will keep institutions away, let alone the associated Risks of having others in control of securing the private keys"
Scratch that; if GBTC or COIN become marginqble, then they will present an option for going short bitcoin. 
I really think too many people have their hopes pinned to the equity markets and institutional money as being future drivers for Bitcoin, I don't think either is the case;
1) trades in the equity markets will follow the value of the underlying asset, not drive its value
2) institutional investors who do their due diligence will learn quickly thw Risks of having others control their bitcoins 
3) the fees charged by the two Bitcoin funds are astronomic
4) let's be honest, looking at btc history over the last couple years, hedge funds and the like most likely aren't exactly chomping at the bit to get in and go long.

I think a middle ground is most likely; existing in harmony with other currencies rather than replacing them. As for future value, I have no idea. Somewhere between zero and infinity, I'd say; the value of btc doesn't need to be astronomical for it to support  huge amount of transactions.

I kinda consider myself an armchair analyst... The problem is, as someone pointed out elsewhere in this thread, anyone whose analysis  points to anything but an upward trajectory for Bitcoin is attacked by the community. 
I used to write on Seeking Alpha - I'd lay out my reasonings for wanting to be long on some stocks and short on others... And those short choices were generally fairly popular stocks. Upon publishing those articles, people who were on the opposite sides of the position that I was recommending would comment, but the discussion would be in a calm, rational manner, in other words, nothing at all like what greets people here who share less than favorable opinions.
Just as we get attacked and abused for mentioning things that could be considered "shortcomings" of Bitcoin, overall, the community just doesn't want to hear it. 
Way too much emotion is involved right now.

China didn't outlaw Bitcoin; citizens there are free to buy and trade it, they just moved to prevent banks from investing their reserved in it
Look back at the price history, what happened from Oct to Dec 2013 was not a "natural" price movement - it had all the indications of being a spike where prices wouldn't be able to sustain themselves. 
So no, I don't think that China is to blame for spoiling the party...

Their supercomputer wouldn't cause a hiccup to the Bitcoin network. 
The government, could, though, build and deploy thousands or even million miners to 51% the network and bury it deep in the budget.
 If they decided to go all out against Bitcoin, itd be a very easy target to take down. Likewise, any other country, especially one of the "rogue nations" that the U.S. doesn't like, would have to be crazy to adopts Bitcoin as their national currency.
Right now, economic warfare consists of things like sanctions, etc; imagine the damage that. Would be caused if any country &lt;or group if countries&gt;?could press a button, fire up the miners, and prevent any and every transaction taking places in the target country. At all.

That's scary... Already, most in the bitcoin community have close to no diversification... They own Bitcoins and only bitcoins. No bonds. No stocks. Only Bitcoins... 
Should there be  a wipeout, people COULD take solace in the fact that, while they lost their savings, at least their retirements weren't wiped out.
Now that there are exchange traded Bitcoin investments coming to market, the possibility that people could shift the entirety of their retirements into Bitcoin, well, that's just scary. Sure, if bitcoin goes up, they do great. But if plummets. Wow. There''ll be thousands upon thousands of people with their savings AND retirements blown to shreds...
My advice, not that anyone will take it, and more likely i'll just be ridiculed, is to maintain diversification in your retirement accounts... Want to add some bitcoin? Sure, allocate 5 or 10%. Just don't be so blinded and enamored by your investment that you put your retirement at risk... All eggs in one basket is rarely a good investment strategy. Sure, you could win big time. But the severity of the potential loss, no matter how remote that possibility is, should cause you to rethink that strategy.

Hardware wallets and paper and seed backuos might be fine for you. But for the average citizen, far too complex. Likewise, most people don't want to be their own banks. Not is it appropriate for them to be their own banks with crypto currency , where thefts are irreversible. 
Just as people didn't want to be their own banks when and hold their own gold a couple centuries ago, same goes for btc. Much better to leave it with an institution that can not only protect it, but who has has reserves to replace those funds if they're stolen
And peer to peer lending is a thing, I recognize that. But it's increidbly inefficient compared with centralizrd lending. A peer to peer mortgage might require thousands of people to do due diligence, where a bank has a small committee that can do he sam thing. 
I have to imagine that if btc takes over, it'll resembl gold. People storing bitcoins with banks. Banks or even cental governments issuing paper representations of those coins so thAt people can transact in places where Internet isn't avaioable. Not to mention people who will prefer paper for its superior privacy compared to transacting on the blockchAIN
NONE of that is bAd for bitcoin, I don't think. It just accounts for people's short comings - like most of the population will not be able to adequately secure their coins. Would they rather trust a little device to do it, where they have no recourse in the event of failure or if the device itself gets stolen? Or would they feel more comfortable leaving their coins with an institution that's dedicated to keeping their coins safe, and who has the means to make them whole in the event of failure?

LN represents a HUGE radical change from the Bitcoin we all know. Besides which, it's not yet released, and there is no indication of how much uptake it will actually see once it is released. 
And even if LN does eventually take over, what is wrong with a few intermediate steps to address scalability before LN is in the spotlight?
Should we have held off from upgrading from 16 to 32 bit processors and operating systems, because 64-bit systems would eventually be available? No? Then why hold back bitcoin due to the hope one new technology might have, with no indication of when it will be available or when it will have enough uptake to actually be usable?

your chips would burn themselves out rapidly, since they couldn't dissipate heat. Plus you'd need custom ones that could put up with radiation and solar bombardment. Not to mention the cost of launching your rig into space, which would dwarf the cost of the rigs and panels themselves.

Who knows if he was trading, cashing out or just playing around with MtGox to see how something big in the ecosystem operated?
There was no such thing a core developers back then. Contributors. And doing a deal with one of them would require him to tell them who he was, which would put an end to staying hidden, at least having to trust that one developer wouldn't out him. 
Keep in mind just before Gox shut down bitcoins were worth $1000. So even the 14 he lost weren't chump change. Maybe not to someone with a billion dollar fortune, we only know what he lost not sold. Maybe he needed a new car, cashed some out and simply forgot the rest. 
If he wanted to maintain anonymity, he'd certainly do that, sell coins from the latest blocks he'd mined under his real name rather than from the earliest stash. 
So no. There are reasons to disbelieve, yes. But not at all for the reasons you're giving.

No, you're misreading him  
He doesn't say that he's just an average person and any one could do what he did. he says that he's uniquely wired, and had he been born 100 years earlier, before publicly traded equities, stock markets etc, or had he been born in a 3rd world country, he never would have been able to do what he did. 
He's knows he's special. And he becamr and investment manage because he loves making money. 
And he thinks the best use of his fortune is for it to be used by the gAtes foundation to help the people in the third world. That you don't think that's a good use, that's arbitrary. It's not your money after all. 
But believe me, I've read many books about him. I read his annual letter to shareholders. I've read the letters he sent to his investors when he ran investment partnerships rather than Berkshire. And I've attended one of his annual meetings with shareholders. 
Not like I know the guy, but I've spent a bit of time studying him. And everything you say is just so far off the mark. 
Even your bit about charities is baffling. 
Spending money to cure aging? Maybe that's your priority, not his
Contributing it toward a mission to Mars? All of his funds would be expended after a couple missions with no guarantee of a complaining anything. 
And to me, those both sound like charitable endeavors, just ones that suit your desires rather than what he thinks the priority should be. 
For a long time, he was going to give his wealth to Foundation in his own name. But a few years ago, he determines thT the Gates foundation would be able to do far more good  with his funds. 
Really, I don't know where you get your information. I'm tending to be hunk you're just making it up on the spot. But it's so far off the mark compared to reality. 
"Hes giving to charity to try to cure diseases thAt kill millions because he hates his wealth. If he loved his money's, he'd give his wealth to charities thT would try to cure aging or send people to other planets". That logic escapes me.

No offense, but I get sick of people bringing up game theory. It doesn't apply. For instance there is nothing to suggest that a firm that holds $100 billion in assets attached to the blockchain would choose not to invest anything to protect it themselves. Nothing at all. Maybe us little people could rely on the arms race between the large interests keeping one another in check to hold our own assets there for negligible fee or effort, but to suggest that "game theory suggests" that firms would essentially abandon their assets, hope others would protect them, that makes the least sense.

Yes, point being that all of the "experts" only pointed to higher prices rather than dare say "you know, it might be overvalued"
But yes, Bitcoin will continue to be as volatile as ever. I don't think that Wall Street should be viewed as any sort of panacea - the big money types aren't waiting for ETFs, as one of the first things they'ed note when doing their due diligence is that they must control their private key. So it's not like they're saying "if only we could buy bitcoins, when will that etf be launched?"
Besides, we can't look to them for stability. Remember the financial crisis we just had? That was one of wall streets creation. 
Average joes and janes might try buying some shares of the rtf, but they move in herds - so long as it's stable or going up, they'll stuck around, but a few sharp moves down and they'll sell out and never look back.

The size of the US economy is based on the amount of spending, not the total amount of dollars. A single dollar can and is often spent numerous times throughout the year. 
So, the "Bitcoin Economy" could be worth, say, 50 billion dollars, while the market cap of all existing bitcoins could be worth a fraction of that, if they were spent rapidly. It depends on the velocity of money.

Lots of things.
What if they transfer the coins to an exchange which promptly pulls a Mt Gox?
What if they sell them at exchange A and sometime after the fact citizens complain that if they had sold them at exchange B, they would have fetched a better price?
Or, since someone would then have the power to choose the exchange, they could then say "hey, do you want liquidity? What if i give you these coins to sell, and you kick back a few thousand dollars to me in exchange?
There's just too many things that could go wrong or cause headaches after the fact. Same reason governments sell everything else they confiscate at auction rather than craigslist or what not.
Sure, they might not fetch the same price as if they sold the coins piecemeal over days weeks or months, but at the end of the day, no one can complain, the coins will have been sold according to the established procedure for all other confiscated property.

Just a 16 nm miner humming away next to a 14nm miner, that's all.

It's not trading yet. When it does open, it'll be close to that value (or 1/10th of wherever a bitcoin is worth).
Less 3% or so (the administrator charges a 2% annual administration fee, and the fund has been open for a year and a half, so each share will have paid 3% of its assets in administration fees.
There will probably be further discounting due to the fact that fund shares aren't exchangable for Bitcoins. And possibly more due do the outside risk that someone nabs the private key and gets away with the underlying assets.
All in all, if shares of the fund open trading at 90% of the value of 1/10th of a Bitcoin, sure, it'll look like a good deal on the surface, but bear in mind that, not being an ETF, there isn't an aribrage mechanism to keep the funds' shares pinned at close to 1/10th the value of bitcoin (less administrative fees that have been paid to date).

It's always been that depositors are creditors of banks. 
FDIC coverage is $250k per person per bank; yes, the fdic only has a small fraction of the assets in the banking system, but that's the norm for insurance. No insurer carries enough cash to cover all their policies being collected at once. 
For a time, during the crisis, the fdic offered 100% coverage for non-interest bearing deposits.  A paper promise, yes, but they had enough credibility with that promise so that big depositors didn't storm the banks to pull their money out
I notice a lot of people here especially seem to think we're still in late 2008 early 2009; yes, it was a traumatic event, but we made it through. It's 2015 now, it's time to realize we're not in the midst of what was probably a once in a lifetime crisis

Sounds like a trust company. 
You'll need to charge your customers to hold their deposits  
Is this a smart business plan?
"Hmmm. I could go to bank A, get fdic coverage and earn some Interest on my money or go to bank B, earn zero, get no FDIC coverage and I get to pay them for the privilege of keeping my money, who should  I choose?"
It's really weird to me how people are all freaked out that banks happen to loan out funds, and that those funds are customer deposits; yes, doing so prevents all of the banks customers from withdrawing at the same time, but the fact is, they don't do that, except in really weird circumstances, which are now mostly closed off due to the FDIC. And generally, average customer balances go up as time goes by, meaning there is money that would just be sitting idle thTs able be be lent out for whTevet, business lines of credit, auto loans, eye...
But best of luck with your bank and trying to attract any deposits. What happens if you're robbed? Or a fire starts?  Again, what purpose would you foll in taking deposits, charging for it, and being unable to provide any protections at all; people would be better off just stashing their funds under their mattresses, and it'd cost them less. 
Regular bank account, might earn interest to try to keep up with inflation. In fact, in "normal" times interest rates surpass the rate of inflation. 
Cash at home, earns zero, gets inflated away over time. 
Or bank with you, not only get inflated away, but gets eaten away by fees on top of that...

Recognize that, should Bitcoin ever become truly mass adopted, the vast majority of people will be ill-Equipped to secure their coins themselves. Heck, a number of us "early adopters" have problems. So wallet services are in the future, should a mass adoption occur. 
And best that they take their systems down from time to time in order to address any security concerns they have (not that I'm accusing Curcle of that) than keep their systems up and vulnerable to appease the few that might try to raise and uproar if they're denied their coins for a few minutes. 
Which would you rather?
Or do you seriously think that most of today's users, let alone the millions upon millions of people we hope will adopt bitcoin tomorrow, are capable of holding their funds securely?

Even then, you have to have a tremendous amount of trust in the manufacturer of the device itself; how do you know that the private keys it generates are unique or not based on a seed that is known to the creator or any of it's developers, any of whom could lie in wait for years. Open source software is auditable, not so with hardware. You can look at the schematics and still have no idea if additional logic is present in the chips that isnt reflected in the source you're examining. Then you wake up and your savings are irrevocably gone. 
Likewise, easier to use software can be crafted, but no matter how you simplify it, the private key will have to be decrypted and present in memory in order to sign and effect transactions. And knowing of the millions of PCs infested with malware or parts of botnets, those users will be bankrupt in no time. 
You CANT underestimate the difficulties and hiccups that will occur if Bitcoin was the dominany currency because their effects will be catastrophic to those on the receiving end. Far far different than mo3 players, cell phones and even online banking. You really owe it to yourself and everyone else to think things through from both an idiots standpoint AND a malicious actors standpoint, and not just assume things will magically work out. 
For most, middle manning is going to be the best solution should Bitcoin take hold, just as it is with dollars. The vast majority of people are unwilling to take the risk of holding their life savings in a safe in their house, and instead prefer the protections offered by the middleman, insurance, signatures on checks, etc. it's notbperfect, but an improvement over the risk of holding their funds themselves.
There will also be both the people who want see their money earn interest, and those that want or need to borrow to cover a cost they can't adford making up front. It's reality, whether we transact in dollars or bitcoins, lending and therefore banks likely aren't going away. 
I'd go further to say that the mess we just saw ourselves get in wasn't the result of dollars. Sure, you could lay blame in fractional reserve, but that will occur in Bitcoin denominated banks just as it does with dollar denominated ones. I'd say the real cause if the crisis was lack of regulation, which let banks and employees take on outsized risks; hand reserve ratios been mandated to be higher, not nearly as much money could have flooded into the housing market. But, many bitcoiners look to their currency to do away with goverrnt and regulation - I think that would have disastrous consequences, which you can already see today - BS&amp;T (pirateat40), and tons of other scams, the latest being Friedcat and ASICMINER show that we unfortunately live in a world where, if people think there's no one able to enforce consequences for fraudulent behavior, then the world is their victim. It might even be a small minority, but that's all it takes to ruin tons of people's lives.

@_date: 2016-05-02 20:24:19
AFAIK, if he got the private key to the genesis block, he wouldn't be able to spend those coins - they will forever be locked to that address.
The private key resulting from awards from solving block 2 and beyond would be spendable, though. The reward from each solved  block goes to its own address, and Satoshi didn't move all of his coins to a single address - so obtaining a single private key would only result in being able to spend 50 BTC out of what's presumed to be Satoshi's stash, not the whole thing.
Which is why no one really knows how many Bitcoins satoshi has -they're scattered amongst so many of the early blocks, and its assumed that most of those are his. There's not one pile that is observable to be "definitely" satoshi's

Wallet services suck. Period. Why anyone would leave their coins under someone else's control for anything but a minimal amount of time is beyond me, especially with lightweight clients like electrum. 
But, given the experience of operators holding other people's coins, I'm much inclined to use a regulated entity to make such purchases. If someone wants to link to my bank account and have control of my coins for any period, I want to know who they are, know they haven't been a fraudster or theif in the past, and have the financial footing to operate without dipping into my coins

No - if you borrow from Chase, they're allowed to loan out 90% of the funds they have on deposit. They don't take those funds on deposit and multiply it to create new money.
Fractional reserve, the term people get hung up about here, means that they only need to keep a fraction of their reserves on hand. Whole reserve banking, should it ever exist, would mean that a bank would only be able to loan out of its own funds, not from its depositors funds.

Even a year ago, if you saw a transaction pending, it would generally be confirmed in a short time period. Now, that's hardly the case. You can see the transaction, but who knows, maybe the fee wasn't high enough so the network will drop it without confirming it. Or maybe it's replaceable.

What diseconomies of scale are you referring to?
Scaling up a mining farm is a linear process, and the more hashing power you own relative to the rest of the network, the more you'll earn. The more you earn, the more money you can reinvest. And the greater volume of hardware you're buying, the greater discount you can get from the manufacturer. Do enough buying, you can contract directly with the fabs. It's all a straight forward process. Where exactly does the "diseconomy" kick in?
In hindsight, I think Bitcoin would have been much better served by thinking out an algorithm that MIGHT have changed kept this at bay. Something to keep it from getting etched in silicon, whether it's  alterations on the SHA2 hashing itself (SHA2-256, SHA-128, SHA-512, alternating), or even shifting proofs of work altogether (for blocks 1-X, SHA256, blocks X-Y, XXXXX), etc. 
I got interested in Bitcoin back when anyone could mine. Just missed out on CPU mining, really... (well no, I didn't, but when I was CPU mining, I was getting payouts of 0.03 or so BTC, but Bitcoin was only worth single digits so it didn't seem worth it).
That said, even though Bitcoin hopes to be a trustless currency, I currently have trust in the miners more or less. And unfortunately, you have to. Two groups COULD collude and make some coins unspendable, its just how it works. 
So why am I interested? I think it's a great experiment. I have no idea how well the idea will work out. But it stands to reason that the world could use an alternative currency, an internet currency.
Decentralization as a concept seems cool, but I fear that there are huge sacrifices being made in the name of decentralization that won't have much effect on the outcome.
Case in point, people lament the decline in the number of nodes. Many point to storage requirements. Sure, that could be true, but the fact of the matter is that I only ever ran a full node because I HAD to. Once an option opened up (in my case Electrum), I moved to that. I suspect that's the biggest driver of the decline in nodes, people never wanting to be a part of the network, especially once mining slipped out of reach of regular people. They just wanted to obtain, invest, or spend Bitcoins, etc. Just like I have a debit card, but I don't expect to be a part of Visa or Mastercards network.
Maybe I'm wrong for sticking around. I think there are some uses to Bitcoin that make it useful, so long as we can trust the big players (whether it's miners, node operators or developers). I don't think its possible to build a system that relies on trusting nobody - a few dishonest players ruin things, just as a few bad apples ruin the basket. So far the vast majority has been trustable - that's what's kept Bitcoin going, IMO, not its trustlessness.

An ETN is nothing like an ETF, and doesn't save the Winklevoss Twins' dream not help anyone actually gain access to Bitcoin in their portfolios.
    ETNs are not held to the same standards as typical ETFs since they are unsecured debt obligations, or a promise to pay the holder of the ETN the total return of an index (in this case the "Winkdex," as seen in the chart below) on a set maturity date, which is typically 30 years in the future. 
Yes - ETN's are just promises to pay. You buy your ETN and trade it around as much as you'd like. But the Notes value isn't based on its underlying holdings, but only the issuers ability to eventually redeem those notes for their stated value at some point in the future.
It should all work fine on paper, but that's all it is, a promise to pay. If winkelvoss assets goes belly up, there goes your note. If they get sued and have to cash in their pile of bitcoins to settle, there goes your note. Contrast that with an ETF, which is essentially proportionate ownership of the underlying assets themselves.

It would get dicey if the site went down while buyer and seller were having a dispute. They'ed be forced to either reach a resolution that suited the both of them, or see neither of them receive any coins;

Too bad there can't be a study. I wonder what percentage of funds deposited to DNMs have been absconded with, either due to theft by the operator, exit scam by a vendor, or seizure by law enforcement. I'm certain the amount is far from trivial, even on a percentage basis.

Bitcoin is 100 times more unforgiving than online banking. One misstep and all of the coins you've worked hard for are gone without a trace. Misstep with fiat? You might lose some dollars permanently, but many banks will reimburse your losses. They also are on the lookout for out of character spending. Worst case, the funds are gone, but you know who received them
Even if you choose the wrong institution and it goes belly up, the fdic will make surethat you're made whole, so long as your loss is less than $250k, which is the vast majority of the public 
It's completely underestimating the risks to attempts to draw parallels between online banking and self managed Bitcoin wallets, or even wallet services and exchanges. 
Or do you expect the general public will start printing paper wallets and burying their savings in the back yard it under the mattress. 
You can't underestimate the difficulties that Bitcoin poses to the neophytes/general public. Doesn't mean that it's doomed and has no future, but just that it will not and should not be the currency for the world, but instead to those who can hold it securely or who need it for special use cases

This sort of rhetoric is not helpful.

I think it has a role as an adjunct to what we already have; a low cost means to transferring value, with transacting still mainly being done with things that offer consumer protections, charge backs and the like;  whether it's butterfly labs collecting bitcoins from customers who are then held hostage conpared to other purchasers who could charge back since they paid with credit or PayPal, or the numerous thefts and other fraudulent events, I think it's an unfortunate fact that we need protections, especially when buying things, sight unseen from people or businesses we don't know. 
As for the main part of my comment. It's one thing when the Ceo of a Bitcoin company, or the winkleviss twins, sponsors of the Bitcoin etf, sing praises for how high Bitcoin will fly. It's in their vested interest if course they won't predict anything lower than the max. Just like a football game, no matter how bad they're getting beaten, a teams cheerleaders will always cheer as if they're number one. Do we gauge the future performance of football teams based on how excited they're cheerleaders appear? No. That's why the CEO of a Bitcoin related conpany who we've never heard of before saying great things about bitcoins future is equally uninteresting to me.

I understand the concept of securely holding coins, myself personally. But given the number of thefts we see here, bitcointalk, etc, clearly lots of people, early adopters no less, fail to be able to secure their own holdings.
If our own early adopters can't hold their coins securely, what do we think will happen when/if the average joes start using it? Let alone people like my mom. Or the millions of people whose computers have been compromised and send send spam all day long...
I'm sorry, I don't think that any of that "class" of users stands a chance at being able to hold Bitcoin securely. Which means they'ed have to rely on others, "banks", wallets or exchanges, to hold their coins for them. Which we all also no is not a good thing - the first response to any user complaining about losing their coins to an exchange hack is "why did you store your coins at the exchange? Don't you know that if you don't control your private key you don't own your coins?"

Financial logic is driven by behavior. If you have 10,000 Bitcoins and need $1,000 logic would dictate that you don't need to transfer all 10,000 coins to an exchange. And logic also states that if if you need $1,000 and the person you need to give it to won't accept Bitcoin, then the fact that you have 10,000 of them is irrelevant - you could have 1,000,000 bitcoins and still need to give them ten $100 bills.

Seriously, why do people think that Bitcoin is remotely useful to those without computers. It isn't.

I would only say that, as much as you layer on top of the protocol, if there exists a way for someone with nefarious motives to obtain your private key, your coins are gone... 
The device you dream of to enable average people to securely handle bitcoins is... well... a dream.
There is no such thing as provably secure; there could be a flaw in the programming, in the implementation, in the hardware it runs on, but rest assured, the more complicated you build something, the more likely a flaw will be found in it.
Especially once you have that software running on something as complex as a smartphone, there's little doubt in my mind that it a flaw would be found and exploited at some point.
Bitcoin is a new paradigm that average users have no experience with, and its absolutely unforgiving, and its open to all sorts of attacks that aren't as widely feasible in the current system. 
You give me your checkbook, for instance, and I would have to be stupid to write a check and deposit it to my account; once you see that funds are missing from your account and bring it to the banks' or police departments attention, and they can furnish you with all of the details of the person whose account that check was deposited to. Bitcoin? Yes, it can be obious that coins were transferred out of your wallet, but discovering who owns or controls the address on the receiving side can be next to impossible. 
(yes, dumb criminals forge checks nowadays, but they are easily caught)
Point is, securing Bitcoin is a non-trivial task. Buzzwords like "provably secure" and "biometric security" are just those - buzzwords. Bitcoins recent history (which is all that's available) is replete with examples of huge losses occurring without attribution as to who executed them. Exchanges have been wiped out time and time again. User wallets. And so forth.
Bitcoin or one of its descendants likely has a future, yes, but I don't think that future is one where its handled by the "masses". Or at least I hope it isn't... Or else we will hear story after story of people life savings being swept away.

Hindsight being 20/20 it sure would have been wiser to admit ownership of the servers and then fight every piece of evidence introduced as a result of hacking them, rather than disclaim ownership by saying "our client only set up and administered the site for the first few months, but then handed it off to someone else"...

They investigated Karpeles because they had no idea who else to investigate, and he was a high profile member of the bitcoin community. Not to mention, he was in a unique position to be able to launder bitcoins. But once Ulbricbht appeared on their radar, they lost interest in Karpeles almost immediately.
And his discussion with the Feds wasn't asking for immunity for anything related to him being involved with Silkroad. He was seeking immunity for running an unlicensed money transfer business (the feds had recently seized several of Gox's US bank accounts), and was offering that he had an idea of which Gox account holder might be DPR.

Society is governed by laws. Right now, property deeds are stored in books at town halls. Vehicle ownership is evidenced by owning the piece of paper that is the cars title. We're fine with this because we have laws that recognize these in disputes. If laws were updated to say that you could transfer your deed or car title into the blockchain, and it would still be forever yours unless you chose to release it to someone else, that's all that's needed. 
Now, if a totalitarian comes into power, sure they could disregard the property records or car titles and confiscate whatever they please to, blockchain or not. So that's immaterial. You could also cite the risk of a meteor destroying the records repository or whatever else, point is of society collapses, it collapses. Any systems we've made will cease working.

In this context, the buyer needs to trust that the product he is buying from the seller will perform to his expectations and Uf not, that the seller will agree to requests for refunds or exchanges. Sometimes, that's more difficult that it should be in the fiat workd, with only the threat of a chargeback making a merchant do the right thing. And that's in person; ordering online (where more and more commerce takes place) requires the above, plus trust in the seller to actually ship/deliver the product ordered, the shipping company to deliver it without theft or damage. 
And I would dare say that those scenarios are more common that a merchant double or mis- charging intentionally, because doing either of those with even a little regularity will see their merchant accounts get shut down.

No. Because the fundamental risks of things like your prhvAfe key being stolen can't be abstracted away. With the amount of theft online already, at least in fiat workd with banks and credit cards, consumers aren't forced to absorb the whole loss themselves. Well, they do in terms of fees that are passed along to them, but most will say they'ed rather pay a monthly fee and have the protections the fiat system gives them. Or actually they do say, they vote with their dollars, and nearly everyone stores their dollars in banks rather than under the mattress. 
People ridicule me when I say that should btc really take off and become the mainstream currency, the workdcwill look remarkably similar to how it does now, with banks and everything. Most are incapable of storing their coins securely. And they always will be. 
Just look at the amount of spam out there. That's from people who can't secure their computers. Right now thetre used to send junk mail, but rest assured, if real value was stored on computers, it would disappear too. 
You can't fix that in future versions of Bitcoin. That will happen specifically because Bitcoin operates the way it was designed to.  It'll always consist of public addresses and private keys. And those private keys will have to be held by people who choose passwords like "password" "password1" or "mustang". People whose computers are riddled with virus'. 
Doesn't stop bitcoin from having a place in the future, but when drawing your roadmap, you have to understand people's failings. Bitcoin is far more difficult than online banking. Even more so than cellphones. It just can't work for the public at large. Doesn't mean it can't be used by some to transfer value, or be a niche, electronic, border less currency. But to wish it on the public, you need to take off the rosey glasses and stop being an optimist, rather look at it critically and ask yourself "what could go wrong here?", because, as history shows us, what can go wrong probably will.

I love when people use their own experience, at one snapshot in time, to draw conclusions. 
Depending on the time, you could have been transacting during a lull. And more importantly, simply because your transactions made it into the blockchain means nothing for the people whose transactions didn't. Of course, had they bumped their fees to 4 cents, then you would have been the one delayed, and likely not posting about your "triumph". 
Take a step back from your own experience, look at the blocksizes being constantly filled to capacity and tell us how that's a good thing, not just for you, but thousands of other people who would like to transact on a timely way? Knowing that, if they could, if Bitcoin could handle it, it's utility would likely increase, and so, it's value too.

The fact that probably all 7 billion on the planet, or 99% of them, see value in the dollar and gold means that you don't need to explain what backs one or makes the other have value. It's an agreed upon social construct.
then there's bitcoin, where maybe 1 million people believe it has value, but 6,999,000,000 either don't believe it has value (or know it has value currently, but don't believe it will have long term value), haven't heard of it, or have heard of it but aren't convinced. 
Asking him to defend his side as to why should the dollar or gold have value is counterproductive. It's like arguing with a scientist that the sky shouldn't be blue. There's nothing to argue - on our planet, and absent a catastrophe of untold proportions, it is blue. Same thing

You can believe its all that, but you owe it to yourself to devote just as much time and energy thinking Bout it pragmatically. Most will agree that there are flaws, either in Bitcoin itself or in human nature as it relates to Bitcoin. 
I think that Bitcoin is a great invention and could very well become the dominant funds transfer mechanism (think replacing everything from wires to western Union) but I don't think it can replace all the different payment systems simply due to the lack of protections for buyers; questions that people don't ask when ordering things today would jump to front and center under Bitcoin, like "if I don't like it, will the vendor accept the return And refund me?", "will the vendor ship it in the first place?", the list goes on and on. 
Again, Bitcoin is a great invention. Is it *perfect* money?  Not in my mind. But then, maybe perfect money doesn't exist, because there are competing claims for perfection. What's perfect to a buyer isn't nevessarily perfect to a seller and vice versa. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 00:18:26

Unless every miner stops mining (or enough miners stop mining so as to make reaching the next block unfeasible), and so long as there is one other person that thinks there's value to bitcoin, then it would never hit $0, per se.... could go sub dollar. 
But long before that, a fall from $250 to $1 wouldn't really be all that much better than a fall from $250 to $0, would it?
I can see lots of scenarios where Bitcoin is abandoned, but since that's not the theme of this thread, I won't delve there, and just leave myself to get hated on for even saying that... But its always struck me that's its essentially the 1.0 technology, and that there will be a 2.0 one day... Just as CP/M lost to DOS, DOS was supplanted by Windows, Windows now shares its space with itself, Mac and Linux, and then iOS and Android appeared on the scene later on...

Nice! Now can 50,000 other people tip me a couple of bits, too? :)
Point is, someone just posted a story a month back saying there are just 4 million BTC addresses with funds in them. So that's tops 4 million Bitcoin holders. I know for myself I've got several addresses with coins in them, so if most everyone else is like that, that's maybe a universe of 1 million BTC owners in the entire world. 
That's a pretty small cross section of potential music fans. So, what, to the rest of the fans, do you say? "Tipping your favorite band is easy! Just open an account at coinbase, wait several days to hand it verified, read up on Bitcoin while you wait, and then send coins to this address: 1bduyder...."?
No. 
Sure, you could have a changetip option, but recognize that most fans will want to tip with something else. And really, if you want to tip, why not just buy a song for a buck? The band gets their cut, yeah, the label takes some too, but then the song gets pushed up in whichever platforms rankings so that other potential fans might become alerted to the band and song as well...
1 too few people currently own Bitcoin
2 too much of a hassle for people who don't know about bitcoib to obtain it
3 if you want to support your favorite artist there is already a means, namely, buying their music... It only costs, what, 59, 79 or 99 cents a track?
Last I looked, the streaming sites and apps make it pretty easy to buy a given song... And that seeks like the easiest way to support an artist :)

At the end of the day, I think 99% of the people here understood what I was saying; 
The address of the wallet in cold storage is not a secret, it can be shared with the admins at OKC's headquarters, and funds can be swept to that address without a trip to the bank. The only time that OKCoin's employees would need to visit the bank would be to retrieve the private key, in order to construct a transaction to send funds back to their hot wallet.
Re-reading your posts though, there is a bit of alarm. This is all rooted in my questioning of OP's "concern" that funds in cold storage could be mis-directed, and that therefore there should be a whitelist of where those coins can be sent.
I felt that they had sufficiently protected themselves against a complete wipeout by breaking their cold storage down to a series of wallets, each containing only 1,000 BTC; second I questioned the validity of the white list argument. For one, that technology doesn't exist - you can't send funds to one address (the cold storage wallet) and then limit where that wallet can send funds to. 
As you point out, maybe in the future that will be a possibility, but I think the bitcoin community would howl if such measures ever came under active consideration. Some have gone so far to say that Bitcoin would lose its fundamental value of whitelisting (and therefore, blacklisting) were to make it into Bitcoins core code. 
But anyways. I apologize for my misguided use of the words "public key" when I should have said "wallet address".
Side question, because, again, it sounds like you know more than me. You say that since the public key is derived from the private key, it has an important security value?
Based on my understanding of public key crypto, I don't see where the risk is, unless it's a risk that is unique to its implementation in Bitcoin itself; your PGP public key is meant to be shared with the world, as it is (or should be, barring any significant advances in mathematics) impossible to derive a private key simply by knowing what the public key is.
Separating the misnaming of Bitcoin address and public key, how does sharing of the public key put the private key at risk? Is there something specific to Bitcoin that could allow an attacker who possessed knowledge of an addresses public key to derive the private key from it? Because, according to the FAQ at en.bitcoin.it:
"...the cryptography is designed so that it is completely impossible to deduce someone's private key from their public one. "

Bitcoin doesn't affect them.
IT's not like suddenly one day, dollars will be worth nothing and people who forgot to exchange them for Bitcoins are SOL. As Bitcoin grows in prominence, rich people will have no problem diversifying their assets a little further and acquiring bitcoin.
But, most of the wealth of the rich isn't in cash. It's equities. Whether the companies they're invested in earn Dollars, Euros or Bitcoins, a company that was profitable and paying out dividends when it used Dollars as its base currency, that company will be profitable and paying out dividends in Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is at the lowest rung on the ladder, right next to dollars and the rest - it's a unit of account that's incredibly easy to transfer. Being that it is a currency, it won't tear down the systems built on top of currencies... 
People will still buy PC's from HP running Microsoft Windows, whether the money they earn is paid to them in Bitcoins or Dollars.
While Bitcoin could fundamentally change the nature of cash-type holdings, it won't affect the Apple's, Googles, Microsofts or McDonalds' of the world.

Errr. Not really. When you look at the percentage of bitcoins lost to theft compared to dollars, the picture looks much different. 
Even starker, how much have consumers been liable for from credit card fraud vs total credit card fraud, compared to customer btc losses vs total losses from stolen key, credentials, etc. 
No matter how you Slice or dice it, the current system is much safer for consumers than btc.  And that is compared to "early adopters" of btc, who ought to by hyper aware of security risks, etc. Then imagine what'll happen if btc goes mainstream as it is today?

The bigger takeaway is the effect of lack of inflation, actually deflation, that is occurring...
"But inflation is nowhere to be seen. The price of oil has fallen dramatically, making anything that requires fuel cheaper.

That lack of economic activity despite the cheapness of lending is exactly what is holding the economy back."

How valuable would your Bitcoin stash be if you  and everyone else knew that, at any time, a third party or a group of third parties, could add those specific coins to a black list?

2FA Secrets, that sounds like an issue.
But hashed passwords... Did Cavirtex simply run user passwords through a one-way hash, without a unique salt for each user? Or was the unique salt stored in the same table as the hashed passwords?
And how, exactly, did an older version of their database suddenly become compromised? 
Really. This stuff might be hard, but it's not rocket science. When was the last time that Citibank or Chase lost control of the database containing their users' online login credentials?
If it's not one thing it's another with Bitcoin.  Too many people missed out on mining, so instead they rush and create bitcoin related businesses instead, and unfortunately, they do it all by themselves, rather than invest in hiring people who live and breath computer security. Which should be the norm, for any future Bitcoin biz that aspires to hold other peoples money.
I'm certain that even if Bruce Schneier himself was to develop a Bitcoin Exchange or Wallet service, he wouldn't be satisfied with his own once over (or twice over, or three times) of his site, its source code, and all the possible avenues of attack that he could think of... He'd hire another set of eyes to evaluate it. And that's one of the top names in computer security. 
Meanwhile, so many other people think to themselves "this is a piece of cake!"

First off, if the average joe finds it too complicated, then yes, it's not useful for elections. Don't under think that once.
Second, what problem does blockchain voting solve? Unless the only way to cast votes and have them recorded on a blockchain is at official poling stations, then whatever advantages it might present (i'm wondering what they are), get swamped by the insecurity of e-voting... 
You say you ned to be able to prove who voted, and you need to be able to prove the total number of votes, without knowing who each voter voted for. True. And that's all technologically feasible.
Blockchain voting, and any other type of e-voting, cannot prove that someone wasn't coerced to vote in away that they didn't want to, or paid to vote in a way they wouldn't have chosen to, provided their login information to another so they could vote in their place, or had their credentials stolen and voted by someone else.
If you can solve those problems, maybe a system can be devised that would allow people to vote from home, the office or on the road. I personally don't see how that would be achievable. Achieve that, then lets talk about recording votes on the blockchain. And make sure whatever system you build is both usable by AND explainable to the Average Joe. 
Because if they have no idea how the system works, that it's just a piece of technological wizardry, then they'll likely have no confidence in the accuracy of the results.

Gdp is total spending; $1 supports far more than $1 in spending, depending on the velocity of money. 
Like when Ver talked about Bitcoin valuation in relation to oil, he acted as if each coin would only be used to buy oil once, and a new coin would be needed to buy more. So if Bitcoin eventually was used for 1% of all transactions in the US, it's value could be far lower than $8k/coin to support all those transactions.

Bitcoin is much more of a speculative asset than a currency at this point. Be truthful - just because it's got "coin" in its name, the vast majority of coins are held for investment and/or trading purposes... Once/if bitcoin takes hold as a real currency, it's value will likely become much more stable. Maybe at that point, Bitcoin lobbyists could get the IRS to reconsider how to treat minor Bitcoin-related gains... But now's not the time - it would only come across as "that bunch of nerds who are trying to undermine the US Dollar are now asking to not have to pay taxes from gains on their internet currency"... 
see the issue? :-)
Plus it's an issue of scale: People travel and must obtain currency in the nation they visit...  Not everywhere takes US Dollars. So, it they return and the $10,000 worth of foreign currency that they didn't spend happened to appreciate 2%, then that $200 gain wouldn't be taxable. Currencies don't normally make the jumps that we see in Bitcoin regularly (not withstanding the Swiss Francs one day jump recently)... Where as buying and owning bitcoin is a purely optional activity undertaken (presumably) in order to see the value of those holdings appreciate in value (generally...

I don't think that'll be the case; it's already scarce due to how it was programmed, that's the scarcity that can affect its value. Artificial scarcity, people hoarding them, won't affect the price much more than it already has (which, I think, is a lot). Big money won't value btc as is the hoarded btc don't exist because they and everyone else know that those coins can move at any moment. If the value of the remaining coins is too low for large transactions, so be it. 
A lot of people's actions with Bitcoin don't make sense to me. Well, no, they do make sense, each person is looking to their own self interest, but when so many people act in their own interest, it winds up being detrimental to their interest;  everyone wants Bitcoin to take off and be the currency of choice for many types of transactions, but by and large the majority of people are content to hold their coins and assume/hope other people will transact and show the world why they should want to use Bitcoin.

A notable idea, but I'll just play devils advocate.
The reason the big boys take such a large slice isn't because of credit card transaction fees. It's because they've reached critical mass, and have HUGE libraries available.
Because of those huge libraries, they become the primary destinations for stock photo buyers, and because of that, they can charge what they believe the market will bear.
Competition can arrive that charges less (many exist already), or give the creators a larger cut, but without having that critical mass of existing content to draw from, customers will gravitate to the big names.
And certainly the big names have exclusivity in their contracts. Photographers can't post their photo to Getty and your site and see which gets better results. Will you get enough original, quality content to sell, or will people opt to stay with the tried and true? 
There'll be resource costs, too. Storage, bandwidth. Uncompressed photos can be pretty large, say you get 10 or 20,000 photos, each being 20 MB each, you're looking at 400 GB of storage needed, backup, bandwidth, etc. And that's a pretty small photo library. Will your fee structure support that? Will your fee structure provide you with money to pay lawyers to go after infringers? 
Not saying that there's not room for another player in the industry, but just looking at what one company charges and thinking "i can do it cheaper", you need to get a handle on the entire business.
And likewise, this older story, and there's certainly more to it than we're reading on (Getty being owned by Carlyle Group has a ton of debt, that debt could have been taken out post acquisition in order to give Carlyle Investors a return), but at the end of the day, the company is (or at least was) having problems sustaining itself at its present fee structure:

That's rubbish. Even with Segwit, blocks can get filled up.
Regardless. It's a two way street. Core has a scaling idea that's somewhat more complex than a pure block size increase. And while the miners have proposed accepting segwit so long as it's accompanied by a larger block size (beyond just what segwit allows), and the core team has so far rebuffed it and said segwit only. Rather than meeting in the middle, core has caused this logjam, and now hopes enough nodes join and cause a fork to get out of it. 
Point is there's more than one party involved and they can't reach agreement. Problem could have been solved ages ago had core been willing to negotiate even one iota.

I do believe that there are plenty of victimless crimes on the books that shouldn't be there, but those are "crimes" that, even when fully executed by the perpetrator, still have no victim (say, buying and possessing marijuana....), Completely different category to call a crime victimless just because the perpetrator failed to achieve their goal.

They had over a year from his arrest to prepare for his defense. They only announced who their witnesses were a day or two before they were going to put them on the stand. The judge said she objected to their attempt to "ambush" the prosecutors.
Not like they had to disclose their strategy or the line of questions they planned to ask their witnesses (such as blockchain's Andreas Antonopoulos), but they didn't even disclose who their witnesses would be til the last second.

No. Because miners all follow the same sets of rules and can refuse to build on blocks that contain invalid spends. And nodes that aren't trying to mutate the network would refuse to relay those transactions or blocks, too.
But beyond that, it's the miners who make the rules that they follow, for the simple reason that they're the only ones that are provably expending energy and resources to do so. Spinning up nodes, whether in support of BIP148 or Unlimited, etc, is meaningless, because there is next to no expenditure required. I could go to Amazon tomorrow and fire up 100 nodes to signal 148, but would just me trying to fudge the numbers.

My takeaway was for all his boasting about being insured, it turns out he's self insured...  just through a different business that he owns and operates.
Unless there is 100% transparency of both how much money is on deposit in Xapo's systems AND how much  Xapo Insurance Limited's net assets are, it doesn't really mean all that much. When the insurance co moves forward and starts insuring other exchanges and wallets, it'll be an even bigger issue.
But really, unless you're Warren Buffett, I don't think self-insurance should be considered insurance... I mean, I could start a wallet service and set up a separate company that I call the insurer, and say that all accounts are insured, but does that really mean anything?
Plus, that the insurance is now free (rather than the 0.12% per year he initially wanted to charge), that raises more questions about his capacity to insure large amounts...  And why would Xapo Insurance Limited's investors want to put funds into an incredibly risky insurance company which has no income, just huge liability exposures? (I say incredibly risky because, aside from Xapo's security systems... which sound impressive, but to my knowledge haven't been subject to a third party audit... if he's insuring other exchanges and wallets, unless he's mandating that they all hold their customer assets as he does, then losses WILL occur. Fact of life. Fact of bitcoin that we see too often.).
What would be impressive is if he approached an external insurer. Be it a boutique insurer, one of Berkshire Hathaway's units (his chief underwriting officer is known to underwrite extremely uncommon liabilities), or even a Lloyds syndicate. Educate their underwriters enough that they can then hire competent compsec people to evaluate the enterprise and its systems thoroughly, pass that muster and have the premiums be reasonable... Then, that would be impressive.
But otherwise, it's just smoke an mirrors.... I think.

Yes... deny ownership of the servers, therefore evidence from them doesn't have a chance at being thrown out (not that it likely would have, but the judge ruled that since he claimed they weren't his, he had no reasonable expectation of privacy), then in the first week go on to admit ownership of them...

A lot of people suffer misperceptions of banks rolls in the world.
To us, yes, we use them to store money, make transfers, and pay bills. That's not their primary purpose though.
Funds transfer servies and bill payments aren't bit money centers for banks... Yes, they charge fees on wire transfers, but those don't make up much of their revenue or profit. Bill payments are a money losing service. They don't charge a penny for the service, and pay postage for checks that can't be transferred electronically.
 
Yes, the money that customers keep on deposit is important to banks - as those are the funds that they use to provide credit to other. And that is their roll, and how they make their money - providing credit. 
Lines of credit, letters of credit, auto loans or mortgages, that is where financiers and bankers make their money. And nothing about the bitcoin ecosystem stands to compete with that.
Even in the most extreme of cases, where the entire world switches to Bitcoin, banks will still have a roll to play in providing credit. If everyone on the planet holds their coins in their own wallets, then yes, Banks will have nothing to lend out. But just as banks got their start by providing safekeeping services, they would likely fill that roll for the masses in the future as well.
Doesn't matter to them whether their customers balances are in dollars, Euros or Bitcoin. Nor does it matter if their other sets of customers want to borrow Dollars, Euros or Bitcoins. A move to Bitcoin would entail just a small change to their systems overall.
So no, they're not threatened by Bitcoin. Lets stop pretending they are.

Really, this is a conspiratorial tangent. The likelihood of them trying to do that should be considered zero until shown otherwise, lest we waste too much time/energy worrying about non-existent boogeymen.

1 - The offline wallet is simply a public/private keeper. The company can send funds to the public key, but when they need to withdraw they need to go to the bank to retrieve the private key; Correct me if I'm wrong, but i don't think that there is any way that you can create a private key that can only send to a certain address?
2 - You're right, this seems odd. But given that their total loss is capped at 1,000 BTC, it's not a huge deal, I don't think, as they could pay that from their own reserves if they needed to.
3 - I think it's incredibly wise to split up their cold storage among a large number of private keys. IF they just just need to top off their online wallet, just grab a single private key from the vault and add 1,000 BTC to it. Far more straight forward, and less prone to risks, than needing to transact from a single offline wallet - send 1,000 BTC to the online wallet and send the remainder to a new offline wallet; then having to propagate that new public key to everyone who needs to be able to monitor it.  
4 - You're looking at only outflows but not inflows; I'm certain that when figuring out reserves, they set them at a level that minimizes trips to the bank. In other words, you're looking at the 3% of funds that are online, and suggest that they must regularly receive requests to withdraw 4% of their funds (or more), but not factoring in that they also receive bitcoins on a regular basis.
If you consider that bitcoin "depositors" are Coinbase probably act the same as ordinary depositors at banks, and not just that, many hold their coins for investment purposes rather than to immediately spend, turning over 3% of funds on a daily basis just seems incredibly unlikely. On average, the number of bitcoins held in their system probably increases day by day, month by month. They're not having to run to the bank every day to grab private keys to service withdrawal requests. More likely, they have their preset reserve level (lets say 10,000 BTC), and each day, they sweep the excess to a private key in their system, moving on to the next one once they've funded that key with 1,000 BTC.
I don't personally see alarm bells going off as a result of their disclosure; 
5 - Multisig seems preferable, yes. But with the two people with access to the private keys on the exact opposite sides of the planet, one will be sleeping when the others awake and vice versa. Meaning that when they do need to make transfers from cold to hot, there would be a delay while they waited for the second signatory to wake up, verify the transaction, and then add their own signature to it. And any delay in allowing coin withdrawals would be met with howls from the BTC community, who would all assume a new MTGox situation.
So in that light, multisig might not be optimal; again, they've structured it to cap their losses at 1,000 BTC, which i assume they can easily make up for from their own funds if need be; again, there are two competing goals, one is to keep customer funds safe, and two, to be able to service withdrawal requests in a timely basis. 
I don't know - I'm not nearly as alarmed as you are. I think most of their procedures make perfect sense, in fact. No reason for them to lie about it, if they didn't want their customers to know how they handled offline wallets, they simply wouldn't have published anything at all. Speculating that the CEO has sole control over their cold wallet strikes me as an attempt to spread FUD for no purpose...

Reserve banking isn't akin to printing money, it just assumes that the populace are net savers, which they are.
A bank with $1,000 in customer deposits operating under a reserve requirement of 10% would be able to loan out $900. No money is printed in that scheme. Thanks to things like the FDIC, there don't need to be bank runs by 99% of the populace - that there have been in recent past is just because of fear and misinformation, not because their money was ever at risk.
An example of a business that needs loans and not partners? How about ANY business that signs up for a line of credit rather than seeking out a new investor? I would say that businesses set up from the get go of having the understanding that they are operating as a partnership, or for the benefit of all of their stockholders, are much better suited to taking in investor money than a sole proprietor whose been doing things his way forever - that second one doesn't want to change how he does business on account of a new partner or owner, just needs some cash for whatever reason.
And yes - the buyer of the equipment is well aware of the fact that its depreciating. But lenders likely don't want to get into ownership issues, and nor do borrowers want lenders getting into ownership issues... Or else Alice might want borrow $1000 from Bob to buy Widget Maker A but Bob could say "sorry, i won't loan you $1000, but how about i rent you a widget maker instead? Only thing is, I have a deal with Widget Maker B, so that's the only equipment I'm prepared to rent you".
As for Islamic banking. Where is the success? Where are the $100 billion Islamic companies? Why is unemployment so great throughout the middle east, even in the more stable countries?

Well, most of the coins that were stolen actually belonged to drug dealers whose funds were tied up in escrow while they waited for their customers to finalize their transactions. The laws in most countries would say that they, too, were in violation. 
Should exchanges not allow the sale or conversion of coins coming in from darknet markets, on the basis that they, too are from the proceeds of criminal activity?

If your solution is to have the voter that was either bribed or coerced into voting a certain way is to have them cast a vote that negates their previous vote, then I'd say we're better off staying with a paper ballot system.
Can you imagine? Certain states have enough problems counting their votes when they're trying to determine whether a voter punched a single hole through a piece of paper. Now you're allowing a single voter multiple votes, where each subsequent vote nullifies their previous vote.
Yes, easy enough for computers to tally. But for serious elections, I rather like the most low-tech solution. I don't want the raw results of an election only reviewable or analyzable by DBA's... 
eVoting is a panacea to a variety of people for some unknown reason... But think about it just a little, and it really doesn't make sense - even Sweden's Pirate Party founder came down resoundingly against the idea, just a couple of weeks ago, when he said: 
“Voting over the internet? Would you really want 4chan to decide your next government?”
So for small, unimportant votes? Board of directors meetings, etc? Do you need the votes of 15 people recorded in the blockchain? I can't imagine why. Bigger elections? For city's, states, and federal positions? Scariest idea I can imagine, in terms of elections at least!

Further, how do you explain the the public, who has no idea of cryptography or keys or keypairs or hashes or one-way functions or seeds or nonces, that the results from this are true and accurate, compared to paper ballots which can be manually counted and recounted if necessary?
And if this is done at a voting booth... What is the advantage over the current system, viewing that the more complicated the explanation, the less trusted the public will view it? I'd further speculate that if the public doesn't understand the system, they'll be less likely to participate, and there turnouts would likely go down.

The income per year generated by Bitcoin. 
You're looking at back data, when each block reward was 25 BTC. That changed. And there could be different new outcomes.
A) Business as usual. Miners are content with 12.5 BTC rewards and nothing changes.
B) Many miners can't operate with new reward structure. Hash rate declines, slowing the time between blocks, which has a direct effect on the number of transactions per second or minute, however you want to measure. If blocks averaged 10 minutes before, and there's a long term decline in hashing power (due to miners perhaps playing chicken, seeing who will drop out before them) and we have a prolonged period of 12-15 minute blocks, that will directly impact on the number of transactions processing and amount of fees collected.
C) On the other hand, maybe the larger pools join together in an oligopoly and dictate that they will not process transactions with a fee less than X, independent of the node min_relay_fee. So, people can either send at the previous fee level and hope that one of the non-participating miners picks up their transaction in a block eventually, or else pay a much higher fee to be processed by the bigger pools. That could either:
1) Increase fee revenue, because people have no problem paying the new (higher) fees or
2) Decrease fee revenue, because people balk at paying those fees, and send fewer, less time sensitive transactions, to the smaller pools and avoid the new fee levels all together. Even if they're paying the same fee as before, that could be a net decline if those blocks only constitute 20% of the blocks being mined.
I can't make any predictions. And I think that the wisest choice is to refrain from making predictions for a few weeks (one or two difficulty adjustments) so we can actually see what the new order actually is, rather than make predictions based on a reality that no longer exists.

Stolen from exchange or wallet service where they had been stored.
Peoples coins are lost or stolen routinely, unfortunately. Creating the catch-22 that, to the purist (maybe that's too extreme of a word), if you're not in sole possession of the private key to your wallet, then your coins aren't really "yours", in their view... 
The catch is, you're supposed to hold your coins directly. But woefully few peopler (IMO) are capable of actually storing their coins in a secure manner. They're forced to either leave the coins on "deposit" with another person or entity,  or forced to hold the coins directly, knowing that they can likely be lifted from their possession at one point or another.

First off. It's not the individual banks that create money. You go in for a loan, they give you money from their other depositors, not just money they made up on the spot. That's why there are terms like reserve ratio. Second, to drive the point further home, if every bank could magically create dollars, no one would have any idea how many dollars exist, and any one bank could flood the system with new dollars causing inflation at best...
I like Bitcoin, but I'm a firm believer that if you're going to criticize something (banking), at least learn how it works.

A bitcoin business can be a red flag to an insurer, but insurers are in the business of evaluating and taking on risk if the money is right. You can't just call up and say "hey, I've got a business that hosts peoples bitcoin wallets, will you insure me?".
But if you've got $40 mil of VC funding, I'm certain that all but the biggest insurers would be happy to learn about bitcoin and its attendant risks in order to see if they could come up with a policy that would make both parties happy.
Whether a business is ethical or not is nonsense. There's no way to judge ones ethicalness in the present, only at the end of a sequence of events. I mean, I could start the most ethical of bitcoin wallet services and come up with the most absolutely perfect way to hold other peoples bitcoins, with the idea that once I've amassed $100 million in holdings, I'm flicking the switch and walking away with everything. 
As far as good security practices go... We see too often, all these exchanges and wallets that claim to have great security, well it turns out they didn't. Some even try to repay their customers using their own reserves.... Which is, essentially, self-insurance, 
Bring in an outside insurer and risk manager. They'll learn or hire expertise in the Bitcoin space, and do a thorough evaluation of the systems at play. Maybe they'll say "all looks good to us, your premium is $X per year". Or maybe they'll say, "we like most of what we see, but we won't cover you until you create a new private key for your cold storage, and divide it into 4 pieces that will be held by your 4 top officers".
Again, that's what insurers do. I was acquainted actually acquainted with the former chief underwriting officer of a small insurer, to watch how the guy though was fascinating, whether he was discussing insurance or any other topic.
To close out - if your spin-off is capitalized enough to absorb 100% of potential losses, then self insurance is fine. Because when exchanges go bust, they go bust in big ways... They don't say "hackers broke into our systems and stole coins from 25 accounts", they say "hackers emptied our cold wallet, all customers are affected". If that spin-off isn't capitalized enough to do that, then there's no point in it at all - the company could just pay out from whatever reserves it maintained.
So, no. I'm not buying this self insurance line. Especially when he isn't charging premiums, and having plans to cover other wallets and exchanges. And I'd urge anyone thinking to store their coins with Xapo to really think through that decision. Know that Xapo will present a much bigger target than any lone individual would ever be. And yes, it's fairly straight forward to securely store your coins without their assistance, rather than taking their word for it.

Mind if i I chime in and/or rebut?
1) **Secure transacting** - this is one the of the biggest pluses I see right now; knowing that someone can't double dip with my money. It also makes things like recurring payments a lot more difficult to implement. For routine bills, I'm fine with direct debit and not having to interact at all, so in that sense Bitcoin creates a challenge.
2) **bail ins** - No additional risk here, that I see. The same basic premise is in place - if you keep your dollars under a mattress, you can't be forced to bail a bank in (you also lose interest income, which used to be something, and likely will be again one day). HOWEVER - seems a huge amount of people use online wallet services and exchanges as wallets; they could absolutely be forced to "bail in" a failing exchange.
3) **Negative Interest Rates** - these are not a normal state of affairs; they're caused because the powers that be want to push people into increasing economic activity, which is likely a good thing. People are focused on the last crash, but the fact is, at least in the US, the economy has been a lot more stable as a whole since the Fed came to being and began working to stabilize the economy, rather than the 10-20 year boom/bust cycles of the 19th and earlier centuries...
Second - inflation and negative rates are, again, aberrations. And most the areas where negative rates are contemplated its due to the threat of deflation.
4) **borderless** - this ones cool for us, could wreck havoc with monetary policies in some countries, though.
5) **Irreversibility** - Yes, it's a boon to merchants. It's also a boon to dishonest merchants and thieves. It's not really a feature that spenders have been clamoring for though... "I wish i could send my money to a company, and if they refuse to ship my product or ship me something shoddy, I could have next to no recourse". Again, in Bitcoin's history, I'll point to the experience that BFL's customers received, and ask people to compare outcomes of those who bought with BTC and tried to get refunded versus credit card purchasers.
6) **deflation** - by witness of all the HODLers around here, it should be clear that deflation is not something we should strive for. If there's a major shortfall in the theory of bitcoin, I think this ones it.... Despite the simplest premise (my money gets more valuable so prices come down), deflation is actually not a good thing.
7) **Programmability** - seems cool on the surface, and apparently its needed for things like Lightning to work, but beyond that, it's use seems more theoretical.... Yes, you could time lock a transaction for 100 years. What if you die, and the recipient dies? That money is gone. With dollars and fiats, that money can be directed somewhere else. And the division of estates thing is a non-feature. The challenge with estates is in liquidating them in the first place (especially if beneficiaries dispute things, how much the asking price of a house should be, who gets what). Once all the money is in an account, its trivial to send 3 checks out.
8) **multisig** - I don't know if this is a feature that regular people clamored for, or if it was a feature born out of necessity for the way that Bitcoin operates. 
9) **bitcoin 2.0** - We'll see how these things go... All to be determined.
10) **monetary sovereignty** - This is good and bad. To non-history buffs, who just look at the last 10 years, the Fed seems completely incompetent and therefore of course we need to get away from them. Scale that back over 500 years and the economy under the Fed is a much more resilient creature.
And I'll dispute this ongoing notion that dollars are backed by nothing and worthless. Dollars have value because every single person in the world agrees that they have value. Gold is valuable because nearly every person in the world agrees its valuable. Bitcoin? Bitcoiners think it has value, but go up to that homeless guy in the earlier example, and offer him $10 USD or 1 BTC, which do you think he'll choose? Go to Afghanistan or Sudan and make the same offer to the populace. Same result. Bitcoin has value because we think it does, but it's hardly a universally accepted fact.

Because their investment thesis is something other than "let me put money into this asset in order to push up its value, so that other people can cash out"
@_date: 2015-02-12 06:19:31
Because all of their expenses are denominated in dollars for starters. As the last year has shown, unfortunately, $1,000 stored on the blockchain is not guaranteed to be worth$1,000 when you need to cash out. Yes, it could go up and that's great. But if it instead goes the other way, well, that's horrible for a business that transacts in dollars. 
Plus, as you point out, bitcoin is great for transferring sums so long as you can link up with the financial system. These companies are, unfortunately, locked out of the financial system. Without bank accounts, they can't get coinbase or circle or anything else. Sure, they could transfer the cash to their directors to buy bitcoins on their behalf, but that would certainly violate a number of regulations. Without the ability to buy coins via an exchange, these companies would be left to transact via local bitcoins, and last I looked, the markups there are absurd. 
It's easy to say "they should just go bitcoin". 
But even if you can overlook the sheer volatility of it (which is a HUGE turnoff to ordinary businesses that don't aspure to be currency traders), you then have landlords, employees, and suppliers that all want dollars, and not bitcoins.

It doesnt ruin the Bitcoin philosophy. Bitcoin is still fixed supply, irreversible, blockchain based currency. There needs to be fiat on and offramps. 
Users oughtnt be using these exchanges as their wallets if they want the rest of bitcoins advantages, such as censorship resistance, no counterparty risk, but that's on them. But plenty are content to do without those, and they've been that way long before coinbase (users lost coins that were parked at BitFloor, MtGox, etc)

Sounds like the vendors wallet was an issue as well. If you're going to accept Bitcoin, you should know how it works, and use a service that shows you pending transactions, whether they're reversible, whether the fee is high enough, etc, and not just confirmed transactions. 
Typing those caveats, it's pretty clear its not ready for in person transacting yet, especially not by the lay person. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 08:19:14
Yes, once the owner of a wallets address is identified, it's pretty easy to analyze that users activties, at least as far as they pertain to that address. The thing is, it's trivial to create a new address to move the coins to, or, more likely, 100 or 1,000 new addresses.
Without an identifier, though, it's futile, and we've seen wannabe blockchain "sleuths" waste time and energy trying to identify owners of wallets without any additional information - i recall the Sheep Marketplace heist, and the ensuing chase by a couple "community" members... They ended up doxxing people completely unrelated to that market or the theft, and chased the coins into an exchanges wallet. 
With Bitcoin, there exists no central authority to enforce requirements for things such as identification. To the lay user who relies on third-party "wallet" services and furnishes their identification, yes, coins received by or sent from their addresses are attributable.
For people that manage their own wallets, be it with the official client (Bitcoin-qt), Electrum, Armory, etc, they can create an unlimited amount of addresses, and none of them need to be registered or disclosed to any regulators or authorities.
Really, what the blockchain can do is allow authorities, plaintiffs, etc, the ability to work backwards. If they arrest the perpetrator of a scam (say, they provided their email address, or someone was able to determine their IP address), an analysis of the wallets on his/her computer can reveal the exact course that they traveled... In the case of a ponzi operator, looking at the fragment of one coin in their wallet could help determine who the investor was (say, they purchased the coins they wanted to invest with via Coinbase or Circle), and you could see ponzi payments to other "investors", before the operator took their cut.
This turned out to be a ramble... i"m sorry, it's late.
TLDR - Blockchain analysis can be a great tool to use after a suspect has been identified or arrested. But until that suspect takes an action that links his or her IRL identity to any of the wallet addresses they control, there's no sure fire way to identify the wallet owner.

The guy didn't know how to use his Bitcoin app, and OP had never seen it before. And yes, OP was using coinbase as a wallet, which also introduces an issue, since as you point out, coinbase likely batches their transactions. But hosted wallets are facts of the ecosystem, until tools get better, OP's experience shows how much more Bitcoin needs to advance on all fronts before its appropriate for this type of commerce.
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:19:42
Yeah, that's the proper way to do it. 
But the problem is, you can't count on everyone knowing to do that, so you can expect some losses in a fork scenario where both chains continue and both chains have decent amounts of value to them - the people that are aware of the risks will survive, while the people who are unaware will lose significant funds on one chain or the other, just not both.
I'm opposed to the idea of people poo-pooing other peoples losses by saying "should have known better", whether its because they were new and didn't realize that 3rd party wallets don't leave them in control of their coins, or if they haven't been educated about the unique risk a sudden fork can present in this sort of scenario, especially if both sides of the fork continue to have significant economic value.

"proper" valuation is only proper if there is demand.
If competition for block space caused wallets to increase their default fees, and that competition has fallen, then properly programmed wallets should begin lowering the fees they're willing to pay by default.
Or are you saying that all you want it to take to permanently increase fees to a higher level is for someone to send a bunch of transactions with an artificially high fee for a short period of time, til other wallets see this new fee and react with higher fees of their own?
Point is, if fees can be bid up due to competition for block space, than wallets should be able to react in the opposite when that competition lessens.

How extensive is the locking down of this going to be? I don't mine anymore, but I have no idea where the coins I buy on occasion come from. Being that probably most of the coins in the BTC economy has run through Silk Road's mixers, just as most US currency has cocaine residue on it, how precisely will they insure that coins are clean? Or what are clean addresses? With QT wallet, I can create many addresses, and register one of them as being a "clean" address-  but when sending coins out, how do i make sure that only "clean" coins are being sent out during one transaction, where another transaction can have "dirty" coins spent as well....

You have the amount that users were willing to pay when there was no pressure beyond bidding slightly over one another.
Dynamics changed today.  Revenue from block awards got cut in half. Time will tell what the result is, but I can imagine a world where many or most miners start setting minimum fees if transactions they'll include, to at least attempt to partially offset the revenue loss. 
All I'm saying is making predictions based on historic data on the exact day of a major change to the ecosystem probably isn't the best timing... Everyone needs to sit back a few days or weeks and see what happens.

You're bound to feel great about this idea when you plug rosy scenarios into your calculations (btc for $3k to 10k). Stop and ask how things will play out if you're wrong (ie, bitcoin goes down to $100, say). Not saying it will, but cover all the bases rather than just the best case scenarios. 
Would losing the growth potential of that $50k impact you horribly? What about the prospect of 10 years without adding principal to your 401k, while you repay it for an investment that went bust?
We all think and hope that bitcoins best days are ahead of it, but none of us know for a fact that that's the case. Meanwhile, you're proposing to borrow a substantial sum (even though it's a loan from yourself, repayment of that loan will drastically reduce the growth of your 401k. 
You're also missing out on the company match during that time, which is basically a guaranteed 66% return on your money.  Or, will you be able to continue saving that 6% that you were using for your match, even if it's not a tax deferred plan?
Others here are mentioning that, rather than buying the btc's outright, you just concentrate on making monthly purchases going forward. That sounds like the most prudent advice, if you ask me. Especially compared to taking a loan of 50%of your savings and plunking it all into one of the most volatile assets that can be found in a single transaction. 
This is your retirement - slow and steady can win that race, whereas losing potentially 50% and ceasing contributions for years going forward can dramatically lengthen that race. 
I'd urge you to consider less fortunate scenarios, and then ask yourself if it's a risk you feel its worth to take, instead of approaching it from the "I could triple my money in a year and a half and my biggest issue will be of paying taxes"

Mt.Gox is definetly a large part - if you can't readily convert Bitcoins to dollars, then that definetly lowers their value to people who need to convert them to dollars at the end of the transaction.
BUT... Litecoin suffers that as well, and more so, yet its stayed relatively stable compared to the dollar, and up quite a bit compared to Bitcoin... I'm almost thinking that the GPU Miners are moving from BTC to LTC and that's spurring more interest, driving LTC up since that's something that normal people can still participate in.
@_date: 2013-07-09 15:58:45
Being less liquid lowers their value. Same with any other investment - less liquid/thinnly traded stocks tend to trade to discounts to other stocks that share many of the same metrics but benefit from having a bigger market cap more volume.
It's simple - more difficulty in converting to dollars makes implies more risk, so people will be less eager to take it. 
Someone that might have sold you an item for 1 BTC when it was simple to convert BTC to USD might say to themselves "well, I'll still take bitcoins, but i might be forced to hold it longer than I'd like - if I'm going to do that, I need to be compensated for the risk that it either won't be convertable ever or that it might take a while" and therefore demand 2 or 3 BTC instead of 1 BTC.
Liquidity is incredibly important when determining valuation.

anyone relying on bitcoin without a clue about security, well, they shouldn't be using bitcoin, sorry to say. It's your responsibility as being a part of the network.
A bitcoin bank can NEVER work. Nor should they.
I'd say that anyone who wants to invest any amount of time or money in making one instead devote those resources to explaining to the community how to secure themselves instead.
How many collapses of exchanges and/or wallet services need to happen, with how many customer coins going missing, are going to have to occur before the idea that other people storing your coins is not a good idea???
Who wants to be responsible for a banking entity with tens or hundreds of millions of "dollars" on deposit, knowing that overnight you could lose all the coins that were entrusted to you, either due to shoddy coding, malicious coding, insiders, etc....
In normal times, people use banks because they're insured, they provide a return and they provide the means to pay people without needing to carry around cash everywhere (i.e., checks, wiretranfer, ACH, debit cards).
NONE of those exist in th bitcoin world. There is no FDIC coverage, nor should anyone believe that they're covered unless their vendor has a huge bond posted, along with many other things. You won't get interest, which means you'll have to pay for the privilege of having someone hold your coins for you. And if you have someones BTC address, you can send them money - you don't need to walk into a bank and request a wire, and write a check on your bank issued checkbook.
It's a new paradigm. There is zero need for banks, and a huge need for people to take responsibility for their own security. If you can't do that, don't get involved, because you will lose money. Maybe you'll be scammed, or maybe it'll be outright theft. It might not happen in a day or a month, but relying on others, ESPECIALLY in the bitcoin world, where the entire premise is that you don't need to have trust in any other party, it's a guarantee, it will happen at one point or another. Really, it's that simple.

True, and that's a cost that merchants pay. Basically each merchant kicks in a little bit towards making good in the event that any other merchant might mess up and take a bad card. Just like consumer fees and interest basically go into a pool to cover deadbeat customers as well. 
Bitcoin, while great for merchants who wish to avoid recieving fraudulent charges and charge backs offloads a ton of risk to customers. Most currently using bitcoin understand these risks and accept them. But the general public does not. Even if they nod their head and say they do , they still don't. Look at all the compromised computers, the hacked password files showing all the weak passwords in use

@_date: 2015-02-26 03:23:47
Because the person you're sending money to can spend bitcoins, right?
How about they can't - now they need to pay a fee to trade their backs back to the currency they wanted
Oh, and they need to open an account with an exchange
Wait a couple qys for verification deposits to occur 
Wait a few more days to transfer from the exchange to their bank
Ok - they've done this before, don't need to find an exchange, verify their accounts or anything. But they still have to trade their btc (at an assumed coat of 1% and wait for the funds transfer to occur
In that case, the fees are equivalent ANDY the BTC recipient needs to interact with the couns along the way, ame doesn't get instant access to their funds 
Apples to apples. It's how to compare things:)
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:32:44
sure, 2% vs 4.3% max fee... 
But if OP can't build enough margin into his or her sales to cover that, then I'd wager that he/she has other issues to address...
Without them being aware or intereted in Bitcoin, paypal (or another CC processing service) is likely their best option.
Sure, a wire MIGHT work out to being cheaper (at a $5k price... probably wouldn't be if the purchase is only $1k), being that OP would pay an international wire fee, then there'd be a foreign currency fee, then the recipient would likely be hit with an incoming wire fee...
ACH or check, definitely aren't possibilities - exchange rates could fluctuate between when the payment is sent and when the payment settles. Probably not by much, but still. Certainty disappears.
Either way, the fee is likely neglible to them... Either they pay it on their side, and then they increase their prices to accommodate that, or you pay the fee on your side, and they don't even see it... 
If you're their only customer asking for Bitcoin payments, they probably won't be too open to it... Unless, of course, one of their competitors begins accepting bitcoin and many of their customers drop them as a supplier, that might get them motivated...
Until that happens, they'll either pass the fee to you directly (by making you pay it) or indirectly (by paying it themselves, and simply adjusting their prices to accommodate that)...

Completely fair. If you want to transfer $50 in cash from yourself to someone else same day you have to look at all the fees, not just the fees of one method while ignoring all the fees on the other side. Because most people still need cash to pay their expenses, which is why you're transferring money in the first place.
Western union: go in, pay $5 and $50 is transferred, ready to be picked up. 
I don't see how bitcoin can compete. Suppose you already have bitcoins, one step in taken care of. So you send the coins to someone else's account. They then need to convert to fiat; they're looking at a wire transfer fee at minimum. 
Sorry. Western union wins over bitcoin any day. And anyone who can't acknowledge that needs to realize that the rest of the world pays their bills with fiat currency, bitcoin doesn't pay rent, buy food, bail people out of jail, or fill up a gas Tank. You can't compare only the cost of a bitcoin to bitcoin transfer to a dollar to dollar transfer, because 99/100 the bitcoin transfer will ultimately need to be converted to dollars, accruing all the fees that people say bitcoin avoids...

This might be more of a headache.
Each time I receive BTC from a mining pool, I record a deposit that day of however many satoshi's were received. So, my mining income is recorded as of the exchange rate that was in effect that day.
I think what I'm going to have to do in order to track costs (and gains/losses) is at the end of each day, buy an inventory item called Bitcoin, at a cost of 100,000,000 satoshi's. That way, the Bitcoin will enter inventory at that days cost. When I later sell the bitcoin, I'm selling at the current price, taking it out of inventory, which then creates the proceeds and cost of goods sold entries...
I do believe this will work.
I created an inventory item called Bitcoin.
If i sell a bitcoin, I first buy 1 Bitcoin for my inventory at a cost of 100,000,000 satoshi's. Quickbooks picks up the exchange rate that day to give it a USD cost. That Bitcoin then enters inventory with that cost.

Say there is only one blockchain, and I have coins on that chain. The chain then forks, and I now have coins on Chain A and Chain B. I want to buy something with my coins on Chain A, so i create and send a transaction, transferring coins from Address A (which is mine) to Address B (which is who I'm sending the coins to).
I then go to my Chain B wallet and find the coins on that address are gone from my Chain B wallet too.
That's because someone broadcast the transaction that I sent on Chain A to nodes on Chain B. The nodes have no way of knowing which chain a transaction is meant for, and the validly signed transition moving my Chain A coins is just as valid on Chain B. 
It could have been the person I sent my coins to sneaking themselves extra coins. It could have been an attacker, who just wanted to rattle confidence in the whole system and who is therefore rebroadcasting EVERY transaction one of chain to another chain.
And this can happen anytime - someone can hold their coins on both chains for years to see which one wins out - turns out both stay relevant and used, and they make a transaction on one, without moving their other coins at the same time - anyone can rebroadcast that transaction on the second chain whenever they want, and as long as those coins exist on the second chain, those coins will be moved, whether it's a second later or five years later.
Basically, if a fork were to ever happen and both sides wanted to continue to operate independent of one another, one fork would have to establish essentially a salt to get added to their transaction before signing that's only recognized by one side but not the other. Which would be very difficult, given that its all open source, the rules, salts and everything else are available to anyone to inspect at any time.

That is not an explanation at all. That's beyond laziness. It explains only how fees can rise, but provides no ability for those fees to decline if the situation becomes more relaxed.


No matter what level fee there is, there is always a possibility that someone could drop a high fee transaction into it.


Simply BS. First, isn't that the ENTIRE purpose for RBF? But even without RBF, you can look into the mempool and find out a good range of what size fee should be included, a number that can go up and down. If you're advocating a wallet that can only move fees up, may as well just bite the bullet and say fees should be 1 BTC per transaction. Or wait, maybe that's not enough. Perhaps 2 BTC.
No, that's insanity. Block space is subject to supply and demand. When an excess of supply occurs, then fees adjust accordingly.

Moving from CPU to gpu to asic made bitcoin more cost effective to attack, not less
Using cointerras announced pricing of $3/Gh, you get to. $3000 for a terrahash, $3mm for a petahash and $12mm to equal the entire hashrate of the network today. Supposing the attacker designed and contracted the manufacture of their own Asics rather than reselling them, they can probably save 20-30% that is likely cointerras profit margin. So, cost to attack today, using Asics, is in the range of $10 mil
If the bitcoin network were comprised of 100,000people (low, I'm sure) each employing a single i7 class CPU at $285 per (first listing on amazon), tothe cost would be $28,500,000, or almost Triple. And that's 100k people using a single CPU -if mining were accessible to any computer owner without any additional hardware, you'd probably see a million CPUs mining, meaning the cost to attack would approach $285 million. Ok, X out intels 50% profit margin and you're still at $140 million. 
No, I don't think Asics have done anything but rearrange the slices of the pie and suck a huge amount of capital from the community so that they can fight over the same slices they had before without all the financial outlay. 
What's even more alarming is that there's a $2+ billion economy built atop of $10 million of investment. Hardly seems like a solid, defensible foundation.

No one knows which coins are off the market or not. It'd be foolish to assume that satoshis coins will never be spent, or anyone else's for that matter. Otherwise, someone could claim they lost control of their hoard of coins, just to watch the market rise in response and then sell. 
Besides that, does anyone even know which coins are satoshi's? I understand there's a bunch of addresses from the beginning of time with 50 freshly mined bitcoins, and peoe assume they're all his? Surely he wasn't mining solo for a year before anyone else joined in?
But yes, I agree volatility is the killer. As well as the low trading volume caused by artificial restraint of supply is what's at play fir btcs Run up in price. Not artificial restraint as in the algorithm, just as in so many coins being held offline by people expecting greater gains.  When/if we get to the point where the entire coin supply can turnover in a week or less ( either by everyone exchanging coins or fewer people trading coins radiplidly, then well know what the true value of bitcoin is. Until then, it's just that the majority of holders are determined not to sell them at any price, making the few that can change hands seem that much more valuable.

Makes sense. I would warn about the spread sand volatility of bitcoin. Where you now have to deal with a few dollars missing from a wire here and there, if you accept bitcoin directly someone can send you your coins, and by the time you get to selling them, the price of bitcoin could have moved substantially. Could be up, could be down. And even if it hasn't moved at all, mt gox is showing a $5 bid/ask spread, so you're confronted with the question of "should the customer pay 2512.50? Or are you ok receiving 2487.50?"
Bit pay may solve those problems, but if you're just having people send directly to your wallet, those are definitely issues to address. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:15:24
Yes, it will. 
Until the bitcoin trust clears its regulatory hurdles, its stuck on seconmarket only for qualified investors. Your IRA is basically a sub entity of yourself, meaning it can only make investments that you're qualified to make. 
Ie, an accredited investor who can make an investment in a hedge fund can also have a hedge fund investment within their Ira. But a non-accredited investor can't hold hedge funds within a self directed Ira, even if the company serving as trustee of that Ira allows their accredited clients to hold those investments. 
You'll also encounter issues like account minimums, fees, etc. iirc the max contribution to an Ira is 5k or 5.5k per year; many company's that offer self directed iras have account minimums of $25-$50k, and annual fees of $200-500. They're also not ideal for investments with high turnover - either buying or selling -they generally charge hefty transaction fees 
To be clear, a self direct IRA is not an Ira like all of us have - we just invest at brokerages and mutual fund companies, where those companies act as the trustee. Self directed iras are different than that, an allow people to hold unusual assets in them- hedge funds, real estate, promissory notes, etc.

By that criteria, it took Bitcoin a long time to become "long term credible", and really, probably still isn't. Even though the hashing power of the Bitcoin network is huge, my bet is that a monied adversary willing to commit a only few million dollars could overtake it if that's what they set out on doing, especially as GPU miners drop out of the pools. 
Additionally, who says that an alt coin has to offer a "unique value proposition"? Just as multiple paper currencies exist, and different countries mint their own gold coins, there is room on the internet for more than one crypto-currency. That's it's viewed as an acceptable practice to attack alternative crypto-currencies in order to "protect" Bitcoin is troubling. For instance, how many Linux developer purposefully submit to code with obscure backdoors or memory leaks to Theo and the OpenBSD crew? If the mindset that the only way for Bitcoin to thrive is for it to destroy any alternatives, then the rest of the open source movement should adopt that mentality as well. No, Bitcoin should win on its own merits, not simply because it's user base is strong enough to wipe out any competition.
Though I would call myself a Bitcoiner, I'm increasingly interested in the Alt.Coins, specifically Litecoin. The scrypt algorithm seems better suited to promoting the distributed nature of the network, which was something I took to be a significant plus when I first started investigating Bitcoin. But even if it's not Litecoin that becomes a long-term alternative to Bitcoin, it's clear that any alternative crypto-currency developers should steer clear of SHA for the simple fact that they will be attacked by those spiteful enough to think that a second cryptocurrency is a threat to them. 
The ASIC "revolution" seems very troubling, in that at the rate things are going, especially in light of the ever increasing difficulty, Bitcoin is looking like it will soon be safe to call the "Friedcat trading network".

Your post didn't leave me thinking that you were talking about it in such a future context, i thought you were saying / implying that it was ready to do so now. 
That said, nothing about the price movements over the last year and two years makes me think that BTC is even close o settling down. I mean, just 6 months ago, it had completed an impressive run-up, only to shed two thirds/almost three quarters of its value.
Besides which, I can't think of a country that would want its hands tied in terms of monetary policy, which is exactly what  would happen if they backed their currency with Bitcoin/made Bitcoin their official currency.
Borrowing, for instance - they could borrow from other countries in those countries currencies, but if they wanted to spend domestically in order to spur growth, well, they couldn't. They could spend their Chinese Yuan, but  if they're embarking on a big project that would put many people on the payroll (roads and bridges, perhaps) they would face a challenge it came time to pay the workers. Some people here embrace the gold standard mantra that Ron Paul and others put out there, updating to the 21st century by using bit coins, but at the end of the day, such a system would be incredibly inflexaible, and (my opinion), i don't think much of the citizenry would like it if these theories somehow became part of the real world.
Likewise for lending. Say your country has an excess of reserves (the value of Bitcoin has skyrocketed) so they decide that they can lend some out as part of a foreign aide package. Now imagine the country that they send those coins has a change of heart for them later on. President of country B orders that Country A's bitcoins be send to an invalid address (ala BTC-E doing so when htey were trying to placate the community about some issue). Economic terrorism of the first degree.
And lastly, why would any country go with Bitcoin, when at the very least, they could issue their own national crypto currency instead? AustriaCoin, FranceCoin and the like. It would seem to make so much more sense for a country to issue theirs own coin and have their citizens turn in their paper money for it than to enter the Forex Market and attempt to buy up enough BTC so taht they can distribute them amnst  their citizenry.
Clearly, I'm bearish on this notion.... :)

How can people interested in staying at those places find them without the state finding them too? In this case, the central site won't get in trouble, they're not doing anything wrong. But all NY has to do is find the listings for bnb's in their jurisdiction and then send letters demanding tax payments.

You can't cite the amount they invested and not reference the price at the time the investment was made.

My non-educated guess is that they'll just sell them through an exchange; it's a liquid asset and they acknowledge it as such in their complaints. Auctions are for things that they can't convert to cash - cars, jewelry and the like. You never see listings at government auctions for "steel briefcase with $200,000 in cash comprised of 20 stacks of 100 $100 bills", so i doubt you'll see a listing for 36,000 Bitcoins. Even if you did, I doubt you'd find much opportunity, it would be announced in advance so i'm sure there would be enough bidders present to insure that the FBI collected close to market price.

Why should anyone want to engage you for anything related to offline/cold storage? The entire point of it is to remove some coins from the "at risk" pool. Having someone else hold your private key only seems to add that risk back in. Unless you've posted a significant bond somewhere. 
Here's an idea - advertise your services, and if any one signs up, after they give you their private key but before they put money in it, turn around and say. "You just failed the test. If I had any less scruples, I could run off with all your money and there would be nothing for you to do about it"

The Apple thing just doesnt' seem that shocking, honestly. Not because of a failure on Apple's part, though.
It sounds as if, if "they" gain physical access to the phone, they're able to install something on it to get root access to the device. Meaning, they essentially jailbreak the phone and add their software to it. Big deal. If Apple can't keep jailbreak developers out of their phones, do you really think they could keep the NSA out? 
So... if someone loses possession of their iPhone, it's game over basically. Question: does anyone out there think that Android provides a more secure experience? I mean, virus' get found in the Google Play store, because the default Android install is far too permissive...
So. Bash Apple today, but realize that the news is likely far worse for Android, whenever that gets disclosed. I'd bet Windows phone will look pretty bad, too, being that its a direct descendant of the worlds most insecure operating system.

To be clear: it doesn't have to go in any direction. And nothing but nothing has seen its value only increase over time. Further, if this action is because of a wile mania to get in which is causing a bubble, I'd ask which wold manias in history have ever ended well for the latecomer? None that I can think of. 
You might think that all the interest is from people exited about its monetary potential, I'd say that's false. Judging from stTements here and elsewhere, I don't think that a lot of people even know what they're buying at this point. I mean, a few weeks ago, poster put up a voice mail from his mom who was excited abou how much bitcoin has gone up. She had to call a service to find the value because she Didn't even have a computer to look up the price of a bitcoin with. 
Think about that. People with no computers are buying and internet only currency. Plus side is that when it comes time to panic she won't be able to sell. 
But the rest, they're chasing returns that they've seen other people get. And when those returns slow down or reverse, that money will be out of bitcoin so quickly. 
It's like dotcoms. They got started slowly, but as more people got in and more companies had their ipos, even more people got into it and excited about it. Everyone was happy and everyone patted themselves on the back for a job well done. Ultimately though, the dotcom experience was of losing money for the vast majority of the public, in that if you take the total amount invested post-IPO and the total received at the end of the crash, the totals weren't even close. Despite the stellar returns posted year after year, all the excitement and mania about those investments did nothing when the whole thing crumbled except teach people about diversification and opportunity cost.
Now, is today 1996 again, or is it 1999? Personally, I HOPE its 1996, but I fear its 1999. And every time someone says "I don't want to listen to a naysayer" or mentions someone without a Conputer who bought bitcoin, or says that "it's okay, it's a mania because people realize how great it is, the *only* direction bitcoins price *can* go is up", that makes me think we're rapidly approaching the end of the line. 
The story line sounds too familiar. The soundness of an investment has a lot more to do with just the underlying dynamics. The best idea in the world can be a steal for $10 a share, but that same no-brained of an investment can be a horrible investment at $1000. Same company, same technology, but completely different investment dynamics.

It's one thing to buy a stock for $40 per share which pays $1 in dividends annually, and see it fall to $30 per share while paying that same $1 per share in dividends. You can call it a paper loss, afterall, your cashflow is unchanged, so if you weren't planning to sell that asset immediately, it should make no difference.
For a non-cashflowing investment, I'd say that's not the right outlook. In that case, the reason you're buying it is for appreciation - a 50% loss is a 50% loss whether you realize it or not. 
Could it rebound? Potentially. But since income generation isn't a factor, you have certainly "lost" money, as that method of valuing your investment isn't available.

The government hearing made no indications that they might move to illegalize. Further, they know full well they can't thwart the use. Even if they blocked off the regular ports it uses to communicate, people could just point their wallets at tor and snake around that. Exchangers, yes , will fave a lot more regulation and probably further disclose about their customers ostensibly for tax compliance reasons, but that won't be the reason for bitcoin to fail.

The transaction gets sent to the network instantaneously, but blocks are solved every 10 minutes or so, so that's how long it will take for the first confirmation. Sometimes there are large amounts of transactions in the queue - back in August I ordered some mining hardware and kept checking blockchain.info to make sure I sent to the right address - it took an hour and a half to get a single confirmation
So, there is a certain amount of risk of doublespend attempts (where you could end up with the transaction that gets thrown out), etc. Maybe coinbase or bitpay will assume that liability for you? Doubt it, though, since they're probably not charging enough in the way of fees to cover their end if they need to reimburse for fraud attempts.
This is one of the reasons I had hoped one of the alt-coins would have gained traction - the time between blocks is just too large to make BTC viable for brick and mortar (i think). Mail order, sure... you can order and the vendor can take their sweet time before shipping without any inconvenience to you.
I recall people saying that for small transactions people should be confortable with zero confirmations - which seems odd - bitcoins architecture is built on the concept that you don't need to trust the other party to complete a transaction, only the blockchain. Yet once people accept transactions with no confirmations, they're shifting the trust back to the person, essentially saying "i believe you're good for it" with nothing to back it up.

Since it's so hyped up about being an irreversible payment form, and so much ado is made about the risk of chargebacks on other sites, it certainly seems like there's a crowd of people out there that says "hmmm, I'll show them!" and buys even a negligble amount of Bitcoin and then immediately calls for a chargeback. "Look! Free bit coins!"  
I've never heard of chargebacks being such a rampant problem until Bitcoin, and most of the chargebacks I read about now are for miniscule amounts, $5, $10 and $20 dollar chargebacks, just for a fraction of a bitcoin. 
It's silly, but I wish we as a community acted more responsibly.

I think this is the service i signed up for a while ago based on their promise on bitcointalk that new users would get from BTC's... so of course I went for it, but every time i checked my account, nothing was there. Figured if they couldn't hold themselves to that, then there was no reason to use them for anything else.
Of course, I am shocked that anyone uses any online wallet service at all... It's a daily occurence that someone posts about their account getting hacked, balances removed, etc. And it's always from hosted wallets. You never hear this from people with their own QT wallets. 
Listen people, bitcoin is peer to peer. That means you don't need businesses hosting your wallet for you - if you think that an online wallet service does you any good, you're still thinking in the context of banking websites, etc.
LEARN about how the network works before you dump your money into it - lots of people keep learning the same, expensive lessons over and over and over again....

Still, doesn't it strike you as ironic that the worst possible way to buy a bitcoin miner was by using bitcoins ? You can argue that bfl is " different " because they're "fraudsters" but those people exist in every nook and cranny of society. 
I wonder what sentiment would be among new investors if they read threads here and bitcoin talk where people exclaim relief that they used a cc to buy their miner rather than bitcoins. That and guides to calling in the Feds for help make the phenomenon appear Silly on so many levels. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:06:50
For miners - you have an income event the day you receive your Bitcoins from the pool. You also have an event when you convert to dollars, where there may be an additional gain or loss involved.
I guess my point is, I'm willing to bet that the Government is going to select a lot of people who's bank accounts have recieved funds from known Bitcoin channels to audit next year. Personally, I have no problem declaring what I'm doing and what I'm earning, so the day they knock (or, really, the day i get the letter), i want to be able to print off a ton of reports and send them back.
So, I'd consider this activity as being a mining business that sells of what it has mined on a regular basis.

Ummm. News flash:  bitcoin is not deflationary! It's monetary base has expanded far more than that evil inflationary dollar in the last 3 years. That's an inflationary currency. Guess what? Some more bitcoins just got mined out of thin air just now.  Even more will be crafted out of nothing for years to come. Once all the coins have been mined, and especially as they start getting lost or otherwise removed from circulation (not like that's provable) then it could be considered deflationary
But that 10% return you cite/hope for isn't deflation kicking in. It's speculators pushing the price up. Just like when it falls, it's speculators pushing the price down. No one serious is factoring deflation into their projected returns, because we're so far from the day that deflation actually is a reality. Till then, enjoy it for what it is, and investment return given to you be market forces and other market participants. Call it anything else, just don't use the d word when it's not even slightly applicable.

I won't buy into that. The government doesn't need to pull a fast one to get us into a new currency, just needs to mandate that it's so.    Likewise DARPA? Maybe they wanted to experiment with a public block chain or something, or create a reason to attract many minds to research how to make sha hashing faster or more energy efficient, but I don't get what theyed want an electronic currency for. 
Others have said the CIA wants it, too, and I can't figure out why theyed want the most traceable currency imaginable. Nothing like a journalist discovering a warlords address and correlating lots of transfers by the CIA to it

You paid 5 cents for the transfer. Your buddy had to pay something on the other end to convert the coins back to dollars, though. So while sending BTC rather than fiat was cheaper for you, it's likely that on the whole, the transaction was more expensive. That, or the recipient had to wait a period of days before they could actually have their hands on fiat rather than BTC. (in the US, for instance, ACH transactions are free, but th quickest they occur is overnight - there aren't same day ACH's).
To me, if I needed to send money to someone that needed it instantaneously or even same day, this western union deal is far better than Bitcoin can promise.

Well, for most investors, this represents a much more liquid product than Bitcoins themselves. 
Want out? Click a button, pay a buck (at interactive brokers), five bucks (at Think or Swim) etc, and the money's in your brokerage account, ready to deploy anywhere else. That, compared to Mt.Gox, where you can't even get a USD wire right now?
Plus, I'd suspect that holding these shares would be a LOT more secure for most investors. I assume that all the share's their trust owns are in an offline wallet somewhere, meaning they essentially can't get hacked. Compare that to most peoples computers, ESPECIALLY those who haven't had to worry about a cryptocurrency with irreversible transactions, and, yeah, there are huge security holes that the uniniated would face that they won't face buying this product.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:17:14
That is utter rubbish. 
If something is something is fundamentally flawed and a whole lot of people go and buy it, that doesn't necessarily invalidate their argument.
Tulips - should detractors have called its rise too? Said "you know, basing our entire investment economy on flowers is absurd, but first i predict that tulips will be worth 200x times more, and THEN they will crash"?
Dotcoms - should Warren Buffett and the many others who said "there's no value there" have followed up statements like that with "but having said that, I think that pets.com will reach 1,000 per share?"
Housing - John Paulson saw that the housing market was going to blow up long before everyone else. He started a fund to bet against it and for the first couple of years, was wrong-  he continually had to issue capital calls to his investors. But after a couple of years, they reaped the payday. Being convinced that housing was going to crash, was he first supposed to go long and buy into the bubble?
No. False across the board. 
I'm not actually THAT much a bear on bitcoin, but when i see statements like that, I feel we just may be entering into especially dangerous territory. If you don't want to listen to anything that's at odds with your viewpoint, well, that sounds like it could be a dangerous predicament. I own stocks, and I'm always interested in contrarian views, after all, if i only concentrate on what makes me feel good about my investment, i'm apt to be blindsided if things go sour and i'm still only listening to the cheerleaders.
It took me a long time to come around to bitcoin, i'll say that. And i'm still not thoroughly convinced. I own some bit coins, yes. Why? As a hedge against myself being completely wrong. And the return has been tremendous. 
Pragmatically, though, i ask myself at the same time - what's different today compared to 7 or 8 weeks ago that bitcoin should be worth 10x as much? I hear that China is buying it and that's why we should be excited - but then, China is in the grip of its own real estate bubble, just as we went through. So, the biggest hype for it is that a country of 1.3 billion is latching onto get rich quick ideas?
I also believe that there's an artificial scarcity that's driving bitcoin up. There's tons of people that want to buy, but more and more coins aren't available for sale. Sure makes things look good now, but that won't be the case if/when sizable holders move to exit. What will cause that is anyones guess. Will BTC reach $10,000 when they say "you know, that's good enough for me" or will it fall to $300 when they say "shit! I've made a ton of scratch, I better exit just so i'm on the sidelines until the real bottom gets here". Eitherway, if a few big holders cash out at highs, or a lot of small holders got shaken out by a fall, the market is not near liquid enough to accommodate that.
I don't know. To me, there are many warning lights, but I'm willing to have a small percentage in Bitcoin just in case I'm completely wrong. But to your point, poo-pooing someone that might be talking quite rationally only because many others are acting irrationally, that doesn't strike me as even the least bit wise. Best of luck to you, but I'd urge you to keep an open mind - history is replete with people blinded by greed, blinded by the notion that they know better, only to see it all disappear.

Too many people fail to realize that "sound money" and debt are not at all related. I can borrow $700 million dollars from you, or I can borrow 700 ounces of gold from you. Too many people seem to believe that if the dollar was backed by gold , then that would stifle government borrowing and even personal borrowing. That's just not the case. Switching to "sound money" without the political will to stop deficit spending will just mean that we owe gold,,silver, bitcoins, or whatever else we happened to have borrowed. 
Besides which, i don't even see how bitcoin can be called "sound money". I mean, when Ron Paul or any one else talks sound money concepts, they're talking about a currency backed by a hard asset. Bitcoin is not that. By any measure , bitcoin is least sound. It's backed by nothing, there's no decree that anyone must accept it. It's value is there only because a few million people accept that is valuable. 
It's a new paradigm, absolutely. It solves some perceived failings of the status quo, yes. But to call it. "Sound money" in grasping at straws I think. Though I also think that this runup were experiencing has nothing to do with anything to do with the concept of bitcoin, it's more likely than not that it's simply people chasing recent returns, rather than tens of thousands of people suddenly learning all the ins and outs of bitcoin and opting to buy it now. 
My opinion only. Certainly to be disagreed with, but a few of us must play devils advocate.

I actually have used them a little without understanding the process... Like, in June, i set up an account, did a single transfer and then promptly forgot about it!
Went back recently to sign up and realized i was there already. So i sold what little coin i had in there, which should be back in my bank tomorrow (since it's a banking holiday today, for me at least). I also set up a recurring purchase, but i'm not sure of one thing - is the purchase price the price it is at the moment I request the purchase? Or is it the price it is when my is transferred to them? I would prefer it to be the price as of the date of transfer, honestly, that way I could re-evaluate once they have the funds to determine if i still want to buy at that price point.
If it turns out that the price i get charged is the price from a week earlier, well, I will probably end up leaving the platform once campbx gets ach transfers turned on. I mean, it's impossible to trade with any clarity at all with a 7 day settlement time between trades.
Anyone have any ideas about this? Or what could be done to speed up the trade process with them?

And if they fall, they fall.... Bitcoins don't compound on their own. 
Sure, simply buying bitcoins and holding them works great when they go from pennies to $200, but as we've seen since the market top, there are moer directions for bitcoin prices to go than just up. And if you or anyone else can call what they'll do next with 100% certainty, you're a better predictor than I! Point is, in february, he had no idea what bitcoin would do. No one else did either. So he invested in generating more. Would have looked especially wise  had BTC stayed sidewise or fallen, but instead the MSM jumped on it and prices popped!

No, bitcoin being opensource only allows for the developers to institute incremental change. Anything more, and you've got a fork situation. Just imagine a changing in the hashing algorithm - even if SHA2 was found to be fatally flawed, i'd imagine you'd STILL have pushback from the ASIC crowd, who wouldn't want to abandon their sizable investment in hardware that can't be repurposed.
So, no - Bitcoin as opensource software lets people review the code to feel comfortable with it, and it makes it possible for small, incremental changes to be made. But people won't be able to institute big, sweeping changes or overhauls to the code and have it still be bitcoin. Instead, they need to go the "altcoin" route, which of course will mean that there will be non-stop "it's a scam" accusations and the potential for attacks against the network by people thinking that doing so will protect their vested interests.

It is the norm. Barely a week goes by without report of a large scale theft, and it's almost daily that people report wallet thefts. The system is plagued by dishonest operators and developers who leave gaping security holes. And it's a scamster paradise. They can steal a credit card number and know that maybe it's good for one or two usages. Or they can gain access to a bank account, but they transfers within the banking system are trackable. Steal a bitcoin? It's yours. Do to need to worry about someone canceling the cc# or stopping payment on a check. 
As the bitcoin economy grows, it's going to continue attracting all the scamsters and unscrupulous operators that aren't already Thinking up ways to profit. 
Does that mean the end of bitcoin? Probably not. But it does mean that users who want to be involved in bitcoin need to take their understanding of security to a new level. It's not just worry about your computer sending spam or your credit card getting a ton of charges that you can reverse.  And people who are  intent on evangelizing bitcoin really ought to  be telling people about the security concerns at the same time as they talk about all the pros, otherwise they're doing a tremendous disservice to those people.

See my other post; just because they show that a position has been opened is no guarantee that they have infact done so. And just because you transfer your proceeds back out is, again, no guarantee that those proceeds are the proceeds from your sale, rather it's likely just a confidence gaining maneuver.
This violates so many laws (which, I know, many people in our community scoff at), but the founders of the company are exposed to huge liabilities that they can't escape. 
Money laundering on the one hand - any licenced brokerage or exchange participant is going to have to ask questions about sizable transfers in and out of the account. Simply locating the company outside of US boundaries won't alleviate that, because the brokerage is still going to have to comply with FINRA and SEC rules.
Taxes are also a huge issue; if there is an actual brokerage account, someone is going to be liable for the taxes on the gains, interest and dividends. 
I can't believe that someone would possibly leave themselves so exposed. But they're on the Tor network, so they're not exposed at all, just as long as they don't actually transact. So long as they only take in BTC and display phony trade data, it's essentially riskless for them, since they can pull the plug at anytime and vanish without a trace. The risks only occur if they're trying to do this for real.
You're warned.

If what your'e saying is true, then why in the world to people get hung up waiting for confirmations? How come Blockchain.info waits varying times for execution of a shared transaction (i.e., they wait for 2 confirmations for transactions 250 BTC and over, 1 confirmation for 25 BTC to 249 BTC, and for 90% the transaction to be relayed by 90% of the network for smaller transactions). Why doesn't block chain just forward all transactions immediately?
The reference bitcoin client may do X, but it's open source - anyone can make changes to that client to allow them to attempt to pull something over on you. Read this thread: 
What about this?
How come developers and mining pool operators, basically everyone that seems to know about bit coins workings all say you need confirmations in order to not have problems?
Even using a "reference client"... if i have two android phones on two different carriers, or a laptop with two VPS sessions each with a different VPN so that the wallet is duplicated, arrange to buy a shirt from you, and while i'm at the register, press send on one device, and then proceed with the transaction from the other device, tell me what occurs?
Yes, credit cards allow for chargebacks into the future, but at the same time, the vendor can dispute the charge back (furnishing your signed receipt, furnishing other proof that it was you that did the spending - some venues take a copy of your drivers license as backup).

An architecture that obviates the need for people to continually dump more and more fiat currency buying hardware with no use outside the existence of bitcoins?
The first could happen. The second? No chance. Not because the network would be any less vulnerable, but because of entrenched investment. I for one think that using An algorithm so easily adopted by Asics was a flaw. So much money needs to continually be reinvested by participants for no good reason. Of course hardware developers all love this, but it serves the network no real purpose, when any well equipped attacker would have no issue amassing the resources to disrupt it, even at today's mult-petahash speed

How exactly is it better?
I mean, thieves have made a bunch of fraudulent charges, which the customers will likely only have to pay the first $50 of. Sure, Mastercard may take a hit, target may take a hit, but are you rooting for the companies or the consumers? I feel like you've got to root for the consumer, because it'll only be because of consumer demand that bitcoin could take off.
So. Consumers are more or less unaffected. Perhaps inconvenienced, but that's about all.
Now, imagine Target had accepted Bitcoin and hackers got in. Instead of getting a bunch of names and credit card numbers that are about to get cancelled, they could potentially (worst case scenario, of course) take off will ALL of Targets BTC reserves, or at least their entire hot wallet, either or which would likely be huge in comparisson to the value of the cc's that were taken.
So no, this doesnt' prove BTC's superiority. If anything, it shows that even the biggest corporations can't insure that their computers and networks are secure, and without the ability to do that, then Bitcoin is an awful idea. Or do you forget the almost daily complaints of lost bitcoin?

Short reply: No. You're wrong, that's not how it works. Your money is gone, and getting it back is not in the cards. Blame the Reagan / Bush 1 war on drugs for that one.
Medium reply: The government relies on civil forfieture laws, not criminal ones. Assets seized can (and are often) sold before trial. Basically ignoring all property rights. But unfortunately, this isn't somehting that the American people have lobbied to change, because the government always trots out the "drug war" boogie man. Follow the links below.
Longer reply:
"(Standards of Proof) "In a civil forfeiture action, the government need only prove by a preponderance of evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. Criminal forfeiture, which is apparently much less common than civil forfeiture (Hyde, 1995), usually accompanies criminal charges and is more difficult because of the proof-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard (Warchol, Payne, and Johnson, 1996:53-54). Civil forfeiture may thus be pursued more frequently because of the lower standard of proof. In fairness, however, criminal forfeiture may be preferred sometimes because restrictions exist on divulging the amount of assets forfeited (Clingermayer, Hecker, and Madsen, 2005)." - See more at: 
From another another article:
"Under civil forfeiture, everything you own can be legally taken away from you without indictment, trial, or conviction. Suspicion of offenses which, if proven, might result in a $200 fine or probation, are being used to justify seizure of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of property."

If i sell bitcoins on MtGox and request a USD wire, what are the odds that it will actually go out? Or if i buy bitcoins from them and want to transfer them to a different wallet, will that transfer occur?
These are the two recurring issues I keep hearing about with Gox, and what has prevented me from using them even though I've opened an account submitted all the stuff for KYC compliance.
Instead, I went the Virwox route for a time, and am now content to use Bitstamp. Looking forward to CampBX, though, since you can hold a dollar balance there rather than immediately transferring the funds back out.

hahaha. 
OK, i'll play.
Sure, there might be a few coins there that were associated with accounts that never bought anything.
And yes, there might be a few accounts that only ever purchased legal items that were for sale there (my understanding is that there were a few legal items here and there).
But arguing that you only went to silk road to store your bitcoins in their "safe and reputable online wallet"? I'm sorry, nobody but nobody will buy that one. Just like no one would buy the argument that "i know i could have deposited my money in bank, but Don Corleone had such a great reputation in the community that I thought it best to give my money to him to hold instead".
And again, you're mixing up criminal and civil actions as far as asset forfeiture is concerned; best look that up (i posted a couple links earlier in the thread). Basically the FBI has zero burden of proof. All they have to say is "we suspect they were associated with criminal activity" and that's more than enough justification to seize and keep the assets, per laws that have been on the book and enforced that way since the 80's.

In case Anyone's not aware, you can only buy assets through second market if you're an accredited investor. Last I knew, the rule was netwirth of $1mm (excluding primary residence)  or income of $200l / yr for the last two or three years. I'm not sure how much due diligence they do; I'd imagine a copy of your tax return and/or brokerage statement would suffice though

Not allow charge backs?
Then Paypal becomes a one stop shop for anyone with a stolen cc
Verified buyer addresses work because if an item was shipped to and signed for at that address, that's proof of delivery; same can't be said for a btc address; just because you supply it it doesn't mean that someone else hasn't got a copy of your private key and your password; someone steals some bodies PayPal credentials and their email password, that can leave Paypal open to huge amount of fraud that they'll have to eat, since credit card cos will certainly uphold their customers disputes..
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:59:07
No, it's not. Bitcoin will always be a niche for the computer savvy, and anyone who k ows about it should actively dissuade neophytes from adopting it;people can't keep their computers secure, plain and simple - bank passwords and cc numbers are stolen regularly. Thankfully banks an credit card cos provision for those losses and make their customers good. That capability doesn't exist in btc land. Therefor, if people can't keep their computer even slightly secure, they certainly should touch bitcoin. Which means its no threat to eBay at all. 
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:02:43
I guess i'm of the mindset that i'll be surprised if bitcoin is in existance 10 years from now, even more so 30 years from now. There's all sorts of technologies out there that people thought would mature and be common place (say, virtual reality... be it those headsets and gloves, VRML on the web,etc) that ultimately fizzled and disappeared, or that stayed relegated to the sidelines rather than become widely adopted. 
For one, I fail to see the benefit of a deflationary currency. There's a reason we dont' like deflation - people stop spending in hopes of gaining more and more purchasing power. Same would go here too... And what's the point of a new currency if people arent spending it?
Besides that, shortcomings in Bitcoin itself will likely be enough to prevent widespread adoption...
Confirmation time, for instance, is a killer. Far less convienent than credit cards, debit cards or cash. You can't walk into the convienence store and fill up your tank and pay with bit coins; you could be miles down the road by the time the attendant realized you attemtped a doublespend. That reason is one of the primary ones that I am a fan of the alt coins; faster transaction times are the only way a crypto currency can catch on in a widespread fashion, I think.
HOWEVER, even with faster confirmations, it's still unsuitable for the masses. Look at how much spam your get typically. Those are all coming from compromised PC's; now if people can't keep their boxes secure, they have no business putting serious money into the block chain, I don't think. Poor passwords, keyboard loggers and other trojans, easily guessed brain wallets, hacked email accounts, look at the number of people on bitcointalk that lose coins on a regular basis. And these are still the "early adopters", technologically inclined, etc. My mom? Not a chance. If she requested me to get her into bitcoin, the ONLY way I would  get her more than a couple thousand dollars worth would be if we were transfering them to a paper wallet. Let alone putting significant amounts of savings in.
Banks have their flaws, yes. But between them and the FDIC, they provide people with a safer place to store cash than people can provide for themselves (supposing you aren't deliquent on taxes, child support or anything else like that). Even with zero interest, people put their savings in the bank because they know that those funds can't be lost ($250k FDIC limit not withstanding, which is easily circumvented by opening additional accounts at other banks, buying T-Bills from Treasury Direct, or (if you have enough money) opening an account with a Trust Company which keeps your money separate from every other one of their clients and from their own funds. 
Bitcoin? Can you imagine how many coins would be lost to theft if people who can't even figure out how to turn off caps lock or change their default font from Comic Sans all of a sudden had hundreds of thousands of dollars on the blockchain? When i imagine that, what i come up with is not at all pretty...

Shoulda been that way from the start. 
0.00000100 should have been 1 BTC from the get go. The 21 million number has been a major stumbling point for many, necessitating the need to explain that 1 BTC is made up of 100,000,000 units over and over again. To my knowledge, no other currency is ordinarily dealt with is such fractions. 
So yeah good move!

If you have overdraft protection, then PayPal has no way to determine that they're taking your account below $0, and to charge your credit card instead. Turning. Off overdraft protection might not be feasible, but perhaps you could open a second no frills account to link your paypal info to?

Your example was that he was justified because failing to comply, people would spend the rest of their lives behind bars. I said that's false; yes, if disclosed it would cause in convince and hardship to them, but no one would be doing life behind bars. 
You complained about his lack of oeaceful outs. Succumbing to extortion was indeed An option that would have caused no bloodshed. He wouldn't be unique; many illegal businessss just consider that a fact of life. So to make the jump from doing a possible payoff to killing isn't as logical ad you'd mark it seem. 
And what made him jump to that level in the first place? Believing he'd already gotten away with it before. A month or two prior he contracted the killing (only paying upon successful completion, or so he thought) of a friend or acquaintance, who, yes, was guilty of stealing from him. But the idea that he could spill the beans was one that appeared in his mind with no underlying threats. Just "hmmm. Well. He got arrested, he could talk, I should have him killed just to be safe"
So, even if the first example (second occurrence) was a proportional response in your mind, the first actual occurrence doesn't give you that fall back option. Reading his writings (only the publicly available ones , not what he posted in SR), this all seems exteemely at odds with escaping the violence of the state, unless there was a follow up that 'in a true libertarian society , each member can act as just he jury and executioner to protect his perceived interests as he sees fit'
Sorry. Not buying it. I don't think that murder is a proportionate response to attempted extortion (especially when you have enough funds on hand to pay without thinking twice ) but even if you sold me on that argument, there's this stumbling block of his first ordered killing, where the extortion didn't exist. And nor did the killing. It was just thrown in as an afterthought. 
Sorry. If that's the truth , then all his hippy libertarian free love rhetoric isn't worth this bits that they were transmitted with. I challenge you to justify this rather than resort to name calling and/or insults.

It has everything to do with bitcoin's past performance, and at the very bottom, it reads "the future is not guaranteed to be like the past. The point of dollar cost averaging is to take advantage of a long term trend without as much short term risk. Dollar cost averaging during an uptrend yields less gain. Dollar cost averaging during a downtrend yields less loss".
That info graphic is very clear about what has since the inception of bitcoin, but any speculation about what bitcoin will do in the future is just that - speculation. 
I still stand by my statement-  if bitcoin had gone down rather than up, dollar cost averaging would have simply yielded less of a loss. Investing in an avalon would still enable you to dig yourself out of that hole by generating new coins.

I just said "absolutely worst case scenario". Given that many of the exchanges run by people who presumably know the risks that have been emptied out all stored their coins in one single wallet, that the FBI does, and so forth, you can't discount that a big corp might do the same.
As for consumers.... Consumers are MUCH better protected with credit cards than bitcoins. Someone steals your credit card number? Bummer, cancel it, get the fraudulent charges removed. Someone steals your wallet or breaks into your online account? Your coins are gone with zero recourse.
Besides that, why are credit cards flawed because they don't employ public key cryptography? Any reputable site you spend using your credit card employs such cryptography. Is your worry that someone will obtain some digits that you can easily replace, or that they can obtain your wallet info which, once compromised, means a complete and total loss?
Sorry, but no. Bitcoin is not appropriate for 99% of computer users out there. Every bit of spam you get is from a compromised computer - and what's the statistic? Second quarter 2013, 70% of all email sent was spam? If those computer owners held bitcoin, those coins would be long gone already. Until the public can keep their computers secure, they have no business touching bitcoin.

The NSA isn't targeting bitcoin; if anything, they're probably salivating over it - if the world did happen to move to it, the NSA would have access to a permanent store of every transaction ever made; to go along with their records of every website ever visited and every phone call ever made. 
As far as the cryptography behind bitcoin, is bet we've already seen some of the largest fallout; that android shipped with a flawed PRNG which made address collisions much more likely; every other android app using that PRNG was also flawed, which basically means every secure app... Unless the world unearths the same sort of flaw in windows, that was probably as close as they got to breaking the standard, if cryptographers who know much more than me are to be believed(which I do)

Way back when, a friend and I went 50/50 on a Jalapeño from Butterfly Labs. Such a minescule amount, yes, but i didn't know much about bitcoin then so "okay, so 50% of this jalapeño device will cost less than $100? fine..."
Fast forward to July this year, and it arrived. Tables had turned, and I was the one that had been paying more attention to the Bitcoin World. And because I'd used my card when ordering it, the Jalapeno came to me.
I asked him how he'd feel about selling it on eBay, and he rejected the idea... He was still thinking of the results we had estimated back in 2012, of a 5GH hasher, seen how much bitcoin had gone up and concluded we'd be millionaires in a few days, apparently.
I pointed out that situations had changed, and kept butting heads. Finally, unilaterally, I posted it to eBay and it sold for well over $2000. Not bad for $149. And yes, I did deliver 50% of the sale to my friend, or close to it... He wanted to retain some hashing power, so i got him a few USB block eruptors.
The point of that story is.... WOW am i glad i sold! I can't even imagine how minsucle its production would be now. For reference, when i joined Bit Minter, their total hashrate was around 5.5 TH; when my unit sold a few weeks later, it was already to 12 or 13 TH... Now it's 155 TH?
I can't believe that anyone is deploying money on mining hardware at this point...

I started out using Excel, but I thought a little extra effort setting things up might make it a lot easier down the road, so I opted to go full bore and use Quickbooks - i already have it, after all.
But yes, depreciation is definetly claimable. Electricity, too. But you need some basis to be able to determine how much electricity is being assigned to your mining operations, such as using a "kill-a-watt" device to determine usage, and then figuring out your rate each month on your power bills.
The only other steps i could think to take are establishing a separate bank account for the activity to keep all the transactions separate, and possibly form it under a business entity (S-corp or LLC). I am not a lawyer, but i assume its fine to avoid that extra expense, as I'm not really worried about being sued for Bitcoin mining, hence don't need a liability shield.
Anyone have thoughts on that?

You said he was presented with no outs, when he clearly was. Woulda cost him, yes. But chalk that up to the risk of the enterprise. 
Even if you still disagree there, alledged attempt was calling a hit on someone who simply "might" squeal. No evidence he would, or even rumors. He'd stolen some bitcoin, but DPRs justification for action was just fear of what might potentially happen
Sorry, but no. He espoused idealism, but after 2 years in, he turned into the worst of the kinds of people he could have replaced. As far as he knew, he'd ordered two executions in two months, and paid up for each of them only after recieving. "Proof" the deed was done.

No one knows what Bitcoin is going to do. Nobody. Just as no one knew what it would do in February. So, the poster went and bought Avalon equipment to generate more. Your advice and infographic work great when BTC goes from 70 to 220, but if someone followed your advice 2 moths later and bought at 220, even dollar cost averaging on the way down, they'ed have a bunch of 70 dollar coins. Whereas even if the coins lost 2/3 of their value from where he bought his Avalon, there'd still be a good chance of making back that original investment.
