Yeah, ofcourse i wont sell it.
I first discovered bitcoin at 2012 when it went up to 1300€. I then checked on it occassionaly every several months, noticed it was staying between 200-500€, kinda forgot about since a week ago. Bought at 6000€ :/

Yeah i put 470€ into bitcoins and 30€ in Ripple? 
I wont panic sell. I just have no idea if i should put more of my banksavings into Bitcoin. I do admit that at the bank its giving me olmost zero profit, with the inflation probably puts me in negative. 
I agree with most your saying except id like more info about: holding bitcoin is atleast as safe as holding money in bank. 
I do feel regret when i first checked out bitcoin when it took that increase to 1300€ several years ago that i havent bought back then. Kinda lost it out of sight till last week.

Am using bitstamp.
My first banktransfer it took 4days till my money was on bitstamp account.
My second banktransfer it took less then 36hours before i saw my money on my account. 
They dont charge when i transfer money from my bank to there website. They do charge 0.25% when i actually buy Bitcoin.
I do plan on transfering my bitcoin to a Ledger? in the future. Will i be able to transfer them from the exchange that i use to a ledger?

I made a bank transfer on sunday for 500€ when it was around 5000€, i just received the money on my account and now its 6000€ :/
Should have just used my credit card, higher tax but I would have been in profit already. 
Stupid question, should i wait or buy asap!
