What just happened here?

The analogy isn't faulty. Yes, you can still use either or. But envision I have 100 dollars, I put fifty into bitcoin. I still have 100 dollars of value, yes, I can transact in both bitcoin and dollars, but I have a temporary maximum of 50 dollars of value to spend in either bitcoin/dollars at any one time. Hence the opportunity cost of owning bitcoin.

So then, what exactly IS "perfect" monetary policy? And who, then, is it "perfect" for?

And how does bitcoins monetary policy accomplish this?

I take it you never played musical chairs.

The fact that your argument runs both ways and you don't realize it is hilarious. Intrinsically, a dollar is only a piece of fancy paper with some writing on it. Intrinsically, a gold coin is nothing more than a small piece of shiny metal. If people use it as currency, it's currency.

So, judging by this chart 1933 must have been a wonderful time to be an American....right?

Excuse me for not knowing anything about bitcoin, but wouldn't this not really change much of anything unless an absolutely massive number of people use them?
I mean, the hashing power of these things sounds pretty small, so they wouldn't mine many blocks. But a tiny value transaction doesn't have a correspondingly tiny transaction size. And if you're using tiny transactions, chances are there are an absolutely massive amount.
It just seems like there will be a giant backlog of tiny transactions and once in a long while some of them would clear.

Umm...48% of small businesses are still operating after FIVE years. Hate to burst your bubble.

You say he's lying, but don't show it. All you have to do to prove him wrong is show him a bitcoin business more than 3.5 years old, but you can't.

So, in this masturbatory fever dream of yours, why exactly did Ben Lawsky go on trial?

What was the exchange rate when you did this? Because to me it looks like you deducted the fee from the 200 pounds in the original and added it to the 200 pounds for the bitcoin example.
