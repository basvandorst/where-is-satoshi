It will not pass $1000 USD in 2016 or 2017.  If it does (and remains at or above $1000) I will be incredibly surprised.
The people regulating things on exchanges make more money when the price is lower.
Further, I'll be surprised if it breaches $2000 prior to 2018 or 2019-if at all.
The market is manipulated like a motherfucker.  Anyone who thinks that is not the case is kidding him/herself.

Well, he is shacked up in the Crypto Castle ( working on a project (self-driving cars) that is intermittently discussed as a good use case for bitcoin.

My question has nothing to do with block size increase.  My question centers around the relative few people who use exchanges.  The "legacy" financial system is rigged around the world as most of us already know.  How is valuing BTC based on the trades of a few that occur on a few exchanges a step forward?  This is is a scenario that is easily compromised and manipulated.
@_date: 2015-12-26 07:00:28
Context?  Look at past history.  The bitcoin market is manipulated more than anything I have ever seen.  The exchanges know who is doing it (or they are doing it).  If we must give all of our personal information to use an exchange, it should be trivial for them to identify who is repeatedly tanking the market, etc.
I don't really give a shit if bitcoin works or doesn't (I do think it's a cool idea/tech) but someone needs to address this.
Free market, blah, blah.  BULLSHIT.  There are a few parties manipulating it and it needs to be dealt with somehow.

OK.  Let me break to down for you since you still do not understand.  Alice and Bob are making a trade on Bitstamp.  Alice and Bob live together and are worth a couple million each.  In addition, they each have 1000 BTC.  They would like to build their nest egg so, they keep swaping back and forth, buying low, selling high.  Their neighbors, Mike and Susan, are in the same situation.  Together the 4 of them pump and dump the market with a net profit.

Yes, existing systems == legacy trading systems.
Relatively few people use exchanges however, global value is dictated by the minority which, in theory, is related to supply &amp; demand.  However, each time there is a slight increase in value there is a dump.  Looking at the data (no, I'm not going to provide anything to substantiate my claim) a relative handful of users/bots are swapping back and forth &amp; effectively dictating bitcoin monetary policy.

They removed the block on my account this morning after 3 days and suggested I try again and that should the issue recur, I'd need to do what is in your screenshot.  So, I tried a debit purchase for .1 BTC (approx. $34)...  Same thing.  Replied to them asking they cancel the transaction and indicated I'd stick with Coinbase.

What they (eBay) ultimately decide to do really won't matter once Open Bazaar is released on the world, IMHO. If the UX is similar with significantly reduced costs, eBay &amp; Paypal are, most likely, both fucked.

You also completely missed my point.  So, I will explicitly explain it for both of you. 5, 6, 7 years ago someone speaking of or suggesting a concept such as Bitcoin would have been ridiculed by both of you-and myself as well, I assume.  That is not the case any longer.  Someone figured out how to do it and solve an old problem.  Now, DNS is becoming part of the equation.  The Bitcoin network, as you know, is the most powerful specialized network in our history and it is still growing.  Dismissing the possibilities that it could be used for is myopic.  Perhaps the Blockchain technology could be leveraged either directly or indirectly to achieve things such as improved decentralized search engine functionality.  This remains to be seen.  You telling me it cannot ever happen means jack shit to me.

Option 4 is that the miners admit they invested too much money in their equipment and scale back or bow out and another player comes in.  Altering the core principles/rules of the Bitcoin protocol for these people who were not financially responsible should not be on the table for discussion.

@_date: 2014-11-21 08:03:13
While your points may very well be accurate to an extent, my question/point stands.  For example, who was the bearwhale that made headlines a few weeks back?  If an Apple shareholder dumps, it is public knowledge.   
"Someone that's trying to bring the price down artificially, by dumping into the market, if they are selling their own reserves or shorting" - MANIPULATION
"a player that wants to artificially bring the price up can be undone by another large player that dumps into him, leaving him with less fiat to push the price up." - MANIPULATION
If I must give everything short of a DNA swab to use an exchange, it should be public knowledge who is dumping or buying.
A small number of "fat kids" should not be controlling rates or prices.  These exchanges are worthless and are not much better than what we have been working with for decades.
Edit:  Just my humble opinion.

Well, if you get married and don't sell, she knows you have it...  If it goes "to the moon" she may divorce you and take it.  If it doesn't and you take a loss, etc, you still lose.

Would be funny if that "idiot" doing this, assuming the assessment to be accurate, was Satoshi...
A possibility at the other end of the spectrum is that the steady declines over the past few months were all orchestrated in preparation for today.  The rationale being that the powers that be, Wall St, etc could buy in low in preparation for something that will happen in the not-too-distant future...
Watching things for months now I have intermittently suggested market manipulation in various posts here and have been ridiculed...  Today it is far more blatant. 
I may be completely and totally off-base about the above however, it's something I've been kicking around for a while.  I have no problem admitting when I'm wrong-just trying to consider this from multiple angles.

One year ago to-the-day today, actually, I have been doing the exact same thing.
Edit:  What's annoying is I spent nearly an entire day maybe a year before trying to find a non-sketchy way to buy as I had a feeling it was going to be a big deal.  I had no interest in bank wires, or dealing with LocalBitcoin at the time.  Even MtGox seemed sketchy to me (turns out my Spidey Sense was accurate).  I threw in the towel and forgot about it until mid-November last year &amp; found Coinbase.

Yes.  You must link a bank account.  Also, as of about a month ago or so, you must provide them everything short of a DNA swab.  Previous to that, you could just link a bank account and use ACH...  That's not to say that by linking a bank account Coinbase cannot figure all of your personal information out.
It is, IMHO, a contradiction of what bitcoin is supposed to be and Coinbase, along with others, are creating central points of failure.  Thank your "masters" in the good ol' United States for regulations they must adhere to for the children, etc.

Do you have any idea how stupid this is? There is no "resistance." The market is being manipulated.
It's a big club &amp; you and I aren't in it:
@_date: 2014-06-21 00:55:32
1 BTC = 100,000,000 Satoshis
1 Satoshi = .00000001 BTC
1 BIT = 100 Satoshis
1 BTC = 1,000,000 BITS
EX:  1.98 BITS = 198 Satoshis = 1.98e-06 BTC
$1.98 = 198¢
So, same basic system the masses are accustomed to, essentially.

Anything is possible in terms of acquisition.  Coinbase would be foolish to sell or merge with PayPal and tarnish their name in the process.  There is no shortage of people with a negative opinion of PayPal be it due to fees, freezing of accounts, etc.

Edit:  There also was the "supply chain problem" that held up deliveries of the 1st batch of Trezors...  Call me a tinfoil hat person if you will...  Who would largely be buying Trezors at this point in time?  Many early adopters who have no history visible to the powers that be.  Is it unfair in light of all recent "revelations" to be skeptical?  I do not claim to be an authority on the Trezor, its hardware, etc however it does not hurt to be cautious.  Maybe I'm 3000 percent wrong.  If that is the case, so be it.  I'll err on the side of caution in this instance.

Signed up today, linked my CitiBank debit card, bought a nominal amount (0.1 at $38.72) to experience Circle's process end-to-end and zero fees imposed by Circle.  There was a nominal processing fee of  $1.12 which equates to 2.9%.
Per Circle:
What is this credit card processing fee?
Circle will never charge you to deposit, send, or receive your money. However, credit and debit card networks may charge an interchange fee for processing payments. Additionally, some issuing banks may charge a cash advance fee. Check with your issuing bank for details specific to their card.
To avoid paying third party fees, you can link a bank account.

@_date: 2014-09-24 06:30:33
Unfortunately, I partially agree with you...
The flip side to this question/argument is that if the major on-ramps (Coinbase / Circle in the US and others in other countries) receive higher buy requests, then they will need to buy more to fill demand.
Things are still at a point where a few can easily manipulate things to make a few quick dollars.  Not too long from now that will not be possible, in theory...

Depress price using strategic sells and walls, accumulate more coins at the cheaper price, then stimulate a liftoff when you're fully in position and the time is right.
This isn't rocket surgery, and the books on every exchange are thin enough to pull this off if you have enough funds and a kindergarten education.

I'm not attacking bitcoin.  I'm trying to point out that I think he is instrumental in what has happened over the past 2 weeks.  
Why would he ever want to do that?
Protip, this is not the 1st time I have implicated him.  I'm just pulling things out of my ass right now because I cannot prove it at this point.

Just make a web app.  Coinbase redesigned their mobile offering and it will provide more functionality, at this time, than anything Apple will/would approve in a "native" Coinbase app.

Fed Aims to Hasten Payments
Central Bank Says System Is Fragmented, Out of Date

WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve wants to speed up and further secure the U.S. payments system, which includes everything from checks to credit-card payments to online transactions, saying the infrastructure is fragmented and out of date.
The plan, released on Monday, calls for coordination among a broad swath of companies that help move money throughout the U.S. and internationally, from banks to credit-card networks to clearinghouses to virtual-currency firms. The central bank, which has limited authority over the broader payment system, called on private-sector firms to participate in task forces to coordinate efforts.
It also promised to speed up its own service for settling payments by slightly extending its hours of operation later this year and working to make it a 24-hour-a-day service over time.
The move comes as new technologies are upending the long-established processes for moving money. Digital currency systems, for instance, can now transfer money across the world in minutes, whereas the current U.S. system can take more than a day to process a check.
“Despite high levels of innovation in the U.S. payment system, a lack of coordination is creating fragmentation, inhibiting ubiquity and creating confusion,” said a Fed paper released Monday. “Several countries around the world have already developed or are in the process of developing a ubiquitous, faster payments capability and the United States is at risk of falling behind.”
Fed staff said the plan would help create the infrastructure for consumers to transfer money to one another in seconds, a capability that some companies provide today but isn’t possible for all transactions. The initiative has been given a high priority within the Fed, the staff said.
“A safer, more efficient and faster payment system contributes to public confidence and economic growth,” said a statement from Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell, who will be co-chairman of a Fed committee that oversees the initiative. “We look forward to working with payment stakeholders to realize this vision.”
The Fed said it wants to coordinate efforts by businesses, card networks, banks, payment processors and “emerging payment firms,” among others. Mr. Powell and Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George will start that process with a webcast outlining the Fed’s goals on Thursday.

I gave up on Circle months ago.  The day I signed up, I bought $38 bucks worth and it took all of five minutes from the time I began the signup process.  It was seamless, painless and polished.  
After that, I have not been able to make a single purchase.  Each time I contacted support, I was told they unlocked/whitelisted my account and I would try again with the same result.  After 5 times, I said screw it and just went back to Coinbase.
Also, I suggested a friend in Alberta, B.C. (I'm in the states) try Circle to get into BTC.  He provided all of his information and weeks went by with emails to support etc.  He has yet to be able to make a single purchase approx. 1.5 mos. later.
I regret that I gave them so much information for a measly $38 dollar instant purchase and then recommended them to my friend months later thinking they must have worked the kinks out after 3 months or so and few complaints in this sub (at least that I read)...  I was wrong.

In response to point 2, false.  We watched market manipulation a few days ago on a grand scale.  Kudos to whomever pulled that shit off.  I am anti-manipulation.  Whomever did that manipulated the manipulators.  Well done.
In response to point 3, this has been beaten to death.  The people here are NOT an accurate representation of the general global populace.

Fuck this sub and fuck bitcoin.
I've been in bitcoin for nearly four years and in this sub under different user names for almost as long.
This place is a toxic cesspool of wannabe geniuses and social manipulation.
I do not trade so don't bother with those boilerplate responses.
Everyone here thinks he/she is going to be a gazzilionaire.  It's never going to fucking happen.
You are all fucking crazy.  Roger Ver is going to get himself killed, IMHO, and this thing is about to implode thanks to all of the govt plants here and all the other bullshit.
If someone farts, China blows a load.
There are too many people in bitcoin who, after 2-3 weeks, think they are economic geniuses.
This is fucking ridiculous.  I wouldn't trust Roger Ver to pay my rent.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:02:12

This goes in the no shit category.
Talk to the self-proclaimed President to-be of "the best" Bitcoin chain, Roger Ver.
The smart people know this already.  Those that want to take control of it don't give a shit.  They just want more money and power.  Status quo.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:02:15
BU is little more than an attempt by trailer trash Ver to control Bitcoin-possibly with support from Asian governments.
Ver is going to piss off the wrong person or people and find himself in a less than desirable position in the not-to-distant future, IMHO.
He is an opportunistic piece of shit.  That's it.  He got lucky and now he's swinging his dick around.
I guarantee you he is, in some way, working with Asian government to push this shit-show of his into the mainstream.
Edit:  How many people do you think have been deployed to this sub to post shit, downvote, etc?
If you think this is not happening, you fail.

@_date: 2017-03-18 06:28:22
I keep saying I'll never post here again, etc.  
-Roger Ver is trash.
-Many of the brightest minds have been working on Bitcoin Core for years.
-BU has been proven to be poorly executed.  Also, the name MUST have been something Ver came up with.
-This is beyond ridiculous at this point.  I hope Ver burns through everything he owns trying to control Bitcoin/bitcoin.
-IF...IF he SOMEHOW pulls it off, I'm done with Bitcoin.  I want nothing to do with anything Roger Ver is associated with.  
-Ver is toxic and this Samson Mow douchebag is about as worthless as can be.
EDIT:  This guy.  THIS GUY?  
Take a tequila shot every time he says bitcoin.  He is an idiot who got lucky and is now trying to control bitcoin with the help of Asian countries.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:36:51
Roger Ver really needs to stop being a cowboy.  He is not bright, got lucky and is going to end up pissing off someone he shouldn't or will wish he hadn't...  That is how I see it playing out...  
His knowledge of martial arts that he learned as a result of getting his ass kicked when he was young will not help him.

Yup, I am.  Not here, not with you, not with this sub and not when once every other fucking month there is some new China bullshit, manipulation, etc.
It's old.  China needs to be removed from the equation just as you suggested in a post shortly after suggesting I have issues and minutes after I said we need to just block China.
China needs to be blocked.  Block their farms, remove their delusions of grandeur Twitter posts from the equation.  Ignore their PBOC shit.
THAT is what is hurting bitcoin - not my magic words and frustration.

Really?  That is your argument?  Thousands of people are involved with Bitcoin.  BU will be ripped apart within a couple hours after it goes live. 
Ver has bargain basement coders, paid trolls and faked nodes.  He is little more than a used car salesman in his behavior and appearance.
Let him try.
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:56:40
Centralization IS the problem-ergo my post.
Your solutions (changing the algorithm) will only aggravate the argument.
People who understand what this (Bitcoin) is and have money to spare need to step up else I think things will not work out with China controlling the show.
Regardless of your opinion of him, John McAfee is doing just that.
We need more people like him on a global scale.

To me, he looks like a used car salesman, has a punch-able face and is generally annoying when he speaks.
Hundreds of highly intelligent people on Core vs Roger "the robot" Ver and his tiny pool of bargain basement coders..?
Why is this even a topic of debate?  Seriously?  
What government (China) is helping with this in an attempt to take complete control at all costs?
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:16:57
Figure it out.  Anything I say here will be downvoted then proved within 6-12 months as has been the case thus far.
This specific thread will never gain support given that BTC is supposed to be global without any sort of regulation.
The one individual who is trying to argue with me is not bright enough to understand my point.

@_date: 2017-01-18 02:56:27
If exchanges want to operate, a new paradigm needs to be implemented.
Anomalies such as have been visible in the past few years especially can easily trigger algorithms.
People should be able to trade-abso-fucking-lutely.
Blatant market manipulation can and should be stopped.
The goal is to reinvent money and make it BETTER.
Allowing the same bullshit is not helping.
@_date: 2016-06-21 06:56:47
Yes.  However, they don't roll that way.  Clearly you've not seen their "cool" AMA:   
They are a joke.  Count how many times they say "like."  I cannot.
Edit:  I did use them to purchase BTC despite everything else.  Asking for social profile information is above and beyond.  I believe (and I suggested this about 2 years ago under another account) that their goal is to be the Facebook of finance.
I am not OK with this if I am correct.
@_date: 2016-06-07 07:20:39
For the thousandth fucking time, there are a small number of people controlling/trading on the exchanges and dictating price.  Things are manipulated like crazy.
I truly do not understand what part of this you people do not understand.
@_date: 2017-01-08 04:55:10
IF...  IF this works on some semblance of a global scale (meaning a billion+ use it), most people on will not realize much as a result of their investment for 10 more years, is my guess.
The original question from OP is worthless.  Only the people controlling the price movement on the exchanges can answer that-or time travellers and people with actual crystal balls.
See, I didn't mention manipulation...  Oops.

The people here are so fucking delusional it is borderline unbelievable.
Pretty much nobody here is ever going to be rich as a result of bitcoin-this includes myself.
You people don't get that so you parrot the same phrases and repost the same fucking memes adnauseum.
A couple hundred new people join every few months and they are now all experts and repost the same shit again and again.
Then China sees this, blows things up a bit.  More money flows in and they crash it right the fuck back down using whatever story works.  This has happened every 2-3 months for years to some degree.
Your 1 or 2 bitcoin are never going to make you wealthy.
I truly don't understand what the fuck is wrong with you people.
This really is a fucking cult. 
Then you have people who are also self-proclaimed experts drawing arbitrary lines on graphs showing cup handles and where the run-up will be once the dragon chases the dead cat bounce along the singularity.
THEN you have Bobby Lee pop up from time-to-time playing like he doesn't have down syndrome and saying everything is cool Roger Ver style before Mt. Gox's implosion. 
AND THEN you have the Chinese who won't support Segwit because they'll get reduced fees, potentially...  Some of the most brilliant code every written and they want a few moh dollah rather than help to create and support tech that could help most of the world.
This is a fucking disaster and I blame the Chinese and politics.  
Edit 2:
Approximately 1.5 years ago I was shit on for calling Roger Ver an opportunistic piece of shit who resembles a used car salesman.  Today, many people now get it.
2 years ago I shit on Coinbase and more specifically Ehrsam and Armstrong.  I was downvoted to oblivion yet again.  Now people are beginning to understand.  BTW, this is the video that sparked my response. 
These people who use the word "like" once or twice a sentence are running the largest US exchange:  
I also shat on Jeremy Allaire of Circle between 1.5 and 2 years ago.  Everyone blasted me.  Now Circle dropped bitcoin and everyone is pissed off.
Go through my post history.  I think all of those posts were made from this account.  The Allaire one may not have been.
Keep downvoting me though.  So far I have been correct 85% of the time.

For whatever reason, this is my first exposure to this guy.
I don't disagree with him.  This China shit happens over and over and over and over.
Then the "uber market gurus" suggest we needed a re-trace or whatever because things happened too fast.
The people involved with bitcoin need to make their minds up.  A 400 hundred USD rise is largely insignificant in the grand scheme of things.
All of the people claiming 10k, 100k or 1 million dollar bitcoins need to understand that if it happens, it will be fast.  
At the rate things are going, the sun will burnout before 100k is reached.
If the timid Chinese traders are going to dump every time Chinese govt. farts, that is a problem.
Perhaps the Chinese govt. is making a statement to show the world they largely control bitcoin.

You people all think you're going to be rich.  You will never be rich.  You are in this for the wrong reasons.
Too the moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Edit: just to be clear, I used "too" on purpose.  At least 1/4-1/3 of the people who post here do not understand the basics of English grammar.
A person with a pulse can use Amazon.  The supposed killer app, OpenBaazar, can be a nightmare to just get it running.
IF.  and that's a big IF, this doesn't fail, it will be at least 10-15 years before enough people globally use bitcoin to make OpenBazaar useful.
You can blow Andreas and Jeffrey Tucker, along with others, as much as you want...  
Wall Street money, ETF?  If I were you, I wouldn't want that human shit anywhere near bitcoin.  People already fuck with it enough.  You just want to be rich though.  You will not be-ever-unless you're Roger Ver (and he is trash) or a select few other individuals.  The people that control this world will never allow unknown people to wield power over the global economy. 
Unless there are big changes soon, this is never going to work.

OK, Joe Average, please explain to us how someone takes manual control across all exchanges globally to create a pump and then a dump.  I'm told this is not manipulation even though it happens globally simultaneously.  Also, it happens randomly across all exchanges within minutes of each other.

I think they are in trouble.

I've been saying for at least 2 years that this is manipulated like a motherfucker.  Pretty much everyone downvotes me every time I mention it.
I couldn't figure out exactly how it was being done.

@_date: 2017-01-18 02:44:53
Dumb response.  Many other things are manipulated and have higher market cap.
We need to stop the manipulation and make exchanges accountable.
Otherwise we are right back where we started in many respects.
Just my humble opinion.
@_date: 2017-01-11 07:53:33
I shouldn't need to open a case for them to fulfill their service you fool.
BTW, to != too

Yeah, no.
Also, the China zero trading fee shit was supposedly over...
Bullshit.  The system is being manipulated like a morherfucker.  They're still doing it.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:57:47
Because the shit is manipulated.  Ask Roger Ver what he was doing tonight.  Hell, ask the exchanges what he has been doing the past couple weeks.  I'd wager most anything that he is responsible.

Changing market valuation of an asset based on insider knowledge or pooled resources.

It is also called theft.

What I'd like to know is how many of you downvoting can even explain what a derivative is without Googling it.
Also, have you got the Last of Us Platinum Trophy?  I do.
No?  You suck at games and finance go away.  
That's possibly one of the best games ever released and you people like to blow each other here about bitcoin.  
Where do you separate truth from reality?  In this instance you don't.
I have Platinum'd what some people consider ridiculously hard.  
This sub is a cesspool of unintelligent people who categorically feel the opposite in terms of I lost my train of thought.   Please insult me here:

I get down voted all the fucking time by you halfwits who want "moon."  I've ended up correct most of the time.
Protip: your one or two bitcoins will more than likely not make you a wealthy person in your lifetime.  So, forget that.  Every time new people come here in waves they seem to think they are going to be gazillionaires in a couple years.  Not. Going. To.happen.
Instead, perhaps for hodlers, think of it as a savings account where you actually get interest like people used to.

Thanks for the insight, genius.  My autistic self drives an M4.  You?
Blow me.
I flip and flop all over the place on purpose just to get responses and see what they are based on my posts.
If I put a to the moon post in whatever capacity, awesome.  If I post the opposite, downvote mania.
This subreddit is full of shitheads and wannabe millionaires.
Much like your comment, the majority of what I see here and read is not far removed from YouTube comments.

I'd rather roll the dice and sock away X amount per month in bitcoin, knowing full well the risks as they currently are, than keep my money in a savings account, for example, where you will most likely accrue zero interest.

These exchanges know who is doing it.
For once we can stop the manipulation of a global currency.
Why is this not a topic of discussion?
Edit:  Either I'm being down-voted by bots or the people down-voting me are part of the problem and need to be kicked in the dick.
Option 3 is they have absolutely no fucking idea what they're talking about

This is not true (transfers reported as sales) per Charlie Lee however, people keep providing the same false information.
@_date: 2016-12-25 07:14:08
By a tiny group of people on the exchanges.  Most of these exchanges fake volume.  This handful of people on the exchanges kick-off, and regularly rely on, bots.  At this point, approx every 1-1.5 months they push it up a bit then pull it down to "take profits"-AKA stealing.  Some call it trading.  I call it theft.  Right now it's no better than the current system.

Where the fuck do I sign up for this?  JFC.  You people are not going to change the world.  This is not going to change the world.
The UX is a fucking disaster.  People have to wonder if their savings will be stolen at every moment after every mouse click.
Let it go.  It's not going to happen.  The market cap is where it is largely because it has been manipulated just like every other market.  YAY!
@_date: 2016-12-03 07:51:24
I believe the act of kicking off bots simultaneously globally once every 2-9 weeks (or sooner)  indicates something different from "trading."
It is a few people deciding the global bitcoin market and it needs to stop.

@_date: 2017-04-08 06:55:41
Perhaps because some of the brightest people on the planet are working on Bitcoin to help create a better world for everyone while you are being ignorant, shitting on it and presenting yourself to those who keep up-to-date on related developments as an intellectual when, in fact, you are an idiot.

You could say pretty much the same thing about people who bought into the IPOs of Google, Facebook, etc.  I know people here frown upon that analogy however, in a way, it makes it easier to explain to people.
People contribute money to the tech in various ways and for various reasons without necessarily knowing what the outcome will be, much like with the above examples.
To your question (kind of), I have no intention of using my bitcoin until it reaches roughly 50k each.  I say that not knowing when/if that will ever happen.  I'd be dead before 1% annual growth would allow for that.

I've been downvoted, ridiculed and told I was stupid for years for having the audacity to suggest Bitcoin/bitcoin was being manipulated like a motherfucker...
Exchange manipulation was finally confirmed and a subset of miner manipulation was finally confirmed.
I wouldn't have posted about manipulation ad nauseum if I didn't think it to be true.
Once again, props to for figuring it out.  I've also been downvoted in the past for suggesting I trust you.  It may have been under an account I've not used in years so, I cannot provide proof.
In any event, team VerChina has always been shady.
Ver is like a used car salesman in both conduct and appearance.
They are the minority and the majority is far brighter than them...  They will NEVER control Bitcoin.

OP is a douchebag.
@_date: 2017-04-08 07:57:11
No, they have had ulterior motives.
Wu and Ver should seriously consider just admitting things or at least retreat from the spotlight.
Neither of them seem to be very bright.  Ver already has (supposedly) more money than most on the planet.
He is never going to control bitcoin and needs to just stop with the bullshit.
It's them vs the brightest people on the planet.  Who will win...?  /s
@_date: 2017-04-05 03:51:10
At least he stays true to what he believes.
The host suggests that ISIS also believes in what they are doing...  
I've watched videos of them destroying artifacts thousands of years old - scrubbing them from the record.  This saddens me and is blatant ignorance.
There are also videos of them blowing people up...
It would be amazing if religion would just go away so this shit stops.  It'll never happen, however.  It makes a large number of people very very rich.
EDIT:  Religion is the ultimate infomercial with false promises and exaggerated claims (to paraphrase Carlin.)
That is what keeps people in line and manageable by TPTB.  People used to worship the sun then "modern" man with "power" came along and said, hell, let's use this to our advantage.  Now, here we are.  It's fucking dumb.
How many virgins in heaven?  Sign me the fuck up they say!  You'll never know you lost the bet.  You'll be dead.
Religion is merely a form of control.
You fools running scripts gaming Reddit are also human trash.  Get a real fucking job.

He knows he got caught this time and there's nothing he can do about it.

Is this guy even a US resident?  
From what I have seen, he's a citizen of Brazil yet he was able to comment on the ETF, etc.
That aside, fuck him.  He is either not very bright or has much to lose as a result of this working.
Edit:  This ponzi scheme bullshit is not valid.  There is no ponzi in Bitcoin.  No promises have been made.  Everything could fail tomorrow.
Does he use Facebook?  A relative few people own the majority of Facebook stock and those that use Facebook have made Zuckerberg one of the most influential and wealthiest people on the planet.  Based on Jorge's logic, Facebook is also a ponzi.

All of the exchanges are completely aware of who is behind all trades...
If we must stick with exchanges (which we will for now), a sale should not be permitted to be relisted for a minimum of 24 hours.
It may help deal with things a bit.

Wait for the news...  This insider trading bullshit and the exchanges in general are fucking killing bitcoin.
How in the fuck is the world going to ever take this seriously when a few douchebags are manipulating the market like a motherfucker?
Stop with all the rhetoric.  We are nearly 10 years in and a handful of people are able to wipe BILLIONS in a matter of seconds.
This is insanity and the exchanges are to blame.
Don't like my opinion, I don't give a fuck.  These people, and I believe them to be mostly Asian, are panicky idiots.  
Most all of Bitcoin's problems are related to Asia.
Fucking block them already (somehow) so this tech can take off.

My opinion is that this will continue for quite a while so that "certain individuals" are able to pick up as much as possible (now that they are aware of Bitcoin/bitcoin) prior to pumping it up.  Short term, manipulators and day traders are going to do their thing.
@_date: 2015-09-10 03:30:23
I understand.  The theory is there should be NO NEED for debate if this thing really works.  Also, existing bitcoins can be further divided if need be, as you know.
When/if a single bitcoin is approaching a million dollar valuation this may need to be revisited.
Definitely not now.

This is a stupid fucking stance to take.  Why do people invest in anything?  
They do so because they see growth potential and use cases and/or a problem that is solved.  
At the same time, they anticipate a return on their investment if they are correct.
Many people invested in Facebook (for example) and ended up better off.  Those who didn't, the people using Facebook, make the investors wealthy by giving away their personal information and viewing ads.  
The benefit to those who use the service varies.
The potential benefit to those who use the Bitcoin network over "traditional" services is enormous.
Those who have helped to prop up the system by investing in an unproven tech over the past ~8 years knowing full well they could lose everything should benefit from the risk of attempting to better mankind and help fix the broke ass system we still rely on.

I'm 1000% confident they had ABSOLUTELY no knowledge of this, had never spoken with Blythe and would not use this knowledge to push their agenda together.
Also, glad to hear the Marshall's Auction was legit.  No favors called in, etc.
At least we know who to point to when the market is blatantly manipulated.  From this point forward, I'll refer to blatant bitcoin market manipulation as a "BM" because if it smells like shit, Blythe Masters is most likely behind it.

This instance was an example, IMHO, of them NOT acting in their best interests.  They are on this subreddit.  Morgan's episode was, in part, based on that.  I posted a comment thanking them and it was on the front page most of the day.  Their response was to take down a harmless video due to "copyright infringement."  It is a fucking joke.  If that wasn't taken down do you think they would have seen a multi-million dollar windfall?  More people probably watched it as a result of it being posted here than via cable.

Based on my experience, IBM is going to fuck this up too.  I'll not elaborate much outside of suggesting that most anything they try to touch anymore ends up being a failure (excluding engineering.)
Context:  IBM fucked up a billion dollar contract I was indirectly involved with.  They fail at most everything at this point.  I merely provided an example I was involved with.
So, it will most likely be premined crap, etc.

Ummm.  It seems you are a douche-bag.
My tactic was to ask you what the fuck you were talking about.

It's bullshit.  See how easy that was?  Now dazzle the audience by successfully applying TA to bitcoin.

This can be integrated into Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has exponentially more global recognition and investment.  
"Darkcoin" elicits a psychosocial response from people.
tl:dr - doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

I understand that.  That it is the contemporary paradigm does not make it correct.  It WILL die.

 Bill Gates
The greatest con artist, thief, and criminal who ever lived. In the total 30+ years that his company, Microsoft, was in existence, they have yet to produce one halfway decent product. Everything they make is a rip off of another companies product (Windows = Mac OS, Xbox = PlayStation, Zune = iPod, etc).
A message Bill Gates always sees when creating a new version of Windows "Are you sure you want to change all words beginning with "Mac OS" located on the volume Mac OS X Install DVD.dmg to "Windows?"

I have never used DNMs (nor do I even smoke weed) however, they do seem to decrease violence.  
Enough is enough with this war on drugs.  Many people "in power" do drugs while siphoning money to fight drug use.

EVERYONE thinks they can make value judgments yet here we are with Hillary and Donald in the U.S. 
Fucking everyone.  Then the piece of shit bitcoin news sites (85% of which have "bit" in their name) regurgitate things.  Then it flows back to 10-12 times via multiple posts by people who have no lives.  It's kind of like The Human Centipede.  A handful of people pump shit out and the rest just eat it up.
