Well, I'm 17, and have a bit of free time.. Not quite sure about it though.

I see at least 2 positively reviewed apps in the play store after searching "undelete".

Congrats. You have your own opinion, you're free to share wherever you would like to.
Just know almost no one in this sub agrees with you, and will downvote you. If you would like to discuss reasons you think it will not rise, go ahead. But telling people their wrong won't get any upvotes.

There's a report button under reddit comments on the desktop version.

The goal is to do whatever you want with the money? The bitcoin still remains in the market, just with a business now. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:23:37
That doesn't say anywhere that bitcoins are done.

I'm glad you are clearing the air in it.

Then how is that good to buy from..?

I really hope one day, you can afford a rocket and reach the moon...

No, they shouldn't, and here's why.
They still exist in the market. They're being held by the FBI. They're are still active among the 21 million bitcoins that will be produced.
If someone pays cash for 27,000 bitcoins, the government receives 27,000 * selling price per bitcoin, and the buyer receives 27,000 bitcoins. In the view of the market, the bitcoins shift from one owner to another. They were not created, and they were never missing. Just like people holding bitcoins in their wallets.

what the hell

I don't know how ips get updated. The world Wide Web doesn't really get updated, they just create a new version. They can't release bug fixes for the Internet. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:14:55
No. They were never "out of circulation".
The FBI seized the bitcoins. They weren't destroyed, they weren't sent away. They're were still as much a part of the market as holding a bitcoin in a wallet for a year is. Those 27,000 bitcoins just didn't move. Now, they will be moved. Sure, re-introduced to other people using bitcoin, but not to the market. To the market, the 27,000 bitcoins were still there the whole time, waiting to be exchanged.

Could possibly be the RES extension, I've never used reddit without it. There's a report button that sends a message to mods I believe telling them to ban a user.

Any cash involved? I have free time, but would definitely get involved if it had some incentive..

Adblocker is obviously holding you back from all the Russian brides.

Then, like all other bitcoin transactions, the market will move. But the user said the purchase of 27000 btc from the government will shift the market, which isn't true.
