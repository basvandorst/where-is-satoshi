What makes you think the remaining money is yours?  You gambled away your half, and a chunk of hers.  Everything that remains is hers...

You need to get this through your fucking head...
You are NOT going to make back the money you lost.  What makes you think you'll go from literally, being one of the worst investors ever... to suddenly making it all back no problem?  
Here's a hint:  You're not.  If it was that easy, everyone here would have done it already.  Why do you think they aren't profiting a few hundred grand in a few months?  
Give the remaining $280,000 to your sister and eat YOUR losses because they are in fact YOUR losses.  Just because YOU fucked up does not entitle you to also gambling away her half.   Give her the 280,000 like she deserves and hope that she's cool with you only fucking her over for $95,000 instead of all $375,000.

"Luck" but not gambling... sorry, but that shit don't add up. 
Give your sister as much of her 375,000 as you can, and then realize that you fucked up and you lost your share with your own stupid gambling decision.  Honestly... who goes $400,000 in the red and still doesn't get a wake up call?
