You will see this garbage until institutional money is finished accumulating.  They are not going to buy $130mil at a Time because the market would take off and they would have to buy higher.  Also financial systems have been given a warning that digital currencies may disrupt operations.  This tech is developing at an extremely fast pace and I think a lot of these companies black balling crypto are scared because they r late to the game already.  (THEY KNOW IT TOO)
So get ready for the doom and gloom goons(news articles that are B.S)��.  
Like I said before “billion dollar companies for pennies on the dollar per coin”.

Try this
1.  Acquire 1 full bitcoin 
2.  Aquire 10LTC and 10ETH 
3.  Get 3 or 4 altcoins that YOU believe will be around in 5yrs.  
4.  Don’t touch them for 2yrs. Then re-evaluate!
5.  If your an addict like most people in crypto then u will still want to trade.  After all the other steps r complete,  now u can start investing in the next best thing of the week (without touching your little crypto nest egg).   Human nature to want security....if u lose all the time it can become emotional, which = disasters in trading.  As long as you have steps 1-4 down you won’t be worried everyday, because it’s not always about tomorrow.  (Market Sentiment can change fast).

Here I have a trade for ya nebl on Binance.  Buy now at .0003968/$1.59.  Set a sell at .00041/$1.65 USD 
If it drops 5% sell and cut losses and go find another set up.  Keep in mind volume.  
Don’t risk everything on one coin U WILL LOSE!
Bailed on that trade and took a small loss.  No biggy onto the next.

I agree with u on that for sure!  More capital will help with that.  
Right now $1000 can cause a shift in technicals on some shit coins and day traders r jumping in on that.  Then getting dumped on by those said groups of scum.

I agree......if BTC was in place before economic downfall then at the very least they could keep power on to use BTC, which I believe could have at least kept the economy going.  O and check out this link about refusing gold to Venezuela.

That’s if that money goes back to fiat and what country.....,WEALTH redistribution coming.... along with negative interest rates and inflation.  The price increases were from FOMO.  Next time the real thing and I think the vision of BTC creator will come to light.  The recession of 08 wasn’t really taken care of.  They slapped a bandaid on and made us pay for it.  People have not forgot like they want u to.  We are becoming smarter with tech and the magic tricks big government try to pull on us is getting harder do.  
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:25:23
That’s funny but a possibility!
@_date: 2019-03-19 22:04:24
BTC should have already been in place....This is the lesson learned about fiat.  This is the reason he created this.  Negative interest rates scare the piss out of me.  Wealth has been taken in the past from the government.  
@_date: 2019-03-20 00:44:23
I agree...out of all the yrs trading this takes the cake.  BTC acts like an index and all the shit coins are like options.  Problem is the real money isn’t here yet.  It will be, but the exchanges have to make it an easy one stop shop like a normal brokerage because people hate change.  I think if these exchanges would offer insurance and actually payout if something happens then people will flock for the right reason.  (Proven Project’s). People focus on safety through wealth.  Problem is what if ur wealth is taken and an exchange can’t pay you.  When exchanges offer that safety then we can roll and not have to worry about Scammy garbage.  We can invest in the right companies long term.

In about 48hrs I will be launching an online store......  I will be offering 5 - 10% discount IF products are purchased with crypto.  I agree “everyone accepting crypto” = future.  I have been talking crypto for the last 3 yrs and everyone around me thinks I’m nuts.  If I can offer  a discount using crypto then people will use crypto.  ��
@_date: 2019-03-16 03:41:09
Yes...  make sure u can cover all the cash tho.  When the bank transfer clears just send it back.
Example: if u transfer from the bank $1000 and add say $500 on card then make sure u have a total of $1500.  Once ur bank transfer clears (about 3 business days) send that $1000 back to the bank (usually 1 business day).

Support and resistance points on the daily chart.  Obviously that’s only one part of analytics.  I’m not going to claim guru or anything like that.  I normally don’t post anything.  Every wall st.

I just use the chart on binance on a phone.  I prefer EMA.  This was easy to see happening.  It almost always breaks down and touches the 200 or close and shoots back up.....also consider the channel we have been in for like 6 weeks now.  The next leg up is bout to happen hopefully.  I have my stop set and buys ready��

I been telling people to look at the weekly or monthly chart to gage ur position.  If ur long ur long.  These little fluctuations the past few weeks is nothing......it’s crypto.....so expect 10% moves.  When one person affects the market everyone freaks out and literally two days later the price will keep in whatever path it’s been in at that point in time.  It’s not like bitcoin is filling bankruptcy anytime soon.

Yes you can add any amount to receive btc.  Example:  $500 might be .08 BTC at the time, its fractional so just add more to build up to 1 BTC.  I started with Coinbase and they do have auto invest.  I’d say give up one minor thing u buy everyday and throw it in BTC.  I gave up energy drinks.  I added what I spend in one month and put that into BTC.  Everyone in crypto had to start somewhere....me 5yrs ago.  I really don’t post much because my give a shit level is extremely low and most of these post are repeats or full of shit.

I really don’t use cash, just a statement about fees, because all I hear about is btc fees this and that.  Just trying to point out atm fees are shitty too.  I do agree fees suck.  Wait till the bigger exchanges offer platforms with custody of BTC.  When I first started trading it was $15$ for standard buy/sell orders.  Now it’s like $4?  Crypto retail investors are getting rapped on fees because the difficulty of use right now and only few exchanges offer good trading options.

I think we are to far along now for that to happen.  Keep in mind election year 2020.  Trump will be re elected off of soaring investments into the US.... You heard him say all ready he was going to bring wealth like u never seen into the USA.  Look around the world to see what’s happening now lol.  So I would imagine we will see some kind of economic change before NOV2020.  Just an opinion and different way of thinking?

Again this is bottom.....u won’t be asking when price is above 10 this summer.  We been riding bottom for awhile now.  The sector is waaaaaaaay better off this time.  I know it’s stressful when ur at ur break even or slight loss.  Once we start climbing which we r, then u won’t question ur decision.  You made ur decision stick with ur trade.  Your early so don’t sweet it!

The massive inflow of cash at one time triggered the bull market which a lot of technical traders have been waiting for......plus tax returns, 1st of the month pay checks and momentum.

I been saying this for the last two weeks......then include the big boys trying to get custody of btc so they can run their new platforms for institutional buyers.  If the accumulation is to quick the price will take off because of the theory of “store of value” no sellers.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:26:42
I do agree with u on halving for sure.  The normal dumps we were used to are not as bad.  When it does try to tank buyers eat up all the sells.  The sentiment is the same as last time but now it’s wider spread with a touch of stability as of now.  My personal opinion and the street view is anything under 10k is a steal.  I think the dumps above $20k are going to be scary.  That’s why I set a timeline and price target I want.  Set it and forget it till at least halving.
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:12:46
Ok math time.....
11% of Americans u say......
327million (Americans) as of 2018!
So 10% of 327million = 32,700,000 
So (Estimate) would be
32million Americans!
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:39:15
Yea been hearing that for the last month.....oh it’s gonna dump and next thing u read is shorts getting smoked �� big time.  The market is not acting like it did 2017.  The players that we wanted in 2017-2018 didn’t show up.  Now we are down from $20k with $3k low and the players are here now.  
Set it n forget it till 2021 at the very least.  
Anything under $10k is a steal.
