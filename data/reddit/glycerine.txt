I agree unless the BIOS metrics are also edited. outbound bandwidth is measured through your nic, then the router I guess. If they had a virus at both ends; hmm - potentially could hide a KB of data I suppose.
On that note, regardless of net connection information goes through the network card. You could use wireshark and hard monitor every communication - that wouldn't be easy either.
Monitoring the physical cable would be best bet _(concept of ADSL)_; But not many people have this ability at home. But that said electric is pushed down a connected telephone line when you plug it in. Potentially you could hide data in this static.
On that note though; it seems this article is debunked therefore this stuff is mad conspiracy and I doubt anyone would believe the government are tracking every move. But yes. Yes they are.

It's a real prepaid credit card - but with bitcoin transactions
