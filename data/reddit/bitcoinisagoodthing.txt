after reading several of your comments in this thread, you seem like someone who would really appreciate andreas antonopoulos’ talks on bitcoin (if you haven’t already seen them). you can find them on youtube. his username is aantonop.

they said 2018. i have not heard anything more specific than that.

it can easily take upwards of a week and a half. coinbase sends you an email that includes an estimate of when your money will be ready (but that can potentially be off by a couple days).
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:59:49
that’s a lot of questions. i’ll take a few of them.
the mining reward automatically gets issued to the miners. that is built-in to the software.
companies could absolutely spend lots of money mining bitcoin. but the way it works is that it takes the mining community about ten minutes to earn a block reward. and then the reward is 12.5 BTC for the one miner/mining pool that earned that block reward. if more miners come online and they start finding blocks at a faster rate, the mining difficulty will increase to even things back out to one block every 10 minutes. so it’s not like you can run enough miners to earn 10,000 BTC/day or anything like that. (by the way, the mining difficulty adjustments happen about once every two weeks.)
on top of that, every four years, that mining reward gets cut in half.
once all the bitcoins have been mined, miners will still mine for blocks. but at that point, they will make all of their money off of transaction fees, instead of block rewards.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:43:26
thanks to the added hash rate, it looks like the average block time is almost down to eight minutes. that’s one reason why the mempool is clearing up.

people are actively working to improve bitcoin and the underlying technology.
it’s sort of like asking, in 1995, if the internet will die out in 10-15 years because of outdated technology.
as long as people have the foresight to see the future potential, and they keep working to push the technology forward, then prospects are good.

no, that’s really not the case at all. be wary of putting too much stock into what any one person tells you about where bitcoin is headed.
it’s hard to predict exactly where we’re going, without the luxury of a crystal ball. but if someone said, “choose the one existing cryptocurrency that is most likely to be the dominant cryptocurrency in 5, 10, or 20 years,” the obvious choice would be bitcoin.
there are lots of people with lots of different perspectives on bitcoin and cryptocurrency. when you are evaluating things you read and hear in the crypto space, try to remember this: people who have a vested interest in seeing another crypto “beat” bitcoin have a clear incentive to badmouth bitcoin.
when it comes to this stuff, separating smart analysis from noise is no easy feat. good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:19:24
i’ll answer your second and third questions, since those are easier.
we will probably need to improve the base blockchain layer to enable it to handle more than 7 transactions/second, eventually. a block size increase might be one piece of that.
now, if you’re wondering if maybe bcash took the right approach by increasing the block size limit when they did, i’d argue they did not. for one thing, if and when a block size increase comes to bitcoin, there should be strong consensus around it.
disclaimer: when i talk about a block size increase, i’m not talking about technologies that increase the “effective block size,” like segwit.

well, bitcoin actually is as complicated as you thought it was.
i’m reminded of the cliché about poker: it takes a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master. by no means am i saying it’s impossible to understand bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies, for that matter). i am saying that the more you dig, the more layers of complexity you find.
here’s an example. let’s say alice gets interested in bitcoin, she spends several hours learning about it and starts to feel like she has a handle on the most important aspects.
then, alice starts hearing more about the ongoing debate about bitcoin vs. bcash (also known as bitcoin cash). she wants to get a better handle on the arguments from both sides, so she immerses herself in that. she starts learning more and more about the significance of block size limits and segwit and lightning network and centralization of nodes and so on.
as soon as alice had wanted to evaluate how different coins stacked up against each other, she had about three options:
1. listen to other people who seem knowledgeable and trustworthy. go with what they recommend.
2. give up, because it’s not worth the effort, and just pick a side or stay neutral without worrying too much about it.
3. keep learning and learning until she could make a sound decision based on her own good research.
i like option 3. as you spend more time looking into the bitcoin/cryptocurrency space, you find there’s just more and more to learn. and it’s rewarding to spend all that time learning about this stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:54:08
one problem with your original block of text is that you believe that the miners have more power than they actually do.
the miners cannot singlehandedly hijack bitcoin (outside of a 51% attack, which is not a practical concern as of today). bitcoin is too decentralized for that. bitcoin is more decentralized than whatever other coin(s) you may be smitten with.
when did the smart money leave bitcoin, in your estimation? in mid-december, around the ATH? the fundamentals have not changed since then. bitcoin’s history is full of people repeating the same things when the price shoots up and then goes back down: “dumb money bagholders need to get off this sinking ship!”
bitcoin will be fine.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:31:31
well, for anyone with a sizable investment, a wallet is a must-have.
but if your investment is small enough where you’d end up losing 10% of the investment in transfer fees (transferring the bitcoin to your wallet and then, later, back to the exchange), then it’s less cut-and-dry as to whether or not a wallet is right for you.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:19:58

the transaction fees are not going to stay high forever. the technology is steadily improving.
it’s kind of like asking how the internet could ever reach mass adoption in the early or mid-nineties. “it’s too slow. it’s too hard to use. you can’t talk on the phone and go online at the same time.” we’re dealing with the challenges of being early adopters. but we could reap some of the rewards, too.
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:03:48
good stuff. i stand corrected.
i knew litecoin was less secure than bitcoin, but i had erroneously assumed the block time was a factor in that, without thinking too hard about it. i hadn’t realized it solely comes down to hash rate.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:43:15
as long as you send it to a segwit address (starting with a 3) and not a legacy address (starting with a 1), then yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:49:16
to expand on what the other commenter said, they are not necessarily single-use addresses. if you want to reuse the same address 5 or 10 times, you are free to do so. all of the addresses will work forever (meaning they are all permanently tied to your private key).

bitcoin is highly resistant to “hijacking.”
one of the reasons the internet was so successful is that the people or industries (or even governments) who felt threatened by the internet had no way to shut it down. the internet wasn’t designed/developed/being run by a single company. there was no way to buy “the internet company” and then have ownership of the internet.
here’s another way to think about how voting works in bitcoin:
1. if the US government decides it has its own ideas about what bitcoin should be, they could make a separate copy of the code and then change it as they see fit.
2. the other version of bitcoin, the one we’re using right now, would still exist.
3. if the bitcoin community wanted to adopt the US government’s “new and improved” bitcoin, they could. if they wanted to stick with the other one, they could do that, too.
4. if part of the community went one way and the other part went the other way, then we would have two different coins. one would be called bitcoin (that would likely be the one that hadn’t changed, in this example) and the other one would have some new name. then both coins could compete in the free market, to let the best coin win.
in summary, updates are coming. but at the same time, it’s good that we have a system that defends against “bad” updates.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:32:33
the wider crypto investing community mostly seems clueless, too.
source: the charts
but some of them can learn over time.
@_date: 2018-01-31 13:51:29
that’s what i mean about you overestimating the power of the miners. the miners are not “the handful that have the most power.” the miners, the full nodes, the developers, and the users all have a say in the future of bitcoin. that’s one part of the decentralization of bitcoin, which is one of the major advantages it has.
the miners are not the reason that we have “fork-after-fork.” anyone can fork bitcoin. and there are plenty of forks.
only two of the bitcoin/bitcoin hard fork coins are getting significant attention from miners. those are bitcoin and bcash. and the bitcoin hash rate is over 7x higher than the bcash hash rate. your argument about the lack of consensus from miners doesn’t really hold up to scrutiny.

we are somewhat more prepared to deal with a higher number of transactions. but scaling is not a completely solved problem at this point. more of a work in progress.
there have been two significant scaling improvements since 2017 that i’m aware of.
1. more exchanges and other entities that make lots of bitcoin transactions have started batching transactions, i.e. turning many small transactions into one bigger transaction, which reduces congestion and lowers fees.
2. segwit adoption has increased. segwit is an incremental scaling improvement for bitcoin’s base layer.
edit: there’s also lightning network, but i interpreted the question as more focused on the impact of a large influx of buys and sells in the base layer.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:06:43
sounds like you have been drinking the wrong kool-aid.
@_date: 2019-07-20 13:55:00
you might be defining “getting built on top of it” to mean building a second layer protocol on top of bitcoin’s base layer. but when big companies start leveraging bitcoin in various ways, they are “building on top of bitcoin,” in a sense. it’s akin to saying companies are “building on top of the internet” by using the internet as a critical piece of infrastructure (where their entire business is dependent on keeping their website up and running, and providing customer support via email, etc.).
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:16:45
yeah, i saw public ratings from a reputable establishment.
bitcoin: A

@_date: 2019-07-04 01:19:18

you might want to do some research on BIP39. maybe you can find something that will point you in the right direction.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:18:27
do you think the adoption rate for lightning network will increase a lot faster than the adoption rate for segwit has? (yes, i know segwit is a prerequisite for lightning network.)
lightning network is a “sexy” new feature in a way that segwit is not. so on a broader level, as time goes on, do you think we will be better at quickly adopting “sexy” features than we are at adopting more subtle, nuanced changes?
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:20:58
since you seem well-intentioned, i’ll be sincere. that was a joke, although it roughly aligns with my personal beliefs.
there are some public ratings, but no, they did not come from any reputable sources.

if you have both seed words and a passphrase, then you’ll need to enter both when you import the wallet. if you have a passphrase, but you don’t enter it, then you’ll see exactly what you’re seeing now: a zero balance.

first, avoid publicly sharing details about how much bitcoin you have and/or how much you intend to buy. that is more likely to hurt you than help you.
dollar cost averaging is always a good approach. there’s always a chance that buying all at once could work out better for you, but you’d be taking a much bigger risk than you would if you had DCAed. you said it seems like it would be smart to wait and see if it drops back under $10k. there is a real chance that it’s never going below $10k ever again. and there’s a reasonable chance the price could increase by thousands of dollars in the coming weeks.
i’m not saying there’s only one right approach. but if you’re trying to look into your crystal ball and decide based on that, you might get lucky or you might get unlucky. DCA takes some of the luck out of it.
for wallets, i would recommend buying a hardware wallet, like a ledger or a trezor.

under no circumstances will i ever buy any BCH.
i will keep this short and sweet.
i took a very quick glance at your comment history. it looks like you have some real interest in digging into some of the details and getting a better understanding of why various cryptocurrencies are likely to succeed or fail.
your time would be best served by researching why BTC is much better positioned for success than any of the alts, including BCH (even IF lightning network eventually turns into a failed project).
i understand that you have put money into some of the alts. and it’s not easy to walk away or admit that it was a mistake.
if you are left with questions about why i am saying these things, great. use that as a jumping off point for the research you do from this point forward. try to listen to more of the people who actually understand the technology.
good luck.

the short answer is that the code is open-source. anyone can look through the code to try to understand how it all works. many people do.
for those with the requisite background in software engineering and cryptography, there is no need to blindly trust that bitcoin is not a scam. people can verify it for themselves.

personally, i would not suggest using a free wallet. i would recommend a hardware wallet, like a ledger or a trezor.

i watched the video. they do not talk about deflation at all.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:37:09
as more and more money flows into bitcoin and the market cap increases, volatility will decline. bitcoin’s volatility has been trending down and that trend is likely to continue. in other words, the price is becoming more stable, albeit very gradually.
bitcoin is not solely a “tool for trading.” it can be a store of value, and a medium of exchange (which is what you’re referring to when you say “tool for trading”), and it can be other things, too. all at the same time.

coinbase DOES let you purchase BTC at its current price while the funds are transferred from your bank account.
all you need to do is add to your BTC wallet directly. that locks in the price. if you try to add money to your USD wallet first and then use that to buy BTC, then you will be stuck waiting for the deposit before you can buy.
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:25:09
there is a transaction fee for every bitcoin transaction. the transaction fees go to the miners. it’s important to have these fees 1. to prevent attackers from spamming the network with garbage transactions (at virtually no cost to the attackers) and 2. to make the network more sustainable, long-term.
the other commenter is correct; GDAX will cover your transaction fee when you send BTC from your GDAX account, so that is one way to save on fees.
also, transaction fees are not necessarily higher for bigger transactions, so you can save on fees by transferring e.g. $1,000 at a time, rather than $10 at a time. there is not a direct relationship between the transaction fee and the amount of the payment. instead, transaction fees grow or shrink based on the size of your transaction on the blockchain, which is separate from the payment amount. transaction fees also vary depending on the level of network congestion at the time.
is anything being done to lower these transaction fees down the road? yes. there are projects in the works that could help in this area. lightning network is one example.

there are different types of fraud, so it’s hard to answer that question without more details.
but bitcoin can help to prevent issues where your credit card number gets stolen and then used for fraudulent transactions. bitcoin has a much stronger security model, since you never need to share your private key(s) with merchants or other users of the protocol.

his point is correct. you are trying to make a connection between scarcity and divisibility that just isn’t there.
the fact that bitcoin is scarce does not mean that it would be impossible for everyone on earth to have some bitcoin.
the fact that bitcoin is scarce means that it would be impossible for everyone on earth to have as much bitcoin as they want to have.
and whenever someone buys up x% of all the bitcoin and refuses to sell it (or demands an exorbitant price), then bitcoin’s scarcity only increases. divisibility does not really come into play. hence the other commenter’s point about fractions.

i would change your first question to: what drove the crash? as i see it, it was largely some combination of profit taking and panic selling. at some point, there are no more panic sellers and the market dynamics change.
and as to your other question, are you assuming that we need mass adoption and fully mature tech in order to justify a price of $20k? we don’t. not for hitting $20k. we need mass adoption before we have a shot at $1 million per bitcoin. but $20k is relatively easy.

that’s a bech32 address. a native segwit address. we will all have addresses like that eventually, but in the meantime, very few wallets or exchanges recognize that type of address.
for now, most people are using the P2SH segwit addresses, which are the ones that start with 3.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:04:56
here’s one strategy.
if you believe that BTC will be much more valuable in the future, then anytime you spend some or loan some out, you would immediately buy more.
- you loan out 5 BTC, which is valued at $50k, at the time.
- you immediately buy 5 more BTC, so your BTC balance has not decreased.
- once the loan has been repaid, you have recouped the original amount in terms of USD value ($50k), plus the interest.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:05:55
the value of your investment = the price per unit x the number of units you have.
if 1 BTC costs $10,000, that’s the price per unit.
if you have 0.077 BTC, that’s the number of units.
so the value of the investment would be $770. and you can compare that to the original investment amount to gauge profit.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:21:03
to sum up what others are saying, the only way that strategy is profitable is if you sell and then wait for the price to drop before you buy again. and if you do that, you need the drop in price to be big enough to cover your fees for the trades.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:17:06

you are looking for an exchange, not a wallet. exchanges let you buy and sell coins. wallets allow you to keep your coins safe, so you don’t lose everything if your exchange gets hacked or something like that.

the difficulty is not constantly adjusting. there is a difficulty adjustment roughly once every two weeks. and then the difficulty stays flat until the next difficulty adjustment, two weeks later.

you might benefit from learning more about how bitcoin works, why it is resistant to various threats, and how game theory affects bitcoin’s security and the bitcoin economy. developing a deep understanding of bitcoin takes a lot of time and effort. not everyone is going to want to deal with that. but for those who do, it becomes much easier to have peace of mind and to feel confident and secure in your decisions to buy and hodl... or not.
your idea about buying, hodling, and then unplugging is quite a good one. but if you do that, make sure you don’t unplug to the point where you forget how to access your bitcoins, once you want to use them.

listen to/watch andreas antonopoulos. read the bitcoin standard by saifedean ammous. find some other good sources you can trust.
these questions have already been answered in great detail. no one is going to write you a book in a reddit comment to spell it all out for you. roll up your sleeves and do some research.

BCH is not bitcoin. bitcoin is BTC. BCH is “bitcoin cash,” which is a completely different cryptocurrency with a misleading name. the fact that bitcoin.com misleads people into thinking bitcoin cash (BCH) is bitcoin is very unfortunate. i’m sorry your introduction to the bitcoin world has not gone well so far.

good points. i am not sure exactly what he meant by fixed fees, but i interpreted it as a fixed fee in terms of satoshis per byte. not a fixed fee for each transaction, which would be completely untenable.

if the U.S. federal government takes in the same amount of money that it spends over the course of a year, then that means the budget is balanced. in that case, the national debt would not increase or decrease that year.
if the government takes in less money than it spends over the course of a year, then that shortfall is called the deficit. in that case, the deficit would be added to the national debt.
in other words, a $1 trillion deficit means $1 trillion will be added to the national debt over the course of one year.
doubling the deficit means, “last year the government fell short by $x, but this year, they are falling short by $2x.”

you don’t need to buy a whole bitcoin. you can buy a very small fraction of a bitcoin, if you are so inclined.

with segwit, signatures are still stored inside the block. it’s just in a different place.
in segwit, the signatures are called witnesses and they are stored in the witness merkel tree.

i use a long O sound, like the one in “hold.” i.e. it rhymes with “yodel.”
but most people i’ve heard say “hoddle” instead.

no, you are talking about the national debt, which is not quite the same thing as the deficit.

over time, the block reward gets smaller. as that happens, miners will rely more and more on transaction fees as their source of income. once all the bitcoins have been mined, transaction fees will be the sole source of mining income.
without getting too deep in the weeds, how likely does it seem that we could pick a single, hardcoded transaction fee amount that would lead to a well-functioning bitcoin economy, even as the block rewards get cut in half every four years?
i’d say fixed transaction fees would be very destabilizing for the mining industry, to say the least.
