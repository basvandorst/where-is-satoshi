He knowingly and admitted his guilt... completely different.
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:39:02
Sorry mixing up my threads, hes definitely wrong and "withdrawing" most certainly is taxable
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:37:36
He probably meant withdrawing from the exchange to a ledger in it's current crypto state, ie non cash money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:00:44
How much did you sell?
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:42:17
No. While I agree it's probably relatively safe to keep btc in this particular database, no one will have forewarning if they go under. There will be no seconds to move funds. Tbh that attitude is dangerous and people should not think any non-fdic backed investment vehicle or btc is insured in any capacity by any institution. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:15:31
He linked them. They're not good.
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:17:18
This is stupid.
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:44:54
I was asking myself that last night
@_date: 2019-11-04 23:53:27
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:56:37
Not worth it. This guy doesn't know what he's doing in the slightest:
"Correct. I bank and hold. Like buying real gold or real estate. It is a hedge investment. Held in hardware wallet not a bank."
Just... no. Stop.
@_date: 2019-11-06 19:09:35
Assuming he meant Forex

Only your USD wallet is insured...

Shhhhh banks provide no value in this sub!
@_date: 2019-03-26 03:59:00
What does that have to do with FDIC insurance?
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:02:00
Lol right? Sign me up buttercup
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:08:40
... and if you notice fraud, it's reimbursed immediately because you're working with a financial institution. But obviously no value to credit cards whatsoever.
@_date: 2019-08-03 13:17:12
The former didnt happen though?
@_date: 2019-10-20 13:02:21
Everything about this screams scam. Every little thing. Nothing about it is creative it's just stupid with poor grammar and punctuation. Jesus.
@_date: 2019-08-09 01:49:36
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:33:37
Because people buy them on *exchanges* and often treat them similar to *securities* in an investment vehicle manner and may want to know if shady shit is going on? ......

@_date: 2019-06-09 19:27:17
This is quite stupid
@_date: 2019-08-01 10:25:13
He didn't say there was no taxable event on conversion between currencies, but likely imagined you meant withdrawing out of an exchange and converting to usable fiat at the same time. Which certainly is a cap gains event.
@_date: 2019-02-14 03:52:40
Oh, I didnt realize we were supporting organized crime. Oh, wait, this is reddit btc ...
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:21:10
In just about any other investment vehicle, colloquial  withdrawing is a taxable event as you're typically converting and selling into something else. So I can understand the confusion.

And no money laundering or illegal practices are done with bitcoin. Jfc.
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:40:11
It's hilarious you think that good old fashioned police work hasn't relied heavily on following and tracking payments. You know, like, forever.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:08:45
Also time in the market beats timing the market.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:47:52
Your research is a meme inferring that fiat money isnt real. Burden of proof is not on me in this situation.

What did linking me to anti money laundering legislation hope to accomplish? Am I supposed to believe we weren't interested in financial structures and payments until then? Guess Capone is still on the streets, huh.
This sub is going to the pits.
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:54:52
Not sure who "he" is?
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:59:06
Oh, yeah hes a total piece of shit and definitely dealt drugs. Didnt realize we were talking about him.

Jet fuel can't melt steel beams.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:18:25
Bitcoin is not attempting to stop lending. And while finite, you realize bitcoin is being generated in much the same way? To combat inflation?
@_date: 2019-04-20 14:48:28
Well, I'm sure socialism has everything under control, too. They got this, all part of the plan.
@_date: 2019-04-13 00:17:39
I understand the risks of a digital wallet but it's still legally your asset, and you can do with it as you please.
@_date: 2019-04-20 12:14:10
Don't deal drugs?
@_date: 2019-04-17 14:53:09
@_date: 2019-04-26 13:44:58
This guy still posting and trying swindle people?
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:54:17
I agree - hence why digital payments are a thing.  But it's also a bank's business to protect the assets of all their customers, to minimize losses due to theft, and help prevent money laundering/crime.  $700, at least in America, really isn't much of an issue to withdraw, but they do their best to keep the amount of cash on hand as low as possible to prevent losses due to theft.
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:52:18
Financial tyranny? Woof.
@_date: 2019-04-14 20:48:23
Well, given the volatility of BTC and FDIC insurance.... one is certainly more 'secure' than the other.

@_date: 2019-04-17 15:00:44
Yeah, this isn't what banks do.
@_date: 2019-04-17 15:26:40
If you think major central banks are flooding banks/society with more and more money, you're sorely mistaken. Claiming fiat money doesnt exist is frankly stupid.
@_date: 2019-01-21 06:55:45
It definitely wasn't a correct answer 
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:42:28
Kindly fuck off

Ohhh that looks like fun!
