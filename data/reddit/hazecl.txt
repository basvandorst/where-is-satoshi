I was just asking how he was going to ban them...
I can imagine a couple of ways, but that would transcend some constitutional liberties, and then we have greater worries than cryptos.

And if you've memorized your keys, the government would not be able to get them.

He buys his food from a farmer who accepts bitcoins.
You say probably a lot.
Again, how are you going to stop the farmer from accepting btc?
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:47:13


This is the key part, how can they get it? (aasuming i'm the only one who knows it, by memory.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:13:50


Continue using it? How are they going to ban it?
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:52:55
Probably not a lot, but its very easy to memorize it (and probably a good idea if you are doing that kind of deals).
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:16:54
In most cases yes, blockchain is only usefull if you keep it descentralized and to do that you need and incentive for individuals (a coin perhaps) to secure it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:54:47


Of course, there's a few countries that had try that. Didn't work btw.


lol, but probably bitcoin will be worth 100 quintillion dollars so who cares if it drops 80%.
I used ''probably'' in the same way as you btw.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:58:13
New question: Why would you ban bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-03 19:28:21
They put sanctions for various reasons.


Maybe because you haven't answered them?
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:00:12
Any lambos?
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:38:04
I know, but probably cryptos won't be banned so, case closed.
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:36:23
But they can.
@_date: 2019-09-03 17:48:38
lets assume that All cryptocurrencies are banned, how are you or anyone going to stop me paying John 0.1 btc for his Bike?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:29:35
Exactly, for all those use-cases, its better to use a database.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:53:56
lol, yeah and if he hadn't been born we wouldn't be talking about him right now.
