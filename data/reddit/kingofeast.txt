Actually, this is kind of the information I am looking to hear from South Koreans. That is why I embedded a question asking people if they really hear a lot about the Korean situation.


Yeah, could you fill us in about what South Koreans are feeling about the tension right now?
Also, what is the reason for the crazy price in Korea right now?  Exchange withdrawal problem?

Ouch. Hope both sides show some restraint.  
Do South Korea and North Korea have nukes? I just did a Google search. South Korea does not have nukes, but North Korea does. Doesn't sound very comforting.
What are the names of India's big exchanges? I am really curious about the price there.

tl;dr; Price in Korean exchange is crazy high because of tension with North Korea
Hi guys, I was reading 8btc and saw an interesting comment. Someone thinks that the ridiculous premium on Korean market is due to increasing belligerent stance of North Korea leader.
At first, I brushed it off as another wild theory because I didn't see too much news regarding Korean situation. What is your opinion? Did you hear a lot about the Korean situation?
Then I think deeper. If tension is indeed increasing, Koreans might diversify their asset out of Korean fiat. That part makes sense. Nevertheless, most people would have diversified to gold and US dollars.
That got me thinking more. Let's say a South Korean diversified to gold and US dollars, but those assets are stored in South Korean banks. When push comes to shove, that might not help him. On the other hand, if he holds cryptocurrency, it will still help him if he has to go abroad in short notice.
Now, that makes sense to me, provided South Koreans are actually really worried about the tension.
