Yes and no, 98% of customer funds are stored "offline". Take that how you will. 2% is "hot" I guess you could say and is covered "in the event of a breach in coinbase's online storage". The money you have in the "USD wallet" in your coinbase account is FDIC insured should coinbase become insolvent. So if your paying attention to where your money is, its pretty safe and insured by the US government. People dont like coinbase, but they made buying crypto REALLY FUCKING EASY.

What's risky about it? The money you have in your account is federally insured just like any other bank

The money you deposit into a coinbase account IS FDIC INSURED.

It takes literally a few seconds to transfer money from one of your wallets to the USD wallet.

I'm effectively saying that since it only takes a few seconds to move your money around from non insured to insured its pedantic/nit-picky to say only the USD wallet is insured.

Gross. Get this poor away from me

I wouldn't really call it a scheme though. People want things they cannot afford. They get around this through financing. If people weren't willing to take out massive loans to buy a massive house then there wouldn't be companies/banks offering these mortgages. Cant blame a company for seeing an opportunity to make money when really it's the consumers fault not taking the time to plan out their finances.

I'll insure your BTC. Just send me $50 a month and if you lose your keys I'll pay you back in full the amount of BTC you currently own at that time

Not a chance in hell. Humans are always going to steal, cheat, harm, and take advantage of one another. Bitcoin isn't ganna change that.

Wow, I'm surprised. How were they able to obtain smartphones and wifi?

An African village in the bush doesn't have access to a bank/atm but they have an internet connection, computers, and a sufficient way to trade bitcoin for goods/services?
