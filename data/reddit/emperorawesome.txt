If I had to guess (and I do without a full transaction list), one of those "legitimate" wallets has engaged in enough illegitimate activity to get noticed, regardless of how above-board their dealings with you were.  
Something that stood out to me though:


Could you clarify what that means? Did you move bitcoin in such a way as to avoid coinbase's built-in transaction fee?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:56:10
Ah, moving on then. I was going to attempt to contribute to a change, the same move that causes all societal change, but fuck me, right? I guess not. Good call, thanks for saving me the trouble. You're the hero we deserve.

Any call or put is just a wager on where you think the price is going to be at a specific date, a lot of money can be made or lost in futures markets. The threat here is that a handful of people can manipulate the price of cryptocurrencies if they hold enough, as we saw when BCH backers exchanged thousands of BTC for BCH. 
When a significant amount of a cryptocurrency is sold all at once, it causes a lower market valuation, causing a certain percent of average people to panic sell, further decreasing the asset's value. 
What can and has occurred in the case of BTC is that a handful of bajillionaires buy puts, and then sell a significant amount of bitcoin in concert the day of expiry in order to ensure they can sell those puts at a profit, with which they can buy more BTC than they sold and repeat. 
This combined effort is illegal in regulated markets, since it essentially ensures guaranteed profits on a bet for those that are in a position to trade at high volume and collude to manipulate the market, but it's difficult to enforce with crypto futures trading due to monitoring practices not yet being in place.

You say "your bank" but they go by how the transaction is coded. For my part, I'd love to see coinbase code its transactions as business services so I can start to see 3% back in points. Visa MCC  would work nicely.

This is genuinely concerning. You've made it clear you don't know why they're doing this, so let's try to find it in their terms of service.
1. How did you buy bitcoin?  
-Was it only through their site, or did you transfer from other exchanges?  
Did you use wire transfer, ACH, or credit?  
2. Where did you move bitcoin?  
-Did you purchase goods for it?  
-Did you move it to other exchanges?  
3. Did you receive any bitcoin you didn't purchase?  
-Did you exchange goods or services for bitcoin?  
-Did you mine any bitcoin to that wallet?  
4. What was your GDAX activity, if anything?  
-Did you use GDAX or just buy/sell via Coinbase?  
-What was your trading strategy/volume?  
No one item I've suggested for answering violates their terms and conditions by itself, but I'm confident we can figure out as a community what happened here, some sort of pattern has to emerge. If it's the difference between something we're all engaging in now, like exchange trading or mining, and there's one little variable that causes an account to be closed, we all need to know about it.

Exactly. So many people (relative term given the small percentage of the population) involved in bitcoin buy it as if it was a stock rather than engaging in mining, starting bitcoin-based businesses, etc. I keep on trying to shake people of my generation by the lapels and say "THIS IS OUR CHANCE! THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR LIVES AND ESCAPE!" And I always get "it's fake money". Even from people who own bitcoin. Think bigger.

Following a failed BTC segwit fork, a minority of whales simultaneously shifted funds toward the BCH network while generating thousands of microtransactions on the BTC network. This had the twofold effect of looking like a huge selloff of BTC in favor of BCH, driving the prices in opposite directions on exchanges, and clogging up the BTC network, attempting to prove a point that the network can't be used for transactions, when that's only true when the biggest movers are artificially creating a financial ddos attack. The really nefarious part is that these microtransactions were in such small amounts that the transaction fees themselves cost more than the money being transferred. They were really, truly invested in trying to crash bitcoin in order to profit from bitcoin cash. The lesson learned was that a wealthy minority can have a devastating effect on the economy with digital currencies just as easily as they've always done with fiat currencies.

Assuming he's in the US and bought from bitmain directly, and used fedex (cheapest option), accounting for about $50 on top for import fees per miner/psu, AND bought the bcash immediately before payment creating a 1:1 value from USD to BCH, 27 S9's cost him $46,710, run about $3,000 per month before cooling (no idea of his efficiency there), and pulls down 1.75 BTC per month at the current difficulty. Still crazy good profit margins, I don't get why people claim mining isn't profitable. I mean, I do, it's the penny-wise pound-foolish narrow view, but starting a business is expensive. This business is a-boomin'. Let's not forget that he'll be able to sell those units for at least what he paid for them on ebay or amazon when it comes time to buy 7nm miners. ROI is only a factor when adding units, not replacing them.

To be fair, the implosion danger comes when there's no mainstream adoption. Now that bitcoin is being legally recognized as currency and the Chicago futures market is stepping in, I'm not particularly concerned with that possible eventuality. We know what blockchain transactions should look like, but mainstream adoption won't suffer even if the average transaction time is 96 hours, since the best they've seen before using any cryptocurrency is 3-5 day ACH transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:23
Hard to get your hands on antminers direct from bitmain. They're constantly 90 days back-ordered and require you to buy in bcash. PLUS, I for one had to use a data center that charges me 4k/month per cabinet (supports 26 miners max), since I didn't have the room in my house for a dedicated HVAC setup. The hope is that after my current data center lease is up I'll be able to buy a fixer-upper house to lower my overhead costs. Still crazy profitable vs. industries like retail and restaurants.

As others have noted, large transactions can take a week or two, I wouldn't be too concerned. Here's what you do in the meantime to get ready to trade as soon as your funds are deposited:  
Step 1: Open a browser and go to kraken.   
Step 2: in 3-5 business days kraken's cloudflare error page will pop up. Hit F5.  
Step 3: Welcome to the year 2018. Attempt to place a trade with your new deposit.  
Step 4: On the 27th attempt your dollars should now be bitcoins.  
Step 5: Transfer bitcoins to a functional exchange.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:16:51
You've just gotta assume whatever you're mining is cut in half in June 2020 and add more hashing power to compensate. That's pessimistic single loss expectancy planning. It isn't as bad as all that, though, as transactions pay more than your share of new bitcoins mined by terahash. Mining is incredibly misunderstood.

There's a very real chance it can't be a currency if we wait, though. The IRS has already declared it an asset by taxing it at the capital gains rate rather than the regular income rate.

I can't say that I've ordered in the quantity that the author did, but have still bought plenty of antminers. The overall value of the shipments were always enough to require me to fill out a customs clearance form.  
I'm not saying bitmain is a great company, they have less than stellar quality control, change their payment policy frequently, and charge based on the current value of a bitcoin, which is unethical; I'm excited to see a growing number of companies working on asic hardware this year.  
Having said that, the author's poor writing, hysterical tone, and implied misunderstanding of import protocol all makes me reluctant to put the blame on bitmain in this instance. Not only do they always provide invoices (even if it is usually after the ship date), but those same invoices need to be provided to the carrier in order for the shipment to be made, and I have a hard time believing UPS or FedEx just picked up 400 boxes and moved them out of China without any paperwork.  
Furthermore, while I never looked up the trustpilot score of bitmain prior to reading this post, the only legitimate complaints I could find were in reference to bitmain's poor quality control and history of selling used hardware as new. These practices do not reflect well on a company of their size, and I sincerely hope that when 7nm miners are on the market I have the opportunity to purchase them from samsung, gmo, or some other company. I'm still gonna have to call bullshit on this guy's complaint from what I was able to read in his meandering, childlike scribbling.

I'm just glad I made a small visa purchase on coinbase in the narrow window before being blocked but after they started charging it as a cash advance so I can get in on the inevitable class action lawsuit.  
The U.S. government, via the IRS, has taken the position on bitcoin that it is property rather than currency, making every cash advance charge fraudulent. What a time to be alive.

When your business is manufacturing a product, a calculation is made prior to that product's launch on what the price needs to be in order for people to buy it, while still recouping manufacturing costs. Most electronics manufacturers aim to turn a profit at around the 1 year mark. If anything, the product may decline in price as the market becomes saturated. You can't just change your price every month based on a fake potential consumer ROI metric, that's not how a reputable company operates, it's not how goods are sold, and it runs counter to corporate ethical standards.

I figured that would be fine, but with no windows and only that one vent there's literally zero air movement in or out of the room except for the door, which I have completely sealed with weather stripping. I treat it like an outside door for noise blocking, so I want to get to the point I can keep it closed. I kept it closed for a day and it got dangerously hot down there just from the one miner.

Never tell your wife about personal investments. Retirement accounts make a great decoy, they're gonna be discovered by the lawyer. Let's say you want to set aside 10% of your income to retirement.

You probably should be careful with your investments. Let's take a look at what bitcoin is and how it works.  
21,000,000 will be mined by 2140.  
Nearly 17,000,000 have been mined. We'll probably have mined about 19,000,000 by the end of 2022.  
About 4 million are estimated "permanently" lost. Unless quantum computing makes SHA256 decryption trivial, or some agreement a la 'move your bitcoin within one year and any unmoved bitcoin will be redistributed' we'll take that out of the estimated bitcoin in circulation.  
So at 15,000,000 in five years, if it becomes widely adopted as a de facto reserve currency, as its strongest current use case implies, that's a complete cash replacement.  
Global cash in 2022 will be at a total worth of about $100 trillion. This is just cash, not hard assets, stocks, debt, or any less quantifiable wealth.  
So that's bitcoin taking the reserve of $100,000,000,000,000 distributed among 15,000,000 coins, justifiably valuing each coin at about 6.5 million USD.  
$150k is in no way delusional when you understand the driving factors of price. On the low end, the lowest crash can only meet the minimum electrical break even cost for mining, which will also rise. Now, that's a considerable range, with $150k being a conservative valuation point.

Adblock gate. Disgusting.  
"As I write this, I am listening on YouTube to the US SEC/CTFC Senate Testimony On Cryptocurrencies that took place earlier this week.
I'm halfway through and have another hour to listen to, but I am hearing sense, intelligence, curiosity, compromise, integrity, duality and discussions on regulation that are far removed from the recent hysteria about cryptocurrencies.
The discussion around ICOs can wait for another day, but such a Senate debate may indeed be historic in the way both old money and new money decided to work together. It makes a nice change...literally. Maybe the world changed on February 6th.
At present, bitcoin appears to be a target for every vested interest and enemy because of its very disruption. This is only to be expected, but if the Senate Testimony on Cryptocurrencies is of historicity, then the advent of the blockchain is likely to shake history, not just change it.
Whether it's humanitarian aid, refugee status, global citizenship, healthcare, reliable elections and (obviously) banking, the blockchain is likely to transform Real Data into True Data, as long as its source is pure.
It will also change and improve the current, and probably irreparable, internet. The blockchain is True Data; we need it.  
Others, somewhat younger than this correspondent, appear to agree. Step forward 22-year-old American, Evan Luthra, who has developed and delivered work for Fortune 500 companies such as CitiBank, Volkswagen Group, Google and and many others.  
He is an accredited angel investor and invests in a variety of products and businesses through his startup studio and other channels. Luthra also describes himself as the 'first-ever investor over SnapChat'.
Luthra is heavily involved in the cryptocurrency industry with positions at companies such as Gazecoin.io and is regarded as a blockchain authorithy and pioneer by global organizations, conferences and publications.
Lucid in conversation, Luthra says Gazecoin is a platform that is trying to incentivize users, content creators and advertisers. It charges on the basis of the amount of time a user gazes at the advertisements; the unit of this coin being so-named ‘gaze’.
Gazecoin wants to open up a new and different market segment for developers in the VR/AR segment and also to the advertisers to market their product in the platform and in return pay in the form of this currency.
"With the recent hype around cryptocurrencies we have seen a influx of new projects bringing in blockchain to a very diverse set of industries. Just through my investment bank, I have seen pitches for blockchain-based disruption for AdTech, Human Resources, hospitality Real Estate, finance and many more.
"Most importantly, I am also working with multiple governments to promote more transparent governance by using the blockchain starting with elections and going as far as putting all the citizens of a country on a blockchain-based ID system," says Luthra.
Elsewhere, blockchain is already making its significant presence felt in life-changing ways.
A recent report from analyst G2 Crowd points out with its Digital Trends data that the blockchain is already impacting on humanitarian aid. Groups are already using blockchain to give displaced persons their identities back.
Examples include the the Finnish government distributing blockchain-backed debit cards to asylum-seekers and the World Food Program is scanning people’s irises to let them buy groceries at a refugee camp in Jordan. 
Thus, blockchain becomes a matter of identity and ownership, as well as eternal trust and True Data and is the weird and wonderful world of bitcoin that made it possible,
While traditional money markets currently stumble and the world's cryptocurrencies oscillate with swings that would give most Wall Street traders coronaries, blockchain stands apart.
It may proof to be the biggest invention we have ever seen; time to thank bitcoin for its innovation and genius, not just what it represents as a financial disruptor,
(DISCLOSURE: I have no investments in bitcoin)."

Using a hybrid dictionary password cracking program, you can crack any password 12 characters or less in under a week on moderate hardware. You'll want to make a bootable USB drive since your OS drive is locked.
@_date: 2017-06-30 16:38:28
Here's the deal: The encryption used is going to be some sort of hybrid encryption, similar to Windows EFS or Bitlocker. In short, a relatively simple, symmetric cipher has encrypted your files, and the key to that (stored in the MFT header metadata for said files) has been generated using a more complex, asymmetric cipher.
Even if that sounded like Greek to you, don't panic! The key itself is then protected by a password. That's your weak point of attack to get this thing decrypted. In order, here are your steps:
1) Download l0phtcrack (or john the ripper, or cain and abel, all are good, I just like l0pht) and load it onto a USB stick. 
2) Disconnect the PC from the network.
3) Launch l0phtcrack (or whatever cracker) against the password for the ransomware.
4) Once you have your system decrypted, backup your wallet and re-install windows. There's other housekeeping you can do to avoid a re-install, but let's be two-condoms safe, here.
5) Install an anti-virus, secure your LAN (maybe as far as a MAC address whitelist), and stop going to sites that host malware.
