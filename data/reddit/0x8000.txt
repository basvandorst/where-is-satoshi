Roger Ver turns from Bitcoin Messiah to Bitcoin Death Angel
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:15:17
this is nothing comparing with 2013
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:22:20
they have decentralized white-napkin too
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:02:34
now you can wait until it hits 20k and buy back
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:26
Safe and stable crypto? Naaah!!!
@_date: 2018-09-12 12:20:52
Wow, such a hater
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:07:59
This article is so funny. Most amusing is point 6. "The lack of a central authority prevents the protocol from progressing." I feel that will take ages till people will realize that decentralization is the only solution. Central authorities/state already proved to be bad at everything except collecting taxes.

1) The parameters in bitcoin can't change unless majority agrees, this is how consensus works, if I'll change those parameters in my local application other peers will just render my blocks as invalid
2) while 51% attack is possible in theory, I doubt we'll ever see it in practice. Bitcoin network is more powerful than top 500 supercomputers combined.
3) Author has no clue about sidechains. 
5) Any ISP firewall can be bypassed, actually its a common practice in China, most of people have VPN's there.
6) This is most amusing point. The purpose of bitcoin is to bring decentralization, to eliminate any central authority. Bitcoin is actually a solution for currency liberalization where state or any central authority can't manipulate it.
8) Same answer as in 5,6
9) Same as in 5,6. Who cares about regulation
10) like said : "Seriously??"

Nice poem
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:37:52
it looks like giving both fingers, middle and index. It's volatile
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:05:18
Nobody cares, it's just a great opportunity for trading
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:16:27
who knows, this is crypto 
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:13:27
you still have to work for the second one

I think his plan was to get attention. Before that, nobody knew him. Now he's a known con artist, but a popular one. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:15:18
he missed the dip
@_date: 2016-03-13 07:16:11
Actually it will scale when Serentity will be launched (it should be around September if I recall correctly)
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:01:31
nice!!! though more details are needed.
    /** Assign 14 to an Integer
         x integer , result variable
         void

    public void assign14(Integer x)
    {
        x = 14; //14
    }

it's not a good idea to stare at the charts in traffic
@_date: 2016-11-16 14:06:05
because this is bitcoin's route: earth-&gt;moon-&gt;earth-&gt;moon-&gt;earth-&gt;moon-&gt;earth

For 18m you probably will need an attorney as well.

"Society has become less intelligent?
I remember times when some dude [Kashpirovsky]( claimed to heal people who watched his TV shows, and most people believed him.
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:27:37
he said dip. time to buy and re-sell on the next peak 
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:29:11
What's Beyonce?

Satoshi released Bitcoin as [free software]( but faketoshi would cut his arm only to patent it. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:06:28
He can't afford it anymore
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:36:24
Craig spotted
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:32:40
too expensive
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:38:12
He looks like a hodler
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:22:21
You should comply with the majority. When bitcoin rises just post "moon memes" when it corrects cry and panic. It shouldn't be complicated
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:47:52
 it's time to hodl
@_date: 2019-02-28 10:17:34
Wait!!! He's no prince?? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 08:23:27
money don't smell
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:19:28
Karpeles looks like baron Harkonen.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:16:57
why ten? hodl forever and just sell for your needs ( lambos and stuff) . Nobody wants a load of cash under pillow
@_date: 2019-01-11 14:37:24
In his glory moments he started to think that he owns the network, this eventually killed his business
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:01:46
I think that he just filled a market order 
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:50:57
Do you think that they need an legit argument for it? They just took the opportunity to make tons of money out of nothing. bcash will continue to exist just like etc does, same saga.
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:13:26
He should be suied for negligence. He could at least hire professional traders.
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:33:48
this is a bitcoin testnet address
@_date: 2015-04-14 09:37:17
The speed isn't the main concern. The real evil is the **runtime-interpreter**. Some really nasty bugs may be hidden deeply in code, that even with proper unit testing is hard to detect. And when codebase grows considerably these kind of bugs are more probably.
@_date: 2015-04-05 22:34:20
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:30:47
then it's time to buy ;)
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:02:47
So he's pumping it? 
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:18:47
yeah, I do it every morning instead of cardio. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:10:15
What?? No lines??
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:34:00
I just read your tweet. Looks stupid.
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:26:14
Now we want more :D. 3 days ago was whole 3 days ago
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:24:49
LOL, same thing every year :D. You forgot to render some colored lines, arrows, etc, on that chart. It would look more proffesional :D
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:17:46
you flayer !
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:48:29
It's a part of Bitcoin's traditions. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:35:47
nobody likes cheap things
@_date: 2018-12-16 13:04:20
It's greed when you sell. In 20 years when world will be driven by crypto you'll be ashamed that you sold bitcoin at $20K
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:00:47
Yes, you are the chosen one
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:41:35
but if you exchange bitcoin to fiat, you have to pay taxes, which usually are much higher than 3.5%
