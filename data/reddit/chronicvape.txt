yep,  Bitcoin is certainly going to be damaged.
Sure it will continue on,  people willing to gamble are going to stick around and of course people who believe in bitcoin being a new currency.
The average people who became interested and tried it on who now are burnt, gone.
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:46:40


yeah i'm sure you were saying that this time last year.
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:11:57
Its concerning.. I've been around in this stuff awhile.
No decent charts,  none of the exchanges are trustable, everyone suggesting you can't leave money anywhere.
Its really shit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:23:14
He is right though.  There is no reason to believe any exchange is safer.  Any of them could just pull the plug tomorrow and run.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:24:27
It might be damaged to the public, but there is no way BTC is going away.  Even if the value dropped to $30, it will still be here, it has its uses.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:35:39
I urged people to look at wall street and banks also for risks.
Remember that housing bubble n shit?
The whole world being affected?  Euro countries going down the shitter?
Oh no, LOOK AT BITCOINS THO OMG

everyone on here is bagging out mt.gox meanwhile there is people in the business and law world putting out their hands to help gox.
I think its important for everyone to be supporting Gox in anyway they can if they really give a shit about Bitcoin instead of calling users of Mt.Gox stupid and retarded etc.  Mt.Gox is connected to the Foundation,  do you understand how damaging it is to Bitcoin from the outside? 
If Mt.Gox folds its going to be a huge dent to Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:10:20
really simple.  Just move millions of dollars of bitcoins from cold storage then take a big risk moving them to a wallet to appease internet nerds mean while being investigated and being hounded to fix their system while being accused of stealing all the money and faking everything.
so simple.
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:52:09
would have been nice to withdraw my BTC so i could pay my electricity bill.
stupid me left it in there for months, went to pull it out and found the news.
fucking wankers.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:18:26
No exchange is safe. none.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:23:29
wow you must be BTC rich if you know it follows other bubble charts.
Of course there is no point mining, there wasn't months before ASICs turned up.  
You are 100% correct,  being an exchange is highly lucrative, and this is why i'm saying you can't trust any of them,  to  me this looks exactly the same as whats going on in those drug markets.  New ones are springing up, they are all giving each other bad PR then eventually they just close up shop with everyones money.
There is nothing stopping this from happening from the "legit" exchanges and its very bad and i'm hoping that BTC evolves from here.
BTC still could be the real deal, it allows very easy movement of money. 
I don't know why you went off like a nutter for.  It might be overvalued, but this is what you get with a new currency, its going to be bumpy ride for along time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:10:32
Yeah, best just to ignore all this bullshit from this subreddit and wait for facts.
There has been none,  a bunch of exchanges waiting to get their grubby hands on new investors just announced the biggest exchange was insolvent.
Filled with dodgy shit.  No one is going to take BTC seriously while all this is going on.  Not just dodgy exchanges, but wankers comming out and giving their opinions.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:12:18
its a developing currency.  A currency that will now be pushed back and will evolve into a better technology.
You don't need to use media fear invoking words like "bubble" ..
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:22:06
No one listens because you do your trades and get your money out.
Understand the risks and play the game how you feel.
All this bullshit about warning people every day is laughable..  Seems to me more of an effort to damage BTC-e which is a important site for crypto right now.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:04:55
just remember friend,  life is a sine wave, you are just on the downwards slide, you'll come back up.  Good luck mate.
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:05:25
thats cheap beer
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:43:08
they are keen to make cash off the back of it thats for sure.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:15:13
They are better than most because of the way they operate.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:07:07
lol everyone hates on BTC-E yet they have been great to everyone i have seen deal with them.
@_date: 2014-03-03 09:44:55
That doesnt sound suspect at all.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:35:56
yep its getting really fucking bad too.
I work in IT in a place where i'm dealing with multiple enterprise portals our users connect to.
Some work with IE8 only.. or IE9 and 10 only, but only after you set 30 settings to make it work which then renders another site with issues.
Windows xp, Windows 7, windows 8 ..  no this software only works on one, or the other, or both but only in 32bit on windows 7 and 64bit on windows 8 after this patch.
Goes on and on and on, i'm getting fed up with it, where has all the fucking standards gone?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:41:15
lol ok
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:26:49
I really suspect there is a push to damage btce.. 
Always random people suggesting how bad it is.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:14:47
Reminder:  Someone posts something bad about BTC-e every day in an effort to damage them.
Mods should create a Stick that states clearly that you CANNOT TRUST ANY EXCHANGE AND NOT TO LEAVE MONEY IN THEM, then ban any continuing "BTC-E IS BAD" threads.
This is bullshit and i'm sure there is agents out there attempting to create problems in the cryptocurrency world.
If BTC-e is so important to crypto right now, its the biggest target for these attacks and the community should be blocking them.
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:15:27


GET EM!
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:27:31
$$$$ makes things work.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:21:15
the amount stolen in the last few years makes it seem you are better of investing in stealing than actually using the coins.
@_date: 2012-08-01 23:39:19
Just a bit of a side question to losing a wallet.
But, wouldn't it be best to store or at least backup your wallet to a cloud service? or is there a problem here i don't see yet?
The likely hood of losing access to your google drive account would be low if you are setup properly with android phone and a gmail account.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:02:42
Is there even any proof that this news had any affect?
Look at the 3 huge movements here: 
Someone dropping bulk coins smashed the market?
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:58:32
Get an address and  make a qr code?
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:03:08
Another place to make money.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:15:47
The whole world economy is a ponzi scheme then.  Top 1% own 80% of wealth.. ponzi everyone! Going to collapse ha ha !
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:11:12
In other news, finance industry manipulates markets, makes rich people richer and the public pay for broken companies.
