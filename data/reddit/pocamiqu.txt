The Vault is the safest way to store your coins, even tech experts have lost their coins they stored by themselves, there are so many ways you can lose the coins.

I don't think so, volatility is decreasing not only because the China exchanges adjustments, but because people is seeing more clearly through all the FUD bullshit, so the dumps/crashes/panic-selling is decreasing dramatically over time. Last few times, even with the huge Bitfinex scandal and then with the POBC investigations, on both occasions the price recovered very quick and the dips/crashes were smaller.

Tell them to fuck off. You can't leave on fear because there is a 0.000000001% chance they are not bluffing. Virtually everything represents a higher risk to your family than this threat.

No way, every time this happens (China FUD), the recovery is faster. As time passes, more countries entry the game, scooping all those cheap Chinese panic-sold coins. So, this is good for decentralization of bitcoin distribution/ownership.

No, they know for a fact he has twins because it's so easy to know that and much more personal info just by checking his social media. So, in both cases, it's just a scam.

Please stop spreading FUD about ALL exchanges, do not generalize, we are far away from MtGox times. We have now secure exchanges like Gemini.com or Coinbase.com that are fully licensed and regulated by the US Government and Agencies, they comply with all KYC/AML laws and regulations.
Coinbase Vault is very safe for storage, they store &gt;99% of bitcoins offline in cold storage, so they can't be hacked/stolen. If you are not tech savvy (like &gt;99% of world population) it's much more probable that you end up losing them (for many reasons) if you store them yourself.

Nitpicking much? You mean, after gaining 100%.... or 10,000%? It all depends on the time scale, but it always ends upward. You say the exact same thing people said when it hit $1, then $10, then $100, now at $1000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000.... and so on. And when it corrects just 20% from the last 100% gain, they yell: "CRASH!, I Told you so!"... Bitcoin is back today to over $900, the price it was last week after a small correction following a quick spike over $1000. Check bitcoin cycles (“bubbles”) history, it always ends up higher than the previous high.

How is that bad for bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a Chinese market (90% trading in China) and not a global market. Most mining is done in China.
That is a false premise, the fact that most mining is done in China does not exclude bitcoin for being a global market.




That has been debunked, just like they gave even less chanced for Trump and Brexit to win. The general consensus is that the ETF will be approved 'by default' (they won't decide one way or the other) so the have plausible deniability and can wash their hands if the ETF fails or claim credit if it is a success.


Again, false premise, one does not exclude the other. Moreover you may want to read the article again, everything points out the administration will be favorable to bitcoin with the likes of Mulvaney and Thiel in high positions and close to Trumps ear.
