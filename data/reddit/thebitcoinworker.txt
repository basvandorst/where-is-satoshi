If the bitcoin community do not loudly call this scam out then when it comes crashing down media will say onecoin like bitcoin bla bla bla.
If we at least keep calling out this scam we as a community can call out bad Journalists by pointing to all the times we have warned others and good journalists will be able to find out that we have been trying to expose the onecoin scam for a long time.

Thanks man, I'll let you know

But people have left btc because the fees are too high and now the fees have gone down. This basically means that the network effect gets people into bitcoin and then the leave for an alt that is cheaper and faster or they leave all together back to fiat.

The CEO also wanted to sue Andreas M Antolopolous for using the term "internet of money" Then when it came out the CEO of uphold said something like, Why would we sue some random that I have never heard of! 
So they are a bitcoin business that's never heard of Andreas M Antolopolous? Thier numbers are also very over bloated that no one believes them.

The free market creates neutrality, because I know I would change ISP if I found out I was being throttled for some content. And others I have talked to feel the same.

This is great, thanks for the link. One thing I don't understand is, ok so the user knows he is part of the merkle tree, great, all good here, But what good is it when that merkle tree is made from the exchanges database. what do they compare it to? They still need to show the address(s) with the cold storage coins on them so they can compare the root sum of the merkle tree to the cold + hot storage coins. or what am I missing?
EDIT: I guess what i'm saying is that, ok, now there is a Merkle proof-of-liabilities but now we need the other side of that which is proof of assets.
Also how does signing a message with the private keys work? does that expose the public key?

Oh great! I'll definitely use this. Hey, any chance of including a bitcoin/silver order book?
@_date: 2016-03-16 20:44:25
Bitgold is not a bitcoin exchange, it's just a gold shop that happens to take bitcoin through bitpay. There is no order book so you can only take their price. And worst of all you can't pay out in bitcoin. They took a great name and concept and have done sweet F all to really make it bitcoin friendly. I expected way more.

I dont trust Xapo at all for trading into gold because of the no fee thing, it usually means they are selling my data.  I use Vaultoro, they have a really good transparency protocol, they have been around for about 4 years and use a vaulting facility I used to use my self. I just wish they offered silver pair, they have been saying they would add it for years but never seems to happen.
I tried using goldmoney but they dont let me trade back to crypto like vaultoro does. I do like that Xapo has a debit card though. I think they were the first back into the day.

Ok, but then how will miners have an incentive if the fees for settling LN transactions are not higher?
My understanding is that Satoshis game theory was that TX fees would take over from mining rewards because tx volume would be enough by the time rewards get to low.
So I thought LN channel operators would pay a bigger fee to settle a heap of transactions in 1 go.
i'm just trying to understand it better.
@_date: 2016-12-25 09:37:42

This is why i use HTTPS://vaultoro.com to trade into and out of gold and bitcoin. This whole 15 percent crap was too crazy but i wanted to diversify. Gold bullion at vaultoro is fully insured and audited which is why i chose that over a tether or some other crap stablecoin. 
Anyway just wanted to let you know that there are way better ways to diversify into physical gold.

Drop tether! I trade in and out of physical allocated gold because it's insured and audited. Tether isn't audited, can't be insured.

You are very wrong. The credit card system is a pull system and is centralised so charge backs as well as massive amounts of thefts are very costly. Bitcoin is a push system where the user pushes a payment. No charge back fraud and theft can only happens  to centralised honey pots but individual wallets are very hard to get. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:53:58

@_date: 2015-07-15 08:23:48
Interesting link, I know what you mean about fees,  but I would rather be on an exchange that I know is making money by charging something for the service. I'm always suspect of exchanges with no trading fees at all.  I want an exchange that I'm using to be profitable so they can afford to stay secure. It can't be cheap and must be a lot of work running an exchange. 
I remember using bullion vault years ago and talk about expensive. When you take bank fees and everything else into consideration the time and money it took was silly. Bitcoin makes all that way easier, faster and cheaper. I wonder if vaultoro will do silver soon too because it would be nice to trade between the two. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:03:14
Alts fail? We are in the era of digital assets now. All sorts of things will be tokenised. Web 3.0 is the internet of value. Bitcoin will be what everyone will price in. Its fiat that should fail
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:10:56
I used to think the same but then using vaultoro or bitreserve you can really see the value in holding gold and easily spending it with bitcoin anywhere bitcoin is accepted. The other thing is that vaultoro let you buy and sell milligrams so I think that's about 5 cents worth. That's pretty cool too because gold denominations don't that small is hard but bitcoin makes it possible. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 06:04:04

Yeah its it full reserve Which is great but the money I deposit with them is their property, there are bullion dealers that take bitcoin and store the bullion as your property which is important to me. 
@_date: 2019-06-14 07:33:59
Hahaha yet they trade in tether. Insurance companies know the risk, that's all they know and they are good at assessing and pricing it. That's what they do. Now, If you try to insure gold at home then its extraordinarily expensive. Insuring gold that is secured in a high security vaulting facility like the Vaultoro use costs little close to zero because insurance knows how good they are. I also have some gold at home but not much because 
A. It's not liquid and B its dangerous
@_date: 2015-07-26 15:33:37
I don't like that the ceo said they will speculate with users money to make profits. I don't like that I don't own the money that I put in. It's not secured as my property.

Https://vaultoro.com was the first orderbook exchange to ever incorporate lightning and its regulated in the UK. But it's only pair is bitcoin / physical gold.
They say they are launching a new version with new pairs as well as silver. But they have been saying that for a while so whi know. But I like the gold angle. It's the only exchange in the world that does physical allocated. I just wish they would add silver. Been holding out for ages. Their dev team seems either slow or (my hope) thorough.
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:58:46
I think it's regulated in NY and the Winklevoss twins are behind it. It's just overcolateralised loans

I wish they would make it like xapo where you spend the bitcoin when you use the card. I don't want to convert bitcoin to fiat sitting in a card that I can use. I want to hold bitcoin and when I use the card it converts at time of use only the amount I need.

You either didn't watch the whole thing or you are a corrupt heartless asshole. I've been here since late 2010 and also watched the whole thing and the whole thing stinks to high heaven. The whole investigation, case, trial and outcome is a massive corrupt scandal.

It's funny, it's kind of like if Amazon would accept bitcoin. It would make bitcoin very valuable because it's use case jumps orders of magnitude. 
The USD being used in oil trades is very important to the US gubment because of the same reason. They need use cases for velocity and they are willing to kill millions of people for it through war, derailing sovereign countries, sanctions  and so on.
This is something bitcoin can never do. Thank fuck

That's right that's why it can't afford to pay devs. Its not a company

Will 2 people need to be on the same channel to transact?
Will it take 10 minutes for me to join a channel because of confirmation?
Will channels centralise because of network effect? (Well everyone is using xyz channel, so I will because then I can transact with more people?)
Will Channel operators be anonymous or reputation based?
Will Channel Operators end up being regulated?
@_date: 2016-09-17 17:01:29
The intention is for bitcoin to scale to mainstream adoption where there are as many transactions per second as visa. I think there will be way more because we will have machines entering the economy. Anyway each tx has a small fee

I like Vaultoro because they are the only ones with a BTC / physical gold pair. I have been in the btc game long enough to see fiat exchanges get their bank accounts frozen, they dont tell anyone and then they go into natural ponzi schemes because of the frozen accounts. Gold is also insured. I just wish they had silver as well.

Thanks for the explanations. 


So how does that work? do I have to scan their QR code and then find out I'm not somehow connected? Or do payment channels connect to other payment channels which connect to other payment channels? 


When you say counterparty, do you mean the channel operator or the person I am paying? 
If you mean channel Operator, why would they tie up funds? do they have incentives to lock up funds?
Thanks for taking the time. This is important info.

Only if naked short selling is allowed. 
Naked short selling is very different to normal short selling. 
Naked short selling is when JPmargin (for example) Don't borrow any of the stock, they just sell what they don't have. 
Here is an explanation of the illegitimate practice which has been used to destroy perfectly good publically listed companies. 
In fact, Overstock.com was almost destroyed by NAKED shorts.

Http://vaultoro.com doesnt take any KYC for less than 5000 usd worth of bitcoin per day! I'm not sure what bit gold will do. But that's the beauty of gold, not so much KYC. Sad that bitreserve has this but then they do take fiat so they probably have to.

Its like when they changed the word servers to cloud and now database to blockchain. Lol 
@_date: 2015-09-29 07:38:23
Banks don't want to use the word bitcoin but at the end of the day they will use it because internal centralised blockchains are a bit pointless, we already have those, they are called databases because a centralised  blockchain could be reversed so data going in could be changed. They will end up using bitcoin as a payment network because it's way way cheaper than paying 2 or 3 intermediary banks to transfer money. Just how phone companies ended up using TCIP and VoIP protocols to connect foreign phones instead of connecting to 2 or 3 intermediary phone carriers to connect international phone calls. 
Bitcoin is the most secure network the world has seen and will end up being used. It will be hard for banks as they make a lot of money by being trusted agents who take a cut for international transfers by linking 2 untrusted banks that don't have agreements together. But at the same time it will be cheaper for customers to use bitcoin in the middle so they will end up using it. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:45:26
so how many factoids will it cost to enter some data? and how many factoids make up one factom?

Blame stupid regulations. It must suck to say this to your own customers. :(

To be fair he actually wants to share the full block reward (which he is already fully getting) with full node operators, to promote people running a full node. It's the opposite of greed. I actually agree with him. I have been running a full node for years and it does cost me a fair bit in electricity, bandwidth and drive space, so I would love if some of the block reward was also given to people like me.

Well, I do it for moral reasons. I feel fiat is a systemically corrupt system. So it makes me feel good exiting fiat. 
It also makes me buy quality and not cheap shit that's going to break. Because I'm spending precious rare numbers and not fiat. I don't want to buy crap and then it break. The bear market sucks but I feel good because I'm getting btc cheaper. 
I'm more minimal now because I buy less and like I said above buy only quality that costs a bit more but will last.
