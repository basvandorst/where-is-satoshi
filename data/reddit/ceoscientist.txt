Yea I had nothing to talk about at Christmas, so the conversion to all my friends and family went towards Bitcoin because i had a huge fan in the roof and about 12 new power points in the main room where i ran 36 280x's for ltc mining last year, which they were curious about. When they go home to search "bitcoin" and read about it on wikipedia within the first few paragraphs they will read about that. Now they all think i am pedo. Ew.

I like how price tanks always happen 1-2 days before any sort of news is given. I smell of complete bullshit.

because litecoin just got asics, the price was super high --&gt; huge hashrate of asics come on board mining the shit out of it, dumping it all, hence the price goes to crap. It'll pass $55 one day- maybe if bitcoin rises, since litecoin is almost like a derivative of bitcoin

Not right what he's doing but you seriously have to be retarded to invest in scamcoins. I thought investing in Bitcoin was bad enough. And talk about being gullible so easily trusting someone... let it be a lesson for you and thank your lucky stars it wasn't all of your money. Maybe you'll use your head next time.

You should be hating on the govt. thieves that seized all of Mt.gox assets as part of the Silk Road investigation. Ivestigators were probably like, who cares if we screw over all of their customers, they were probably drug dealers any ways. We'll put everyone on a gag order so we don't look bad.

doesn't matter how many places you have to buy them, if there is no incentive to actually buy them :-)

they could just make bitcoin the "backbone", and put float inflationary 'experimental' localised currencies that can help point economic growth to certain areas. People holding the BTC can preserve their wealth?  idk
