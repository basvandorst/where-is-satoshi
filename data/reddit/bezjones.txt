How can we use it for transactions when fees are so high? What do you think is the fix for that? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:50:59
Great reply. Thanks. 
As someone who enjoys reading about cryptocurrencies but probably doesn't understand them as well as you do, one of the things I seem to understand has been a hurdle and continues to be a hurdle is the large transaction fees. If bitcoin is used as a 'reserve' in the way gold was/is then obviously that isn't a problem but if it's to be used as a 'currency' that definitely is. 
Why do you think BTC hasn't been able to 'solve' this 'problem' yet? There seem to be other cryptocurrencies that have. Are there any of those that stand out to you as future contenders for a main global currency? What does Bitcoin have (apart from currently larger market share) that they don't? 
Bonus question if you feel like it, but if you were to build the perfect crypto, what would it be a combination of? For example, the hashpower of ETH, the peer-to-peer trustless electronic cash protocol of BTC, the minimal transaction fees of Litecoin, the blockchain size of BCC, etc. (These are completely random examples, I'm not actually saying those are the coins with those attributes or that they are desirable)

Etoro ads have been on the underground a while now and many of them have included bitcoin in their ads

I've been buying BTC for almost a year now and still learning about the technical side of it (will probably never fully understand) but if you have any articles that were lightbulb moment for you, I'd love to check them out.

[Me reading your reply](
Thanks for taking the time to reply. I'm still learning (little by little).
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:56:07
Why though? Ethereum has grown pretty much at the same rate as BTC and it's like rule  of investing to diversify. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:33:01
I don't know their circumstances but there is a chance that they bought all their btc not long before the fork and tried to do it but couldn't. Verifying my id with coinbase when I first signed up was a major hassle and took weeks to finally accomplish. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:34:44
Yep. BTC 101 right there. My point was that we don't know if it was the former or the latter, either way, the user did say they tried to do it and couldn't.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:19:21
"Keep your coins in a wallet you control at all times" 
You're telling the user to do something he/she literally just said they tried to do and couldn't.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:36:27
And maybe he/she is new to btc and bought some only a couple weeks before the fork, assuming he/she could pull them out in time and then coinbase wouldn't let him/her. None of us know that. What we do know is they tried to take them out and put them in a wallet and couldn't. So saying "take them out and put them in a wallet, is pretty redundant advice"
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:23:53
I know you're joking but why is it such a big deal that I used he/she because I don't know if the poster is a guy or girl???

You can disagree if you want. Doesn't change the fact that it objectively is a scam.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:30:42
Just go to and search "Dash" 9/10 links will be discussing why and how it's a scam.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:11:41
Don't trade alts to try and earn money. Invest in altcoins if you like the idea and the purpose behind them. Oh, and just like bitcoin: HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:10:15
Why are you blaming me for your app not working? Lol 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:21:32
Don't buy DASH. It's a scam
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:10:48
Yes. Segwit makes literally all altcoins redundant. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:22:43
Try Bitfinex, Binance, or Bittrex 
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:48:48
Scam: a dishonest scheme; a fraud.
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:27:42
Very insightful. Cheers 
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:00:13
Don't bother to explain or anything. Just insult. That's how good dialogue works right? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:31:24
I get that. But that's not a loss. 99.99 or anything lower is a loss. Anything higher isn't. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:18:52
Thank you. In the meantime, I've registered with blockchain and created a wallet and noticed how many extra security mesasures they had in place. 
Second question, as you can also buy and sell through blockchain.info, why would anyone use coinbase and not them? 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:24:01
No it wouldn't be like that at all. It would be like quintupling your money. You literally can't say you lost. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:34:16
Am I missing something? Are you guys reading a completely different comment than I am?
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:01:23
If you're only just learning about bitcoin you're not going to be mining. Just buying and selling.
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:06:42
This article isn't about fiat, it's about taxation, benefits, etc. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:33:35
Did you even read what that person put though? I don't understand how that even slightly addressed what they were saying? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 09:31:46
My trezor doesn't ship until August. Where do you recommend I move them to for the time being until that comes? I have some ETC as well so ideally a wallet that can store both BTC and ETC would be great. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:14:36
Eh? I'm not following. If you buy at $100, it goes up to an all time high of $1000 and you sell at $500, you've quintupled your investment. How can you say that's a loss? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:55:06
I would like to set this up but fear it's above my technical ability. Could you help me? I'd be using a mac.  
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:56:06
Ah ok. I did not know that. I assumed that although they were harder to come by you would still get .000000000000000001 btc per hour of mining or something like that. I thought it was more like a continual line with a very low return rate, when in fact you could potentially mine for thousands of hours and still have literally 0. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:14:25
It just looks like the pound symbol... of the three I like it the most 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:06:33
I'm still a bit confused as to what will happen to existing bitcoins in each circumstance (SegWit, SegWit 2x, UASF, UAHF). 
From what it sounds like, all current Bitcoin will be 'legacy' bitcoin and newly generated bitcoin from here on will either be UASF or UAHF. Can someone ELI5 please?  
And when I buy bitcoins on coinbase how will I know which chain I'm purchasing from? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:22:46
Gotcha. Do you mind answering a second question? Why do people run Bitcoin "full nodes" when there is no mining that goes on in that case. Is it completely altruistic for the cause of 'bitcoin'? As it seems to only cost money and not generate any income. 
And third question while we're at it. If you don't pay electricity bills and have unlimited internet allowance, why *wouldn't* you get some ASIC miners? Seems like a pretty fail proof why to make some bitcoin with only the startup cost of buying the ASIC miners. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:52:47
Interesting. Thanks for the reply. Mining and running nodes is a bit over my head for now but it's interesting to learn about. Cheers!
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:47:54
Ah ok. Good to know. I saw some miners such as Antminer S5 for 140 USD or SP20 Jackson for 90 USD. I guess setting it up incurs more cost though? 
(Apologies, I'm way over my head right now I realize. I'm trying to learn)

Great read. Thanks
