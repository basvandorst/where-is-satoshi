A few of things I noted:
* Only one screenshot 
* Horrible design, buttons are labels misaligned 
* Coming soon, really?
I would avoid, for now.

Slightly unrelated, but related to rushwallet.com. How do I export my private key?
@_date: 2014-07-06 18:16:36
Yes. I am sure more people think like me (and I held back!), but are afraid of minuses. Not me. :-)

The majority of those who *did not succeed* took the high risk path.

There is not "import brainwallet" on blockchain.info :-(

Hi, thanks for answering. I am trying to find a way to store my private key behind a mnemonic, basically.

At the moment, my personal wallet is a paper wallet. Coinbase generated a wallet for me, but I will transfer coins to my personal wallet, and leave some small balance on my Coinbase wallet for daily things --like tipping, for example :-)
Would you say that is a proper way to do it?

What are the advantages of running a node? Is there any personal gain?
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:19:09
It doesn't. Registration needed.

New to Bitcoin here. Could you send me $0.01? I created an account at Coinbase but they are taking their sweet time to deposit on my bank, so I can verify. I am experiencing the noob anxiety of "will my address work?" :-)

And it is down. At least, unreachable from SE USA.

Excellent explanation. Thank you! It would be nice if a standard were to be agreed upon.
