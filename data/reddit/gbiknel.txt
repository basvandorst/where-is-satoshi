Impossible to lose over a few days but I fluctuate quite a bit within 24hr. But for everyday I’m down I’m up 6 days lol

It’s a coin...Eth is a proof of work coin at the moment. Many other “coins” are just Ethereum ERC20 tokens.

Debit cards don’t have fees which is why places push them over CCs.

ETH was $1005 when I went to bed and $978 when I woke up...maybe he’s just really heavy into eth.

I lost $50 at the time, you get over it. Fucked me something good because I stopped using crypto for a long time after that.

Well I was just using BTC to pay for Usenet subscription. Is wasn’t investing and after the whole debacle it just made sense to stop using BTC for a while so I just stopped following it.

They’ve also discussed the possibility of “recovering” destroyed coin. Slippery slope but it’d be wallets that haven’t done anything in X time or something. Someone will surely get screwed and if regulators come in I’d bet it’s blocked.

Oh wouldn’t need private keys. You can see any addresses balance and transaction history. You’d basically blacklist the address not allowing it to use its coin and “create” new coins based on the balance. 
I agree it’s a terrible idea but it’s not impossible.
