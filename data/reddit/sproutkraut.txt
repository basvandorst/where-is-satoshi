This didn't really tell me anything, and when I search for BBQCoin, I get nothing that says anything about its "demise".

What do you mean? I just went to Kipochi's website and they seem to be just fine.

Which altcoins have their own blockchain? Monero is one of these, correct?

Saw this over at bitcointalk and have been going down the list. Thanks for shortening my learning curve.

Has it been profitable? I've been thinking about preordering an ASIC...

This entire post seems fake.

Thanks for the tip.

Can you run through what you do? Is it simply buy a bunch from an exchange and divide it up?

How long does that take? And when they see you do that, why don't they just do it themselves?

I hear that. I'm in a pocket of anti-govment rednecks who, if they learned a bit, would jump at the chance to buy some. I'm just curious how people go about selling in quantities like you are.

How long doors the verification process take?

As an organic farmer in the US, where can I find the resources to make a website like this?
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:39:12
Sorry, maybe that type didn't show up well on my phone, but if I get it right, you get cash, transfer to customer direct from your Coinbase wallet at some % above current market, grab a coffee while waiting for it to clear, then immediately buy more bitcoin. Right? Sounds simple enough. Have you ever been robbed?

Not to be a grammar Nazi, but I would change some of this wording.

It's not broken, as far as the Fed is concerned.

Figured someone could do this more quickly than I can on my phone. I'll help edit, though.
