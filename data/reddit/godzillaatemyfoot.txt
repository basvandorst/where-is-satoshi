They aren't.  I'm not mistaken.  You're wrong.  Only off chain is that possible and anyone can spot that a mile away.  They're not your bitcoins until they're committed on chain.

They will agree under those conditions.

All they have to do is say that's what they recommend.  Done.  
Put those changes in an upcoming Core release and all the miners will back it as well.

LiteCoin will do it for you.  They already have 4x the on-chain capacity as Bitcoin which is more than double what the miners initially wanted.

Plenty of people use LiteCoin.  That's just silly to say.  Of course blocks aren't half full, the block time is 4x faster than bitcoin.  Now with Segwit, they'll be a crap ton better than bitcoin even if it does get Segwit with the current block time/limit it has.

The value comes into play when you wake up to the fact that elites are literally creating fiat and giving it to themselves and with bitcoin, they can't.  If you don't understand that is what is happening and think our current monetary system is fair, you will never see the value in bitcoin.  
Go to youtube, look up fractional reserve banking, how money is created from thin air.  Then see if you can find detailed expenditures by the federal reserve banks listing EXACTLY all the inputs and outputs--not generalities or categories.  
The Federal Reserve banks are cheating like hell.  They do because they can.  It's that simple.  With bitcoin, they cant'.
Edit:  If they aren't cheating, they should be willing to create digital money where the public, who has a full right to know, can see all the inputs and outputs they have.   They will NEVER do that.

If Blockstream would agree to a HF of 4MB and Segwit everyone would do it.  
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:47:49
No one trusts Blockstream to EVER put that in Core.  
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:20:51
No you don't.  LiteCoin is already there.  That makes no sense unless you believe LiteCoin would just fall apart with full blocks.  It would not.
@_date: 2017-05-06 23:47:06
It is capable of 4x scale of bitcoin without segwit.  As litecoin starts to have more transactions, which they deserve since they have effectively increased the block size through block time, we can all judge whether Blockstream was selfishly lying or not--which we know they are.  There is no danger as LiteCoin will prove.

Of course the blocks aren't full.  They've got 4x the throughput of bitcoin.  Now, do they currently have the traffic bitcoin has...no.  They likely will soon though as with Segwit and their onchain scaling, they have a HUGE amount of transactional bandwidth--more than any other coin.  
Edit: As Bitcoin is impractical for sub 100 dollar transactions, I would expect LiteCoin to become quite popular.
