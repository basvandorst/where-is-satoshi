Wouldn't that require a fork off of Bitcoin?

Shouldn't a currency's value be determined by what *backs* it, not... the value of the precious resources which were completely destroyed just to create it? This is just horribly wasteful. I'm starting to lose faith my fellow memers.

I'd rather listen to a dozen doctors than a thousand first year med students.

Continuing my trend of being a worrywart, wouldn't quantum processing be able to also straight up break SHA256 and kill Bitcoin altogether? We're gonna need McAfeeBatteries.

Hmm good point but I imagine global Bitcoin use would require the big players (Google, Amazon, etc) to throw up huge data centers dedicated to upholding the blockchain and mining on a massive scale. That will probably become most of the world's mining. Replacing all that hardware every two years as we rapidly get more efficient would also be a massive cost that may rival the actual energy usage being saved. And if it doesn't save the big players any money, they aren't going to actually upgrade.

The amount of energy used on all that combined is no where near Bitcoin's possible consumption, which is why I'm bringing this up. I'm all for a global digital currency, but I'm starting to fear a more viable alternative may crop up within the next couple decades that is more efficient and consumes less resources.

If there's a conspiracy paying off every big name in the crypto community, I guess we already lost.

Very interesting! I read your article. The Digiconomist estimate does seem far fetched (which I hope is true) but even if the real numbers are only a 10th of what Digiconomist listed, that could still scale into consumption numbers that I personally just morally object to, especially with, as your article states, China doing most of the mining and most of their energy coming from coal. It seems funny to me, destroying a non-renewable energy resource to produce intangible internet money that could end up being just a fad. It's just such a... human thing to do.
Thanks for giving this topic some much needed attention :)

Pretending to be upset over this being called "Bcash" was the smartest marketing trick I've seen in a while.

send to a hardware wallet immediately, put it in a lockbox, turn all the lights off, and rock yourself to sleep in a corner
