Help me understand what I am reading. I sent a guy I work with 10 bucks worth to get him started into bitcoin.  He bought 300 shortly after. 
However, from my coinbase to his says the following...   "You have successfully sent 0.00059 BTC (worth $9.44 USD) to xx using Coinbase. To facilitate this transaction, you paid 0.00057392 BTC (worth $9.18 USD) in network fees"  
This is unreal! That's what I get to try and help get someone into Bitcoin. :(

I made a post about the fees of bitcoin and it never got a like.  Huff and fluff here man.

Great plan. I wish I had acted sooner. Went to my 2013 wallet and I never purchased. Lesson learned and bought in the recent 6500 dip. Upvote!

Question, I bought 1k USD after verifying my bank account. After purchasing, it said you will receive coins in 7 days (Next Friday). Why?

7 days? My bank said they haven't even tried to remove the funds yet.

Good luck to her! It's an awesome job!

Yep. I know enough to help someone. Its just a gesture to be nice. I am a nurse full time and was a career firefighter. It's ok for people to give a shit and want to help others.

Wow. All this mouth of how bad they are but give no insight on what to use instead. Maybe this is why people use them because people rather be all negative and not positive by telling him this information you know and walking out leaving him hanging with no alternative.

I posted offering help to a newbie and we should all mentor someone. It was removed as off topic. However, 5 eating testical posts made the front page of /bitcoin. Sad.

They're pretty slammed at the moment I'm sure. Growing faster than predicted.

So with my little farm, should I leave nicehash and head over to help support slush? I know its not BTC I'll be mining, but support the good guys has always been my thing.

Not here to steal. But that's fine. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:13:50
I purchased on Friday.

Oh well. I'm a cardiac Cath lab nurse. I just want to help others.  Sorry you think that!
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:35:16
So, which do you advise to purchase?
