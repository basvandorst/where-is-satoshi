Technically a bear trap is a buyer trap, not a seller trap. 
Hence, it happens when an asset appears to be overbought, not underbought.

And what if it falls woefully short of hitting that target by EOM? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:18:06
And what are you saying will happen in the alt coin space during that next run? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:15:56
Of course it does. For someone to take profit, that money has to either be there already or be pumped in. It is *exactly* a zero sum game in that sense. 
Now, it is not a zsg in the sense the value will keep rising as more fiat gets pumped in (and falling during flight back to fiat.) 
Unless I misread your comment and by "all resources" you are including externalities.

Got it. Where can you view the current future valuations for a given date?

Well they did commit fraud, didn't they? Insider trading, BCH pump, and all that…

That whole "hire a hitman" think was not a good look for him, or for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:27:29
The "early" dip? :-/

The whole rush to judgement thing is pretty scumbaggy, IYWMYO.

I don't seriously think it's going to zero, do you? 
But wow, parent poster you are replying to would seem to be contributing toward that outcome more than helping BTC growth and development. 
What I'm saying is just bc it attracts crazies and hotheads doesn't mean it will end badly, though it would be arguably be better off without them.

Why wouldn't that be a $500B market cap?

I don't think it's apophenia, though I appreciate your insight. 
I still believe it's an uncanny coincidence, but I'm not drawing any conclusions from it. And I haven't even bothered to look at the distributions of people named "Satoshi Nakamoto" geographically, though I imagine someone has. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:32:25


So it's just a far out coinkidink that Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto happened to live near Hal? 
It's just such an odd piece to the puzzle that keeps sticking out. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:29:04
This is really one of the most fascinating aspects. (Also, I believe it was *2* miles apart.) 
The thing that makes it seem like just a really uncanny coincidence, is how would Hal know that Dorian's name was really Satoshi, since he apparently didn't use that name anymore.

Not a transcript, but the co-host Ed changed his birthday on social media to April 5, 1975 which is pointed out is "Spartacus" gesture. Podcast goes on to talk about the idea of identity and how blockchain will be used for self-sovereignty.

You'd make a good bot.

I know the AMA is over, but the main question I have is why you couldn't accept the payout from the proceedings in the name of a predetermined non-profit beneficiary, that might benefit either the support the growth of healthy cryptocurrency economies, or a noteworthy (and non-controversial) charity of your choosing? 
Since the AMA is ended, perhaps others may have insight why that would not be a viable option here. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:36:02


Seems a surprising detail for a Szabo to have missed, IME, it's not too common. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:22:12


I wonder why then, smart contracts didn't figure more prominently in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 04:30:46
I don't know how to deep link to the timecode, but Satoshi/Spartacus starts right around ~25 seconds in: 
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:13:48
This sounds like a random guess. Do you not see the wall of buys around 6k or do you honestly believe the selloff at that point will overcome this support? 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:31:45
Yes, I see that now. That's pretty serious. Up until this point it seemed infantile fighting between BTC big money sellouts and BCH true believers in a main chain currency. (FD: I'm not on either side.) But Szabo weighing in about Ver/bitcoin.com should be clear sign to BCH community that they would be better off without him. (*as if that wasn't obvious before)
