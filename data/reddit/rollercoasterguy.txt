Hey folks,
I just made a basic page to follow bitcoin price in a proper roller-coaster-style. So for those few who randomly gave some ideais, I just said to myself: why not? I've had some free time and I had fun implementing in this all-about-FUDness stuff, so I hope you guys have some fun too and enjoy the ride! Tooo the mooon!!! ...Or not...

:^) dev here. I'm really really glad that you guys are enjoying the moon ride. That means my goal was achieved even if it's so simple. I'm very thankful for the support so I'll be adding more features to keep you up to date. To da moon!
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:27:10
Yeah, but it was automatic. The original gif is downwards, not my fault.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:11:27
That's for sure. I'm very excited about the technology. We are living a great revolution and I feel this year will be remarkable for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. But this is just for fun and market kinda represents the adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:11:14
I did not. I just made my point.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:47:31
(dev) I didn't embed in the header though. I'll look into that
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:50:10
i think you were already drunk to properly focus on it
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:17:52
aka: buy the dip sell the news
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:45:16
it's their Hodler Policy n.01, which says: Why panic sell when you can hodl!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:44

I just had an idea and executed it just for fun, making it *dynamic*. I had no intent to create anything revolutionary.

10K INCOMING !1!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:03:49
Got it. I think OP meant the roller coaster guy *site* (see the part: "copy-cat who give no credit") not the gif. But whatever, I don't claim myself the gif creator.
