Imagine this: (And stay with me here. I’m going somewhere with this story.)
You’re on a big boat with your girlfriend, enjoying a great day out on the water. You’re just finishing up a shower when you hear a loud ruckus coming from outside the bathroom. You go out to see some asshole trying to rape/murder your girlfriend. 
You attack, and now it’s a battle of you and your girlfriend vs the rapist/murderer. The battle spills out onto the deck of the boat and somehow your girlfriend and the rapist/murderer fall overboard. The rapist/murderer can’t swim well, so now he’s desperately trying to save himself by hanging onto your girlfriend, who’s a pretty good swimmer. She’s struggling now, however, because he’s flailing around and pulling her down with him. She struggles and fights frantically, kicking at him and trying to escape his murderous grasp. You toss out a flotation ring which she grabs, and you begin to pull her back up onto the boat, but the rapist/murderer keeps grabbing and clawing at her, trying to get back onto the boat too.
So here you are: Trying to get your girlfriend safely back onto the boat without also pulling in the rapist/murderer, who you know will only continue trying to harm you both if he manages to save himself. Your girlfriend is fighting valiantly to climb back up onto the boat while fighting off the desperate rapist/murderer, and trying to keep him from dragging her down or being able to re-board the boat with her.
Now let’s do some role-swapping. Imagine that the “you” in this story is you as a bitcoin investor. The “girlfriend” in the story is bitcoin, and the “rapist/murderer” in the story is bitcoin cash. I imagine this is pretty much what’s happening now. Bcash attacked bitcoin and caused both to fall overboard. Now bitcoin is trying to climb back up in value, with bcash trying to cling on desperately and pull itself up and save itself. If bcash is able to get back on the boat, you can be sure that the attacks will continue  until only one (either bitcoin or bcash) survives.

I don't know why the tax cuts need to be "paid for". Why can't the government simply cut its budget and make due with less, like they expect us to do when there are tax increases?
Besides, the democrats are already pointing out that the tax cuts are a scam and a fraud due to their being only temporary. As soon as the dems are back in power, the tax cuts are going away and everyone's taxes are going to rise, so they say that because of this, the tax cuts are a scam - it's not permanent.

I heard it explained like this:
Imagine that your unique 24-word seed phrase is a sugar cube (1cm square in size). Now imagine that you take all of the possible seed phrase sugar cubes and arrange them into a big sphere - a big ball of sugar cubes. 
If each possible combination had its own sugar cube, that sphere of sugar cubes would be so big that it would encompass the entirety of the Local Group galaxy cluster. (The Milky Way galaxy, of which our solar system is a part, is but one of more than 54 galaxies in the Local Group galaxy cluster. Our Local Group galaxy cluster spans over 10 million light years.)
Now, for reference, consider that the entire Star Trek series, with all of their travels, took place in just one small part of our Milky Way galaxy. 
Finally, try to imagine how long it would take you to find one particular sugar cube in a sugar cube sphere of that size.

There are fairly lightweight safes that bolt to the floor (bolts only accessible from *inside* the safe - so you need to open it if you want to move it).

Engrave your seed words onto a steel plate and then plasti-dip that so that words can't be read. Then put that into a safe deposit box.

No. The bank was robbed. The dollars were not robbed.

"...perfect world crypto should be distributed evenly in the beginning and have no central power."
I think that's what happened. Bitcoin is decentralized and in the beginning anyone who wanted to and was able to ("able" meaning they had a computer, an internet connection, and the mental ability to set up and run the mining software) could mine it and pretty much get all they wanted. I've seen posts where people who were solo mining back in the early days were getting blocks of 50 coins, day after day.

Yes. Obamacare was/is crumbling and is destined to fail. I suspect it was designed to fail so its failure would usher us into a single-payer (communistic) system. [All the better to control you with, my dear!]
I suspect that all this will be sorted by debate and votes. I hope no bloodshed is ever necessary. I don't think we, as a country, have been successfully divided to that degree yet and as things are, we're moving towards reunification.

Wrap the HDD in a cloth, then put that into a ziplock bag. Suck all the air out and seal the bag. Put it in the freezer for 24 hours. 
After 24 hours, take the HDD out and immediately connect it to your computer and see if you can access it while it's cold. 
This may sound crazy, but I did this with a portable HDD that I though was dead and I was able to access it to get my files off of it. This is a suggestion I got from a Dell technician. It worked for me, it may work for you. But even if it doesn't, you've lost nothing by trying.

I'm missing out too. I have a verified account with Coinbase and I have fiat in my bank account that I could use to buy bitcoin. 
The thing holding me back is that I no longer trust Coinbase. If I bought right now, it would take about 7 days before I would get control of my coin and be able to move it to my hardware wallet. 
After what happened with Bcash, I just don't have enough confidence in Coinbase to risk having them in charge of my funds for that amount of time.

Then Obama the Humble quietly arranged it so that the very day after Trump was elected, the economy started to grow and is now approaching 4% - more than double what Obama deemed "impossible".
For Obama to time it this way, so that it happens as soon as Trump is elected... to set it up so all this growth happens on Trump's watch instead of his own.... Man!!! That Obama is not only a genus but a saint!!!

"Everyone and their dog knows about bitcoin and is investing in it."
I've got two dogs. A chihuahua named "Nacho" and a Jack Russel named "Maggie". Both females.
Nacho bought 10 bitcoins at $240.00 and eventually talked Maggie into buying 5 at $320.00. They kept all 15 coins on the same hardware wallet.
About 6 months ago, my asshole cat Namira got hold of the dogs' seed phrase somehow. She raided their wallet of all 15 coins and blew it all on heavy whipping cream, salmon steaks, a green laser pointer, and a shit-load of cat nip. 
As you can imagine, the dogs were devastated at the loss and a bunch of family in-fighting ensued. Both dogs were yelping about how they "tried to get that asshole feline to buy in when they did, but she just kept calling it a 'bubble' and a 'ponzi scheme'". By the time we'd discovered what Namira had done, she had already gone through most of the heavy whipping cream and salmon steaks, but the dogs destroyed her laser pointer and scattered the remainder of her catnip around the yard in revenge. It was not a fun day.
Keep your seed phrases well hidden people! You don't need this kind of drama in your life!

Again we learn that when you buy bitcoin, STORE IT somewhere other than on-line. Not your keys, not your coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:35:14
Well, yeah. That's kind of the point of the free market. EVERY coin and every business is and should be under attack by the free market - that's how we grow and become stronger. 
Bitcoin faces these attacks head-on without flinching - we know that whatever doesn't kill us will make us stronger. 
If we lived in fear of the free market, we would try to hide from its attacks using deceptive tactics. We would be doing shady things like glomming on to the name of a more popular coin, scamming people by using website names that trick people into thinking we're affiliated with a more popular coin..... Those kinds of douchy things.

I heard it explained like this:
Imagine that your unique 24-word seed phrase is a physical object the size of a sugar cube (1cm square in size). Now imagine that you take all of the possible seed phrase sugar cubes and arrange them into a big sphere - a big ball of sugar cubes.
If each possible combination had its own sugar cube, that sphere of sugar cubes would be so big that it would encompass the entirety of the Local Group galaxy cluster. (The Milky Way galaxy, of which our solar system is a part, is but one of more than 54 galaxies in the Local Group galaxy cluster. Our Local Group galaxy cluster spans over 10 million light years.)
For reference, consider that the entire Star Trek series, with all of their travels, took place in just one small part of our Milky Way galaxy.
Now, try to imagine how long it would take you to find one particular sugar cube in a sugar cube sphere that is more than 10 million light years in diameter.

I think it's morally wrong and it's certainly unconstitutional to make a person prove that they *didn't* commit a crime when there's no evidence to the contrary, and to withhold their rights from them until they do so. Everyone deserves due process.

Don't fall for it! That's the secret of this dodgy little random number: It's random without *appearing* to be random. You see, it lulls you in with its false sense of non-randomness, and you just forget about everything else as you listen to its beautiful melody of non-randomness. Then...
It turns out to be random after all! Man! You didn't see that coming, did you? Just like when Lisa assured you that she and Doug were "just friends". Uh-huh... just friends my ass! She was banging him for three months before she gave you the old "I think we should just be friends" speech....

I don't see my post as bragging about returns. I simply stated a relevant fact. It wasn't a guess or an estimate. It was a mathematical fact. I also stated that my returns and principle could be wiped out at any time. That was not bragging or trying to make it look like I have "nerves of steel" either. It was also simply stating a relevant fact.

BTC has really gotten me to curb my spending. Now every time I think about buying something, I'll have a little voice in my head that says "no, you could put that money into BTC instead"!
Then the cashier snaps at me "c'mon buddy, do you want this 4-pack of Charmin or not? You're holding up the line!"
"No", I tell him, "I'm gonna just keep doing it middle-eastern style for now. I got a feeling we're coming up on a dip and I want to have the money ready to buy it up."

So, you can either activate a wallet and restore it's contents using the seed phrase from the last time it was activated, or you can activate it, have it generate a new seed phrase, and then you'll have an empty wallet ready for use. Got it. This puts my mind at ease.

You have to be extra cautious if you're driving on of these - that's for sure - but I don't think many people have been killed in them. There have been a lot of fender-benders around Slingshots (where the Slingshot is nearby, but not involved in the accident) because people turn to look at a them and stop paying attention to their driving. 
I always have to allot extra time at the gas station when I stop to fill up because it's inevitable that guys will come over to chat and check out the Slingshot.

Sorry to hear that this happened to you. .5 of a bitcoin is a hard hit to take.

I got banned too. Here's what I wrote:
"Pay off the CC, then look into investing in cryptocurrencies. I started with this 17 days ago. I bought some bitcoin, some ethereum, and some litecoin. As of today, my total investment is up 24.04%. In 17 days.
Just keep in mind that this is considered a risky investment. The chances that my investment could be wiped out tomorrow is NOT zero. So, DO NOT invest money that you cannot afford to lose. Also do your homework and make sure you understand well what you are doing. Know what cryptocurrencies are, get a basic understanding of how they work, know how and where to buy them safely, and how and where to store them safely. Do all this BEFORE you buy any."

That's the thing about the Slingshot - it seems to be very polarizing. People either love it or think it's uglier than a mud fence. Very few people will tell me that it's just so-so. I'm on the "pro" side for how it looks, obviously, but the best part is how much fun it is to drive. 
Another thing I've noticed is that kids absolutely LOVE the thing. I can't tell you how many times some kid has dragged his parents across the parking lot to come check it out. The look on their faces when I tell them to climb in and have their parents take some photos is always priceless.

I don't understand people who argue about "the value" of something. "Value" is a very subjective measurement. A thing's value will depend on who you're asking as well as the current circumstances that person is experiencing. 
For example, if you walk into a buffet restaurant, go up to a person with a giant mound of food on his plate, and try to sell him an orange for $3.00, he's probably not going to buy it. 
Now imagine you're on the 7th day of a 14 day trans-pacific cruise. On this cruise there is no fresh fruit because the delivery truck was in an accident and couldn't make the delivery before the ship set sail. Do you think your $3.00 orange might hold more value to the people on this ship than it did to the guy in the buffet restaurant?
When you say a bitcoin's value is $0, you're absolutely correct. *TO YOU* it is $0. But to a person who just bought a bitcoin for $8,000.00, the value is just slightly more than the $8,000.00 he just exchanged for it. While I can understand that you may try to change someone's mind by explaining why you think the value is more or less than they believe it to be, *YOU* don't get to determine the value of a thing for someone else. You can only decide what the thing is worth to you. So when two people are arguing over the price of a bitcoin, it confuses me because they are both subjectively correct about whatever they think it's value is. Now maybe one of those two will have more people who agree with them, but that doesn't mean that the other person is "wrong". 
Consider this: every time you purchase something, the exchange is, at its core, a disagreement between you and the seller. Let's say you go to Best Buy and purchase a drone for $400.00. What you are saying with your purchase is that you believe the drone is at least slightly more valuable than those 4 one hundred dollar bills you just gave Best Buy, otherwise you wouldn't have made the deal. Best Buy, on the other hand, disagrees with you and says that the 4 one hundred dollars bills are at least slightly more valuable than the drone. So you exchange the $400.00 for the drone and both of you feel like you have made a gain in value. You both come out ahead in the deal.
