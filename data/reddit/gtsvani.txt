why did you make them multisigs if you can unlock them with only one wallet?

I convinced my dad to buy 21 Bitcoins. He doesn't understand how it works but he likes the idea around it and the prospects. I think this is how it should be. You don't need to fully understand it to get involved!

Is this serious?
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:16:42
I'm going for it!!

I agree! Also it seems that it is not possible to write an article about bitcoin with out saying *In late November 2013 each bitcoin was briefly worth about $1,000 (£596) but the value collapsed soon after.*

I'm in the same boat as you. Just bought 20 BTC lets hope this works!!
@_date: 2014-05-18 22:08:59
I like Bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-05-19 00:08:51
How much BTC did you buy at the time with the $1000?
