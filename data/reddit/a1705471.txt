Legit, this dude getting mad at your negative comments towards him after instigating it with rude laughing at your expense. I begin to wonder if sfx is even here for crypto or if he just likes seeing his own weirdly spaced comments.

Whether you buy bitcoin at $250 and it goes to $50 or you buy it at $50,000 and it goes to $10,000 it doesn’t matter. You just lost 500%, so it’s now a better time to buy more.
Just buy it

Yes but your unsupported price predictions and unrelenting pessimism towards BTC makes conversation unsavoury.
I suppose you can say the same about the subreddit’s nihilistic optimism but you have to admit, having a positive outlook is makes things so much more rewarding.

woah dude, chill out. It's buying time not stressing time, just have some patience.Maybe hold on DCA'ing or investing more until you can get your normal obligations in order.
People who complain when BTC is down fundamentally do not understand.

Nice point my dude, but the maths says;
Probability of Heads occuring 100 time(s) = 0.5\^100= 7.8886090522101E-31
Therefore if you had 789,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 monkeys you would expect only one to flip heads 100 times in a row.
Taking the weight of a Mandrill Monkey, \~20kg the gross weight would be1.4\*10\^31 kg, which is 7.03% the mass of the sun

the only estimates we have is logarithmic regressions which fit the current model of growth.  
This does not account for future predictions, but has considered all days of recorded bitcoin price history (so it is the best long term regression we can create, but is in no means going to be future-accurate)

You should never invest more than you can handle. BTC might (it’s very unlikely) but may dip back to 3k just tomorrow. Can you handle that? Will your holiday be ruined if you don’t have this money?
If it’s yes to the latter question you should probably cash out ASAP next rise.
If the answer is no then hold on to your butts, this month looks like it may be one of the most profitable in all of bitcoin (only speculation, but it really do look that way)

Hey guys, bought in at 7918.90.  
Got another $300 ready to sink in when the price is appropriate but am waiting for another drop to like 7200.  
Is this appropriate or does the conglomerate think it'll sink more? I have seen the graphs but surely we wouldn't be expecting 5000 before 9000
