Jimmy, we will love to see Wikimedia Foundation accepting Bitcoin as one of donation payment methods. Please continue to discover Bitcoin, and consider adding it.
With regards,

I just instantly withdrawed 3.5 BTC from exchange. I confirmed withdraw by clicking e-mail, 30 seconds later transaction was in the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-23 10:09:56
Bitcoin payment option is still not on  I am not going to send them donation until they add Bitcoin there!
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:12:12
Is this project still alive? Webpage  seems to be down.

I can't view blockchain website via https, because:
Secure Connection Failed
An error occurred during a connection to blockchain.info. The OCSP response contains out-of-date information. (Error code: sec_error_ocsp_old_response)
    The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.
I am using Firefox and checking certificate validity deliberately.

I will only spend Bitcoins if I have profit from buying them. Right now Bitcoins are in downtrend so I will wait patiently. :)
@_date: 2014-11-23 10:11:12
I am not going to send them money until they add Bitcoin payment to their main Donate page 
Right now Bitcoin donation link is hidden and know only for those who clicked it from other page.

(just ironic) We all know, that BTCFPGA haven't finish them yet, so please stop this bullshit about shipping something what is not existing yet)

Only those three really matters. Don't bother to mine somethine else than LTC, BTC with NMC (as merged mining).
@_date: 2015-04-25 10:38:59
I never received any tip here. I would love to. Thanks!

Ripple Wiki is down.
'Sorry! This site is experiencing technical difficulties.
Try waiting a few minutes and reloading.

I am still mining with 1.3 MH/s scrypt ASIC miner which I got for free from another forum member and with 2x FPGA 1.15x boards each one producing 0.2GH/s which I sold over a year ago to my friend and now he gave them back to me for free so I am mining.
Yeah I will be rich man.

Bastards wanted to look fresh and modern that they accept Bitcoin. But really they didn't, just exploiting Bitcoin popularity (they got you as customer because of false sticker on the window).
Tell us their name and location.

It's just for USA? I am from UK and I would like to have it too, I am doing manually 10% of my wages right now.

Buying a node for one month is not really a longterm perspective. You should buy nodes for a year at least.
@_date: 2013-09-27 11:52:23
that's great that they supporting bitcoin donations. good luck.
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:02:23
Check this out:
 (sample address from list, not mine)
You can find your node on Bitnodes database, just type in your IP into address :)

I am running a full node for almost a year. Right now it's dedicated machine with bitcoind + p2pool running on it, AMD A10 APU processor and 16 GB DDR3 2400MHz fast memory. I will leave it running for another couple of years to support Bitcoin network. :)
