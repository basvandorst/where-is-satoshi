I'm not for taxes on purchases made over the internet, I haven't heard an argument yet that could convince me of it's necessity.

I understand this and don't refute it, I'm merely questioning to what extent will they tax individuals? The average tax payer pays taxes on their income, purchased good's and services, a gift tax etc. It just seems unreasonable to tax everything. I understand how taxes on income and purchased gasoline benefit taxpayers but taxes on everything seems somewhat unreasonable.

If I had Bitcoins to spend and something to buy, sure I would. There is such a thing as civil disobedience. When you break it down Bitcoins are just 1's &amp; 0's, I really don't see how they can justify outlawing it.

Nice UI, any chance it'll be cross-platform?
Edit: never-mind, I read your other comments.

I've come to realize that taxes on items and services must serve a purpose, taxes for taxes sake is ludicrous. Merely stating that someone has not paid taxes isn't enough for me to support state action against said person.

Yes, it's my understanding that they are just a website for sellers and buyers to conduct business.

I think in the interim both forms of commerce should exist as an experiment for a few decades longer to see how they thrive. Internet commerce is still young and levying taxes on something that hasn't matured could harm innovation.

What if the server cost is negligible to the owner and they use the bitcoins to buy other goods or services that accept bitcoins?

If you replaced the word Bitcoin with diamonds it sounds like this guy could have been describing De Beers.
