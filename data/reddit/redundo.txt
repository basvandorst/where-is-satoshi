Bitcoin is moving from low cost transfer vehicle to store of wealth and other coins, in particular litecoin, are becoming ideal for moving small amounts. When atomic swaps become possible in the next few months this process should become a lot easier.

Wtf has everyone on this sub gone numpty? She could sell a few hundred here and there to buy basic necessities like lambos and jets and the rest could be left to appreciate until she becomes the worlds first trillionaire

Yes, but technological advances are accelerating so if we continue as we are 1,000 years into the future could be akin to a million years of change at todays rate of change.
From the Wikipedia page  "An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the common-sense 'intuitive linear' view. So we won't experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century—it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's rate)."

This is not about going after Bitcoin Cash itself \(which would be impossible anyway\), only a website that is trying to sell Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin.

Have you used their merchant processing before?
I am thinking about incorporating into my website and I would like to know how well it works.

I've been tweeting to them on a daily basis to add litecoin. However now that that they are 'partners' with Jihan I fear this will fall on deaf ears.
