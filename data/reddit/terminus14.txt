Hey Omega watches are nice. Which one did you buy? I would love one one day although I can't remember which particular model I fell in love with last year.

Because a more educated population is a better population. Paying taxes is a good thing because you're paying to benefit the people around you, including yourself. Taxes help give us more educated people (that aren't crippled by debt), better infrastructure, healthier people, help for the financially unlucky, and tons of other things. I have no issue paying taxes because I know that they're the cost of living in society and helping improve that society.

Wish selling half my btc meant retirement for me. It'd mean I could afford a new pair of shoes though so that'd be nice I guess.

1 upvote = 1 pair of shoes

I'm not sure if they're non-profit (pretty sure they are) but I'd love to see some money go to the World Wildlife Fund.
The world is losing biodiversity every minute and while I don't have kids yet, I'm afraid when I do, they'll grow up without many of the amazing animals that I grew up loving.
I donate to them through Amazon smile. It's not much, but I do what I can. I'd love someone with more than pocket change to help them out. Pandas, tigers, polar bears, and even bees desperately need our help.

Hey very cool! I'm happy for you. I did some Googling and found that the one I wanted was the Speedmaster in black and yellow with the rubber band. Not sure if it has a specific name though.

Reddit requires you to hit enter twice to break a line. You did it right on your first two lines.
Here's your post, fixed.

How big of a crash do you suspect? Down to what price?

You don't need to buy a whole coin though. It's only as expensive as you want it to be.

There is a Lamborghini on there! Lamborghini has a bull as their emblem. There is a bull on the cake. I imagine it has multiple meanings. Bull market and Lamborghini.
