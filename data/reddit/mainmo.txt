So you didn't even read, cool.

Don't underestimate the 3 quarter period of building long positions on this support. If it breaks, the stops, liquidations, and short flips may create a massive movement. Howr low it goes is a thing to be seen. But I don't think we spend there long. I'm betting on a V-reversal.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:51:36
Fair. This was only there to emphasize my next point.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:12:47
The point of my post is not to convince you to trust anyone. I'm just saying that this has a potential to directly impact the price.
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:27:50
My best guess is it may be hard to buy large amounts instantly. Good question though.

DOGE is the real bcash.

Most likely. Keen to discuss?
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:00:48
Thanks for articulating my thoughts better than I could.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:32:56
Why would you be triggered if you weren't scared / in denial? Don't take the trouble to actually read the article (it's not about triangles) but feel compelled to spit anger?

As I said, some people just like being radical in everything they think is important.
@_date: 2018-09-29 10:04:10
Whoa, you realize this is impenetrable for your average "carnivore"? Or like, anyone? 
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:17:50
Trigger is the word you used, so you are. Also so tired that you had to apply so much effort to deny. Unbeatable logic.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:29:36
I think business acceptance will be lagging indicator, not leading. I'm sure Bitcoin is our best shot at transforming the world money but the road there will keep being rocky.
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:21:59
Just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's wrong. Your bias is clear.
@_date: 2018-09-30 21:19:50
Wow, downvoted like hell. Means we are still in denial...
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:20:12
Funny, I posted this a minute later: [
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:44:06
This is a valid individual position, but to "overhthrow" the existing system of bankers and governments, Bitcoin needs to blend into it. This will further legitimize Bitcoin, which is its priority 
On the other hand, I'm not done accumulating. ��
@_date: 2018-09-29 22:13:35
Perfect! Finally, it's like dollars and cents (bits and sats). Also 1 BTC = 1M bits. Kinda sets the goal straight.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:32:27
This is a financial product aimed at institutional money, based on the existing legal and financial infrastructure, to be backed by buying real Bitcoin. This is unlike other existing derivatives that are cash-settled.
Bakkt is scheduled to launch on November so I suggest that you watch it closely.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:09:54
I don't think it's good or bad. It's inevitable. Implications are unclear, as you said.
@_date: 2018-09-29 15:40:02
@_date: 2018-09-28 23:20:50
Absolutely! 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:26:11
I absolutely agree. There's a small chance that Bakkt may reverse the trend but I'm far from betting on it. Rather, it's going to add fuel to the next bull run.

Why did you have to do it? I wanted her to stay as elusive and inaccessible as those socks. No wonder Bitcoin will dump from here.
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:35:33
Most likely to shill some "next Bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:24:46
It only means they (those who answered the question) already bought and want everybody else to get back in. Doesn't mean shit.
Or they want to buy but can't justify the decision until it starts actually reversing.
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:30:27
Then you are not the target customer for this product. If you want keys, you can buy at plenty of places already.

Doesn't mean Gary will do. Trump's quote in the end of the article:

Because you don't pay capital gains. ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:39:20
Yeah, it's VERY difficult for an average crypto insider (me in the past included) to sit on their hands. We insist on losing money by overtrading.
The more you trade, the more you risk losing money. Then you trade more to make up for the loss and lose even more. Classic.
@_date: 2018-10-30 22:17:24
Even more reasons for Gary not to do it.
@_date: 2018-10-30 07:34:28
This is beautiful.
In PoS you can't unseat established gorillas (often founders). In PoW entities like Bitmain will keep rising and falling. Somebody else will always come up with better chips / more hashpower.
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:25:03
Mining empty blocks helps hide covert ASICBoost. Tx fees are low now so he doesn't lose much in money but can lose hashrate if small miners are not happy with Antpool games.
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:03:57
This could be because Coinbase is nothing in the legacy world, while Fidelity is a very big deal.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:55:56
Her is wrong about Bitcoin but he is 99% right about the crypto "industry".
If he wasn't THAT salty that he missed the run from $58 to $6400, he wouldn't sound like your aunt's loser ex, and would be taken more seriously.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:13:47
Thank you OP! We need more guerrilla marketing. You don't often come across a chance to do something both noble and funny.
@_date: 2018-10-24 20:30:48
There's no way they wouldn't have. A company knowing there will be demand at any price, would have been accumulating yearly bottoms.
At any price because instos would put 1% without looking to tell their customers they have exposure.

As long as scammers want to take dumb money, Bitcoin will have unlimited clones.

This is a very dull alternative.

Since we dropped like projected, the "now what" is showing its ugly head. If the market is not interested in these price levels, we are in for a further journey down.
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:35:27
In spite of being an important use case, Venezuela shows just how little Bitcoin is actually used. 1000 BTC being an alternative economy in a whole country is an early whale's fart.
We are still in the early days. Accumulate like crazy.

The month count doesn't have to be exact, just the movements. We are moving faster now but could be moving slower.

Too bad, whales need people like you to dump on. Permabulls and permabears should understand there are cycles everywhere.

I wonder why would anyone (in crypto at least) want a US citizenship. This one is the worst of police states and it will go after you anywhere in the world to get your crypto. Or get you in jail for it.
~~Proud~~ Lucky to have a third world banana republic passport and to live in Europe. Best setup imo.

Please show them the way to us all.

Yes, Venezuela is a perfect example of using Bitcoin as independent money that the government can't censor or debase. But as I said real usage like this so far is very small compared to speculation in the rest of the world.
@_date: 2018-11-11 18:41:34
If you have no special reason to have cash (cars and vacations are NOT one), don't sell anything. Next year will be the start of the most ridiculous Bitcoin run.
If you are fine on your own why sell at all? Hedge against central bankers who have no idea what they are doing and only know how to print self-inflicted problems out of sight while gladly sending everyone's savings to guillotine.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:49:59
They don't have to be identical, but they are eerily similar.
@_date: 2018-11-04 20:25:17
My point is Bitcoin is mostly used for speculation. Even more so for the rest of crypto. Would love to see real usage stats.
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:02:02
I see what you did here but my point is it DOES matter at what price you buy. But you can't know the exact bottom, of course.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:58:13
Then don't also tattoo your passphrase at least.

So the first guy mined 50 BTC every 10 minutes on his PC. Everybody thought he was nuts. The second guy bought some at $0.003. He liked it. Third guy bought a lot at $2. People started rushing in at $250. The last were celebrating they could buy under $10,000,000.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:00:33
That's why it doesn't belong in crypto and Reddit.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:37:32
I don't agree, the difference would be having 2.5x bitcoins. Money is made on entry, retained on exit.

3 days after your comment: $2K lower.

Yes, Bitcoin is aiming to replace state money -- a noble and ambitious goal.
BNB is good in the sense that even if it's not necessary, they make it useful and appreciating. I think tokens that survive the eventual "flight to quality" will be like BNB -- a defendable, rewarding way to use actual, working products.

Tell them precisely that you are investing for a better life. What you described is very mature for a kid, not many adult people do it. They could actually encourage you.
Otherwise you let their imagination run wild, as something is clearly going on. You either let them think that you do drugs or that you take care about your own future. What do you think they will like more?
I'd be proud to have a son like you.
