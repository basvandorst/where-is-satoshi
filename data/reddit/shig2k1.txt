Typical of US government. Never bothered investigating and prosecuting Wall Street criminals - but they were all over FIFA like flies around shit.
This will be another big witch-hunt distraction, while corruption spreads through the White House like cancer

I think that some of the more zealous bitcoiners like to follow conspiracies all the way down to the bottom of The Internet rabbithole... That usually leads to interesting stories about the Rothschild family... etc.
I guess it's so hard to find concrete facts that people are willing to believe even the most absurd stories - probably why the flat earth community has drawn so much attention recently - almost like they're competing to believe the most ludicrous things.
True anti-semitism is despicable though... same as any other baseless hatred of a race or followers of a belief system.

Criticism of Israel's behaviour isn't anti semitic.
It's horrible what's going on over there. Israel doesn't deserve to have it's neighbouring countries calling for its destruction - but similarly, the treatment of the Palestinian people has been barbaric. Neither side is blameless in this conflict.
... Appreciate that my comment is completely unrelated to the thread. Just felt like chiming in :-/

If you find yourself watching the price go up and down and thinking "If I'd just bought then... If I'd just sold then..." Just remember the immortal words of my late uncle Billy. 
"If I had a square arse, I could shit enough bricks to build myself a house"

I've found that frequently playing guitar and very occasionally dropping pychadelics resets my brain enough to handle the vox populi - I can't help getting angry when tweets are reported as news; but I think that's an unavoidable consequence of getting older

I don't believe that we won't see investment and advances in clean energy, driven by the requirements of the crypto mining industry... And as banks see efficiencies in their own system, their energy usage will decrease.
Always with the doom and gloom from the media. No wonder everybody's so fucking unhappy all the time

Yes. The UK where citizens have no right to bear arms or to defend their property, but the gov't are happy to allow arms exports to Saudi Arabia etc. The UK which has engaged in pre-emptive strikes, destabilisation of foreign governments, and colonialism - and brands everyone else as terrorists. The UK which for years pointed at the Chinese firewall and screamed "censorship" - but desperately wants the same control over the Internet. The UK which wrings its hands about the gangs selling drugs and the dangers of legal highs - but refuses to engage in sensible discussion on drug reform policy. 
The UK is undemocratic and backward. Its citizens are slaves to a corrupt financial market and a government which refuses to listen. Until that changes, terrorism is the least of its problems

This is the shit people see when they open Apple News. The public perception of Bitcoin will be distorted for a long time by this kind of misinformation. I sent them a message to inquire whether they actually mean that Bitcoin is the perpetrator

Bitcoin has nothing to do with the exchange of such materials, it's simply the method of payment. You might as well blame mastercard when someone goes postal with an ar-15 they bought on credit

And this was my initial point. We must all understand that headlines are clickbait and news is a construct designed to sell the reader's attention to whomever is paying the publisher. In this case, the reader is being shown information which reflects BTC as a positive thing - ie a transparent network where the proceeds of crime are more traceable than pallets of dollars... But frames the article in such a way as to fool the the reader into thinking that BTC is somehow to blame for the networks existence

JP Morgan is using the same maths as the police do when they seize drugs with a street value of "x"; where x is the amount they found, divided into the smallest possible unit and multiplied by the highest possible cost.  As others have pointed out, they are not taking efficiencies into account.

Whether in Moscow or Whitehall, they're all spending the proceeds of a corrupt system. Just some are called up to explain where it came from and others carry on with impunity.

Yeah I get it. Maybe she's spending the proceeds of crime... But since theft is only theft if the government isn't doing it - I anticipate a financial witch-hunt from the UK gov in order to shake any untaxed coins from the public's pockets. Who wants to bet that old money is excluded from this order? I bet the queen couldn't explain how she got most of her wealth :-p

Craig Wright is like that Billy Bullshitter kid at school who would tell you all about his rich uncle the footballer.  How he was going to buy him all these awesome toys... Which never appear, because obviously, the uncle doesn't exist. Even when you think he can't embellish it further and dig himself deeper into the lie, he comes out with another whopper. Any ordinary person would have tried to get out of the spotlight after the whole "I am Satoshi" news story. Even his mum effectively said he's full of shit.
Craig. Give up mate.

People borrowing more than they can afford to pay back and then defaulting on securitised loans doesn't help either. I worry that there are too many people using borrowed money to buy crypto -  if they're unable to repay those loans en masse, everyone gets screwed over
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:42:58
I hold crypto dude. I'm just suggesting that the last financial crisis was caused in part by people defaulting on loans they never should have taken out in the first place
