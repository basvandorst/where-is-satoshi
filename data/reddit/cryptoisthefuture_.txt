I don't think there's anywhere they could even do a market sell for 1 million BCH that's crazy

Imagine if Bitfinex and Binance were hacked with a significant portion of this Bitcoin on it. Article says that $100 million worth of bitcoin has been transferred to those exchanges.  
Can't believe that much BTC is just chilling on those exchanges, can anyone tell if/how much of the $100 million has been liquidated?

Just used it last night, only cost me 20k bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-04 00:06:42
In that order

To be fair there are 2 possibilities for a drop in BTC hashrate:
1) Fewer miners online contributing power to the network
2)  As you said, an exhaustion of the world's energy supply 
The likelihood of  occurring is infinitely greater than  but  is theoertically possibility.

This is great. Keep doing what you're doing!

Anyone who makes a comment like this is a piece of shit

You can't make a claim about something being overvalued, then circle back and say "in my opinion, it's overvalued" LOL
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:17:27
That is awesome.
@_date: 2018-11-17 23:34:09
Sure but that just involves talking to my partners and deciding at what point we want to cut down on hash rate. Doesn't take as long as you might think.
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:21:05
It takes time to deploy / switch off significant hashrate. 
From someone who owns a mid-level mining farm, it takes 2 seconds to switch off.

How far up your ass did you pull these numbers out?
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:47:53
5 of my friends and i have all paid our mortgages in bitcoin ur so dumb LOLOLOL
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:41:58
Made $?
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:59:41
Well then you're kinda a dumbass for ignorantly assuming something. Feel bad your 20 employees work for a dumbass.

There's a video of Ver supporting Bitcoin from this year?
@_date: 2018-03-24 03:34:17
That's awesome bro, spread the knowledge and more importantly ENJOY!!!
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:25:06
That's awesome man, wish you the best. Do you have to mine a block to make money or do you dedicate your hashpower to a pool?
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:09:17
Lmao this is great! Back when Ver believed Bitcoin was the real Bitcoin. Sad to see what he's turned into with his new found wealth though...BCASH BCASH BCASH!!!
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:00:07
For your 20 employees that won't accept bitcoin as payment
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:03:22
No, speculation is also an answer.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:00:49
***You*** are entirely wrong. The mere existence of BCASH takes value away from BTC. Hashpower, brainwashed users, developers, etc. 
Pointing out how Roger Ver, the biggest and most influential BCASH cheerleader, is batshit crazy is not irrelevant to the BTC subreddit.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:53:23
Ah gotcha. My point was that Ver doesn't believe Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin anymore, that he thinks it's "Bitcoin Core". Now Ver thinks BCASH is the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:18:39
HAHAHA THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF EVIDENCE HE DID IT. 
STOP TALKING OUT OF YOUR ASS!!!
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:08:48
You should not tell people what to follow. Many people are in it for the money, so that's what they follow. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:31:43
hey i downvoted you cuz u like BCASH lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:30:52
but it's in his title lol
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:31:58
Hahaha you're so right. OP retarded.
@_date: 2018-04-05 02:33:41
Bullshit you guys don't accept fidget coin.
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:59:57
The med deli one is out of service indefinitely, has been for the past few months :(
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:01:28
100. 
And we get downvoted lol, I guess that's what we get for thinking critically.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:55:17
I love you &lt;3
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:53:54
