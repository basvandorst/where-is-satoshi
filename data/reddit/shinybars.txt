We do a lot of transactions through PayPal (10's of thousands a month). In regards to black listing. We added "Silver Bullet Bullion" to our inventory and promptly received a nastygram from PayPal telling us to remove the "Bullets" from our site. My response was simply "What?" with a pause, then "Ok, give me 30 seconds and i'll promptly remove PayPal from the website." After stating that, they starting questioning more and I had to send them to the manufacturers website so that they would understand that the products weren't actually bullets. With all that said, accepting PayPal as one of our payment methods actually works out quite well, but Bitcoin is 100% our preferred method!

We limit the transaction size and have strict risk controls including shipping only to the cards billing address. If we have any concerns, we call and discuss the transaction with the purchaser. If it doesn't seem right, we cancel the order. Overall though, we simply cannot compete without accepting cards. On the other hand though, accepting bitcoins is quickly changing that. If growth continues as such and the bitcoin world remains merchant/consumer friendly, we just might scrap credit card orders all together! We will see!

We have a couple of 1oz gold eagles and a pile of 2014 silver eagles on the way! The gold eagles are ready for you to lock in the low prices!

The benefits you mentioned are exactly why so many online merchants, including ourselves, have begun accepting payment in bitcoins. Our bitcoin sales have actually surpassed all other payment methods we offer! With that said, companies such as bitpay (our provider) make it quite simple to be up and running with accepting bitcoins! I'm to the point where I prefer bitcoin orders over any others because of the issues relating to CC's and checks. Bitcoin is fantastic! Bitpay alone services over 20,000 merchants according to their website.

Unfortunately ShinyBars isn't shipping to Australia yet. Keep an eye on the site though please as we are actively working to expand into markets beyond the U.S. With that said, it is a dream of mine personally to visit Australia!

As a supporter of bitcoin (and other crypto coins for that matter) we support your cause to help Dorian. It is truly amazing to us the lack of respect Newsweak has dumped on Dorian and feel that his life will be damaged in the near term. The Man deserves respect and support from the bitcoin community! 0.0268 (All BTC we currently have in our wallet) is on its way to support the cause!
Thanks for doing this!

Interesting article/list with some big ticket items! You can also buy Gold &amp; Silver with bitcoins...but i'm sure you all know this already! According to BitPay alone, they have over 20,000 merchants using their services. ;-) [ShinyBars.com](

We have a pile of silver and a little bit of gold on the way  available for price lock! These will be shipping in 1-3 weeks (probably closer to one but we throw the 3 on just to be safe). We added 1oz gold eagles to our inventory recently and the bitcoin community wiped those out in 2 days. Thanks!

As of today, bitcoin sales have far surpassed all other payment methods that we offer! You all rock! Thanks!

We hold a significant percentage of orders paid with bitcoins. The percentage varies depending on the market. The way we look at it is "why accept it if you are not going to take part in and support the revolution?" It is certainly not ideal for us to hold all of the bitcoins that we receive because of supplier side lack of acceptance at this time. If the supplier side comes on board, we will increase the percentage significantly. [ShinyBars.com](

@_date: 2014-02-04 20:47:07
Will do! Looking for 1oz bars?
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:09:11
Congrats! Over 50% of our sales now come from the BTC community!

It's on! :-) We have huge respect for you all though! Also, we would love to be in CO as that's where my family is located. Want a VIP tour of the Coors plant? I can make that happen!

We have added near real-time bitcoin pricing to our product pages. We are working on integrating further to provide a bitcoin total at the shopping cart. Now you only have to break out the calculator once...to get your total before final checkout. Obviously we want to make it easy as possible, so keep checking back while we work on full integration! We have processed MANY bitcoin orders already without issue.

[ShinyBars.com]( offers cash discount pricing for gold and silver orders paid with Bitcoin (or other Crypto). So it is 4% cheaper to use BTC as compared to credit cards! We have been accepting crypto's since January of 2014.
We will pay a visit to your site and shoot you an email. Thanks!
