Not necessarily. If the person in charge of this was smart and rich enough to afford proper marketing.. you’d be surprised how ignorant people can be. I can see a dozen ways to market such a product that will prey on such ignorance, with a dozen “backdoor” methods to track the sale/use of the coins internally. Then they can just say their the only ones that have access to the data, change a policy or two a month later and they end up selling every bit of your information.
I just wouldnt trust this sort of product. It would take a lot to trust the manufacturer of anything crypto related thats similar to this..

If your entering the bitcoin market right now your crazy. Good luck though.

Im gonna say this lightly but I have serious doubts about bitcoin holding its gains past new years. All these people working overtime for the holidays and some big shady players in the market taking advantage of the ones that arent selling. I just dont see people being as crazy about it when its 20 grand 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:31:45
Im sorry but thats the thing with BTC.. Theres no fucking way Id sell a car for BTC at the price its at right now. Hell fucking no.. Its over priced. Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:46:18
Can you elaborate? 
Monetary incentive? Narratives? Currency vs store of value? 
What are you saying
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:24:48
You guys are a hoot.. shits overpriced. Idc if its 100 grand next month or in a year, shit will be even more overpriced. Its easy for you to say the things you are when your sitting nice and cozy with a potential few million in profits already realized, but any wishing to enter this market at this point in time is an ignorant nut case.

I agree.. A lot of money will be walking out the door and not ever coming back when it inevitably “crashes” or dips. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:19:52
Im just saying I feel like that car (or just any car really) is worth more. Id definitely feel comfortable selling it for a *few* BTC but less than one?? No way..

We’re still relying on said entrepreneur to have morals and not implement any means whatsoever to track the cards. While your idea is fascinating, and yes possible, its very fragile and unlikely.

Funny how Bitcoin has made a complete 180 degree turn here. Initially, it was marketed as secure and private. Now that nobody can argue that it in fact isn’t, its being marketed more honestly here.
I honestly prefer FIAT when I dont want my purchases to be traced. And thats a lot of the time. I realize the vast majority of data collection is harmless and used simply for ad-targeting (which Im okay with..) but we are relying on humans to have morals here and not use that data to harm me in the future. Historically, when money is in the picture all human morals go out the window. I’ll stick to using FIAT for the vast majority of my purchases.

How much does this effect the price of BTC? Or is it dependant on how it actually effects it? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:33:39
I disagree with this. The only reason Id ever spend BTC online is because coins like LTC aren't accepted. LTC miner fee's = a few CENTS and the transaction goes onto the blockchain in 10~ minutes. BTC miner fees = a few dollars and take 15-45 minutes (or days if you decide to pay less in fees, literally could be days). 
Idk why anyone would tell someone to spend BTC. Honestly, Just pay with VISA until BTC either gets cheaper and faster or other cheaper and faster coins start becoming accepted. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:59:37
The thing is coins like LTC and VTC ALREADY HAVE LIGHTNING. And segwit was implemented on those WEEKS if not months ago.. Smh but you shills just want your million dollar bitcoin so you can dump and get the hell out. BTC should be being abandoned. I believe to some degree, once LTC has full scale lightning network, people will begin to wake up. BTC will still hold a large amount of its value but will not inflate to near the prices some are predicting right now.
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:38:51
You pretty much dont ever want to "spend" with BTC. You just want to hold it like gold. Spending BTC at this point is like taking your fathers 50 year old coin collection to buy cigarettes. And paying an additional 5$ just to use those coins, and waiting 20 minutes for the payment to actually go through.
Invest in BTC, find some other coin to spend with.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:17:39
No. BTC has a big role on many exchanges. Its a real PITA because most exchanges force you to go through several layers of verification before you can trade with fiat. But its as simple as signing up on most to start trading with BTC. BTC is therefore basically the key to buying the majority of your altcoins. But to me, buying altcoins is basically the only use it has.. I think that use is one of the few things actually driving its demand. Its certainly not being used as a daily currency given the fees.. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:51:43
I suppose BTC is safer to some degree if your paying to a merchant you dont trust (I admit I did pay 5$ in fees to purchase a 10$ item off of G2A the other day just to avoid submitting my visa CC to the site). 
So there is that, but I have no issues giving my visa over to sites like amazon etc. Not that they accept BTC right now anyways. 
And Im sure its just a bug but your link in response to the miner fees isnt pulling anything up. Irregardless of your link... whatever it may be... those days are not over. Saying as just yesterday I paid 5$ in fees for a 10$ product off of g2a and it took over 25 minutes.

Stop focusing on price? Lol shit must be going terrible for yal thoughts and prayers
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:50:45
Its also flat
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:32:17
Yea, theres also NASA in Texas. And Im pretty sure SpaceX launches (and lands) most of their rockets out of Florida which is just a few states away from me. shit, I actually kinda feel bad for europeans now that Im thinking about it theres a lot I take for granted here in America.
edit: Switzerland though.. do you guys get any kind of view on the northern lights up there? If so, thats definitely something to look into. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:10:33
why would you need to know this? seriously why the fuck would you need to know?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:26:22
Tbh I cant think of anything off the top of my head, most definitely this feeling is probably a result of my own selective bias. Theres lots of cool things in North America one thing that actually comes to mind is the new circuit of America built in Austin texas in 2015. Im pretty sure europe has a dozen more circuits than America though, afaik the one in Austin is the only one in America that holds grand prix such as the MotoGp. 
edit: well speaking of circuits, if you’re in europe you definitely live closer to the isle of mans than me. Thats definitely something lol
edit2: Also, is top fuel drag racing a thing in Europe?? If not, thats definitely something you’re missing out on. Its amazing
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:12:47
Huh. As an American, I got way too excited when I read mexico. Usually all the cool shit like this is found in Europe or some other far as fuck place like New Zealand. This is actually in the realm of possible for me
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:09:12
ya right, r/youseeingthisshit its obvious shill post
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:24:39


The fact bitcoin still has a larger marketcap than litecoin is evidence this is not true.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:22:00
Is “insider trading”, as far as btc goes (not including ETFs or BTC backed stocks/regulated instruments) even illegal tho? I dont see how it could be. As atleast the US government has no jurisdiction over Bitcoin. Why do you want the government to have jurisdiction over such things? Surely the negative will outweigh the positive.. Even if it doesn’t immediately, it WILL get worse and worse in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:34:09


Why wont people just hold their OWN private keys and coins and problem solved?! Class action lawsuit is literally asking for government regulation. Just ASKING for it. FUCK THAT.
