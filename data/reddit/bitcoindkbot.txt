That is not the worst part. 
They sacrificed the nodes for a little more on-chain transaction that none use. 
They blocked segwit, a solution to scale bitcoin horizontally. 
But I don't care. If you want something that has vertical scaling then the answer is BCH for everyone else there is BTC.

If you asked me... the real power is the power to bootstrap the network. some altcoins have very few nodes and can be shutdown easily - looking at top 10 altcoins.. many of them aren't really decentralized.

@_date: 2018-08-16 12:44:34
Why? Most of the nodes are hosted on two different cloud services.  If you ask a bcasher if they run nodes they say obviously no. Bcash is not competing with bitcoin anymore...  and haven't really done it since the 32MB fork, at 32 all small nodes will be gone in two years. 
Bcash is going the route of a few large nodes. It is not bitcoin it is something else. I just look at it as private money, and by private i mean that there is a single issuer just like banks in the olden days.
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:01:05
You might as well pick litecoin or dogecoin. rogercoin is not really an alternative because the idea is to scale vertical - meaning having a few large nodes. that is not the bitcoin I wanted. There are more LN nodes than rogernodes, and if you remove the two cloud hosting provides it is probably worse than dogecoin.
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:59:52
You can't go from zero knowledge to EOS... 
EOS is currently only for experts... I mean there isn't even a wallet yet? and the tokens needs to be registered with a smart-contract..

Windmill V162(lets assume 5.6 MW) - $14.918.025,45
Bit Main New Antminer S9I \~ 13.5TH/S @ .097 W/GH - 1310W €856.00 - $953,93
5600000/1310 = 4274.8 miners per windmill costing $4.073.122
So two large windmills 
2\*4274\*13.5TH = 115398TH
Return On Investment (ROI) in Days**: 3,317.6 days**  






In \~ten years.
 3,317.6\*2.2(at current hashrate(lul..)) = **7298.72 bitcoins.**
Or Buy on OTC($7969)  = **6,277 bitcoins**

I’m sorry, I know those two words are not enough to make this better or  win you back.  That’s not why I’m writing this.  I want to tell you that  I now see how much I hurt you and how wrong I was.  
I let my ego get the better of me and I see how that was the worst possible thing I could have done.  
Do you remember when Gavin looked at your signature that was a fun day. That’s when I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that I wanted you in my life.  
I can only hope that for all of these reasons you will feel that our  relationship is worth saving. Please know that I get it now.  When I  shut my eyes and imagine how I would feel in your shoes, I completely  understand your reaction.  It is a big deal and my heart is breaking  just thinking about it and I just can’t believe how much pain I’ve  caused you.  
I love you so very much Craig , and I understand that I will have to live with your decision. Please come back to me.

But why o why did CSW post it? for everyone to see? is he retarded or is he extremely good at convincing us that he is not satoshi? What would satoshi do?

#       “The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the  one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was  probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery  was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was  their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant.  Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and  write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of  memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made their living simply by  selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do  with the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he  was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were  largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners  of the big prizes being nonexistent persons.”

Even if you made it complex... 
and read this


It doesn't matter how you do it. Hardware is coming.
But we are lucky that we can buy miners that are ~7nm.. it doesn't get any better and you just have to pay for electricity.  
Bitcoin is simply proof of spend electricity. just like Gold is proof of spend digging. Fiat is proof of violence.
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:23:30
ASICs are necessarily more cost effective because they use less power per hash than CPU/GPU/etc
If you look into how much hashing power it takes to cheat the others miners it is rather low. 
So if the block takes longer to verify then you have an even bigger advantage for finding the next block.
@_date: 2018-07-08 16:13:09
A problem like the traveling salesman(NP) can't be verified very quickly, and for good reasons. 
PoW is limited to a special(hard to find - easy to verify) set of proofs.
BTW - I have been having the same thoughts as you..  I have even writing pseudocode for a CPU friendly/GPU unfriendly PoW - a modified cunningham chains finder/proof...  eventually there will also be writing GPU/ASICS miners for this.. so I haven't done anything with it.

OK it can be done!... you can make some proof that requires a lot of memory... 
But then you only made the inevitable ASICs more expensive. 
There is no reason to talk about CPU mining - it cannot be done.

It will never be more cost-efficient to use a normal CPU.
The only time it would make sense to use a CPU is if you do something like gridcoin, but when you think about it...  it is dangerous to use PoW to do anything but to proof that you burned the electricity.  
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:24:44
1. Doing ASICs once again... and you risk someone mining the remaining 4 million coins.. 
2. There is no problem/proof that cannot be solved ASICS given a good enough reward..
What problem can you solve on a CPU where you can't do it faster with a GPU? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:06:00

Please tell what PoW that would work better on CPU? 
CPU is not even a category
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:56:51
Cost effective: 
Lets assume there is a need for doing censorship-free transactions on the internet and a store of value without the risk of confiscation. And the tokens/coins are released every 10 minutes - if too few people mined the hashrate would drop... then I'm sure both you and I would start mining them - but we don't because our electricity is probably too expensive.
Bitcoin is only cost effective to the individual and not to a large group.


I have no idea...well I guess 10% of the computation would be max... 
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:40:40
It doesn't matter what algo we change to... there will always be produced ASICS... if you change the algo at a short interval then we centralize it even faster! because only the fastest ASICs manufactures will do the mining. We are lucky that satoshi picked up SHA-256

I run my own special compiled version with UASF 148 and other non-standard parameters so, there it that.. 
What node are you running?

How many full ETH nodes will there be?  
In bitcoinland there are 30000+/7300 full nodes. 
If the nodes require terabytes fewer will run them and thereby make it centralized, you might as well just run your "code" on your own server.

How about 2024?

I would probably do a 2 sat/B 
So yes

I had the same thought... 
It could be triggered by  WW3 or solarflares.. 
In this scenario - we could hardfork... but the world would be in a dire state before jumping to the *easy* block. You might as well be stocking up on iodine.

Why not crowdfund everything?
If people want it they will buy it.

With a capital D. 
There is no tax when spending your coins in Denmark! Only if you buy fiat.
Yes! white people are welcome except those bastards from sweden.

It was a double cross...

If you have your own keys. Then you will have coins on both chains. 
Don't worry! You don't have to do anything.

Don't worry. 
The only thing Bitcoin needs to do is to keep on going! all fiats fail eventually! The average lifespan for fiat is 23 years. 
Even during this suppose crash from $20k, bitcoin is still better than the shitfiat of shitcountries. 
If you have any doubt look into the price vs halving.

First they came for the right-wingers, and I did not speak out—because I was not a right-winger.
Then they came for the shitcoin traders, and I did not speak out— because I was not a shitcoin trader.
Then they came for the bitcoiners, and I did not speak out—because I was a nocoiner.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
