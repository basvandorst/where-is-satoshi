Well, if you look at the q ratio you'll see that the S&amp;P isn't overinflated now by abundant money floating around thus based on real company value. This rise in value correlates to and is based on economic growth and increase of the GDP. This growth will continue in the forseable future (wars and trump fuckups/catastrophies aside).

"Approximately 10% is the average return for the S&amp;P 500 since its inception back in 1928.  Adjusted for inflation the "real return" is more like 7%.  Also worth noting that nearly half of the gains from the S&amp;P 500 resulted from dividends."
Get your facts straight dude..
