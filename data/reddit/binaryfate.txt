Just some clarification here: the "potential pool" is about inputs, not outputs. The outputs (recipients) are cryptographically unknown and not just obfuscated, by a mechanism very similar to Bitcoin's stealth addresses.   
   


   
Huh? It sounds exactly like "they could go to the Bitcoin CEO and ask the private keys". Only you know your view keys, nobody else. (it's very similar to a Bitcoin private key except it's used to view stuff, there's yet another one to spend; so you're in full control of it).

@_date: 2015-06-04 14:58:14
Monero is so tiny compared to Bitcoin that I don't think what you mention is making any significant difference at this stage... (admittedly with zero analysis too) :)
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:47:36
You can see it on any block explorer, for instance:    
Many services such as exchanges didn't bother to use ring signatures. There is also the issue of "dust" that makes it possibly difficult to mix under certain conditions; it's being worked on, you can learn more about that in Section 2.1 here: 
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:24:22
This is the same formula used in Monero (except Monero is using the median and not the average).   
It's disconcerting to see this sudden hype for such an adaptive scheme while it has been out there and running fine on the Monero protocole for more than a year.   
For more details see Section 6.2.2:

Unless you keep a complete separation between your identities/funds, you'll have links between your different addresses.   
Look at the number of startups being created to analyze coins "taints" (correlations between addresses, possible sets belonging to entities, matching with real-world or online identities, etc.). The fact that it seems a viable business model to them should tell you a lot.
@_date: 2015-12-15 19:12:34
The word "mixing" in the case of Monero is misleading: it suggests people are actively doing something when you want to mix with them ("a la Dash"). The concept is very different though and completely passive, take the time to understand, it's elegant.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:30:14


   
This is ethically uncorrect and would not be acceptable in an academic environment. The similarities have been mentioned to you early after you wrote that bitcointalk post and from there on played a role in shaping the development of discussions.   
But most important, you cannot prove that you did not know about it.
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:55:18
You're likely "rinse" your bitcoins with others that are maybe traceable with bad (or worse than yours) activities.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:43:07


   
If you have sufficient disk space (with SD cards happily holding the Bitcoin blockchain already, IMO we're there for good), the remaining assumption at play for a "no UTXO set" system such as Monero: can we rely fully on disk access (and not RAM access) so that we can verify transactions quickly enough? With SSD access time being one or two orders of magnitudes better than HD one, it seems likely to me to be well feasible, providing you have an efficient DB to organize data. This wouldn't hold for all coffee-cup transactions, but Bitcoin wouldn't either, currently. ;)   
   
Side remark about implementation: cannot the concept of UTXO that is so central in Bitcoin be seen ironically as a double edge sword, since the core code is very strongly based on efficiently accessing this datastructure? The drawback being we have a major impact of any other use of the blockchain - even not malicious - that is "bloating" the UTXO set. (Notary activity for instance - the fact that you can do it in a provably unspendable way doesn't mean people always necessary do, providing there is no significant cost to do it the dumb way by bloating the UTXO set).   
   


   
The Monero research report [here]( suggests that rings of size 4 might be sufficient (combinatorial explosion kicks in quickly, and for once it is welcome...). More research should be done in that direction, but what it shows is pretty encouraging so far.   
You're right the blockchain would be larger than ~4.5x if people had use less often zero-mixin, maybe twice as much or so; however you rightfully point out that it could be mitigated with a better implementation. Your paper referred to in the OP is an awesome news in that direction. Congratulations for that work by the way! :)   
   


   
Do you agree that increased privacy/fungibility necessarily comes by trading off some performance against Bitcoin (as we know it today)? Or do you think it's realistic/feasible to get it at no performance cost? I believe the former, and as long as the "performance degradation" is acceptable given available technology, then it will be interesting to some people (not necessarily all or all applications).   
   


   
I think many not-so-technically inclined Bitcoin users have a wrong view of what their privacy are. The "enlightment" is coming slowly, fungibility being publicly attacked more and more often and even making headlines. We're a long way now from people buying weed without any special measure from their daily wallet, shouting how private and untraceable their activities are, and how cool it is...   
At least there, with people already into Bitcoin and cryptos, you have a pool of people who would be willing to use privacy tools at some possible expenses, because privacy is one of the thing that dragged them into Bitcoin originally, and they come to realize they overestimated that privacy.
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:04:39
Who cares?
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:34:21
I don't have the skills to judge the crypto. At least for the implementation, yes we're probably far off having a library implementing this that is sufficiently reviewed to trust mainnet money on it.   
   
The "bloat" is an often raised, false issue IMO. If you look at Monero for instance, it already gives us 1 year of practical feedback: the blockchain is ~4.5x larger than the Bitcoin one, for the same level of activity. (Basically you're trading off additional space requirement for increased privacy/fungibility).   
This is a *constant* overhead on the blockchain growth, so both Bitcoin and Monero (or any ring-sig chain) are in the very same boat wrt. HD/SDD technology scaling in the future. That is, they're both fine together, or both in troubles together.
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:34:46
Precisely because of these additional points you came up with, your research in that direction is indeed useful and crediting Monero / Cryptonote wouldn't undermine your work.
@_date: 2015-06-04 08:43:41
You're right many people in Bitcoin don't like alts but recognize at least the usefulness to test new ideas in the wild. I find it frustrating then that this pool of innovation is often ignored alltogether and that research re-done seemingly from scratch.   
It's not that hard, if we have an issue with the block size and want to think about seriously, to start by looking at all existing innovative propositions in that field...   
   
Note that some core devs do follow these kind of developments though, G. Maxwell is well aware of the inner working of Monero for instance.

The joy of using a centralized service for an increased privacy...
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:27:12
It does not act like cash because it's fully traceable, by anyone with a simple internet connection. And since there isn't a government that enforces fungibility by law, we'll see fungibility being attacked more and more frequently as anyone is free to do so.   
Assuming Bitcoin is an incarnation of cash made digital with comparable privacy properties, is a fallacy with potentially dangerous consequences for its users.
@_date: 2015-06-03 14:47:42

There are some heuristic rules to detect coinjoin transactions, but it would be only approximating a subset...
@_date: 2015-06-03 17:31:51
Cash is only traceable by police and law enforcement, not by you or I. A merchant is *forced by law* to accept a note, because governement is *enforcing fungibility*. (See [this]( link to understand why it's utterly important to enforce this).   
In a system where EVERYBODY is able to "follow the notes", fungibility is possibly in troubles. Since it's decentralized there is no governement to enforce it. Fungibility is under attack of social pressure, since everybody can point their finger to some coins and prove that it comes from a given heist, and everybody can expect you to do the same. Remember btc-e blocking the funds stolen from Evolution recently? It was a voluntary choice from them.
   
tldr; Cash is only traceable by law enforcement and gov is enforcing fungibility by law. Bitcoin is traceable by everyone and there is nobody to enforce fungibility.   
I argue that voluntary fungibility does not work.

Mmm not quite. Darkwallet/coinjoin is pretty weak. The best we know today that is feasible in terms of performance is a combination of ring signatures and stealth addresses. Monero is running that since a a year, and should be seen as an experiement even more than Bitcoin, but the mechanisms are pretty encouraging in terms of privacy/fungibility. It's also running an dynamic block size. :)

There cannot be "duplicate" transactions in the blockchain. No transactions that conflicts with each other (spending the same input(s)) can be present together in the blokchain.  
   
There is no "malformed hash", either.   
   
The only possible thing to do along the lines you suggest is to scan the blockchain for transactions that have the same output to the same address, where the second one would be the one mtgox mistakenly sent thinking the first one never confirmed (while it did but with a different hash). But the false positives would be *enormous*, I doubt it would be meaningful.

It does the same thing as: iterating over possible private keys starting from 1, then 2, etc... then saying "uh-oh! I found some addresses that are weak and can crack them quickly!". Of course it will be true for all addresses whose private key is between 1 and few millions...

* Checking outputs for duplicate:   
   MtGox send a transaction A to you, you modify it throuth "malleability" and have transaction A' being confirmed, with all the same outputs.   
 MtGox never sees transaction A confirming, so they send transaction B to you (assuming you cheat them successfully).   
The thing is transaction A (or A') and B can have a totally different list of outputs, only one will be the same: the one that is your own withdrawal. The rest might be change they send in a different manner, etc. So you cannot match a list against another list, it's just one amount with another similar amount in another transaction. Even if you manage to restrict that to transactions originating from MtGox (assuming you can), there would still be a lot of false positive.   
   
* Hash malformed: Hashes are never malformed. There is just several correct possibilities for the same transaction, I don't think you can distinguish a transaction that was likely changed on purpose. I'm not 100% sure of technical details here, though.

A pitty your post looks like a rant, no need to be rude here. After all nobody is forcing anyone whether to be a member or even whether to give them any legitimacy.
Your question is very relevant, though.  
My personal opinion is that, at least currently, we don't need *anything* at the international level. 
For regulation/legal/lobbying aspects? This is relevant at national level (maybe European too), but internationally what are we going to do, give a speech at the UN?  
The last justificiation is often "yeah but who would pay for Gavin, we need to fund the development". I completely disagree with this: look at linux, it is where it is now without an "international stuff" to look upon it and fund developers. Linus Torvalds and other important devs are working for companies that recognize and tend to promote their work for linux, because it must feel some of their own interests. This is precisely the position of Jeff Garzik: hired partly because of deep bitcoin knowledge, and encouraged by bitpay to keep taking part in bitcoin development. Everyone's interest filled... To me this will become the future. No international foundation involved whatsoever.

Andy, regarding 1, I have a couple of questions.     
a) I know the Monero team is working on multisig transactions that exactly as you explain will look identicall to "usual" ring ones. Have you been in touch with them on this specific topic? It would be a pity if this R&amp;D would be conducted completely in parallel to reach pretty much the same conclusions/output.   
b) As you correctly point out, the initial analysis on security in the cryptonote white paper is light, and their authors completely (not just "somewhat" as you gently write it...) discredited. Nevertheless the Monero team did a very thorough evaluation of the crypto involved in the protocol, by hiring several academic cryptographers/mathematicians to do the auditing. Have you been in touch with the experts involved, or have you done your own evaluation from scratch without considering this previous work?   
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:31:41

Just take a rest of this subreddit (and of bitcointalk). In real life I see many bitcoiners that have different, even antagonist political views, nevertheless they are convinced bitcoin fits their own mind frame or point of view and not those of the others.  
They are also much more open minded that what we can see on internet. 
The impression of consensus (going in a direction you don't like) that you describe is stronger online, and especially here I'd say.  
Anyway, we can find that it's a pitty, but it's nothing that would make it 'fail', I strongly disagree with your conclusion.

It affects fungibility, a core property of a currency. That might be a weak value *to you*, but that affects the currency as a whole.

Well, to be honest I think you should show first that you've looked into what was done so far, what is being done now. And hence, what you would like to provide as added value.

"A way to honor the guy" is completely subjective.
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:00:54
Mix with who? Other people in the same situation: that wouldn't reduce the taint. Other people with cleaner coins: why would they do that, thereby reducing the value of their clean coins?
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:19:58




Yes, that is what I call at the same time. Will also be a day of waiting if, on that day, you're the only one willing to mix. Also your amount needs to be similar to those of others at that time, to mitigate correlation.   
The mixing in Monero is backed in at the cryptographic layer, and is completely passive. For instance, you can sign a rign-signature transaction on an offline computer, print it, then scan it and broadcast it later on another computer. The only thing you need to create a private transaction is the blockchain.   
   
You are right that it is in any case "mixing", which is open to sybill attacks. In the case of coinjoin, it could be from people at the time you're mixing. In the case of Monero, it could be from people that used Monero in the past. The former is a small set, the latter is a larger set. (By the way this is the reason why using Bytecoin is dangerous - apart from being a scam - because the blockchain was 80% premined, the privacy is strongly weakened as a single entity controls 80% of the outputs you'll mix with).  
   


   
This is obviously true. Though it's not like Monero has not been scrutinized (and is not right now) at all. First it relies on academic cryptographic research from the 90's, not exactly super new. Second, there are ongoing efforts to deepen our understanding of the level of privacy that can be achieved that way. See the research reports [here]( or the research of Gregory Maxwell and Andrew Poelstra on the topic.  A. Poeltsra also peer-reviewed the "cryptonote whitepaper".   
All this doesn't mean it's rock-solid, but it's not something that is baseless or came out of the blue either.   
   
That being said, I wouldn't encourage anybody to throw any significant amount of money in it. You rightfully recall that it should be seen as an experiment, even more so than Bitcoin.   
@_date: 2015-05-05 09:58:13
This is absolutely true. The interesting take of Cryptonote/Monero is to also let markets determine *the block size*. This is achieved by miners earning a smaller block reward if they exceed the current soft limit (this limit is computed based on the median of the last N blocks). Then it's their choice to do so if it's economically profitable (because they can include more transaction fees and that outweights the smaller block reward).
  
You should look at it, it's actually a very simple mechanism and works infinitely better than the hardcoded size in bitcoin that is now becoming a headache...
@_date: 2015-05-05 10:10:57
Then don't do altcoins, but look at interesting new ideas for bitcoin there at least.
  
For the second part of your sentence, can't really answer that much of an argument :)
@_date: 2015-05-18 10:27:17
No. By the way HD constructions don't help over "old style" random wallets (like that of bitcoin-qt). Of course both are better than reusing addresses, but that's all. Because the transaction is out there in the clear, sending from your address A to pay X, and send change back to your address B, leaves a trail between A and B, no matter how you obtain A and B.   
It's still all transparent compared to using a combination of stealth addresses (proposed for Bitcoin too, but not very practical) + ring signatures (new beast in town entirely). The former hides the destination while the later hides the origin of funds in transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-18 07:00:41


   
Even in such a case Bitcoin's fungibility would remain very weak, possibly too weak to work as the censorship-free currency and store of value we expected it to be.   
Monero's fungibility is way stronger (it's private *by default*, transparent *on demand*). Dash is just an ugly hack additionally to an instamined scam.
@_date: 2015-05-29 12:01:31


   
This is absolutely ridiculous :D
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:29:50
Everything boils down to whether the 750,000 btc loss is true, partly true, or not at all. If it's true, there is absolutely no way somebody could buy those missing coins without skyrocketing the price. It would require billions, litteraly.
@_date: 2015-05-15 12:21:25
There is some material taken without any citation from this presentation:    
The first part of this presentation is about privacy, and it dives deeper than the article posted by OP because it shows how privacy relates to fungibility of currencies, and not just why it's good to be private at a personal level. The second part is specific to Monero, might be interesting to those Bitcoiners that are technically inclined.
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:34:45
I want to scan and touch everything :p
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:46:33


   
Sorry but this is wrong, for instance coinjoin allows timing correlation attacks. In terms of usability, it also requires to have enough other people willing to "join" with you at the very same time you want to make a private transaction.   
   


   
If the weakest link is that with which your identity is revealed, I agree with you. But that doesn't say it all: once your identity is revealed, a transparent blockchain potentially reveals a lot of information, and mitigating this requires to know how bitcoin works to the root, which we can't expect from the average person. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:37:40
Asking your *friends* to pay? Was it easy? (Honest question)
@_date: 2015-05-18 08:37:40
The new cryptographic primitives such as ring signatures, used in Monero, are redundant? With what exactly?   
There are many long-standing bitcoiners that acknowledged the relevance of this new technology, they can harldy be all defined as "greedy speculators". Read up a bit and educate yourself before putting everything in the same bag.
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:37:07
Agree with all your points about irrelevance to speak in the name of Core. Though a reaction, at the personal level then, other than dumbly attacking back would be more productive. Greg reaction is the opposite of constructive, and reads almost childish after the conciliary OP (even though OP might make wrong statements).

How do they come up with numbers for individuals?? Are they talking about addresses instead?
@_date: 2016-01-28 15:43:59
This and this again.   
Some forms of inflation might be the only way to secure a blockchain in the long run. Having a finite supply is raising many questions nobody has conclusive answer about.   
On the one side, you have those that want to raise fees with block space scarcity and thus a fee market,  on the other side those who want to raise fees primarily by number of transactions (within limits of what is a technically acceptable blockchain) so as to preserve the user experience above all. Each side has very good arguments about the non-sustainability of the other side. A lot of them boils down to an underlying long-term discoumfort: nobody knows for sure what will work to provide enough miners' incentivization while preserving the user experience.   
Dismissing epidermically something because you hear "inflation" isn't the right way to think carefully about how to solve this fundamental, big unknown. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:58:58


   
In this case the attack would not target filling the blocks, but would anyway have the same effect of delaying transactions of the average Joe with a normal fee. Average Joe would need to wait or send with a higher fee (and would have to guess, higher by how much, and maybe re-re-send, etc.). Instead of competing for space, transactions would compete for space+fees. I fail to see how it would mitigate the effects of such an attack.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:59:32
Your critics of the OP are acceptable but it's sad you answer just that. It reads as a complete refusal of any mention or consideration of self-critics (self as on behalf of Core). Death threats aren't fun, but they are a sure way to end the discussion by dismissing all other points that seem surely futile in comparison.   
Eric is not making any valuable point here that you'd want to mention or respond to? Or even better bounce of that and try to improve the general situation? He and all readers only deserve to know how much he's wrongly accusing you?  
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:52:36
True, but that isn't hard either. The reasons mentioned against raising the cap were never that it was difficult from a coding perspective.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:37:15


With a protocol-only narrow view maybe, but many people (and the vast bulk blablabla... of the ecosystem) believe it is certainly not the case if you consider the broad picture of all software deployed in the industry. *Especially* with the tight time frame due to segwit being seen as the required short term bump, bringing a sense of rush and urgency.

I suggest you avoid making seemingly-obvious-but-plain-wrong suggestions...   
There are stuff out there that contradict what you think is obvious/unavoidable, and provide much more privacy than Bitcoin despite having a public ledger (which is required in a decentralized consensus system). You simply have no clue about them.
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:32:13
99% are scam, and are mostly crap.
1% are honest and useful.
An example that some alts provide is an opaque blockchain bringing more fungibility to the table. Bitcoin has been thought of as a transparent blockchain from the start and adding more privacy to it is hard.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:05:52
If you mean the time and effort to keep up is costly, that is right.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:34:50
So now (lack of) fungibility is the hot topic and it's ok to be worried about?   
Just few months ago half of this sub was still convinced that either Bitcoin was perfectly fungible "because coinjoin" (lol) or that Bitcoin was just fine as it was "fungible enough in practice" (re-lol).   
The conservatism and blindness to actual or potential issues witnessed in this community is regularly depressing me. :/   
@_date: 2016-01-12 18:16:00
This is written as it would factualy present the current landscape and the two sides (though now with all variants we have way more than two sides that are hardly all fitting in big and small blockers). However your writing is in fact very, obviously, subjective.
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:10:42
Interesting, thanks!   
The question is unduly presented there with a conspiracy tone though. The most important is that this is a division as a matter of fact, doesn't matter if somebody tries to play with it or not. Some people want a transparent blockchain as it is (I'd say mostly business and the "industrial" crypto space), and some want a more opaque and fungible blockchain (I'd say mostly individuals in the community).   
It won't play out smoothly for sure. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 06:29:01
There are mechanics that would support your second point without having a fixed size though. See Monero's quadratic penalty for instance.   
Granted, they might be unworkable with a null block reward.
@_date: 2016-11-28 19:50:24


     
It is not inflationary as the money supply is not exponential. The minimum block reward does not depend on the outstanding money created or on the time elapsed. It is simply constant and the ratio block_reward/outstanding_money_supply tends to zero. It is referred to as "dis-inflationary".   
Not to be picky :) but "inflationary" has such a bad connotation in the crypto space that it is important to note you do not need to have it to put this mechanism in place.
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:33:49
Only if you assume that the outstanding supply equates the available supply. It is not the case because of key loss for various reasons (decease, hardware failure, poor backup for small amounts etc.). If you assume that the amount of coins lost forever over time depends (inversely) on the price at a given point in time, and that a larger available supply drives the price down (and vice-versa), you get some interesting equilibrium of constant available supply despite the constant reward. That is, the system stabilizes when there are as many coins lost as coins created.   
These are (very) long term considerations, and poorly formalized as of yet, but an interesting line of thoughts to explore.
@_date: 2015-08-22 12:41:34
Blockchain analysis should also be a concern if you care about anonymity. Much more important than anonymity on p2p network actually.

@_date: 2015-08-09 12:00:18


   
I would go further: in a decentralized system, thus without legal enforcement of fungibility, privacy is a *requirement* to fungibility. It is also the only possible way to achieve it.
@_date: 2015-08-29 11:17:11


   
This opacity-by-default-transparency-on-demand is achieved quite far in cryptonote/monero, from which the "confidential transactions" sidechain principles are largely inspired. So we're not talking 50 years here for things to happen.

You should have said "current feasibility" instead of "viability". Because that only works as long as there aren't more than ~7tx/s *on average*, otherwise the length of the transaction list in memory pool expand continuously and transactions start dropping from it.

They premined 80%, but then kept mining when it was known to be a scam. They might very well seat on &gt;90% of the supply. They've also very likely been faking volume on hitbtc (the only exchange that "showed" BCN volume) to give the apparence of a decent market.    
So the "market cap" that you see now on coinmarketcap for BCN is pretty much whatever they want it to be by selling to themselves...   
   
If I premine and own 100% of the 1M binaryCoins and sell one for 1BTC (to myself), does that make the marketcap of binaryCoin 1M BTC?

It's a bit pessimistic but sounds sensible.   
   
Privacy &amp; fungibility features though can be backed in as part of the cryptographic protocol right from the start. This gives some hope as no compromission is then possible, even from greedy future ourselves. I think about cryptonote/monero for instance.

When the Berlin wall fell down, the STASI shredded millions of documents to cover their tracks.   
*What they didn't know at that time* is that some years later we were to invent scanners and algorithms that could properly put together many of the seamingly-useless pieces. Thanks to some recovered documents people actually ended up convinced in court.   
   
The bitcoin blockchain is here forever yet everyone focuses on the *current* state-of-the-art in terms of analytics. Reality check: oh snap it's already not the same as 3 years ago (remember when Bitcoin privacy was something to brag about?). What about in 3 years from now? In 10 years?

Appart from this being cumbersome, useless if done in a centralized manner, and subject to DoS, there's another major issue: you can end up with coins "strongly tainted" (as in clearly coming from a recent heist/scam everybody know about). If you're a good buddy just keen on your privacy, and end up with the coins of the real bad guys, your final situation is likely worse than if you did nothing. It's well possible in the future it will have some LE/court consequence.   
(If CoinJoin was so perfect I don't think G Maxwell wanted to push the "confidential transactions" sidechain stuff btw).   
Additionally, Coinjoin (or that sidechain pie in the sky) helps with privacy that is correct, but not with fungibility.

Amount and timing correlations are always possible between the in and out points, agreed.   
Though the intermediaries in the case of Monero can't compromise you, which is different from non-private blockchains: if you do btc -&gt; ltc -&gt; btc, and somebody spies on the service you use to convert, you're fucked.   
If you do btc -&gt; xmr -&gt; btc, you're not. Anything left to figure out trails then are amount and timing correlations, of which you must take care astutely on both ends.

I think provable fairness which appeared together with Bitcoin is an absolute plus for players. The little house edge (compared to legacy casinos) is also something players can enjoy. In bars where I live, the physical gambling machines house edge are set to ~30%, *this* is a scam. (And this isn't even provably fair, it's simply "approved" by whatever authority who looks at the source code every X months).

@_date: 2015-11-01 19:56:38


   
The privacy you can expect from the blockchain *stricly decreases* over time, as more information becomes available through other channels, and then as you say new on-blockchain data (transactions/addresses) can get put into context thanks to these information, triggering potential cascades of new discoveries. This is a never ending process.
@_date: 2015-03-28 14:29:25


I am one of the developer of xmr.to and this is false. Given the properties of Monero, xmr.to doesn't hold anything sensible that could compromise the user privacy, even if we were malicious. The only thing potentialy sensible is the IP address, and there are ways to mitigate this (TOR or I2P).

"The service is mostly about an altcoin, so it belongs on . Moreover, it looks heavily astroturfed - probably someone was engaging in vote manipulation from non-Reddit source."

Wat worries me most is that because many people have a wrong grasp of Bitcoin's (lack of) fungibility, there is very little push towards improving it.

@_date: 2015-03-21 22:01:26
The issue with coin mixing as you rightfully mention is that it is then clear you engaged in voluntary "obfuscation" activity, and such activity could fall under the laws, or put you in a lot of troubles once you feel your tax report and are asked for some bitcoin addresses.   
This problem is inherent to transparent blockchains. Bitcoin cannot be fully fungible/private. That doesn't diminish its utility completely, but it is simply not the exact tool most people thought it was. There are other cryptos that are based on opaque blockchains. In the future it's likely that both transparent and opaque ledgers will live, serving different purposes.
@_date: 2015-11-02 10:39:34
Sure. What's important is that every user has a correct estimation of what to expect or not to expect, so he can make educated choices over what to do or not with Bitcoin and how to do it.   
   
To me that's the biggest challenge: people not having a clear grasp of this and therefore not taking it into account adequately. I am sure most silkroad users of 2012/13 would have a different behavior in the same situation nowadays... I am also sure in two years, most people who care about their privacy will have different assumptions and behavior in terms of what is sufficiently private or not compared to today.

Sure, I agree with you as of today, sorry for the confusion. I meant future laws: it would be pretty easy for a legislator to say something like "accepting coins that are either directly coming from or strongly tainted with outputs on black list X is illegal". Then everytime you mix you would be at ristk to receive "tainted" coins.

There is a high chance the coins are even more tainted than those you start with. Because if you have tainted coins you'd better get paid to mix ("maker") rather than pay to mix ("taker"), no?

A sidechain will then act pretty much as a mixer today: you send coin there to mix them, you then transfer back to mainchain (since many services will require coins on mainchain). Time correlations "attack" will be easy compared to a blockchain that is 100% mandatory-mixed: Good luck anonymizing 1000 BTC on such a sidechain.

It's ok, he got you to handle them.
@_date: 2015-11-01 22:44:16
Then I'll provide one instance where your example would indeed decrease over time, let me know if you agree.   
Say you receive a coinbase transaction (new block) to address *A*. At that very moment those coins are completely fresh and can't be related to anything else; on the other hand they haven't been used for anything yet... Later on you want to send 30BTC to address *C*, and to do this you merge the coinbase input (of 25BTC) received with another input of 5BTC received on another of your address, *B*.   
The (possibly far away in the future day) a trail from the origin of the 5BTC on address *B* can be established (say you obtain them from a website that get hacked), then the privacy of *A* is falling entirely as it's obvious it's yours.
   
Think of it in the bigger picture and it becomes rather obvious: the blockchain is a record of all Bitcoin activities that is here forever. Of course the analysis of it that will take place in the future will only weaken the privacy, never strenghten it.   
In practice, we can often observe this privacy decreasing over time by the "discoveries" dug over time and posted online. The OP for instance, or the proof that Zou Thong was lying during the bitcoinica "funds recovery", etc. Some of these come from better analysis tools: well, they will keep improving forever. And some of these, as I explained, come from new pieces of the larger puzzle that can be put together.   
   
Put differently: in terms of semantic the data in the blockchain is forever loosing entropy.

If I builded an online service that makes me earn bitcoins, but that service is sadly operating in a kind of gray area in my country since as you know law tends to lag behind technological innovation. I get to be active on the social sides of things, though, so I meet many people in real-life about bitcoin and such. I want to sell them some, but I have issues if the bitcoins I sell are linked to my service, because people can recognize this easily and many are not comfortable with.   
In this case, it's not so much about anonymity but more about fungibility. Though the two are strongly tied.   
   
(Note I could use mixers/tumbers of some kind, but (i) it could be worse as after more digging the coins after tumbling could be linked to much worse stuff like drugs or whatever could be under actual prosecution somewhere, and (ii) it would cost me money, usually a percentage, and I may also have to trust a service on the internet - which is antithetic to bitcoin)
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:35:55
You can actually prune it a lot by removing old signatures (they take most space in a tx), keeping only key images. Then you don't have a UTXO concept like in Bitcoin, which is what you are probably referring to. However stating that "it won't scale" is a bold extreme conclusion. You can access old key images in log (n), and apart from that simply need Moore's law to do the job in terms of pure hardware storage.

Monero is what teens buying weed on SR thought bitcoin was: anonymous electronic cash.   
   
People thinking bitcoin is anonymous remind me of people thinking paper shredding machines destroy information: it is just obfuscation. With enough patience, and methods yet to be invented, most of things currently happening on the bitcoin blockchain could be traced to real-world identities.   
Same fallacy, or bias, as the East-German Stasi when shredding millions of papers thinking they'll destroy secret documents and cover stuff forever: it only took the invention of much more powerful computers, scanners, and some specialized software to put pieces back together and bring many documents to light again. People back then had no idea this would be possible in the future.  
Replace "computers and scanners" with "new machine learning techniques", and you have the future of bitcoin. I won't mention that any powerful entity having a lot of information *outside* of the bitcoin system could additionally easily correlate data more than most of us can imagine.

For the exchanges, what are the advantages of this over using Ripple?
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:13:34
First of all, typically you can assume it is the same entity that had control over all inputs, if they include them in the same transaction.   
   
Anyway, what you describe is true, and is technically the way bitcoin works. It means you cannot trace back every single satoshis to a given initial block X, and know their full history until they've reached their current destination. It does make bitcoin *a little bit* fungible, since you can't have perfect knowledge at the level of the smallest atomic values. Agree with you up to this point.   
Now I disagree with your conclusion: you explain rightfully that bitcoin is at least *a little bit* fungible and conclude that it is thus fungible. Sophist logic to me.
Unlike my fate, you cannot think of fungibility as being only a binary attribute. If it were, and I would follow the same logic as you do, I could easily demonstrate that bitcoin is not *perfectly fungible*, and would conclude that therefore it is not fungible at all. (A simple example of a drug dealer sending you bitcoins from a wallet later seized by authorities would do it...).   
   
Fungibility is a complex property in the case of digital currencies. I don't think it's even just a linear scale on which you could "place" them, let alone as I said just a binary answer "yes it is", "no it is not". What is sure is that there is a very common overestimation of how strong bitcoin's fungibility actually is.   
   
Think of it practically: if bitcoin's fungibility is already so good it suits all our needs, why do we have to trust mixers/tumblers that cost us money? 
If bitcoin's fungibility is already so good it suits all our needs, why do we have A. Poelstra and G. Maxwell working on strong and fundamental improvements? (see

Well, that's not exactly how provable fairness works. Look at the satoshidice system for a canonical exemple: you don't need to have an overall view of the statistics on every bets to be sure that a single one is fairly treated. I am sure you are honest and just want your game to succeed, but in theory you have the possibility to cheat by increasing the odd for a rat to win of, say 0.5%, and it would go unnoticed. 
As soon as you use pseudo-random variables somewhere, and that you have control over there values, you lose provable fairness.

There is obviously no general answer to this, it depends of some factors such as from which device you want to use your wallet, what is your own technical level, what is your acceptable level of risk taking (by trusting a third party) versus ease of use...  
But in short, leave them on coinbase if you trust them enough not to be hacked or run away with your coins, and the ease of use and accessability through several devices is a primary concern for you. Use a local wallet if you have the technical capabilities to properly back it up and secure your computer, and you don't want to depend on any 3rd party.

You can write me a private message if you have some precisions on the CSS issue.

What do you mean by porn being blocked? On search engines? Access to websites themselves completely impossible? I found this incredible...

I agree. I'm not against pools at all, but encouraging the larger one is just the wrong criteria for an award about pools.

Something that relies so heavily on bounties and on promising a nice ROI to those donating to this address, rather than relying on its intrinsic positive aspects in order to reach "success", is very suspicious.

You can do that without destroying coins easily. First you take the sha256 to be "burried down" as a bitcoin ECDSA private key, and generate the corresponding public key then bitcoin address from it. Then you send any amount to this address, and immediately send the whole amount back from this address (to any other address you control). You will only lose transaction fees in the process, which are not destroyed but go to the miners, and you don't polute the utxo set as the full output to the crafted address was used, and must not be stored anymore.

LOL. Try again.

Gosh, reddit picked up my forum avatar as picture

Looks VERY suspicious that they would 1) sell bitcoins for credit card payments that can be charged back and 2) sell at this price.

That's the beauty of entropy in a provably fair system only. This is not the case here.

If by chance you're using firefox on linux, it is known to render very poorly canvas animations (that we use). If so, try with chrome. If not, what OS/browser do you have, so we can try to optimize if possible?

Yes, the 200BTC mistake here:
AM paid it back to the guy. If you substract 200, it is consistent with usual values.

They'll be changed into direct shares.

I like that analogy too, it speaks to everyone! But I tend to use it even with "stock of internet" :)

Are you going to try to overclock it? Would be cool to see what you can achieve!

This has been discussed since a long time, I think there is a consensus that increasing use of these smaller units is a positive thing. It is just spreading too slow. However, the emphasis is more on the "milli" (1/1000th, mBTC) rather than the cBTC.  
Bitcoin-qt allows to show amounts in mBTC (as well as micro) for instance.

I missed it! I wanted to unsuscribed/suscribed to be the 50,000th!!!

Many people still don't grasp what is the purpose of transaction fees

IMHO, what is important is not investigating whether the site owner is cheating in practice.  
What is important is to know the fact that he can easily do so in theory: this site is provably fair to its users, not to its investors!  
  
I am suprised this didn't trigger significant concerns as now the average bitcoiners become more and more sensible to provable fairness as players, though they completely forget about it as investors, despite the gigantic amounts at play.  
  
The only explanation I see is that as long as the profits were positive, nobody wanted to face or pay attention to this fact.  
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:21:04
Awesome :)

I am sorry for your loss.  
About his wallet, assuming your do not have more information, if you gain access to his computer (and cell-phone if possible) you can try the followings:  
* Open his browser(s), and check the history or go for the most usual online wallet services. Maybe he recorded the password in the browser for them. You might need 2FA and thus his cell-phone.  
* Check for local wallets on the hard drive. There is a very high probability that the wallet will be encrypted, but who knows.  
  
For both points, if the passwords are unknown, you can try few things that you might think of, but appart from that there is little you can do. Nobody on earth could decrypt a local wallet file if the password was well chosen and longer than a dozen characters.  Edit: If it's an online wallet that can access the funds (not blockchain.info), you may try something by going the official way?  
  
You can try to get passwords for other stuff (e-mails, facebook, etc. which are likely to be recorded in the browser for convenience, or in a smartphone), and maybe they'll be the one also used for the wallet.  
But if he was very careful about security, and he didn't leave any instructions, there is nothing you can do.  
Again, condolences.

Plus: in the process, the faulty noob would also learn how to sign messages and prove ownership.

From your post I assume dns in troubles? Site seems reachable right now, probably heavy load due to labcoin holders reaching final panic sell.
