The best/craziest part of 1984 is when O’Brien was explaining that reality only exists in your consciousness, kind of like solipsism. It is the party’s objective to control your mind from birth so that you project the reality that the party wants.

Yes I think I know what you mean.
In the Book Sapiens, Harari says that pretty much everything is a belief system that we create. Belief systems have the power to unite us unlike anything else... so that’s one of the main themes... sapiens use belief systems to organize and unite.
He talks about the capitalist belief system which I found very gripping. He talks about how more people die from eating rather than starving, how the system outputs seemingly more than what we put in, etc. He talks about how it destroys other things in the process. Essentially he is saying that the entire modern world economy is an insane belief system that isn’t logical and is not real, in a way. 
Side rant: The most overused word is communities. Communities are seldom. What we think are communities are actually networks of people. Networks where people simply know of each other. A community is something where people know each other by name, hold each other accountable, know their personal life, meet regularly, and have real relationships. There are not a lot of communities. When politicians say something about communities this or that, it means nothing.

I watched the entire episode. I get his pitch. 
I do not get the economics of it though. Could someone proficient in economics explains how this works?
This is an old (old as economics) debate, I can’t remember the term for this idea, the idea that new technology kills jobs. 
I do agree with him that sometime in the future, when unemployment is astronomical due to robots/AI, then UBI might make sense.

Maybe buy some more properties. But if bitcoin outperforms real estate by insane amounts then this might be a silly idea.

Read The Creature From Jekyll Island.
It will come to your understanding that taxes are not what runs government. It’s the creation of debt that runs everything. There’s actually no need for taxes since everything is monetized debt. But we are taxed anyway. It’s pretty evil. Inflation is the true, real tax. Income tax is more of a whitewash to mask the real source of taxation which is inflation.
Weird concept at first. But once you get it your mind will blow and then know why bitcoin is truly important.

What you think is being payed for in taxes is being payed for in debt.
The point is, there is no need for taxes since everything is payed for with money that was inflated into existence. It’s as if taxes are there to whitewash this fact.

@_date: 2019-01-21 22:06:43
This is the crux of the issue. Governments function by creating debt, not collecting taxes. If they couldn’t create debt the tax rate would have to be so high that it would cause instant chaos.

@_date: 2019-01-05 02:07:10
All dollars have been created by monetizing debt/nothing. If all debt was paid there would be no dollars. The dollars you make and the taxes you pay are an illusion. Taxes are in place to keep people from discovering how the dollar system really works. Inflation is the real tax and taxes don’t actually need to be in place because all money is debt that has been created.

@_date: 2019-05-03 08:54:44
Hopefully pointing out the obvious, but much more money is created through fractional reserve banking than the physical printing of money. I’m sure “printing” is used interchangeably as printing and/or new debt created from lending.
