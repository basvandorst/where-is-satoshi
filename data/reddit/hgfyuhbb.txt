He can't cuz he's lying.

Indeed it's sad how many of the big players back then sold us out. Even more sad how noone is pushing for giving our money back after that scam exchange allegedly made hundreds of millions last year.
They got hacked, stole 36% of our money and they're not giving it back now that they are (allegedly) in good financial shape. 
Hope bitfinex is eventually prosecuted for that theft.

Good thing we have Bitcoin to protect our wealth from thiefs like you.
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:01:55
You're a fuking idiot if you think that, which doesn't surprise me after reading this garbage post. Hope they put you in jail along with Phil you scammer.

Everyone is charged for medical attention, even in your socialist shithole. Doctors don't work for free and drugs cost money.
Do you wanna pay the honest way for your actual usage or do you want the charge hidden in 20% vat?

His statements are only 'stupid' is you trust bitfinex at their word. If that is the case you are a fool.
Bitfinex got hacked, stole 36% of our money so they can stay in business and they're not giving it back now that they are (allegedly) in good financial shape. How much they made last year? Hundreds of millions? 
Rot in hell bitfinex. I'll join any lawsuit vs these scammers.

GTFO this sub statist trash.

I'm retarded so let's witch-hunt journalists cuz I'm too stupid to read.
What GS said is that people earlier in the year (idiots like you basically) misjudged how quickly Goldman would open that trading desk. The business insider article was correct, the trading desk won't open any time soon. 
OP is people like you that give crypto supporters a bad name. Why don't you focus that energy on something useful like lobbying for companies to accept Bitcoin.

Where's my money then u fuking liar?

Plenty of regulated financial companies were US regulated and still went under. Refco, fxcm. Remember that futures companies that put customers money into Greek bonds few years ago?
Don't blindly trust anyone. Only keep the minimum you need to trade with other parties.

A token is not money you retard. Go fuk urself and fuk all the trash upvoting you. This is why this joke of a space will never be taken seriously, it's full of scammers and liars like yourself.
The nerve of you people ganging up on victims for complaining about being stolen from and name calling, you are literal human trash, a vomit that should've been aborted pre-birth.
You are prolly one of bitfinex 'investors', a stupid retard who thought keeping that fake money was a good idea. The only comfort to me is that you will continue to make stupid and immoral choices like that until you lose all your ill-gotten gains and prolly join Phil the thief in jail.

'revolutionary' aka illegal. Those tokens didn't trade at their supposed face value for a year after the 'hack'. I'll level with you bro, the only ppl that kept those tokens  are braindead. 
Furthermore I don't get how this scam is still going, 90% of the people that used to trade at bitfinex stopped after the 'hack'. Thus the majority of their volume was and prolly is generated in house. So you can add trading with customer funds or outright faking their volume to the long list of crimes being perpetrated over there. 
It's a house of cards, no smart person would ever hold a cent in bitfinex with everything we know now. How's that audit coming up? It's sooooo hard to prove that solvency.
@_date: 2018-10-16 17:25:16
Cryptsy was us company too, so was Madoff.
@_date: 2018-10-08 07:32:13
Yes I'm stupid for being stolen from and credited fake tokens that were trading at nowhere near their face value for a year after the issuance.
I should've sued your scammy little operation 2 years ago. Maybe I still will, the statue of limitations has still not run out.
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:53:08
???? Those problems persisted into early 2018 and only ended due to ppl losing interest after the bubble burst. Rewriting history already? At least wait until we die first jezz...
@_date: 2018-10-07 23:45:53
Fuk bitfinex. If they were solvent why aren't they paying back the 36% they stole from me and everyone else after the 'hack'?
It's either A: they're solvent and they're not paying back what they stole even tho now they're making big profits. Or B: they're not solvent and area lying. So either thiefs or liars, my guess would be both.
BTW showing proof of customer held coins proves nothing as liabilities can exceed the deposited coins. But as we bitterly knew bitfinex thinks that our coins belong to them.
 If bitfinex was solvent they would've done a legit audit years ago. Their last auditor gave up after being unable to do just that after years of trying.
Any idiot still holding a dime at this scamshop deserves to lose it all during the inevitable collapse.

Can you check if hotels.com is still allowing giftcard payments? I noticed the redemption sites  or    now lead to error pages.
They also seem to have scrubbed all other webpages where giftcards were mentioned before. If you search hotels.com giftcards all the search result pages on hotels.com now lead to the default home page.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:14:46
Yes can't load it from here. I'm from Europe dunno if that makes a difference.
Sorry, we couldn’t find the page you were looking for
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:36:51
It seems to be a mobile only issue, which is weird because the sites worked fine on mobile before. Works on PC.
Can I use the USA gift card to book hotels in Europe as European? The international gift card is out of stock wherever I check.
