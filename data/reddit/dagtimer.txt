The bitcoin religion has invented tithing to the church I see.

It's weird how when people mention credit card rewards everyone has to jump in and say that that 2% secretly gets charged to you through abstract market forces but when stuff like this is posted it's just taken as bitcoin giving you free money by magic.

That was the idea satoshi had and the idea the whitepaper professed, but that is long gone and even satoshi accepted bitcoin would not be P2P forever and was going to go to a server/client model

In 4 hours from 8pm to midnight this year on black friday walmart processed 10 million transactions. 
But 100 million over 7 years is impressive too I guess?

Is there any reason that would even be good for bitcoin beyond the words "federal reserve" being some weird dog whistle thing for goldbugs? 
Why is a higher interest rate better for bitcoin in any way?

A guy who needs you to invest in bitcoin to stay employed wants you to think the price of bitcoin will rise!?!?!?
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:57:47
used to be that way. In the old day users mined and bitcoin was p2p too.

Money is literally the concept of extrinsic value. That is what makes money money.

It's used because the more realistic measures make bitcoin look really small and unimportant.

Andreas is against the founder of bitcoin being found because he is one of the people that trades heavily on the mystic founder myth crap and trying to be some sort of disciple for the lost leader and he's scared satoshi might say something mean about AA and ruin his career.

Before it hits zero it will spend about 80 years at near zero

It's always weird conspiracy theories about specific people manipulating the price instead of any belief in any sort of actual market forces. 
Maybe it's not 500 dollars because no one wants to buy your bitcoins for 500 dollars, not because everyone secretly does but some space whale is stopping everyone.

Do they want that? Or is that thing where people give their friends bible tracts because jesus is the greatest gift of all or something.

Cutting how much we pay miners definitely makes sense to pair with assigning them more work! The most free market of solutions!

I suggest you don't make a "next time"

Economically bitcoin is extremely far right so it makes sense. Social issues I think the bitcoin community is pretty scattered but I do know a lot of the big names that share their personal views on things do tend to be pretty conservative. (It's a similar crowd to the "BUY GOLD" people of course)

it mines less than a penny a day. What kind of phone plan can you buy for a penny a day? 
It's also not like it's a free penny, you'd still be paying over a penny to pay for the electricity to get you that penny. Why would anyone want to pay more money to buy electricity when they could spend less money to buy the phone plan from the phone company directly with that penny? 
The 21 sounds like it has a lot of use cases if it just magically printed free money. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:21:06
Like every plan for what the 21 computer could do always seems to rely on it generating free money then using the money to buy things.  If someone had a machine that did that then boy would it be easy to think of a lot of use cases!
@_date: 2015-11-18 20:30:05
Then sell your free electricity.

It has largely been a TERRIBLE way to save money for the past 2 years.

At one point bitcoin was a peer to peer system and a user was a miner was a node, that was a really far more inventive system than the weird multi part client and server stuff we have now.

It turns out the technology behind bitcoin isn't actually super innovative and is basically just small modifications of a bunch of old stuff or industry standards. A lot of people that got hyped up about a lot of it mistakenly thought it was new.
