Of course, those who didn’t own 1,000’s in BTC may have taken the long. If you have 1,000’s of BTC and you want to turn your money over you’d want to short it. Sell high, make money as it goes down, short fills. Take long on the next call, buy cheap, long fills, make money again. Repeat...

It has been dropping steadily since the futures. Pumped to get suckers to long, then dumped it on them steadily since.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:30:47
How would you pump the price if you’re already long BTC? You’d have to invest fiat to do that. You can take the short and make money without any fiat capital.

I need to get those new servers for [cryptothrift]( rolling in soon I guess...
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:20:38
That's one thing I don't get with a LOT of users in the crypto community.
Rather than trying to reach out to the service provider via the correct channels, users would rather get few upvotes on reddit * Look at me, I can make some noise * kind of thing. Not your fault alone, but the "redditors" who can't run quick enough with such accusations.
You might/might not be the first one to have this happen to them, but if every person does what you just did, it's highly unlikely that the service provider, regardless of what nature, will even know that they have something wrong happening.
If you had a chance to recover your losses as an apology from cavirtex, you might have just missed on it by posting here.
If we are EVER going to get Bitcoin to reach the utmost trust we all hope for, we need to act as responsible adults and stop accusing each other before checking what could be done to fix an issue.
Disclaimer: I never used/heard of these guys, I'm just replying bases on personal experience as a service provider too.

We're talking environmental impact of mining rather than if the Bitcoin system can sustain itself. Yes, you're correct. The Bitcoin system can indeed sustain itself with only 1 miner by design. As the hash rate drops, the difficulty will drop.

On behalf of cryptothrift and the team, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience and confusion we have caused.
While we do admit that it was an error on our behalf which have led to this post, we would also like to shed some light on the facts and the circumstances surrounding the matter.
First, when a user requests a refund, the only information they require to submit is a **Refund** address and a reason. **yomofos** happened to submit the wrong refund address as per this [screen shot]( (some info was deleted for the security and privacy of the user).
After investigating the matter, we refunded the amount to the buyer (manually) and an automated email was sent out  (screen shot from post).
The user then sent a new support ticket saying that the funds were sent to the wrong address, we replied advising that the funds were sent to his nominated address 
After our reply, we did not hear anything from the user, this is not unusual as users tend to stop replying to tickets when the issue is resolved. That was on April 12th as per screen shots. We closed the ticket after 48 hours (automated).
On April 20th, we received another request from the user ** (screen shot from post). It happened that Sunday and Monday are Easter weekend, we, the founders, has split the holiday so we could each take a day off to spend with our families, which led to us falling behind on support tickets and resulted in this mess.
We have already processed this refund and added some extra as an apology for the delay. We try our best to stay on top of our support tickets, but we that some times we fall behind.
Just to shed some light on the business itself and the founders. We're two family men from Sydney, we both have full time jobs and kids, we run the site between our work hours and of course late nights... very late sometimes. We have finished registering the business and we are happy to disclose any personal information, business name, business address with the public. The information isn't live yet on the site as we're looking into getting public liability insurance to have users' funds backed by insurance in case the worst comes to worst.
If you have any issues or would like any further info, give us a buzz, we'll do our best to respond with in 24 hours to all requests.

btc-e have 3fa (if that's what you wanna call it). They have the normal old email confirmation and they have the Google authentication.
You have the option to setup 2fa, but email confirmations are a must and they've existed for as long as I can remember on btc-e
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:32:12
Exactly, 2fa came out right after the "Transaction Malleability".
Edit: Sorry, my mistake.
2fa came out around 2 weeks before the "Transaction Malleability" as per below:

I'm happy to share number of sales, but not actual BTC or USD figures at this stage.
We've passed 7,800 sold items since January. With the graph showing a stead 20-30% increase every month.
@_date: 2014-05-30 12:28:23
You have a valid point. Although the same order were being sold on BitMit.
I'm not saying BitMit was perfect, but these items are not illegal, so there's no excuse for us to take them down.
There's a difference between illegal and "I am PayPal, I don't like Bitcoin and you're not allowed to buy Bitcoin with PayPal because it's against our T&amp;C's...".
Violating terms and conditions can risk your account getting suspended by the service provider, but it is not illegal.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

@_date: 2014-02-11 15:10:53
True. Something we might run into here in Australia with [cryptothrift]( once Bitcoin is recognized as a currency. We're currently viewing our options and the multisig transactions so we can leave the ball in the blockchain's features rather than the licenses (which do cost at least $30,000 a year).

Even eBay and gumtree have listings which slip through. We've been removing listings and terminating accounts on a daily basis from day one, and thanks to the help from the community we've been managing to stay as close as possible to having a clean site.

We've thought about this quite a lot before we even started cryptothrift. But when it comes to doing it and the technicalities and responsibilities that come with it... Nah, too much for a small or even medium team to handle.
You would need a community exchange similar to localbitcoin where person "x" living in NY can deliver goods from user "y" to user "z" within NY city after the coins get sent by to buyer to the exchange's address. The after delivery and confirmation from the buyer AND the post man, the funds get released to the seller, a fee gets sent to the post man. You would need people around the globe to handle this and be happy to do it for a fee as small as UPS for example.

Because we will be working as a PTY LTD and we would like to keep our personal details private. Once the company has been registered, address, phone numbers, legal name and business number will be shared with the public.
We've processed over $85k through our escrow in the past two month without a single issue and we're planning to do so before and after the legal paper work is done. We've been operating out of pocket since we started as no fees were being charged on any sold items, so we won't be going anywhere any soon :-)
@_date: 2014-01-04 04:34:28
Thanks for that, those have also been removed.
We're in the process of hiring mods and extra support staff as there's only two of us running the site at this stage and the latest updates consumed most of our time.
We're also working on a filter to flag items with specific keywords for manual moderation, this should be done in the next update, we hope.

But, on the serious side of things. When we get contacted by a service provider regarding items violating their T's&amp;C's on CryptoThrift, we do remove the listings. Not because they're scary and they have some gray laws in "x" country, but out of respect to their efforts to contact us personally and ask for items to be removed.
We operate on Australian land, but we still try out best to accommodate laws and regulations of other countries like EU and the US out of respect as well. 50%+ of our users are from the US and 30%+ are from EU.
Just to be clear, suspending them won't make much difference to the site's performance. We leave them online as we try to be lenient and tolerant toward fellow Bitcoiners whilst keeping within the boundaries of the law.
@_date: 2014-12-10 21:13:05
Firstly we wanted to thank you all for your patience over the last couple of months. We know that the site and our service has suffered without escrow enabled, but that is about to change. Effective immediately our escrow service has been re-enabled and is available on all new purchases.
We feel we have to apologize for taking so long to turn it back on. There were a series of personal circumstances with our developer that meant he just wasn’t available to fix the security hole that lead to our breach back in September. However, this has now been found, fixed, and thoroughly tested.
We hope to return to the great level of customer service that you came to expect from us. As a thank-you to our customers our escrow service will be FREE on all purchases made for the rest of 2014.
Other important updates are:
* Sold and Won items pages are now showing 90 days activity only.
* Feedback page is showing feedbacks to be awarded and to be expected for items sold or bought withint the last 60 days.
* Awaiting Payments and Outstading Payments pages are now showing items that can still be paid (haven't went over the 48 hours allowed payment period).
* Email and Display name can now be changed in the Profile Settings page.
* Messages can be replied to without having to open the message.
Features to expect:
* Affiliates system is close to being released publicly.
* Enhanced shipping system with shipping calculator and different shipping prices for international countries.
* Messaged system to become threaded.
* Featured Items.
Should you have anything else you would like to see on the site, please feel free to email us.
Merry Christmas!
Team CryptoThrift

It is a hard job. Maintaining the system, keeping the site tidy and as clean as possible as well as responding to 10s and soon 100s of support tickets daily isn't the sweetest feeling. As you said, add Bitcoin to the mix and you will get all the "I got scammed", "I want an escrow refund", "this seller looks dodgy" and we all know the drill...
We're trying to automate as much as possible of the whole process to reduce human interference in deposits, withdrawals, refunds and escrow release. So far all those have been automated, but we still need to stay in touch on a personal level with our users to make them feel welcomed and comfortable contacting us, not having to face palm every time they have to open a support request :)
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:34:09
that's exactly right...
1 BTC can send 100,000,000 transactions to different addresses. Let 1% of these check the link, you've got 1,000,000 visitors. Which $700 ad campaign can generate such traffic?

what's with the downvotes again?
@_date: 2014-08-05 04:08:27
Thanks for reporting the issue. We will definitely look into the % increase/drop in the price and place a hold on purchases in case or a sudden bug like this.
We use BitcoinAverage to pull prices, which we believe to be the most fair price for both buyers and seller. At the time of the price hike, BitcoinAverage seemed to be having issues.
We have placed a rule in place to monitor such bugs and this issue should never happen again.
We pull the price every minute, the price will now get checked and if the move is +10% over/below the previous price, the price will not change and it would stay at the same level until the price recovers to within the 10% margin.

Because it's a different IP, I would need to forward the email to my work email to process the withdrawal.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:35:36
Yes, that's right. But the wallet ignored the invalid hash and processed the valid one as a payment.

You were not being ignored, It's just been a super busy December for me and I've taken the first weekend off since a very long time. We're doing our best to:
1st, create an easy to use platform.
2nd, Keep it as clean as we can.. While some stuff might slip through, that doesn't mean we approve off and we promise we've taken a several actions against offending users.
3rd, we are legit and we've been proving ourselves for the past few months. Us not being registered as a business under a "legal" business name is hurting no one but us. We know very well how much being anonymous can effect our user base and the size of transaction that would otherwise users be going through our system. Which is why registering a legal business name is our top priority for 2014 and we won't let the financial year pass without doing so... Another reason we're trying to keep the site as clean as possible and abide with Australian laws.

Here's my experience from the recent support ticket..


Since I've started using igot I've been bragging on to every one as to how fast bank deposits and withdrawals are. But this is no longer the case...
I use to be able to get my money in my bank account within 2-3 hours from withdrawing the money. Last time, it took 4 hours to get a confirmation email that my withdrawal has been processed.
Now, I withdrew money on Sunday (72 hours ago) and it's sitting in "Pending"? Seriously? Are you guys having any kind of issues?
The amount I tried to withdraw this time is way less than the amounts I withdrew before, so I'm clueless as to why this has been pending for &gt; 72 hours.
Julie (next day):


Thank you for contacting igot.com.
We're experiencing very large volumes from past few days. 
That in turn has delayed deposits.
Another reason could be that there was no reference number added to the deposit.
Do you have the payment receipt so I can trace this for you?
Please do not hesitate to contact us for any further questions.


I did not deposit funds. I'm trying to withdraw funds TO my bank account and it's been pending since Sunday morning AEST.
Can you please process the withdrawal ASAP.
Julie: 






I hope this helps.

Yeah it sucks! I have paid a fortune in fees for the past month.
But again, as of 2 hours ago I was paying ~0.0015 per transaction. Changed the txconfirmtarget to 200 and now I'm paying a lot less yet getting the same confirmation speed.
Shouldn't the wallet already know to drop the fee to ~~0.00013~~ 0.000113 automatically when it's sufficient to include the transaction in the next block?

Might also add...
Marketplace and Auction Site
Also accepts Litecoin.
Did I mention you can also earn BTC by selling stuff there?

Thanks, this all makes sense. but without automating this process it's no good for me. I send 100s of automatic TX per day. If it was a one off TX I wouldn't worry and I'd pay the fee.

Also, Victoria from  had tweeted about the campaign.

Sorry to hear that you're unable to change your password. Please contact support, I'm sure we can fix that.
The first auction ended with 2 bids the same because buyers can auto-bid on the item with a max price, yet the price only increases by the minimum margin. When another bid is placed, the auto bid kicks in and places another bid. If it happens for the new bid to be the same price as the max auto bid, the max auto bid wins since it was placed first, yet it shows that both bids are the same value because they really are.
When a Buy Now order is placed, we do not remove the item or close the auction until a payment is received to the nominated address. This is because some people like to buy items and disappear without paying for them. That's why the auction was still active as no payment was received. That said, I do believe that we have a minor bug in the logic which will be fixed very soon. We will be putting the Buy Now price on hold (not show it online or making it reflect the bidding price) UNTIL the payment is received. This will allow other potential bidders to place their bids. Once the payment is received the auction will end (which is does now).

Getting kicked off twitter is going to be his least concern I believe!

igot.com worked for me for a while.
They've recently had few delays issue, check if they've fixed that before proceeding.

In an effort to save users time and money, Bitify is pleased to announce the roll out of two great new features and a new fee structure.
Instant Delivery! Deliver/Receive Gift Cards, Keys, and Accounts Instantly
Bitify is excited to introduce a feature many of our users have been eagerly waiting for… Instant Delivery! With Instant Delivery sellers are able to bulk upload gift card codes, accounts, product keys, etc when listing items, which are then delivered instantly to buyers by email when they purchase. This not only reduces the effort for sellers, but greatly reduces the delivery time for buyers too, adding a new level of convenience all round. Sellers are able to see which codes were delivered with each sale in “Sold Items”, as well view/edit the remaining stock. Buyers receive their codes instantly by email as soon as their funds are confirmed, and can also view them through their “Won Items”.
When sellers list an item they will have the option to select Instant Delivery. From their they can either upload a CSV file with the codes/pins or manually enter the codes/account/keys. When you enter the codes, you need to separate them with a comma. Sellers can upload as many codes as they wish, the buyer will receive the number of codes purchased from the seller. The sold codes will be depleted from the quantity remaining and will not be sent to another buyer again.
Super Sellers! Yes, Quicker Escrow Release
Bitify appreciates the support our users have shown over the years and we are awarding sellers who have received over 100 positive feedback reviews* with a new account level, Super Seller! Super Sellers will enjoy automatic escrow releases in 10 days rather than the usual 30 days, will benefit from a reduced 2.5% fee on all sales, and have the ability to list buy-now items with “No End Date”. *Sellers must have made 100 sales in the past 12 months, have at least 100 feedback reviews, and have achieved at least 90% positive feedback. If you meet this criteria, your account will automatically be converted to Super Seller and you will receive an email from us notifying you of the change.
New Fee System! Fairer &amp; Better Value for Money
With the recent surge in Bitcoin price, we understand that it is no longer fare for us to expect our sellers and buyers to pay a 0.001 BTC minimum fee. From today we are completely removing the minimum seller fee on sold items, allowing you to sell low-value items without getting stung with high fees. To accommodate this, we are increasing the fee on sold items from 2.5% to 4.5%, with Super Sellers continuing to pay 2.5%. Overall this will result in savings in seller fees on all items below ~$70 (based on Bitcoin price of $1750).
Our escrow fees are also changing. From now on escrow fees will be a fixed at $0.50 on items under $10, $1 on items between $10-$20, and then calculated at 2.5% (min $1.50) on items over $20. Whilst overall our escrow fee % is increasing, these changes will actually represent a saving in fees on items below $35, with over 70% saved on $10 items (our most popular selling price).
Featured fees will follow the same price scale as escrow fees, fixed at $0.50 on items under $10, $1 on items between $10-$20, and then calculated at 2.5% (min $1.50) on items over $20. Again this will represent a saving on items below $70 compared with the current minimum fee.
Network fees are going to continue to be based on the average fee needed to have your transactions confirm within 5 blocks. This is charged to sellers receiving payouts from us and buyers receiving refunds. For the short-term this is an unavoidable charge, but Bitify is working to improve the situation. We are currently reviewing a number of solutions to reduce the network fees that you pay, such as letting you choose the urgency/fee for the transaction, grouping multiple payments to individual sellers, virtual wallets for buyers and sellers, and delayed/batched transactions. We will keep you posted on our progress!

I'm aware. I mean why would someone register [this]( and redirect it to Bitcoin.org?

bitify.com is proud to host Dorian Nakamoto fundraiser, for an original artwork by cryptograffiti
The artwork was featured in an article about Mr Nakamoto in [Bitcoin Magazine]( covering the inside story of how the hunt for Satoshi Nakamoto turned Dorian’s life upside down.  Created by pseudonymous artist and Bitcoin enthusiast cryptograffiti, the artwork features Mr. Nakamoto’s face made from pieces of destroyed credit cards including the signature strip of Mr Nakamoto’s own card. High resolution images of the artwork can be viewed below.
[The auction]( is being held by cryptograffiti, a friend of Mr Nakamoto,  in order to help him to pay for medical bills and treatment.   The auction will run for around 20 days, finishing on Thursday Nov 12 at 01:00 UTC (Wednesday Nov 11 at 19:00 PDT), and 100% of the final bid amount will go to Mr Nakamoto.
The artist, cryptograffiti, was asked by potential bidders for the auction to be made open instead of the original sealed bit format, hence his decision to use bitify’s platform to host the auction.
You can find out more about Dorian Nakamoto through the AMA he [hosted on Reddit]( earlier this month where you may also ask questions regarding this auction.

About the artist:
cryptograffiti’s work explores the benefits of cryptocurrencies vs. the status quo and the possibilities of blending the digital blockchain with physical art. Much like bitcoin itself, he is pseudonymous.
cryptograffiti is the first artist to utilize a public-facing bitcoin address to receive donations for street art. Upon discovering his work, passersby send bitcoin in support of his often controversial messages.
cryptograffiti’s fine art mediums are frequently comprised of tangible materials from industries being disrupted by cryptocurrencies. His work has been featured in The Wall Street Journal, Bitcoin Magazine, the Montreal Bitcoin Embassy and can be found in the collections of numerous prominent figures within the Bitcoin community.
cryptograffiti is excited at how bitcoin will transform the art world and to play a role in leading this new direction.

When cryptograffiti contacted us about hosting his fund raising auction on bitify, we were excited and more than happy to be involved.  The auction ran for just over 20 days and drew considerable interest from the community from the moment it went live.  Social networks and news sites have been buzzing about the event for several weeks, although the bidding didn’t pick up until the final 3 days – the  last twelve hours saw bids rally from $2,555.55 to a massive $5,501 USD by the time it ended.
The auction drew bids from some big names in the crypto community, their identitiesbeing kept anonymous for privacy reasons of course, but they know who they are and we are extremely happy they joined the bidding war and tried our service.  While we would like to send a massive thank you and congratulations to the winner of the auction, we would also like to keep their identity anonymous and will leave it up to them and/or cryptograffiti to announce it.
The team at bitify.com would like to thank everyone who took part and for making this more successful than we could have hoped.   We are very grateful to those who shared links to the auction, to the media sites that covered the story of cryptograffiti and Mr. Nakamoto, and of course to all the generous bidders.
Until next time, happy Bitcoining!
