It's not that kind of bank. This is the equivalent of the Federal Reserve in the US. It's not a retail bank.

What's the actual problem with this. Let's say if the plan is simply to replace GBP infrastructure with blockchain and centrally issued crypto, wouldn't that be better than the existing GBP? Sure it's still centralised, so doesn't have the romance of BTC, but simply as an improvement on what we have, isn't this a good thing?

Value the gift as at date received. Then CGT on the difference between that value and your ultimate cash-out (fiat) price when selling everything. If you cash out part of it, then pro-rate the original value appropriately. 
Incidentally your concept of gift may be different from HMRC's... The way you described it, it sounds like work for which you were paid and therefore income taxable. 
I am not an accountant, but am fairly confident in assessment on the CGT bit. 
Good luck.

Which country are you in? They have different options depending on your location. I'm not aware of coinbase ever asking you to provide your online banking login details.

But it would have a huge impact because not everyone would bother to jump into tor, right?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:28:01
Haha, good answer

Why do you say that?

If the usb stick (containing the only copy of the keys) physically changed hands, then there will be no txn on the Blockchain. Their exchange would have been entirely based on trust, which is pretty stupid.
Therefore zero way to prove that it did or not change hands. The only things that can be proven: party A acquired coins in the past and party B now has control of said coins. You can't prove that this is not the case.

I've never heard of this. Is this for real?

We had 20k before without an ETF. So why not possible again? Fomo is one helluva drug once there's a rally

For every one sold, one is bought. So, what's your point?
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:10:24
The people looking forward to it hitting $250k. 
If no one's buying at 100k then no one's selling at 100k dude.

Definitely bitcoin will be 100k before Bixby becomes good

Do you have a source for that? Interested to learn and compare with other jurisdictions. Thanks
