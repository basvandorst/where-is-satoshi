The blockchain forking scared me and I thought bitcoin might be dead (I had only just bought in a month earlier).
However, the swift response of the community and quick solution convinced me that the underlying infrastructure and protocol was sound.
From that point, I have been very bullish and just held through each crash.
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:48:48
Yeah, it's mind boggling how much people had at the exchange.  I'm so glad I made the evolution of Gox ---&gt; Blockchain.info ---&gt; Own wallet within a month of first buying Bitcoin.

Yes, I remember my first "crash" back in March 2013 when the blockchain forked.
I must admit I panic sold but got quickly back in as realised I was being foolish.
I think that experience helped me weather future "crashes".

What % of your BTC do you invest in JD?
How trustworthy is it?  What's to stop the creator from just taking everyone's BTC one day?
I have a small amounted invested in JD but reluctant to put more in due to the trust issues.

No they don't.  They have sold options for 10k but they may sell other options at other strike prices.  The premiums will be different for each.
In all likelihood, these would be covered calls they are selling, so they will be hedged and they won't lose money.

Maybe it's worth cashing out in tranches.
Take out your initial investment now and then take out 10% every time the price doubles (or pick 1.5x or whatever).
That way, you won't lose anything and you also have significant coins for the future where hopefully you won't need to "cash out" so to speak but use instead.

You are fine with SI prefixes, as am I.  The point is that it may harm widespread adoption if other people find them confusing.
People need things to be simple, and are not used to using fractions of currency (beyond cents/pence etc.)

I'm ashamed to say I panicked a bit and bailed at $37.  I had bought in at an average of $25 so was still up.
Soon saw the errors of my ways so bought back in at $39 with a view to hold now.
still, lost about 8% of my BTC, selling around 37 and buying back at 39 :(

The US is pretty much the only country that taxes its citizens on a worldwide basis.  Even if you earn money overseas, you still have to pay tax on it.
Countries such as the UK only tax you if you derive your earnings in the UK.  If you earn your money overseas, you are only subject to the tax in the jurisdiction you derive your income.
