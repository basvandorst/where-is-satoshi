Clearly the name is confusing. It should be shortened to Bcoin.

Interesting, but I don't understand how this works. Do these websites have to install an API like OpenID or do you save a regular username and password into the BitShares blockchain?

Some developers are promising too much.
Others are promising too little and fetishizing the idea that security must be expensive.

You're assuming that the users and the developers are on the same side. That will usually be the case in a healthy community, and it may be true for SegWit, but I wouldn't bet on it when it comes to other scaling solutions.

Actually, the correct plural would be Binkleboi in Greek, or Vinklevotes in Latin.

Do we really need another centralized exchange? 
Well, at least the twins have deep pockets, so they won't get broke when they get hacked.

That's a beautiful principle, but people are not free to start a bank, or free to live without a bank account. For example, there are only a handful of banks in the Netherlands, and none of them likes to accept legal sex- or drugs-related businesses. Bitcoiners are tolerated... for now.

~~No, it's a one-way broadcast, so the more people receive Blockstream Satellite, the more centralized the system becomes.~~
Sorry, I misread that. More people running a teleport station would be good for decentralization.

That's why these two funds aren't index funds.
@_date: 2016-12-24 18:59:10
Picking investments based on your own judgment is exactly the opposite of an index fund, which follows an index, as the name 'index fund' subtly suggests. In the case of the research you referred to, they bought the top 10 or top 20 altcoins in market cap - a buying high and selling low strategy in a volatile market.

As if the troll army that created the Antbleed campaign isn't being political!

As an altcoiner who doesn't support BU, I wish the Bitcoin community would agree to the same compromise as Litecoin. Oh wait, that was the Hong Kong agreement, and Core didn't make an honest effort to honor it. Now they try to get their way by slandering Bitmain without any proof of malice.
Creating a website, logo, Twitter account and a trolling campaign for a bug that was simply a failed service for Bitmain customers - is that how members of an open-source software community should communicate with each other?
Jihan Wu has reacted calmly like an adult to petulant children screaming that they hate him, while they don't want to leave the house. If you don't want miners to have any power, why don't you switch to proof of stake?

You could argue that the most important part of Android is 27 years old (Linux)~~, 35 years old (GNU) or more than 45 years old (Unix).~~

That's what the article claims:


But I doubt it. A campaign like this could easily be defined as public education to make people aware of risks - overstated for effect, like any advertising. It's not really different from people here warning against shitcoins, or a number of warnings about high prices by Vitalik.
If a central bank seriously started to campaign against crypto, it would do more than paying $30K for a video. It would instruct banks to refuse crypto-related companies and transactions.
In general, propaganda is a subjective term. Which law would make it illegal? The most contentious examples of government propaganda I've seen in the Netherlands, like a city council publishing its own local newspaper, violated democratic norms rather than laws. And democracies have never been reluctant to create propaganda in wartime.

Very little. I was talking out of my ass there.

A ten-year old should be able to juggle and play a musical instrument. And we could count [BitListen]( as an example of both.
At the ten-year anniversary of the whitepaper, I said we should stop using 'early days' as an excuse for a bad user experience, but [nobody agreed](

Sort of, but [more like this](

Free transactions already exist on Steem and other Graphene blockchains. Creating an account does require paying a fee, but Steemit, the company developing Steem, currently pays that for new users. Because Steem is used for blogging on the blockchain, the transaction volume is already higher than Bitcoin's, and there's plenty of room for growth.
IOTA's not working at the moment, because they're updating the secret Coordinator code...

Yes, they had to delete the 'adult services' section, but that doesn't mean nobody's offering sex for money on Craigslist.

This is complete bullshit. It's not just that you don't have any proof; we have proof of the opposite. Backpage systematically turned details from ads offering underage prostitutes over to the police. That's actually what got them into trouble.

If you're so worried about attacks by state actors, you should immediately stop using bitcoin and start using an anonymous cryptocurrency.

You don't need to map words to all possible addresses. It's more practical to let users link a name to a particular address on the blockchain, or through a DNS-based service like OpenAlias.

Note that the 'Community Guru' is just a [freelance translator]( that spams the forum because she has too much free time on her hands. I don't think anybody in that thread represents Upwork.

No, Matt Bors is the comic editor of The Nib, but that other comic was by Jonathan Rosenberg, who also publishes the SF webcomic [Scenes from a Multiverse](

Let's not pretend there was anything holy about Alfred Nobel. He invented dynamite and later felt guilty about selling explosives used in munitions. It's the big money that made the Nobel prizes prestigious, and the Swedish central bank's money is just as good (although Satoshi doesn't need it, of course).
@_date: 2015-10-11 01:27:51
Why not? In my experience, Upwork has been quite open about its margin, unlike the translation agencies I work for.

I think you're referring to an inefficient timestamping service. Probably incompetence rather than malice.

I agree, there's nothing wrong with creating an altcoin.

When the 21 millionth coin is mined, nobody will use Bitcoin anymore. Except the type of hipsters that use mechanical typewriters today.
