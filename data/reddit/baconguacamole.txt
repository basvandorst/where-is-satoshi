Awesome work!
I compiled all the icons in a font (like font awesome does).
Enjoy :)

Would be nice if you could also provide a proof that you actually own the server you are listing.
You could easily list some nodes available on the network that you actually do not own.
Maybe having each server/ip responding to an HTTP api call in a specific way? Like:




Other than that, I think it's really a very interesting project. How scalable are you right now? If someone send you $20,000 are you able to pop 1,000 node easily?
Keep up the good work!

In a way, I like that. The very fact that starting a lot of node is difficult and expensive means that it's difficult for someone to invade the network with thousands of malicious nodes.
So... it's actually good news ;)

Every time you plug an USB key to transfer the signed transaction from your offline terminal to the online one, Armory save your private key to the USB key and then get it back when you plug the USB key back on the online terminal. After that Armory send the private key to their server where it's store in their database. When the amount of bitcoins they control reach a certain threshold they will steal the bitcoins.
Oh! Armory is not doing that? Please explain how you know that without reading the source code and building from the source...
Believe me, you ARE trusting Armory. Maybe less than if it was an online wallet, but still...

"Whole Foods eGift Cards are available from $5 to $500."
Wait... you can actually buy something for $5 at Whole Foods?

Interesting... I think I've seen this feature in another app (but it was a paid feature).
Thanks for the input!

So, would you say that you're more interested in seeing your last 5 purchases listed on the app main screen rather than a bitcoin price chart?
Or is it more an additional feature somewhere in another page of the app?
Or are you actually thinking of an entire app with for sole purpose to bookkeep your bitcoin purchase (and as a result have the live price displayed somewhere since it needs it).
Thanks for the input!

Couple questions related to fees:
* Who pays the transaction fee when cashing out? You or the end user?
* Do you track those fees? On average, what percentage of the transactions does it account for?
And some more questions :)
* Do you have more statistical data? Like the average amount claimed per user, number of unique address you sent bitcoin too, largest amount of bitcoin sent to one address by the faucet, ...
* Have you detected some bots trying to drain your faucet? If so, what kind of countermeasures have you deployed?
Feel free to only answer part of those questions if your not confortable with some :)
