Makes sense. Thanks for the education .
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:30:19
Agreed. Only it would possibly be millions every day. Think every paycheck over 2k, every plane ticket. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:51:03
Yeah, fees. Realized that after posting. Guess I'll just... Hodl for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:02:58
Agreed. There's gotta be an efficient way to skip the third party handler. Isn't that at least part of what this is all about? EDIT: I'm not a coder, but for this type of transaction, bar tab, how hard would it be to create An app that grabs current prices, interfaces with local wallets, creates a unique receiving address for the transaction on the wallet, and buyer and seller do it directly?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:21:46
Or *.dat

Yeah but if they close the account, they'll lose all that interest. Oh... Wait...

Just use one of the sites like Zillow. Cheap properties are all in the countryside. Knock 20% off whatever the price says on Zillow or Redfin or whatever those sites are.

Damn! Dig the wheels on that monster. Well done!

I did sort of figure that out, but I was always earning too much money while in the US to qualify for health care. So, because I had a job, I couldn't afford health care. My plan now is, if I ever end up back in the US, it will be without a job. I'll be sure to have little if any income and be poor on paper. The middle class gets totally screwed in the US, which is why we either leave or die out.
EDIT: The 'health insurance' I got with my job was a joke. It didn't kick in until I'd spent 20K or something. Laughable.

That sounds pretty sweet. What can a gringo get a modest house for in Mexico, I mean someplace one would actually want to live. I have no idea. 100K? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:30:00
Not necessarily. There are lots and lots of cheap houses in FL that have been on the market many months.

Well that pretty much describes our life for the last couple of decades, small kitchen, tight budget, not eating out. We don't like to eat out, unless it's mom and pop places. We have only lived in the US for maybe 4 of the last 28 years, and it's never worked out. We're currently back in Asia, but we were looking into Mexico last time we were living in the US. Every time we live in the US, we feel really vulnerable. One illness, one lawsuit (I mean, what if someone slips on our steps?), and we're on the street. It's stupid. Americans who have never lived anywhere else, many of them, think the health care system is just dandy. In my opinion, it's the biggest problem the US is facing.
Then there are the guns, of course. I like shooting guns. I'm not a total anti-gun person. But when we were living in the US last, in the country, I heard gunfire EVERY FUCKING DAY. I'm not exaggerating. And it was from all directions. And this wasn't hunting. This was often automatic gunfire. Just people shooting for the hell of it. I heard a round go through our trees one afternoon. Fucking insane. What do people get out of that? 
So, yeah, I agree with all your points.
We're frugal as hell. It's surprising on how little one can live when the government doesn't take it all. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:59:39
Nope. At the moment I don't want to sell anything. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:19:52
Thanks for that. It gives me hope. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 07:57:41
And you're paying how much rent now? 
@_date: 2018-08-18 08:24:14
I like your style...
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:27:18
Pretty sure you o,ly need two or three.
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:55:49
Yeah, might be the earliest to hope for a sighting. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:13:18
Indeed it is. It will probably be years. That's fine. I'll wait. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 20:40:32
I'll do that by spending rather than trading. I just wish booking.com and airlines took crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:20:33
Travel much?
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:53:42
Absolutely. In fact I hope to use all my Bitcoin to pay for everything from travel to wine. It's the best way to avoid capital gains taxes. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:57:30
No, he's just matured, like the difference between blowing your wad in 90 seconds when you first had sex compared to learning how to, you know, really get it up and keep it up. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:19:13
But where will you get your paper money when the ATM's don't work?
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:14:00
No, it's a very healthy heartbeat as opposed to a wildly irregular one.
