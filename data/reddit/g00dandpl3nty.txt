No, actually using private tools is simply a gigantic blow horn alerting foreign governments that you are a spy.

Capitalism isn't printing money. That's just having a central bank, which every country has. Capitalism is the ability to buy and sell goods freely without interference from the government. I lived in Venezuela, and free exchange of goods and services is severely hampered by the government which continually bashes calitalism. This is a failure of extreme authoritarianism and the countries anti free market ideals.

As Vitalik mentioned once, the probability that the arbitrarily chosen value of 1MB is the optimal block size is low. Its important to keep the block size in check, but we should also consider that there are major problems with keeping it *too small*.

Eh, 140MB isn't that big for 10 minute block times. A full gigabit connection can download 125MB a second. The solution to the problem is making nodes profitable by incentivizing them the same way miners are incentivized, not limiting the block size in order to keep the network run by volunteers. Thats just not gonna fly, there needs to be a financial incentive to run a node.

Actually, trades are non zero sum games in economic theory. The buyer and seller only complete a transaction if they each value what the other has more than what they have. I buy that tasty taco because I value it at that moment more than the money it costs me. The taco stand values my money more than the taco, thus we both benefit more than if the trade had never occurred. This is why trade is generally good for economies. One country has excess X, the other has excess Y, and both benefit by trading them, hence its a win win.

Bitcoin doesn't have any *intrinsic value* because there is fundamentally no such thing. Value is not intrinsic in anything, it varies for all things based upon supply and demand of that thing. 
Value isnt intrinsic because it can always go to zero for anything. Value can go to zero in two ways: Either when demand goes to zero, or supply goes to infinity (for all practical purposes).
Air has no value despite high demand, because supply is so much greater. The turds I just plopped into the toilet have no value because demand for them is sadly zero, despite there being a relatively small supply of G00dAndPl3nty turds in the world.

Use Coinbase both to buy and store your Bitcoin. An exchange is significantly more complicated for buying, and keeping your own private keys safely in a wallet you control is a rabit hole that never ends. 
If you're not an uber Bitcoin guru, then you're far more likely to screw the whole thing up and lose your Bitcoin. Yes, there is a risk that Coinbase could get hacked or steal your coins (though they are insured), but that risk is far less than a newby losing their coins on their own in my opinion.
Despite what everybody in here says, the simplest and most secure way for a regular person to safely store bitcoin is to have an expert do it for you.

Not this again. Nothing has intrinsic value. Nothing. Value is a creation of the human mind as a result of supply and demand. The value of everything can go to zero via either a lack of demand, or and abundance of supply. There is nothing in the laws of physics that says something must be valuable to humans.

You're dead wrong. The volatility doesn't matter because most people who use bitcoin for transactions, use it as a transaction layer. When I send money to my Venezuelan friends, dollars are converted to bitcoin, bitcoin is sent to Venezuela, and immediately exchanged for Bolivars. This is how Bitcoin payment processors work. You are not exposed to Bitcoin volatility.
If you honestly think that doing international transactions without middle men, almost instantly, without risk of fraud, without banks, without any governments permission, and with negligible fees has absolutely no value then you're in complete denial.

Gold's industrial uses account for far less than 1% of its value. The vast majority of the world's gold is sitting in vaults completely unused. Besides, the fact that gold has industrial uses doesn't mean it has intrinsic value. If a giant pure gold meteor crashed into earth, providing so much gold that it became a nuisance, the value of gold would plummet to zero or near zero, despite the fact that you seem to believe that there is some physical law that states Gold must be valuable to humans.
All value is created as a result of finite supply and positive demand. There is absolutely nothing intrinsic about it

Bitcoin isnt a currency, probably never will be, and doesn't need to be. Its a commodity, like Gold, and the reason its so successful is because it doesn't encourage you to get rid of it like a currency does. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:55:16
You just admitted that Gold has no "intrinsic" value, because its price could plummet under certain scenarios. That is the literal exact opposite of the meaning of the word "intrinsic". What people mean when they say "intrinsic value" is utilitarian value, and you are correct that Gold does indeed have utilitarian value due to many of its excellent physical properties. You are wrong however to think that Bitcoin has no utilitarian value. Bitcoin is the absolute best way to send money to Venezuela, as it completely bypasses the artificially low exchange rates mandated by the Venezuelan government. I am literally feeding families I know from when I used to live there with Bitcoin. There are a myriad of uses for Bitcoin outside of speculation: Blackmarket purchases, international transfers, any purchase where you don't trust the buyer. For example, lets say you have an online store. Are you going to let the Nigerian prince buy things from your store with a credit or debit card? No. Hell no. The probability of fraud is incredibly high. Not a problem with Bitcoin. All those Craigslist scams? Not a problem with Bitcoin. Identity theft? Not a problem with Bitcoin.
This is the major weakness of the financial system: It depends entirely upon trust. Anybody that cannot be trusted, is therefore excluded. This is why entire countries are excluded from the modern financial system. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a-political. It is not controlled by a government. Funds cannot be frozen, transactions cannot be stopped.
I could go on and on, but Bitcoin has many uses.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:03:50
How is it not a problem? Both BTC and BCH block discovery times are all over the fucking place as miners bounce between the two currencies. That is a problem, and you can't just fix it with a fork. The point here is that the fork has real impacts apart from ideology.

Actually, most people outside the US don't buy coffee with their dollars. They value their dollars much more than their national currency. If you live in the US, then its hard for you to fully understand the appeal of Bitcoin because you reap the benefits of using the worlds reserve currency every day.
The USD wont be a reserve currency forever, simply because it greatly benefits the US to the detriment of the rest of the world. Its not a stable configuration because it isn't economically fair, and eventually this will lead to its replacement.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:43:12
It's not as complicated as people here are making it out to be. Bottom line is that ALL value is derived from limited supply and non-zero demand. WHY there is demand for alt coins is due to a lot of different reasons, but all that matters is that there is demand, and some people want to buy them.

No, the answer is not "complicated math". Its much simpler. Bitcoin is a protocol, and that protocol is empowered by people choosing to use it. Anybody can change the protocol to increase the Bitcoin limit, but remember that the protocol is empowered by people choosing to use it. Most people will simply continue to use the standard Bitcoin protocol, not your mutation of it, and thus your change won't have lasting power unless you can convince enough people it is a good idea.

mandatory time locks are a security feature. A good one actually. If a hacker gains access and tries to steal the coins, he cannot do so immediately, he must wait because of the time lock, and as a result, it is likely that by the time the time lock has expired, the attempt will be discovered and the theft thwarted.
The downside to such a system is that these time locks can interfere with timely withdraws when you run out of bitcoin in your hot wallet.

No its not that simple. Tax hikes and budget cuts only work in a well functioning government. Venezuela is one of the most corrupt in the world. Imagine if Trump dismissed the Supreme court and then stacked it with supporters. Then imagine he did the same to Congress a year later because it was full of democratically elected opposition party members. Thats what Maduro did.
Venezuela is using the money printing press as a way to steal wealth from the populous. Its an indirect tax, and this is how hyper inflation nearly always happens. Not from naturally occuring economic downturns, but from self inflicted economic downturns caused by theft and corruption.
The system is at the mercy of those in power. Blockchains on the other hand have nobody in power to corrupt. It is literally the most incorruptible system ever devised by man.

Lol its clear here that you don't understand anything. You think SHA256 hashing is the pinnacle of consensus algorithms? Bitcoin is already behind in this regard as other algos allow for more decentralisation. There are a plethora of new consensus algos that offer all sorts of goodies, and this is a brand new field.
Bitcoin is behind on fungibility/privacy as well. Monero, Zcash and Dash are lightyears ahead.
Bitcoin is where its at because of its relative stability and first mover advantage. Things like lightning network could be a big upgrade, but you're a fool if you think Bitcoin is the pinnacle of Distributed consensus systems.

There is no competition for customers in the ISP space for the same reason you dont have 20 different water companies hooked up to your house all with their own independent network of pipes: Its too costly and inefficient. Just ask Google who tried to compete with incumbants and threw in the towel because it cost too much FOR THE SECOND RICHEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD. It costs hundreds of billions of dollars to compete in the ISP space because you have to create your own infrastructure. This is why there is no competition.
My last apartment had one ISP available: Comcast, the most hated company in the US. This is the case for the majority of US citizens. 
This is why water, gas and electric companies are granted legal monopoly status in exchange for being regulated. For some situations where standard market forces dont work, its vastly superior.

There is no free market solution for the same reason you dont have 20 different independent water networks connected to your house. Each company that wants to provide water to your house isn't going to create their own entire water pipe network independent of everybody else. The costs to do so are simpky too high.  Same goes for electricity and gas. Instead, these utility companies are regulated as utilities BECAUSE FREE MARKET SOLUTIONS SIMPLY DO NOT WORK EFFICIENTLY IN THESE SCENARIOS. I'm a free market invisible hand guy, but free markets require ample competition to function properly, and inefficiencies inherent to having multiple infrastructure networks simply overwhelms market forces that operate wonderfully in other spaces.
The internet is no different from roads, water, electricity and gas in this regard, and should be treated the same.

You're conveniently ignoring all the shit that ISPs can and will do to the internet without some sort of regulation preventing them from doing so. There is almost ZERO competition in the ISP space so market forces are non existent. Nothing stops them from dividing up the internet into fast and slow lanes, and then charging you more for reasonable access.
I'm sure we can agree that the entire reason why governments are bad is because of the centralization of power, and the abuse that this fosters. We all know this as bitcoiners. 
However, centralized power via corporate monopolies is little different from centralized power via government, and in some cases worse. We can vote for change in government, but it doesn't matter if Comcast is despised more than any company in the US, because most of their users have no viable alternative, and the internet is essential in this day and age.

Bitcoin has survived a half dozen full fledged bubble crashes of significant proportions, and recovered from each one to a higher position than where it started. Tulip Bulbs didn't survive a single crash. Of course Bitcoin is going to crash... again..

Its the most perfect commodity in history as its price is driven entirely by market demand since supply is mathematically restricted and predictable.

The problem is that the ISP space isn't conducive to competition, thats what you fail to realize. There's a reason why most ISPs face little to no competition in the US, have the worst consumer satisfaction of any industry, and internet prices have actually risen in the past few decades. Its called infrastructure, and the massive amounts of it that are required to compete with any other ISP make it nearly impossible. Even GOOGLE with their absurdly deep pockets gave up trying to compete with the established players. Free market forces don't function properly in these kinds of spaces, which is the same as other spaces like utilities.

Its because when you're dealing with super important code, you want as many guarantees as possible that your code is correct and without bugs, and dynamic languages like JavaScript do not have compile time guarantees. 
There are entire classes of bugs that a compiler protects you against. A misspelled variable will happily sit in your production environment code until it gets executed and suddenly everything is broken because your unit tests are not 100% and didn't cover that obscure error handling scenario code that you never expected would get executed anyway.
When your dealing with critical code, a compiler is incredibly useful. Furthermore, as the codebase scales to larger and larger sizes, and more and more developers get involved, simple things like renaming a function or changing a function's signature are more difficult to validate without automatic refactoring tools and such.      
@_date: 2017-04-18 19:25:30
Task runners, linters and parsers do not at all make up for anything I described. Task runners will not have 100% code coverage, and linters/parsers cannot detect most errors that a compiler can. There is a fundamental lack of information in the source code that you just cannot make up for.
Besides, thats a hell of a lot of work to try and get something you get for free with a compiler.

I use bitcoin on a regular basis to help out my Venezuelan friends, but you have to realize that Bitcoin is not a solution to many of their currency problems because of the high miners fee. 50 cents a day is typical earnings over there, and paying that or more as a transfer fee means bitcoin cannot be used for common purchases.
Also, paper wallets cannot be passed around securely like you are suggesting. Fraud is incredibly high there. 
The way that Bitcoin helps Venezuelans is as a store of value for savings, and as a transfer intermediary between dollars and bolivars as you cannot send dollars to Venezuela without it all evaporating to the false exchange rate mandated by the Venezuelan government.
I have setup a system with a Venezuelan friend and we act as intermediaries between Americans trying to send money to their Venezuelan friends. I convert the dollars to Bitcoin, send it to my friend who then immediately sells it on localbitcoins venezuela for bolivars, and transfers the bolivars to the recipient. Obviously we only do this for friends and family. I dont want to go to jail for violating money transmitter laws by helping feed starving Venezuelans.
This is literally the best and fastest way to send money to Venezuela right now because it completely bypasses the false exchange rate between the dollar and the bolivar, so the recipients get the full value of the money sent. Using a bank or other system would result in a tiny fraction of the value being received as the false exchange rate is absurdly high.

That is not true and never was. The bolivar isn't worth as much as the Venezuelan government says it is. Unlike every other country in the world, Venezuela thinks it can mandate a specific exchange price for its currency (10 Bolivars to the dollar) and ignores the real market price (~4700 Bolivars to the dollar). This false exchange rate is one of the main reasons the Venezuelan economy is in a tailspin. The government thinks it can ignore the laws of supply and demand.
If you use the market exchange rate for the Bolivar, you see that Bitcoin is worth about what it should be

Its not a fee, its a false exchange rate. If you send money to Mexico, yes you'll pay a fee, but at least you'll exchange your dollars for the market exchange rate of pesos. That is not the case with exchanging dollars for bolivars. You dont get the market exchange rate of 4500 bolivars to the dollar, you get a government fixed exchange rate of 10 bolivars to the dollar.

A mispelled variable is one example that I never said a linter cannot catch (even then not all mispellings can be caught). There are a plethora of entire classes of bugs that linters cannot catch that compilers can. That is simply a fact. There is simply not enough information imbedded in the source code to validate it at that level.
Im not saying JS doesn't have its place, Im just saying that when you're writing mission critical code, you want your code as verifiable as possible, and dynamic languages are fundamentally at a disadvantage here. NASA has never and will never use a dynamic language. Google developed DART to deal with this, Microsoft developed TypeScript to deal with this, and Facebook created Typed PHP to deal with this. Furthermore, when Facebook migrated their code base to typed PHP, and ran the compiler for the first time, it shitted out a plethora of bugs that had been latent on their code base for years.
There's no point trying to get humans to do validation when programs can do it much better and much quicker.

ES code cannot be verified like Typescript, or other static languages can. Most of the time this isn't a big deal because javascript is pretty agile, but when the cost of a bug can be very high, it becomes worth the extra time and effort to have as much code validation as possible

You were literally just proclaiming the virtues golds finite supply, and now you're trying to argue that it would be good if that supply dramatically increased. Pick one argument, you cant have both because they are contradictory. 
Precious metals are inferior in every way that matters compared to cryptos, but the truth is that it doesn't matter what I think, or what you think. All that matters is what the upcoming generations think, and here is why: 
Gold is old, analog, and completely incompatible with the modern economy. Cryptos on the other hand are digital natives, and interact seamlessly in a way thay has never been accomplished before. You're an old man trying to tell me that email is just a fad, and that snail mail will continue to be the preferred way to communicate.
You may not understand why people prefer Bitcoin, but younger generations will decide the fate of Gold and Cryptos, and for the young, digital is king.

If they were smart, the mining algorithm can work with useful data, like existing torrent data. For example, the algo picks a random torrent block hash (with a salt) of a random torrent, and queries the network to determine how many of the miners can prove that they have that torrent block by producing the correct hash (using the provided salt so they cant just keep a database of the hashes). You can only produce this salted hash if you posess the torrent block. Mining rewards are given to all those in the network that can produce the salted hash. 
The challenge lies in determining which torrent block is randomly chosen as the next puzzle.

Thats a nonsensical argument. There are also infinitely many internet protocols that can be created, and yet we use only one for nearly everything because of Metcalfs law and the Network effect. 
The fact that you can create infinite versions and variations of an idea doesn't mean that there will be dillution of its value, because people converge on a relatively small number of them.
As an example.. I just created a thousand new social networking websites called Facebook2 through Facebook1001 that are identical in features to the original Facebook. Do my copies of the original dillute its value? No, because the value of the network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users, not to the number of copies or variations of the network that exist. This is Metcalfs law.  My facebook versions have no users except for me and my mother, who was so kind to support me in my dreams of making a thousand facebook clones.

Sharding can scale on layer one, which is what ETH is working on. Layer 2 is the only way to scale to be able to do things like real time metering and such however. In an ideal world, crypto layer 1 is sufficient to handle all daily transactional needs of the entire planet (15 billion max), while layer 2 is used for devices and other things that need low latency and massive throughput.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:52:17
Thanks for the Peter Todd link. I highly respect that guy. The problem as I see it is this: Sharding is hard, maybe impossible? But you know what? So was creating a distributed ledger until Bitcoin came around and did it. Maybe Ethereum fails trying to do it, maybe a few other coins also fail, but guess what, one of these days somebody is going to succeed because there are hoards of really really smart people out there trying to solve this problem, and I suspect somebody will do it sooner than you think. 
I see it as inevitable that somebody is eventually going to create a coin that scales *on chain* to meet the daily needs of the entire planet, has zero or near zero fee's, is untraceable, is secure as theoretically possible from sybil attacks and collusion attacks, and has full smart contract functionality. Once this super coin is created, it will likely reign supreme for a really long time as further advances in tech provide diminishing usability returns as most people's needs are met, and network effects become insurmountable. 
The greatest threat to Bitcoin isn't banks or governments or exchanges. It is superior technology that makes it obsolete, and my concern is that Bitcoin is simply too conservative to fight off the hundreds of coins with advancing tech that seem far more likely to become this supercoin than Bitcoin.

I understand perfectly how to secure my own bitcoins. My point is that most people do not, and will not. You cannot eliminate risk, you can only choose the least risky option *considering the circumstances*.
You are correct that the least risky method is probably being educated and storing your own bitcoin properly, but *most people do not qualify for the best method*. The best method becomes the worst method if you don't know shit about bitcoin because the probability of losing your bitcoin due to ignorance is quite high. In this case, the worst method (trusted third party) becomes the best method for practical purposes. 
I gave my brother $50 in bitcoin which he promptly stored in mycellium wallet on his phone. He quickly forgot about it and lost his phone and forgot his password. Bitcoin is lost. My mother also has Bitcoin stored on Coinbase. She also forgot about it, and doesn't know her password but it doesn't matter because I can still access it. Bitcoin not lost.

Bitcoin is a shitty currency, and that is precisely why it is so valuable and desired. Modern currencies are inflationary by nature so as to encourage you to exchange it for goods and services.

The negatives of non reversible transfers are mitigated by something called multisig transactions, where you can optionally have an independent overseer act as an arbiter of the transaction. The transaction stays limbo until 2 of 3 people decide its fate (or any combination M of N). If buyer and seller both agree, transaction goes through. If buyer and seller disagree, arbiter chooses if the transaction is cancelled or proceeds. The cool thing about this is that the arbiter doesn't hold the funds and cannot squander them. They can only vote as to whether the transaction proceeds or is cancelled if there is a dispute. 
This lets people buy and sell goods with some level of assurances in a non reversible transactional system.

More people voted for Hillary than Trump, so they weren't entirely wrong. Either way, last election had two of the shittiest presidential candidates the US has ever seen, so we were fucked either way.

More people voted for her in the US, period. She was more popular. Thats what POPULAR VOTE means, and you can't dance around that fact. The vast majority if the US population lives in those "elitest" areas you so easily dismiss as irrelevant.
Im just stating objective facts here. I didnt vote for her. 
You said the polls were wrong, and that is false. The polls were accurate, and now you're changing the subject to avoid this fact.

No.. she was more popular in the entire country, which is why she won the popular vote. Polls measure popularity, not electoral college results. The polls were accurate. The interpretation of the poll results was not.

The data is very clear on this issue. 
I have data, you have nothing
