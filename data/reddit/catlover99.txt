Can't wait for our privately funded sidewalks, I'm getting tired of avoiding public sidewalks because they were paid for by teft. And I'm tired of all these people thinking food is more important than building your own startup simply because of some bullshit excuse like they were born into poverty or something.

You could offer services such as helping other businesses setup and manage models for accepting bitcoin. One of the largest issues is how difficult it is for companies to setup the ability to accept bitcoin, there are some out there that just need a little assistance. 
Kind of like a cable repair guy/plumber, they can call you up and ask to have it installed or help fixing problems with their equipment. Sell the service part too, and sell it hard.

Don't most credit card companies freeze your account without asking you if they think something is wrong? I know I've had this happen to me a few times in the past, it's never really been a problem.
Don't get me wrong this situation was responded to poorly but no action of real harm was done. If you are high frequency trading bitcoins you probably shouldn't be doing it on a site that isn't even built for it, so that's a weak excuse to support your argument.

On your website, don't use that large space at the top of the page for that logo, the logo would be better placed in the left corner header section (and it would look better a lot smaller), you can use that new space to have scrolling information (slider) like you see on many modern web pages 
Also for help designing and building your site you can source the bitcoin community e.g.

Has anyone even taken a look at this thing? There are no screenshots, readme, or documentation.
 
I'm trying my best, but this github has no readme and his code has virtually no comments. So far I've had to go from the main.py and trace my way through trying to figure out how it operates.
Nothing tells you that you have to change the config.py in order to direct the script to the blockchain, instead there is a comment in the main next to a variable declration that refrences the config class, which if you don't change you will get an ambigous error.
    main.py
     python
    data_dir = config.path 'blocks')
Why the programmer would comment out that snippet of code inside of the main is beyond me, and you have to go to config.py and change the path from path = '' to the commented piece of code
     python
    
    addresses = ['1FAvch92vioLKene4iu6wEjsPWdm67nGJK', '16mvEuRpiDSLM7febL4okhosNSz2ybRWfM']
    days = 30
    path = ''
to path = os.path.join(os.getenv('APPDATA'),'Bitcoin', 'blocks')
His english (or grammar comprehension level) is atrocious, even in his code there are grammar and spelling mistakes:
**tl;dr: so far this entire program is poorly written/documented hype based tomfoolery with a vm that inexplicitly runs on a no longer supported version of windows**
okay after looking through it, you need to run bitmessagemain.py to start the program. The only downside is that it hangs immediately after starting.

and thus the term responsible disclosure went in one ear and out the other
finding an exploit and not knowing what to do next except pointing it out to the world to say "hey guys, check this out I literally just found it" is embarrassing to yourself and to the service
It's obvious op is looking for some kind of praise and his method is sloppy/childish
He didn't even try to explore the threat further and instead jumps straight into belittling another person for a human error, would have a field day out of this attention seeker

How would I go about starting a donation campaign to raise some money to give to drug rehab clinics and the homeless, are there sites dedicated to that kind of thing? I want to help out my community and use bitcoin to do it. I live in the triangle (Raleigh NC) are and not many people know what bitcoin is here despite being a very technology focused area. 
Is there a subreddit/site for crowdsourcing with btc?

Jury nullification was one of the first things that came to my mind involving this case because it seems so blatantly obvious that the charge of drug kingpin isn't being used in its proper context and is instead trying to compensate for charges that are not specific or broad enough to easily   convict Ross.
The fact that so few people know about their right to jury nullification is one of the stranger parts of the justice system especially in the sense that most courts actively keep that information away from the jury. This video does a great job explaining it

Reading the transcripts it seems that although Judge Forrest's decisions at times seem to be directed at hindering Dratel's efforts she actually provides sound reasoning for her decisions. When she eviscerated the defense’s evidence that Karpeles was a suspect I was a little surprised that they would simply remove such, what seemed to be at the time, important information. She explained that it was removed because Karpeles suspected involvement was based mostly on Special Agent Der-Yarvasomething's 'hunches'. There was no solid evidence other than the SA's speculation and it would not be fair to use it in the trail just like how it wouldn't be fair to indict somebody simply because a detective is suspicious of them and that fair treatment is especially important when trying to claim that a specific person is actually the perpetrator, the evidence has to be solid.
 Despite that I can definitely pick up a sense of Judge Forrest being more lenient towards the prosecution while jumping at the chance to correct Dratel along with not being as willing to accept an objection from him.

Having read the transcripts I do feel a lot of sympathy for the guy too. It seems like he had dreams for it become big but didn't actually expect it grow so rapidly. His journal entries are almost haunting in that they seem so innocent and so normal, he'll be writing about his friends or events of that day and then casually slip in something about Silk Road here and there.
Part of what makes it so easy to feel sympathy for him is that his life contains essentially all the elements of a shakespeare tragedy
The fatal flaw - all of the heroes in Shakespeare's tragedies have a weakness in personality that eventually leads to their downfall. Ross had several of these which included his need to share his secret life with the people he cares about and having too much ambition
Fall of the nobleman - many of the men in Shakespeare's tragedies have extreme wealth and power, making their downfall more tragic. Ross had a seemingly very normal life with lots of friends and a mother that really really cared about him. He was by all accounts a very kind and caring person. Now I'm not sure if his mother can even look at him.
External pressure - Shakespeare's tragic heroes often fall victim to external pressure from others, such as evil spirits and manipulative characters who play a role in their downfall. Ross came across these people numerous times including Variety James and even some other people who were only in it for the money. His eventual downfall was the result of an undercover Homeland Security agent manipulating him. 
Hero - The hero has opportunities for redemption but never takes advantage of these in time, which leads to death. While he doesn't die he does mention that he does mention in his journal his intent to go off the grid. A few days before his arrest he was interviewed by Homeland Security for having fake passports delivered and that provided a hint that he was no longer safe but didn't take the opportunity to distance himself from the site. 
The protagonist is usually a person of good character who is destroyed by his own ego or desire for self-advancement. This is basically a summary of Ross's current condition, he chased after something because of his ego and desire to be successful and it ultimately destroyed who he was before he started the site.

Based on the transcript the Judge does issue breaks somewhat frequently (about 3 times a day, not including lunch break) but they are very short; typically within the frame of 5-10 minutes, in her words "just enough to stretch our legs". The transcript also makes it more apparent just how boring the case can be at times, lots of legal jargon and tedious construction of events with respect to what seems to be at times needless information.

Out of all the stimulants out there he had to choose cocaine. Nothing wrong with that as far as the analogy is concerned but it does end up creating a filter as to which editors may choose to publish this quote in an article.
