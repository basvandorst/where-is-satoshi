Trustlessness is an amazing technical capability. It is also astronomically expensive and very, very rarely necessary for real use cases we have at the moment. 
I would like to think that some brand new use cases will be found where it is an essential (or very useful) property - but plenty of smart people have now been looking for a good few years - and very few actual new use cases have been found.

The funniest thing is watching butters slowly come to the realisation that "trustless" is actually not a property you want in a financial system, and having independent, trusted third-parties policed by a regulator with the power of criminal sanction is actually necessary for the whole thing to work.
Some of you will soon be following this up with "no, actually fractional (or even fictional) reserve banking is good" when Tether is finally forced to come clean...

Completely fair, except that there's this little thing called "contagion". You may remember that about, ohhh, 10 years ago there was some completely irresponsible yahoos that were playing complex, and (to the layperson) totally un-understandable games with financial instruments. Do we remember how that turned out for the economy as a whole?

Actually, numbnuts, Internet access is very important to many homeless people because it provides a cheap &amp; easy way to access a lot of services &amp; to keep in contact with friends &amp; family. And, y'know, maybe try to rebuild the web of societal contacts which so many homeless people have lost (&amp; which are a major contributory factor to so many people becoming homeless).
Finally, you would have thought that this subreddit would be keen on the idea of digital assests that can't be taken by force. Because the reality is that homeless people face the threat of having their meagre assets taken by force pretty much every day. But that doesn't fit the "They terk our moniez wiv OMG taxez iz theftz" sophomore "libertarian" bullshit narrative. 
So maybe your "ha ha - laugh at the homeless kid" comment is a far more fitting example of the "fuckyouIgotmine" attitude that prevails here.

I'm founding a company to help Bitcoiners detect scams (for a small fee). Would you like to invest in it? It will be regulated and operated out of a British dependency, for safety.

Huge chunks of Africa, outside the larger towns has no mains electricity, no mains water, no network (not even GSM) and rampant illiteracy. How do you expect this to work?
And that's leaving aside the horrendous CO2 emissions that Bitcoin produces, which directly works against the interests &amp; policy of most developing countries. There are grants to help developing nations decarbonise (&amp; stop burning awful shit like kerosene) - but if adopted at scale, Bitcoin would be, far, far worse. 
The really funny part, though, is that the recent runaway success story of mobile payment in Europe is the direct bank-bank via mobile phone systems. Where did they start? M-Pesa in Africa. Moral of the story: start with actual users with real needs and work from there, rather than trying to find a use (any use) for Bitcoin.

The reason why everyone can't be a VC is because they don't have a ton of money and the ability to handle and manage a portfolio risk profile, where virtually all investments fail, and a handful make out like bandits (10X or 100X return) - which pay for the ones that fail. The investors here are flying a kite - after all the eventual probable size of the market when it's actually mature enough to go after (8-10 years is my guess), makes $120M look like chicken feed.

The inconvenient truth is that Bitcoin is defined by trustlessness (&amp; public mining). If you don't need those features, then Bitcoin is not a convenient means of exchange. 
Why is anyone remotely surprised that the only popular use cases of a trustless, pseudonymous exchange medium are of questionable legality at best?

So close, so close to self-awareness.

Not a big deal? Do some fucking research. The Galen Marsh case for retail compliance should do for a start. Then for institutional trading compliance, start with the Nick Leeson case (&amp; read his book). 
Note that in the former case, a few thousand customers data was exposed for &lt;24h as the bank caught it immediately &amp; shut it down, and were in a position to be fully compliant with the regulator, who were very understanding as a result, and *only* fined them $1M as a sanction. 
Compliance is a big fucking deal.

1) I'm fascinated by human folly
2) The antics of people who have the arrogance to believe that they could redesign the financial system whilst knowing so little about how it actually works are fucking hilarious.

Got a link as to how many BTC ATMs there are now, as opposed to 12 months ago? Because in the two cities I spend most time in (London &amp; NYC), I've seen plenty of instances of BTC ATMs being removed / disappearing. I would guess the overall number is going down, not up.
Also, there's that small matter of needing to be regulated. You can't just open a high street "exchange" and not expect a visit from the Serious Fraud Office (or equivalent in appropriate country)

Also note that an increasing number of UK bank accounts will not accept cheques for deposit. A useful fact for anyone conducting UK &lt;-&gt; US business, as a lot of US businesses still seem to want to pay using the stupid bits of paper.

Every bank in the UK has free, instant (the longest I've ever had to wait is &lt;1hr) transfers (same bank &amp; between banks). No limit I've ever experienced (I've sent &gt;£5000) and the transfers are non-reversible. Why would I need bitcoin for anything legal?

The epitome of weasel words. HMRC have said that they'll determine in detail how to treat it when it becomes necessary to do so (i.e. when it's important enough to care about, so never). Their guidance was *if* it was used as a currency, it would be treated as such (so consumers have to pay VAT on all BTC-demoninated transactions and any EU business with turnover above the UK VAT threshold who accepts BTC from UK customers will have to register, account for, and pay UK VAT - in GBP of course). However, if used as an appreciating asset, BTC would be subject to CGT. Now, how are you bagholders using it?

Haven't seen the video yet, but y'all know that the Isle of Man is a creepy tax haven that's like travelling back to the 1970s, right? The Butter companies based there are essentially a tax write-off for the VCs backing them.
@_date: 2016-10-09 06:19:07
Indeed. In fact it's almost as though Bitcoin is such a tiny market that they don't have to give a shit about it one way or another.

I do love Buttcoiners. 
1) The GBP is not solely issued by the BoE, although it is the UK's central bank
2) The UK has no "official" currency, in the sense that "legal tender" does not exist even in theory. However, the UK's debt is denominated in GBP - if that was what you meant (although, from the rest of your comment it's fairly clear that you don't know *what* you meant)
3) Monetarily is one of the few ways in which the UK is still united. You could have gone for "economically", "socially", "politically" or even, arguably, "fiscally" - but as you butters love to say, 1 GBP = 1 GBP &amp; that's as true in Fife as it is in Barking. Even in the event of Scoxit the peg to GBP would be maintained (until ascension back into the EU, when they would, of course, be required to adopt EUR).
Still, you get a 100% butter score - you were wrong on every point about money that you attempted to make.

Not unless the banks have some reason to believe the depositors were negligent, and are prepared to pursue it. 
See kids, that's what happens when you store ActualMoney in a financial institution that understands and quantifies risk &amp; has insurance policies to cover problems like this.

I'm very interested in Bitcoin - but only because I'm a student of human folly. Watching the assorted scams, libertarian nutjobs, Dunning-Kruger muppets and outright criminals is like a 3-ring circus to me.
The tech itself? Well, I'm with Samuel Johnson - "It is not done well, but the surprising thing is that it is done at all." (para.)

The largest programming community for which we have reasonable stats is Java (the Web / Javascript &amp; C/C++ communities are of similar size or larger, but they are very hard to measure) - which has 10M developers. In my experience, &lt;1% of programmers have any interest or skills in bitcoin. So I would guess that the number of "bitcoin developers" is &lt;100k, but probably &gt;20k.

"Spam Prevention" was disproved by one of the Laurie brothers, some time around 2000. The economic analysis works for any Proof-of-Work system, so this use case for Bitcoin was fucked long before it was even invented.
