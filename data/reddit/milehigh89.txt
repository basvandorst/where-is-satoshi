This is a great point, is there a bitcoin roadmap pdf? I would love to see that but am not finding anything through Google. Translating this technology into a future that we can be excited about is paramount to adoption. For instance, one thing I think we'll see is restaraunts in other retail adopting crypto, to skirt high credit card fees, and so they can get their hands on the money faster. right now, it can take a restaurant a few days to acutally receive the money from a sale. This can tie up tens of thousands of dollars easily in just float, and costs a few % of the sale to do so. Crypto offers a way to get them their money in real time, but what are the products being put in place to make this a reality? There are so many brilliant use cases of getting people their money faster without having to go through centralized organizations. Unfortunately, half of the crypto news I read about today is about fucking faketoshi. Bitcoin needs guerilla marketing in the worst way, and unfortunately seems that the tech is being lost in the hype. We are missing the the proverbial forest for the lambos.

Guys I don't even know anymore. Coming off a massive loss on a small-cap biotech I was then down 85% on everything I had left on LTC/ETH/BTC. Literally in shambles in December, questioning everything. Back well in the black, I am in tears guys. My nuts have been on the chopping block so long they've taken root. Today, my big balls have emerged victorious. I am now a vet.
