We're located in the USA in Washington State near the town of Wenatchee, Washington.

It's all about who owns the equipment, not who hosts it. We can allow people to have ownership over part of the network, by hosting it for them. That could be an attractive offer to millions of people, who think Bitcoin might be the next new big thing like the internet.
The Bitcoin mining market is going from once being in the hands a wide group of enthusiasts all over the world, to perhaps being monopolized by a few mines in a few regions of the world.
We put that miner ownership, indirectly through us, back into the hands of those small players.
We also strongly request to our customers, and work to educate them that they should be using a small pool or p2pool. If asking them and educating them does not work, we will ban access to large pools.

We have a location in Hilsboro. That location is sold out.
We will not sell our capacity at our Washington location until our build is finished and we have the capacity available.
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:02:17
More miners make it harder to perform a 51% attack, making Bitcoin more secure.

Engineers which design data centers for a living designed our mine. They designed the Microsoft datacenter nearby in Quincy, Washington.
The air in our part of Washington is very dry, not humid. We're in the rain shadow of the mountains. Also we do have coolers.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:19:55
There's need to worry, we'll be putting in **sexy-looking LEDs and blacklights** before the launch.
You think the mine will be drab?
We'll have the most fabulous mine in town! ;)
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:00:16
Dimensions are 38 ft x 82 ft x 90 ft.

If the risk of fire was significant, then we would be forced by law to put in a fire suppression system.
It's not. This is why we can insure $100k of our customer's equipment for $70/month.
It's easy to be an armchair quarterback when you're not the one faced with the choice to put in a fire suppression system which costs more than the data center itself.

Backup generators and UPSes are a really bad idea for Bitcoin mining.
You will never ROI on the price tag of the UPS or the generator only, considering the value of the Bitcoin you will mine when the UPS is providing power. 
Generators and UPSs are for webservers and stuff like that, where downtime costs thousands of times as much as the hosting fees themselves.
A UPS costs $20,000 for 20 minutes of 200 kW capacity. If you use that 6 times a year for a full 20 minutes per blackout with SP30s at current difficulty, that's 2 hours of hashing per year at around 400 TH/s, or about $700 per year you get out of a $20,000 investment.
We'd prefer to take that 20k and pass it along as savings for our customers.
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:03:51
I'd be happy to refer you to an enterprise datacenter where you'll pay upwards of $200/kw/month.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:45:23
Ahh the old insurance catch 22. Damned if you have it, damned if you don't.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:40:53
We're located in a small town less than a half hour drive from wenatchee that has its own fire department.

You should try [Hosting Your Bitcoin Miner at a Data Center Instead.](
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:27:31
We plan to do a p2pool node.
@_date: 2014-06-23 00:05:00
We will run a p2pool node for our customers to use.
We are not a cloud service, we are a hosting provider. Customers retain ownership and rights over their own equipment. It's up to them to manage their miners.
It's a high priority of ours to educate our customers to not use large pools, and each will receive a personal letter explaining how it's disrespectful to ASICSPACE's vision to be doing so.
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:18:55
We are a well-funded operation and could easily do things the traditional data center way. We have money to buy UPSs, generators, and gaseous fire suppression. It is a purposeful choice not do so, so we can offer the lowest prices anywhere. Only with low pricing can we begin to attract the individual miner market.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:44:24
We make sure that their power supplies are power factor corrected.
We're not going to accept hardware from a known risky manufacturer like Black Arrow.
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:27:46
It's $70 up to $100k. It doesn't insure the data center but our customers equipment. We have additional insurance for the data center. We'll also have to buy more once we pass $100k.

Bitcoin mining uses lots and lots of power. Our company's electricity comes 100% from renewable sources.
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:04:19
Thanks Gabriel. Good luck with the [launch of your bitcoin exchange!](
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:33:59
Our customers are free to mine where they wish. We considered banning Ghash.io for some time, but decided that it would be best to respect our customers ownership over their equipment, and work to educate them. On our website we voice our opinion that we consider it to be disrespectful to our company's vision to be mining on a large pool.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:43:27
You're totally right, our customer's equipment is the weakest link. Most of it isn't UL certified.
I know if we accept black arrow hardware some of those boards are definitely going to fry.
Also a fault from a shitty power supply could cause our breakers to trip.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:18:08
1) We're in an industrial building. We are getting industrial electricity rates, which are even cheaper than residential rates. The PUD definitely know we exist, we've been talking with them for months.
2) Power outages are very rare, one of the most stable grids in the nation. UPSs/Generators cost more than the electricity you generate with with them.
3) Concrete building, metal shelves, to code electrical distribution, smoke detectors, and insurance.
4) That is a good point. I'll look through the fine print more throughly.
5) Our insurance does. We have CCTVs, motion sensors, door sensors. The building is made of concrete, has no windows.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:43:22
If asking our customers to not mine on large pools, and educating them does not work, then we will ban large pools.
We feel strongly about this issue of centralization as well. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:02:38
A lot of customers ask us about this, which is understandable given the disaster at that Thailand mine.
A inert gas fire suppression system is very pricey, and would likely cost more than everything else in the data center combined.
We've taken several steps to reduce the risk of fire. The most common reason there would be a fire is if there isn't proper sizing of the wires, or if there isn't proper grounding.
Steps we've taken:
* Everything is professionally installed and engineered, and sized correctly, and we've erred on the side of caution.
* We have proper overcurrent, power surge and fault current protection installed.
* All of our equipment is US sourced. No cheap Chinese gear here. Everything UL and IEC certified.
* Nothing flammable is in the building. This isn't a barn, it's a building made of concrete with metal shelving.
* We have a data-center grade fire detection system, with fire extinguishers located throughout the premises.
* Fire station is minutes away.
* All of our customers equipment is insured for its full value in the event of fire.
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:27:03
We may begin to accept non-rack mountable equipment at some point.
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:50:30
$525 if you pay a year in advance, $675 monthly.

You should look at bitcoin miner hosting/co-location.
More legit than cloudmining as you're getting hashpower from real hardware that you own.
Check out pictures of our hosting mine:

funny, the engineering group we're partnered with made a blog post about this topic. Check it out, it's a good read: 
@_date: 2014-06-23 00:23:49
Thanks for the tip! I haven't checked those sites out yet.
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:57:55
Spinklers = water = bad.
All the electricals in the datacenter are to code and installed by professional electricians, everything is non-flammable, etc.
Plus even if everything disappears in a puff of smoke we're insured with Farmers for 100% of the replacement value of everything in the data center.
@_date: 2014-12-08 08:57:23
Well it is under construction.
@_date: 2014-06-22 23:46:13
Nobody is posting on that anymore and we'd like to reach out to more people.

By the way, backup generators and UPSes are a really bad idea for bitcoin mining. You will never ROI on the price tag of the UPS or the generator only looking at mining during the times when primary power is off. Generators and UPSs are for webservers and stuff like that, where downtime costs thousands of times as much as the hosting fees themselves. This is especially true for UPS, since those machines typically cost about $20,000 for 20 minutes of 200 kW capacity. If you use that 6 times a year for a full 20 minutes per blackout with SP30s at current difficulty, that's 2 hours of hashing per year at around 400 TH/s, or about $700 per year you get out of a $20,000 investment.
We'd prefer to pass along those savings to our customer instead.
@_date: 2014-06-23 00:22:33
We will host anything that can be mounted on a rack.
A list can be found on our website [ASICSPACE]( here: [List of Accepted Hardware](
We just host and maintain your equipment. It's up to you to choose what model of ASIC you want and get it to us. You can ship direct from the manufacturer if you choose.
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:54:55
Well, the centralization would be worse if we were not here. Individual miners would just die out completely. So our presence, therefore promotes its decentralzation.
@_date: 2014-12-27 23:56:50
We have temperature sensors located throughout the mine.
If there's an issue with cooling, our software will automatically detect that something is wrong, and send us an alert, so we can determine if an emergency shutdown is necessary.
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:51:44
I know from your username you are troll, but you bring up good points so I'm going to answer them anyway.
We don't provide pictures of our facility for the reason listed on our website. We have proprietary methods to power and cool your miners and we don't want to share them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:09:48
Ugh.. cloud mining ponzis.
For the love of God, if all of the people who have gotten burned by cloudmining would realize what good rates and how easy it is to have hardware hosted, the scams would end. (and our data center would be full many times over).
We have no setup fees and we charge less than 11 cents/kwh,(most Americans pay more than that for electricity) to host your miners in our data center, we provide a full turnkey hosting service. That includes power, networking, cooling, maintenance, and direct remote access to your miners.

There's no reason to explain the technology behind it.
What I usually say is "digital money that can be stored on your computer, which you can send from one computer to another between any two places in the world, instantaneously and with no transaction fees, without the knowledge or approval of a government or bank."
Not entirely 100% accurate, but it illustrates the basic concept and potential of the technology.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:08:00
While it is true that the Bitcoin difficulty responds somewhat to movements in price as marginally profitable miners turn off when their electricity cost exceeds their revenue, remember that it takes months to design and manufacture ASICs, so movements in difficulty lag movements in price by several months.
Also consider that chips are always getting more efficient as manufacturers catch up with Moore's law, so even at an unchanging, stagnant price, we'd expect to see positive changes in difficulty.

Use multisig escrow with Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:03:53
We want to be active players in the ecosystem, and more than just electricity drains.
Our investor sees Bitcoin mining not only as a good opportunity, but thinks Bitcoin itself is undervalued and wants to get in on it.
Our costs are below 50% of our revenue so that's not the reason.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:18:52
Our mining business actually holds about a quarter of our Bitcoin.
We're about 2PH, or 6/10th's of a percent of the network.
