The thing is, that it doesn‘t really matter much in terms of optimal trading strategy if it is a bubble or not. If it is a bubble, it is individually rational to buy in while it is going up and to sell as quickly as you can once it starts to pop. Rinse and repeat.
If it is not a bubble, buy in anyway if you expect continuous increases in price. Once prices reach a level you feel is unjustified and expect the price to drop, sell. Rinse and repeat.
Bubble or not can only be determined ex-post, given that there is no somewhat accurate measure for the inherent value of bitcoin.

Most ATMs accept credit cards (Mastercard / Visa) I believe. Given that those who travel abroad usually have a credit card, I never understood how those currency exchange stalls could survive in the first place. 
Using an ATM at the destination airport with your home credit card + pin code is so much more convenient and usually banks provide almost human exchange rates.
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:18:42
I have been looking into it a little more and must say that I was partly wrong. Apparently, it highly depends on the country+bank combination issuing the card. Mastercards / Visa credit cards are not created equal, it seems.
An example: For an atm cash withdrawal I pay exactly the same lump sum euro fee at home as at any compatible atm world-wide. No matter which amount or currency I am withdrawing. 
I infer from your reply, that this is not the case everywhere.
At the same time, my country's debit card system does not use master card / visa card technology. So they are usually no use outside the country.

Well of course you could in theory peg a virtual currency to a fiat one. Pegging simply is the process of buying / selling the currency for other currencies in a way that it's exchange rate relative to the one you are pegging to does not change.
If the crypto currency appreciates relative to the one you are pegging to, you have to sell it to counter the increase in demand, which potentially requires huge amounts of the crypto currency at your disposal.
If it depreciates relative to the other currency, you need to buy which vice versa could requires enormous amounts of the fiat currency.
I bet people would actually try to break the pegging by either extremely reducing or increasing demand for the crypto currency in order to test the pegging "promise".
If you are interested in real world examples look at switzerland's ceiling exchange rate on the euro / swiss franc which was put in place during the financial crisis and is somewhere around 1.20 if i remember correctly.
edit: also, to be effective the buy/sell actions that counter demand have to be carried out quickly. The only way to achieve this would probably computerized... now we end up with huge sums of fiat and crypto managed by a machine - let's hope the software is not buggy...
@_date: 2013-05-06 20:36:25
Okay i give you the run down:
The numbers are coordinates, but they are in the wrong order (initially u land off the coast of somalia). If you switch the numbers, you end up in France.
zoom in to identify an "s" shape in a lake. On second thought it looks like a "snake".
"snake" decrypts the first cryptobin.
You find a link to a [picture](
one clue is "Titel of boek" which translates to "Book Title", examining the picture "TROPHY HUNT" is an easy try.
The hint says "scroll down", so we scroll down in the cryptobin to find a link to a second cryptobin.
This cryptobin can be decoded with "TROPHY HUNT", the book title we found earlier. What you get is the private key.

@_date: 2013-06-19 16:12:51
that's why typically central banks do the pegging - they can print additional currency if they need to. 
However, the other way round, they can still run out of foreign currency to buy back the own currency.

Actually, you might end up receiving $1,50 every other time they park in your spot in the future.


You basically said: Parking here is only okay, if you pay me $1,50 (my opportunity costs of not having the spot for myself).
Now they can park there and get rid of their potentially bad consciousness by paying you the little parking fee. You might want to set a different incentive next time ;)

well, the winning bidder and the seller are bound by their contract, both sides have promised to deliver.

@_date: 2013-06-02 08:36:09
You described it quite well. Making a transaction always evolves all coins on the sender address. Part of it goes to the recipient, the other part either back to the sender address or to a newly generated address in sender's wallet. Behavior depends on client, settings, online implementation...
Default should be to have a new address for the "change" as it makes tracking of funds and thus identification of the sender more complicated.
@_date: 2013-06-19 07:49:20


Yes, probably. Afaik they are still shipping orders for these which were placed last year.


Difficulty goes up every 2000 something blocks. Without knowing which calculator you used, this is hard to answer, as some take difficulty increases (predicted that is) into account, some don't. Also, it depends pretty crucially on what you pay for electricity. My conservative guess would be: calculate the break even with one of the calculators when you have the miner set up and running (remember the backlog of orders!) Then double that estimate. If you reach break even earlier, you have a reason to celebrate! :)


Hard to answer. Pools provide more steady income, solo mining is quite the lottery in terms of "steady income"


Seeing that BF now has working 500Gh/s miners (although it is unclear in which numbers they are shipping and when...) and rumors have it that other companies are preparing for a 2nd gen miner release in the fall, most people predict sharp increases in difficulty in the weeks / months to come. 
A 5 Gh/s miner might not break even in the short time spans calculators suggest. 
But hey, nevertheless it's pretty cool to have a small box under your desk that hums along "converting" electricity into money, isn't it? Also I believe it is a great learning experience to get into bitcoin mining, even if it's just with the tip of a toe ;)
@_date: 2013-07-03 09:56:58

@_date: 2013-04-12 16:08:07
well i do not see a problem in volatile exchange rates, here is why:
At the moment, most merchants use fiat-currency on a daily basis. Offering to accept bitcoins as an alternative currency is not a problem at all, assuming they just adjust their prices according to the exchange rate.  I have read before that there are already payment providers in the bitcoin market who offer this.
Put simply: If you shop online and see a price like $60, it might well be the case that you see a "1 BTC" right next to it. If the exchange rate changes and you come back like 2 hours later, the shop might just show: "$60 or 1,2 BTC". 
If the merchant believes in bitcoins and finds a payment provider who can offer automatic recalculation of prices based on (weighted / averaged) exchange rates, there is barrier to accepting bitcoins at all. Even if the exchange rate is extremly volatile.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:05:08
i did not cash out any BTCs, but i transfered some away to my bitcoin wallet. That went smoothly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:46:51
this is not the Bitcoin "economy" it is just bitcoin trade related.
If you want to do something sustainable, get more shops to accept bitcoin as alternative methods of payment and tell friends and family about the system (not so much about the volatility of exchange markets).
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:59:56

@_date: 2013-04-10 10:47:51
If you have a verified account, which I now assume u do, then you can request an increase of the withdraw limit by emailing their support (it says so in my confirmation of verification email). This should allow you to get up to 10x your current daily withdraw limit, according to the email i got.
Then again, withdrawing 1000 a day (10,000 a month) is a lot to cash out.
You are aware that withdrawing only means actually transferring away from mtgox and doesn't have anything to do with how much you can trade in one day (afaik)?

getting into a new area, trying new things never is a bad thing and usually leads to quite a lot of learning along the way.
Just don't give in to illusions, the price of bitcoins may very well collapse some time (in the near future). Right now, the bitcoin exchange market looks a lot like a casino on LSD. So, start small, only "invest" what you can loose without getting into trouble.
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:28:34
I do not seem to understand what the lag comes from. To me, there should be two lists, one for bid and one for ask orders. Appending items (orders) to these lists can't be that hard.

well, what is the incentive for exchanges to merge and form this "ring of trusted exchanges"? They loose freedom in their business operations and I do not think they'll like that.
also, without an easy way to move fiat-currency between exchanges we will not see a common exchange rate among those exchanges as it is not profitable to exploit arbitrage.

The good thing is that if markets work, it does not matter who is endowed with what amount, because trading will take place and distribute them efficiently. Aka [Coase Theorem](
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:31:47
Well, sure, closure of one or more of the biggest exchanges will greatly decrease the liquidity in the market. The problem is their model of actually keeping fiat-currency accounts i think. This can easily lead to them being classified as banks / financial intermediaries which could lead to a huge load of restrictions, regulations etc. that could ultimately lead to them being shut down because of non-compliance with these rules.
However, there are other exchange models. These offer the service of verifying bank accounts and listing buy and sell orders. However, they never get a hold of the cash.
transactions work like this:
1. A seller wants to sell some of his coins and lists a sell offer on their site
2. the site/exchange puts a hold on the amount of bitcoins to be sold
3. a buyer chooses a seller from the list (of prices in diff. currencies) and opts to buy a certain amount of coins
4. buyer receives an email containing the verified bank details of the seller
5. buyer makes a wire transfer of the amount, stating a transaction ID as the purpose
6. seller watches his account, once he sees the money, he checks a box on the exchange
7. the exchange transfers the bitcoins to the buyer
8. buyer and seller both rate each other, generating a "trust level"
The exchange only brings together buyers and sellers and keeps records of bitcoins, which are essentially zeros and ones (nothing illegal about numbers, is there?). It also offers the verification and takes a little fee of every transaction for its services.
Big difference to mtGox &amp; co: It never holds the fiat-cash, it is basically just a provider of (verified / trusted) buyers and sellers.
disadvantage(?): trading is MUCH slower...
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:21:46
okay, so we only get historical values, that is valuable information!
I was expecting some kind of regression that is run on the data and then used to predict arbitrary transactions for a given volume / fee combination. the result would have to include some prediction interval (say 95% or 99%..)

Well, there is a more fundamental issue here I think. If it is your joint / shared account, you might need to do some convincing or don't do it if your partner is not ok with it.
However, nothing should stop you from investing *your own* money. Money which *you* worked for. I believe your partner would just have to accept your decision then.

Well what do we learn from this? All clients should check for exceptional transaction fees (say larger than mean fee + 2 standard deviations for simplicity) and then ask the user to confirm the unusual fee.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:28:29
sure, it's called arbitrage.
right now the problem is passing fiat-currency from one exchange to the other. BTC is not a problem (if u are willing to pay a fee to have it confirmed quickly).
However, this is where the problems start: frees. pushing money around costs money, so the differences have to be big enough. It is also time consuming, which makes arbitrage even less proftable at the moment.

Although it looks like their hashrate went from 2gh/s to over 70gh/s, their paid dividends mainly come from the 100 asicminer shares they hold.

If bitcoin is a currency, it's value is determined by the trust in it by those who use it as a means of exchange and storage of value. These two aspects are not jumping anywhere, they should move along a predictable path if it is adopted by enough people. Why predictable? Because the only thing determining its value then is its scarcity. 
What you are talking about when u say value is actually a bitcoin's price in a currently adopted currency: the exchange rate. Volatility of the exchange rate is not a problem for merchants who have to use fiat currency to pay their employees and to buy their daily bread. It just means they have to adjust their bitcoin prices for their goods all the time. Luckily there are payment providers for bitcoins out there, which can help with that.
@_date: 2013-05-26 09:41:10
Why the 10 bets limit?
 
Just present a counter how many bets there are for each direction instead of having users looking up themselves. That is way to inconvenient. 
Seeing the huge chunk you keep as a fee, this is the least u can do.
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:57:35
There is no guarantee that this is not going to happen.
Currently we are betting on the networking effect of bitcoin. Once enough people, businesses etc are committed, it is hard to leave and establish something else as *the* accepted form of payment.
Basically, the more people use it, the longer it takes and the harder it gets to replace it
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:06:14
To 1) thanks to the dezentralized model, a majority of nodes has to accept and adopt the changes. otherwise the rest of the network will just regard any transactions etc. following the new, changed protocol, as invalid and discard them.
To 3) and 5) it is infinitely divisible. Just add more decimals.
4) no backing, that is true. However, if a fiat currency crashes, ie there is hyper inflation, the only thing a gov can do is replace it with a new currency and hope everyone trusts that again.
6) adoption takes time.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:09:40
well, mainly there is a lot of information available about the company, such as the registration with the Japanese Chamber of Commerce (
Furthermore their track-record is "ok". There has been one true security breach that I am aware of (2011), but apart from that their services seem to run smoothly.
Their practices seem to be solid (verification of account information etc.) and there are little reports of strange occurances of any kind on the interwebs.
EDIT: The real question should be, why so many traders trust Tibanne Co. Ltd. more than other exchange operators (as seen from the trading volume distribution).

It's called network effect.

@_date: 2013-04-19 15:38:51
They way bitcoin handles it, is, that it sends the total amount out, one part to the address you are making the transfer to, and the other part to a "change" address. This address is actually also yours, it is just handled invisibly for you in the background. Next time you make a transaction, that (now "new") address will be the origin and again your amount will be sent to the receiving address + a then again new "change address" handled invisibly. You might want to read up on how transactions are handled on the bitcoin wiki.
tl;dr: its fine. the client is doing the work for you.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:23:39
don't get me wrong, i am not complaining. I would just like to optimize my use of the transaction fee. I mean.. with 5btc we talk about roughly $700 and my fee was roughly $0.07. So, actually I would not mind to pay like 15cents to get it done more quickly, seeing that it is still minor in comparison to the transaction volume.
But why would it get faster? Blocks will keep appearing roughly every 10 minutes, but transaction volume will dramatically increase (hopefully). 
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:26:51
very nice. Thank you very much!
So according to these tables i had roughly a 77% chance of it being included in the next one.
However, how can it be that a tenfold fee of 0.005 (instead of 0.0005) would have left me with a lower chance (76%&lt;77%), keeping the volume constant at &lt;=10btc?

the problem is not the exchange, the problem is implementing a decentralized "bank account" for fiat-currency that allows to put funds "on hold" while transactions are processed and ultimately automatically settles them.
@_date: 2013-04-30 23:16:19
but.. if higher willingness to pay a fee (= paying a higher fee) does not give you an advantage over those who are willing to spend less, then that sounds an aweful lot like economic inefficiency! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:23:36
Well right you can horde them, but so what? There are people horsing fiat currencies everywhere. Lots of rich people have more than they could possibly spend in a lifetime. Does that affect those who use it everyday? No, it does not. If however, you see bitcoin less as a currency and more as a commodity, then the implication is different, because then people are actually interested in the exchange rate into fiat currencies. If this is the case, the value will increase and hording makes perfect sense. However, if you drain all the liquidity from the market, and only a few people have a lot of them, will people stay interested in them? No, they will move on, choose a different commodity and the exchange rate will plummet. So much for getting rich by hording...

fun modification:
Have people enter a private key to their account PLUS a receiving address from another wallet they own.
pull trigger, if nothing happens, your btc are send to your second address, eliminating the risk of someone else (the website owner) having your private key to a wallet which is still filled.
if it fires, you lose the coins, but they are not destroyed but instead send to a random address from the pool of addresses.
this pool should only include the second (receiving) addresses of people who lost their coins when pulling the trigger.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:19:25
well.. you could go into time series analysis and check if there is some point in the mining volume data, from which the volume per time period significantly increases beyond the underlying trend and test if this is somehow correlated (significantly) with dates of press-relases, delay-announcements or similar from BFL.

payment providers have services in place that continously updates the BTC price associated with the good. If the exchange rate is up, you only play a low sum of btc for the good. if it is down, the amount of btc goes up. in the end, the merchant should only carry the exchange rate risk of btc after the trade with his customer is completed

Why bottom out? The only thing that will change is the exchange rate, which will drop if early adopters cash out heavily. So what? A chance for everyone else to get some cheaper (in fiat currency terms)
Again, read up about the coase theorem I mentioned earlier.

Well if you have a wallet on blockchain.info (as I do for stuff like this...) you can just choose to "import private key" and it will add the address to your wallet.
I then transferred the money from the imported address to one of my own. Afterwards I deleted the private key from my wallet (this is not necessary, but i don't want to have an address in there with publicly known private key).

10% above exchange rates while they have a downward trend? y would u do that?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:33
p2p, no fees. Get the required computing power this way: make data only available to those running the client and have the client run calculations in the background (like the first btc clients did). Those who trade heavily have the software open all the time and thus contribute more computing power then those not trading actively.

the problem with stopping to use mtgox is, that it's just the most liquid exchange. Futhermore, if you went through the trouble of getting verfied, why getting verified somewhere else too? it just means work and people are lazy.
To be honest, as long as it's working, mtgox is quick and easy imho.

@_date: 2013-04-15 11:46:16
I am not sure if there is any historical data available, but you could start analysing right away. Just let a script use the blockchain.info api and get the unconfirmed transactioncount every 1 minute (5, 10, 60... whatever suits your efforts). You might also want to check correlation with the number of transactions in the last 24h.
It does not help you right away, but you should be able to find patterns within a couple of weeks of data gathering

I have sent a request for comment to their support.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:30:50
why would it? the difficulty will increase accordingly to stay at the target of roughly 1 block every 10minutes (on average).
They only option I see is an increase in the number of transactions confirmed per block. Seeing that it currently varies widely from 1-2 Transactions up to hundreds, i don't seem to understand the underlying mechanism.
@_date: 2013-04-20 07:24:45
Well my code is just the basic structure and certainly unsafe to use ( I do not Check in anyway what the server returns for example)
You should look into [the API documentation]( for more requests that you can handle similarly and their return structure.
There you will also find information on how to get market depth data, ie the volume that is currently associated to price levels

For end users this might be true. For businesses however, any change of the payment processing architecture *is* costly. Also I believe a lot of businesses are still operating on a "never touch a running system" principle when it comes to essential parts such as the payment processing systems.

it says that the public prosecution department has garnished Simons Commerzbank account including all current and future receivables in accordance with the order to seize his financial assets given by the Amtsgericht Tiergarten. Therefore, they cannot refund your money at this time.
You are asked to direct your inquiries directly to the Public Prosecution Department of Berlin (Staatsanwaltschaft Berlin, Turmstr. 91, Berlin (Moabit)). Make sure to include the case number (Geschäftsnummer) 249 Js 380/13
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:25
Well, right now, most exchanges are down / floodded whatever, so right now there is no real market price i would say.
During "normal" trading, there are several reasons for price differences, such as trading fee differences, differences in overall cost to access it (say u get payed in EUR but want to trade in USD because of higher liquidity, you have exchange fees.. etc)
Different prices may also stem from the liquidity aspect, resulting in some exchanges "lagging" behind others in terms of market moving.
Normally, you would expect arbitrage to set in once there are price differences between exchanges, but if cost are associated with exploiting the arbitrage opportunities, exploiting might in fact not be profitable, so it doesn't happen and prices stay different across exchanges.

As stated before:
1) MtGox is the platform with highest liquidity
2) It is easy to use, and quite quick if it is working
3) API is great, gives information and even allows trading. Websocket data anyone?
4) getting verfied means work and waiting, no one wants that. once u are verified at one place, you don't want to go somewhere else
5) new people always go to the most trusted place first.

Your plan sounds good to me. However: How do you want to make sure to be able to open the TrueCrypt Volume and possibly the encrypted wallet file after time has passed. If you plan to use a secure (also meaning not used for anything else...) password, make sure to have a backup of that as well, preferably in non-digital form kept away from the backup drives. The best backup does not help you, if you have for some reason forgotten your secure password over the weeks, months or years...
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:10
The problem with a decentralized exchange is that you must make sure that fiat-currency is actually available at purchase of BTC, is then put "on hold" for the time the btc transfer takes and is then automatically transfered to the seller of btc without any party being able to interfere. 
So you need to have some "decentralized fiat currency account" that can only be used for transfers that others aprove off.

I like your setup a lot and I am actually thinking about reproducing it for personal use. It is quite user / newbe friendly once it is set up, but the problem I see is, that a person has to trust you with the private keys to the safe deposit boxes. It might be ok for close friends or relatives, but with coworkers I wouldn't feel good to use something someone else set up for me.

Don't forget that at least the costs for mining coins are sunk costs as soon as they are found. In subsequent barter it does not matter anymore, because the resources have been "wasted" anyway, no matter if you spend the coin or not. The valuation only depends on what you and your exchange partner agree upon, not on what resource amount you put into the coin before, because you had these costs anyway, no matter if you now trade it or not.

straight from my wallet managed from bitcoin-qt, fully synced and ready to go. The bitcoins i used originated from a single address, so it was not a very complex transaction (combining thousands of satoshis...) either.

You also have to consider constraints, such as adequate space (cooling, lots of cheap power...) and (maintenance) time constraints.

I don't think this will be enough. People must have the ability to come after scammers. Just think about how we would deal with an online shop that does not deliver. Right. We would get their contact details / company information, eventually get a lawyer and sue.
However, this does not work in the case of bitcoin, as we are all from different countries and thus do not really fear prosecution. Apart from that, everybody would have to give up their privacy and make themselves known to all other exchange members.

well, i see many ways to go for the price once mtgox reopens:
1) people did not cancel their market sell orders during the timeout -&gt; we go way way way down...
2) people canceled their sell orders, and are not camping the servers -&gt; mtgox comes up, price adjusts to what is payed on other exchanges
3) people camp the order page, hammer in buy orders -&gt; mtgox goes down again, DoS-ed by their customers

A couple of weeks ago we had a fire at a local ISP hub / node. It took down all landline phones, all cell towers and needless to say all Internet communication for 150,000+ people.
It was ugly: no emergency calls whatsoever, no ATMs working, No banks being able to do business, no card payments, almost all businesses closed bc their it systems rely on Internet access.
