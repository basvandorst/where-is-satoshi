If price keeps on this steady decline we've been seeing for the past four months, we may all wind up living in mud huts in Zimbabwe. Then we can dig our own wells and reminiscence together about the days of $1200 bitcoin.

Are you guys getting spooked or do you still back the $40,000 per coin figure from last year?
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:22:23
lol I doubt it, but if we reach out to the people of Africa (not just Zimbabwe) we can teach them how to buy bitcoins and they can prosper too when bitcoins go up in value again. Bitcoin can save the world!
But what are we doing? Just wasting our time bullshitting each other about $10 price movements. You should all be ashamed.

Yes, it looks like the great bitcoin experiment is coming to an end (or at least the speculative aspect is) but at least we can say we've learned one major lesson: don't day trade and never invest heavily in one asset class.

I'm spreading awareness and trying my best to organize the bitcoin community to greater causes.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:44:40
Getting people to stop checking prices and refreshing reddit and going out and LIVING their lives!
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:12:13
I'm literally shaking with anger right now 
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:11:14
What they steal?
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:58:32
50/50 sob stories about not selling now at $400+, and sob stories about people who have lost $thousands and need to file bankruptcy because bitcoin has dropped &lt;$100.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:58:09
What happened to the whites in Zimbabwe? I thought everyone in Africa was black (or like 99.9%).
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:54:08
This time IS different. The bitcoin bubble has finally burst, and we're going back to 2010 prices. If that's not clear to everyone yet, it will be soon.
Oh well, all I can do is try to warn you all. Nobody can say that I haven't tried.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:28:34
lol I think they sell shovels in Africa too.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:41:11
only fool sell now... it ridicurous! bitcoin at rock bottom prices and go up from soon!
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:46:29
When you're on your deathbed, the last thing you will think is, "I wish I had spent more time refreshing the subreddit.

You can't dig a well with a Caterpillar, mate. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:34:54
Hmm.. that's kind of a good point actually. I'll have to get back to you on that. But I think part of the issue is locating the proper location to dig at, so it's not just digging, but locating as well.
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:21:14
what you're witnessing is the bitcoin bubble burst. I'm not talking about the Nov 2013 bubble; this is THE bitcoin bubble. For four years it's been on speculative overdrive. We're now hitting a major correction at a magnitude that we've never seen before.
Bitcoin needs to prove itself as a legitimate payment system before prices go back up again, and that means fixing the problems that have plagued it in recent months. Will it happen? Maybe... or maybe not. In any case, it will take at least a couple years to find out, I suspect.
If you want to HODL, get ready to ride our a long wait.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:59:52
Maybe they do, but it's impossible to transport to a rural mud hut village. Maybe if I can receive enough bitcoin donations to build a modern highway and transport lol
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:16:55
it's a good idea; and while we're there digging wells we can teach the locals about the benefits of bitcoin. Not speculation bullshit.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:11:47
I'm going to dig wells for people in Africa. At least I've realized that I've contributed nothing, and now I'm trying to help others see the light.
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:36:00
Many of these merchants get persuaded to accept bitcoins because it's a cheap system to implement, but then pull it a couple months later because nobody is actually using them for spending.
~~Of course, most of these merchants take a long time to be removed from coinmap~~ so now we're up to 4,000! Such success!
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:09:05
Looks like dog shit coin is doing real well these days.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:04:20
everyone take a note so we don't need to post it again!
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:17:07
more like, we're in 2000 and all holding $14 shares in pets.com
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:14:47
thanks all for the cheap coins! nom nom nom
