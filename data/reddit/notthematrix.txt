"Bitcoin with lightning will allow a network of centralized control"
You are really clueless on lightning.
The network is as tor , nobody except sender and reciever can see the transaction.
"Are transactions public?
No, transactions on the Lightning Network are not publicly broadcast. Instead, they are encrypted and routed from the payer to the payee via intermediate nodes, using a tor-like onion routing protocol.
In other words, Lightning transactions offer significant privacy improvements over regular on-blockchain transactions."
the real reason all the max fudding is that soon bitcoin will be private! , nodes have zero control over who is transacting or see what is passing true.

Great peace!
I see exactly this mechanism.
I see it as a black hole this is because of the nature of bitcoin its finite in supply.  
fiat is infinite so it will fall down in price against the finite supply of  bitcoin.
This will stop banks from printing infinite if they don´t they self destruct.
Conspiracy: 
1  system replacement will reset all debts.
2  a system not in control by one single group is only acceptable system for a golden global standard.

nope iof it is removed from the suppley the exchange can no longer double lent the coin.
if they do use uncovered  shorting it will fail he moment hey have to buy the REAL btc yo cover the price!
Yes this should not happen but this is the issue with the current fractional reserve system used on exchanges.
if you own the coin that coin can not be created out of thin air like they do with fiat.

its simple on exchanges you have uncovered bitcoins and covered bitcoin.

because it will replace it! , why?
the very fact NOBODY can control its creation , makes it accepable for ALL country's to use as reserve!

this game can not be played forever everybody knows.

Just HOLD your coins its 21.000.000 BTC ever so prices will go up at 1 point , yes they can try to dump coins but they cant do that forever! so who cares about this price , manipulating BTC out of weak hand is all they can do, its just like in 2014 HOLD \(HODL\)

What ver fails tho see is bitcoin as the golden standard...
the reason why is it is its limitations!
You must realize that the banking system is on its last legs.
  (listen to this interview)
and there bitcoin as a golden stadard comes important.
Bitcoin could be the savoir but not as a primary payment system , but as a golden standard...
A payment system can be made in L2 , witch does not harm the gold standard High security blockchain ... , just read the book Swiming with sharks  joris-luyendijk
And this is exacly why BTC-U has no value at al and btc-core will keep its price!!!

This is honest! and understandable, Minders are needed lika asecond layer for faster tarnsactions but it can never be that miners miss out on fees , so there must be a maganism build in that miners get a fee based on number of transactions + total value inside layer2.
So miners don't miss out IMO miner could get more fee so more people start mining and mining gets more decentralized  , and more miner hardware will be bought and sold.
what jihan says here is fair and ANTMINER S9 are very stable miners so i would be a shame if this company will go.

Segwit has a natural limitation. is is not secure if channel fials evrything wil be restored in prior state...
This limits the transactions you want to do offchain!
On the other hand you can ask for higher fees on chain!
But segwith is very abstract can people fully understand this? 
Mining must become profitable for everyone , He sells good mining equipment , stable good working stuff.
If transaction fee goes up thats ok  , for bigger transactions , smaller transactions will be layer 2 , limitation could be build in layer2 but imo that is already because you dont have security of blockchain , if channel break people lose money....
at least he looks honest here , there should be a way out , nobody wants bitcoin to crash ,,, its a golden standard ... the second layer can be the fiat part....
My idea put in segwith for smaller fast  transactions allow higher fees for stored transactions on chain!
fe put nuber of transaction conet in 2nd layer , so fee can be higher!!!

@_date: 2017-03-17 16:04:59
"exchanges will assign the label "BTC" to a chain with different rules simply because it has more hashpower."
Well not quite
Well if the miner fees are higher on the sigwit chain because of more
nodes and stil imited block size for miner settelemt , + more using it , remember thet the BU nodes have bugs , and run on older code , the segwit chain will be the more secure chain..
and there is a other reason  why sigwit  wil win ....
and the chain will probably not split. 
it has to do with privacy features possible with segwit...
and PRIVACY is a very important motivation/feature for users to switch to segwit . also exchanges like this because  of plausible deniability so they don't need to check were coins are coming from if ever asked by Authorities.
they can simpley say we dont know.
Miners will use the chain most used , if segwit features privacy that will be the most used chain by people owning the most coins in the age of  Surveillance.
Final point , Small miners will go for smal blocks + segwit...
Its only the big miner wanting BU because it forces 
centralization! because unlimited blocks size is more space 
is unlimited lower fees , is race to the bottom.
(UASF) will restore this balance and stop this race to the bottom.
Because miners dont want to mine for a coin nobody wants to use!
BU will still have the 10 minutes confirmation time.
segwit+privacy activated coin will not for small transactions.

they can block that by forking the client.

side-chains ,,, and segwith , but first they fiat system must crash its fubar , and yes organisation are free to set up a system that does not put any tiny transaction on the blockchain.
exchanges do this now , stores and shopping malls can do the same... also bitpay can also do this for internal transactions... saving network space and keeping costs low...
if you bundle  100 small transactions as one on the bitcoin blockchain it makes low costs anonymity and keeps miners happy...

they don't look at facts they just want to be against main stream , so they will always fail and complain about it.

You can move miners quite easy reprogram your pooldata to slush  restart mining and go! you do not need to physicly restart your miners!
I think a lot of miners did this to be sure they were mining the core chain!
Its also not hard to do this in batch.
on the other hand stip mining bch at 40 blocks does not show any way of support for bch :)  it wil be over in a view hours!

Bitcoin is **IN MUTABLE STORE OF VALUE** its better then gold.

Asicboost can be made with any other coin , a coin is scamming 
coin when people get confused easy.
This is the case with bitcoin cash , it is made to confuse people.
This is also why jihan wu got a warning , also in china they have anti scamming laws.
and rich chinees getting scammed is not good.
using the same address space as a other coin is a scam coin!
That will be the rule soon , so if you split off in a way that the system is no longer compatible to the other chain.
Like BCH did , you need to change address format ... 
also SW changed address format by using 3. instead of 1.

 version has a single-board-test that does not call home. I had to set my miner to 650 again it started at the lowest possible frequency of 550 I think it calls home to see what frequency th miner is confiured to , with the firmware link I posted you can set this your self! /cgi-bin/minerConfiguration1.cgi gve access to the extra option in settings menu to set frequency! in this firmware!
It starts at lowest freq by default if you use the extra option you can reset the default freq of the miner. WATCH MINER TEMPRATURE! but you can test it for 650 = 14TH 600 = 12.93 TH and 550 = 11.85 even if you did buy a 550 version 11.85 TH I found also a menu were you can

Look what we have here! the source of single-board-test
 
the missing part ,  now we can compile own OPEN firmware! 
Bitmain just submited it!
@_date: 2017-04-29 08:10:48
Does not have these strings in single-board-test only listen to port 6060 witch is running at the local miner ip.
So there are clean versions of single-board-test
@_date: 2017-04-29 08:49:17
strings ./single-board-test | grep bm 
shows that bmminer is start after board test.
rebootTestNum=%d, start bmminer.
Start bmminer ...
/usr/bin/bmminer --version-file /usr/bin/compile_time --api-listen --default-config /config/bmminer.conf
looks like boardtest creates /config/bmminer.conf first and THEN starts bmminer.
so if we can take the boardtest of the firmware I posted and put it in the latest firmware we should be fine :)
Or use that older firmware I linked to and block auth.minerlink.com 
in /etc/hosts
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:15:15
Better to do this 
Alternatively, we advise owners of mining farms that run Antminers to set the DNS record on their routers of auth.minerlink.com to 127.0.0.1 in the /etc/hosts file by the following method:
It looks like in china is required by aw to build in backdoors!

found option to set base frequency see my posts.
550 = 11.85 TH 600 = 12.93 TH  650 = 14th
this is in the firmware were single-board-test does not call home.
so there is a older version that DOES NOT CALL HOME.
I use that version miners run fine blocked auth.minerlink.com 
in /etc/hosts
So my guess is that it authenticates to see what default frequency
you miner is soled , checks in database and then sets frequency.
this can be misused , but is also has a logic since bitmain sells.
different speeds separately!
 version does not call home
in single-board-test , and you can set base freq 
by selecting /cgi-bin/minerConfiguration1.cgi if you are loged in.

This version for the s9 has a single-board-test that does NOT have the URLS it only has the auth.minerlink.com but that can be blocked very easy by adding it to /etc/hosts and let it point to 127.0.0.1
@_date: 2017-04-26 12:16:24
Litecoin segwit wil activate very soon.
there is no Unlimited network so if they split they crash , node software has no strong developers community and support.
So BTC-u singnaling is not more then a ua=  :) 
also last core version supports blocks w/o segwit it basicly allows miner selection w/o chain breaking , core waits and just make things ready.
until a point everybody is fet up with it if they dont signal and core can then put a well USAF in its client , at that moment jihan can split the chain , what is very unlikely because buggy full node software , the jihan chain will have mining power but nu users :)
More likely is that segwit and asicboost will co exist on the chain , this is bacause of changes in 14.1 , then segwit loaded settelement blocks will have more transactions and more fee. and the miners that verify them will get more then the empty asicboost blocks.

600 = 12.93 TH and 550 = 11.85
even if you did buy a 550 version 11.85 TH 
I found also a menu were you can set voltage , but thats auto set by single-board-test so not needed to post.

could be very well they are REQUIRED BY CHINESE LAW.
so firmware for Chinese market has it "enabled"

Looks Bimain is required by Chinese law to do this.
Google is required by secret law to do the same! 
thats why we have open router software , and open phone software why not open miner software based on bitmain miners .. so bitmain can keep the law!
For now installing   has not this new code included  only old miner link backdoor.
but this can be fixed by pointing auth.minerlink.com to 127.0.0.1 in the /etc/hosts

"maths does not replace morality."
YES IT DOES ,, it was made for trade with people you dont need to trust , if you want a rope of 1 meter you KNOW you will get that expected size , morality is bullshit here 1 meter = 1 meter!
math is the basics of bitcoin , so it would be better to be pragmatic because pragmatic is tho only thing that counts in math!
Moral is a inter human thing for local use only , it cant scale , so you apply it afterwards and not as system wide variable! 
Moral is a human thing it does not count in math , math DOES not care about morality because you cant count it.
So I would focus on making layers above to make bitcoin anonymous so parties are clueless of what goes in and what goes out! , instead of wining about a lost case of morality!
Its the same problem when applying morality to security holes keeping them open because you can catch bad guys...
in math worlds the hole is open for EVERYONE! including the bad guys!
pragmatic is to fix them all , but morality blocks people from realizing that this problem can only be solved 
with pragmatic view because math == pragmatic

Its about the fact that the same address format is used... 
thats is misleading (you must be able to see as a nob what coin you are dealing with)
 and the source code is cloned from core , they only do paches don't develop.
2 things you need to have in a law if you make crypto currency legal tender.

"maths does not tell you what is right and wrong."
You say it your self now!  ,, it CANT so why bothering for morality in a system that is 100% math!
Morality you apply afterwards , money is also in moral , that's why we need a trustles form like Bitcoin!
Money cant be moral , because of its function! 
You can choose to spend it morally!!!
but that does not change to property of the money!
 
Math tells you a constant , like a comet coming to earth , you can calculate the path of the comet , or like Irma coming to florida you can calculate its path , you cant say "I don't want Irma to hit" that's immoral It DOES NOT HELP YOU! , its like fireing the wetter guy! 
This also goes for bitcoin and scaling.
Bitcoin is a transparent system , outcomes are known you can calculate them!
Its can be used for EVRYTHING :)
Good and bad are not constants , if you are for exaple on one of these islands were huricane visited is it bad to lute if your water and food is blown away?
Do you let your self die, for morality? 
Good and bad are very relative! , morals do have the same relativity!  
Math you can calculate outcome with a 100%  certainty , bitcoin is math.

BTC-e commented on Vinnik's charges
Short link
September 13, 2017, 17:49
The company BTC-e commented on the allegations made against the detained in Greece by Russian Alexander Vinnik.
"We want to report that on September 6, 2017, we learned from open sources about the officially launched accusations by the US government against our company and Alexander Vinnik. In this regard, the company BTC-e declares that since its inception it has been carrying out its activities within the requirements and norms of the legislation of those countries where it was registered. Citizen Alexander Vinnik is not its creator or owner, "- said in a statement of the company BTC-e, received in RT.
The company noted that from now on BTC-e will take all necessary measures to protect its employees and its business reputation.
On July 25, the Greek police detained a Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik on vacation, at the request of the American authorities. The US authorities brought him official charges, including in the laundering of the digital currency and the creation of a platform for illegal monetary transactions.
Lawyer Timofey Musatov told RT that the Council of Judges in Thessaloniki would decide on the extradition of Vinnik on September 29.

-7000 10 days ago yesterday -10.000 btc.
now price goes down when price restores they will make a new transaction 
142,203 left on the account , the good news btc has a limit of 21.000.000 so in the end they can only domp once :)

In the early days only CPU's were used.
then GPU's it slowly evolved to FPGA's now we have asics.
I would agree with you is POW was different on that chain , bit it is a retro chain of bitcoin , it has less features then bitcoin.
so less use cases except lower transaction costs but that does not help miners , if no profit people will not mine and that is why i dont worry , this chain (if ever split)  will implode exactly because of this.
for 0 fee you cant mine. and sw will be cheaper for users because of lightning but more expensive on main chain.
that's why miners will go for the higher fees on the btc main chain , on a busy day you can get 1/5 revenue  from transaction FEES ONLY!
Users don't realize that transaction fees are the lifeblood of the miners.
Bigger blocks on BCC chain means more space for fee less transactions.
that will kill the miners in the end.

Yes! finaly!

The current BIP91 epoch started at block 476112 (2017 July 16) and ends at block 476448 (~2017 July 19 02:00 GMT). As too many blocks failed to signal for BIP91 already in this epoch, BIP91 lock-in will not happen by block 476448.

 Idiotes and extremists destroy the world...
2x is part of the deal if BCC forks off they lost clearly control over it.
I would not be supprised  if they resolve this uncontroled situation  in a inside matter!
Bacause this made them lose face follow  who suspects Craig Steven Wright

well with BICC =&gt; BTC at 0.081 it does.
Thats why I say its a bad alt! :)
@_date: 2017-07-22 10:42:31
exact my point. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:07:37
**THIS IS NOT TRUE**
Bitcoin.com realesed a service anouncement...
Very clear , yes the 2MB done part of the deal . that's how the world works.
they are very cleatr that theyt dont belive in BCC them self . except as a option when NYA fails.

Bitcoin has a hard limit ETH has not.
Read this carfully  b4 you start to pump eth again ...
Every ICO created allows to create more ether , so it acts like reserve banking to make empty ICOs to creaste endless ETH....
so ETH is not rare like bitcoin.

if segwit SF is active changes are way bigger this HF will be smooth.

@_date: 2017-06-19 10:18:50
segwit + segrwit2x = segwit.
Same cade different ACTIVATION bit.
Reason POLITICS , but 2k is no longer a problem because of Malleability fixes in code!
and 2k will be very well tested , so will be acceptable the cheer and fear media makes a nice hype of it and evrybody will make money!
so everybody who can see it is happy :)
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:08:54
just see for your self what is needed.....
As a goldstandard BTC works very well.... :)
Stats and facts not bull and tabloite like storys.
so the ones who split it will have a very hard time.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:20:04
You will be suprised , only those who can read the code will
understand what will happen!

Badly informed people . scared...
keep your own keys NEVER TRUST A CASTODIAN who has your keys... noting to fear about aug 1.
but it IS important to keep the pressure , by running a USAF node!

This will avoid a chain split.
sw will activate b4 aug via bit 1 and 4
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:05:39
is colapsing so noe we gat the trols here?
the solution foward will nog be 2mb but this  
its only possible to do this  afther the segwit fixes!
why they would go for this because it allows asicboost on separate (driver)  chain.
and also miners for that chain can be soled by bitmain.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:37:33
can somody post the link used by the picture?

Endless need for growing in a world with finite resources is madness.
Bitcoin can stop this so people will be way less waste full with consuming.
@_date: 2017-06-19 12:43:49
Splitting cost more money then staying in 1 chain , but I can imagine they say somethings else because of emotional responding people dumping bitcoins , both sides can then crab some cheaper coins... :)
Thats just how tings work!
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:52:56
No split 2k will be instyalled by core evrybody , bc code changes that make 2k safe.
but only after good testing only mature code will activate is part of the NY agreement!
@_date: 2017-06-21 11:10:52
You dont need to store the witness part for long so makes it 2mb.

what a bull if you want to see the current use of the network check this link and no its not full at all !
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:20:22
FYI there is not a max cap on ether ever in circulation.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:56:13
(here you can see how busy the BTC network is) LIVE 
So if high BTC fees you do something very wrong now :)
Its not busy mempool is currently less then half full.
So if high fees someone could mining empty blocks.
See asic boost for more info. 
 explaining different uses for money.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:48:27
Its a different activation this is tested by EVERYONE.....
also core tested it , if they had found a bug it would be fixed.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:39:17
and here the whole history  you see then switch from BU to bip9!
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:58:39
The point is it get activated not HOW .... BIP 148 is good to keep the pressure on.
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:25:53
THE FIRST , who sloved the problem.
@_date: 2017-06-19 10:30:33


Well segwit fixes a lot of problems for a block increase and if the 2k will be activated it must be tested well I expect no split.
  
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:18:42
Very powerfull update but to abstract for most people.
but who cares! Segwit will activate!
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:23:07
Bit 1 and 4 do the same,,,  activate segwit so if everybode signals or bit 1 or bit 4 segwit will be activated!
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:25:23
this works well if other things are fixed first now segwit is comming this will be the case.

@_date: 2013-11-17 06:42:30
chna is buying who needs the pitty US State for its clean coins ....
 clean coins are a illusion! 
its like coke traces on dollar bills only worse because btc's can not be replaced , so all coins tainted for ever , in 24 hr , remember coins dont move only trades move , and 1 btc can hold 100.000.000 trades (owners) at one time , so chances are very big that 0.0000001 btc came form silkroad :) 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:23:52
Clean coins is a joke!
first point bitcoin dont move.
so the bitcoin stays the same all the time , this means that all bitcoin will be taint in no time!!!
There will be no clean bitcoins to replace the taint one's
so nobody who wants to loose will impose this.
The only reason if FUD , the only wapon the feds have to save the sinking dollar , by scaring the masses away from bitcoin!
Taint checks on coins is useless, because 1 btc can have 100.000.000 connected users , so what if 0.0000001 btc is used for silkroad , lol , well I guess you get the point.its worse then coke traces on dollars! , because btc's  cant be replaced!
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:02:14
96% of dollar bills are tanited with cocaine so this bitcoin white adress thing does not make any sense!

It is not true at all a russian or chineese or german bitcoin exchane would not care at all.
a axchane inecuador ieghter , you just mist the whole point of bitcoin.
Those US pople dont get it that the BRIC country are sick of them.. and WILL help snowden.
