Agree completely. However the real question is not how she moderated, but how did Craig got there? If that was a coincidence, than fine, but this is quite important as he was pretty unknown before. 
From zero to "hero" in a day, with nothing substantially relevant to Bitcoin to show but police in his house? Not so easy to believe it.

How so?

And how does  know him? You've just said she pitched him to you.

But not give up completely. We should at least show some respect &amp; support to open hardware.

My thoughts exactly. This is pretty obvious and makes me wonder about journalism, even if it's The Guardian. Can we (I mean, you) write them? :) One would think they would know how Bitcoin works and that old coins just didn't move, never ever.

So instead of people using multiple banks, they would now use just one (=Cashila)?

Double-spends ...
1. if i create two transactions offline, both spending the same coin, and push them to the network at the same time: will both be discarded as invalid or will (random) one be processed?
2. how are invalid transactions/block visible, how does  work?

Bitcoin ATM comparison? Or to put it simply: why would one buy Lamassu ATM instead of a 6x cheaper Skyhook?

How does nextblockhash get calculated?
I mean, using bitcoin-cli getblock xy, I can see nextblockhash, however I thought only previous block hash is included in a block? Do old blocks get updated with new data?

What companies?

Great work! BTW, how did you manage to get +100GB RAM? :)

Which means the node can be RPC queried just like a regular one, but with your stat extras on top, right? 
p.s. thanks for making it ;)

How much RAM did your bitcoind consume at maximum?
I am running v0.11.0 (intentionally not yet upgrading, will soon though) and after about a week of uninterrupted running, I'm already at 3+GB.

If I set up a Statoshi node, will I need to have a whole blockchain downloaded and having up-to-date? Thanks.
