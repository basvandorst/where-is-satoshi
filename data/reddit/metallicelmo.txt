Thank you for this clear answer, really helpful! I never heard about change addresses, this might also explain why my original bitcoin address shows -2  but it actually send 1 btc back to the wallet with that new address.
@_date: 2017-07-31 08:16:35
Ok, so I did not lose 1 btc to some unknown address? I was already ordering a pacemaker just in case... I will check the bitcoin core wallet this afternoon to see if all is oke

What software did you originally use? I would suggest downloading and installing that same version and try opening the wallet file with that, make a couple of backups first so you don't damage the original .dat file somehow

Does anyone know how to find your bitcoin address  private key in the older Bitcore Core wallets that dont have the help function or a terminal window?

So guys, what if I might have found the person who took my coins? What is the best approach for this?
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:28:14
thanks.. but if someone would be able to retrieve the password for my wallet(s) they would still need a copy of the actual .wallet file? How else would they be able to get in that wallet? Would that mean someone had access to my laptop somehow?

Yes but the blockchain says my BTC went straight to that address. And someone has that address listed as "his" BTC address to receive stuff.

Than the only option is my server at home (with firewall etc) or Dropbox (7zip file)... The only place I ever stored it (temporary) must have been stolen long time ago then.... DAMN, now I need my Jalapenos to generate new 
@_date: 2013-10-02 09:49:55
That's what I found but I don't want to wrongfully accuse somone who might not know anything about this.
@_date: 2013-10-02 09:54:04
As stated above If my wallet was stolen, this hacker could have paid someone else ( a legitimate person ) straight from my wallet..  but I still can't understand how they managed to get my wallet file, that makes me sleep bad. Double checked all systems, no virusses or anything.. Everything else still works, nothing strange there

Well I know i once stored BTC at Virturex and they shut down.. Got it all back, so I moved it all to an "offline" wallet on my laptop. Should be safe, made regular encrypted backups.. but still.. the transactions are now in the blockchain and all confirmed so it's gone.. But what I don't understand, do you need the .wallet file or the .key file to get into this wallet? did someone steal these files and got in using a keylogger that was on my laptop? how do they do this? I want to know how to prevent this in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-01 15:02:12
ok, but there should be some sort of keylogger, I still use this laptop, the Antivirus is ok, used multiple scanners.. :(
@_date: 2013-10-01 19:04:11
Ok I will.. I'll update the thead soon
@_date: 2013-10-05 19:15:47
Ok, but right now I have a key file and a wallet file and I don't seem to need the keyfile at all when I want to transfer my wallet to a new pc.. That would mean anyone who would steal the wallet file can do what they want with it.. Or do you need the key file to "authorize" outgoing transactions?
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:32:53
Yeah.. but I just lost 2000 dollars...
@_date: 2013-10-01 17:22:53
The private keys were generated by the client..

@_date: 2013-10-01 14:45:57
Yes, but what I'm trying to understand. If I had my .wallet and key on my local harddrive and there was a keylogger. Would you need these files to gain access to the wallet? In other words, did someone have access to the files on my laptop? If so I need to know If I need to change other passwords and format my drive.
@_date: 2013-10-01 14:33:56
Here is the blockchain.info link for the transaction.
@_date: 2013-10-05 18:29:45
I'm not sure, I can't test this cause my balance is now at 0.00.. maybe someone has the answer to this
@_date: 2013-10-05 13:02:57
Well, three weeks ago my .wallet file of both BTC and LTC on my pc were suddenly empty, they were not stored on a website.. I used Litecoin-QT (latest version) and MultiBit (Latest version)  I still have no idea what happened. They keep telling me I got hacked but my pc don't have any trojans or anything.. The passphrase was something that would not make any sense to anyone so nobody could have guessed it..

So I just found out that I downloaded cgminer 3.30 a while back from a link posted at Butterflylabs.com, it was a link to a different page, not related to BFL. MalwareBytes now says that cgminer.exe was infected with something called "Trojan.BitcoinMiner". Now it is a mining program, but am not sure if there is something more behind it (?)
