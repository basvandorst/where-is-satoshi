Get a loan
@_date: 2019-07-04 08:01:23
$10k next week.
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:16:56
I’ve never seen anyone jump higher to land on a conclusion.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:23:44
You may be right now lol
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:29:09
I don’t believe in diversity in crypto. All in. You either going to live on the street or in a mansion.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:31:45
Yes you just login to Pro and instantly deposit your Coinbase funds. I always access via desktop browser.
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:56:30
Who didn’t buy at $9.8k and now regrets it?
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:50:54
Does Coinbase Pro allow you to withdraw to a bc1 address? 
My withdrawals are failing.
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:43:06
Soo many weird candles lately....
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:10:26
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:30:22
Why did you sell here and not 12,13k lol
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:42:25
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:20:36
No you won’t
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:31:06
Bitcoin crashes to $5:
Reddit: This is incredibly healthy for the long term growth of the digital blockchain.
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:09:16
Maybe 14% of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:49:43
The top of the next bull run which could be after the halving.
(Was partly joking because it’s near impossible to predict the top)
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:46:46
Yea you could be right. Idk I just personally think the food is gross but I know people love it.
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:16:26
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:12:59
11k is gone forever.
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:55:42
Is it possible to see how much money is being printed monthly?
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:10:31
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:26:54
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:52:48
Thank you
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:20:10
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:30:25
Yea but we don’t know all his addresses. So how do we know he hasn’t sold?
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:51:21
9.2k prophecy should be the price to close the month.
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:14:45
Please take this to the police. Would be beautiful to see this guy arrested.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:54:22
Just here to ask why I didn’t buy more under $10k yesterday?
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:55:40
Not me
@_date: 2019-07-18 07:54:29
What happened to Fidelity?
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:48:56
Once your limit is it does it turn into market sale?
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:53:41
Lol you pissed you didn’t buy earlier
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:11:52
Is he still on Twitter?
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:44:07
Buy now or wait for a price that’ll never come?
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:46:09
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:05:27
Nah. Not selling until the next top. Yea, yea I know when the next top is.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:22:34
It’ll be the time when you have just enough to cop.
@_date: 2019-07-21 00:54:38
So did you sell? Back to $10.7
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:52:54
Lol you mad.
@_date: 2019-07-28 12:03:24
How is this even a debate?
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:41:05
Has anyone here actually gotten an IRS letter?
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:35:52
5 million by 2030 based on astrology
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:17:57
Who knows you’ll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:52:39
How in the world are they calculating 11% of Americans own Bitcoin? 1 in 10 Americans do not own bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:03:14
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:24:54
Nestle brought us nerds
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:56:19
Oh nice, nice.
@_date: 2019-07-20 11:17:14
Joe is so annoying
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:12:36
So long $10k, you’re gone forever.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:05:03
I really hope you’re joking with this comment.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:51:44
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:01:39
Lol you don’t buy crypto on binance, you exchange it. And Coinbase makes it easy for US already.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:16:37
Anyone feel like this little run today is a fake pump?
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:52:54
It will matter because that extra .1 BTC you could have gotten if you waited might be a small fortune.
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:26:17
Either wire transfer or use Cash App
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:07:14
This kinda funny.. respex.
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:56:55
Brave &gt; Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:02:23
Yes. Coinbase Pro is cheaper than both though
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:41:24
I’m asking in terms of risk management
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:29:31
This is great. I’m looking for sub $10k.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:04:02
Sub $10k come back just one more time, please?
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:18:40
Predictions like this are stupid but it’s so hard not to ask. I’m guilty.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:30:16
Facebook just has to slide some money under the table to a few key folks and they’ll be good to go.
@_date: 2019-07-04 08:25:19
Can’t stand that website
@_date: 2019-07-22 16:21:45
Yea but how many MAU?
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:48:14
It’s because these idiots are basically vegetables
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:53:01
Me to me at $13k: you should have bought more sub $10k you stupid shit 
Me to me at $9.5k: I think I’m going to wait to see if we goto $8500
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:27:16
The Cheeto broke!
@_date: 2019-07-01 09:00:11
Proof or fake.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:53:24
Rofl BSV
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:30:10
How would you programmatically send bitcoin? In a typical app you’ll send a request to a server, but how do you send a request to the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:26:51
It went under $10k like an hour ago lol
@_date: 2019-07-23 06:28:18
Welp. Here comes $9k.
@_date: 2019-07-05 17:31:23
What’s the safe buy now? $9k?
@_date: 2019-07-24 08:15:20
Who’s 100% invested?
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:56:33
What’s satoshis address with the most bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:22:59
It went below for a second
@_date: 2019-07-18 11:24:36
@_date: 2019-07-18 12:09:13
Back to the drawing board family.
@_date: 2019-07-14 23:33:41
Smh someone move the Cheeto, I want $9k.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:16:11
What’s full adoption?
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:54:35
Lol McDonald’s is horrible.. it’s like not even food.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:29:17
Diversity is overrated. Portfolio is 100% bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:03:31
Because if you go all in at $20k and then it drops to $10k you coulda doubled your holding...
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:15:00
How do we know Satoshi hasn’t moved his coins?
@_date: 2019-07-02 07:08:11
Yea, just don’t do that.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:21:09
Wow it’s happening
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:57:51
Pro doesn’t either, right?
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:14:41
He’s right
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:34:51
More like $9k
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:48:27
$10k then
@_date: 2019-07-18 07:14:35
I’m offended
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:14:49
Bitcoin will go up more.
@_date: 2019-07-18 04:57:13
@_date: 2019-07-02 18:14:50
Are we going lower than $9.8k?
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:21:42
@_date: 2019-07-03 06:34:03
You can’t look at the chart?
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:04:35
Clinging man!
@_date: 2019-07-02 00:48:11
Yea but the cheaper it gets the more you can buy.
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:35:24
Lol kinda funny
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:17:30
Check back at 4:30pm
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:24:20
How ma y days can we go down though before a pop? FOMO
@_date: 2019-07-17 16:13:07
Web browser
@_date: 2019-07-21 01:02:42
Right but if it hits your limit and the market immediately tanks?
@_date: 2019-07-02 04:05:27
Lol why would you do that?
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:07:03
Everybody knows this will be at 20k by the end of July
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:29:01
@_date: 2019-07-20 23:16:22
How much is to much to store in a single nano ledger?
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:28:10
Just a friendly reminder to manually insert your transaction fees when sending BTC. 1-2 sats per byte is good at the moment.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:40:54
True. Although FUD = buy, FOMO = sell.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:03:16
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:37:22
Might go back under $10k
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:34:42
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:21:47
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:09:19
Actually it has crashed several times....
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:20:31
I think so, be patient.
@_date: 2019-07-18 09:30:34
Damn so this was all fake news?
@_date: 2019-07-19 11:36:06
This is cancer
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:07:41
Congrats. Family is wealth.
@_date: 2019-11-01 12:12:41
How many times was this screenshoted?
@_date: 2019-11-02 11:38:23
@_date: 2019-11-01 12:08:52
What does it mean with these type of capital letters?
@_date: 2019-11-01 12:07:03
Is Bakkt volume increasing?
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:26:35
No it doesn’t.
@_date: 2019-10-11 05:29:35
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:17:47
Den dat*
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:00:41
Just buy at $11.4k ��
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:38:23
What is it?
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:24:51
Sell on Craigslist, meet buyer locally, get robbed.
@_date: 2019-08-17 05:08:36
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:28:41
Can we get an update now? Lol
@_date: 2019-10-19 10:13:11
Nope but many clowns did.
@_date: 2019-10-04 14:16:30
This is really not funny. At all.
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:05:14
Lol skyrocket? No.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:38:52
I’d die
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:18:36
Tell them to buy when you dump.
@_date: 2019-08-03 21:25:43
Sell off after ltc halving?
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:10:28
Good.. bitcoin needs a correction
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:33:38
Minimum $20
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:49:16
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:29:38
All we’ve been hearing for the last month is that when bitcoin hits $10k it’s going to fly...
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:25:29
But they keep talking about we’re all early.
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:21:36
$9k gone forever.
@_date: 2019-08-05 08:22:50
Sorry but from a food standpoint that sign doesn’t look appealing.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:15:04
Yea, scam!!
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:26:41
If bitcoin was worth zero you wouldn’t care
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:05:28
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:42:33
Nope. Under.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:44:22
Dumbest comment award ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:59:56
Health is wealth
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:16:07
I’m here because I believe. They are not...
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:32:42
Yea sell your coins and it’ll go back up
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:02:30
It happened for a good reason whether you see it or not. Take the good with the bad. Let’s go!!
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:03:12
Ima whale. AMA
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:29:55
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:08:10
Disable 2FA, use google Authenticator instead
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:03:27
Nah, just going to wait for the pullback that isn’t coming ��
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:37:53
Moral of the story don’t sell.
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:31:30
Coinbase pro,
Cash app, 
Cheapest to most expensive
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:39:36
Too early
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:09:56
How much do you earn being part of a pool. I know there are many factors, but is it profitable for beginners?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:50:06
Wait for $9k
@_date: 2019-06-23 11:37:11
What’s the point of having some of these companies on board like Spotify?
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:16:51
Lol wth
@_date: 2019-06-03 06:55:15
Let’s be real. This has no chance at being worth 1mil by 2021. Maybe in 10-20 years.
@_date: 2019-10-01 06:19:34
Nah because the lotto wouldn’t exist then.
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:13:52
Looks pretty cool. If you can remember, LMK if you like it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:01:46
@_date: 2019-06-11 09:57:51
Andreas = Satoshi
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:02:58
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:15:19
Assuming Satoshi is a single person, how do y’all imagine he/she looks?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:00:45
Probably will be a ton of profit taking at $20k as traders reminisce.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:13:08
All of all the cryptocurrencies the name “Bitcoin” is the best because it’s telling. Nobody would know wth a “Ethereum” is if they were t familiar with crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:29:04
So is he going to win this case?
@_date: 2019-06-09 04:00:24
Well I’m saying that if you’re a beginner you won’t have the scale of equipment...
@_date: 2019-06-01 11:18:24
Where’s the best place to sell it? I don’t want to do local as we don’t want to deal with people. Considering Apmex.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:53:03
Coinbase is most expensive. Cash app is cheaper than Coinbase. Coinbase Pro is the cheapest.
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:41:31
Before the last bitcoin is ever mined.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:40:11
What about now?
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:36:11
Alright correct now please
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:38:57
No, hardly a dip. Wait.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:53:11
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:28:52
Nope. Scam machine.
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:51:08
Man you sound like me.. salty you slept on $7k
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:20:49
Yes $4860
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:47:06
Come on $6k!
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:26:39
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:31:18
Come on $9k! You can do it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:37:38
This seems pointless
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:37:47
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:30:14
CMC iOS app is much cleaner than gecko
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:15:14
Dip, please.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:32:09
Lol at the amount of times someone has said this is the “turning point”
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:21:37
Because what if he turns out to be a criminal like Paul Le Roux. Or what if he dumps all his coins and we find out who he is, it would be a negative result.
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:06:08
Do you get paid?
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:56:54
What price you looking for fam?
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:29:04
That’s a pretty good take. I think you’re right. I hope we don’t find out who Satoshi is as much as I’d like to know.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:29:32
Cash app has less fees. Coinbase Pro is cheapest.
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:08:51
@_date: 2019-06-09 10:53:42
Looks like you need to rethink your friends.
@_date: 2019-06-03 06:44:07
I’m pretty sure Coinbase has reoccurring buys but I don’t think CBP does
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:40:33
@_date: 2019-06-16 19:43:43
It’s meaningless if most of them don’t care about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:09:49
Do y’all think &lt; $10k is gone forever?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:46:36
this is kind of spam my and invasive. Having this card in my face would annoy me. Just my opinion.
Good luck!
@_date: 2019-06-13 22:47:12
And when bitcoin is to expensive what do you do with your cash?
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:57:31
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:00:52
Deposit on to Coinbase. Once it clears, inside coinbase oro you can instantly deposit your coinbase money.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:17:14
&lt; $10k hopefully
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:53:34
Will it though because people are in alts to 10x+ their money..
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:49:17
No wait!!
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:31:09
If you sell your stocks bitcoin will tank. If you don’t sell your stocks bitcoin will moon.
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:35:25
A dip to $5000 would be sweet
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:18:30
Post the addresses?
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:28:18
Buy now or at 12k?!
@_date: 2019-10-23 10:33:59
Bitcoin: $7999...$8000.01
Me: $7k is gone forever
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:38:39
Well then we have nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:31:31
If bitcoin is at 10 million USD then the streets of America are littered with dollars like in Venezuala.
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:17:09
Wrong $850
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:59:14
Who doesn’t use JavaScript though?
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:55:42
Coinbase died!
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:22:51
Because of the graph increments
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:39:51
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:05:32
I’m glad cash app finally lets you get a total quote before having to deposit money.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:22:32
Eh .. or he’s dead or in prison imo
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:39:19
Buying at $9k
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:55:15
This is fact. I waited for $2500 when it was at $4k like a dumb sh1t.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:36:37
Yea nuts
@_date: 2019-06-14 05:56:01
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:38:26
Well 2FA sends your phone a code via text. People have reported they’ve been hacked by people calling the phone company and getting access to their info there. 
Google Authenticator works a little bit different. Check it out.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:27:02
Idk, was wondering the same?
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:36:47
@_date: 2019-06-15 22:24:20
@_date: 2019-06-30 07:38:56
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:32:59
So fake
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:58:08
So if CW really has the hard drive we will eventually find out who Satoshi is ��
@_date: 2019-06-03 07:13:52
Back to $7k?
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:52:48
Come 6,7,8,9k, I need more!
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:25:37
Gold has been flat for a while now though.
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:38:27
Under $7k soon.
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:28:30
Don’t believe in bitcoin or just too much of a gamble?
@_date: 2019-06-14 08:30:32
$20k was not a good time to buy.
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:27:40
When it hits 10k+ it’s going to start getting to expensive to buy a whole one for lots. $8500 won’t look bad then.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:09:07
Probably would sell off at the halving
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:19:55
I think so because there is too much on the horizon.
@_date: 2019-06-08 01:17:58
What a shit country
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:04:46
Please beat the warriors
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:28:15
What’s it matter? You should report anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:19:02
Yes! It’s absolutely worth it because you’re going to be more involved with learning about bitcoin and other crypto if you’re actually invested in it. You may not become a millionaire off your investment but knowledge is power.
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:48:42
Get a loan
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:28:02
Various reputable online dealers. Overnight shipping, next day payout.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:15:36
Wait what?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:41:16
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:23:11
Why does nano ledger live app show bitcoin at $9.7k usd? I changed providers and nothing.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:47:29
Do you guys like Gemini platform?
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:17:37
$5k* so I can reload, then $20k
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:55:59
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:33:33
Good. $1k please so I can load up ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:11:05
Nah waiting for $9k
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:26:57
Back to $8500
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:56:57
He’s a mad nocoiner.
@_date: 2019-06-24 09:48:43
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:57:10
Who’s selling at the top this go around?
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:50:41
These machines look like such a scam.
@_date: 2019-06-07 08:23:50
I agree with your expert analysis.
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:10:16
I’m trying to accumulate as much as I can under $10k
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:24:50
They kinda seem like boyfriends lol
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:28:47
It will moon and you’ll be kicking your granny for not going all in.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:08:42
Wow did he really say this?
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:42:49
Owned him.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:30:39
And if my place burns?
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:38:00
For those who were around to watch their bitcoin’s value plummet from $20k to $3k will you take profit next time around?
@_date: 2019-06-04 08:56:41
The Paul Le Roux story is so fascinating. Regardless though, Satoshi is either dead or in prison.
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:05:21
Lol people getting scammed by these lack common sense? It’s so obvious.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:23:41
It’s best if we never find out who really is Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-06 05:37:04
Buy a little now or wait a few days?
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:26:12
For less bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:23:48
Do you think satoshi is in prison or dead?
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:08:52
@_date: 2019-06-21 01:50:17
This a joke guys, calm down.
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:58:49
Would you guys recommend selling physical gold to buy bitcoin? Asking for a home girl.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:32:01
I did, just bought. Correcting for sure now.
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:49:36
Look out belowwwwww
@_date: 2019-06-11 06:14:22
Anyone else sad that nobody here will be alive the day the last bitcoin is mined?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:59:50
Well we did go $20k to $3k.
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:11:03
That’s an understatement
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:13:29
If bitcoin is further divided so Satoshi is no longer the smallest unit, what would the smallest unit be called? Nakamotos?
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:03:17
Is sub $10k gone forever and ever?
@_date: 2019-06-08 01:51:14
Cash app is cheaper than Coinbase and a little more expensive than Coinbase pro
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:09:56
What happened to his Twitter?
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:56:59
Right but I don’t have another house to hide it at. I did just pick up coldti though. Comes today.
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:34:55
He must be a bot
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:28:29
I think I’m the friend you’re talking about.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:24:47
Check back in a week at 7k ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:28:38
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:29:40
Watch some of the videos on YouTube on how bitcoin works. Then watch them again and again.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:26:08
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:07:51
Lol everyday there is a “this is it” moment
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:15:13
If you buy just don’t sell if it drops.
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:59:21
Literally did the same. Think Of dumping metals for BTC. Metals are so freaking boring man. The price doesn’t move.
@_date: 2019-06-11 09:44:29
Is the halving priced in?
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:46:44
At some point money is going to have to flow into alts.
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:59:58
Hope so
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:33:38
He made it made it?
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:21:16
Satoshis in jail...
@_date: 2019-06-14 03:05:52
Buy now or wait?
@_date: 2019-06-11 10:11:59
You forgot the parenthesis
($1000/$7) * $8000
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:20:54
Paul’s in jail.
@_date: 2019-06-09 04:00:48
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:36:03
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:51:57
Sell now
@_date: 2019-06-08 19:59:57
Lol I can do all of that. I actually built several instagrams with 200k+. Don’t get scammed
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:56:21
Should I buy at $9000 or $12000?
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:34:10
What’s the best way or place to store the 24 word ledger password phrase? Currently it’s on paper but if my apartment burns I’m toast.
What are y’all doing?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:53:43
Nobody knows
@_date: 2019-06-09 10:52:28
Yea no way they letting warriors lose
@_date: 2019-06-08 16:10:52
Come on man, really?
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:27:26
The reason is because we’re going back to $9k
@_date: 2019-06-02 04:55:03
How does that happen? Surely there are enough 7xxx, 6xxx, etc orders in place?
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:20:05
Anything that has western union on it I immediately think it’s a scam.
@_date: 2019-06-21 07:57:19
Buy now or wait?
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:36:05
@_date: 2019-06-19 10:51:53
It’s cheaper than Coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:18:13
Plot twist: OP is scammer trying to get us to visit the link.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:28:14
Agreed nobody trust mark anyway
@_date: 2019-12-31 11:45:03
So true. I honestly don’t think we’ll pump for a long time.
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:19:35
Buy now or at 1 million?
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:44:08
How would he crack it? Just try every combination possible? Thought that would take hundred of years?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:52:08
I’m not opposed to a sign but it’s just the way it’s presented that could have a reverse physiological effect on passengers. I do sincerely wish you good luck though.

Civic &gt; BMW
@_date: 2019-06-15 11:32:43
Each halving becomes less significant. I think money will flow into bitcoin after the lite coin halving.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:22:45
If you had 20 ounces of gold coins would you dump them ASAP and put it in bitcoin right now?
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:20:38
There are a few interesting theories
@_date: 2019-06-18 07:47:48
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:14:04
Absolutely not moon boy.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:17:42
Pm sent
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:22:54
What kind of idiot deposits money in an exchange nobodies heard of? All it takes is common sense to stay safe. Sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:24:09
Be a G and do it anyway.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:47:28

Then when you get rich you’ll wish you were young.
@_date: 2019-08-02 12:41:28
Lucky guess nothing more.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:22:06
Parents don’t know best! Parents often prevent their kids from doing great things because they don’t understand.
If you have the cash then get someone else to buy for you and give them the money.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:56:17
Wtf.. just hold it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:12:13
 Coinbase
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:08:19
$7k gone forever lol
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:35:32
We literally just dipped into $9k range on CBPRO so what are you saying?
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:49:27
Sorry what was that? $9.8k
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:56:38
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:06:25
Nobody cares tbh
@_date: 2019-09-21 08:42:28
It’s not like we can do anything about it. Best just to worry about things we can control.
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:13:12
Luck streak ends in October!
@_date: 2019-09-29 05:30:13
Nah lost $1.2m this week.
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:57:15
This is what Andreas said...
@_date: 2019-09-21 04:58:15
Looking like 9k again
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:49:35
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:23:26
Lol it’s so cringy that people still do that.  Guys probably 30 too lol
@_date: 2019-09-28 10:36:10
$7k gone forever.
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:48:58
Lol you mad. Please tell me exactly what I can do right now to stop the print press?
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:14:18
Hold on. We’re going bakkt.
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:41:32
Judging by the charts, nobody responded.
@_date: 2019-09-01 05:56:13
Prayers to you ��
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:56:24
@_date: 2019-09-02 08:42:08
Idk about 1 million
@_date: 2019-09-30 13:13:27
Everyone would be a trader if we could tell the future.

@_date: 2019-09-25 07:48:50
@_date: 2019-09-22 08:26:03
I think the moisture will ruin the wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-11 00:42:36
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:55:48
Lolz... you had no idea prior to buying that it could potentially drop?
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:58:49
That double pay for a job you hate isn’t worth it. Congrats!
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:29:06
This is big
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:49:12
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:13:47
Until BlockFi disappear into thin air.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:53:08
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:00:04
Cash out and buy at 10.4k
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:22:41
Save your seed on a metal plate?
@_date: 2019-09-01 04:15:43
Then you have millionaires battling depression to the point of suicide. Health is wealth. Family too.
@_date: 2019-09-27 04:31:17
How do we check volume?
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:46:56
BUY when things are looking down. Don’t buy when the rally starts.
I just bought some.
@_date: 2019-09-23 09:13:43
@_date: 2019-09-06 12:29:15

@_date: 2019-09-22 05:34:38
Back to $10k soon
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:07:01
Borrow a loan from the bank, buy bitcoin, buy car?
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:17:04
Prove this run isn’t due to manipulation.
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:14:52
I agree. 90% bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-16 03:58:49
Might do that
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:29:44
It’s not until the price moves that you realize you f’d up
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:35:58
When you sell on something like Coinbase it can be tracked.
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:07:17
Reminder I didn’t buy 3 years ago
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:57:38
Reddit is full of people that aren’t funny trying to be funny.
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:07:58
$5k soon
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:30:09
Yea but most of the bitcoins have already been mined. Each halving becomes less significant.
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:19:06
Maybe Satoshi lost his private key and that’s why he hasn’t surfaced. Saving self from embarrassment.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:56:40
Well the goal would be to increase adoption rather than stay stagnant.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:50:28
BECAREFUL! Everyone in the world thinks this is the next major bull run, maybe it is, but be fearful when others are greedy.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:46:31
@_date: 2019-05-30 11:21:37
What are the advantages to this as opposed to immediately converting your paycheck to crypto?
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:59:31
Is the upcoming halving being blown way out of proportion?
@_date: 2019-05-15 10:31:48
I only invest recklessly
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:08:53
What’s Satoshi’s bitcoin address? Going to send him a money request.
@_date: 2019-05-16 02:43:10
Buy now or wait for dip?
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:39:07
Yo I would lmaoooo so hard if trump was Satoshi
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:08:20
Thank you no-coiner.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:29:48
I found Satoshi!
@_date: 2019-05-23 07:12:43
So are we going to dip below $7k?
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:20:40
I own one bitcoin block.
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:08:45
Facts! I need to work.
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:03:15
@_date: 2019-05-28 05:16:37
Buy now or wait?
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:50:27
No. eBay sucks. Can’t wait for that company to die.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:42:53
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:11:31
He’s made like 1 deal in the history of the show. I feel like the guy doesn’t know anything.
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:31:44
Are we going higher or are we going lower?
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:00:56
If I had a bitcoin for every time I heard someone say this you guys wouldn’t have any bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:38:08
I said “look”. They just seem sketchy to a no-coiner.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:23:11
Manipulated. Take profits and buy back cheaper.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:13:28
Waiting for pullback... 
@_date: 2019-05-19 05:14:58
Ledger Live doesn’t show real-time balance?
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:56:39
On eBay yea. So many chargebacks from scammers
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:03:22
Are you out of your mind? They’re not going extinct...
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:36:26
Huh? You can withdraw BTC from Cash App.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:16:27
It’s too hard to secure your coins for the average person. Imagine explaining to your grandma that she can’t lose her keys or share them with anyone.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:46:11
Eh idk about that
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:31:05
Thanks fam!
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:45:04
.kyc ?
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:13:20
If miners mine a block they are granted new bitcoins. About every 4 years the amount of new bitcoins granted for a mined block halves.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:12:00
This is an actual photo of me. Please credit me.
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:19:34
You should be reporting anyway so wth does it matter?
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:15:41
Paul Le Roux = Satoshi Nakamoto? ��
