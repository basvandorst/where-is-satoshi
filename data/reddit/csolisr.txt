Long story short: keep your cryptocurrencies on devices you can trust, and if you need to exchange them, return them to your devices as soon as possible. Online wallets are not under your control (unless you're literally hosting a server in your house).

Actually, whenever there's a functionality only available through non-free software, it's completely stripped from operative systems endorsed by the FSF. Not only Replicant, but also their endorsed desktop GNU+Linux operative systems (Trisquel, Parabola, Ututo and others). In the case of Replicant, that means that there's no WiFi, GPU, Bluetooth or GPS in most supported models.

You could have saved licensing money and added extra freedom by basing your LiveCD on Trisquel GNU/Linux-libre, the FSF-approved fork of Ubuntu that includes 0% non-free software or drivers.

For the uninitiated, the tulip fiasco (also known as the bulb craze) was a hype that occurred in the Netherlands (where else?) where the aforementioned flowers increased in value (thanks to, among other things, a virus that caused rare color patterns in tulips without killing them), spurring speculation of this flower to the point where one single tulip bulb could be traded by a state's worth of land.

1. Nobody can truly determine the code running in those servers right now. This can perfectly mean that their servers are either compromised or intentionally tainted, making the users prone to scamming.
2. Depending on a server that one can't run elsewhere in case of having to elope is a bad idea. Especially if your savings are within it. One might use an old version of Blockchain.info in an alternate server, call it a fork and keep it going, but if for any reason the binary format for private keys is no longer compatible with the free version, then nothing can be done to escape.
3. Bitcoin is designed to decentralize the possession of currency. Depending on a single server for this runs counter to the purpose of the currency.

As far as I've heard, transaction fees are planned to be lowered as well. What will happen when said fees drop to zero *and* mining stops being profitable? Would that mean the end of Bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:05:18
What I mean is that, eventually, auditing will no longer be profitable, not even with transaction fees. What happens then? Will the Bitcoin transactions automatically paralyze without miners/auditors?
@_date: 2013-08-20 04:44:03
Also, independent miners (the "unknown" part in the chart) are currently the second largest mining force, and may eventually take first place. Centralization will be history pretty soon, it seems!

Open-source projects based on a closed-source platform, which can't be ported to other platforms.


Good point there, but in Android one can install alternate stores, very especially [one solely composed by free software.](


Not even Ubuntu is safe anymore, but there are Android and GNU/Linux distributions available that make more for your own freedom, for example Trisquel GNU/Linux in the desktop, and the Replicant project and stock CyanogenMod in mobile.


As is Nokia, etcetera. At least in Android one can just flash an open-source OS in most devices and wave goodbye to said issues, something that can't happen with Nokia or Apple (but definitely can with Samsung as CM and Replicant have proven).

There's no denial that crimes can be committed both with cash and Bitcoin. Unfortunately, the latter is more apt for criminal exchanges (and thus more feared by the police) because of several reasons:
- Bitcoin is even more private than cash, since it doesn't require personal interaction to make an exchange. Usual money either requires an identification (credit/debit cards, wire transfer, PayPal/Amazon/etc.), or personal exchange of physical tokens (cash). Given a digital money launderer or enough caution with the transfer addresses, Bitcoin is technically anonymous.
- Bitcoin is a digital good that's not issued by a government or organization and is only indirectly correlated with government-issued cash. Thus, it can't be legally seized as easily as cash since there's little or no legal framework for such a novel concept of value.
- Bitcoin is based on cryptographic systems that make it hard for a government to seize the money, unless they get their hands on the private key. With a sufficiently secure system, the government can't touch a single Satoshi, whereas a safe vault can be opened with slightly less effort.

But, as with any emerging idea, it solved the issue only for a section of the human population on its beginning. Esperanto was meant as a common language for Europe, and its Eurocentric vocabulary attests it. However, a very fervent group of Esperantists claimed boldly (to date even) that such a language is also apt for the whole humanity in its current state. Later reforms (such as Ido) tried to solve some grammatical deficiencies, but failed, not only because of that fervent group, but also because they didn't solve the core problem of lack of internationalization.

Fact: To transfer 0.5 BTC (around $50) you'd need about 0.0005 BTC (around five cents) in transaction fees. Assuming that both sender and receiver can spend their Bitcoins without transferring them to another currency, the price is unbeatable.

If it weren't for the premining, I'd say that Novacoin is the safest cryptocoin in existence. Scrypt mining (from Litecoin) plus a proof of stake (from PPCoin). If there were a way for Bitcoin to adopt those without wrecking the blockchain, then the devs should.

That's awesome, thank you! However, there are a few issues with the methods of payment they provide:
- PayPal might mean a permaban if they find out that I'm using it to sell BTC.
- OKPay and Perfect Money need me to verify my account to send or receive money. It was OKPay that asked me to pay for a certified translation of my ID card.
- Western Union might work, but I'd need to set an account in one of their physical local stores first. Also, I might or might not get a permaban if I use it for Bitcoins, can anyone verify this?
- Local trade... That might work, yes. If I just had a good excuse to get out of my house during a weekend. Hopefully I can find one that accepts depositing straight to my bank account (my wallet is kept safe at home and I can't just bring the whole desktop computer elsewhere to make a trade).
