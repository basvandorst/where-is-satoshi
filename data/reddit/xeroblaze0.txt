I was asking you for the link from Coinbase, unless you meant Coindesk.
This is the most recent thing (at the moment) regarding their address change to a PO box.

Is it their machine?
@_date: 2014-02-19 12:11:53
I meant in the sense of a "business front" rather than an actual box.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:30:41
Fucking this

This was the only one I knew about. Eventually I'll make my way over there for an empanada or four

This was in Merchandise Mart. Am I late on the ball because I feel like I should've known about this. It wasn't on the map the last time I checked, and frankly Chicago has been somewhat disappointing in adoption (though the conference was a nice touch, if expensive).

I'm not seeing it addressed in the first comments, but regarding the first first issue; the way the current system is, merchants still have to wait on credit card companies to verify transactions. That could possibly take days or weeks. The blockchain allows verification to be done in minutes. If you mean just the notification of the transaction, that takes seconds (maybe a minute or two), while cards take a bit longer, especially if it's a weekend.
1.2 - That will come in time, but paper wallets seem to address that at the moment
1.3 - I would have the same reaction with U.S. Bank, or any other malevolent financial institution
1.4 - Purchase agreements...

They really know how to deliver the details.

As I mentioned, I was very surprised to see it, hence the post. I'd love for Chicago to get on the ball with bitcoin but I've been disappointed so far. Cities like Boston or London I imagine get old to hear about.

The point of this though is for bank to bank settlements, not everyone's day-to-day transactions. The information logged should be several times smaller. And even then hopefully they have it decentralized between banks.

why not both?
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:07:46
Which coins do they support. Their website doesn't mention anything.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:44:40
What's happening on the 3rd?
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:20:35
aw fuck, I've myself.
*Just* Bitcoin then.

As mentioned above without much clarity to the layman, [this](
It's a movement that people withdraw their coins from exchanges as sort of a trust fall?
I think it's akin to everyone demanding their money from the bank in an attempt to prove their ledger, which would cause the bank to fail. Bank use that money to loan out, which they get back with interest, which you see in your own savings account as the savings rate. Exchanges however shouldn't fail because they shouldn't be lending out money. Exchanges aren't banks.
