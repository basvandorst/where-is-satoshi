This is exactly how I feel to. Plus, I didn't exactly spend 4 years dicking around, I mean I went to a pretty nice University and got a Physics Degree. Paying back the feds with money made from Crypto is so satisfying!
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:39:54
Thanks! I wish I still felt young! Oh I miss college so much already... even if it cost me so much.

No I went home and sold off about 30% of my initial investment in USD for what turned to only be like~18% of my BTC, which covered 2 loan payments (initial investment was a bit more than one loan payment). So I killed two payments with one essentially haha

Doing the same thing here. There's a nice feeling paying off my debt to federal government, with money made from a cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:38:55
It's a miracle
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:20:17
Well you also have a Prophet saving the masses during an exodus. As a Jew I give it a stamp of approval. Perhaps not intended, it's still relevant. Also, Christians still rock the Old Testament. 
Edit: Likely all BTC rants involve being "freed" from the slavery of "fiat", or the global bondage of the banking system. Then you have the oppressive force, little SEC men and Mad Money deniers, close on their heels. Then the miracle of blockchain tech, parting of the seas. Pic is Close enough for this Jew.

That's a very stable thing to say. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:57:02
So many Newports lol
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:00:56
I feel special now.

I've stopped trying to understand others at some level. There are people on Reddit claiming the earth is flat... On the internet... many from cell phones bouncing signals of satellites orbiting the planet.  When you examine your own mind closely it's hard to know why we feel and think the things we do, so trying to understand such outlandish ideas in the minds of others is likely a lost cause.

I'll buy that dip.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:14
Haha that's even better
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:03:41
Well that got weird. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:46:43
For some reason I'm imagining the voice of BTC being identical to the 'Member Berries from South Park. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 23:55:15
And if it hurts too much you can be treated [free of charge]( 
I guess it comes down to what you value. As someone living in the US with many arguably invaluable resources like education, healthcare and public transportation being horrendous I imagine I would find more value per tax dollar in a society that puts it towards greater equanimity than billions towards wars thousands of miles away. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:38:57
Yeah, plus like people avoiding capital restrictions or lesser financial crimes in repressive countries. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:31:38
That's what I was thinking. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:37:54
Sure. Again, it's not about a value judgement on Bitcoin. I'm just curious about what people think the number is. I mostly agree with that estimate as well. Although, there are technically a lot of different crimes that could be facilitated by bitcoin. 
Considering Money laundering and drug activity alone, estimates say [~500 Billion]( global market cap on drugs and [2-5%]( of global GDP going into money laundering annually... that something like 10% of global GDP per yer. But consider illegal arms sales, services, other goods like counterfeits. It does start to add up.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:28
...That you can remember. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:10:19
That's not what I said. My first exposure to Bitcoin was through seeing the Silk Road. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:32:37
That's what I'm thinking. I only think this is a good idea, in the sense that I think most people are quite stupid. This is obviously a terrible application of Bitcoin, but more familiar for many. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:38:23
Best answer
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:26:47
Maybe so, maybe not. Doesn't really change or relate to my question.  Are you trying to say Silk Road purchases aren't illicit in nature? I don't follow. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 10:33:07
Haha I did this for a while, until the guy at the smoke shop said "Don't spend that shit bro, HODL". 
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:27:11
I wonder if the US Gov't is buying Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:44:13
Looking forward to the second half. "**BANGALORES**, [***Bring out some Bangalores!***]( ***"***
F.U.D. be Damned.

Official Stance : Coinbase is trying to slowdown/prevent crypto jacking. 
My Fear: They want to slow down the withdrawal to maybe have you change your mind, or
give them the time to get together the coin your account holds.
