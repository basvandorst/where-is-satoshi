Nice article. I would’ve liked to hear more about the amount he was making and how much it is supplementing his salary. 
Thanks for sharing.

 It’s not a currency. Don’t get confused. 
A currency is controlled by the central bank of a country. 
Bitcoin is largely controlled by 1) miners in China and Russia who effectively set the rates and 2) early adopting whales with a huge proportion of the wealth. 
It’s not decentralised, most people don’t use it for transactions, and most of the wealth is concentrated on the hands of the few, not the many.

'Currency is what people prefer to use and control' - WRONG
Currency is what most people actually use.  Do most people 'use' bitcoin?  Is bitcoin in circulation anywhere?
