Keys - private key is ideally a random number. Public key is mathematically generated from it. Address is generated from public key. It is easy for computers to calculate forward from private key to public key to address. It is theoretically impossible to do in reverse from address to pub key to private key.
Wallets primarily store private keys. You don't necessarily need to worry about creating addresses and stuff, good wallets do that on the fly. Bitcoin can be sent to an address and only user who controls the private key for the public key from which that address was created can sign a transaction authorizing spending of the coins.

One theory is that Blockstream does not want larger blocks because they need to make good on their VC funding and create a layer 2 product which they can then monetize. Blockstream's argument is that this theory is false and they don't want bigger blocks to prevent centralization. Bigger blocks are more expensive to process and store which can price out some people.

Coinbase is [not a wallet]( or exchange. GDAX is the exchange. In most cases you don't need the full client with 100GB. They are quite safe to use, and some people like them, so if space is the only issue you can run it in pruned mode, say 1GB max. There are other options for lightweight mobile clients or desktop ones like jaxx, exodus, electrum, multibit, etc. They are trustworthy to a point.

Coinbase and LibertyX are vendors for buying (or selling). Use them only for that purpose. If you use Coinbase to receive funds they will track it reducing your privacy. Addresses are not public keys. They are generated from public keys. Use a new address each time. Let the app manage the addresses for you. Remember to set up AND test the backup feature of the wallet so you can restore access to coins in case phone is lost or stolen.
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:50:29

Providing bank password is always a bad idea. It's probably against your bank's terms or something, i.e. if you do it they are off the hook if your money disappears. At the very least change the password immediately after verifying the account. Exchanges do not need the password after verification, only to confirm you are the owner of the account you linked.

It is not necessary to save public key or the address.
Paper is for long term storage and HW wallets are for usage. Hardware wallets allow for secure signing of transactions without signing keys being exposed. They are always in the chip on that device. With paper-wallet the private key is not on internet connected device for majority of its life, but you have to import the private key into something to use it, either a smartphone or desktop wallet, which could be infected with cryptocurrency stealing malware.

Automation destroys simple jobs. Horse buggy whip makers had to adapt. Certainly there are a lot of people who need to make a living. I don't have a solution, but not sold on UBI.
UBI might work. I'll be happy to be a recipient if it does, though I'd be for means testing and people like me shouldn't quality. It could also bring on the undesirable effect some people mention - creating masses of lazy moochers who blow through the handout and beg or demand more anyways.

This fee is determined by the data size of the transaction. You are using lots of small inputs. As others said you might be able to combine them with 2 or 3 economic but long to confirm transactions. It will still cost you because all that junk has to be stored by the network. If you don't want to pay visible fees pay hidden ones by using a credit card.

No miners and nodes did not matter here. It's literally people heading for the exits. They couldn't withdraw BTC so they dumped it to get cny out. As price moves in one direction or another it tends to get stabilized by arbitragers over time. Traders on other exchanges sold too, triggering stop loss orders which sold deeper still.
Not sure why you'd say trust is important in a decentralized system. Precisely the opposite - you don't have to trust any one entity, or anyone. The system works best for those who operate in their self interest. Cheaters and attackers lose money.

When I see suggestions to hodl for 5, 10, 20 years, I wonder if the person making them is over 15 years old. Things change fast and the rate of change seems to increase.

Bitfinex order book for USD loans. People can borrow or lend USD to buy or sell on margin. The offers are listed by interest rate per day. If you had USD in bitfinex you could lend it for ~0.026% per day or 9.49% per year. This rate can fluctuate with demand. Sometimes it's quite high, reaching 75% or even 100% per year but the demand never lasts so long as to actually pay out that much. Loans expire and unless you offer lower rate your loan will never get renewed.
@_date: 2017-02-16 10:46:31
Are you buying or selling? If you are buying you should be fine. If you sell you owe tax on capital gains. It's 20% if you held bitcoin for more than 1 year before selling and regular rate of your tax brackets if held less than one year. If you are transacting regularly to capture a profit you are a money transmitter and need a license. That's my understanding, but there are detailed web sites about taxes out there already.

Bitcoin is not for the "other 4 billion," or the "unbanked." That's a marketing ploy to excite those who understand basic econ topic of supply and demand effect on price, but don't understand the bitcoin tech limitations.
Today bitcoin is for people with enough time to research it and enough money to buy it. The rest can use an altcoin if they want the benefits without the costs.

Yes the tax is on realized gains. If you hold the investment which appreciated in value those are unrealized or paper gains.
Note that technically any transaction can result in taxable event, not just selling BTC directly for cash. If you paid for coffee, or for a car with BTC - taxable events. If you bought dash coin with it - same. You have to pay tax on the profit. But then you may be able to deduct up to $3000 per year in losses when your dash coin tanks.

You are speaking about micropayments. Bitcoin cannot do that. There are minimums, look up dust, plus minimum transaction fee is 0.00001 for the network to even propagate it.
You might be able to use a shitcoin like doge or digibyte.
Or use off chain third party service like changetip which I think shut down. There is risk since 3rd party could get hacked or could run with deposits.

@_date: 2017-03-16 18:08:23
0conf was never safe. Couple seconds or couple minutes, doesn't matter.
Not everyone has the same priorities. 0.0005 will get your average size transaction into next 1 or 2 blocks. If you are just shuffling coins between wallets and delay does not matter then 0.0001 will take a while but probably will not be dropped. Anything paying less than that deserves to be dropped.

It's the same sender splitting up a big chunky balance. So no, there is no massive movement, just "makin' it rain" for miners in transaction fees. Paying about $2 fee for each split. I suppose they could REALLY need many addresses with small balances very soon. But they could have used a "send to many" to create many addresses with just one transaction, so that's probably not it. So they are filling up the mempools for whatever reasons, or they are messing with fee estimation algorithms for everyone. I'd say they are free to do this, it's their money, but it looks a bit suspicious.

Plenty of speculative demand still exists I guess. Certainly some utility is needed and it's still there even at $7 per tx or whatever.

Miners like profit so they usually mine the highest fee transactions first. Assuming that Alice's transaction pays a fat fee almost every miner is mining it. If it pays shit nobody is mining it, it's waiting in the queue until all higher paying transactions are mined. Mining is not done on blocks technically since blocks don't exist until they are mined. It is a matter of luck which miner solves it but of course the larger the miner the more hashes they make and more chances they get.

I recommend selling 25% of the airdropped coin for the best price you can get. People DO NOT value things they get for free, so they will sell. A few big names publicly stated their plan to sell as well. In short term the price is going to take a big hit.
While there are supporters of bitcoin cash out there, money runs the world. If miners face a dilemma of mining blocks paying $35k vs blocks paying $1500 they may have to make an unpopular choice and stop mining bitcoin cash. Chain that isn't mined will go through its difficulty adjustments and will be viable even with a few terahash supporting it, but it will NOT be safe to use. That would put even further pressure for users and miners to abandon it. If you sell 25% you'd get something out of it vs blind holding and losing it all. If it takes off you're still sitting on 75%!
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:46:49
Network is busy right now. Miners sell block space auction style. Everybody is trying to outbid each other in fees to get their transaction through.  Whatever algorithm coinbase nodes use, they can detect that fees are quite high for some blocks and are adjusted accordingly.

No. If people continue to send more than 1MB of transactions paying more than you it might never confirm in which case it will eventually be dropped from mempools and you can then resend it. Usually though  new transactions die down and progressively lower fee ones get mined.

Transactions per second is not meaningful. Size of the data to mine into blocks is what matters. With 40 MB in pending transactions right now the wait is 6.7 hours. But, higher transaction fee will entice the miners to include it sooner.

Some things jumped out as incorrect right away. I could probably read the whole thing but not now.
"A new ‘block’ is added to the ‘chain’, every time a new transaction takes place on a particular asset" - new block is not added for every transaction.
"The information chain (with time-stamped blocks) is encrypted – and no single user can modify or delete or tamper" - blockchain data is not encrypted.
"Bitcoin transactions are completely anonymous" - nope.
"The distributed ledger of blockchains is periodically edited by checking the available balances at different ‘Bitcoin addresses’. All bitcoin transactions are checked at intervals of ten minutes by ‘bitcoin miners’" - blockchain cannot be edited, that's the point. Only unconfirmed transactions are mined by miners, not "all." Once done they are not mined again.

The more miners move in the higher the difficulty will rise. The current price is too low to support miners. Then we have poloniex b-cash release = dump.

No, coinbase security is quite good, probably better than yours. It's bad to leave coins there because you don't control the keys. In an unlikely event CB gets hacked you don't have much recourse. They can also freeze or seize your funds if ordered by government or whatnot.
You may want to send it all from coinbase to an address in your copay wallet. But first, you MUST have a backup securely stored outside your main place of residence.

Wall of text.
You are confusing addresses and public keys a lot. They are not the same. Yes, you can restore your wallet from seed. Electrum created a lot of private keys from seed, public keys from private keys, and addresses from public keys. You can send btc to any of the addresses you see in the wallet. Key corresponds to one address. Seed corresponds to all of them. You should generally never need the seed other than for recovery. It must be securely backed up and not entered on various other devices. Make separate wallet on other devices. If any of your wallets are compromised at least you won't lose everything at once. See bitcoin wiki for tech info. Bitcoin can change. Paper wallets are nice for long term storage but not easy to spend - you will have to scan it into a phone or desktop wallet and that's where the risk of exposing keys returns. Best for spending are hardware wallets, ledger, trezor, keepkey. Bitcoin is not a good option for retail. 2nd layer solutions running on top of bitcoin may eliminate the 10 minute wait time. Wouldn't worry about key collision. Paper wallets are best swept and discarded. That will import entire contents of it into the smartphone or desktop wallet. They can be added to many times but spent from only once (there are ways to send separate inputs, a little more nuanced). As an example, you have 2 btc paper wallet, you import into phone wallet, you spend 1 btc on something. 1 goes to the vendor and 1 goes to a change address in the phone wallet. You might think 1 remains in paper wallet, but it doesn't. So don't clear the phone wallet; create new paper wallet if desired and send the 1btc change to it from the phone.

This has nothing to do with liquidity. If you cut a pizza into 8 slices or 100 million slices you do not end up with more pizza.
Liquidity refers to markets. The price of btc is literally the price at which the last trade happened. Fiat liquidity is required such that if a miner decides to sell 1000 BTC there needs to be enough fiat orders to absorb it. At the moment selling 1000 BTC on bitfinex would drop the price there by about $7. The drop could be even more as stop loss orders and margin calls are triggered on the way down. And remember there are many traders, not just one seller of 1000 BTC. They too may want to sell at the same time.
Likewise BTC liquidity is needed if someone really wanted to buy thousands of BTC at once. Buying 1000 BTC on bitfinex would raise the price by $83! Bitcoin's 21 million coin limit ensures that at some point supply of bitcoin will stop growing. If demand keeps growing the only way for those wanting BTC would be to pay more and more for each one. Many idiots and a few smart people are saying BTC price could reach $500k per coin. That is if all goes well.

What's the point of paper wallet if you allow first two? Once key is in the wallet it's been exposed to the wallet, os, all apps. Key on paper is so that it's not touching internet connected devices. Don't implement that. Paper wallets need to remain spend-once only.

Be sure to also note the trading volume. It is easy to create a coin with billions of units which will give it a high cap even with low price. You could singlehandedly bump the cap but then you'd be a sour bagholder with no one to sell to.

1. Yes. You should not do that. The transaction fee goes to miners which check and confirm it. Fees are rather high at the moment based on network capacity demand.
2. Yes fee will be higher but not 3x necessarily. Also, the fee will be the same if your single address had 3 separate deposits made into it. Transactions sent to the same address are not combined in it, they are stored as separate inputs. You should avoid reusing addresses since there is no saving on fees and increases privacy.

Number of units times price per unit. In cryptocurrency space it's not a very useful metric.

Block reward will be roughly equal to current fees per block in 2 halvings. That's 5-6 years from now. Miners will compete for blocks fattened up with fees rather than empties with just the block reward. That is unless the whole structure of how transactions work changes to lightning, more off-chain, or whatever else. Hard to to predict where BTC will be then.

The thing with chart patterns is that there are enough people using them that it becomes self-fulfilling. You see that rendomly drawn triangle? Well the price just went way up above it. Which signals to everyone who's following this crap to buy because the price will now go up higher. So they all buy, and guess what the result of increased buying is? The price goes up.

Your fee is 221 sats/byte. Good fee at the moment is in 350+ range. You don't need to worry, the transaction will eventually confirm when demand for block space drops to your fee level. In worst case the transaction will drop out of mempools in a few days and you will be able to resend it.

This is wrong. Let's say I buy 2 BTC and the price just so happens to go up $1 because of that trade. I only put in $6600 in USD, but market cap went up by $16.2 million. The cap does not represent how much USD went into BTC.
Also, yeah, if you measure the cap in units that have no limit, the cap could have no limit. There is a limit to USD printing however. At some point too much of it in circulation would kill it.

Technically no split is necessary. You could create a transaction to send bcash directly to an exchange right now. If any reasonable exchanges had deposits open, that is.

You said if they are not processing transactions why reward them.. They are processing transactions but up to 1MB at most per block. There are more transactions in queue and new ones keep piling on, so the fees rise. Also empty blocks ensure security of all earlier transactions by adding 1 more confirmation. It is said 6 confirmations pretty much guarantees there won't be a chain re-org for tx 6 blocks deep. It's 6 full or empty blocks, doesn't matter.

Can't tell. If transaction demand continues to be high, all of the transactions paying lower fee will continue to remain queued up. It's not the amount, it's the transaction fee that's at play here. Transactions do expire after a few days. You can then re-send it.

Backups. You need to have a backup outside your main place of residence. There are plenty of wallets to chose from:

You get a share for all work not close misses. The guesses you tried don't need to be tried by everyone else so it helps.
If you find a solution your best strategy is to advertise it and claim almost $40k block reward. If you hold it some other miner will find it eventually and will claim the reward before you.
In a pool you're mining to the pool's address and that's where 12.5 block reward goes. Pool later pays out to your address. I don't know if you could find the solution then somehow send it quickly to your solo miner and advertise the block to the network. Seems like that would be obvious for miners to try so there's got to be mechanisms in place to prevent it.

@_date: 2017-08-05 04:49:52
If you sell bitcoin and there is a gain you owe tax on it. Even if you don't take USD out of the exchange. In stock market the broker calculates this stuff for you, how much you bought for, how much you sold for and the difference and reports it to IRS. Exchanges don't report. If they did they must send you a form. But, IRS went after coinbase and can go after any exchange for records. Your best bet is to pay fair amount of tax on the gains or live in fear constantly looking over your shoulder.

What do you mean "faster transactions?" Segwit does not change block interval. Your dust can't be helped by segwit directly.

Nonce (not nuance) is a number miners include in calculation of block hash. They keep trying different number until block hash value is smaller than a certain difficulty value. # of zeroes in the front is not exactly it, those zeroes are padding. Network rules require the block hash to be calculated and meet the criteria for block to be valid. Invalid blocks are rejected. Miners who try to fake blocks without the work don't get paid. Blocks are just transaction data, not sure what you mean can be malicious about it. Someone would need to hack not just their 8 or 50 peers, they would need to hack more than half of all peers. That's 90 to 100 thousand nodes running on anything from newb Windows PC to hardened servers in datacenters. This hacking scenario is very very unlikely.

Confuses "ease to transport" i.e. carrying money in your pocket, with transactions which are transferring money.
Repeatedly lies about average confirmation time saying it was 2 hours. It was and still is 10 minutes if correct fee is paid.
Repeatedly lies about what caused a change in market share: fees going up made BTC market share go down. BTC market share changed quite a bit because NEW coins with large caps were created. Even bitcoin with 8MB blocks couldn't have prevented that. People will create shitcoins and run ICOs.
BS about high fee in his transaction. Whatever it was, right now can pay 11 sats per byte.

There is a point to what you said about long term profiteers. It is relatively easy to drop $4 on a transaction fee since they have so many more $ now. **I'm not paying $4 to increase average fees**, I'm paying it because I can afford the convenience of getting into next block. I don't want to pay that much, of course. I do because that's the state of the network and I have the wherewithal to observe it and pay accordingly. The wallets and exchanges are having a harder time with that I suppose. Poloniex seems to do a great job bundling their transactions, gotta give them credit.
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:25:00
It's unlikely that BTC will increase 2x or 5x quickly from this point. Some of the smaller coins could. They could do 20x or 50x. 
As with any investing there's risk and as with any gambling most bets are losers. You could just look at the charts and ignore the coin's fundamentals. Or you could research each one you add to your portfolio, checking for how it's mined, whether dev team is active, whether there's a cap on total # of units, whether it's open source and decentralized and so on. You could chose to avoid proof-of-stake coins, ones with huge # of already issued units, corp centralized closed-source crap like XRP, and coins which destroyed immutability of their project to bail out themselves and their friends' millions $$.
Or you could ignore all that noise and go with bitcoin, but.. mind that if you search for bitcoin on the above site you will get 8 results. Be sure to buy the right one.

Unless you run it for a while and have more than 8 connections (port forwarding is working) it does not help the network.
Running a node has no effect on speeding up transactions. Setting higher fees is a good way to make sure your tx is prioritized.
Full node if used as a wallet ensures all the blocks are properly verified and you are seeing the correct state of the network. If you are using 3rd party wallets/services you are relying on them and trusting them that the transactions you see come in are valid.

The beauty of hardware wallets like trezor is that signing happens on the chip in the device. Signing keys never leave it, they don't touch the PC or the browser. I don't know about sweeping paper wallets into trezor but once you send coins to it, it will be a much much more usable mechanism than a piece of paper with barcode. Secure transaction signing with HD wallet is what you pay for, i.e. it's good for safe frequent spending, even on less-than-ideally-secure systems. If you don't plan to move the coins for a long time, parking them on paper is much cheaper.

Typical transaction is undefined and can vary. Some people use multisig a lot while I don't. I have a setting in electrum which says use multiple change addresses. My payment to one address usually goes to 3 or more. Over time those will need to be combined and will cost more to send. Other wallets may or may not do that so your typical usage is not the same as my typical usage.

TLDR: Do not mine. Do not buy mining contracts or shares, or any type of cloud mining. But you may be able to mine other shitcoins with a GPU. This subreddit is for bitcoin, however, so you'll have to ask elsewhere.
Block reward is 12.5 BTC. Blocks are 10 min apart on average. The whole world gets ~144 blocks per day or 1800 BTC per day in rewards. Miners are rewarded roughly proportionately to their hashrate vs the network's hashrate. Network speed is 6,564,000 TH /s. Let's say you bought a 14TH antminer s9. That is 0.000213 % of network speed and therefore it will get ~0.000213 % of daily payout. 0.003834 BTC per day, ~$15.83. BTW, this 14TH unit is about 30000 times faster than any PC you planned to mine with. PC/GPU bitcoin mining is dead.
[Here's the pic of setup making money mining bitcoin.]( I count 6 miners per shelf. You will compete with them, and others bigger than them, for the same 1800 BTC per day with just one S9? Forget it.
As homework, look up hashrate difficulty increases. Roughly: the more people mine the harder it is, so your payout will decrease over time until S9 will cost more in electricity to run than BTC it will generate. You'll have to keep adding more miners.

Finding blocks is guessing the right nonce to make the hash value acceptable given the difficulty setting. This is random but miners who try trillions of combinations per second vs 1 or 2 per second will win much much more often.

There is only one bitcoin :) The other coin is just some shitty altcoin, don't worry bout it. Only up to 1MB of transactions can be cleared per block and transactions are coming in at a higher rate than they can get cleared. I.e. people are sending a shitload of transactions. Also, some miners occasionally jump to mine that other shitcoin bcash and thus BTC blocks are found less often. Sometime 30-60 min between blocks instead of the normal 10 min. Difficulty adjustments are not immediate when lots of hashpower is added or removed. This exacerbates the backlog problem.

Interesting that Roger denies having created bcash. Says it was a surprise for him as well. I was under impression he and some miner were funding it.
His one argument about bitcoin working fine for 8 years and then blocks becoming full causing a drop in market share, is one giant "correlation is not causation" fallacy. At the beginning, of course bitcoin was cheap to send, there was not much demand for block space. Transactions were cheap. Confirmations came as fast as 6-8 minutes sometimes when we had massive hashrates being added. But now people have reasons to send BTC and of course, spam attacks.. The altcoin explosion would have happened anyway, due to P&amp;D, and those who missed the bitcoin boat wanting another repeat performance. Plus every week some ICO would launch giving it million dollar valuation, and all of those "out-of-thin-air" caps being cumulatively compared to bitcoin's.
Richard is adamant that bitcoin can't be spent anywhere. This makes him sound ignorant. He probably have not tried. He does say he is already relatively rich so he doesn't spend his BTC. With sites like egifter.com and purse.io, and a slew of others, it's possible to buy just about anything from trinkets and groceries, to appliances and furniture.

Never transfer between exchanges directly. You don't know which side is screwing up if there's a problem. Always transfer to your wallet, let it confirm, then transfer to the other exchange. 50 cents in fees ain't going to bankrupt you. As far as tethers go stay away from them entirely.

You don't want unique name associated easily with you for cases where you don't want people to know how much money you have or what kind of things you pay for. Fiat banks are insured for $250k per depositor. Bitcoin banks not so much. They can run off with your bitcoins. They could get hacked and lose your bitcoins. They can be forced by government to deny you access to your bitcoins. If you have them in cold storage most of these issues are mitigated.

Trying to arb currencies is probably not the best use case because of exchange fees. Middle men take their cut.
You can send BTC to someone else at any time of day or night, without anyone being able to block it. You can store quite a bit of wealth just by memorizing some words (not recommended as brains can be squeeshy). If securely stored, your bitcoin cannot be frozen, invalidated, or confiscated from you, unlike traditional bank account balances.

Yes, because it takes time to transfer funds from your bank to coinbase's bank. You can't avoid this but what you can do is transfer funds first. It will take a few days but then you have money ready and can buy instantly. Move funds to GDAX and you can set a limit order and buy with zero fees.

You must send coins to the address generated on the wallet. If you don't you are basically defeating the purpose. The point of the device is that keys on it were never seen by anything connected to the internet.

That's trading on margin. Risky. You could earn nothing, or even end up losing money if BTC drops. And not only did you lose on BTC, you still have to pay back the loan.

Most miners mine with a pool and don't run nodes. You can run a node as your main wallet. That's the safest way to ensure you are on the right chain. A node that pops on and off is not as useful to the network. If you're just a consumer use a lightweight client and forget the node business.

Wallets store keys, not coins.
Do not use a wallet which runs in a web browser so no blockchain.info
You can create a new wallet in electrum in a disconnected laptop running anything except windows. Sweep the paper wallet private key into it. Transaction string will be generated. Copy string to a connected device and push it. Continue to generate and sign transactions in offline mode and copying and pushing them on separate online devices. Send to multiple exchanges in small chunks if you want to sell. 
Running electrum on disconnected laptop would eliminate majority of threats. There are some that might get in via USB for example so not airtight but certainly workable. Or just use a hardware device. Trezor 2 is going to come out eventually.

Nothing would happen. He would need to buy them from someone willing to sell them. That happens on exchanges. People list what they sell and others list what they want to buy. If price is matched a trade occurs. Buying bitcoin in bulk would reduce available supply which would escalate the price more and more with each coin purchased. It would not be anything any one or 100 billionaires will be able to afford to do. Also some coins are irrevocably unspendable due to users losing their keys. So no, no one can buy every bitcoin.

You'd have to check out wiki for rules. 
Valid blocks must meet lots of criteria, yes. Some of that criteria forces only valid transactions to be included, block must include a link to previous block, it must be smaller than 1 million bytes, etc. Mining process exists so that work/energy is expended to try to update the chain with new block. At the moment this work is very expensive. No one will try to do it for nothing, just throw money away. If miners try to mine blocks they will mine valid ones so that they can get paid for them 12.5 BTC and all the transaction fees. Mining must go on indefinitely, that's how transactions are confirmed.
You cannot create a transaction transferring money from random account to yours without it having a valid signature. That can only be generated by signing the tx with the private key. If you don't have the key to random account you can't generate valid signature. No valid signature - the transaction will not be included in any block.

Some coins can tank and stay down for a while or forever.

Most cryptocurrencies are not anonymous. Personally I'd like to think nobody should see how I spend my money, not you, not JimBob, not the government.


They should either educate themselves then or stay out. It isn't a mandatory thing.


Well, they have utility and people value anything that is useful. Censorship resistant network for worldwide trustless reassigning of tokens without 3rd party risk is something people want. Some also like the ability to discreetly keep funds free from freezing and seizures.


This will be apparent only when/if the bubble pops. Perhaps $200k per btc is a bubble and it pops to settle at $100k per coin wiping out half the market cap. At those prices today's $4300 is barely a blip.


It is impossible to recover, period. And that's good. If there was a way to recover other people's cryptocurrencies because it was labeled "lost," the whole system couldn't be trusted.


Agreed. No argument here, and I'm talking about the coins themselves while article talks about exchanges and craptokens based on ETH. To use a cliche, if yahoo mail is down it doesn't mean all of email is broken.


Impossible to tell today. In the future this will turn out to be true if bitcoin price drops and never recovers, or will turn out to be false if the promised blockchain-based infrastructure and services take off in unexpected ways.

Addresses are created like this: long random number is private key, ecdsa math is used to generate public key from it, some double hashing, encoding and adding checksum to generate address from the public key. None of this requires anything online. Address is useless and bitcoin network doesn't know anything about it until something is sent to it.
With public private keys basically, any message you sign with private key can be verified with public key. You can sign things without revealing the private key and anyone can verify that you indeed have it. That's how transactions are sent - you must sign transaction (which is just a message or bunch of text) with private key of the address derived from it.
You can generate billion addresses per second and yes you could get one with btc associated with it on first try, but search space of addresses is huge. Unlikely to ever get a hit in earth's lifetime.

You can send a transaction from your mycelium wallet to another one of your addresses even before the import is confirmed. You'd have to set the priority fee and it will be pretty expensive.

bitaddress.org click on zip at the bottom and download it. extract it. You can disconnect and open bitaddress.org.html. Internet not required to generate keys. Nothing will be stored anywhere. Ideally after you're done and saved the keys elsewhere, reboot before reconnecting to clear everything from memory. If your PC is infected the malware may store the keys and send them later when connected, but in that case you've got bigger problems.

Your fee is 176 sats/byte. Good fee right now is in 350+ range. See the bottom chart  Transactions paying the highest fees are included in blocks first. Only up to 1MB can be cleared per block. People who understand how this operates and need their transaction to confirm quickly pay the high fee (or their wallet sets it for them). While it seems out of control it is not. Not everyone has the same needs. If I and Joe and Mary don't want to pay $5 fee right now we will not send any transactions. This reduces the demand for block space - 3 transactions fewer than it could be. It's a self balancing mechanism. You can pay the fee if you need to move coin pronto, or consider alternatives.
You can wait. While you do that look up RBF and CPFP. Those may be an option for you.

That's not a bad plan. Of course hardware wallets sign transactions on an internal chip without exposing keys to the device they are plugged into. The iphone runs iOS which is a big ass operating system with a huge attack area. It is possible an exploit could eventually exist which can burrow into your phone whenever it goes online, especially if you keep it unpatched. Having said that, iOS is reasonably secure. You are better off doing this than running a desktop wallet on a Windows PC with which you browse the web and install random videogame demos.

Most stores don't accept bitcoin, they accept fiat through a payment processor like bitpay. You have 15 min to *send* your transaction, not have it *confirmed*. But they will still hold until confirmation so you don't want to put in a very low fee, otherwise it may linger for days.
 Bottom chart. ~1MB of highest paying transactions will be chopped off the top for every block. If you want to be near the top that's the fee to set. I wouldn't go lower than 240+ sats per byte right now. You can see the fee in Preview in electrum before sending and type in what's needed.

If you sent coinbase to coinbase account there should be no fees. If you sent through the bitcoin network there is a miner fee. It is high because demand is high. However, coinbase does not calculate fees correctly. Sometimes they send transactions with 1 satoshi per byte, or with a fee that is too high. You need to complain to them. Coinbase is a btc vendor to buy and sell. Don't use them as a wallet, use your own.

-It's bitcoin. Not bit coin. Not BitCoin.
-bitcoins are not what is being stored. Wallets store spending keys. Wallets can provide encryption of the wallet file, requiring a password to spend the coins or to even open the file.
-Backups are essential. Recently someone lost quite a bit by having a backup on a flash drive sitting next to PC which burned up in a fire. A copy of backup must be securely stored outside main place of residence.
-There is no set bitcoin price. Prices on exchanges represent the last trade. They vary on each exchange because they are somewhat closed environments and shifting funds into them and out of them incurs time delays. You can follow your favorite exchange for pricing, or an index. There are several, like bitcoinaverage, coindesk, winkdex, etc.
-Your best source to purchase bitcoin depends on where you live and how much information you are willing to disclose. Most large legit exchanges will require identity verification, uploads of ID scans, and sometimes (and this is fucking ridiculous) a selfie of you holding your ID. A few options exist which do not require this much disclosure but they generally have a price premium and/or higher risk of getting scammed.

It's not complexity, it's mining difficulty. It doesn't increase without reason, it increases because more hashpower is added to the network. Once hashrate stabilizes so will the difficulty.

Two possible answers. One is that larger blocks will require more computing resources. Not all users will be able to afford the increased cost leading to more and more centralization. Bitcoin without decentralization cannot work. Second answer is they are working towards funneling users into blockstream created 2nd layer transaction solution and extract fees that way to eventually provide profits to their VC investors.

Lightning network has its own issues and it's not yet known how well it will do. A block limit increase would not be all that bad, but it also has downsides, mainly affecting decentralization.
The problem with segwit2x, also known as new york agreement, is that it was conjured up by a few suits and proposed as a noncontroversial change. Thing is, it is controversial, not everyone agrees with it, and if a few company CEOs and miners can change bitcoin so can the government. It is undesirable for bitcoin to be changed so easily by a small group of rich people. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:26:43
So the case to miners will go something like this: don't go for block size limit increase, earn less in fees because of segwit, earn less in fees because you can confirm only 1MB of transactions every 10 min. How does that sound, eh?

Your suggestion is good but more accurately it would say something like: your bitcoin and bcash are locked by the same key in the paper wallet.

Often asked and answered. You should use the search function --&gt;
The short answer is fees. Recently there was a block with 6+ BTC in fees, paying just over 50% of the 12.5 BTC block subsidy. Eventually block subsidy will be the minor portion and fees will comprise the major portion.
While it's true that 2140-ish is when last btc will be mined, by that time the block subsidy will be minuscule. Halving to 6.25 will occur in about 2.8 years. And to 3.125 about 4 years after that. Fees per block today are about equivalent to the block subsidy approximately 6.8 years from now. In 10.8 years 1.5625 btc per block will be just a small bonus compared to fees collected. Mining empty blocks would not be profitable. We should see fewer or none of those.

Phone orders are very expensive for the company. It's dying out if not already dead. One call center person can do let's say 6 orders per hour or 48 per day. They need to sell at least enough stuff in 48 orders, such that the after-tax profit covers their wages. 48 orders. On websites, people might place 50000 orders in a day. So you can see why phone orders are discouraged.

Yes all 3 will be drained and you will need some in the 4th address to pay the transaction fee. Fee will depend on if 0.3 in the address is stored as 1 input or 3 inputs of 0.1 each. Here is an example of what I mean.   see the AC6AZ.. address on the left? It had 0.11143337 BTC and 0.15415597 BTC as separate inputs stored in same address. If you don't see it enable Advanced view at the bottom of the page.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:37:11
Segwit does not come with any kind of "block size increase." Segwit transaction size is accounted for differently using weight and signature data is not counted towards the limit. It's like putting luggage on roof rack on the car - you didn't get a bigger car. Normal non-segwit transactions will continue to be the majority until people are comfortable with segwit ones. They must still fit entirely into 1MB block.
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:03:37
Not really. You know only the addresses you deposited to but for example, after buying and selling a bunch of btc in your account, the 5 bch could come from any 5  btc private key, not necessarily the ones you deposited.
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:20:06
Profitability depends on both. You get the same proportion of daily block rewards as the proportion of your hashrate to that of the entire network. I.e. if your hashrate is 2% of the network you can expect to earn 2% of the rewards. I should mention that btc and bcash networks are completely separate.
It also depends on difficulty because blocks are found faster or slower per day so you can earn more or less per day, but so does everyone mining. Again it's proportional.

Plenty of speculative demand still exists I guess. Certainly some utility is needed and it's still there even at $7 per tx or whatever. I'm not saying high fees are a good thing but at current level of transaction demand that's the price to pay. I don't want other demand to leave but at the moment it needs to consider alternatives or pay market rate.

VPS operate on standard arch general purpose processors, with all their instruction sets and various inefficiencies. Miners operate millions of small single purpose chips arranged into rows and rows on PCB. These chips do nothing but the required hashing operation and are magnitudes faster at mining. Like 10000x faster. You might find a GPU vps for mining a shitcoin (they are usually designed for brute forcing passwords) but they will be expensive and you will still lose a huge amount.
Your best bet might be to get on Starbucks wifi and exchange into other coins on shapeshift.io, send through a few hops, and then on another day exchange back to btc.

Visit their websites. There are basically 3 ledger, trezor, keepkey.
The gist of the operation is that seed and keys are generated on the chip in the device. They are never exposed to the computer you connect the device to. Transactions are signed on the microprocessor on the device.

You getting paid in BTC does not mean that everyone around you has to roll over and accommodate you.

Nobody deletes anything. All information you provide to a vendor will be kept by that vendor at their discretion. Information may or may not be stored encrypted. It may end up being leaked publicly, with no recourse for you, through a hack. It may be sold along with vendor assets if vendor puts itself up for sale. Buyer could be a conglomerate, a VC firm, or a foreign entity.
Your mailing address is always the same for every vendor you sign with, but your email should be different, your password must be different, your username should be different, and your "recovery question" answers need to be MD5 hashes of actual answer strings. Don't use SMS for 2FA.

Bigger blocks require more resources to process and store. Only the larger entities can afford the extra expense. As smaller participants drop off, the decentralization of the network weakens.

You don't count bitcoins and litecoins together so why count BTC and bcash together? Bcash is a separate altcoin. More frustrating: search for bitcoin here  There are 8 of them.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:33:52
It's best to separate them to avoid confusion down the road. bcash is a different coin, as different as dash or litecoin. So you want to get a separate dedicated bcash wallet. You will need to move all your BTC to a new wallet first. Then load your BTC private keys into bcash wallet. I've prepared before the fork and consolidated all my BTC into ~10 addresses. Then spent and loaded each key at a time, starting with smallest value in case of a screwup, and it was somewhat of a hassle. There are probably easier ways to do it now.

In short, almost any reasonable wallet, including the hardware ones, will generate for you a seed. 12 or 24 specific words in specific order. If you have that list of words you can recover your wallet at any time.
You must securely save that list of words. That means they cannot be in clear text. Perhaps in a password protected zip file. It also means they cannot be stored just on the phone/laptop which may get destroyed. A backup copy must exist outside your main place of residence, perhaps at work. I also have encrypted backups online to which I can get to from anywhere in the world with an internet connection.

No. Electrum is a bitcoin only wallet. I don't know if other coins have separate seed or the same on trezor, don't own one. If you are going to import to a PC you lose the safety that trezor provides and would have to rebuild your seed on trezor and send coins out and back in to addresses based off new seed.

For transactions to be stacked on top of yours they need to pay higher fees than yours. And "the miners" is not like one or two guys. It's many independent people who compete to mine blocks. No guarantee that the miner spamming will get their fees back by finding the blocks with their own transactions. If they spam a lot they stand to lose a lot of money. That cost is a deterrent against miners gaming fees up.

No "The US" has not classified it as property.
One US agency, the IRS, said it's property requiring accounting for capital gains. Another agency, FinCEN, said it's a convertible virtual currency, requiring money services business license. Third agency, the SEC, said it's a security. Probably most reasonably judges in courts said it's money or functions as money, so stealing it or fraud with it is a crime. None of these are the official determination, and it will be treated in whatever way is most convenient to "them" in context.

Running a node ensures that you see the proper state of the network without trusting a third party. Using SPV lightweight wallets has some risks, they could spy on all your transactions, they could lie to you about having received funds, etc. Full node costs are primarily in bandwidth.

Tech stagnation is a little harsh. There have been some great additions and improvements in core in the last 3 years.
Alts were inevitable; the "missed-the-bitcoin-boat" crowd is very large and they want something their GPU can mine.

Coinbase "taking coins from users" - this should not be a reason not to use them now. The fork event is over, and they will give coins out to everyone in a few months.  There are plenty of reasons not to use coinbase beside that. You'll have do your own research. The site you want to use is GDAX.com that's the exchange. Coinbase is not. Another option is gemini.com and kraken.com All of these will thoroughly anal probe you to establish that you are not a frog. You will have to provide IDs and maybe picture of you holding your ID. You can forget that the fork happened. The chain that split off bitcoin is likely to fail. Bitcoin is fine. Almost all price run-ups in all markets are followed by a correction so mind that.

Most likely it will be fine and you'll see it. Unconfirmed transaction will clearly show that it is unconfirmed. Once it is mined in a block you will have one confirmation. At this point you have a good confidence that you have the coins. As more blocks are mined that confidence increases. In most cases 1 is fine, for a million dollar transaction I'd wait for 6 or more confirmations.
Wallet uses seed words to generate strings of random numbers which are keys and each key allows you to spend coins associated with an address for this key. You can add a password to encrypt the wallet file. Wallet password can be changed. It encrypts the file only and the seed and keys do not depend on it. If your seed words are exposed someone will take all coins from your wallet without knowing the wallet password.
8/1 fork was deliberate. It required a block which is specifically larger than 1mb. That block did not adhere to bitcoin network rules so a new chain started from it. The block could have been discarded but bitcoin cash supporters kept mining on top of it extending the bitcoin cash chain. It did not require 50% voting, just some hashpower mining it.

That thick teal layer of 0-5 satoshi per byte transactions is not hurting anything. You just need to pay 6 satoshi per byte to place your transaction in front of all those in queue. If they are spam, they are cheap spam; it won't confirm and drop off. When there are 100MB of transactions with 600 sats/byte fees then we have a problem.

Fees are percentage based of the amount bought or sold. So you save more if you trade more. If you buy 10 BTC from coinbase that's going to be $481.27 in fees. If you place a limit buy order on GDAX and someone sells into it, your fees are $0.00

Astounding! You know paypal has revenues and profits. You can compare those to paypal's market cap. You could buy all of paypal for market cap + premium. Bitcoin does not have revenues or profits.

You can sign a messages using private key. Public key is used to verify. In practice there is only 1 private key -&gt; per public key -&gt; per address (theory is more complicated). So you can't sign something with all addresses because there is a huge number of them, they are deterministically created when needed. And you can't sign with a seed because I don't think it has a corresponding public key to verify the signatures. It probably could be generated. You do get the extended pubkey.. Probably not wise to sign with that.

Coinbase is sending transactions with 1 satoshi per byte in fees (but likely charging you for normal fee - theft). 226 is the size. Fee is on the right.

Use an exchange. Coinbase is a BTC vendor. Their exchange is gdax.com. Fees are zero for market makers; place an order in order book just below or above the price so it does not execute immediately. If someone takes your order they will pay fees and you will not.
If you use mobile coinbase app you can scan the QR code.
For novice it may be better to keep BTC in CB but it is not recommended in general. Not your keys - not your bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not anonymous.
Paper wallet is a single private key, with its associated address, printed on paper. If properly generated on non-networked machine the risks of exposing the private key to malware are eliminated. Hackers can attempt to hack your PC or mobile wallet but cannot reach a piece of paper stored in a safe. When spending from paper wallet the key will be exposed and so safety precautions need to be taken at that time.

Not technically but in all appearances. Everyone will dump bcash until it goes to zero (don't be the last one!). Miners will stop mining it. There, one chain again.

1. No. BCH does not fix technical issues. It also removes segwit and RBF in addition to increasing block size limit to 8MB.
2. No segwit was not going to alleviate capacity problem by itself. It's an enabler for future enhancements in that area.
3. The "value" in each chain is not related 1 to 1. It's not like pouring water from one glass to another without spilling. You're thinking if all of BCH were returned to BTC, BTC would add 9.7 billion but it won't. As BCH is dumped it will get cheaper and cheaper, the last one might be sold for fraction of a penny. Value will be "spilled" on its move.
4. Whoever said ETH will replace BTC is a fucking idiot. ETH is not even a currency. It's meant to pay for computer time running smart contracts. It's basically slower and more expensive AWS creditz.

bitcoin.com's wallet probably stores data in your home directory and the wallet and settings were not erased when you uninstalled it (which is good). You can find and delete this data if you wanted to.
bitcoin.com is not an official source of anything for bitcoin. It's a for profit business run by a controversial person. Don't go to that site. bitcoin.org is more neutral. 
Wallets should not require emails. 12 words are used to generate private keys for addresses in the wallet. Same 12 words in exact order will generate the same set of private keys. Not every wallet supports the same derivation scheme so 12 words might load but not show any balance.

A dive may be a little strong. But what I meant was there would definitely be a drop in overconsumption. People will buy fewer of the random discretionary things, decorations, frills, garbage from infomercials. I mean, how many juicers and burger grills do ya need? The prospect of spending BTC, which may go up in value next year, will make just about anyone think twice about buying fidget spinners with it.
On the other hand, it's not a dire situation of merciless hoarding either. People still buy phones and tv's even though they know a better model will be out next year, possibly for the same price as today. And they will hopefully buy the right size home, not a mansion, and the right amount of quality food, and not junk half of which will spoil and be thrown out.

Smartphones are known to have vulnerabilities. It is not the most secure place to store bitcoins but it is convenient for daily use with small amounts.
There are multiple miners. If one wants to block you, others will probably still accept the transaction. Miners also don't necessarily know which addresses are yours exactly unless you disclose it.
Miners bundle transactions into blocks and write them into the shared ledger.  For that they collect the transaction fee.
Nodes download, validate, store, and upload to other nodes, the shared ledger. The nice thing about Bitcoin not requiring trust is that everyone (every node) has a copy of the transaction ledger. It can only be updated if all rules in the software were followed. Some nodes run in less desirable pruned mode, and keep only a small portion of the entire blockchain (ledger).

It aims to do something different. They are comparable in some options and features but bitcoin is functioning like a currency to buy things and eth is functioning like a token to pay for computing resources. Eth is like AWS bux or Azure credits. (Oversimplified of course since these are centralized massive cloud hosting services.) This is a very very limited use so it will never be as big or popular as bitcoin. People can pretend it's a currency and exchange it but it's just not. You are talking old school barter. Trade hammers for chickens, for 2 loafes of bread, for 100 eth tokens.
The currently operating contracts on eth are mostly useless. Any they can stop working at any time if there is a hard fork messing with gas limits or whatever. (Gas. So fucking stupid. Supposedly a futuristic tech but uses tired fossil fuel terms? Gimme a break.) So basically any demand for eth is speculative. Etc demand I don't understand at all - eth holders got that for free! BTC demand is speculative too but, unlike eth, people can buy just about anything with BTC if they wanted to. Best feature of eth - it can be traded for BTC.

Security will not stay the same. Warehouses full of sha256 hardware will be useless. Comparative hashrate (1 hash in algo1 is not the same as 1 hash in algo2) with the new mining algo will be a fraction of what we have now until reasonably profitable hardware comes online. This will open bitcoin to 51% takeover attacks. In all probability, bitcoin will be killed by the government which can purchase GPUs (or whatever type is needed) at enough scale to take over mining for a while. Everyone will lose trust in any pow cryptocurrency and will never invest as much as sha256 ASICs have seen again.

At this point it would difficult and expensive, whereas if POW is changed and the hashrate is dropped, the off-the-shelf hardware can be launched considerably quicker and cheaper. It's an opportunity of good timing to sow distrust in all cryptocurrencies for 100 million vs 5 billion, or whatever.

Wheel bearings in the rotors are getting too small for the rotational momentum. Larger bearings could cope with the torque much better.

Anyone with basic math skills could calculate how many transactions can happen per day. This was a well known limitation for years.
Bitcoin was not made for unbanked. "Wait till all the unbanked flood in" was a marketing tactic to effectively describe the future demand, enticing people to buy bitcoin.
Things have their price. If you drive a car vs riding a bicycle because you can afford that car - are you elitist AF? Don't be polluting the environment with exhaust fumes just because you have money for a car. Get on the bike and start pedaling.

First, you have to be miner. Second, you have to actually mine a block with that tx before anyone else. Third, you have to have lots of nodes accept it as valid, which they won't because it's too big. Fourth, you need other miners to start mining on top of it so it doesn't get re-org'd out of the chain, but many won't since it will not be a valid block. Other than that those coins are as good as yours.

On the other hand I can understand supply and demand forces at work here. People want that limited block space more and more so the price of it rises. I'm just a user and don't have the solutions. There are people with incentives, desire, and skills who are working on the capacity problem.

You need to save the seed words list that the wallet gives you, (or the backup file, depending on the wallet) securely, off your phone. To restore just enter words or restore backup. You should try to restore your backup by pretending everything you own is gone, new phone, etc. Meaning your backup must be encrypted and not in the primary residence.

BTC market cap has been rising. Its ratio in proportion to all other currencies has been lowering. Not because bitcoin is doing poorly (clearly not. the network is extremely busy!) but because various tokens with huge emission caps and premined crap like XRP and ETH are getting bought by those who missed BTC boat and hoping for their 2nd chance.
Coinbase is not an exchange. GDAX is an exchange. Coinbase is a BTC vendor. The part where they don't allow you to set fees is a problem between you and them. Go complain to them. You're the customer and you want that feature.
There are many other shitcoins. Some are very fast. 15 second block time! Some are very cheap too. You can be a blahblahcoin millionaire for just a few bucks.

Blocks are 1 million bytes max. Transaction sizes depend on how many inputs and outputs there are. Most common transaction is one input going into 1 output + 1 change output. This is about 225 bytes. 4,444 transactions per block. Some transactions will be smaller, some will be bigger.
Transactions paying the highest fee per byte are prioritized first.

Larger transactions take up more space. Not larger in value, but larger in size. Size depends on how many outputs are being combined and how many inputs they are going to. This is a pretty standard transaction - [226 bytes unnecessarily paying $4 in fees]( This is a rather large transaction - [17 Kilobytes unnecessarily paying $250.36 in transaction fees]( Segwit transaction sizes will be accounted for differently but the concept is the same. You can fit a lot more 226 byte transactions into 1 Megabyte block than 17KB ones. Blocks are mined every 10 minutes on average.

Are you suggesting that a secure payment network should be free or cheap to use? Secured by miners who invested millions of dollars into equipment and electricity to keep it running, but still cheap for you to use it? And perhaps more directly, are you suggesting that BU has a solution to your problem? It does not. Even with gigantic blocks transaction throughput will not be very high. With gigantic blocks there will be only a handful of consolidated miners who can afford the infrastructure and bandwidth. And a handful of miners can be infiltrated, corrupted, blackmailed, or shut down by governments. Without decentralization bitcoin would cease to exist. BU is a 99.9% certain death sentence.

Bitcoin is technically a write-once, read-many ledger which is distributed and stored on thousands of independent peers. Bitcoins are not sent or received anywhere, rather the ledger entries are updated. It's arguably not a currency, we ascribe to it the "features" of currency. The characteristics of its token like scarcity, fungibility, and extreme resistance to change or duplication make it very useful in transferring value. Value is assigned on exchanges where bitcoin's price is determined by the last completed order.

You can sell your own bitcoin, like you can sell your own couch. Report and pay tax on capital gain. If you're doing it over and over, then you're a business. The rules are different for businesses whose product is money transmission vs couches, but both have some rules to adhere to.
For  different agencies consider bitcoin to be different things. "The US government" is not in agreement on what it is.  FinCEN says it's money. Judges in courts say it's money. SEC says it's a security. IRS says it's property.

It's number not amount. They are in mempool of the node you're looking at (blockchain.info in this case), not on the blockchain yet. Blocks can be maximum 1 million bytes. Blocks are found on average one every ten minutes by network design. 200K transactions or whatever cannot fit all at once. Transactions paying higher fees go first. Nothing is wrong with the blockchain, it is working as intended. The demand to use it is very high. This was a known limitation for a very long time. Everyone knows a solution is needed to increase capacity but there is bitter disagreement about how specifically to do it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:56:07
This is an issue with Coinbase. They are backlogged on withdrawals. Bitcoin transactions are not instant. They propagate through the network within seconds and take 10 minutes to confirm on average.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:44:27
Nothing weird. Someone is taking advantage of low demand for bitcoin block space to cheaply consolidate inputs. This is good. Reduces footprint of UTXO set and will reduce transaction fees when these values are sent on later. Their exact reasons for doing this? I dunno.

Wallets store keys, not coins. Coins don't exist. Mycelium app generates keys as needed from the 12 word seed. If bitcoin blockchain splits AND both diverging chains survive for a while, the keys in the wallet will unlock the same amount of BTC on both of those chains. Mycelium will follow one chain only, most likely, unless there's an update to it. You would have to follow instructions on how to separately access coins on the 2nd chain with a different wallet. Just make sure 12 word seed is safely backed up and don't make any transactions between 7/30 and 8/05, or until people on the sub post that it's safe to transact.

Have not looked into dynamics of this. Thinking about this logically it seems that including more transactions, especially big multi-kb ones, would take more hash time reducing the number of guesses the miner can make. But this part I'm not sure about, since merkle trees make rehashing unnecessary.
One possible scenario is miners don't include as many transactions to artificially grow the backlog and increase average transaction fee. Some blocks have 1.3 -1.4 btc in fees or more. That's a big add-on to the block reward. If they can ensure a nice balance between high fees and transaction throughput it's in their best interest to do so.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:52:29

I don't like it either. But there were no promises of magic. Anyone with basic math skills could divide 1 million bytes by average transaction size and see the best theoretical outcome way before investing any money into BTC. I'm not surprised shitcoins are getting pumped. A little surprised that BTC is enjoying a mad pump now.

You don't get to set any fees for a transfer out of the exchange. The exchange does. Poloniex does what I think is pretty smart. They collect 0.0001 from each withdrawal, bundle up 20* or so at a time, and pay a fee that is less than 0.002. It confirms relatively quickly and costs them less than what they collect in withdrawal fees. *Can't be sure if all 20 outputs are other customers or their own internal addresses.

Miner doesn't want to leave $23,500 on the table. It likely costs them $16,000 in electricity to find that block.
Looking at some pictures of mining facilities, many are just shady looking warehouse, with badly run wiring, probably inadequate cooling, makeshift shelving.

Not necessarily, no. Hardware wallets provide additional safety for sending transactions from less than ideally secured devices. Risk tolerances differ. I am using a desktop wallet and a couple android mobile ones. If my coins were to disappear I would see that as evidence that my device is not to be trusted anymore. If someone can remotely just reach in and take btc from your laptop or phone, you've got bigger security issues with that device already. Macs are rather secure, more so than Windows PCs, but that's no reason to be ambivalent. Mac malware threats are growing.

Do not keep coins in online wallets. If there is a split you want 2 different coins since then you can decide to sell one or the other for basically free money, or even keep both.

Every exchange is an isolated entity. It's easy to move BTC around. You can send it from one exchange directly to another (though not recommended). With fiat, you can't do that. You have to move it to a bank account and wait 3-4 days, then move it to the other exchange and wait 3-4 days. Also some exchanges only operate in their part of the world with their banking partners. I don't have any accounts in Chinese or Japanese banks. This friction of moving funds and other subtle factors like exchange risk (see Bitfinex) create the price discrepancies that you see. If BTC and fiat could move quickly and freely, the prices would be about the same everywhere.

Immediate financial incentives aside, there is another factor. Let's call it stubborn adherence to principles in face of overwhelming evidence. There is a segment of cryptocurrency community which truly believes larger blocks are good and segwit is bad (or they are idolizing someone who says that, and following off the cliff with them).

Yes, drugs and speculative trading are priced in, but there are definitely many things bitcoin does in its own right. Capability to store value such that no one can freeze it or confiscate it is nice. Option to pay anyone for anything without it being blocked is also nice. A segment of population values these things, a lot. BTC is now a rail into other alts and ETH, and the popular ICOs. It will have demand just for that reason; people want to buy shitcoins hoping for bitcoin-like gains.
Drug markets may be one use, but not for me or many people like me. I hold way more bitcoin than $50 or whatever is needed to score some hits. People like me bought at a certain price and would not be willing to sell below that price which restricts supply. (Tim Draper bought a ton at ~$600, and similar). So while a drop is expected, I don't see it going as low as $100. Maybe as low as $1000 at worst.

Gold has a 5000 year history of being sound money and store of value. Jewelry is just one use because it's easy to work with, doesn't rust, and does not irritate human skin.
I don't know how valuable litecoin will be or whether 62 to 1 ratio is reasonable.

I see. That's a good point. It is occasionally useful to maintain your wallet during off-peak times and consolidate inputs. At this very moment you can send a transaction with 0.0001 fee and it will be included quickly since the network is not busy. I also periodically create a new "frequent use" wallet so as not to keep saving lots and lots of used addresses. There are downsides to this, i.e. reduces privacy, and you lose transaction history (could still archive old wallets for that), but those trade-offs work for me in my use cases.

It's HD so when you create a wallet you are given some words - seed. If you back up these words, securely encrypted, outside your place of residence, you can restore this wallet in electrum on another PC or any wallet using same key derivation schema. You cannot import it into coinbase, nor should you. If you want to send something to CB just send it as regular transaction. Electrum wallet can be password protected too. The password would be used when spending coins. Password is for protecting local copy of the wallet. Wallet file can be backed up too if you wanted to. Seed words - if anyone gets those the wallet passwords is meaningless. Protect the seed words.

I've never used a btc ATM. You might find one that doesn't ask for too much info. I imagine "no records" is too much to ask for. The place where ATM sits likely has cameras. But it's probably not an issue unless you're cashing in or out proceeds of serious crime.
When selling $500 in btc understand that entire $1000 will be sent with the difference going into a change address. Paper wallet will be emptied out. ATM will not give you another paper wallet if you're selling btc to it. You likely will need to scan the paper wallet info into a smartphone, send $500 to address the ATM provides, and the remaining $500 will be on your phone not on paper wallet anymore.

Litecoin is not comparable to BTC. There is nothing going on with litecoin. There was buy the rumor sell the news effect.
In bitcoin the price is suppressed due to fear. Many traders exited into alts and fiat and sitting out on the sidelines. Once segwit and risks of forking are behind, the rally will continue.

If you feel like throwing in your vote get the bitcoinuasf.org version (BIP148). It's basically Bitcoin Core but it demands segwit. Understand that it will reject non-segwit blocks effectively cutting you off. If you don't want to mess with any of that just run Bitcoin Core. It does not have middle finger to miners mining non-segwit blocks in it.

If you're talking about hosted webwallet like on exchanges, they do not actually transfer bitcoin between accounts. They update a number in their SQL database which is very fast. When you withdraw bitcoin from hosted wallet to a proper wallet, that transaction would go through bitcoin network and requires a transaction fee.
Proper wallets store private keys generated from a seed. Each private key corresponds to one address. Sending transactions from one address to another, even if it's in the same wallet, would require going through bitcoin network, and for transaction to be mined into a block (which is confirmation); therefore fee is required. There are no accounts. I am not sure what you mean by accounts.

No, you bought BTC. Conversion implies EUR was destroyed but it was not. Coinbase has it.


There are no coins. There are outputs spendable by using keys. Coinbase manages keys for you so you don't own bitcoin, only a promise to give you bitcoin if you ask for it.




No. Do not use any wallet that runs in a browser.


These will be saved in a file electrum creates. You should not upload this file anywhere without strong encryption with a strong password. Pendrive backup is fine, preferably store a copy outside your place of residence. Electrum will give you 12 words. Securely store these and you can recover your wallet without access to the electrum file. Memorizing is good if you can, but can be unreliable. If these words are exposed you will lose the funds, so don't let it happen. You must create your electrum wallet on a secure PC. Malware can steal the words or private keys quietly.

Wallet.dat might be a core wallet thing. In electrum on Linux you can name the wallet file whatever you want.
If you create a watch only wallet do not delete any files. Wallet file can be encrypted with password so nobody can see your balances, but it will be recreated when you try to look at it.

There would be 42 million. You'd need to use some instructions/tools to separate coins on one chain from another and then they will be independent and usable on both chains. Obviously one chain will be bitcoin and another will be an altcoin, named whatever. That is if miners continue to mine both. It is likely the majority chain will have miners jumping over to it from minority chain since mining an altcoin with no value, no economic recognition, and no markets for it, is a giant waste of resources.

I guess you get bitcoinabc client from bitcoincash.org. I copied blockchain data from core but perhaps that can be avoided with pruning option. It had to reindex for a while but at least didn't redownload 100 gigs.
Then you get your private key from the paper wallet with any app supporting it, like mycelium.
Then import private key into bitcoinabc console command line importprivkey {privkey}.
You may have to send your BTC from that privkey first, and then claim BCC but I'm not sure about how good that replay protection is. I plan to try it with one privkey with very small amount first.
Would not trust that BTC paperwallet anymore since you're exposing the privkey. You'd need to create new one.

1. Wait until after 8/05.
2. Exchange rate or "price" fluctuates with supply and demand. Volatility risk is quite high. The price could fall hundreds of dollars in a day, or even go to zero if fatal flaw is uncovered.
3. Yes, but you sound like a kid telling parents that to get money they just need to go to the bank! You cannot control the price and it may go in the wrong direction.

Bip148 is random people forking themselves off the network by blocking non-segwit blocks. Individually, if your node or my node did that, or was simply turned off, nothing would happen and nobody would care. It would take a significant number of economically important nodes to make a difference. Bip148 was never meant to actually happen, I believe. It was meant to poke and provoke the rest to do what's needed.
BIP91 is segwit with 80% threshold and shorter activation window, vs the normal bip141 segwit with 95%.

Yes it would. But it would also be smart to get yourself set up and verified with 1 or 2 reliable exchanges and to fund those exchanges. You could swoop in and buy right after storm clears. I imagine many have the same idea and the price may rise with demand quite rapidly.
On the other hand, this is risky. Some exchanges may screw up the fork, stay on the wrong chain, not properly credit split coins, etc, etc. This could bankrupt them and withdrawing your fiat deposit may not be an option.

Yes, except one correction: the address is not the public key, it is a hashed and encoded public key. Hashing and encoding makes it shorter to save on tx data size and adds checksum so typed addresses are harder to screw up. It also hides the public key making it harder to reverse with certain type of attack, but attacking secp256k1 ecdsa is not a huge worry with currently existing tech.

Hmm, I was thinking 91 is bit 4, 141 is bit 1. I do understand why it's on different bit. I don't understand why miners hate 141 and like 91. It's the same segwit.


To clarify that comment a 148 node will reject non-segwit blocks after 8/1 which essentially makes 148 node dead to non-segwit miners. It's the same as if it was turned off. If you turn off your node literally nothing will happen to the network. Transactions and blocks will be routed around you. 148 could only work with a substantial majority.

I didn't read the code but the bitcoincash website is specific about the timestamp. Chain won't split at that minute, you still need a valid block for that. If mempool is low as expected (since everyone is warned to avoid transacting) it may take hours for a block larger than 1MB to be mined and start the split. Unless bch folks help it and stuff it with some fake transactions.

Understand what these things are. uasf/bip148 is nodes stopping validation of non-segwit blocks on aug 1. segwit2x is a funky name for a political agreement also known as NYA. bip91 is miners signaling segwit readiness on bit 4 instead of bit 1. bip141 is miners signaling segwit readiness on bit 1 - or standard core segwit. bip91 basically signals bip141 but at 80% threshold and much shorter activation/lock in period.
A node just uacomment signaling uasf/bip148 doesn't do anything at all. Actually running uasf/bip148 supporting client will make that client ignore non-segwit blocks even if majority of the network has no segwit. It cannot turn on segwit, only throw an ultimatum - talk segwit to me or don't talk to me at all. That's why uasf has f in it. Some nodes taking a hike will not have an effect but if majority do that would be bad. So uasf/bip148 politically entices miners into running segwit supporting clients. Miners could call the uasf/bip148's bluff. Signaling readiness implies miners are running segwit supporting client, but does not necessarily guarantee it. Will have to see what this bip91 lock in will bring.

I can't speculate about the splitting process. The only coin that did that so far was ETH and ETC and I don't mess with that crap. What I do expect is that instructions will be posted on how to split the coins to prevent replay on secondary chain. My intention is then to test the instructions with a small amount first.
Hardware wallet is designed to keep keys secret. I would want access to my keys in clear text. This is something electrum definitely offers but I'm nor sure which hardware wallets allow exporting private keys. They may be based on specific derivation schema and it is probably possible to get the keys using the seed with some bip44 or bip39 tool.
Your 1 btc will be safe. Hardware wallet will only work on one chain and can't be used to store coins on both chains. That's my guess. You'd need to keep the 1 btc from secondary chain elsewhere.

Your facts are messed up. The debt is $19.96 trillion.
Hate on banks is silly. Some are huge and bad, most are not. Mine is doing a fine job, never an issue. Banks do not own the world, and they do not control nor print money. The treasury dept prints money. Banks in general are private businesses and make money by serving customers and arbitraging interest rates between loans and deposits.
Yes they create new debt with loans. No all debt is bad. Education debt is ok if applied judiciously (i.e. not wasted on worthless degrees). Most people can buy cars and homes only with loans. Businesses borrow to invest into expanding, and so on.
Federal reserve executes monetary policy to maintain stability. Let's say your baseless claim comes to pass: federal reserve believes there is some systemic risk and to avoid this risk they must purchase bitcoin in great numbers. OK.. that's going to make some bitcoiners very rich in $$ terms. It is going to increase bitcoin value from $38B to let's say a huge number. It will also devalue the $. That's not always good. The rich bitcoiners will have millions but devalued millions won't be able to buy a nice house or a lambo, but maybe only an average car. So what's the point?

Definitely separate issues. Users can threaten to reject miners' blocks. But if 5 nodes or 500 nodes do that, the remaining ones will still accept the blocks and miners don't have to change anything. For users to enforce something they would have to do so in great numbers such that miners see no other choice. But getting users to come to a consensus in great numbers is the original "scaling debate" that lasted for couple years. It's not so easy to get supermajority on board.

You never owned any stocks? Which stocks you own and how many shares is all reported. Your desire for privacy in that respect is notable, but... cute.
Don't try to obscure it. IRS knows what bitcoin is. List "Bitcoin," price bought for as cost basis, price sold for (or traded for other good or service). Dates. Prices need to match btc price on those dates of course. Pick a price source and be consistent, i.e. coindesk index, or bitcoinaverage.com or even Coinbase. Assume the earliest btc you bought is the first to be spent, first-in, first-out method. Bitcoins aren't numbered or anything. Neither are stock shares, so it's similar. Or you can use last-in, first-out, but you must remain consistent for all transactions.
If IRS has to assign an agent to research you and do paperwork, that agent's salary and benefits will not justify getting $12 from you. So it's extremely unlikely you will be even asked anything. Especially since you're paying, not claiming a loss.

You will mine a portion of the daily reward proportional to network hashing speed.
~1800 BTC is mined per day. Network hash rate is ~5,304,613,300 GH. Let's say you bought an S9 (it's $1100 and doesn't ship until september) which is 13500 GH. Your fraction of hash rate is 0.000002545 so your reward per day is 0.004580918 or $11.82. Network hashrate is likely to continue increasing which will reduce your earnings further and further over time.

Bitcoins will be kept very safe in the blockchain for you. What you need to keep safe is the spending keys. If someone gets the keys say bye to your btc. Hardware wallets like trezor or ledger nano s are very good ways to keep your keys safe. Storing them with someone else is risky. Storing in desktop or smartphone wallet is also risky since your devices can be infected with key stealing malware. There are many articles on this, you need to do some research.

The key extraction I mentioned may only be necessary to claim bitcoins on the alternate chain.

All coins are in the blockchain at all times. If you are referring to blockchain.info that's a website and not the bitcoin blockchain. No it is not advisable to store anything with them or their wallet.
Local storage: usually the wallet stores seed from which private keys are generated. Bitcoins are in the blockchain not in wallets. Wallets store keys required to move coins.
If your wallet seed or private keys are exposed to malware on your PC then your coins can be stolen. Sometimes when sending bitcoins malware changes the receiving address to misdirect the coins. Check addresses before hitting send.

Fixes transaction malleability and something about enabling layer 2, like lightning network payment channels.
Making blocks bigger does not fix any problems. It kicks the can down the road until even 2MB blocks are full. It adds to centralization risk. It creates a moral hazard, i.e. hard forks for small changes are OK! It sets a precedent to do another hard fork and another. To increase block reward to 100 BTC. To lift the 21m coin cap.

"The blockchain" is not rejecting anything. Individual nodes do. And they are supposed to be rejecting non BIP91 blocks, not BIP141 ones. Finally BIP91 code is not in Core so anyone running Core is not rejecting BIP91 violating blocks.

A fork is an event when blockchain splits into 2 branches. You are referring to support for the alternate branch, called bitcoin cash, not support for "the fork."

Half-life 3 confirmed.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:34:36


Not exactly. The reason is that blocks can be 1 million bytes in size at most, so when there are lots of transaction waiting to get into a block only up to 1 million bytes of them can be confirmed every 10 min on average.


This is set based on current hashing power. Difficulty is adjusted to keep blocks coming in at a steady 10 min interval. It can drop if some miners shut down. It could be changed with a hard fork too but that is not necessary.


So like, having blocks mined every 5 min? or every 3 min? That has its own downsides. Nodes and miners need time to verify and distribute blocks, sometimes over slow connections. It would also require a hard fork to do, so not that simple.

I can look up the price of S9. I can guess your electricity cost. I can plug in number in mining calculator. I've done that before. You will get ROI after a while calculating just the capital and operating expenses. But add in the cost of your time/labor to do all this. And it's likely hashrate will keep on growing making your earnings much less than previously calculated. Also to answer your original question, nothing changes with mining with bip91/segwit. Even if it takes more or less hashing to find blocks, miners are still paid proportionally to how much hashrate they own.

Some of it goes to purse.io fees and most of it goes to the discount. The way it works is I want to buy a hard drive. It's $100 on amazon. I put up a listing saying I want it at 15% discount. You buy it from my wishlist and it's shipped to me. My BTC is released to you. You get bitcoins by making a simple purchase on amazon with a credit card. I get $100 item for $85 worth of bitcoin. It's clear why I'd want that deal - I'm saving money. Why would you want to do this? Well... I dunno, maybe you really want bitcoins and have no other convenient way to get them. So you overpay.

Segwit2x hard fork is to increase block size *limit.* This distinction is important I think since miners can still soft limit size of blocks they mine at 998KB. An informational infographic should be accurate.
Segwit is not a block size increase. It is a hack to not count signature data towards block size limit. If you put your skis on car roof rack vs shoving them in, you don't say you got a bigger car. Car size remained the same; just that skis and stuff are not taking up interior space anymore.

What's so special about original purpose? Some famous things started out with alternate original purpose; silly putty was invented while trying to make rubber cheaply.
Bitcoin is a settlement network in its basic operation. It has appreciated quite rapidly and if managed well, it can be a store of value. Stores of value have to have some usefullnes to be valuable in the first place, and bitcoin's feature resembling cash makes it useful and thus valuable. You *can* use it as cash where convenient, or hold it to sell later. Many people do both.

Save a copy of your wallet.dat file somewhere safe, off this computer. This contains all the private keys for any btc balance you have.
Download from 
You don't need to uninstall anything. Locate where the binaries reside. I don't know where it's installed through PPA. Likely in /usr/bin. Drop the 4 files from .gz archive's bin folder over existing files overwriting them (test_bitcoin file is not really needed, skip it). Start bitcoin-qt. It should recognize your settings, blockchain data, and your existing wallet. Might have to chmod +x to make them executable.
Understand the risks. On august 1 (actually sooner due to time difference with UTC) your node will reject non-segwit blocks. If the network does not cave in and activate segwit you, and ~12% of equally minded part of the network, will essentially cut yourself off. Do not send or accept btc transactions at least until august 5. Monitor progress to see which way the wind blows after that.

It's an unfortunate misnomer. Coins are spent only once. They may be credited twice. To extend, "zero conf transaction" was never a thing. That's just not how bitcoin works.

Miners create blocks to settle transactions. Miners collect transaction fees to keep mining blocks. Without miners there is no bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:57:03
There is a fee for every on-network transaction since a miner has to include it into a block. CB's fee is not flat. It depends on data size and network congestion. It is often overestimated. If it's more than 50 cents right now it's too much, but you likely can't set your own fee when withdrawing from CB. If you are holding some chump change, just leave it in CB.

In the last 130 minutes only 6 blocks were found. On average there should be 13. So the rate at which transactions get cleared out of the queue is much slower. More importantly, your fee is 120 sats per byte. Good fee right now is 220. Miners prioritize transactions paying higher fees.

Stop limit: when last price reaches stop price, sell at limit price. In your case it's buying ETH to cover the short position. So if last price hits 189 a limit order for 190 will be entered. If price moves up fast the position may not close.
Stop loss: when last price reaches stop price, sell at market price. In your case it's buying ETH so when last price reaches 189, a market order will be entered. This will close your position at best price available but if order books are thin your order may end up buying at much higher prices as it scoops up all the sell orders it can get.

Yes. When there are more transactions in the queue than can fit into next block they are prioritized by fee/kb. Your transaction need not pay the most fee, it just needs to pay slightly more than lowest of approximately 990 kb highest paying transactions. You can always get into the next block by paying more than everyone else in the queue, but that's a waste of money.

Bitcoin can go to zero. Compared to 401k, bitcoin has up till now offered much better rate of return, which is not at all guaranteed to continue.
Some sections of the web cry warnings that the "gold confiscation" of 1933 will repeat with government simply draining everyone's retirement accounts. Nothing you can do about that because they have tanks and aircraft carriers. It would be much easier to do than go door to door and shake down people for their gold jewelry and coins/bars. In that regard bitcoin has an advantage. A smart individual like yourself would keep a secret major stash and a minor stash. If/when bitcoin shakedown were to occur, you'd reluctantly give up your smaller stash.

He's known to add his own tweaks, including blacklisting some addresses, i.e. gambling sites. It is not his place to censor bitcoin transactions.

Fees act as a deterrent. Nobody has unlimited amount of BTC to indefinitely afford ever increasing transaction fees, and keep spamming forever. Full blocks for days and weeks is probably not a scenario which was given a lot of thought, but based on how it came and went, I'd say bitcoin handled it spectacularly. User complaints pushed for wallets to implement better fee estimation, which is a net improvement.

Yes, with an added benefit of having a QR code for easy scanning and bip38 encryption of the key. That key needs to be generated on a secure machine or at least one that is not connected to the internet. The upside is that the key is not exposed to the internet when it's on paper. Mobile wallets are almost always connected. Apps auto-update. People install various themes and games and junk which could steal priv keys or replace "send to" addresses in memory.

Paper wallet is a good option. Wallets don't hold coins, they hold keys. Keys have coins associated with them, let's say. Paper wallet is basically 1 key with whatever coin value is associated with it.
Fork may not happen at all. Or it might occur and minority chain would die within days or hours. You would have to carefully follow instructions to split the coins on separate chains, if the fork happens and both chains survive. You would have the same amount of coins on each chain. That splitting coins business is a bridge to cross when/if we get to it.

Signaling is per block, not each transaction. Miners create blocks with a specific version bit set. Bit 4 is a signal that that miner likes the idea of BIP91. Miners can set it or not. 80+% recently have.
Miners and users/nodes (you, me, coinbase, bitstamp, etc.) can accept blocks with bit 4 or reject them. Enforcement would be rejection of blocks which don't fit agreed upon condition after certain threshold (80% over 336 blocks) is met. But very few miners or users/nodes actually run a client which has code to enforce BIP91, so it will not be enforced automatically. With only 239 blocks left to activate BIP91 it's extremely unlikely that supermajority of nodes/users will upgrade to enforcing client. BIP91 getting locked in and activated would probably not have any effect in practice, but it is indicative of desires of bitcoin miners in general.
BIP141 idea is activation of segwit. Miners can signal they agree with it by setting bit 1 in block version. Bitcoin Core client is used by a good portion of miners and users/nodes and bitcoin Core does have actual code in it to enforce bit 1. There is much steeper threshold (95% over a year) before enforcement begins. That's meant to get supermajority all upgraded and ready to go in time. The 5% will be out of luck but hopefully they'll wake up and upgrade once their stuff starts failing. BIP141 is tracked here

People are signaling for bip91 for some nefarious reasons. I mean, you're exactly on point - why wouldn't they just signal bip141 segwit?
Plus let me rant for a sec about miner signaling. It's supposed to be an indicator that miners have upgraded and are ready to support a feature. It's not supposed to be a vote. It's not a democracy where they have a menu of choices to pick from. If they want the feature they signal they are ready. If they don't want the feature they keep their mouth shut and keep churning out blocks i.e. don't signal anything.
Finally no one has corrected me on this: signaling is not the same as actually running code which supports the feature. They could signal anything they want while running old pre-segwit Core client, I think.

Transactions per second is a terrible metric. What matters is how much data can fit in a block which is found every ten min on average. Transactions can be small, huge, and anything in between (in bytes, not in BTC). It's like measuring steps in a mile. Depends on how long the steps are, see?
With segwit signatures are not counted towards block size limit so more tx can fit. 2.7x is the number I've seen. With 2x blocks looking at 5.4x of current throughput.

Those running a UASF client will not accept non-segwit blocks effectively forking themselves off. Their actions have no direct effect on you or other users of bitcoin.

UASF bip148 client will reject non-segwit blocks starting august 1st. Not everybody is running that client but a good chunk of the network is. If miners mine blocks which get rejected they lose out 12.5 BTC on each one. So it's it's in their best interest to mine segwit ones. Their hand is being forced. It's a bit of a bluff though, will see if they call and raise. At least some are threatening to fork off and mine bitcoincash.org (BCC) coin on same day.

Depends on how you buy BTC. Wallets don't need any personal info but exchanges do, and they will track you. If the asset you hold appreciates, and you sell the asset, you owe tax on the gain. It is generally not advisable to mess with the IRS since they have the power to ruin your life. If it's a few bucks, they will not bother. If it's an average amount, just pay the tax to avoid looking over your shoulder. If it's a substantial amount hire a tax pro to help reduce tax owed legally if possible.

Segwit is good for almost everybody. It's bad for miners abusing a bug in proof of work to save up to 30% in electricity costs. Segwit would fix the bug. It's also bad for people who think bumping capacity 8x is a scaling fix. It is not. It's just kicking the can down the road a bit.

There's only one coin that still theoretically offers censorship resistance.

Without it, probably no, but miner does not have to claim full block reward. There is no reason to leave money on the table though.

No. You must buy bitcoin first. Bitcoin is a completely separate asset. It doesn't mix with traditional banking.
There are many btc wallets. Most popular ones are as secure as the device you use them on. If your Windows xp computer is infected with btc stealing malware that isn't wallet's fault.
You can't use btc as cash. You either have to sell it, or find someone who actually accepts btc. Some companies offer debit cards which you can use anywhere visa cards are accepted but they require a ton of personal info to sign up. They convert your btc deposit at the time of deposit or the time of purchase, depends on the card.

The votecoins will work great, I'm sure, but you will run into some major issues.
Distribution - you must ID every eligible voter and issue them the coin. Some states don't require ID to vote, which I find kinda mindboggling. This part will be difficult in and of itself. Now say you succeeded in distributing all votecoins properly. Where do you keep the link between the person's identity and their votecoin address, and result of their vote? In a centralized database the government has access to? Peep at Trump's attempt to demand voting records from the states. With this centralized DB, Trump and his ilk could easily identify EVERYONE who voted against him. Regular people might not be in trouble, but if it's someone known and influential, and Trump wants to make an example of them - they could go after that person because of exercising their right to vote.
Next, people will absolutely leak the private key to their votecoin. Not all but many many people. Do you issue a $150 votecoin trezor to everyone?
41% of eligible voters did not vote in 2016 election. They couldn't be bothered. Enterprising candidates swoop in and offer to literally buy their votecoin. In a hushhush way, through a guy in the alley, of course. People will take a gatorade or a stick of gum for their votecoin since it's essentially worthless to them anyway.
What blockchain can do is record something in way that cannot be changed. After the votes are counted up, who cares who you voted for? The winner won. No need to keep a permanent record of it. Blockchain application does not really address issues with voting systems.

It is a limited supply asset and as demand grows the price will go up. This isn't guaranteed. BTC could reach an equilibrium price too where transactions fees, hash power, and miner income are relatively stable.
You'd have to read up on deflationary currencies. "won't spend because it will be worth more tomorrow" is a tired old argument. People are going to spend out of necessity, for food and shelter at least.
It is too soon to say a small town can operate on BTC, let alone a country or whole world. Forget that for now. And GDP has nothing to do with the rate of BTC issuance. It's 1 block on average every ten min, 12.5 btc each block regardless of interest rates, GDP, CPI, stock market, deities in the sky, or your left toe. This rate will continue unless the entire user population agrees to adopt new rules and upgrade their clients.

IRS asked for info from Jan 2013 to Dec 2015. That's not to say they won't ask for more later.
IRS is not likely to send you any letters about anything to do with Coinbase, unless Coinbase sends you a tax form each year.
Moving funds from one place to another is not a taxable event, regardless how Coinbase records it. You can show you still have coins on trezor. No sale, no gain. No gain, no tax.
Since bitcoin is property, exchanging it for anything is a taxable event. Buy a gift card, domain name, alpaca socks, USD, another coin, whatever, you're supposed to calculate difference in what you paid for that btc and what it costs now, and if there is a gain you pay tax on that gain. This is quite ludicrous and only the most committed track it at that level. I don't spend or sell (hi IRS! *waves*) so nothin' to report.

The number of transactions is lower than it used to be. Some say it's because spammers stopped spamming the network. Spammers allegedly did that for some time to push their narrative that bitcoin urgently needs a capacity increasing upgrade. Argument is not without merit but there are risks. These are restated ad infinitum in various threads on this topic. Plus if bitcoin can be changed on a whim of some well heeled spammers, then we are in trouble.

Let me provide a more cynical take.
The rise: financial freedom, benefits to society, Pollyanna, blah blah. No.
1. People buy bitcoin as a gateway to buy shitcoins and ICOs. Daily % change is all that matters. No research is done. Everything went up. Bytecoin for fucks sake. If flappycoin still traded it would be 50x up to 50 sats now. It's clear to all that it is much much harder for BTC to go up 5x or 10x vs a 500 satoshi shitcoin, so alts recently had a blast.
2. Margin trading. There are massive BTC longs on very expensive margin. These are not people who buy and move to trezor. These are people who pump in hope of a quick sell higher. All margin longs will need to be sold as you know.
The drop: standard correction, rollercoasterguy, you_must_be_new_around_here_haha
1. Yes, it's standard correction. But also diversification into top 10 alts. It's true. I myself have a portfolio of a dozen or so coins, some of which have done really really well. (Not ~~un~~stoppable world computer coin.)
2. Profit taking, seeking opportunities in alts, margin calls, and also hedging the upcoming fork risk. Yes, august 1st folks. The way I read about bitmain's 3 day hidden chain, bitcoin will be unusable for at least 4 days. Empty blocks! Cheap tx fees again! On one hand it would be nice to have two coins if chain splits, figure out which one is viable and dump the dead one for free money. Maybe an ETH/ETC situation when both exist and appreciate over time. On the other hand there's risk to staying in BTC if chain re-orgs and lost coins bring BTC price 90% down. So that's your obvious reason  for the price drop.

Off the top of my head the buying will dry up as ICOs get regulatory flack and those who already issued ICOs will dump to buy lambos. So there goes the price. Next are technical issues like increasing CPU requirements and very quickly growing blockchain. Add in excessive amount of control on direction of the coin by vitalik and his handlers, a la theDAO fork to save their own investments. Vitalik himself tweeting about deleting accounts, maybe or maybe not capping supply, etc. It's like a plaything they can change on a whim. Gas. Really? Talking about next gen futuristic tech here but using fossil fuel terms to describe what it runs on? Anyway, the gas thing can break contracts if some changes are made in the future to outprice them. There is no long term reliability. And of course the change to proof of stake. No serious proof of stake coin exists and none have ever switched from pow to pos successfully.

It will take some time to get verified. You might have shitty low limits at first, below 2 BTC worth, especially if you want BTC right away. Coinbase owns the coins until you withdraw them so they could refuse to give them to you, get hacked and lose them, steal it all themselves, etc. If there is a glitch with you buying, selling, getting verified, getting logged in, or even adjusting your chair, be prepared to wait 2 to 3 weeks for your customer service problem ticket to be replied to.

Lawyer and safety deposit boxes are too risky. Lawyer or banker can transfer the coins and then play dumb and suggest you didn't secure the keys properly at some point in your setup and they were exposed and sweeped.
I've been thinking about this myself. Perhaps a Shamir's secret sharing split into several parts and only one part goes to lawyer to be disclosed only when you're gone.
Not entirely confident in locking transactions. Over time bitcoin may be upgraded such that it breaks them. I've read somewhere blockstream devs have their funds timlocked and some of the choices they make are to prevent themselves losing access to those funds.

First of all cryptocurrencies in general is not anonymous. Some have privacy enabling features, but most don't.
Second, you decided to purchase a premined, closed source, centrally controlled, unlimited issuance token, not a cryptocurrency.
You want to look for open source so code can be publicly examined. You want fairly launched, so that developers don't pre-mine a huge stake for themselves. You want limited total number of coins to create scarcity. You want no centralized control where "Bob" or "foundation" or "coin x team" can change the rules as they like. You don't want a single point of failure. "Bobs, foundations, and teams can be bribed, threatened, imprisoned, or killed.

Premined means coins were just issued. Without mining. All bitcoins were mined. Granted, the initial blocks were very easy to find since difficulty was low. Only a few people knew or cared about mining bitcoin then.
While today it seems like ultimate slap in the face that satoshi didn't personally email you with instructions to start mining btc on day 1, the reality is no one could have predicted BTC would reach this price. At the beginning, the little tokens were worthless, no one knew about them, nobody accepted them for anything, there were no wallets, no exchanges, nothing. It was barely usable project for programming inclined people.

Hardware wallets store a seed. 12 words or more. The keys are generated from the seed. There is a private key for each address. It is required to spend btc. You backup the seed words somewhere else secretly or memorize them. If hardware wallet is lost or stolen you can recover it with seed words. The upside to have it is if there is a split you can follow instructions to get both coins. With coinbase they might give you only one or none since they control the keys.

TLDR: Bitcoin is worth $50.
"So he goes to CoinDesk to exchange a total amount of $1 million. Let's also assume that all the miners have been hoarding their bitcoins and there are only ten bitcoins whose owner is willing to sell. And let's also say that there are no other buyers or sellers in this day."
WTF? Coindesk is not an exchange. And no coins to sell is as silly to assume as with any stock shares.
"So now this $1 million is fighting for 10 bitcoins. And in order to fill the order, the price would have to shoot up to $100,000 per bitcoin. So now the market cap is $100,000 * 16.5 million bitcoins, right? That would be a market cap of $1.65 trillion. But there was only an inflow of $1 million, which is a fraction of $1.65 trillion. "

I don't have a ledger. But, I think the 2nd "account" is the same as what ledger wallet has so you see the same balance. It's possible that you may not be able to spend anything from that 2nd "account" without getting out your ledger. You could remove the 2nd account from mycelium probably. I am not sure, maybe it has to stay there. Try to see if you can send anything from 2nd account in mycelium and see if it asks you to reach for the ledger before sending. Before deleting anything make a backup of your seeds (word lists) and store them safely. Someone sees the words the coins are gone. If you lose the words the coins are gone.
You pay mining fee for all transactions which occur on the blockchain. There are no "accounts" in bitcoin. mycelium and ledger accounts are sets of keys that the app and device manage for you and call them accounts. Anytime you send bitcoin from address controlled by one key to address controlled by another key that goes through the miners and fee needs to be paid.

It would take a hard fork with everyone agreeing to upgrade to new version. Obviously miners with millions worth of sha256 equipment will be against it as it would turn the boxes into paperweights. So in practical terms no.
And further, lets say there were tons of people saying they are ready with their GPU rigs for new algo client and will start mining right away. It's not possible to tell how much hash power is available. So difficulty would have to be adjusted in the same fork to prevent a situation where blocks are found once a day for instance. The next diff recalc will take a long time and chain well be bogged down with unconfirmed transactions. And with relatively lower hash power the gov and banks will step in, take over 51% and permanently kill trust in bitcoin and any pow coin to follow it. In practical terms, again, I don't see how bitcoin could survive algorithm change.

Just put some data in the computer, mail out bills, and collect money. (Also pay claims.) Insurance is a cash cow, if the actuaries do their risk pricing right and the brand has healthy image. Once he got the cash rolling in, investing it here and there must not have been all that difficult. He totally missed growth in the tech sector, other than IBM, because he claims he didn't understand it. And, he's been in cahoots with wall street insiders for years. Oracle my ass.

Don't forget to give 1/3 to the taxman.

Government can legally compel you to provide a fingerprint to unlock it.

No currency specified so assuming BTC. You'll need 1 million BTC to be a millionaire.

Amazon card on egifter.com and the rest is easy. Purse.io is an option too.

Some people still, in 2017, believe that this literally happened.

Agreed with first part but the 2nd is somewhat tinfoil hat. Which individual or company can set the market exactly?
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:08:18
Sure. Using btc is optional if other means are adequate.

The margins are at record high. Coins bought on margin need to be sold or interest will accrue in perpetuity. They could be sold slow into rising market. Or fast dropping us below $2000. I've got some buy orders in $2100 range. If they hit - great, if they don't - no harm no foul.

I'm not OP. See the fiat sign in the Title?

Depends on which version of the wallet it was made in probably. It can be extended to more than 12 in current version, but default is 12.

Don't know about emails. Those are not reliable. What is important is confirmation of transaction getting mined into a block. You need to observe this with a block explorer.

Don't listen to this person. I am properly trained in BTC disposal with 20 years of experience. None of my customers ever see those pesky BTC again. Once I've removed it, it's permanent. Happy customers all over the world write nothing but praise, describing how they happily gave up chart watching and price crash worries. They got back to binge eating, binge tv watching, alcohol and prescription pill abuse, and seething hate of their meagerly paying jobs.

The other way. Everyone should carry around relatively easy to check smartphone wallet with no more than $50 worth of btc in it.

That's a long time. Wouldn't the lettuce get bad way before then? I'm just saying.

It's an empty post with zero substance. Adds nothing of value. Yes, all bulls are happy when the price goes up. All bears are happy when it goes down. It's like saying I woke up today. I ate and drank. I breathed in air and blinked all day. &lt;insert crazy Lewis Black headshake here&gt; So fucking what!

If I send $5 from address with 10BTC, does it count as $30000 was sent? It probably does so this metric is misleading.
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:47:08
BTC 2635 yesterday. BTC 2345 today. Did miners start using less electricity because price changed?

Buy from US marshals. Tim is grinning ear to ear now I bet.
