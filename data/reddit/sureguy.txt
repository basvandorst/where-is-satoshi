Look on the positive side, if she catches you she just lost $10000

I guess the difference is you can access your bitcoins from pretty much anywhere (spending them, or converting them is often a different story).  This isn't true of cash in banks.  Your bitcoin isn't really susceptible to civil forfeiture.  I can kind of see the point with that mindset, but it's a bit of a stretch.
In cases like this he should have opened an account at one of the larger banks (not an american, but I know those exist) that have branches in both places, and then transferred, or wrote a cheque between the banks.  Civil forfeiture isn't new, and I'm aware of it even though I'm not a citizen

What does that have to do with what I said?  I was just pointing out that apple has this ability.  I didn't say they'd done it, just that they could.  I honestly think that's something people should be aware of, on any platform.

While I don't care much one way or the other, reddit is a free marketplace of ideas, but it's split into different subreddits.  If people didn't at least attempt to post to the correct subreddits think about how unusable the site would be.

Is this like when RIM (Blackberry) didn't see the iPhone as a threat to their business?
Even if you don't think they are direct competition, you have to prepare for the next iteration.

This is correct.  Apple has a kill switch they can use do uninstall/disable apps, they have had it for years.

Every Mt. Gox gif should probably link to something "I don't know what I'm doing" related.

The problem is that other people are.  It makes crypto currencies look suspicious, even if it has nothing to do with the currency.  
Many people aren't willing to put the time in to secure themselves.  A quick look at the top 10 most common weak passwords confirms this.

 Then difficulty would go way up making it nearly impossible to mine anything with these.

I never recommend anyone buy bitcoin.  I don't want to be the scapegoat if it crashes for some reason, especially if  they stupidly over-extend themselves.  
What I will do, when splitting cheques (for dinner), or joint gift purchases, is offer to reimburse with Bitcoin.  Then they have a choice, an easy way in (I'll help them set up a wallet), and are only risking $20-100 at most.

I'm not an American, I'm a Canadian (Sorry?).  But even if this wasn't the case,  my government, your government, and all sorts of other governments were all colluding to do this exact thing, and obfuscating it with loopholes.  Our governments are not operating in our best interest, and there doesn't appear to be much we can do to stop it.
We live in a truly sad era.

How would you compare the firmware if it's plugged into a USB condom?

It depends on the person.  I once used an ATM (in Canada) and there was a withdrawal slip left in the machine, they had $300K in the chequing account.
It might have been before a large asset purchase.
Some people are highly suspicious of any sort of investment that ties up their cash, even a higher interest account that has a withdrawal window that is not immediate.

15 years ago a lot of the free smtp servers were probably also blind relays, the malware/viruses certainly were.   There was a good reason that ISPs did what they did.  I repaired several virus ridden machines that had their upstream totally choking their connection because it was spamming 24/7 as part of a botnet.

If I want to know where my nearest bitcoin ATM is, I just have to wait for a scam call from India pretending to be the Canada Revenue Agency (Canada's version of the IRS), and if I play along, they'll tell me where it is so I can send the money I "owe" to them using it.
It's a convenient service, although I have to deal with them swearing at me at the end of the call.

But in the EU that means no customs (as far as I know), and also no boat in the ocean, or huge land travel.
@_date: 2015-09-01 05:42:32
because you don't want web services running on client nodes.  I would assume they block some other common ports (25, 443, 21, amongst others)

Might as well extract the money from their user base while they still have one, I guess.

How fast are you getting your Trezor devices?  In Canada, it took more than 2 weeks.  I have to assume it'd be faster in European countries, but that doesn't help if I'm travelling to China, Australia, USA or anywhere else that's far away from Europe.

I sometimes suspect someone has convinced a proprietor to embrace the system, and then once a transaction works they figure it's working, and no longer have any support.  
If enough transactions fail, staff will simply say "It's not working."
In Canada Radio Shack was bought by The Source, and all the stores are still "The Source" but I think it's been shuttered in the States).  By my parent's place I've tried to buy gift cards for the google play store, itunes, etc.  For more than 9 months the machine "has been down", I'm not checking daily, but there were 4 weeks that every Sunday I checked, as they were the only business where I could find stock for google play store cards.  Now I just check to see if it's still "not working".  I have to assume this isn't a systemic thing, and either laziness, or lack of training.
Their website lists the cards as being in stock, and you can see them in the store.  So it's even worse.

There is lag, and some firms have run their own cable (as a pseudo backbone), that is physically more risky, but as a result physically shorter and thus faster, to take advantage of faster trades.  
A faster computer, with a faster connection has an advantage.  The companies that have computers that do thousands if not hundreds of thousands of transactions per second are aware of this, and have invested serious resources to exploit this.

A killer app that maintains security for a user means that it's not really secure.  The fact of the matter is that people need to understand security, and employ it properly.  Many  people will provide you with their passwords if you sound official, or according to one study, offer them chocolate

I agree, unfortunately the person who implemented the solution is to blame, not the customer or the proprietor.  At the very best the person responsible for implementation has not explained things properly.  That's a problem.

If your option is inflating the price or never seeing the money, I don't see how that really a choice.

Since they're asking for money before having a product, I'd have to agree it's a scam.

Those are technically the same factor.  If someone has physical access to your computer, or a key logger has been installed there are ways they could gain access to your account.  The method you are describing provides a single point of failure that once compromised, causes a complete breakdown in security.
The two most common forms of 2FA are:
* Something you have (like a phone with google authenticator via SMS or the App, a Yubikey or something similar)
* Something you know (like your password)
* Something you are (your fingerprint, or an iris scan, or some other biometric)
* Something you know (like your password)
