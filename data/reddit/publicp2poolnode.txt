My thoughts exactly :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:50:32
I know it sounds impulsive but I've been following bitcoin for a long time and really believe its a good investment. 
I am planning on paying off all of my debts with the first 20k and using whatever is left, maybe 30k to invest into bitcoin. 
Hopefully a few years from now ill look back and be very happy I took the risk. If not, I'm still young enough to make up for it. Thank you for your concern though :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:37:10
Actually I looked at the link you posted... What do they know about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:49:32
I don't think I'm a bitch... I truly was obsessed and didn't give her the attention she deserved. Mining was a bad decision and took away all of my attention from her. I recognize how it would have felt and apologized. 
That's what a real man would do.

I don't see myself as being homeless if this goes south. I can afford a rental home. Besides my credit card interest is very high and I'd pay that off with half of my equity and use the other half for this investment.
Yeah it would suck if I was wrong about this... But if I'm right...
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:06:03
Sounds like reasonable advice when buying stocks, but I feel that time is of the essence, especially with second market bringing the bitcoin fund to the Nasdaq at the end of this year. I really feel that we are on the verge of a major upswing :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:56:05
I understand that. But if I'm right what better future could I offer my kids. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:28:26
P2poolserver.us is another option :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:11:48
Lol :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:07:42
It would suck to lose it all, but this isn't an uneducated decision, thanks for the advice though :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:01:32
I know it sounds crazy... I just really think that a year from now the price will be at least double what it is now. 
My girlfriend and I want to live together and this house is too small for our half ass Brady bunch, and I know we wouldn't qualify for a new home right now without selling this one first. 
So we decided to rent a larger home which leaves me with the option to rent my first home out and worry about someone trashing it or to pay off my high interest credit card debts and take a risk putting it all into bitcoin. 
I truly have been obsessed with following all the news good and bad and the only thing that worries me is a 51 percent attack which is very bothersome but other than that I see nothing but positive news and think this is a wise decision. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:18:52
Have you ever heard of the secret? If I plan on it going to zero it will. 
I am going to secret that it takes off like I think it will. 
Positive thinking :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:53:45
I wouldn't know how to set it up though. I plan on using a realtor and don't know of any that could set that up. I will probably just sell it the conventional way and buy through coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 09:00:28
I don't think this is an aw fuck it moment... This is more like a getting back up, brushing yourself off and moving forward moment. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:40:54
Lol, you should be a doctor, I actually do have add although my depresion is gone after my wife left me. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:31:21
What's wrong with kids living in a rental?
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:06:54
Lol, I'm not a troll. Ill be listing my house in August And investing in bitcoin as soon as I get the money from the sale :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:49:10
I used to be a gambler, this is true... I look at this differently than gambling though.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:10:57
I promise That's not a concern! Money isn't everything, life is precious and my kids mean the world to me :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:51:16
Trust me I'm not trying to pump the value of it until I sell my house!
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:43:19
That is a definate concern, but from what I've read some of the smartest people have looked at it and the only concern is from a 51 percent attack. This is a real concern though. Especially with ghash being as big as it is. That is truly my only concern. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:58:08
Because I don't know how... I don't own it, I am just making mortgage payments to the bank. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:57:18
Yes you are right... But I can always rent a home. Why do I need to own one? Sure the tax write off is good but from what I've been reading I am very excited where this is going...
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:27:33
Lol, I think it's so funny that a few of you think I'm a troll. 
Am I really that crazy to believe in bitcoin like I do? 
I know the guys at work think I'm nuts cause it's all I can talk about but I thought here I would find like minded people who believe like I do. 
Although I do appreciate all the advice I'm getting both pro and con bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:08:59
Hopefully ill buy it back with satoshis :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:24:21
I don't have the goldfish or the cats lol, and no if it went south and she deemed me financially incompetent it absolutely would not be worth it! The six weeks we were apart was absolutely horrible. I was so obsessed with mining and setting up my own pool and reading about all the news about bitcoin that she felt like she didn't matter to me and decided to leave. 
After she left I did everything I could to get her back and apologized for being so obsessed and told her she meant the world to me. 
The other day she told me that she believed in me and wanted me to do whatever I thought was right and that she would support whatever decision I made. 
This made me very happy and I decided I'm going to do it. 
God I hope this is a good decision, I really feel it is though :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:28:45
No I don't think that there not wishing hard enough. Have you eve read the secret? It's not about wishing, it's about believing :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 01:53:09
That would be a good idea... I know some high dollar homes have been listed for bitcoin, I wonder how I'd set up something like that? Wouldn't I have to own the house outright to accept bitcoin in payment for the home? Cause the bank would want to have their money before they signed off on me selling the home...
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:55:32
They almost talked me out of it... I talked with my girlfriend again tonight to make sure that if I lose it all she won't think I'm a dockyard like someone else mentioned in this post and walk away. She pinky swore that she won't be upset if I'm wrong and we plan on getting married next year! I love this girl! 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:04:38
I'm not pissed of about all the money and time wasted from mining, I look at it as a learning curve.
To be honest I wanted to buy bitcoin when it was $160 but I couldn't buy with a credit card, however I could buy mining equipment with a credit card.
I owe about $10,000 from the mining equipment that is worthless a few months later. 
And I don't believe I'm a moron, I truly believe this is a wise decision. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:54:54
Hmm... What benefit would I have by lying?
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:38:57
So if I have kids I shouldn't make an educated decision to invest to potentially have a more secure future?
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:35:46
I only learned about trolls a few months ago and don't know too much about them other than they like to have fun and mess with people who they don't like. Not sure why they would foam at the mouth over a post like this though...
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:30:31
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:29:58
Actually that's not why, but I took the reference to my p2pool node off :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:53:20
She is my girlfriend and she left recently because I was so obsessed on the mining and setting up my p2pool node and that's all I could talk about or think about. 
I am done mining now and going about it differently now. 
Much easier to just buy than to mine. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:10:54
Sound advice... I am going to pay off all of my debts, credit, car, etc, and may hold back 5k for emergencies. That should leave me with 25k to invest into btc 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:23:52
Good news used to drive the price up dramatically as did bad news. As of the last few months there has been so much good news yet the price remains the same. 
Several news stories that Broke a few months ago resulting in the price dropping have changed including apple allowing digital currency apps and Russia easing their policies. 
Plus so many other good news that haven't affected the price much lately. 
When Wall Street gets involved which they will soon...

I also have a 0% node in the u.s.a.

What drives me to life is to become conscious and to be present.
My most important observation in life is that outflow determines inflow. Abundance, whether that be wealth, love, respect, time, e.t.c. comes to those who give freely that which they want and do not worry about that which they do not have.
p.s., I started mining in November after investing 800 for a 30gh, then 4,600 in january for a 230gh, and $2200 in february for a 200gh miner. Then march i invested another 3000 and bought coins from coinbase and amassed a little over 9 bitcoin, of which I just lost all of it by renting hashpower from leaserig and pointing the hashing power at bitsolo in hopes of solo mining my first block, unfortunately I managed to lose every coin I had in possession. 
I've decided not to be unhappy about it because being unhappy about it would only bring me another layer of unhappiness.

I'm beginning to not like you very much.
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:11:36
Thank you! This is the spirit I'm looking for! I'm very excited to see where this goes!
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:42:07
Why worry about buttheads?
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:50:09
Wow, that is really sad and humbling, makes me wonder if this is the right decision. I wouldn't want to lose my girl... She says she believes in me... Hopefully she will no matter what the outcome. Thanks for sharing :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:04:12
My heart tells me this is the right decision. Thanks for the advice :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:07:33
How many bitcoins do you own?
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:41:03
Thank you... I was starting to doubt myself lol
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:53:54
Thank you :)
I used to have a problem with gambling and alcohol, this is a gamble for sure and I realize that, but I think it's different than slot machines. I have done a lot of research on this so to me it's an educated gamble. 
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:18:56
Which is my exact reason for thinking time is of the essence :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 08:48:09
Nothing worth anything comes easily and without risk...
@_date: 2014-07-07 07:08:04
Talked it over with my girlfriend again. I am going forward with it :)
@_date: 2014-07-06 03:29:56
I can't wait until I can come back here a few years from now and tell of my success story. I'm not a troll, I really am going to do this.
