Don't pay any attention to that sub, it's full of degenerates and communist mods.

Honestly doing the bank/ACH transfer is a complete waste of time. If you're using coinbase, doing the debit card is the only way to go. You get your coin almost instantly, ACH transfer is just a huge no no.

I feel like a lot of people just FOMO'd the shit out of BCH and are about to lose money.

I dont think so, I think a lot of people assumed they were buying it at $3,000 yesterday and getting that gigantic $5k+ profit from it hitting $8,400 when in reality it dropped back to $3,100 after it unfroze. It was a pure FOMO/hype move and I don't think people are going to make the same mistake today but I could be wrong. My BTC is staying put.

Because it doesn't look cool. Real talk though I'd rather just put that $79 it costs into BTC lol, I'm fine with my offline paper wallet.

Pretty much exactly how I feel about it, just like the thread about the person cashing out the 1.2 btc he found on a hard drive. Maybe he's not interested in cryptocurrency and is just one of the passerbys that saw the headlines in the media, decided to check his pockets, and found some extra money. People here expect every single person on the planet who own any crypto to be exactly as diligent as they are, if that was the case, people wouldn't be poor. To some people $17,000 is a fuck ton of money to just "find", they might need it right then and there. If I had one right now I'd cash it out and give it to my father whose house was flooded by the recent Hurricane in Houston, people have different priorities, I cant believe it's so hard to understand.

I mean they might lock your price in, but my point was you can get your bitcoin or unit ordered in your account within minutes and start trading instead of having to wait up to 7 days sometimes (based off individual experiences). I'd much rather have it at my fingertips to do with as I please instead of waiting.

It took me over a week to bank transfer $9,100 so maybe you should just give it a little bit more time for 1.8 million dollars?

What exactly does you not giving a shit about someone have to do with the rest of us? Speak for yourself, there's no worshiping going on, but if people showcase their success, it's going to keep Bitcoin in the spotlight and continue to motivate people to keep their money in the game. You know the guy Tai Lopez? He's spews the most obvious bullshit you could easily look up yourself and might be a con man, but he's indirectly helping increase bitcoin as well by trending on social media, and other media outlets. Don't mistake that for worshiping.

I think this is a bit of an over reaction lol, they said they'd be adding BCH a while ago and they did. Coinbase is staying on my phone because I don't think there is another app that is as easy to use and easy to monitor my funds while on the go. I rarely sit at my computer and trade, so it's been great for me. I would agree they need to continuously improve their uptime during spikes but it's gotten better IMO. I was still able to buy LTC yesterday on the dip so I came out happy.

You're being a huge asshole right now. Whether or not the $30 disappears into thin fucking air or turns into $31, the fact that his wife noticed that he enjoyed something so much that she gifted him an entrance into his interest. Fuck off with your shit negativity ya knob.

Or you know, you can do whatever you want because its your money in the end and whatever decision you feel comfortable with is what you should do.

The last time someone said this it was "never below 9500 again, mark my words" and then a day later it went lower than that.

The most annoying aspect of this is friends whom have jumped on the bandwagon after talking to me about it. I don't give any financial advice out to them, as I'm not a financial advisor. But yet they still think it's a good idea to message me "I don't know why I listened to you, I shouldn't have put any money into this I'm just losing it." I literally have stopped entirely talking about it to friends, it's just too annoying to deal with.
