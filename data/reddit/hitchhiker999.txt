Know the technology. This illustration shows clearly what it means to sell something that is no longer needed. You can't sell apples at a marked up price next to apple trees.
The governments are selling an inflated &amp; corrupt financial instrument, it must not be allowed to continue.
If you are interested (in the technology), I suggest you start here:

I don't think *you* understand.

The problem is that would be like _literally_ ridding the planet of apple trees - they're not THAT powerful.

..depends what news you are reading.

Your point is fair, thanks for the clarification.
btw: I hope you read that guide anyway (i'm a dev of 36 years, in b.c. apps  for 9 years - that guide is a lovely technical overview that helped clarify some stuff for me!)
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:03:22
yes yes it is like that completely. Explain yourself.

They're selling a value proposition, the markets are rife with bullshit / corruption / distortion. The instrument is NOT corrupt. Read about the tech.

..also relatively impossible as a hypothesis, at least in the long term. You can't control something 'easily' that doesn't actually have a central control point. Hence 'decentralisation' is the new revolution.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:13:04
..very true, as I said 'long term', but we're not talking about just Bitcoin when we say 'bitcoin'.. the term is currently conflated with crypto. You can't buy them all out, and you certainly can't do that with a debt based currency.
Also, with decentralisation the exit/entry points are distributed widely (see Tor)
You can try though. They have been making it harder and harder for the last 8 years.
Ironically the slowdown may have helped support a very volatile proposition from exploding in on itself.

Until we finish removing centralised services such as DNS, yes there IS a kill switch. You are probably not technically proficient, don't berate unless you know what you are talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:27:10
I see what you did there.

No, this is about technology facilitating a change in economic processes. 
Learn about that technology, then you can understand what options are now available within the economic realm. Or don't, completely up to you. 
I'm not interested in proving a point to a random person on the internet, I'm interested in capable economists / technologists / entrepreneurs learning about the most startling movement in society since the internet.

Calling somebody a 'fucking bipedal urinal-goblin hybrid' is not sexism or misogyny. You are (as far as can be determined) experiencing gender equality and being insulted simultaneously.
Rather than equating this behaviour with 'men' (which is gender bias), equate that with 'idiots' (which is reasonable).

A lot of us cared about bitcoin when it was less than 1 cent, now we need to explain it to others. Hence the annoying, loud and persistent noise from anyone involved.
"It's a social revolution, wrapped up as a get rich quick scheme"
Your choice to pay attention, or not.
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:01:48
Unfortunately good advice, though we need better solutions (for newcomers) than this.

..fade away JP.

It's not hard to take shots at people excited by a revolution. 
You'll probably find, however that it is justified. *Though hard to stomach for the more jaded among us.*
Understandable. Learn about the tech first, if that's of interest to you:

I've been working with the blockchain for 8 years. Decentralised tech for 20, and programming for 36 years.
I think you may have perhaps been misunderstood. Anyway:
- Blockchain comes under 'decentralised' tech.
- Decentralisation (in IT) = ANY process that doesn't rely on a central authority, including authentic blockchain technologies.

and igaming companies.
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:02:00
nicely said, I've been having this debate with people recently. There isn't much to it, the exchange 'value' (for goods/services) is going to be the clincher, these numbers only reflect 'attention' for now.

Malta is partly off-shore, and full of foreign igaming companies, it's most likely the Russians, Brits or Americans behind it. It's as much a den of thieves as anywhere else.

Thank you for not caring. The reasonable voices tend to get buried under each new layer of 'general population' that hauls its lost, violent and fear-based-self onto the party.
/sorry general population, but you know it's true.

The price of BTC is what it was last week.. so anything before then and BTC was profit, anything after was loss (until next week).

Bitcoin was the vehicle that allowed the rapid accumulation of wealth from remote givers, and easy transfer of almost fee-less micro-transactions to his 'wallet'. The currency was converted to USD to make the final transaction with the food merchant.
