I notice you mention coinjar charging gst in the Australian Bitcoin exchanges section. My understanding is that they don't do this anymore after moving to the UK

As an Australian what is the best course of action then to avoid the taxes? Can I assume it is to buy at overseas exchanges that take Australian dollars such as Coinjar and then only spend the Bitcoin overseas to avoid the taxes?

And Australia just hit 900 AUD a bitcoin. Loving life right now.

As a dual US/Aussie citizen. I would take the ATO over the IRS any day of the week. They have been way ahead of the IRS on clarifying crypro regulation, the tax code is not completely convoluted and senseless and they don't have mandatory minimum 10,000 usd penalties when you forget to file a form. 
Also FBAR and FACTA are an absolute joke that poses a real threat to crypto users. The form 8949 is an absolute joke if you do any volume. 
In the US you don't even get a written acknowledgment you have actually lodged your taxes, you just have to assume that if you haven't heard from them you are good. In Australia you get a written acknowledgment that actually breaks down what your taxes and spent on as well as an online portal to makes it easy to review your previous returns. 
The IRS makes the ATO look like a fairy godmother.

Would it be smarter to buy a few and spread your bitcoin out or just put them all in one?

Thanks mate. That really clears up the confusion. Appreciate the post.

Sorry mate I live in the real world. I wholeheartedly support bitcoin but it's ridiculous telling people close their bank accounts in protest.
