That clears everything up, thanks a lot.

Oh yeah, I forgot that you have to link previous transactions for a new transaction. At what point is the fact that I don't have enough money noticed. Assuming the wallet doesn't verify that, how does the bitcoin protocol detect that? How does that part work? I'm finding it difficult to understand the magic that's going on at a low level.

So I get that they'll be rejected once broadcasted to the blockchain but what prevents offline invalid transactions from going through? Is it possibly for someone to program their own wallet to make invalid transactions? So the wallet would falsify the input transactions. Obviously they'd be rejected when broadcasted but if the transaction is made offline, the receiver doesn't realise that it is invalid right? Sorry for pestering you, I appreciate the help.

Yeah I know it's a silly question, just purely theoretical. I'm having difficulty understanding the low level logic.
What is preventing someone doing this right now though? From the example, let's just say a malicious individual wrote their own wallet that didn't verify how much they have. I know that there is internet access everywhere nowadays but wouldn't something like that make bitcoin harder to use in rural areas or third world countries? That would inhibit bitcoin adoption no? 
I know I've misunderstood something. Where have I made a mistake?
