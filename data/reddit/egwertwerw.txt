buy more
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:59:59
no. but you can afford it, just buy less.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:43:50
Maybe try  - possibly using an RBC US account; 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:27:32
not really.

Interviewer looks so bored heh

This could be a short term risk, yeah.. if all the major exchanges start doing LN between each other that'll be a huge chunk of all transactions. Eventually it will catch up again, but might take a few more years.

i have.. my conclusion was that it was only slightly less of a waste of time than faucets.. that said a big warehouse of GPUs might have enough economies of scale to make it worthwhile.. but I still think it's more likely sberbank is using them for AI.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:59:17
maybe  - tbh their cs never replied so can't say they're great, but they did fix my issue.

This makes it sound like you didn't just go to the withdrawal screen on your account and withdraw the funds? Are the funds still in your kraken account now? Maybe try that..

Banks do this already to some extent (extend credit to each other) - but only so much and then you need some other system to balance the accounts. That other system is often the central bank.. they pay each other through the central bank and receive fiat on account at the central bank. The central bank clearing systems already function much like a cryptocurrency.. although they currently run on traditional databases there's no reason they couldn't move to a blockchian.. The singapore central bank recently released a paper on a research project they did to explore this exact possibility;

They probably will eventually. You may not even need to do anything. It does say on the deposit form  "Deposits must be sent from accounts that match your verified legal name."

he obviously won't.. the problem is that if he gets given temporary possession of it, he'll be heavily taxed on it.. and then once he has the money it'll be open season for the creditors to sue him.. and then the money will be locked up again pending the resolution of the various lawsuits. by the time he's able to give it back there won't be much left.

bitstamp does not have limits.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:00:36
maybe.. normally arbitrage would take care of that.. but I guess one thing that could happen is that the futures would divert capital that would otherwise have gone into bitcoin.. and then maybe the CME forces cash settlement at some fake price later defrauding the futures investors.. but also negatively impacting the price of btc by tricking them into not investing in btc directly.

The only deposit mechanism is wire transfer, which has no limits. They also require full passport scans and residency/address verification. If you start transacting large amounts they will probably also start demanding source of funds documentation.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:55:23
The cash deposit options on [localbitcoins.com]( are often fairly good value.. there's a few under 5%. I'd recommend getting a passport though.

The idea would be that they receive USD locally in Taiwan.. if people want to send USD from outside Taiwan they first have to get it into Taiwan themselves. Perhaps tether has some other shell companies setup to facilitate this (receive USD at XYZ Importing Trade Pty Ltd, send to Tether) or maybe they have a friendly bank account opening team so their customers can easily setup their own Taiwanese bank accounts. Or maybe it's all fraud.. I have no idea.

If it were a wallet where the keys were stored on the phone (likely) there is no way to recover them without the phone or the backup passphrase/seed.
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:13:35
not really.. easier to setup a vpn/tunnel to get around the blockage than a satellite dish.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:04:50
honestly GPUs are much better suited to AI than cryptos these days.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:43:47


That may be the problem right there. You're not allowed to send money from 3rd party accounts.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:51:24
no. what Revolut has has done is block transfers from people who didn't enable an EUR IBAN account.. they did that mainly because bitcoin exchanges won't accept transfers other than from an IBAN account in the same name as the customer. If you send funds from Revolut to an EUR account without first openign a Revolut IBAN account, the funds appear to come from 'The Currency Cloud' and will be rejected by the bitcoin exchange as a 3rd party transfer. As long as you have activated an EUR IBAN account transfers to/from Revolut to bitcoin exchanges will not be blocked.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:37:40
revolut.com make sure you enable the EUR IBAN account.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:34:03
they may ask you to unlock it.. they can also copy it or just keep it and not give it back to you.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:54:39
yup
