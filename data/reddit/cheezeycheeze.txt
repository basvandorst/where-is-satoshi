I know they are listening with my phone, my PC and my online accounts. What are they going to do that they can't already do? 
I don't do anything worth looking into. 
They know my taxes, they know my job, they know my education, they know my home address. The government knows everything about me and I have no ability to stop it. What am I going to do, go off the grid? For what? To struggle for privacy? For what? So they don't know when I am doing something? What am I doing that is so interesting? Nothing. I sit here, read some stuff, watch some shows, go to work, come home. A few times I will go to a movie or go on a date. So? What are they going to do to an average person who just does nothing? I travel and I tell the government where I am going, and why so I get pre-checked. They can look at my bank account, great I bought groceries, a video game, or PC parts. Nothing important.

Why do you think there will be "enviable DISSIDENT"?

What do you see happening that would send the US into "enviable DISSIDENT"? 
Trump won because of Gerrymandering which has happened for years. They lobbied the laws to be this way and people can't do anything? They can't touch the elite so what "enviable DISSIDENT" will the people do? Riot? That just hurts themselves and other middle class/ lower class people. We can't touch their money. We can't touch their businesses without hurting ourselves. They will keep the police and military feed and happy to keep the masses in place. I see no way that middle class people will do anything because there is so little they can do. 
Boycott? They can't boycott the Mega Corporations (Nestle  because they need food, and need houses, and the utilities( utilities which are ok). 
You don't "need" a cell phone, people just want them, the government makes it law that you can get a cheap reliable land line that is it. You don't "need" internet, and the government is so slow that if you lost it due to not having enough money they won't bring prices down. 
Medical is all a scam unless you are dying. Then they will save you and stick you will a huge bill. 
College is a "choice" not a right. So if you get in massive debt, or can't go because you can't afford it, the government says "tough luck" because this is how Education is ran. If you have kids and you are mad about the education, then earn more money because the government elected that crazy woman, because Trump won. So you can't change it. Only thing you can do is hope you make enough to take your kids to a private school if private schools are still around with that crazy woman. 
You want renewable resources instead of natural gas, coal and oil? Tough luck you don't choose that. We can just hope whatever Obama did before the end of his term takes effect. But honestly Big Oil Lobbied it to be this way. And it looks like Russia needs Big Oil to stay in power. 
I could go on and on about the problems we all face, but face it, Big Evil Corporations are in control. If you Riot you just hurt yourself, and other Middle Class/ Lower Class people. You will never touch the Billionaires or their money. They will just run away to a different country on their private helicopters and private jets until we kill ourselves or stop. I don't see people attacking or anything because they won't be able to do anything so why do it?

Can you please explain what you think will happen? I cannot see why the government would care about anything a normal user would do?

Like the other guy said, unless you kept it, you would have probably sold it too soon. Don't dwell on it. Have a great day!

What are your thoughts on America trying to police the world?
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:48:43
But what about the geopolitical stuff he was talking about? And what about the idea of taking the power away from the Fed/Banks?
