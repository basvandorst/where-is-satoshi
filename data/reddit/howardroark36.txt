in this case, they delay delivering bitcoins while still accepting payment

i had the same problem.  i decided to join a mining pool to get my first (fraction of a) bitcoin

* bitcoin has been in a bubble
* bitcoin hasn't responded as quickly as other markets
i predict a bounce in 3 days to a week

i don't want the amount of money i make to be dependent on how well frns are doing at the moment either

where is this?  the site says that it is forcing those with simple passwords to update them

if you're serious about buying food - i'm selling plums and squash for bitcoins now, and i'll have tomatoes coming in the next week or two
@_date: 2011-07-06 06:10:11
i'm not sure that the problems you mention occur in an (almost) infinitely divisible currency.  there should be enough for both trade and "hoarding" (saving)
@_date: 2011-08-05 18:18:24
there's a site that currently lets you pay for amazon using bitcoins
@_date: 2011-05-25 03:14:40
it's much more likely that will happen to frns than bitcoins.  but i'd use my savings of gold, silver, food, etc that i bought using bitcoins to find another job (who wants to work for a boss who tells you to "suck it"?)
@_date: 2011-06-05 17:05:27
depends on her current payment processing scheme.  she could just accept emails with "from" bitcoin addresses and physical addresses.  then when payment arrives she sends her product
update: she would need to advertise her receiving bitcoin address

i'm looking for boutique buyers (i should have mentioned that).  this is all organic and excellent quality if you get it fast enough (so quick/expensive shipping is important if you're not local).  i had two squash, a cocozelle, and plums for dinner tonight and it was amazing.  have you ever had zucchini that is nectar dripping fresh?  it's a completely different taste than what you get in the store

you don't seem to have a firm grasp on (austrian) economics, so i'm not sure i can help you.  if you start off poor in any system it's going to suck, but inflation usually hurts the poor the most because they tend to keep the greatest percent of their worth in cash
the loans of money that are "created from nothing" are actually taken from the cash savings of others through inflation
@_date: 2011-08-15 03:48:19


fair enough
@_date: 2011-05-25 03:39:08
bitcoins are volatile currently - but like gold the general trend against frns is up because there is a finite number of them.  and i think they will be less volatile over time.  frns are volative too - just look at gas, food, gold, and silver

the swiss franc is the only exception i know of - it's backed by 40% gold reserves
the gold dinar was being introduced in libya, which is part of the reason they have bombs falling on them
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:22:20
i'm pretty sure those things exist.  for example, silk road has a reputation system and is an exchange.  deepbit is a mining pool
@_date: 2011-06-13 05:53:09
java is fine, and it's a general purpose language.  but you might want to choose a language that's good at what you want to do - for example, groovy and grails or ruby on rails for web apps;  objective c for iPhone apps; etc

i know there's a site that uses google checkout.  used to be paypal sites, but i think they started using dwolla
@_date: 2011-06-19 18:07:05
this happened last weekend, too.  when it happened to silver a while back it was blamed on "low volume manipulation".  in other words: when there aren't a lot of trades, you can create a lot of uncertainty (in silver - or now bitcoin) by selling a lot, driving the price down.  animal spirits or sompin'

it's what i'd call ad-hoc json.  it's about equally bad in all languages, though json stands for javascript object notation, and since you know javascript that should be fine.  what is more important is choosing a good language for the app you want to build

there are already several escrow services

that's what i thought - fractional reserve banking was only possible because we have needed the banks to issue paper to represent stored value (historically gold).  with bitcoin we don't need that
@_date: 2011-07-04 00:34:14
you're not the op - are you interested?  i'm on the left coast but i ship anywhere in the us
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:31:27
please elaborate, i'm not a WoW user.  are you talking about something like the linux (gnome) global key store?  gpg keyring?
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:03:37
you're not going to make money (bitcoins) mining.  but if you move frns to bitcoin you could make money (in nominal terms) holding them

download the client at bitcoin.org.  you can get coins different ways, if you have dollars, mtgox.com is probably the easiest.  don't worry about irc and blocks for now
@_date: 2011-05-25 01:12:38
well, i'd rather get paid in a fixed number of bitcoins - that's kind of the point.  anyway, i'd be game
@_date: 2011-06-12 00:47:35
who would you buy from?  rumors are mtgox short sold the bubble - that's why delivery was delayed
@_date: 2011-09-07 05:13:11
i disagree that people are hoarding, it's just that there aren't enough markets yet, imo
@_date: 2011-05-30 06:25:32
i'm guessing you'll get website biased responses (assuming you posed the same question to the forum)
@_date: 2011-05-25 17:32:18
bitcoins are currently volatile, but i think that will settle down.  if you're really concerned, you could go hybrid (half dollar, half bitcoin) or peg to a basket of commodities (and/or currencies).  i'm personally trying to get out of the dollar and into bitcoins, gold, and silver so it's more attractive to me to be paid in bitcoins since i'd buy them with my dollars anyway

only ventures that have a positive rate of return will be pursued.  in other words, if you can't run a business more efficiently than your competitors you will be denied a loan - which is the way it should work now
a better strategy, given your example, would be to work for bitcoins, saving up until you can start your business.  this is the strategy that is specifically hampered now because any frns become less valuable as you save to start your business
@_date: 2011-05-18 16:43:47
there are other great answers here.  what i would do is look at how much it would cost that day (hour/minute/whatever) to reproduce your product/service (in bitcoins) and add your markup
@_date: 2011-09-07 18:47:37
if i have pesos, but i'm in the us so can't use them, i'm not hoarding them.  i'd be happy to use them i just can't buy anything with them right now
@_date: 2011-05-25 16:19:12
so - frns will definitely slowly lose value over time, but the bitcoins i get paid might appreciate rapidly?  tough choice ;-)
@_date: 2011-07-07 01:28:46
increase difficulty corresponds to more leading 0s
@_date: 2011-06-03 23:50:48


sort of.  if you have deflation of 10%, that means that companies are becoming 10% more efficient (on average, barring loss of coins) - your investment only needs to be average to break even


research would likely be more market focused, but also more effective.  no more shrimp on treadmills (unless a shrimping company thinks that makes a tastier prawn)


it will reward quality investors (as opposed to speculators)

it sounds like someone hacked the db, but the passwords were encrypted.  since it takes a long time to crack non-trivial passwords, the thief probably used the first one that cracked and had significant coins in it

i haven't seen it before, but it looks like it's within the bounds of normality.  you might want to go online and/or restart the application
