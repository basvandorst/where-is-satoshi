There is no middle ground when you say "tax is stupid"
You can say "I wish tax was spent better than it is" 
but saying "tax is stupid" is a stupid comment, and that's what I was replying to.  
Tax money and projects are vital to your everyday life.  You can't just stop it.

If you own a 5mil house then people know you were able to have $1mil liquid cash minimum for downpayment.
They also know you have the cash to pay off the huge mortgage every month.
My point is if you have enough bitcoin to be worried, then you are already rich and can quit your job.
If you aren't rich enough to quit your job then you don't have enough bitcoin to be worried.  There are plenty of bigger fish in the sea that are in plain view.

If you actually have that many bitcoin why are you even working.

Telling people you own a house, car, boat, etc. is not smart either then.
Do you just walk around looking like you are homeless?  Come on dude.
Does every millionaire walk around in fear of a $5 wrench attack? No....
Should you be in fear of a wrench attack cause you own some bitcoin? No.

You are too immature to understand what I'm saying.
You don't tell people where you keep your passwords for your bank account do you?  But you can tell people which bank you use.

Cars get stolen in nice neighborhoods dude.
And keeping a paper wallet in a safe, secure, only can be accessed and is known about by you (aka bank security vault), IS literally a great place to keep it.

If you actually have that much bitcoin then why are you even working.  Take out 10% and live for a few years.  Buy some property and make a nest egg of fiat.
If you can't live for a few years off 10% of your current bitcoin (or buy some property), then you don't have enough to be worried about someone trying to torture you for it.
I feel like people here have 1.5 bitcoin and are thinking "Wow, gonna be a millionaire soon, better not tell my coworkers I'm about to rage quit this bitch and buy a lambo"

Go live in a country where they don't tax you and where when you call the police no one comes, and the road to your house takes 2 hours to go 20 miles.  
Oh and there is no electrical grid, water grid, etc.
I'll choose paying tax

People steel cars all the time.....
Put it in a security deposit in a bank.
There....it's the same as keeping a savings account.  
If you have 1mill in a savings account someone could force you to transfer it.  If you have 1mill in bitcoin in a security deposit in a bank someone could force you to go in the bank and get it.  Same risk. Actually less risk with bitcoin because you would physically have to go to the bank and get away from your attacker, where as you could transfer all the money from your home if it's a savings account.

The general sentiment is that we are crashing down

The cash app doesn't show you the full public address you sent bitcoin to?
Seriously?  Sounds like a terrible app then.  That is some basic bitcoin app/wallet stuff right there.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:36:34
No, this is weird.  Why don't you explain why you refuse to talk about bitcoin in public?
