Doesn't really answer my question. Can you tell me why?

I'm new why is such a high value alt coin a shit coin? Seems like it's doing okay for itself.

Thanks for the thorough and thoughtful response, that helped a lot. Would you recommend one over the other if you could only choose one?

Not to mention how hard it is to get a lightning node up and running. I'd def stick with cash for this too.

Well you need to spend nearly 100 bucks on hardware for starters, and if you don't save the state and don't have a backup you lose all your funds. Tbh it just doesn't seem worth it when on chain transactions work fine.

I don't hear any mention of lightning, when did Satoshi invent that?
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:55:54
That actually doesn't even describe Lightning.

What an interesting way to phrase this.

The reason why it's called btc is because it was started before bitcoin cash forked off. Discussions about raising the bitcoin blocksize would get you banned from here so it was started as an alternative. Now that the fork has happened it remains the largest BCH subreddit for these historical reasons.

1. No, blocksize discussions were explicitly banned. See this post: 
(Emphasis mine)


2 . I don't think it's propaganda reasons, but I can see why one might think that.

Hmm, makes you wonder why don't they just raise the block size so this doesn't happen?
