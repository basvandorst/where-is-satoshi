Plug them in and search for "wallet.dat". If you do I require a finder's fee!

I put mine in Saturday. Where does it show the estimated date?

ACH is not. Its basically like writing a check and they're waiting for it to clear. 
The one that is almost instant is a wire transfer. But there is a $15 fee. My investments are small enough that a $15 fee is too much.

I've been waiting on my deposit to GDAX to clear since Saturday. If it doesn't clear before the next rise I'll be upset.

Wow. That's super shitty. It says Dec 5th...

And I just want to smash my head on the table because I remember installing a miner shortly after bitcoin became a thing. I figured out it would take days/weeks to get one, and they were only worth a couple bucks at most. :(

I kick myself every time some big news about bitcoin comes out. Then I always go to buy some, and there are just so many hoops to jump through I stop before I actually get in. Then I try today and coinbase is down...guess it's just not something for me.

Restarted since installation of AMD APP?

But even if I got verified today I couldn't buy until Friday on coinbase :P
I realized though that my .018BTC from my old mining account is worth over $10!
