Great News! I can't wait to see what this year has to bring!
@_date: 2014-01-06 01:07:09
I don't believe we are spamming. I believe we are in the discussion of helping merchants better understand bitcoin. We appreciate the feedback though! Keep up with the positive energy!
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:14:39
We were here in attendance and it was definitely great being a part of the crowd! Looking forward to more interesting discussions.

He gets millions of downloads for his podcast. He has a great reach and influence for many. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:05:22
Donated a few satoshis!
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:00:31
Will do!

Haha! I Understand what you mean. Normally I use this account to post official news and updates from our service. My official account is BitcoinEnthusiast22. That's where I post my normal comments to other threads.

Most people bad mouthing Joe don't really know what he's about. So I would personally do a reflection on myself as to why I would be talking bad about someone we really don't know. Personally, I think Joe can be a great catalyst for motivation and information being spread across the world. He's got an amazing platform to do so and hope to one day see him sit down with Andreas and have a chat!

This is fantastic news! We can't wait to let businesses know about this! This Is huge! I wouldn't be surprised if espn gets in on the action to report about this! 
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:57:49
Great stuff David! 
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:46:16
That's simply not true. Our service and team speaks for itself. We are really out there speaking with businesses. We have visited 25 businesses in our local area. We hope to begin partnering with some soon.

Oh I hear ya! I'm not saying he's perfect because neither am I but he consistently brings on awesome guests and have great discussions. It's really neat being able to see everyone's different perspectives so it's really beneficial for growth in my opinion. Joe Rogans podcast is a huge service to everyone.

What a great show. I'm beaming with joy over how great Andreas was. It only helps recognizing how passionate we are about bit coin and how truly revolutionary it is! Great podcast.

Didn't seem to get. Where are you located?
@_date: 2014-02-02 01:48:42
We look foward to helping bitcoin Bigfoot spread these brochures directly to these businesses!

I think the best way to communicate the power of bitcoin would be in person where a group of minds can come together and truly collaborate. The internet certainly has its uses in public discussion, but I believe that there is a disconnect when people are communicating to a screen. It can prove to be frustrating at times.
@_date: 2014-01-26 07:39:23
Sounds like a Miami experience to me. Wait till we get a bitcoin convention here at the Los Angeles Convention Center! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:41:13
Check us out! We would definitely spread them around here in Southern California. Check out our website.

The value lies in the public ledger. Something the dollar does not have. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:00:04
I'll be seeing his presentation in Santa Monica later that night!
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:31:58
Any idea where the next venue may be?
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:55:37
Feel free to contact us through email, twitter or on our website if you are in the Southern California area and want to help us and the bitcoin economy!

I think they're all itching to do it secretly. I believe they are waiting for something that just makes the dominos completely fall into place
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:27:29
Spread the word guys! Eventually we want to expand to different states so people will know the BitPros! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:43:06
square space was going through a ddos! It should be back up and running now! go ahead and check it out!
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:00:41
yeah the menu button is just on mobile. square space automatically makes it mobile compatible. But the actual site on desktop has a menu bar.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:05:55
well then we are neither at the moment. Either way, were still going to be here to help businesses.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:26:57
As we establish ourselves in the community we will begin to start taking payments. For now we are doing it to build a reputation and just overall help bitcoin grow. We anticipate monetizing various services we will be offering.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:41:34
Check out our website! We are a team of individuals who are looking to assist small businesses in our area accept bitcoin as a form of payment. We want to help businesses get setup as a recognized bit coin business. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:58:11
Overall it was a really successful day. We went around the 4th street businesses in Long Beach, CA. Its a real hub for small businesses. Just one that bites will have a dramatic effect for the rest. I will be getting in contact with the 4th st business association and seeing what we can do to help make the transition easier for businesses. Overall we visited 17 locations. Most did not know what bitcoin was, but for those that did, I think our short meeting lit a fuse and we fully expect some businesses to take the plunge! Overall it was a successful day.
@_date: 2013-12-30 19:44:45
At this point we have not decided. I would consider ourselves non-profit at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:42:26
Why this has down votes...I don't understand. Our main goal is to help build the bitcoin economy. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:23:21

@_date: 2013-12-24 19:51:07
"likely to pop like a GOOD ol fashion bubble"
@_date: 2013-12-17 08:20:07
We're not charging at the moment. We want to build a relationship with businesses so that they come back to us for further development and advice. So for now it is entirely pro bono. I'm hoping that with some support we can get a big movement going. I'm seeing really big things for us!
