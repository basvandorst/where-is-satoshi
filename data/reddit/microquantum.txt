CryptocurrencyTalk, Gemini, and Steemit should be on here. However, you can't always mention them all :)

Yes, people are slowly starting to take me seriously. Lots of people think its a bubble when Bitcoin has a lot of technological capabilities they can't comprehend. Watch positive upstreams in 2018 too :)

Definitely investing in BTC would be better for your wallet, and health ;)

Now look at it having already passed $8k just few days ago, a $10k+ rise for BTC is likely imminent.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:50
Can't believe it beat the $10k run in less then a day. Just comes to show how viable Bitcoin, the blockchain and cryptocurrency is

Would be interesting to see if Japan will start getting into large scale mining operations like China was doing

CEOs never should fully speak for the user. The CEO's job is more suited to fulfill the demand and needs of the users. I believe features should be more democratized and utilize a stakes and a DAO. 
If the CEO represents all the users then it truly isn't a decentralized crypto. If a group of executives represent all the views of the users no matter what, then you are running a cryptocurrency like a Oligarchy.

That is because the technology as well as supply &amp; demand improved over time. He did smart investing.

Good job, also look into Ethereum! The Cryptocurrency market is emerging and there are numerous of ways to get involved. I like reading developer SDKs, looking at tools in GitHub, and reading hundreds of whitepapers and books every month to learn as much as I can. Both investing and knowing is really important for early adapters.

Could be a contract manufacturer, large scale partnerships, or they do it themselves. I doubt it is the third option. They may be mining off of GPUs or CPU cores.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:28:04
That is because the massive market support it has, and the fact that it is a valuable asset based on the way it was developed

I feel they may have released the fork a bit too early. Waiting for official announcements on this
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:17:12
I wonder what cryptocurrency can do to disrupt a city like Harlem or even Chicago for that matter
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:52:19
A big difference between 8% and 200%

First with Bitcoin Cash and now we have BTC Gold. Are the creators of the new forks reliable for the cryptocurrency community or is it just a dump compared to what Bitcoin have become?
@_date: 2017-09-30 05:34:52
Yes, but what is even more impressive is that BTC may start having more trading volume then some of the top INC 20 companies. Also the fact that Bitcoin is able to recoup back into a positive correlation so quick from media critics.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:57:04
Ofcourse it has, BTC has increased in its demand due to the fact that the market started becoming aware of its implications. The blockchain as a whole has been effected as well with the rise of private currencies, Ethereum, and altcoins. ICOs may also replace the way Nasdaq is going with IPOs or how stocks are traded in general. Cryptocurrency is where the future seems to be heading, and it is our duty to use it responsibly to bring humanity forward.

Congrats, Bitcoin already went up $5 after that, now trailing at $6,145 and expected positive correlations to come :)
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:25:16
Instead of criticizing cryptocurrencies, they should realize that it is a more proficient form of transactions in this digitized and modern age
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:46:54
Haha, what are your thoughts on BTCGold?
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:34:35
Ofcourse it is, reached a record high yesterday than beat that high today with a past $5.7k trendline. A $6k Bitcoin price is imminent.
