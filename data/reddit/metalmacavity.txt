OK, noob question. How much safer is a paper wallet over keeping them on a flash drive that you store locally or keep on your person?

I was referring more to the statement on the purchase page about receiving the equivalent market value in BTC on such-and-such date; it currently does not clarify whether you are receiving today's market value or the future market value whenever your funds are pulled.

Valid point, but it's not like the coinbase extension is going to put bitcointip out of business. Bitcointip will still be there for ~~cheapos~~ frugal individuals who want to  tip &lt;$2. What's wrong with having more choices to grow the bitcoin market, especially if one choice makes it a little (a lot?) easier for new inductees to make sense of this bitcoin business?
That said there's obviously little reason to use the coinbase extension if you don't already have (or want) a coinbase account. But for you and I and others already invested in coinbase, why would you be concerned with being a shill for a company you already support with your money? Personally I see it less as being a shill for them and more as being a shill for bitcoin; it's all about growing the market, and any little thing that makes it even a little easier for people to give bitcoin a try... well, I just don't see how it's hurting anyone.

What isn't clear is what day's market value they intend to use for the conversion: the day you hit buy, or the day you get your BTC.
Supposedly it's supposed to be the latter, and people like me are getting the former.

Put the name into my preferred J&lt;--&gt;E dictionary and the family name Nakamoto has a whopping 11 different kanji spellings... so yeah, I'd say that's a common one.
Satoshi apparently means guidance or admonition. Sounds a touch like the DPR mindset if he had that in mind.

You MIGHT be able to buy after that; unfortunately Coinbase hits their purchase limit quickly and often so you may have to keep checking back (or use that app I saw someone link; I think I have it saved somewhere) to get your purchase in.
I was able to get my purchase in right after noon PST.

Question for OP: if the recipient of the tip does not wish to sign up for Coinbase (for whatever reason) do they have the option to send their tip to another pre-existing address?
Just trying to play devil's advocate; personally I am a satisfied Coinbase customer and I am enthusiastic about having a new tipping option that is A) **feeless** so the recipient actually gets my whole tip instead of most of it, and B) more streamlined and less intimidating for bitcoin noobs so they can jump into the world of bitcoin feet first with a minimum of fuss. I fail to see how this can possibly be a bad thing for bitcoin adoption in general, but it seems the bitcointip downvote brigade disagrees.
edit: not to mention this extension doesn't also require tampermonkey to be installed compared to the bitcointip extension, and to me less browser bloat is never a bad thing. Yes I know you don't need the extension to use bitcointip.
double edit: FWIW, 2 of the top 3 posts in at the time of this writing are from noobs completely perplexed on how to use it. One of the noobs even says he has an A+ certification and can't make sense of this. But it's easy, right?

Just got my bank account verified and now not only will Coinbase not let me buy today, they're telling me that when I DO buy I'll get the market price on Friday.
edit: just bought my first bitcoin at $233.50.  :)

I actually did look for the bitcointip module in RES previously but I'm under the impression it was removed a while back and never reimplemented. I still don't see it in there.

I've noticed occasionally on reddit a comment seemingly will end up in the completely wrong thread and subreddit than where it was intended. That may be what happened here.

For the most part people don't seem to have problems with Coinbase if the value of BTC RISES during the wait period (though I have seen some reports of them cancelling orders when this occurs and forcing the customer to reorder).
Rather, most of the negative reports are from people who got screwed EXPECTING that Coinbase would allocate BTC for their payment based on the so-called future price point that you describe, and they don't. Indeed, reports seem to indicate that it can go both ways and Coinbase will do whatever works out best for them (and not you) at any given moment.
I invite you to prove me wrong.
edit: you didn't have any trouble reading that, did you?
double edit: from MockingJ's comment below.
*So I would buy at say $50/BTC but by the time the transaction cleared they recalculated my BTC payout to be $80/BTC. So basically, you're screwed if the price goes up. You're screwed if the price goes down. They always give you the worse option.*

I'll admit I watched a fair bit of him around 05-06 when I was into the Truther stuff. He seemed a lot more level-headed back then.
Nowadays he's just painful to watch. That recent appearance on Piers Morgan's show for example. You can disagree with a man's opinion all you want and that's all well and good, but Alex was just a crass, bellowing buffoon, talking over Piers and even childishly mocking Piers's accent toward the end of the interview.
No better way to discredit your own position than to conduct yourself like a pompous ass while the person you're debating is nothing but patient, calm and respectful to you. Alex may have been a decent voice for his cause once, but now he's just an embarrassment.
edit: spelling.

SR tumbled all the incoming BTC and the FBI admitted that the tumbler was effective. I highly doubt linking OP's account to SR is a probable scenario.

This is why I use two-factor authentication and don't worry about it. I'm not terribly concerned that an attacker will hunt me down through my browsing history and steal my cellphone.

Correct, that's exactly what I said, and precisely the results any rational-minded customer would expect from either ticking or not ticking the box.
What you seem to be missing here is that people (myself included) are ticking the box, and getting the result you would expect from NOT ticking the box. I was charged $230 for only 1 BTC even though the value of BTC had dropped substantially in the interim, and I am quite sure I did check the box because I expected the transaction would not be allowed if I didn't (like so many 'I agree to such-and-such TOS to use/receive this service/product').
And just so we're clear here: the money did not leave my account until the same day I received the BTC. Therefore, I expected the BTC to be priced to the value THAT DAY, not 4 days prior.

I was logged in to my coinbase account and it went unbelievably smooth. I just clicked one button and cb did the rest. edit: identical experience buying [The Bitcoin Bundle]( as well. I already own most of those games but at least I can use my BTC on something cheap and it's painless for me to do so.

The comment from westonv above implies that they aren't always doing this. If they charged you more than you agreed to pay I would be demanding a refund. If they refuse I'd start making a stink on reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:47:11
The comments in this and other Coinbase-related threads today have not exactly inspired confidence in their operation, and the buy limits and turnaround time seem to be in place only to cover their asses and potentially screw the customer the more I think about it.
I'm now looking into opening a CapitalOne 360 checking account with no-fee P2P payment to use in conjunction with Bitfloor. Seems like the next best thing for convenience and value.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:53:37
Call me crazy, but wouldn't ticking that box be what allows for variation in amount of BTC received based on the future market value for whatever day the funds get pulled?
If I don't tick it, that should mean I expect to get the exact amount of BTC I ordered. Which I did, and yet I'm quite certain I ticked that box.
Starting to see why people are so dissatisfied with their experiences buying from Coinbase? Any company that makes doing business with them this confusing and has their interface designed such as to make the customer easily screw him or herself clearly has their head lodged firmly up their ass with regard to customer service, or has knowingly and maliciously designed it this way to begin with. If this was an honest and reputable company we were talking about, that option would not even exist at all.

Yeah, I'm really hoping it's based on today's price and not Friday's. Not much we can do but wait and see...

I looked in the support section for information on cancelling a transaction and supposedly there is a cancel button on the transaction page for *only a few minutes* after placing an order. After that it is locked in.
However, I also saw comments from other users saying that even immediately after placing the order they didn't see the cancel button show up.

He just said it would make you a target, not that it would actually facilitate hijacking. I fail to see how an extension would make you any more of a target than visiting bitcoin-related sites (like this one).

There are complaints in the very same thread you are posting in about getting shafted by them when the price was rising.
@_date: 2013-10-22 05:57:28
Sounds pretty good to me, and I'm sure it will improve over time. Unfortunately I haven't been able to get the extension to work yet, though that may be due to using it under Opera Next 18 (Opera 15+ unofficially supports Chrome extensions).
I first tried sending $2 USD and got unknown error; next I tried sending .02 BTC, unknown error again. Temporarily disabling Adblock and Ghostery didn't help either. I'll give it some time and try again after a week or so, especially considering I'm using an unsupported browser to begin with.
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:07:31
Why did OP even have to contact them in the first place to force them to do the right thing?
Maybe because they had no intention of doing so otherwise.

If you just heard about bitcoin for the first time today because somebody sent you a bitcointip through reddit, you do not *have* a bitcoin address.
