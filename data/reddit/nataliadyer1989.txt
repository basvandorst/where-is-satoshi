What is a decentralized exchange? Exchanges in person?
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:24:19
That's fantastic. If they are immediately convertible how does this work with both blockchains?
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:21:10
An article from 2015, really??

The usability would need to drastically improve. For your average user it's not easy to setup cold storage.

It's one of the safest options for purchasing bitcoins with no ID.

The oscillations should hopefully dampen.
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:36:32
Wouldn't that depend on the laws of the country in which you reside?
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:29:16
Fiat is currency who's value is derived from government regulation or law.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:39:49
Why is the last part not true?

Ok, it doesn't reduce your individual chance but the more hashpower is pitted against you, the more likely it is the rest of the network (as a whole) will solve it before you.

You could just use a bitcoin ATM. Fees usually range from 5 to 15% although I've mostly seen them around 5/6%.
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:00:18
So it will continue to oscillate?
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:56:20
How are rewards issued? I always thought it was given to the first miner to solve the block.
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:20:37
I'm in the UK and I just use an ATM. ~6% fees.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:13:09
To think that there is roughly 140 million kg of gold already mined meaning bitcoin is much rarer (per unit - BTC to Au (kg)). (I know bitcoin is divisible to 10E-8, i.e. a satoshi)
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:38:34
Math checks out.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:58:19
One more question, will Litecoin essentially operate exactly like Bitcoin on LN? I'm trying to see the advantage of Litecoin if Bitcoin has LN.
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:48:36
Won't the preference of one chain have a slight damping factor in its favour?

Where does one become a memetic engineer?

TIL shapeshift keeps a record of bitcoin-monero transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:47:55
So Litecoin intends to merge with Bitcoin through the lightning network for smaller, faster but less secure transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:47:16
Ok, yes the time taken on average to solve a block depends on the difficulty but the chance of someone finding it first depends on their hashpower relative to the network's total hashpower. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 06:36:28
The value of gold is not based purely on its intrinsic or 'use case' value. It has properties just like bitcoin that people attribute value to. Platinum is cheaper and rarer than gold and is more useful as a material.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:25:53
Yeah, we could keep going but it certainly puts it into perspective how owning an entire bitcoin is quite significant if bitcoin gets mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:20:19
Ok, thanks. Is finding the same as solving? I am also confused. How is my previous comment not equivalent to the first miner to find the block? (cast the specified number on the die in your example).
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:46:17
This is from 2014 by the way.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:55:05
Could somebody ELI5 why they want to keep inflation up and what effects it has? Also, with what money are they buying these securities? I'm slowly learning so bare with me.

Why is the ethereum classic volume so high?
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:53:25
I think the stickied price thread helped a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:54:28
Haha, I love it.
@_date: 2017-08-20 13:51:16
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:46:36
The more hashpower on the chain, the lower your percentage of all hashpower on the chain, therefore you are less likely to be rewarded.

Tails properly connects to tor?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:37:14
Do you have a link to the transaction?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:15:43
Yeah and look at the price for 1kg of gold.
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:22:50
Exactly.
