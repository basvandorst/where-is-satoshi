Yea too late for Bitcoin mate. Buy something that's like 1 or 5 cents, and then wait for it to hit $10000!

Fix your website first. Several typos, outdated fonts- does not give the appearance of legitimacy. You're competing in a very crowded and growing space. The descriptions sure make it look like a scam- very copy-paste and generic. 
Worst of all- it sends the OTP to a different number than what I input. Laughable.
You respond to a different poster that "government hasn't announced that Bitcoin is illegal." The poster is not commenting on the legitimacy of Bitcoin. The comment is on the legitimacy of your site. And I agree with the poster.
The best I can say, assuming complete sincerity on your part and no intent to scam, is that you have announced this site here on Reddit way too prematurely. You still have lorem ipsum text on your site and half the links don't work. Have you even looked at some of the other recently launched exchanges?

You have a link for "create account." It asks for phone number. It sends OTP to a number different than what is input.

If you're Satoshi can you please airdrop your own stash to all of humanity :P

Your public key is your address. That's what you'll share with people when you want to receive, like you share your email address.

I do think Ethereum governance is far more centralised than it should be, and am personally not a fan of Vitalik Buterin. But that's only my opinion. Others may tell us about how Bitcoin mining is highly centralised and this compromises its governance somewhat. 
But overall, I believe the development of Bitcoin is far more decentralised than that of any other token. It also helps that Satoshi Nakamoto is an unknown and no longer a factor in Bitcoin development. There is no foundation or organisation in charge. This, to me, puts Bitcoin above all else. I see your username, and assuming you're Indian and know Hindi, my view is summarised such- एक ही बिट्कौईन, बाकी सब शिट्कौईन

I'll do my best to answer...
Q1: I don't understand this question. What does it mean for the blockchain to be based on something? I think between the 2 options you cite, is more accurate to say that Bitcoin's blockchain is based on number of coins in circulation. I say this because the blockchain size increases by adding blocks, and when a block is added Bitcoins are released as reward for the miner who solved the cryptographic puzzle and added the block.
Q2: You receive Bitcoin for mining, not just by having coin. 
Q3: Not yet, but since smart contracts can (will?) eventually be written on the Bitcoin blockchain, this might indeed happen.
Q4: I don't know if I can say that Bitcoin is "just" money. I'd argue that none of us really know yet what Bitcoin is and what it can be. But yes, it was originally conceived as a means of P2P electronic cash. Other coins have specific purposes because not all imaginable and unimaginable purposes have already been coded into Bitcoin, and not all will be either. Some, like smart contracts, might be. Others, like privacy, might not. So for every specialised need or utility, one could create a different token designed just for that purpose.
Q4.2: This is contentious. I think the price movements certainly show that Bitcoin is still the king by far. When Bitcoin drops, altcoins drop even more. Further, Bitcoin is still the rallying flag for new entrants to cryptosphere, so in that sense it is again essential. But time will tell whether this stays true forever.

I'm just guessing here- maybe because the fees is too low? Latest block I think the average fees was over 100 sats/B.

Dude what are you smoking? Look at your image. The text section for  "Email" says "Type full name here"
The text section for "Password" says "Type email here"
I'm not going to argue with you that this site is either a scam, entirely prematurely shared, or basically just bollocks.

I like the theory where Satoshi Nakamoto translates as Central Intelligence. And sha256 is anyway NSA developed. So BTC is the deep state's attempt to establish a global, transparent, traceable currency. Takes us one step closer to global empire. Ruled, as another poster has already pointed out, by the Rothschilds.
Edit: on another note, kinda feels all good and nicely wrapped up to think that our boi Elon Musk might be Satoshi.

No disagreement there.

There's no substitute for the original Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi.

I think we might see a change if more alts had direct USD pairs and one didn't have to trade BTC or ETH first to acquire them.

I think it helps to think in terms of "server" decentralisation vs. "political decentralisation." 
Companies and nations might create their own tokens, but those will, by definition, not be politically decentralised. In that sense, no company or nation can create a blockchain- they can only create a new database which they own and manage.
The reason for saying that Bitcoin and blockchain cannot be separate is because if we are to maintain political decentralisation, the ledger/database has to be maintained by several independent nodes. But why would people run nodes if there is no incentive? The native token becomes the incentive. Enter Bitcoin.
For other cryptocurrencies, yes, they can and do develop their own blockchains with native tokens, not Bitcoin. Here we run into comparisons of these cryptocurrencies having CEOs and founders on one hand, and Bitcoin with no central figure any longer on the other hand.

In my view, all one needed to know was that Bcash was supported by a dude who backed Mt. Gox, a dude who was anyway planning to launch an altcoin called metronome, and a dude who had the audacity to claim that he was Satoshi himself. Reddit notwithstanding.

3k is a good number, yes. But I feel 3002 is a beautiful number. You should have invested 3002 instead of 3000

It at least makes more sense for them to understand cryptography and mathematics than fiat currencies I guess...

True. Szabo's been getting quite caustic on Twitter recently. On the whole I do think I get his viewpoint, but he's (only) starting to look to this scene what an ageing, senile Richard Dawkins is to atheism.

Yet another reason to not reuse BTC addresses, especially ones you send from to darker corners of the net. Your public address is bound to eventually get linked to your actual identity if you're not careful, especially if you're a freelancer who also takes donations/payments to that address.
