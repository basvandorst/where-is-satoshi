Upvoted too
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:22:34
Exactly that is what i mean.i know BTC cant be stopped but if it gets dumped to 0 it will be years to recover
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:42:20
While people claim 0.2 id say u neeed at least 20.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:11:02
Imo exchanges only Have to care of your fundusz not of what u trade.espmin bitcoin world there should be nobody hwo can Deicide whats traded and whats not
@_date: 2015-01-18 14:37:09
Id f you are desperate then maybe you should quit
