I have an idea.  Send me bitcoins and I'll send 99% of different outputs back to you with zero confirmations of your original transaction.  I'll just check a site like blockchain and look for double spends, and if there aren't any after the 30 seconds it takes me to verify the numbers and copy-paste the wallet address, I'll send the same amount back to you, minus 1%.
I'm telling you this right now.  What do you do?  How do you take advantage of this?  Do you honestly think you can make a profit?  I bet not.

Hey guse, I've unlocked the sekrit of why bitcoin is "never going to be a real currency" with this extremely insightful reasoned argument!
"oh really?  what is that?"
The answer is that people just don't care about it.
"Wait, wat?  what's your evidence?"
 They just don't.
"Why should we listen to you?"
Well I entered bitcoin at the worst possible time and lost money, but that clearly has nothing to do with my highly informed opinion.  I'll mention that wealth management is hard so I seem legit, and also say some nice things about bitcoin while I make the incredibly deep observation that people are not rational, but should try to be.

It doesn't have to reissue the transaction, only say "oops, it isn't on the blockchain anymore", and so cancel it and credit the balance back to the user (despite them *actually* receiving the coins).  This is the most likely way it happened (if it wasn't an inside job).  It is still certainly due to stupid implementation fail.

I agree, the best guidance is to carry on your phone whatever you are comfortable carrying in your wallet.  If you intend to spend 10BTC, you can put 10BTC in your phone *for a few hours*, but generally you should avoid it, and be extra weary while you are carying so much "cash".

I would get 2 TREZORs, put 50 BTC in each, get 2 safety deposit boxes, put seed A and trezor B in the first box and seed B and trezor A in the second box.  In order to lose the coins you'd literally need to have two banks burn down.
If your goal is longevity, get the words of the seed inscribed on a piece of metal.
If your goal is security from the government, choose a bank in a location where banking secrecy is respected and the safety deposit boxes can never be raided.
If your goal is accessibility keep one trezor on your person with the amount of bitcoin you want to be accessible and the rest in the other one kept in a safety deposit box with the two seeds which you can access as a cold wallet (even though both are technically cold).
If your goal is plausible deniability configure a passphrase with the trezor and pick two passwords and put a small amount of BTC in the "fake" password (boom, it's now $5 wrench attack proof!)

How is that any better?  It could let you input the die rolls then ignore them, or it could use the entropy unsafely and still be vulnerable.  This is the classic problem with hardware wallets, even if their design and firmware are open-source, you still have to trust they don't have any back doors.  Even if you entered the entire seed, RNG is still used to generate nonces for signatures and insecure RNG can lead to leaking private keys.
Hardware wallets are an advance because they are difficult to attack with malware, and it is generally easier to trust the manufacturer than some web wallet - but trust is still needed unless you built it yourself (or compiled the firmware from source then installed it on a general hardware device yourself like a raspberry pi or whatever).  Even then you trust RPIs aren't backdoored (which is pretty unlikely).
TL;DR: security is crazy yo.

This point is completely wrong.  If it is too slow for retail transactions, your retailers are using it wrong.  Give it time though.  Remember when you used to have to put a credit card into that big "cha-chunk" machine that took an imprint of it?  Have you ever seen a retailer accept a check, examining ID, writing the little T-bar thing and the four pieces of data (including your drivers license number) onto the check, BY HAND?  Writing a check used to take 10 minutes for an unpracticed cashier and 5 minutes even for the fastest, best trained one.
Bitcoin can be near-instant.  You don't need to wait for a confirmation, you just need to wait for the network to see the transaction.  Look at the recent advances in NFC communication (sending the transaction directly to the retailer so they have it) and "transaction propogation" where when 90% of the bitcoin network has seen the transaction, even though it isn't in a block, it would be *very* difficult to double-spend it.  Many solutions are in the works, but even today, without any of these, accepting 0-confirmations is perfectly safe and acceptable (and would result in less-loss-than-credit-card-chargebacks) for almost every retailer that would use it.
Your other points are interesting, but this one is complete FUD.

Sure, I'm just saying I don't think it is "clear" that it was an inside job.  mtgox, bitstamp, and btc-e all had broken implementations with the same vulnerability, right?  It's easy to imagine the SR2 admins might have missed a 1-day window while this attack occurred.  If they had 5BTC to apply to the attack, had 50% success rate with malleability, and required 6 confirms after deposit before they could withdrawl, then:
each attack would take 6 confirms =&gt; ~50 minutes, each success would double the BTC available to attack with, 50% of the attacks would succeed.  (5BTC*(2**X)) = 4400, X =~ 10.  So it'd take 10 successful attacks, so 20 attacks on average, that's about 16 hours, and 75% of the BTC wouldn't be missing until the last 3 hours...

If you go to an impartial source, like blockchain.info, and see the transaction, and see that it isn't (at that time double spent), you can be 99.99% sure it will go through.  Without an insane amount of computing power, it would be very difficult to double spend a transaction that blockchain.info sees and does not yet see a "double spend" of.  Search this subreddit for mention of "transaction confidence", which is a measure of how much of the network has seen the original transaction (and thus would reject an attempted double spend).
If the transaction doesn't go through for any reason other than double spend, you can just retransmit it (it is public).  If the user is going to try to double spend it, they have to find a node on the network that hasn't seen it yet, and transmit it to that node, then the part of the network that gets the "wrong" transaction would have to get "lucky" and mint the next block.
Because blockchain.info talks to many nodes on the network, the probability of a double spend which blockchain.info doesn't see after 30 seconds is very very very close to zero.
Long story short, confirmations are relevant for confidence *after the first confirmation*, but before the first confirmation, every second that passes that a site like blockchain.info doesn't "see" a double spend increases your confidence too.
EDIT: If I saw a user transmit a transaction from coinbase or similar service, or if I saw a user transmit a transaction using the android wallet app and actually watched them do it, I would accept a zero-conf transaction of up to $10,000 probably.  A successful double-spend of $10,000 would crash bitcoin, nobody who isn't retarded would do that.  If it was a "stranger over the internet" I would accept instant zero-conf transactions of up to $100 and 30-second-delay transactions of up to $1000 probably, but it is hard to imagine an online usecase where the user can't just wait 5 minutes or something for an even higher confidence level.

Can someone answer me why this isn't a feasible explanation?
1. User deposits X BTC
2. User withdrawls X BTC
3. the withdrawl transaction is resent with a different TX ID
4. with some success rate Y, the "wrong one will be put into a block
5. If  "succeeds", SR2 sees the transaction never happened because it was implemented poorly.  If  "fails", withdrawler has their coins, and redeposits
6. go to 2.
In this way, without risking any BTC, an attacker could empty out the entire hot wallet, no?

If you accept the header and start mining right away, before validating the block, then you are susceptible to a DDOS attack by sending seemingly valid headers but whose proof of work is incorrect (and cannot be validated until the entire block is received).
If you do not begin mining until you validate the block, then you must receive the entire block.
If I understand Gavin's suggestion correctly of using a "bloom filter diff" strategy, it lets you get the full block faster by only needing the header, then asking for only the additional transactions you require via a bloom filter (which is O(1) regardless of block size).
So the time to receive a header (and know which is first) is O(1), the time to start mining is O(n/m) where N is the size and M is the size of transactions already in your mempool, and the miner can know the block is verified immediately without wasting any effort on maliciously crafted DDOS attacks.
Or - do you have a solution for how to prevent bad blocks if you "accept" after getting just the header, and only reject after you receive the entire block and discover the proof of work is faulty? (i.e. someone could send a header + max block size of random data repeatedly to cause your node to mine against an invalid chain repeatedly)
EDIT: jgarzik hinted at this in the github thread when he said: "Bitcoin is a trustless system. You don't mine on blocks unless you have proven through validation that you trust them. Your distinction is without difference."  I think what would nail the point home more clearly, however, is my suggestion of the DDOS problem this creates - it is a concrete example of WHY you must not pass it on before verification.

This isn't very "insidery" at all, just random speculation.  I had hoped to hear something more specific.  If you want some speculation which is actually useful, how about this:
The "hack" was almost certainly an inside job and "better auditing" and "industry standard best practices" probably wouldn't have stopped it.  Based upon the comment that the site would be back up "after moving servers to a more secure location", I theorize (and this is just a theory, mind you, but a likely one IMO) that the BTC was stolen by someone with physical access to the servers.  They might have worked for bitstamp or they might have worked for the datacenter where bitstamp held their servers.  This is probably just like the linode breach slush experienced.  It also explains why they were able to grab the hot wallets but not the cold storage (which is why cold storage is great).
Even if the servers were secured with high-end crypto, locked in their racks, hand all external ports disabled except for network... physical access is the end of the road as whitehats and researchers have shown:
A particularly interesting one here:
A standard cell phone microphone, set a few feet away from the machine, with a few hours of recording, can collect enough data to reveal a private key.  Obviously, in the wild this would be way harder to pull off, but a determined attacker had 19,000 reasons to try in this instance.

good point about miners trying to game it.  I also agree timestamps are probably not reliable, and multiplying/creating BTC is unacceptable.
So we have block B and C both of which are children of block A.
* Block B awards 25.15 BTC to address 1Baddr...
* Block C awards 25.13 BTC to address 1Caddr...
The union of fees from B and C is 0.18, let's say, so the total block reward would have been 25.18.  So when we generate block D which merges block B and C, we should calculate fair fees and adjust the balance of 1Baddr and 1Caddr accordingly, and we can weight their fees by the actual work they did like so:
    B's fair share is (25/2) + (0.15 / (0.15 + 0.13) * 0.18) = 12.5 + 0.08357143
    C's fair share is (25/2) + (0.13 / (0.15 + 0.13) * 0.18) = 12.5 + 0.09642857
So I propose that a merge block include a "merge transaction" which spends both of the outputs above and creates the outputs I proposed ("destroying" 1 block reward that never should have existed and instead splitting the reward and tx fees).  Finally, the merge block itself can also include transactions and should earn a block reward plus new tx fees (not taking anything from the previous block).
This same process could be applied to more than 2 chains, or chains whose most recent common ancestor is more than 1 block behind (with some added complexity, but the same idea).
* no additional BTC is created - the reward is shared in proportion to the work done including transaction fees
* No more orphaned blocks
* miners won't be able to game the system, in fact the incentives will be to still try to avoid forking because then you have to share the reward, so people will still try to lower latencies
* double spend attempts will guarantee the block can never be merged, so in case there isn't already enough reasons not to bother, here is one more
* this might make it easier to "repair" the network in the case of another unintentional fork (like the max block limit thing), as instead of throwing away transactions, devs could make a patch which recognizes both chains and merges them (again, as long as there are no double spends).
* producing and verifying a merge block adds code complexity
* spending block rewards will prevent merges because the reward can't be adjusted.  Theoretically, miners will prefer not to opt out of merging and risk orphans, so they will simply volunteer not to spend the output for a few blocks.  It won't be necessary to enforce non-spending in code, however, since the impact is just that you can't merge after doing so.
* Current tools for analyzing and visualizing the block chain will need to be updated
* the math above could involve fractional results and have to figure out a fair way to do rounding to the nearest satoshi
Am I missing anything?
EDIT: an alternative is to keep both 25BTC rewards and just adjust the TX fees.  The proof-of-work is still valid, it's kinda unfair to take away half the reward just because two blocks were found closer together than the propagation latency between these two nodes... the only downside of that is the incentive to keep latencies down is lessened.  Are there implications for centralization that would be improved by not making latency such a big thing though?

I wish I could honestly say "I've never seen a therad with so many people that know so little about what they are talking about", but I'd be lying.  But it's close - so that's bad and you should all feel bad.
Double spend attacks are basically impractical.  To actually pull of a double spend attack requires EITHER a lot of hashing power OR a large number of nodes on the network (so you can broadcast two conflicting tx to two parts of the network and hope the "wrong" one wins).
If you look at the last year, and take the number of successful intentional double-spends executed (I believe 0 or 1) divided by the total number of bitcoin transactions, compared to the number of fraudulent credit card transactions in the last year divided by the number of credit card transactions in the last year, you would find bitcoin fraud is much less likely and the amount of the fraud is much lower [Citation Needed].
Stop spreading misinformation about double spends, the only people likely to successfully execute one could make MORE money by just hashing instead, so the financial incentives are misaligned.

I hoped that workload existed that were not I/O bound.  You are right that if that is the case, the market for this is extremely limited.  In that case, of course, the CPU cycles aren't being "Wasted" becasue there is no demand for them outside the bitcoin network, so people can stop "bitching and moaning".
Still, it'd be really nice if for the few non-I/O-bound workloads out there, a platform existed.  Also, as gigabit internet service rolls out to more and more areas, I/O could be less of a concern.
An example workload that people could work on *today* is password cracking.  Let's say I lost the password to my bitcoin wallet, but I remember how long it was, and a few other characteristics of it.  I could take a subset of the wallet (to prevent the "cracker" from spending it) and have the whole network try to brute force it, and any time someone found a decryption which yielded a valid header they could send it to me.
People could also brute-force leaked password databases (some "good guy" and some "bad buy" reasons to do this), or produce huge rainbow tables or whatever.
Companies might value their algorithms, but researchers in academia are going to report their findings anyways, so they don't need to guard their algos that meticulously.

If I had to wager which was more likely, someone going to the effort of creating gold with fusion, or 51% of the miners deciding to change the rules for awarding bitcoin, I'd wager the latter was more likely.
That said, neither is likely to happen in a way which destroys or even significantly harms the value of the resource, because then what would be the point? If bitcoin becomes worth $10,000 a bitcoin some day, and the miners agree to switch from halving rewards to just constant, or extend the period during which rewards are being generated, the value of bitcoin could still increase faster than it is added to the market (and the players would want that).
As for events that would actually harm the value of the mineral, A golden meteor could fall from the sky, but I wouldn't bet on it.  Likewise, sha1 or ecc could be broken suddenly, tomorrow, before the bitcoin client could adapt, but I wouldn't bet on it.  Nonetheless, in this case also, I think I know which of these is more likely.

I created an account to poke around.  If you want people to plan with real bitcoins, you should provide proof of adequate randomness. There have been randomness exploits in other poker engines (including maven's).  The best bet is to release the source for your PRNG (or entire engine) or get an independent audit.
Here are the things I, as a poker player, would like to see:
1. Details about the PRNG and/or public statistics of card distributions to help ensure proper randomness
2. What measures are taken against collusion?  For now, while on test net, you suggest I play against myself on the same table to test it out.  Will you prevent people from the same IP from playing on the same table in the future?  Will you detect collusion in other ways?
These are the two most important points for a fair game, and people won't play unless they trust (at least somewhat) that it is fair.  sealswithclubs has done this.

The downside is, verifying transactions (that remint BTC from zerocoins) are 50 times slower and take up much more space on the block chain.

22 characters, single round of sha256, modern hardware (not even ASICs) can do 10,000 per second, a-zA-Z0-9 = 62^22 =&gt; a search space of 2707803647802660400290261537185326956544, or 2.71x10^39 entries, which is 7.52x10^31 hours of compute time.  If your password contained any dictionary words in it, however, it could have been much much shorter. Here's the thing - all addresses on the entire block chain can be checked in O(1) time, so even if your password is fairly long, someone could have been scanning and gotten lucky and guessed it (again, especially if it had a dictionary word and they were using a brute force library that includes dictionary attacks).

&lt;$100 is a conservative estimate.  Given that digital cameras under 4MP can be as little as $20, and the ipod shuffle starts at $50 (and no double has a huge markup), I think all the components could be had for under $50, and a nice money clip or leather wallet can easily be 50-100$.

For the safest type of exchange:
1. A party responds to an ad, the two parties exchange messages and agree on a meeting time and place which is public.
2. Seller of BTC sends the BTC to a special address localbitcoins.com generates, or pays out of their localbitcoins wallet.  The site then informs both parties that the transaction is "funded", which means that localbitcoins.com itself asserts that the bitcoins are there and you aren't about to get screwed.
3. The parties meet, the buyer shows the cash, maybe places it on the table or counts it in front of the seller.  Once the seller is satisfied, the seller releases the funds (via a text message, mobile web site, etc).  If the buyer does not have a way to verify the transaction (say a smart phone), the seller can also give a special code the buyer was told earlier but which localbitcions only tells to the seller after releasing the funds.
4. At this point, the funds are instantly released to the buyer's localbitcions wallet.  The seller collects the cash and both parties leave.
The only way this can go wrong is if the buyer shows the cash, waits for the release, then tries to grab it off the table, or jump you with physical violence or something.  I've NEVER heard of this actually happening, and if you pick a properly public place, it should be very unlikely.

You can already have this now.  Just keep most of your bitcoins in a paper wallet stored in a safe deposit box, and keep 2-3 in a wallet on your phone (or in coinbase or whatever).  If you only ever keep the same amount of value in your phone bitcoin wallet that you would keep in your regular wallet, losing your wallet is just like losing your phone.  And if the private key to your savings is in a safe deposit box, it's pretty damn safe - do you think someone is going to hold a gun to your head, drag you to your bank, tell you to go into the bank and retrieve it while they wait in the car?  Probably not.
you can even add a third level.  50-200$ in your phone, maybe 500-1000$ in a paper wallet stored at home, and the remainder of your savings in a safe deposit box (or whatever different levels you are comfortable with).  You have infinitely greater flexibility with bitcoin.  The nLockTime suggestions above are great technical solutions, but this is by and large a social problem, not a technology problem.

Poster missed the most important tip - the embedded strip in the bills.  Did these fake bills have a strip?  I'd be very suprised if they did...
20's have a strip on the left side (when looking at the portrait side) about 1/3 of an inch in which, when held up to the light, reads "USA TWENTY USA TWENTY ..."
100's have a strip on the left side (when looking at the portrait side) about 1 and 1/3 of an inch in which, when helpd up to the light, reads "USA 100 USA 100 ..."
I always pick a few random bills and look for these strips, they are the easiest things to identify which are hard to counterfeit, and require no special equipment (pen, etc).
Not that carrying a pen is a bad idea either.... Maybe I'll start that...
More details here: 
EDIT: 1s do not have the strip.  very old 20s and 50s and 100s don't have the strip but 100's have had it for the longest time, and any bill which has the newer look should have a strip.
EDIT2: Dear god, poster says in other comments they had a strip that looked reasonable enough to fool him... uh oh...

Sells getting canceled are not about the network not picking them up - they are about coinbase trying to detect fraud automatically (which is impossible to do without false positives and false negatives) and choosing to reverse your transaction.  If this happens to you, you should contact their support team.  My understanding is, once you talk to them in person, and they trust you are not fraud, they can flag your account so it does not happen again.  Also, it'd be really lame if they didn't give you the original price you booked, since it was their fault they canceled your tx.  I would tell them I expect that or it's off to reddit. =/

That is an excellent question.  As others have suggested, you can ask for a signed message but anyone else could forge the signed message who has also compromised the private key.  You could ask them some additional questions just to try to detect bullshit, like why they chose that passphrase, etc.
You could get into an interactive chat with them, then ask them "what device and wallet did you use to send 1.2BTC to address XYZ".  Then, you can whois the IP address to see if it matches their story.  If they say they used blockchain.info, but the transaction was broadcasted from coinbase-owned IP, that'd be weird, right?
Again, this info is also public, but by asking in real-time it would be really hard for an unprepared hacker to provide the right answers without raising red flags...

if the features of the sha256 hash are what we think they are, then yes.  Finding a collision in any uniformly distributed hash function is a poisson random variable, hence memoryless, hence the probability of finding it is unrelated to how many you have found in the past or will find in the future.  For more details, go take 3 years of engineering probability and statistics and get a better grade than a "D-", which is what I got =(

there was a transaction in there with 1BTC fee and ~0.007 returned to the sending address. Hard to see how that could have been intentional. if ~3000 tx is the max, and everyone pays about 0.0005 fees, the highest normal fees you expect to see are 1.5BTC.  we only see more because for complex transactions people sometimes pay 0.001 or more, or to ensure a large tx happens quickly, and of course, because of mistakes.

ROI of 6 months to 1 year is generally considered "good", but it depends greatly on how much hashing power joins the network.  Use this calculator to get a sense for it: 
But note - a huge amount of hashing power is joining the network right now, and many people suspect a difficulty of 100M - 150M by the end of the year is reasonable (that is, 10-15x current diff).   Also consider this unofficial (voluntary) listing of butterfly labs preorders which counts at least 320 TH/s just in the self-reported stats expected to be delivered in the next few months: 
Add to that ASICMiner continuing to both add hardware to their pool and sell hardware, as well as sell loose chips - BFL's announcement they will sell loose chips, and other up-and-coming ASIC devices (of various scam-probabilities), and a 10-15x diff increase seems like lowballing it.  I wouldn't bet against 30 or 50x even.  Multiply the diff by 50 and see how long it takes to break even =(
@_date: 2013-06-04 04:22:10
 As of this writing, next difficulty is in 297 blocks and predicted to be 14.98M (was saying 14.5 earlier today).  It will vary a little bit depending upon how quickly the network grows, but given its current size/speed now, it is totallty reasonable to guess the next diff will be over 14.5M

The coinbase website actually has a paper wallet option, so you can print it out.  This is probably fine.  Some people (with tens or hundreds of BTC) are security conscious and prefer to generate their own paper wallets on an airgapped machine (which you can do using javascript from the website bitaddress.org, for example).
edit: think about your various long-term storage options and choose something best for you.  IMHO, for most people, exporting a wallet file, encrypting with simple pgp, and uploading to google drive or equivalent, is the safest way to ensure nobody can steal *and* you won't lose it.  A piece of paper can be lost in a fire, or a dorm room move, pretty easily.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:33:25
yeah, seems likely then that the site logs / scam was how it happened then. Note that, because people can check all the addresses that have ever been used for almost the same cost as they can check just one address, it has very little to do with how many bitcoins are stored in it though.  If the address was compromised when it was created, you had a very patient crook, he waited until you had made several deposits before making his move.
@_date: 2013-08-10 16:09:28
unclear, and it depends upon HOW it is broken, but it would likely be bad.  People would lose trust in bitcoin and it would become like play money.  If litecoin wasn't impacted, many might switch to it, but the idea of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies as a whole would take a bit hit in public opinion, regardless.
Examples of how it could be broken include:
1. collision attacks - it could be possible to find an exploit speeding up the brute force search for private keys against all keys in the blockchain that contains coins.  This makes it possible to spend other people's bitcoins.
2. preimage attacks[1], on the other hand, mean producing a collision against a specific hash, and could be used to fake transactions, signatures, or mess with the blockchain (you could craft a fake block chain that is longer than the real one, tricking clients into accepting it).
[1] 
EDIT: I meant sha256, not sha1.  To be clear here, if sha1 or sha256 are broken, it has highly negative consequences for a LOT of the software and encryption we rely on worldwide.  It is not unreasonable to presume/hope this will not happen suddenly.

All my passwords are based upon a phrase.  Like "Tacos are my favorite food" becomes "Tac0s!RMIfav0riteFOOD". despite containing dictionary words,this is a fairly secure password.  If possible, I include at least one non-dictionary word (here, are my =&gt; RMI, but sometimes I get more creative in other ways too).  I use something a bit longer for banks or bitcoins.
The other thing is, most of the longer passwords (like for work) I type several times a day.  After about a week I don't even need to think about the phrase of origin, I just feel it in my fingers.  If I ever forget, though, the phrase helps me out.

Look at the Trezor.  Dedicated hardware devices could be made, the "iphones of bitcoin tx", which can receive and send bitcoins safely and be usable by anyone who can press the "send" button.
Imagine you produce a device which has an ipod-mini-sized screen, a cheap camera, and wifi.  it uses hierarchical wallets and the compay that sells it keeps your seed safe for you.  It requires a PIN before it will send any BTC out.  If you report it lost/stolen the company immediately generates a new seed and moves all your bitcoin over to it.  The device costs under 100$.
This is all possible, and with this device, *anyone* could use bitcoin.  It can display and scan QR codes, sign transactions, requires only trusting a company (which you already do trust to have written safe firmware, and which most joe rednecks are glad to do), and has protections against theft and loss.  This would be the device that brings bitcoin to the masses.  Trezor + a smart phone could do all of this right now, so it's just a matter of making a single, compact, easy-to-use device.

If we try to reduce the penalty of forks by having them "count" towards longest chain, why not "unfork" forks when possible?
Say two blocks are discovered at close to the same time, and you have A -&gt; B and A -&gt; C, and B and C have some overlap of transactions but some non-overlapping transactions as well.
As long as no transactions in B and C are conflicting (no attempted double spends), then a node could mine on "both" of them, by claiming it has both B AND C as it's parent.  If a block is found with B *and* C as its parent, then things can proceed normally, and both B and C can receive the reward (perhaps the block which has both of them as a parent can resolve who gets the tx fees and block reward by splitting it between the two addresses, evenly or proportional to the number of transactions, etc).
In this way, people don't "lose out" when things fork... Thoughts?

Creating prior art is not bad, but it only helps you out in court, when for most companies, it is too late (because patent litigation is super expensive).
If you really want to protect against patent bullshit, you have to play the system, not ignore it.  This means creating a (probably non-profit) organization to hold patents to use for defense, which you then license freely to anyone, but will use to defend against / attack anyone who themselves uses patents aggressively.
The problem is all the language I've used above is vague and it is very difficult to establish an organization such as I propose that is legally bound to act as I have described - by and large, you have to trust them to act in good faith and not become a patent troll themselves.

I would probably wait for BFL to start shipping 100+ orders a week, and once they reach that (and people report receiving 30/60GHPS singles) would be a good time to order one (by then the lead time should be predictable and you will know what you are buying).  In the meantime, look to see if ASICMiner lowers their prices, if they get close to 1 or 2BTC/GH and ships immediately, that might be worth investign in (BFL @ current prices are 0.75BTC/GHPS and have better power performance, but with a large lead time)

So you do what Amazon Mechanical Turk does.  You ask two different miners to solve each problem and verify the result.  The more important it is that your result is correct, the more miners you ask.  For 3x the cost, you can confirm that 3 separate miners with different IP addresses came up with the same answer, and if just one of them is wrong, you ask for 2 more.  The cost is linear for exponentially higher confidence.

that's a good point - and if you end up with a 2+ deep fork, it gets even worse!
Imagine You have A -&gt; B -&gt; C and A -&gt; D -&gt; E
You could have T1 in B and E, but T2 in C and D
So what you really have to do is sum up all the transaction fees in *each fork*, weight them by the "work done" by each fork, then again by the "work done" by each block (because B and C will have different addresses, AND D and E may have different addresses).
I have no doubt it can be done, the question is, I think, is the code complexity and block chain complexity worth reducing orphans (I think...just to reduce orphans, it might be worth it, but if it also lets us increase the block frequency to get transactions in a block faster, then it is even more valuable).
EDIT: I think spending TX fees is not a big problem - either they are spent, a valid merge is not possible, and one of the forks "wins", or they are not spent and a merge is possible still. This will encourage people to not spend newly minted coins for a couple of blocks because merges are a benefit (if you prevent merges, you increase risk of orphan) and that alone should be adequate.

This is all on the bitcoin wiki - but suffice to say, the hash of the block INCLUDES the transactions in its input.  So first you generate a set of transactions, then you try to make a block and look at its hash.  IF it doesn't meet the diff, you increment a counter in the block and try again.  You keep trying until you discover a block.  So creating valid blocks requires lots of hashing power - but verifying a block is valid takes almost no power.
This explanation assumes you understand what a hash is.  If not, go read wikipedia for sha1 or something.

I have had this happen. Modern banking shit is just slooooow.  This is how ACH works.  They send it to their bank right away...Who then batch processes ACH (at a particular time).

Wait ANOTHER 24 hours, and then it *might* post to your account, which depending on your bank might still take another 24 hours to show up.
