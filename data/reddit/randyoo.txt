I was thinking the exact same thing!

In my case, it didn't cost anything extra, anyway. As the blockchain grows, and transactions/bandwidth, then maybe there will need to be an incentive... For the moment, I'm more than happy to share my spare capacity for free!

I didn't realize there were alternatives--thanks, I'll look into it!

Seems like a lot could be done from the real Blockchain's end... You could submit some (obviously false) credentials on the scam site, and monitor your server to see where they're submitted from. Then block that IP address. If they are coming from more than one IP, then it should still be a pretty simple matter of writing a script to automate collecting of IP addresses the attacks are coming from, then banning them.

Yep, I'm *desperate* for fractions of dollars! Please, *please* give me a few pennies... &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
Honestly, I hadn't seen a similar post in a long time, and thought it might be a nice inspiration for others who might find themselves in a similar situation. And I won't lie, I'm a little proud, too.

How about 1299 bits? @_date: 2014-08-17 13:21:23
This is the airline that got caught not carrying enough fuel on-board to divert to alternate airports without having to declare an in-flight emergency.
...and that takes advantage of its leverage over its customers to extract extra fees from them, unless they want to miss their flight.
...and has the most rude and poor customer service in the industry.
Whether or not they accept bitcoin, I won't be flying with them again, at any (supposed) price point.
I don't have such strong sentiments about many companies. They can, indeed, go copulate with themselves.

Thanks for the suggestion!
I'm actually kicking myself to this day, because when Bitcoin *first* came out (and I mean publication of the whitepaper), I read about it, found it interesting. I gave very serious consideration to mining, but didn't get into it, since all of my machines were already busy doing "charitable" work (WCG), and I didn't want to sacrifice that for pennies of internet tokens. &lt;shakes head&gt;
In hindsight, I could have pretty easily made a fortune, accomplished a lot more with monetary charitable contributions, and still retired early. Hindsight's 20/20, though, as they say!

I had a different, but similar experience. Arrived at the check-in desk only a few minutes before the cut-off, but they had already closed it. I made it to the customer service window STILL with over a minute before the cut-off, but they refused to check me, claiming it was too late.
They did offer to put us on the next flight, for a penalty of about 10 times what we had paid for our initial tickets!
Instead of giving them more money, we simply cancelled our trip, and I've vowed to never deal with those scumbags again.
Like you, I'm 100% convinced it's an intentional part of their strategy to maximize profits by forcing people to re-book a later flight at a steep penalty.
I'm still in awe of how many people defend and are even fans of an business that is so shady. Do you really want to put your life in the hands of people with those kind of ethics?

But Circle says I need a bank account from the USA!
