Correct, it's not change. I'm aware how change works. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:59:29
np. It was not. It is an address generated in blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:43:26
I guess that would be the employees problem then, to tell the business-owner where the bitcoins went for all the things he sold.

The QR code is static and the address is correct. And it was correctly sent to my address 1CMMB, but then mysteriously transferred from 1CMMB to 1J6zr 10 sec later.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:45:41
No it's an old address generated in blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:12:02
Yea i know. If i type 0.01 it will ask if I want to sent 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:02:36
I have the same logic. Malicious intent or not though, I still can't access the address. I contacted the developer and hope for the best.

Love you to the Moon and back, and then to Mars.

Yes, 1CMMBY and 1VEQi are both addresses in my blockchain.info wallet. 
Somehow the 0.9 btc i sent to 1CMMBY from my friends wallet was 10 sec later transferred to 1J6zr, which is an unfamiliar address.

I had the same thought, so I changed the language, country etc to english which uses . instead of the Danish ,
Same result, it's really a weird bug. However it's not my biggest worry atm ^^
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:44:48
Yes, it was a significant balance. I have no idea what happened and I gave up finding out. I think my best odds are that whoever owns the address will see the public note I just sent him and return what is rightfully mine.. *naive* 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:28:51
I did myself long ago in blockchain.info.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:57:19
No, the 0.0001 I just transferred to him myself with an attached message. My best shot of getting it back, however I certainly don't expect to have it returned.

I assume we both use the app "Bitcoin" made by  As you can see when going through his twitter-feed quite a few have complained about this issue. The decimals seems to work for some, but definitely not all. It did work for me in the past, but not the last three weeks or so. 
EDIT: I think it stopped working after an update.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:52:02
The blockchain app.

@_date: 2013-11-30 13:42:38
I wish. But no, nor in any of my other wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:07:25
I quite like the OS. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:53:37
I wrote to him on twitter. He seems like a decent fellow and blaming him with no basis would be harsh. Technically, what you're mentioning  is probably possible, but I'm not the only user of his app and I haven't heard any other cases like this, so I trust it's not a dev-scam. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:55:27
Yes, I generated a few different addresses within blockchain.info. None are imported.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:06:40
Thanks, Miguel. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:25:06
I did not setup Coinbase, as I don't have an account there. I did setup a paper wallet which had the same decimal issue, then deleted it.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:34:55
Yes, I had balance on other addresses in the wallet. I transferred all funds from the wallet now, so nothing more will be stolen.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:05:02
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:41:31
I didn't. As I wrote; I transferred 1 BTC to my friend and then transferred 0.9 BTC back to myself. So we went drinking with 0.1 BTC. If you want to comment please read through what I wrote first.

Couldn't u make all those exchanges into hyperlinks, so I can at least click and check them out?

I don't recall when I created the addresses, but they were all created from the same machine. I did get email from backup pr email like a month ago, but disabled this feature and deleted the e-mails. However, if they accessed my wallet-backup they would have taken all funds, and not just from this address.

He seems to be a speak before thinking kinda guy, as most Bitcoin-bashers. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:27:08
In my logic chances are small that the app is to blame for this, but thanks for looking into it.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:00:42
I tested with 0.0001 and this amount was not transferred to another account.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:26:49
PM'ed you.
