Try easycrypto, it's a New Zealand based company who I buy from on a regular basis, theyve recently branched out across the Ditch. Fast delivery of coins and top notch customer service.

No worries, they have a solid selection of coins too

Litecoin has a halving in around two Months, I put some BTC into LTC around 10 days ago and so far my profit factor is looking goooooooood ��

Bulgaria is dodgy as fuck. I went there for a holiday to Sunny Beach and the whole strip is run by the Bulgarian mafia. Corruption runs deep in that country. On the plus side you can buy pepper spray, guns, drugs, flick knives and anything else you want from one of the friendly stall holders.

Will you be pulling out ahead of the halvening?

At least the health will be improving greatly, as well as clarity with your thoughts not being intoxicated all the time.

Dont do it. I used to mine so can speak from experience. As others have pointed out, they make a shit load of noise (its unbelievable until you hear it), generate a lot of heat, and are extremely expensive to run. You will be losing more money than you are making daily with the cost of electricity. As others have also pointed out, its just better to put that money into BTC. Also, a normal wired house would only support around two miners with the power they draw, anymore and you'll need to get an electrician to do some wizardry.
