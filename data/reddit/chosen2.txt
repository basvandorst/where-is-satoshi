I bought my first bitcoin as a 60 y/o man and now I'm a 13 y/o boy

let's just say it's not miniscule
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:27:40
A LOT
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:33:50
hey wow dude thanks for the tweets
@_date: 2014-01-14 22:06:54
very wise words, bitcoin changes more than just the economy
@_date: 2014-01-16 21:38:27
the amount of transactions will go up, and the amount of USD in BTC form will also increase. 
Obviously when you use bitcoins as the y axis the graph will become skewed as soon as the price jumps

...thank you

his first 3 predictions basically champion bitcoin as well; in fact the other five predictions would be spurred on by prediction 
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:24:38
for any topic other than bitcoin stories like these would just be annoying, but instead i am grinning like a fool

too true, we just watched the titanic sink, but that doesn't mean the end of oceanliners!

nice tits on l'heroine
@_date: 2014-01-26 05:17:41
you're first on the list
@_date: 2014-03-23 05:43:01
damn that would be rough
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:47:09
Ultimately that is true
the more muscle behind the computations, whether due to processing power or number of machines mining,  will cause the difficulty to rise. The harder it is to create bitcoins, the more value each bitcoin will hold
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:40:12
The more processing power, the smaller the individual reward 
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:36:37
Cheers mate
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:47:01
there are several reasons why bitcoin can and will increase, one being its increasing acceptance. Another reason will be the large influx of processing power during a short period. This will drive up the difficulty. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:43:12
I love advice!

This graph may very well describe the future of bitcoin, because bitcoin is more than a currency; it is a technology. This technology is new. As people discover bitcoin the price will increase, as people begin to see the revolutionary possibilities of bitcoin, the price will skyrocket. There may be, in fact will be, ups and downs, but generally this graph displays the most likely future for BTC

this is not good! or is it...
