This is more about the wasted resources. Obviously BTC can be mined using renewable enegery only .

Give it a try. You may need to add a swap file

This is a great charity!  Basically they teach young girls in patriarchal Afghanistan how to code so that they can find a job and be independent! They obviously accept bitcoin. 
From the website: "Code to Inspire is a nonprofit committed to teaching female students in Afghanistan how to code. "

Yes, it's possible. Follow this tutorial: 
You may also want to create a large swap file (like 2GB)
Good luck!

I mean help by tackling consumerism behaviour. Won't fix environment by itself for sure.

Although I don't agree with a lot of things he says, he is by far the best sceptical I heard so far. We need more of these guys, preferably better informed.

It depends on your wallet. HD wallets normally prompt you to write down a seed which you should store in a safe place. You'd use that seed to recover the private keys that unlock your bitcoin addresses. 
You should consider an hardware wallet.

No, it's just for the fun. You don't have to have a purpose for everything you do.

Fixed. Thanks so much for pointing it.

The problem with running full nodes in Google Cloud is that you are wasting your free 250$  worth of resources in 2 or 3 months and you could be using that credit to learn about other things they have there. 
Full nodes should be preferably be installed on systems where you control the hardware to avoid centralisation, IMHO.
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:04:34
Guys, it's so much better if you run the full node on your Raspberry Pi or so. Putting too many full nodes on Google cloud defeats the purpose on decentralisation, IMHO. 
If you have RP3, just download and install the ARM version of Bitcoin Core (32 bit). Do not try to synchronise the chain from scratch on your Pi as it takes forever. Do it on your laptop, transfer it over and then start your node.
