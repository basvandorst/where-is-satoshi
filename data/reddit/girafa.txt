Yeah it's not terribly uncommon around here to have such a thing. I pay a flat rate for all utilities (water/gas/electric). I'm kinda pissed that it's about $60/mo higher than my old utilities so part of me wants to use the fuck out of the electricity.
Haven't gotten the lease agreement yet though, we're in the "they're fixing shit before we move in" phase.

Pokin around 99bitcoins.com it seems like I'd be earning at least a few hundred $ worth of bitcoins per month (with one rig) with no electric bill.
I'm a greenhorn though, just parroting what I've read.

Ahh coinbase. I tried to create an account with them 3 months ago while I was in Belarus and it's hardcoded my location as that country, despite being a US citizen. Oddly enough among my history is someone trying, and failing, to login to my coinbase account from Japan 12 days ago.
Will fix this shit, thanks. Mind if I pester you with a ? or two if I run into trouble?

I just did it with a different email and it worked. Bought $500 worth! Boom, now that I invested expect this whole thing to tank

Storage is still so f'n confusing for me I'm afraid I'll enter the wrong digit somewhere and delete all of my money.

Which wallet do you use? I have Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin. If that matters.
