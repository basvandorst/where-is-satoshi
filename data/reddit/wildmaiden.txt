It is NOT trolling, idiocy, or FUD to talk about the fees being too high... They self evidently are WAY too high.  Anytime anybody brings it up they are downvoted and called a BCash shill.  It's absurd. 
This is a real problem.  LN is one solution, but it will take a long time to develop and deploy.  2MB block size would help a lot and would be an easy fix.  It's unpopular for political reasons, but it's the truth.
I think something has to be done quickly (as in like immediately) or more companies will stop supporting it like Steam has or decide against supporting it like I'm sure many have.  This problem can't wait several years to be fixed, it will slow down the adoption of the technology tremendously and might encourage companies to turn their focus to other cryptos like Litecoin or Ethereum instead of Bitcoin...

Even Core's own wallet doesn't support Segwit, pretty much nothing does. It's non-trivial to add support for it. Moreover most users don't really know what Segwit is, Coinbase CEO says that Segwit isn't in the top 5 things customers are asking for. It's going to be a while before it gets adopted, that's one of the consequences of backwards compatibility.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:55:50
Customers were asking for BCH support more than they were for Segwit support, at least according to the Coinbase CEO.  I think people understand how BCash works more than they understand how Segwit works, and frankly the propaganda that Ver and company are putting out regarding high fees and slow confirmations seems to resonate with people... It's really easy to understand the bad things about Bitcoin right now, it's a lot harder to understand the solutions (Segwit, LN), especially if you have limited technical understanding of how block chains work to begin with and are using popular tools like Coinbase, Bitcoin Core's wallet, and Bitpay that don't use those solutions anyway.

I see what you're saying - basically the cost to spam and block up the network is about the same, regardless of network capacity, because when capacity is low fees are high but when capacity is high fees are low.  That only makes sense if you are ignoring the non-spam transactions.
What makes it easy to spam right now is that the natural trade volume alone, without any spam, is enough to cause a back log.  You only need to add a little on top of that to create a problem.
If the network capacity were increased, then there would be a lot more space you would need to fill up on your own as a spammer to cause a noticeable problem.

What is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin?  I thought it was fast, cheap, reliable, secure transfers, that was basically the entire value proposition of Bitcoin... It seems now like it only has value because it used to have value, or maybe that people believe it will have value again in the future after Lightning Network is deployed.  As a store of *intrinsic* value though?  I don't see how that can possibly be true long term...  If that's all Bitcoin is to be, it will die.  It has to be a currency or it has no value at all.  Thankfully it will be one again with LN.

You do have to actively seek out services and software that support it (most don't), and you have to create a new segwit address, it doesn't just happen automatically... Users have to understand what it is and how it works on a practical level.  If they don't know what it is, they can't use it.

It's not the easy to implement Segwit though, for example Core's own wallet doesn't even support it.

Obviously they should add Segwit support.  Hopefully they do soon.

It's clearly not enough though, or we wouldn't be having this conversation.  You also need the supporting market infrastructure like Bitpay to use it.


I guess it depends on how you define "worse".  In terms of people choosing Bitcoin over other cryptos (e.g. Litecoin) and in terms of the price of Bitcoin, I think usability probably matters more to the market than decentralization does - at least to a certain point.


I think it's actually a really big deal.  There aren't very many big places where people can actually use Bitcoin (or any crypto for that matter).  Now there's one fewer, and other companies who were considering adopting Bitcoin might decide against it now given Steam's negative user experience...
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:44:44
I'm super optimistic about cryptos long term, but unless Bitcoin can solve the network capacity issues fast - and I'm not confident that LN is very close - I wonder if some other crypto might take it's marketshare.  Retailers interested in accepting cryptos today would not be advised to accept Bitcoin (e.g. Steam's experience), so over the next few years where is the growth going to be?  
I hope LN launches soon!

The market creates the fees within the context and constraints of the network. If you adjust those constraints, for example with LN, then the fees will react accordingly. The problem is the network, not the market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:39:18
That's obviously true for Bitcoin too, maybe even more so...
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:03
The problem is that the network is hard-coded to limit the size of block and thus the number of transactions possible.  Segwit and LN help by taking some things off chain, but there are other ways of increasing the network capacity too...

The market absolutely does care about fees.  Evidence: retailers dropping support specifically because of fees, tons of threads where people complain about fees, every other financial institution competing to keep fees low, etc.
Bitcoin has a huge first to market advantage and great name recognition, but altcoins are also growing and going up in value along with Bitcoin, and at a certain point people will start moving to those if the fee issue isn't solved.

Unfortunately it seems the same thing can be said about Bitcoin now... It might be useful as a store of value, but it's not functional as a currency at this point, that's why Steam has discontinued supporting it.  Hopefully LN will fix a lot of issues, but how far away is that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:47:32
You're delusional if you think the problems Bitcoin has right now are caused by a conspiracy.  Until LN is fully deployed, Bitcoin isn't a currency.  So yeah, there's excitement around other coins like Litecoin and Ethereum that are currently functional.  It's not a conspiracy, it's reality.
And it's true that most people don't know what Segwit is or how to use it.  Almost nothing supports Segwit.  Major exchanges?  No.  Major wallets?  No.  Payment services like Bitpay?  No.

Agreed 100%.  But we're not at the ideal.  The current reality is that most services don't support it, so most users don't benefit from it.  The only way you can benefit from it is if you know what it is and seek out the few services that do support it.  If you don't know what it is, you're probably using the popular services and software that don't support it, and your user experience sucks right now (high fees, slow confirmations).  Most people are in that category.  The last time I saw numbers on it, it was something like 90% of BTC transactions don't use Segwit (this was in September I believe).  Maybe that's gone down recently, but I doubt it.  Segwit isn't a solution if nobody uses it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:54:51
Coinbase CEO says that BCash support is a higher priority for their customers than Segwit support is.  I think Segwit is something most people don't understand, so they don't know how much they want it or need it.


They chose BCash over Segwit for this purpose.  I guess they believe it's less confusing to have two coins then to have two different types of addresses in the same coin.  Maybe a lesson here about soft-forks for future upgrades - if the update is backwards compatible, it will take a long time for the market to support it, longer than it takes to support an entirely new coin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:19:20
Why would Coinbase care about Ver or be sabotaging Bitcoin?  This conspiracy stuff makes no sense.
The Coinbase CEO recently gave an interview on CNBC where he was asked about Segwit and said it wasn't in the top 5 things customers were demanding.  It takes resources to implement something like Segwit, and they have apparently prioritized those resources to other things (like ID verification, platform stability, and adding alt-coins).
It's not a conspiracy.  The problem is nobody knows what Segwit is, or how it works, or why it's important.  Slow adoption is a consequence of soft-forking to maintain backwards compatibility...

If we look at the last comment on this Stack Exchange post, posted the same day as this puzzle (coincidence?), it might have some clues: 
Possibly related to the clue "00212121"?  If we replace the 2's with their binary equivalent (10), we get 00101101101, which is 11 bits just as in the example hashing, and equals 365 in decimal.

This works by admitting that you are not capable of timing the market.  Instead, you buy a fixed amount on a fixed schedule, no matter what the current price is.  That means if the price is low, you buy more, if the price is high, you buy less, but it happens automatically because you are always buying exactly $20 worth (or whatever amount).

Well that's the whole trick here.  The "normal" baseline market price is set by exchanges.  If you have enough capital to manipulate the exchange prices, you can drive the price down (both OTC and exchange prices), then buy again at the lower price.  If you buy such a large volume from the exchanges though, the prices will increase and you won't profit, but if you buy OTC your purchases are kind of "off record" and aren't factored into the exchange prices and you can buy much more than you sold at a lower than fair-market price.  
I'm not sure how an OTC seller can differentiate between a whale manipulating the exchange prices vs the price naturally falling.

This is already accounted for with interest rates... Dollars are depreciating, but that doesn't make it easier for you to pay back loans because the interest rates get higher and higher as the dollar gets weaker and weaker.

Why not?  Debt is debt, a budget is a budget, interest is interest, the only difference is the scale.  The analogy is useful in showing that the budget cuts are a joke and don't even come close to closing the deficit.  Even if this was a crisis period, it's not like the debt went back down after the crisis... That debt is all still there, and then some.  It's one thing to say "we have 5 years of infrastructure budgeted, let's expedite that and do it all now to stimulate the economy" or something, it's another to say "let's spend a bunch of money we don't have now, and then do it again next year, and every year from now on into eternity".

Using Bitcoin is not any harder than using Apple Pay (for example).  It's easier to get Bitcoin than it is to get a credit card, but people don't complain that credit card applications are too complicated for the mass public.
A bigger issue than ease of use is confidence and trust.  People are conditioned to understand and trust credit card systems.  If credit cards didn't exist already and you were trying to introduce them, people would be skeptical, just like they are with Bitcoin right now.

My grandpa couldn't do either, but younger generations have no problem with Apple Pay and if they cared to learned how it worked (like they had to do with Apple Pay), they wouldn't have any problem with Bitcoin either. 
You're right that there's a risk and trust issue that is, in my mind, a separate but important issue from usability.  Before services like Zelle launched (due to competition from technologies like Bitcoin), it was WAY easier to digitally pay my buddies with Bitcoin than with dollars.  The technology is improving every day, in both crypto and fiat spaces.  I don't think the biggest obstacle for Bitcoin is usability, it's really very easy to use.  The other issues are a much bigger barrier - mass adoption, trust, risk, security (of your own keys, not of the network), etc.

Not necessarily.  If the BTC price goes down, people might have a favorable view that it will go back up in a year, so GBTC price goes up.  If the price is going up rapidly, you might be more cautious that it will come back down to reality in a year.

They obviously do have power to lead though... That's why people care about what miners are doing, miners have the ability to "vote" via hashpower, and miners are a critical resource for any cryptocurrency to succeed - if the miners are all going somewhere else, that's a problem, and investors will follow them.  That's not what's happening here, but you can't conclude that miners are only following the money, the money is also following the miners.  It's a more complicated relationship than you're describing, no matter how many times you repeat it to yourself or "type it out".

Except you do that again, every single year, so even though you already owe $90, you're now also spending $2,180 this year, and not paying any of that $90 back... also the economy NEVER grows at 8%, it very rarely even hits 3%, so there's an obvious problem with the "grow out of debt" plan.

Sure, but that recourse helps add to the level of trust I have in that system.  Visa isn't going to screw me, and if they do I can sue them.  Because of that, I don't really need to know the details of how their payment network functions in order to feel reasonably confident using it.  Bitcoin doesn't have that option, which is one of the things that makes it so great, you don't need to trust somebody like Visa, but that also puts the responsibility back onto the users and the users alone, so security matters a lot more.

And in any case, it could be BOTH a store of wealth and a currency, there's no reason to choose one over the other... Bitcoin has only a single value proposition, unlike Gold which has intrinsic value, Bitcoin is only valuable because of how efficient the network is, which right now is not very efficient at all... High fees are obviously an immediate problem, and clearly the biggest issue right now.

But it's true (or nearly true) according to the [Brookings Institute]( Only 30% of people born into the top quintile stay there, and 25% fall into the bottom 2 quintiles. Of those born into the top that don't get an education, they are actually more likely to end up in the bottom than stay at the top. Being born rich gives you an advantage, but it's far from an automatic ticket to wealth.

That's what happened to gold-backed currencies, they became fiat.

OP was referring to the founding fathers... I assumed by "left England" he meant declared Independence, whereas you interpreted it as literally left on their feet.  OP is right if talking about founding fathers, probably still right if talking about the Pilgrims who left for religious freedom and other early settlers who left to make better lives for themselves.  I don't think it's even remotely fair to state that America was founded by "rich perverts".  Even if they did come for the sole purpose of reducing their tax burden, OP would STILL be right - excessive taxes ARE government oppression...

We're talking about the US... and even in other parts of the world that don't have it as good, they are still doing much much better than those same parts were doing even just a few decades ago. It's getting better there too!
There is simply no way ancient man lived as comfortably as we do today working 10 hours a week. That's just laughably absurd on its face. For one thing, almost all people in history were slaves, serfs, or peasants who barely even subsisted, much less thrived the way we do in the west.
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:20:46
We might be able to do better, but given this is the best it's ever been it's hard to say how much better it could be (we've never seen it be better).  "Could do better" is a far cry from "fighting for scraps".  
In the US, everybody can see a doctor, life is not a struggle at $112,000 a year, and the job market is strong (so you're not 1 job loss away from homelessness), most people take vacations (17 days on average), and most people retire at 65.  That is not true everywhere in the world, but it is true in the US.
I don't understand why people seem so desperate to view things pessimistically, when all the evidence is to the contrary.  People live longer then ever, with more access to resources than ever, in a safer world than ever... This is the best time to be alive, but people think things are getting worse... It doesn't make sense.

Are they?  I think a lot of people got out and lost interest once the price dropped and the media buzz evaporated.  I don't think any of your other assertions are true either - more money being put into it, easier to use, more companies accepting it, price going up - literally none of that is happening as far as I can tell.  I believe in the technology as much as anybody, but I think it's going to take something monumental to drive the price up again.  
It's like what happened with gold.  The price shot up, and then dropped, and now every year you hear about how THIS is the year for gold, but it never is.  It doesn't make gold a bad investment or a bad idea, but the speculation seems to be always wrong and based on previous outliers instead of the clear and slow trend.

They wanted to split from the Church of England, but that was basically treason (remember no separation of church and state).  So they came to America.

It's not the same people in those categories from 1981-2007 though... The people who are the richest 1% today won't be next year, and the poorest 20% won't be the poorest forever.

Missing the point.  The value you gain in BTC (if any) has nothing to do with you keeping or selling your BCC.  If BCC crashes to 0 while you're holding it, you're losing value.
It makes sense to hold BCC if you think it will take off.
It does not make any sense to hold BCC because "it's free, so it can't lose value".

Tell that to people who shop at Target, Noodles, Sony PSN, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.  Just by using a credit card, you open yourself up to theft.
Which is preferred?: an insecure system prone to leaks and theft, but which is insured by an issuing authority like Visa so the users aren't liable, or a more secure system which isn't as risky, but for which there is no hope of recovery in case of a breach? I don't know.  Maybe both have a place in the world.
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:08:28
You actually would need to measure your basis every time you spend, just not when you exchange for a "like kind" currency (i.e. crypto-to-crypto trades).  If you're buying something with crypto, you'd still have to pay taxes on the gains made while holding the crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:46:46
I don't think there is a limit. The idea is to tax gains, not punish losses. The whole thing is stupidly complicated though.

Coinbase is a trusted steward of my private keys, but they are not a "trusted third-party" that processes payments from one person to another, which is what Satoshi is talking about.


We can still do that, even if I use Coinbase.  The transaction doesn't go through Coinbase, it goes through the network and blockchain just like any other Bitcoin transaction.  You don't have to trust Coinbase at all for me to send you Bitcoin.  
Satoshi also said:

Yes, I do have Bitcoin.  Full stop.  Just because I store my Bitcoin with a convenient and secure service doesn't mean I don't own them.  Is there a risk in trusting a third party?  Of course.  Is there a risk in managing your own keys?  Absolutely.  Everybody is free to evaluate the risks for themselves, but don't tell me I'm doing it wrong just because I'm not doing it your way.

Absolutely.  But mining doesn't "produce it".  That's like saying the government printing dollar bills is generating wealth.  The actual value of Bitcoin has nothing to do with turning wasted electricity into money, just like printing money doesn't make society richer.

You can actually carry losses into future years ("loss carryforward"), and you can carry them back into previous years to retroactively adjust your previous years' tax liability ("loss carryback").  If you're in that position, you should hire a tax attorney to help figure it out.  It's not true that you cannot offset gains and losses in different years - you can.  It's complicated though, and that's a fair point.  This law would eliminate this additional complication too.  
At the end of the day, you pay taxes on your gains.  It doesn't matter when you compute the gains, it's the same gain and the same tax liability - but requiring people to treat every transaction as a taxable event greatly increases the administrative complexity.

Only your trades for other cryptos (i.e. "like kind" tades) would not be taxed.  If you trade back into USD it would be taxed as normal.  Under the current rules, every time you trade crypto at all it's considered a "taxable event" and you are required to measure gains and pay taxes on those.  The actual amount of tax you pay in the long run doesn't change either way, just when you measure the gain - either at point of converting to or from USD (easy) or you document every single trade you've ever made and compute the cost-basis and figure it out somehow (impossibly hard for most of us).
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:31:44

@_date: 2018-12-21 17:02:00
Just to clarify - your actual tax liability doesn't change whether you pay 30% gains tax on crypto-to-crypto trades or pay the 30% on the ultimate gains when converting to cash - it's the same amount of money going to the government.  The only difference is when and how it's computed.  The current policy is absurdly difficult to adhere to, the proposed one is very easy.  Actual taxes owed doesn't change.
