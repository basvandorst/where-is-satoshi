So it starts: 


And then they actually perform the service you pay for, 3 weeks late:


Come on...  Sure, great that your money wasn't *stolen* but it's hardly a demonstration of amazing customer service...

I imagine it'd be the same thing as leaving euro notes in america.  Basically you tipped the server an errand that they might not even know how to handle.
And most servers split the tips, pain in the butt for foreign currency...

Succinct and absolutely great!  Thanks!

For those who are interested, here's the FinCEN document for Registration of a Money Services Business
Specificially, these key bullets:
The term money services business includes:
1. Currency dealers or exchangers who exchange
more than $1,000 **for any one customer** on any
2. Check cashers who cash checks totaling more
than $1,000 **for any one customer** on any day.
(emphasis mine)

Paypal handles all disbutes through arbitration, and it's very easy for one party to scam the other.  50,000$ is about 49,900$ more than I would trust Paypal with.

Though I've only a year of economics and *some* technical analysis to build off of, I personally only trust a man acting in his own gain.  He's predictably rational, acting in his own best interest.  The more irrationalities that affect a buyer/seller makes the market more volatile and more likely to attract only speculative traders.  Just my opinion.

Good job buddy, you've accomplished a goal of my own today!  I'll drink to that.

Most of these exchanges only handle 500$ per user per day, which is 1/2 of the amount required for regulation and reporting as a money services business.  So *legally* they're not wrong.
But for example in bitfloor's case, the funds weren't seized, just the bank refused service for an arbitrary reason.

If you disable UAC it's the same thing as granting every program administrator privelages, letting it go wherever and do anything it wants to your system, and you'd never even know.

Wow, now this is a gravy train!
Q: Why don't seagulls fly over bays?
A: Because then they'd be bagels!

Does bitcoin count as a currency?  Or as a physical item being sold?  Of course it's digital, but does that make a difference?  I've seen services that 'print' bitcoin by encoding private addresses into physical media.  Would I be able to point to specific regulation if push comes to shove?
If that's the case then that makes the whole concept a lot easier.  A money services business would be a well-defined model I could follow.  I believe that being a legitimate tax-paying business would promote a lot of good will towards my local city council, as well as further 'legitimizing' bitcoin.
I plan on at least making my entire area aware of what bitcoin is, for good or ill.  I would PREFER to be the one to provide this service...  But I believe it's a great platform for financial freedom, regardless!
Thanks for pointing me in the right direction!

[ ( - this is also why websites should salt their passwords.  It's the same salt for every user and if the site is hacked it is retrievable, but the idea is the hacker would have to build a new hashlist because every word has some letter combination tacked on, increasing the time cost.

That really is unfortunate, I used them just today and it has always (except once) been very pleasant and quick.  Just the way I like it!  I've just seen that trend lately with all the exchanges going under; everyone is so relieved to finally get their money they forget to get angry!
Glad your money made it though!
