You know what's even better? POS

I disagree. At this point developing the best medium of exchange should absolutely be the priority, and the fact btc people have deluded themselves on this regard is why I sold all my bitcoin 12 months ago. Storage of value is an important piece of the puzzle yes but EVERY COIN can pretty much do this effectively now. Now the focus within the crypto community has largely moved on to value of exchange and BTC folks are stuck in the Stone Age.
If you compare BTC with other top cryptocurrencies in terms of storage of value there's very little difference. Most utilize the blockchain to some extent, so now the only difference that is separating most of the coins is their ability to exchange value. So what justifies bitcoins current  spot in terms of marketcap if there are 99 coins identical in terms their storage of value but that are better, faster, and cheaper than BTC.
If you add on top of that the seemingly incapable ability of Bitcoin core to deliver on their promises than you have a recipe for disaster.
I'll get downvoted/banned for this but fuck Bitcoin. It's all hype at this point.

How is LN anything like POS? (besides being a scaling solution)

I mean Ripple can already do more txs than any other coin at the moment and cheaper. But it seems transactional use is not the primary demand for investors...
 I think that day is coming though.. and whichever coin scales the most successfully while also retaining its decentralization will be the winner.
I do think there will be a one coin to rule them all so to speak... 
Personally I'm excited about what the ETH folks are planning and their overall vision for what blockchain tech can do.

Except it's proven that IRL people end up hoarding money and not spending it which hurts economy...

I mean it's still in its early stages. Wouldn't be complicated at all to setup payment systems for energy companies and grocery stores. Bitpay already exists. Not enough people are demanding it at the moment though.
