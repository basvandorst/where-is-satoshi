What's the NYA? are you referring to that one split of something that didn't happen?
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:39:52
Right exactly. Every financial market relies almost entirely on speculation influenced by past, current, and planned future events. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:10:30
you'll probably still get charged then. be careful and check your account for the next week

Maybe it's indicative of the current value in terms of fiat, but OP is saying that the TRUE value of it lies in its future potential, technology, and other shit like that. It's like looking at a McDonalds business in the 60s and saying that this one restaurant is worth $200,000 instead of realizing that the company's business model and setup could be worth millions or even billions

How do you know?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:09:14
Is it realistically possible to change the core tech behind BTC to make it as fast as coins like stellar ?
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:48:44
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:01:13
this needs to be top comment, or honestly you should make a post about this

If someone steals your cold storage hardware wallet, they have zero access to your Bitcoin unless they know the codes to enable access, which they will not.  When you buy it and set it up you write down on paper your seed key and private keys and other info, and keep it locked away extremely safe in a fireproof environment (like an actual metal safe for example).  If you lose your hardware wallet or it dies somehow, you can always retrieve your coins as long as you know your keys and other necessary info.
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:46:33
Very true I didn't think about that

I understand you've never experienced such a rapid loss of money before, but every new investor goes through this and must be strong and patient.  Literally it is the single most common mistake of ANY new investor. DO NOT SELL FOR A LOSS. DON'T SELL FOR A LOSS AND TRY TO BUY DOWN THE DIP ALSO. You will get raped by fees and likely miss the bounce back anyway, and when you see it rising again you'll panic and buy less coins for more money, and then when you go to sleep youll be angry and frustrated and want to cry for losing money.  YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOST SHIT UNTIL YOU PANIC SELL. DON'T FUCKING PANIC SELL
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:00:17
Your post history is filled with bullshit about crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:19:09

THIS A FUCKING HOURLY CHART. Fuck off asshole 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:42:14
Don't panic sell dude.  I made that mistake when I was down $2,600.  If I had waited patiently for a bit I would have been back at profits. 
Come back here in two weeks and i can guarantee you'll be glad you listened.  Or you can sell for a loss right now, but just make sure you come back to my post in two weeks to realize you should have listened
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:23:10
DONT PANIC SELL, MAINSTREAM ADOPTION IS JUST BEGINNING

I want a way to store my money in cold storage (I have a ledger nano s) that can't be stolen or taken from me whatsoever.

@_date: 2017-11-30 08:29:00
You don't seem to understand the "crypto" part of cryptocurrency, aka cryptography (the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries).  It is extremely difficult to steal off the exchanges, and once kept in cold storage its virtually impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:34:13
It is Coinbase's exchange for more advanced users.  Be careful when using it, there's no confirmations when doing things, as it is often used for trading. Selling with a market sale will be a bit of a cost, but never as much as Coinbase's beginner friendly site.  Here is:
There's no app for it either but it can be used on mobile browser if you're on the go.  But I highly recommended to never do that as one wrong button press and you could be out coins or fiat.  Better to use it on a real computer
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:11:42
what price point did you buy in?
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:27:47
shit son, you think we'll rise all the way to 15k already? i heard lots of analysts predict that as months away.  But then again..... Every past prediction has usually been outdone
Example lol, quote from this CNBC article from 7/31/17:


in reality we hit that legit a month and a half later or so after this article was published
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:52:18
You think so? God I really hope so. Any intuition on when you personally believe to see that number?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:27:50
Says every onlooker for months and months on end. I guarantee you'll say this again in 6 months. BUY FINALLY
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:04:21
holy fuck that hurt so bad to think about. i feel so bad for OP
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:50:31
Nooo I have a ledger nano S lol. I meant that's why I like Bitcoin, my money is secure more than anything

use GDAX. if you buy or sell with limit orders that you placed before anyone else than you will incur no fees. Coinbase owns gdax so you can use the same account info to login
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:47:53
not every exchange charges fees. GDAX doesn't if you know how to use it properly

That is until theres a fire in your house or it floods or you're house gets sacked and burglarized or someone finds your goddamn paper.  Someone finds your ledger nano and they can't do shit with your money

fuck yes you are awesome man. 
When dealing with darkness and emptiness from mental issues, life soon can deteriorate until the point when you have no will to live and can't go on much longer. 
Crypto has helped keep me busy too and has 100% helped my mental illness, and I've been down 3600 and now finally almost up again. Learned so much about it along the way, and am glad I proved to myself I could keep a promise to get involved in something I wanted to start doing  
Mental illness can drive us to actually lie six feet under, never to exist again. But I'm glad you're staying strong, and remember you're not the only one who deals with this horrible affliction, so blaming yourself isn't the truth. And meds and life changes can truly change things. It's not too late 
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:48:25
Ever heard of the gold standard? Gold is useless. Yes you can wear it and its shiny, but it cant feed you, keep you warm, clothe you, have sex with you, nothing.  So why does it have some arbitrary value of 700 dollars an ounce or something? If you're cold and sell you cow for gold, thats useless. But its because it represents finite value, in the same way that Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:21:04
if you need help with getting your coins into one location ask redditors here for help.  Good luck man. Just trying to help, really don't want to see someone else make the same super painful mistakes I made.  Just hold and buy even more if u want when it dips.
My ultimate recommendation is to NOT trade whatsoever.  Out of all the over 50 or more trades I made on GDAX over many months, the majority were unsuccessful, incurred fees, and caused me INTENSE fucking anxiety for literally hours regardless of whether or not I went up at all.
My other strongly heeded advice is stop checking the price. It will only cause you to think emotionally instead of logically.  My advice is to get a push email automation set up with specific limits so you know without checking when something happens.  I used to check the price like 50 times a day.  Now I'm committed to holding and checking the price twice a week at max.  
It's more important to live life in the meantime and focus on other things because investments really really do take time to grow, and watching it daily is like getting frustrated watching the grass grow because its not going fast enough.  Much better to check your lawn two weeks later and see how rapidly its grown
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:13:54
Then you'll have enough cash left over to buy a Tesla side-hoe
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:37:53
for sure.  I know how awful it feels to panic and not be able to breathe.  Just don't check the price for two weeks, that's really what I recommend.  Focus on other things and forget you even invested. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:27:58
When do you personally expect a slaughtering?

I actually had six ketamine infusions for $2200 back in last January, and it provided no antidepressant relief. Before that for years I tried many stimulants, 12 antidepressants, TMS therapy, years of talk therapy, exercise, diet, hobbies, socializing, girls and relationships, meditation and tons more.   
After a while my outlook on life has become extremely peaceful, but my severely out of wack emotions and depression are still here.  
Finally three months ago I got on the MAOI Nardil and after two months for about two weeks when it kicked in I felt genuinely normal for the first time in my whole life.  It was the first time in 1.5 years I could see my last breakup clearly, and finally understood why I acted how I did my entire life, as my severely dark depression was always there with me, I just had no idea what was wrong with me.  For those two weeks I finally enjoyed being alive and I cried over and over because looking at buildings, trees, and just going through life didn't give me the energy of ultimate emptiness and death.  It since pooped out and was working only on and off, and so I'm about to start it's sister medicine Parnate tomorrow.  It's been one week since I've stopped Nardil and this withdrawal has been so severe on my emotions, that today was undoubtedly the most empty and darkly emotional I've ever felt before.  
I'm hoping dearly Parnate works, and after FINALLY having real relief on and off on Nardil after countless attempts for relief with other medications, I do know that the way I've felt my whole life wasn't my fault.  On Nardil I could finally understand why life is so much easier and just peaceful for healthy individuals.

it's when big holders of coin buy big and then everyone starts to buy as price rises and then the big holders drop big to make massive profit while everyone immediately panics and sells. it's an artificial way to inflate prices and make profit

@_date: 2017-09-04 09:45:13
this has got to be the worst news ever since then. won't this likely cause the second biggest crash ever?? America is still asleep! when they're up litecoin and bitcoin could drop to insanely low levels
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:54:41
bitcoin and litecoin are sinking heavily though!
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:50:00
Do you think when the west coast wakes up they'll buy like crazy or will they panic sell?
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:37:00
should we sell? I bought LTC at 85, a lot, what should i do???
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:45
what's that mean?
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:53:44
I sold my Litecoin at 53 I'm really hoping it sinks further so I can buy at 45. do you think this is possible at all?  I'm nervous because BTC and LTC are rising right now
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:29
well now it's sinking....
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:15:44
no one can say. its all ultimately an estimated guess. buy a little at a time if you want. youll just spend more in fees likely

well now it's sinking....
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:48:30
Right and that's EXACTLY what im thinking. This sub is starting to look like Donald Trump supporters yelling fake news at everything they don't want to believe. That's why I'm afraid to trust people's opinions here right now, because they seem to be based off emotion instead of logic. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:05:51
do you really think it will go up again? I bought Litecoin at 85 and feeling super shitty right now. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:43:17
so you think even for litecoin and stuff this will be okay in the end? even if it takes a couple weeks or more to recover? i'm really high and im afraid now the crypto market is changed forever and litecoin and bitcoin are fucked and there will never also be ways to make money from small coins. im afraid this is the worst crash ever, im really high please help
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:05:31

I think it will dip again, this looks like a pump
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:17:13
typical for saturdays. weekends suck no matter what usually. doesnt mean there might be another dip, but all i know is weekends usually suck before it recovers during the week usually
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:55:12
do you think it will keep going up and hit 100?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:08:45
what's that mean?
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:49:43

@_date: 2017-09-04 15:35:24
are you being serious or sarcastic? I'm the dude that got high and was panicking. I'm still panicking from last night

you really think so? this isnt the worst crash and crypto isnt dead? you think litecoin will ever hit 85 again? sorry im really scared because im really high. i smoked a bit and then got a notifcation on my phone litecoin slipped hard
