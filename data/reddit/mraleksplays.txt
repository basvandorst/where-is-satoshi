iddnu were he fuckes up. but its pretty fucking simple. sent hundreds of transactions. easy, never had any problems. okay, there was this one time that i paid too little fee. took 5 days to get them. this noobs btc isnt gone, he can see the btc in the transaction logg. so yeah he had too little fee.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:42:20
dude. it wil either take some days to get thru or dropped by the network... (if that happens they wil return).. noob
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:03:11
HAHH a flaw? its called "too small fee, so the transaction is stuck"  NOTHING ELSE.. it wil either go thru in somd days or it wil be dropped in two weeks. this bitch decided that he wanted to be greedy and take a fee far bdlow recommended. iddnu. this kid can blame himself

@_date: 2017-12-22 09:35:46
yeah ik, but it's kinda the only place i can but btw without ID verification. so my only option would be to buy some more, send it from the same wallet to the same exchange, and put more fee on the transaction. btw do you reccomend å website were you can buy btc with visa? thanks
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:30:59
cool site, never used google trends myself. keep it up, maybe you could try to go with a coinsmarketcap widget or smt for each coins showing up. i know there is a small coinsmarket cap logo but i know how to remove it pretty easily. keept it up dude!! Btw merry christmas
