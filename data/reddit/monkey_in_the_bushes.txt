Amen. But at the same time I don’t mind BTC moving to stronger hands.

Yeah but if you want 100% control over your funds you can have it. If people leave their funds on exchanges then they’re not properly taking advantage of crypto (it’s essentially a bank at that point)
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:12:43


Ummm banks get "hacked" way more than Bitcoin has (ie never).  Idiot.

Buying locally is harder than going through a fiat gateway. So the market demands that they pay a premium.

MOON MEMES OR GTFO (as my net worth is now 10% of what it was in January... sob...)

Leave the bullshit politics at the door. And there's a difference between censoring an opposing view versus removing batshit crazy conspiracy theorists from your platform (who are essentially yelling "fire" in a crowded theater)
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:02:39
I know right? There's gonna be a bitcoin ETF someday, just let this happen
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:18:58
You’re doing god’s work, sir.

Entrenched rich folks used to getting their way forever feeling nervous about having to share some of their pie. Cute!

Amazing story! Curious how you did the transaction? Did you send him the coins first and then he handed over the cash when he saw the confirmation?
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:45:05

This is today's best meme post. Try again tomorrow everyone else.

Not every project requires its own currency. 
That being said, if you start your own project which runs on say, BTC, it will be hard to develop it unless you have a huge stockpile beforehand. Creating your own token and selling those in the beginning gives you "investment" capital to start with and enough of the utility token to power it through development and past launch.

No ethereum. Downvoted.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:07:34
They see the gains we made and want to capitalize on it :\

Locked and loaded, captain!

Lovely. Can someone edit this so it has the BTC logo over his head?
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:02:08
@_date: 2018-04-10 23:26:57
Don't run away it's only me...
@_date: 2018-07-28 00:48:00
Not gonna downvote (or upvote) you, but why the frustration? For sure, BTC doesn't need an ETF to succeed (it's doing perfectly fine without it) but I'll never say no to some accelerated gains :)
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:58:48
Because they’re the only fiat game in town.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:10:20
Lol even works with exchanges
