Cool. I guess the memory on sim cards should be at least as reliable as microSD, probably more. If so, it should reliably hold data for 5-10 years no problem.

Why a sim card, and not a microSD card for instance?

I haven't been following, but how much % of this do they actually control? I'm guessing they have some hashpower that is controlled directly by them, but most of it still controlled by participating miners. No?

What about heroin? Pretty sure it's illegal everywhere (at least on paper). Lots of competitive advantage in growing and distributing. No one does tho (at a state level).

Yeah, that I know, but the use of this power has to be completely transparent. I don't see how they could hide anything out of the ordinary without getting caught.
I assume that if they do get caught abusing this power, they will lose most of it the following days.
The only thing that worries me is how much of that 50% is under their direct control.

A little hard to do in 7 days as a nobody. But this isn't a fair challenge.
Note, that if someone has access to the Google index (for instance, a Google employee), for them the challenge is pretty straight forward.
I'm not sure how long it would take to sha256 every reasonably long continuous sequence of words in that index, but considering that Google are able to search it suggests it is far from infeasible. I'd say, doable in 7 days. Albeit, probably not worth just 1 BTC.

It's an amusing thought, but just to be clear, ISIS poses zero threat to Israel, unlike many European states that you'd consider more "secure".
By the way, west of Syria there is Lebanon, where Hezbollah (a terrorist group that has control of the country) is already lined up at the border ready to fight... And has been so since the last time they did, in 2006. Nevertheless, they haven't dared to escalate the situation in 8 years now. Considering Hezbollahs raw "military" power, ISIS as a threat, pales in comparison.
The only real threat to Israel besides Hezbollah is the terrorist group that controls Gaza, which I'm sure, you've heard of plenty this summer. Needless to say, they don't pose a real threat to a place like Caesarea which is too far north for their rockets to reach (even if they could pierce our infamous air defense system).
TL;DR: Israel is not like what you see on the news.

Yes, but remember, this is new. At some point the creators will tap into this money themselves. This "bullshit" is just a vacuum being filled by someone else. It very well could "force" creators to adopt the very same model in the far future (btc for torrents). This is good for us.

No. The mainstream media is not important in this case. Neither are mainstream opinions. A distributed black market that works does not need any marketing or advertising. We gain nothing if the public opinion is in its favor, and we lose nothing if it is not. 
The whole point of it is that the opinions of anyone except the participants don't matter one bit. If they do, than it doesn't work. 
For those who will participate, the name of the thing doesn't matter anyway. If anything, for them, it'll be better to call it what it is. A black market.

He means that if he sets up a malicious TOR exit node, and some one that uses TOR to palce a bet goes through his node, he can change the bitcoin address on the page. This is super easy. I can do this right now.
And yes, doing *anything* of value on the web today without HTTPS should not even be considered as an option.

So now coffee would cost 3470 bits? This is just as bad as before, just in the opposite direction.
Worse, I would be horrified (as a newb) to find out that my currency unit is no longer "infinitely divisible". That would seriously contradict the common "knowledge" that money is represented by real numbers (and not integers).
I think that the reasonable compromise, (and by the way something almost everyone already does), is using mBTC as the denomination. This is the one that makes most sense right now. A coffee would cost 3.4mBTC.
Also, "bits" is a really bad name.
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:07:08
Well, I use bitcoin to buy stuff, and many of the people on this forum do. In fact, I'd dare say that the only thing that matters is *our* experience right now (and by "our", I also mean newbs that are joining in the _near_ future). Whatever happens in 50 years, the denomination can and will be changed accordingly in time.

Basically what you're saying is that the GHash problem is just a status-quo problem, and can be solved simply by GHash falling offline for a short while...
Theoretically speaking, if they stop sending out work, the hashrate would drop to 50% of its former value. You'd know that the problem is solved once the hashrate climbs back up, but they are still down. I don't think this needs to be more than a day of downtime.
At that point the hashpower would be re-distributed to the other pools, with the most "attractive" one (hopefully, p2pool) getting most of it. They will never regain 50% power again. Am I wrong?

Getting money across borders.
Personally, I use it for weak anonymity online.
@_date: 2016-12-26 06:25:03
Sure. I just made it a bit harder for people to know who I am or what I do online. In order for someone to find out, they now need to exert some effort (money) to investiigate.  Puts me in a far better position than most other folks.

From OPs comment:
"... many people will insist that side x is demonic and side y heavenly and many others will insist the inverse. I believe this is an artefact of the human proclivity to sculpt a narrative of good guys and bad guys..."
Good job demonstrating that point.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:25:52
LOL. especially with the blocksize on that chain. Transactions will *never* go through.
Most of the userbase will probably immediately switch to the chain that actually works. We need to remember that for most users, bitcoin is money. Not a cool science project.

Look at your public key QR code. Every square is either black or white. Binary.
Now look at the pixelated private key. Every square is now a various _shade_ of grey. Analog.
Basically, you've converted digital data into analog in some "arbitrary" fashion. However, the data is probably mostly still there.

A split, with UASF nodes on the wrong side of a hard fork.
Be 100% certain that most exchanges will switch to transacting on the winning side within *minutes*.
If it happens quick, the price may even not crash. In this case, the UASF will have had no effect at all (except for fucking up on-chain transactions made by UASF nodes). At that point, it's 1MB blocks until further notice.
edit: USAF FTW

This is *not* a panacea for the security of your wallet!
Even if you run this on a computer that is not connected to the internet at all (and never will be), there is still the concern about the software used to generate your keys!
You can't just trust some software on some CD to generate keys for you. It could either have been backdoored in advance, or the CD could have been swapped on the way to you.
If the random number generator is somehow compromised, any keys you create are no longer secure. A "backdoor" doing this could be *anywhere* in the software stack on the CD. 
I advise doing key generation only with software / hardware that you know you can (at least minimally) trust.

About 6000 passwords attempted by far.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:01:31
Well, I'm running it now.
Modified the C# code from  and added a "Crack" button :)
Running against a password list generated by John the Ripper. Total 866495 combinations!
I'm not running this in parallel (yet), and the sad benchmarks for the "cracker" are:
About 88 passwords a minute :(
This will thus take, at the worst, 9846 minutes, or 6.8 days.

This, right here, is the thing that can kill the MAFIAA, the record industry, and the entire copyright lobby altogether.
The petty consequence of enabling piracy by making it profitable is almost meaningless.
Imagine being able to publish something non-free, without any worry about hosting it, distributing it, or collecting for it. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:49:34
No. If this was the case, the transaction would still appear.
If an address isn't on the blockchain, it had never held any money.
@_date: 2013-12-07 21:29:16
You sure this wallet contained anything?
Searching for a partial address is possible on blockexplorer, for example.
Here is a random part from some bitcoin address that appears in the blockchain (had actual transactions)
As you can see, I've chosen a random substring of the address, and it found it.
Here is the same for a part of your address:
Nothing found.

The keyspace I accounted for is all typable chars on a US keyboard.
Obviously a 48bit brute force of scrypt is unachievable by some guy on reddit.

Perhaps you should also consider incorporating some proof of existance element (via the blockchain), so that an author can prove ownership of their content. Later it should be more difficult to distribute a pirate (cheaper) copy.

Not an "expert", but I can try an ELI5:
1) Bitcoin transactions aren't just "A sends X to B". Each "transaction" is actually a short peace of _executable code_. The "language" of this code is called "Script". It's part of the bitcoin protocol.
2) Such a "Script" usually dictates what information is necessary for coins to be spent. For example, such info could be a valid signature from a holder of a single private key.
3) When you "own" bitcoins, all it means is that there are "Scripts" in the blockchain which demand information that _only you_ can provide (again, like a signature).
4) This works really well for "A sends X to B" transactions, and this is pretty much all that is implemented in modern bitcoin clients.
5) However, since (theoretically) any conditions could be provided in the "Script", an infinite realm of new "transaction types" opens up. These can be called contracts.
6)  A "Script" could, for example, say the following: "A sends X to B, but this will happen at &lt;DATE&gt;". Once this is in the blockchain, "A" can't take it back, and "B" knows that he'll get the money at &lt;DATE&gt;, and not sooner.
7) In theory, a "Script" could rely on external sources of information. For instance, a website that holds census data. 
8) A "Script" could say "A sends X to B, but only when &lt;PERSON&gt; is dead according to &lt;WEBSITE&gt;". This example is a will written into the Bitcoin blockchain.
9) The possibilities are endless. Contracts could involve more parties than just A and B, and have far more complex conditions. The "external information" sources are limited only by the Trust people are willing to give them.
To sum up, this is very much possible in theory. It is likely some of this will be implemented soon too.

1) Saved as an image, monospace font, obviously OCR isn't the way to go.
2) OP said that he remembers the "procedure" for decoding this, meaning it's unlikely that he has some sort of random "mask" that is placed on the image to filter out the noise.
3) It is, however, likely that the procedure does involve some "graphical" masking of this image. The mask has to be simple or at least easily reproducible.
3) The random nature of a private key does indeed prevent statistical analysis, however it's *not* "as secure" as a one time pad is, because the "result" is verifiable. Of course this is meaningless in practice.
Regardless, this "method" could be sound. It solely depends on the quality of the steps in the procedure.
Some things that could weaken this "method":
1) "Excessive" re-use of the method.
2) "Leaked" or "known" plaintext - ciphertext pairs. I could see that OP was reluctant in providing the Address for this wallet. Could be that it is contained in the image as well.
3) "Active" attacks. What if I came to OPs home and replaced this image with something else? Let him run his procedure on my ciphertext at some point without realizing it?
Anyway, if the OP understands the above (and it seems that way), I'd wager that his coins aren't going to be compromised any time soon.

This algo uses scrypt. It is intentionally very hard to compute. No only is it cpu intensive, it also requires lots of RAM (tens of MBs or more). This makes a brute forcer really hard to scale. 
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:38:03
It's very rudimentary, definitely not "publishable". Regardless, I'll see what I can do.

Same was in Israel until lately. Only now there are a couple of local exchanges. Low volume and hard to trust, but its something.
