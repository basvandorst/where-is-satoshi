his qr code
someone sent him 0.001337 BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:24:31
i remember people tipping 1BTC (though i mostly remember .1 BTC) here and I bet a lot of people never claimed them
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:06:03
real bitcoin pros are still living with mummy playing the long hodl game
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:52:15
yeah i sold about 15% of my bitcoin when it peaked a few days ago or whenever, but i would never sell all of them 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:17:38
oh no i dont at all, i don't live with mummy but if i did and had a few bitcoin i'd bide my time
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:57:28
Not sure how that worked or if that tip bot  still exists but it was wildly popular for a while
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:42:13
all that time i wasted on the internet would have finally paid off
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:05:05
Still early 
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:15:14
this is actually a horrible idea and would take forever
@_date: 2014-09-23 02:45:22
RemindMe! 10 years
Hopefully I'm not dead.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:47:38
I spent .5 bitcoins alone so I believe it
First bitcoin I've spent since buying in September.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:07:39
he's not my brah
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:23:45
Haha I had to see if anyone else got one too. They are trying to charge me $408 that I already paid in bitcoin.  I'm sure it's just an error though.
@_date: 2014-10-11 00:40:45
no entiendo
@_date: 2014-04-21 04:51:25
found his alt
@_date: 2014-04-21 05:38:14
Yeah it was a joke because he's one of the few people defending you in here. I don't spend much time here these days so I couldn't care less what you did to piss everyone off. I just came here for the drama.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:23:37
In other news my purchase when through easily and I've already received my order. 
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:50:08
Fair enough, just never enough that would hurt :)
@_date: 2016-06-12 03:02:26
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:42:00
Who the hell keeps coins in Coinbase anyway? I buy and cash it out immediately. I don't trust any websites holding my btc you never know when they'll be seized.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:47:52
That's the only reason I have it and I'm up over 400% and rising... just seems like a safe investment, digital currency. The world is going more and more digital each day so I don't see it going anywhere but up.
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:58:52
Me too, but mid 2017 seems too soon unless the media spams it for weeks. I don't see it going up to $5500 in just 6 months.
@_date: 2016-12-27 21:36:45
here's a good guide
@_date: 2015-07-04 14:49:53
shut up man he's 17 
@_date: 2016-10-09 18:34:09




@_date: 2017-05-02 01:58:30
how convenient to leave that out... this post is trash, "she" probably got caught selling
@_date: 2015-10-10 23:33:05


Nice try, I upvoted you both.
@_date: 2017-05-12 01:20:27
I'll stick with my piece of paper.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:33:33
yep, holding til then
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:21:54
he is crazy enough to do it though, dude is wanted for murder and eating shit im pretty sure
@_date: 2018-12-16 15:06:31
ah yeah that price bought me a living room set
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:54:35
pff old -&gt; $442
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:29:32
Feels good to be back.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:03:01
How does it feel to be rich?
@_date: 2013-10-30 23:35:20
You look dashing. Great interview.

They shut down full tilt poker and still have some people's money. They won't go after the individual but if you leave any amount of money in there and they decide to shut down the site then it might be hard to get back.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:57:23
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:54:41
Dis gone be good
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:38:21
Probably the same dude that posted this thread.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:42:40
Well you certainly aren't incorrect. I'm not sure how the market was back then personally.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:03:43
Thank you, I'm bad at time zones apparently.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:57:46
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:45:02
Not a fan of the dollar background since bitcoin is international. Other than that it is great.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:53:01
Ah okay thanks 1 hour from this post then.
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:26:28
I bought 1 bitcoin from coinbase today after reading the post on the front page, I hope it was worth it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:24:39
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:40:57
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:04:13
Coinbase takes days to perform a transaction so therefore it's not good for quick day trading.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:42:16
I wasn't selling massive amounts, only $100 worth.  I'm not giving up on bitcoin in the least. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:51:22
Yeah sorry bout that..I left too.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:58:18

Link should be good, but either one looks fine.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:01:34
started now!
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:09:01
I'm not sure how it works, haven't been tipped yet. I think it is an awesome function though.
@_date: 2013-10-31 04:01:01
Awesome thanks man!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:36:23
No way it's going to 90. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:00:05
Are you also a Nigerian prince?
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:30:18
I can tell you one for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:36:35
How much BTC have you given out with this?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:12:56
Watching it now and it's fluctuating like crazy. (bitcoinity)
-$50 in about 5 minutes (back up now, getting interesting)
IRC channel for live chat 
Unfortunately it's full of idiots, but a live chat nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:19:43
i believe we have an IRC channel somewhere. Found it.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:38:19
I've tried two days in a row to sell on coinbase and it will say pending.. check back the next day and it is like i did nothing.  Think I'm done with them. 
edit: I'm also unable to send money to my other accout so I'm pretty boned at the moment.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:17:38
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:24:30
IRC channel!
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:56:45
Well their next program isn't til 9pm, so who knows how long this one will last.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:09:59
Nice explanation my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:23:46
Saw this right after I bought in. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:21:50
Let us know how rich you are.
