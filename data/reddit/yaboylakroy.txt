I think most people will recommend holding bitcoin VS flipping it. if you go into it trying to flip for profit you might have stressful time. 
Part of the point with bitcoin is to move away from fiat currency. (fiat means money supplied by your government, not the car)

more like, keep bitcoin saved for when the economy collapses and the dollar is useless. just my opinion, there are plenty of people who try to profit off it but either way youre still going to hold it long term.

noticed this when i first got into BTC. and yes, as a newbie i was confused and almost didn’t want to get involved until i went to twitter and learned more. 
Patience and DYOR.

Cash App is mobile only yes. You may want to consider a smart phone if you plan on getting into a digital currency. 
The other option would be exchanges like Coinbase,  but i read that they recently fell victim to an attack. 
there’s also Bitfinex and Bitstamp. I have no experience with any of these so def read as much as you can and do your best research.

of course! as far as wallets go, look into Wasabi Wallet, no smartphone needed and they offer some pretty cool features. 
welcome to the rabbit hole, friend.

if you’re in the US, Cash App is a great way to onboard into bitcoin (BTC, the real bitcoin) and you can eventually withdraw it into a wallet of your choice as you do your own research.
