Ouch, that's a rough deal on that share purchase for the acquisition...
But I couldn't agree more with your last statement. If you define your happiness and quality of life by how much money you have, you'll never be happy. 
I've proven this to myself several times. I've gone through some big gains and massive losses in investments, but as I look back on those times, I realize that my actual happiness in my life did not correlate with the financial ups and downs, but instead depended entirely on the quality of my life in terms of personal relationships and experiences. Sure, all else being equal, more money helps, but it's just the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.

I know exactly how this feels. I was 20 years old when I took over managing my own investments. Went heavily into TASR stock starting around 2002 or 2003. Turned $10 into $350k. Back down to $50k. Doubled down and got it back to $350k. Then took all that out and put it into a company nobody ever heard of, Raser (ticker RZ, figured it rhymed with Taser so it had to be another home run investment in the making). 
In a few months, my RZ stock spiked up and, for just a few hours, I was a 22 year old college student with $1,000,000 in my Etrade account. I thought, "Should I sell? Or what if this is just the beginning of the real run up, like I experienced with TASR? If I sell, I'll owe ~$400k in short term capital gains taxes. Plus, I'm smart, obviously. Let's turn this $1M into $10M and retire!". 
By the end of that day, the stock was already back down about 30-40% from it's intra-day high. But that was okay, that meant I still had about $600k. Long story short, two years later it was worth $10k. A year after that, $0. 
I'll never stop laughing at what an arrogant idiot I was back then. But you live and you learn.
