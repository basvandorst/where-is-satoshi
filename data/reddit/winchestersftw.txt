I wish they would accept other currencies, I don't want to hold Bcash just for the once a month possibility of getting to order one...

In the US?

Tastee Wheatcoin is a hardfork of wheatcoin, it's the next big thing.

I can't resist trading a little bit here and there for the small gains (in BTC, not $). When I'm busy at work I forget about it though. So far it works out either way.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:13:15
What do you like about LTC? I thought about grabbing some at $200 last night, glad I didn't, but still considering it.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:59:46
Thanks for the reassurance.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:17:19
I wish you could pay with Bitcoin, I would have one now. Wasn't able to convert to their preferred shitcoin fast enough when they became available.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:51:27
So what's stopping people from plugging in 12-24 random words as fast as they can forever and possibly swiping people's coins?
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:19:23
Monero anyone?
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:46:27
There's got to be a way around this.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:15:36
I think the complexity of keeping coins secure and also using them is going to be a large barrier to adoption. For every review that says something is good, some other review says that wallet or exchange is scamming people. It's not a good look.
People don't have to think very hard about cash, whereas with bitcoin you have to be VERY security conscious. This worries me, but not enough to sell or give up on it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:48:39
I bought in 2014 right before the long crash and lost track of my wallet. Last November was fun when I figured out how to get my wallet back online. January has been less fun so far, but I don't think Bitcoin is going anywhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:32:12
Does it do privacy or fungibility?
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:12:37
I'm an amateur, so please don't take this as FUD. Could a system not be designed to try millions of combinations daily or hourly? Wouldn't that eventually work, and even if it works once a month it would be "worth it" for the thief?

On Preston by any chance?
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:55:32
Do you know what the price for the 821s will be? Is it a minimum purchase of 5?
@_date: 2018-01-24 04:32:10


I see what you did there.
As to the rest of your comment....WAT?!
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:32:06
That's a long time. It still bugs me that some asshat could just guess random words and possibly hit the jackpot with my money. Mathematically impossible though, so I shouldn't feel that way.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:38:53
Do they accept USD and BTC? Are they competitive in TH/s per $?
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:23:08
You can if you strap wheels and a battery to it! Paging u/elonmusk
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:42:12
Bitcoin, Monero, and?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:50:27
I got it, thank you. Wasn't much, but I had to use the same app (bcash version) to get it. 
Now I can use the bcash to buy btc while it's in this dip!
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:11:26
I had no idea puppy ownership had become so controversial until I stuck my nose in these comments. Yikes
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:42
Aww shucks... the price showed $9500 on GDAX lol, I was hoping to get in on that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:28:15
OK. It's actually in a .dat file called "bitcoin-wallet-keys" genius I know, but I never thought it would matter.
Do I need to use a specific wallet for BCASH? And are there any that are compatible with my olllllld keys?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:11:00
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:55:27
I can't find an option to create one within freewallet
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:35:41
Historically, yes to all three.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:18:18
I used WinMD5free...maybe that's the problem?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:03
You sold at $.30?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:34:05
You seem wise, I'm nervous about my freewallet now, what's the safest way to put my bits into a paper wallet from freewallet? Can I make a paper wallet without a TX fee? I plan to get a hardware wallet eventually, but figured paper is a good solution to get out of freewallet ASAP. I also downloaded mycelium, should I transfer it there to get it out? I hadn't really been active with Bitcoin since it crashed in 2014, still feel like a noob as far as security goes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:46:43
Thanks I'll try that
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:44:34
Oh I'm sorry, I meant the electron-cash wallet won't accept the file with the keys in it. Is there a way to convert old .dat files into a more practical one? I'm terrible at this, I must be getting old, I never used to have issues figuring this stuff out on my own. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:43:47
Is monero a viable solution to that problem? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:32:36
It won't let me import the file directly. It doesn't seem to recognize it
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:25:52
I have all my Bitcoin in a freewallet... Can I make a paper wallet directly from the app? This has me worried, the app keeps crashing too...
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:04:10
I wish I had read this a week and a half ago...$75 in fees. Oh well.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:46:08
One of many I'm sure. Just HODL. If buying in 2014 and forgetting about it taught me anything, it's that watching the price day to day is stressful, forgetting about it is profitable.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:21:28
I sold in late August, is that before the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:23:53
That's the hash shown on github, my Electron starts with CC6CB?

I'm looking on GDAX...I think there's some error, when I put to trade BCH for BTC, it says I will receive 3x the BTC of the BCH that I want to trade...how could that be? Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.
Either way, happy to have ignored it until now, excited to get free money.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:12:17
It seems like it's a little harder to use, with the tiny buttons on the sides. Any thoughts about that?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:03:53
That paper wallet business with offline sounds complicated. I've read about the Ledger Nano S and the Trezor. I'm interested in buying Monero as well, but neither of them support it so far. Do you have a preference between the Nano and the Trezor? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:17:52
Congrats on the job and on the beautiful gesture, I hope your Mom feels better and has a Happy Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:53:27
What do I do if the checksums don't match...
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:30:32
I bought again today. I bought in 2014 right before it dropped for a very very long time. Sold again when it hit $5000. Just bought again at $16000ish, and feel like a fool for ever selling. 
I think there may be other, superior coins that emerge, but Bitcoin is the biggest name and will always be a player.
Plus I can't buy Monero on coinbase.
Barring unforeseen emergencies that eat up my safety net I plan to HODL the door now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:53
What does post only mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:45:20
I can't tell what's going on here. Screen broken. EXPLN?&gt;
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:46:44
Thank you sir, that's the app I needed to recover my wallet. Hurray!
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:00:07
You're right. The biggest thing holding bitcoin back is that you have to read and study to understand how to even use it. With normal currency you just count it, spend it, store it, whatever, and generally it's pretty stable (USD, Euro).
I feel your pain. There's a lot of potential, but it has to get to the point that the elderly can use it without getting scammed before it will supplant fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:49:59
What is HODL
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:05:59
I don't know how yet. I'm now deciding what to do with the $500 in loose change I just dug out of my hard drive. Cash out, or I may move it all into Altcoins just to hope I get lucky and pick a good one.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:57:56
I bought some in 2014, and I'm doing a great job not spending them because they're in a file that I can't seem to recover them from. 
Been trying to figure out how to unlock/recover this for a while, but I'm afraid I'll get ripped off following people's advice. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:06:32
Thanks guys. I guess I was overthinking it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:20:51
Same dammit coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:19:11
Damn you coinbase for disabling my buys and reenabling once it hits an all-time high.
@_date: 2018-11-11 20:40:15
Wait for the new Tesla Roadster, by the time it comes out you might be able to buy one with a few bitcoins, or all of them. Either way you could be saving for one of the coolest cars in history, assuming it is built and lives up to the promises.

@_date: 2019-01-07 18:47:43
The government can seize your coins if they have been used in illicit transactions, even if you obtained them legally. They can track that, so it's not actually fungible.
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:52:36
It's not fungible or private.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:14:11
Do you just sit with someone while you wait for the transaction? I've wondered how to do this safely.
@_date: 2019-01-08 05:05:56
Yes USD have serial numbers.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:22:47
I sold at $4500. 
Just deciding if and when to get back in.
