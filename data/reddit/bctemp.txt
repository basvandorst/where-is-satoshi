About a week. I have a remote backup from a month back that I am putting the users on in the interim. Trying to recover the recent data by going the BTC route.

My concern is exactly what you mentioned. I will likely PM you once I scan the environment and make sure I have a good backup. I don't want to unlock the data and have the encryption roll back into the server.

I tried Kaspersky's cryptoware keygen but the wallet address did not match any known key.

It's a very strange situation. We use Ninite at our shop mostly for setting up new pc's to save time. Once deployed we manage via SolarWinds/N-Able or Active Directory. 
What makes this situation annoying is that it is an old client we stopped working with (they broke contract). They had some legacy AV software and some half-running backups that we no longer manage because they were bought out by another company with an in-house IT department. The parent company never bothered updating or implementing new solutions so we're stuck with whatever backups and solutions we had in place before they dumped us. 
Now they're crawling back begging for help because the company is sidelined. I restored my old backup but I'm gonna have to bite the bullet and get this crypto key via BTC I guess. Luckily today is Friday so I can finish this project over the weekend.

Maybe you didn't read the portion that said 'potential client'. I wouldn't hire you either on account that you can't read. The only backups I had are theirs.
