Thanks. I'll keep hoping for the best and reading up more. I appreciate all the effort you've put into explaining it to me. I confess that I still can't wrap my head around it and feel confident in it, but hopefully that will change soon.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:16:34
yea, it was stupid to call it a ponzi, but I think some people say ponzi when they really mean scam.

Bitcoin is socialist? I thought it was about individual liberty and empowerment.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:43:30
Completely agree on that point. I think it's very likely. I'm not sure it would be that bad in the long run though - it will give crypto a chance to reconsider which projects are worthwhile and which are not.

If LA didn't expand their traffic capacity as the city population increased overtime, traffic would increase and population growth would slow down. People would live somewhere else...
So not "no one drives" just "fewer people drive".
Fewer users is bad for a currency. Or is bitcoin not a currency anymore?

How big do you think are the risks of a successful attack or a technical failure of the lightning network?
In theory any technical system can fail (even the blockchain itself may fail in an unexpected way, even if it's worked so far).
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:24:50
I see that they forked, and I see how it's profitable. I don't see how it's a scam though. Could you actually explain that part?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:43:01
My understanding is that it's called Bitcoin Cash because it's a minority fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. What actually makes it a scam? Did I miss something?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:15:38
"It's more spendable than any of those"
I agree! That's why I like BTC. It is good money. It sounds like you agree that spendability is important?
Now all we need to do is make sure it stays at the front of the pack as a money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:23:10
Would you ever support a minority fork that used the bitcoin brand? 
Or would you always follow the majority fork and consider any fork that used the bitcoin brand to be a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:32:50
Thanks. Do you think best second layer solution has yet to be hashed out? How confident are you that second layer solutions will function effectively (retain the same useful properties as bitcoin like decentralization and censorship resistance)?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:27:10
I'm glad that in any case bitcoin is flexible enough that one solution or another should work and we'll have a functional crypto that can help people achieve financial freedom.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:04:42
Who has lost money due to the "misnomer"?
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:37:43
Another question: if I understood correctly, outside of lightening the other efforts are around making transactions smaller, which I imagine has finite benefit (correct me if I'm wrong). Are there any other "big" scaling options in the works, or just lightening?
If lightening fails to work as hoped, is there any other option to reach global scale?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:59:54
My understanding was that it's a fork from the original bitcoin blockchain, so it uses Satoshi's genesis block. Since it's a bitcoin fork,  it uses bitcoin in the name. I don't follow your logic yet, perhaps you could explain in more detail?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:53:41
Thanks, I see that it's not implemented in core or at some exchanges. Why do you think that is?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:23:32
Perhaps if it was universally called Bitcoin Cash, people would have more readily understood what the fork was about and held their coins. In that way, any label other than "Bitcoin Cash" could be quite confusing and harmful, since it's not the official name of the fork / project.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:21:16
If people skip from one blockchain to the next so easily, the will also leave Eth and Iota. The network effect is very powerful. Bitcoin, or a fork of bitcoin, is likely to succeed.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:45:16
You disagree with Satoshi on that point I guess?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:30:32
I agree with the part about shitty math haha!
With the same logic, you could say "if you started the year with $1k, and bitcoin went up to get you to 1,000,000 then all it takes is 4% drop to erase $4k. That's the equivalent of 400% gains on your original $1k, so 4% loss = 400% gain!!!"
Of course all of that is really based on the arbitrary selection of the annual price increase. Likewise if you select a timeframe when bitcoin went down, then you could say that 4% gain is equal to 40% loss.
tl;dr    40% is not equivalent to 400% (unless you multiply it by 10!)
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:25:32
Yea it's awesome. I hope bitcoin can continue to improve its "spendability" lest it be overtaken by competitors / substitutes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:09:04
It's a minority fork of the bitcoin blockchain. It has a higher blocksize limit, which allows more transactions and lower fees. It's controversial because some believe the larger blocksize will cause centralization of record keeping in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:12:51
If one party is uncooperative, how is it resolved? What is the settlement mechanism in that case
Also how would I know which channels are safe and which channels are not, or is there some way to ensure that all channels are guaranteed to be safe?
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:41:40
Thanks I really appreciate all the detail. 
Are payments on lightening network trustless, like on chain transactions? I don't (yet) see how a mesh network could achieve trustless transactions without a proof of work mechanism like bitcoin has on chain, if that even is the goal.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:26:31
I'm just not following you. Perhaps you could give me some more detail?
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:59:01
You'd spend Bitcoin if the expected benefit from the purchase exceeds expected benefit from the return on investment if you keep it invested in Bitcoin.
That's the same reason anyone would ever spend money, instead of investing it.
The higher the expected return available in the market, the greater is the incentive to invest your assets rather than consume. None of that changes depending on which asset you hold value in today, since you always have both options: invest in a high yield asset, or spend on consumption goods.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:47:35
Remember if bitcoin dips again... use your best judgement to balance the risks in your portfolio. You **can** lose long term if you hold. Be aware of the risks and manage your assets accordingly.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:51:25
I agree with you when you're say that it's a hard fork, everyone got bitcoin cash, it didn't have a new genesis block (just the original one), but I don't see how that's related to being a scam.
Why do those things make it a scam?
To me, what you've said would be like saying "bitcoin is a scam because it is digital and it's not sanctioned by the government". Those things are true, but bitcoin is still not a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:46:57
I genuinely would like to know why it's a scam. I'd appreciate if you could tell me, but so far you've just repeated over and over that it's a scam, which hasn't helped me figure out what you're seeing that I'm missing.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:45:10
I hope it works well! If so, that would definitely allow for Bitcoin to stay ahead of the curve.
How confident are you that lightening will turn out as well as is hoped?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:58:11
Makes sense, thanks. So far it seems like:
1) limited on chain scaling via improved tech for recording transactions (reducing cost of storage, compute etc)
2) limited on chain scaling via increased block size (contingent on the changing requirements and changing cost of storage, compute, etc)
3) lightning network as a second layer solution
You said "off chain systems like Lightning". Are there other promising off chain systems besides lightening?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:53:31
The only difference between a scam and a legit product is the functionality of the thing you're selling. If it's useful above and beyond what you pay for it, it's legitimate. If it's not useful, then it's a scam.
It's possible (but not true, in my opinion) that only one coin has any utility / functionality.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:36:56
It's not the noobs that are buying Bitcoin Cash. It's mostly veterans. Noobs buy what they see on TV, just regular "Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:42:00
It's unfortunate that bitcoin no longer works well as money. Hopefully it can regain that functionality quickly, lest it be replaced by another fork like bitcoin cash, or worse by an altcoin
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:53:53
Duct tape is very useful. It solves a lot of problems ever day.

If they are negative on BCH they are usually allowed because the mods are against BCH
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:57:26
I'm a big supporter of Bitcoin Cash since it provides an alternative to Core. However I'll be the first one to say that if the lightning network arrives and works as advertised, I will be very very happy. I'd refocus almost entirely on Bitcoin Core with a big smile on my face.
I wish it existed already!
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:10:51
Its not bad. It's quite good.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:37:27
Are spam attacks thought to a legitimate thing? If so why?
It seems counter-intuitive that people would throw away money just so other people have to spend a little more on fees. It's a tremendously expensive and inefficient attack. It seems even more far fetched when there is a perfectly reasonable explanation - high usage.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:43:30
What if a second fork occurs and the majority fork is running code with changes you don't like. Which side of the fork would you follow?
Would you follow the majority fork every time? Or the fork with the code you prefer every time? Or does it depend?
Edit: ...crickets from op
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:39:49
It disenfranchises Bitcoin holders, while bitcoin cash did not.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:04:28
Would you be against all forks, or just this one?
In your analogy, the "copycat" seems bad. What if the majority started running bad code, would you still want to follow the majority, or is there any case in which you would prefer a fork?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:39:32
I agree that spam seems like an extremely inefficient attack vector. It hardly matters AND it costs money. It seems more likely that "spam" is a scapegoat for high fees.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:48:53
Thanks. Watching the video and trying to understand better.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:39:14
Litecoin disenfranchises Bitcoin holders while bitcoin cash did not. And that's on top of the fact that infrastructure costs of switching to an altcoins are higher than using a minority fork.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:23:31
Wat... That's not true
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:47
I'm not saying it's impossible that an Alt succeeds long term but there are factors counting against it.
1) The network effect for currency is stronger than for other technologies like messaging, because people use it and store value on it, instead of just use it.
2) The ability to fork means that bitcoin can evolve and change in an open source way, unlike AOL or a centralized service. Any one can launch a new coin and still preserve much of the network effect of bitcoin by forking, rather than starting from scratch.
It's an interesting market though... I certainly don't know how it will play out
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:49:18
Thanks. Sounds promising, but also difficult to understand. I hope side chains are a success, since they could really pave the way to all kinds of innovations.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:20:04
Thanks for sharing.
I see how the address format might cause accidents. It seems to make sense to push for the new Bitcoin Cash address format that you see on Bitpay's Copay app, for example.
I don't see where the naming convention of Bitcoin Cash caused any lost funds though. Non of the suggested solutions in the article had anything to do with the naming convention. Perhaps there were examples I missed; could someone point me to them?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:40:18
I'd be glad to see the proof. Would you point me to it? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:12:19

Why wouldn't it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:52:49
I contest whether or not 2 layer solutions will eventually be needed to be built into bitcoin. I see bitcoin as a settlement layer in the long run, which can serve its purpose with on chain transactions if technology grows sufficiently fast. (yes there will be trusted 2nd layer solutions, which there already are today)
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:47:33
Since the computer requirements will still be pretty low at 2MB blocks, that must mean the risk from centralization from that change is very low?
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:50:28
I want 2x.
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:20:59
Yea, I support it. It would help alleviate network congestion, which is much needed judging by the crazy fee levels.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:51:25
technically true... but in my case, the x is a pretty high number!
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:32:32

what would cause a division later this year?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:44:40
If the size isn't important - why doesn't core just fork to 2MB, which seems to be a move that the community wants.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:53:14
How are they trying to do that?
My understanding is that the minority fork is known as "bitcoin cash", a minority fork of the original bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:00:14
You're right, since gold doesn't hash, it would take a much bigger price move from BTC to gold before the bitcoin network froze up, but the network would lock if the price fell enough regardless of where the money was flowing to.
I'm a pretty free market guy, so in my book, as long as there is no coercion going on and all they are doing is trying to convince people, then it's ok, even if they are shitting on the assets I like (e.g. BTC, BCH, Stocks). Do you see it differently?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:18:44
But they are a bitcoin fork...
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:42:41
That would help the fee market clear more efficiently. 
It's still supply and demand that sets the price; if the market clearing price for being included in the next block is $2, no algorithm or interface will change that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:30:16
I've personally been using the app for months and there is no confusion as a user. Two separate, accurately labeled wallets are created by default. BTC is the default wallet, with BCH as an alternate.
I recommend the app.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:17:37
No, not for "low" volume at least
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:52:16
I'm against the "use bitcoin for coffee" if it would create too much centralization, but even as a settlement layer we'll require fees to stay relatively (&lt;$5) low to compete with alternatives. If demand continues to rise, fees will exceed that.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:34:04
I'd find that acceptable, if the fee were to be &lt;$5 and we were able to scale to global levels. Bitcoin is pretty tiny (relatively) today though and we're already seeing &gt;$5 transaction fees. Is that just a result of off chain solutions taking too long to be implemented?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:50:21
I'm an absolute madman!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:29:08
I'm not sure how political the wallet is being, simply by offering support for Bitcoin's minority fork. Even those who want to dump their minority fork coins, would need to use a wallet like this one to do so.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:44:22
when you say the tech will improve, what do you mean? like hardware tech will improve such that we can increase the on chain transaction throughput?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:26:33
If that were true, equities, or gold, or many other alternatives would suffice. Bitcoin is unique because it's a superior money. Money requires "spendability"
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:06:16
I didn't know that Bitcoin Cash was marketed as the only Bitcoin? Would you point me to where that's happening, since I'd be interested in seeing it.
My understanding was that it's presented as "bitcoin cash", a minority fork of the original bitcoin. I think that's a fair, not confusing, way to present things.
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:32:35
Is that going to increase the storage cost of blocks?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:04:24
OK yea that's fair, you are right. You are treating the wallet and the situation fairly, even if I disagree on Roger's agenda and character. I was barking up the wrong tree.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:17:35
I thought the inclusion of replay protection was explicitly meant to *prevent* hijacking the legacy chain?
I'm not sure how I follow how they are the aggressors in this situation (e.g. vote brigading on the bitcoin.com app)
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:14:54
technically true, since both are steady right now
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:06:31
You probably SHOULD consider it. I'd always consider all related alternatives before making any investment.
The basic trade off between BTC and BCH is related on scaling:
Core believes that bitcoin can't scale on chain the long run due to storage and bandwidth limitations, so 2nd layer transactions are necessary. They maintain a low cap on blocksize so that nodes are very low cost to run, and then are working on 2nd layer solutions, which we hope arrive soon and are effective.
Cash supporters believe that on chain scaling is definitely possible in the short term, and maybe in the long term, so they have increased the tx limit and block size. This increases the cost of running a node, but allows more, cheaper transactions. Their bet is that storage and bandwidth and on chain tech improvement will keep up with demand long enough so that on chain transactions are a viable long term solution.
Depending on how you see those issues, you may fall on one side or the other. It's worth considering, regardless of your final conclusion.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:32:10
Are you saying that the low volume is the only reason they have lower transaction fees than bitcoin, or just a contributing reason?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:14:36
what makes the wallet a scam?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:03
Is it really co-opting the brand if it's an actual fork of the bitcoin blockchain?
As long as hodlers receive a fair distribution via hard fork, it seems fair to call it some name like "bitcoin cash", since it is a fork of the original bitcoin chain.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:20:16
let's see, I'll check on my phone...
answer: it shows a Bitcoin Core address, appropriately labeled as such
**edit:** ok since I'm being downvoted, here's a screenshot of when I click on "receive":

Sorry for the confusion; I'm sure it's hard to tell what's genuine and what's not, in this context.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:57:50
Thanks, I've found some articles along those lines. In his view I guess Bitcoin Cash represents the correct vision of bitcoin.
Fortunately the market moves on price, not articles, and any significant shift would only happen if there is actual merit behind the ideas, right? It seems that the articles at least do clearly show that there are multiple forks, and that it's up to users to decide which to buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:38:55
Doesn't everyone always try to convince people to buy the assets they hold and sell the ones they don't? (e.g. BTC, BCH, alt-coins, USD, stocks, gold.... )
The gold bugs all say you should sell BTC and buy gold; does that make them aggressors too?
They are entitled to their own opinion, and it won't change anything unless the market decides they are right, right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:46:25
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:14:20
Really? Most of the positive reviews (including the one I wrote) seemed to be from people who actually used the app, whereas most of the negative reviews didn't discuss the actual functionality of the wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:27:40
Both a BTC and a BCH wallet are created by default. The BTC wallet is the default, of the two. That's clear in the app. It's not clear in the posts by those who are threatened by the app's support for BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:13:22
The way I see it, all forks of bitcoin are relevant, so it would be unwise to ignore them. It does seem that the best mechanism for measuring consensus is the economic majority though. A huge huge reason the 2x fork was called off was due to the price signalling that happens on markets between the two forks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:18:53
What is scammy about the website? I haven't seen or heard of a single scam related to the site.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:50:18
In order to maintain position as  crypto bitcoin needs to be competitive against even the best alternatives. Some alternatives offer transparent fees that are still lower than bitcoin's $2.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:38:39
What would be the alternative? If I want my transaction included, I have to outbid other people who want the same.
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:50:04
Is Roger political or is the wallet political?
I can see how you might dislike Roger if his support for the minority fork is thought to be detrimental to Bitcoin, but the wallet itself is a fine product.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:20:09
Roger be like "let's let the car drive more than 10 MPH, since current technology can handle it"
Haters be like "A 10 mph limit must be maintained. You can't get everyone places by just going faster and faster, since everyone would eventually crash. Instead we need a ride sharing network and a public transit layer. We're working on it. Until then, sorry about the traffic..."
@_date: 2017-10-02 05:50:54
Ledger was great with supporting the Bitcoin Cash fork and Segwit, so I trust them to do a good job supporting options for the upcoming fork, as they said they would.
@_date: 2017-09-12 02:01:52
Yea, I'd take 25%. 
but I'd ask if I could take it in Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:08:33
I'm also curious about question - what is the primary evidence that users / the economic majority will prefer to hold 1mb rather than 2x?
I don't personally have any information or conviction on which side of the fork most money will flow to, but I'd be really glad to be pointed to more information from someone I trust, like you.
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:40:10
bitcoin forked on August 1 into two versions. Bitcoin Cash is the minority fork, and the value has fallen to ~1/14th of the price of Bitcoin (Core).
Of the two sides of the fork, Bitcoin "Core" is referred to just as "Bitcoin" since it has the economic majority behind it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:22:13
Thanks for the replies - I guess I'll just keep holding my coins and selling any forks that I think have less value, to keep the economic incentives working.
I share your optimism bitcoin will survive and continue to be useful to us!
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:36:47
isn't bitcoin resistant to hijacking? if not, what makes it vulnerable?
if it's vulnerable to hijacking, why is it valuable?
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:23:01
I see, so you'd say it is potentially vulnerable to hijacking from a centralized mining network.
Is there a mechanism to prevent this attack? What is that mechanism (if it exists)? 
hard fork, economic incentives, something else?
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:28:45
Thanks dooglus, this has helped me understand the situation better, and I appreciate your time.
Is a 2mb blocksize itself a significant problem, or is it the myriad of reasons you listed above that make it a problem (hardfork, contentious nature, agreement by a small group, and the potential community acceptance of an arbitrary decree by business interests). In other words if the original blocksize cap had been set at 2mb instead of 1mb, would it be a problem - or would maintaining a 2mb status quo be acceptable under those circumstances (meaning no hardfork, no controversy, no business interests behind closed doors, etc etc)?
I think I follow your opinion on Bitcoin Cash - it's just another Alt and didn't do anything to help BTC, since the big blockers are still focused on messing with bitcoin, instead of sticking to their alt chain.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:01:02
That all makes sense. Thank you very much - I often have had trouble engaging in dialogue on both sides because there is a lot of frustration.
I'll go roll a few dice in your honor!
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:44:45
Thanks for all this info. I'm fairly naive, but I love gathering information from more knowledgeable people and I will stay tuned with great interest as it all shakes out in coming months.
Until then, I'll just keep hodling my coins... and my clams :)
I guess the beauty of crypto is that even if the economic majority is WRONG, we will still always have the option of using and following only the forks / projects / coins we believe are valuable. Although it's sad to see the market waste resources with short term misallocation of capital (e.g. an altcoin being labeled bitcoin and attracting capital and hashpower), we can still protect ourselves and be rewarded for intelligent investing in the long run.

You do control your own private keys, so ultimately you can move your coins any way you want.
Ledger creates software that works with their hardware to make managing your coins much easier. Their software gets updated to handle situations like hard forks, so that users can easily manage their coins on both sides of a fork.

Hey doog, I'm a big fan of your contributions to the bitcoin community, so I have a lot of respect for you. I'd really be interested in hearing more of your opinions on the different forks of bitcoin.
What's the primary problem with forking to 2x, as an idea?
What's the primary problem with the currently planned 2x hardfork?
If after a reasonable amount of time post-fork has passed, 2x were to have &gt;90% market share and hash power behind it, would you consider the 2x fork to be "bitcoin"? If not, why not?
Lastly, were you glad to see Bitcoin Cash fork off so that big block supporters could have what they want on an alt chain and Bitcoin core could forget about them and move on?
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:36:09
It's clear that many people disagree on how bitcoin is defined. Disagreement on that definition doesn't constitute fraud.
If it did, Peter might be committing fraud by claiming Bitcoin-Segwit1 coins are "Bitcoin" while Bitcoin 2X are not.
Of course neither side is committing fraud. Both sides are simply expressing their view on what bitcoin is and using their own resources to support that vision.

Maybe I shouldn't, but I do anyway!
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:46:04
thanks :) he's back on track now. looking forward to hearing more.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:11:13
thanks for the detailed explanation, that helps
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:00:19
OK! I'll send you 0.002 BTC (post fork) in exchange for all your BCC (post fork - and let's set a minimum of 1.0)
I'm not sure why it would surprise you that I'd make this offer - perhaps I'm missing something. I'm happy to agree to it though!
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:12:14
interesting - would it be a success if another money that was closer to ideal than BTC were to gain massive adoption at bitcoin's expense?
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:22:50
OK, I guess your offer was just illustrative.
I'm not sure I have been able to get the point yet, but I'll take a stab. Perhaps the main idea was that no *significant* value would be placed on the BCC chain (because you assert that it is not fundamentally superior) and no one would be willing to pump the chain price simply for the sake of "supporting the fork" since it would come at great cost. I see how any rational actor would avoid placing any value on BCC as an attempt to support the fork due to the game theory (his attempt to drive up price is costly, even if a multilateral move might cause the BCC fork to have greater hashpower). In this way, the ONLY value that would be placed on the BCC fork would be based on the perceived chance of that fork being viable in the long term based on fundamentals (which may be negligible).
Have I understood correctly? If so then it seems the focus should remain on the fundamental side of the discussion since we may be in accord on how markets will behave given fundamental assumptions on the utility of each fork.
Side note: If you can get around to it, I'd really appreciate any BCC you can send my way just as a personal favor! I'd owe you one :)
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:41:53
It could definitely be interpreted that way, but I'm assuming his question was earnest. If he later chooses to dismiss me because of lack of experience, then I'll be disappointed then. Until that point, I'll assume the best, just as I hope he is assuming I am sincere as well.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:30:37
Thanks, that's very kind.
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:39:31
what does "BMC" stand for?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:06:38
A hardfork is great since it provides the market with options. If you don't like a given fork of bitcoin, don't use it!
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:38:20
got the first ✔
It makes sense, but I don't see how it relates to Bitcoin Cash or the scaling debate.
Read the second, but I didn't follow a few parts:
You state that using Bitcoin Cash would be irrational, but I don't see an explanation of why that is. I only see the question "where the value from bitcoin cash is expected to come from?"
I failed to understand - why it is that "no one can possibly gain from selling bitcoin cash." 
My understanding is that Bitcoin Cash has differences from Bitcoin Core. Do you think that no people place any value on those differences, or does some group's preference for the attributes of Bitcoin Cash still not imply any value of those tokens? (or is there something else I'm missing)
Will read the 3rd next. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:00:00
Why not maximize? (or is that still an option?)
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:22:40
I must be a sincere but lost person, since I think bitcoin cash is a great idea and I'm a skeptic of a segwit soft fork and small blocks. Can you help me understand? Genuine request - if I'm wrong, and I often am, I want to understand the situation better and change my view. Thanks!!!
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:30:59
I still have a lot to learn but this helped me a lot, thanks. I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:28:08
I see how the low fees make it a superior alternative to gold.
Still, when you say that the current TPS is "enough" do you mean enough to make bitcoin better than gold only? Or do you mean enough to maximize the value of bitcoin as a gold like asset?
If you mean the former, I agree. If you mean the latter, I'd be interested in learning how that was determined (some measure of the amount of high value transactions that may be made using bitcoin?)
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:52:59
Thanks I will read each of these and then come back with questions and/or requests for more.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:38:57
I think it's a good idea too. I often ask for someone to tell me what they know first before I explain something.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:38:10
I have a bachelors degree in economics with a concentration on finance and I work in the financial sector. I'm well read on monetary economics. Some favorite books are "The Theory of Money and Credit" and "Inflation and the Theory of Money"
I understand how our financial system works very well.
Thanks for engaging with me, I'm hoping to learn much!
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:06:06
Thanks, I think I'm getting it better.
So whether the blocksize limit was set at 1MB or 2 or 8 or 0.1 is not of particular importance. In any case it would have sufficient transaction capacity to fulfill the role of digital gold - the only impact would be on the margin affecting low value transaction capacity. So perhaps you would reject a blocksize that only allowed for 1 transaction per block because that would be extreme enough to affect the utility as a digital gold, but for any "normal" blocksize it's "fine".
That makes sense to me - I'd still like to learn more about how it can be determined what transaction capacity is necessary to support digital gold. What if it's actually 10 high value transactions per second rather than somewhere less than 3?
How do we know that it's "fine" the way it is?
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:21:58
It's a fork of bitcoin that will increase block size and won't have segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:04:31
I see, thanks. What's the deal with them? How does it in particular serve their interests?
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:45:11
I think that's an exaggeration, but perhaps there's a significant degree of truth! I'm here to learn what it is that I'm missing.
I'm not worried about the semantics like some of the others who responded to you. As long as you offer genuine facts and analysis that will deepen my understanding of the situation, I will be grateful.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:50:03
:) don't worry I only own $16 of ETH and it has gone down!
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:28:34
It took me a few weeks to sync. I'm not sure what a listening node is. I haven't noticed any impact to my bandwidth.
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:21:54
I think I'm a bit lost and may have to take a step back to better understand.
We like bitcoin because it serves as a superior alternative to gold. Do we care HOW much better than gold it is? What about how much better it is versus an alternative crypto?
Is it theoretically possible to have another crypto that's superior to bitcoin? (say very low storage cost with very high tx throughput all on a secure base layer)
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:30:43
Yea, I have a Bitcoin Unlimited node running on my dogshit windows laptop.
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:12:45
I read the third article as well and I agree with your rejection of the "bitcoin as a low value transaction tool". I think it would help to understand the rationale for where the right balance is between blockchain size and transaction throughput (if that is the proper trade off to be considering... if not see below).
Is there any marginal benefit to increasing or decreasing transaction throughput at any level? (e.g. reducing from 100 tx per block to 1 tx per block would presumably have some impact - or not?) If so - what is the benefit at the margin, and how is it measured?
What is the marginal cost (benefit) of a larger (smaller) blockchain?
As I read the article it seemed to say that "large blocks come at high cost and offer low benefit" which may be true. What I'd like to understand is how exactly we can determine the right balance - perhaps blocks should be much smaller even??
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:25:59
That's a great point - at some point it would seem very smart to make a hardfork with PoW change so that the economic majority can easily decide which side of the fork it prefers.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:15:48
So, if I understand correctly, a larger block size may be ok, or even necessary - but the more important issue is the ability to scale through LN?
Scaling off chain with LN, if I understand correctly, will allow people to make lots of fast low value transactions through LN nodes. What are the primary trade offs of using LN rather than making on chain transactions? (e.g. if we took it to the extreme and on chain capacity was only one transaction per block and all other transactions were done through LN, what would be the issues?)
I think understanding the answers to those questions may help me understand better overall. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:02:19
I hear you. I think that sounds about right too. &lt;$1 and &lt;200GB per year maybe(?) for now.
Not sure.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:48:56
I'm just like you, but I actually can imagine a 30 year old saying "segshit" etc. People behave different behind a keyboard.
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:23:58
How is that? Are the preventing a hard fork to greater capacity?
Isn't that impossible to due if you're not the majority, since the majority rules, by definition?
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:38:56
What do you think is the right equilibrium, right now?
