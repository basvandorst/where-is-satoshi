Bitcoin core is their term.  There is bitcoin.  And there is their bitcoin cash which they are trying to promote as the true heir to the bitcoin kingdom.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:18:17
Looks like a demon horse

Yeah we can all avoid paying tax... but have fun driving on dirt roads and no police or firemen when your house burns down and people are robing you.  And rape you in the butthole because there are no jails and the rapists are roaming the streets.    
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:57:39
how they pay for fire trucks and equipment and water and helicopter drops.  It’s ridiculous to think you don’t need taxes.  If you think like that go to Puerto Rico and see what it’s like with not taxes (cause the politicians are keeping all of it and not spending it on infrastructure etc).
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:20:47
I don’t get lightning network.  Isn’t the whole point of bitcoin that it is super secure.  It’s like we are taking transactions out of the super secure space and doing things.  Doesn’t that weaken the whole system?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:09
But less secure than blockchain.  An another note: Secure is all relative right.  Like I would say the $20 in my pocket is secure.  Or the money in my bank account by is secure.  I have zero insecurity about it.

Well the op was asking how to measure gains in satoshi so just answering his question
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:53:50
You can’t it’s frozen at that point.  Bch is in the 3000’s still on every other exchange
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:49:04
This one 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:18:47
Hehe, better than what I can do 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:08:53
If you can make money doing it, more power to you
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:52:46
No one new man it was insider trading plus a big fuckup
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:15:27
Final.  If you trade a sandshrew Pokémon card for a pikachu you don’t get taxed only when you sell your pikachu card.  Right??  That’s how I would think it works
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:49:20
What I mean is like imagine an RPG game where instead of Gil you have bitcoins or Bil or whatever the video game companies want to name them.  And instead of a treasure box you have a digital wallet and you have to hide your wallets here and there and stuff.  That way we can play with a lot of ideas and that idea of how things will work in bitcoin can things really grow organically from that
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:24:10
Dogecoin!! ��

Hahah wwbjd. New meme

Hey let’s go to the btc forum and gloat
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:16
Exactly so the weak point in the chain is anytime before you “close your channel” right?  Because those transactions are not entered into the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:53:09
I think after the asic farms will become huge nodes and will earn money by processing transactions and will take payment in bitcoins.  And they can charge whatever they want in a free market and people who want things processed faster can pay for it similar to fedexing a package.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:41:28
U mean fud?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:45:08
Ok yeah.  I was doing you have the profit you made in bitcoin and you wanted to know how much you made in satoshi.  Same problem different starting and end points
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:39:01
Everyone’s waiting to see what’s going to happen 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:17:22
Lost me at tulip
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:28:10
People were adopting much more quickly when it was mooning.  So much so that exchanges were broken.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:37:24
Y is this a scam or something
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:18:47
We can’t click and play it
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:40:48
Satoshi and bitcoin are the same coin so I don’t understand why you are asking about alts.    Just divide your usd gain in bitcoin by a million and it will tell you your gain in satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:15:00
It will make sense when we are on the moon!! ��   Not too early to start practicing now!  We can write a whole elementary school math book on calculating satoshi.   Start teaching them while they’re young!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:04:49
You must be one of those crypto guys
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:44:27
They will probably see what he bought if it was transferred to a known wallet.  It would be interesting if he bought a hooker or something
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:37:58
There isn’t only income taxes. There’s taxes when you buy a sandwich, a PlayStation, cigarette taxes Uber taxes .  And bullshit it’s paid for by volunteer labor.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:08:36
Wtf did I just spend 2 hours watching
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:11:41
Can someone translate that into layman’s terms?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:05:58
Oh a hundred million?  I think it’s still divide.  Because you are calculating the gain per satoshi right? Like converting gain per btc to gain per satoshi 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:37:28
Sorry I’m just learning this stuff.  How do you stress test this?
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:54:01
What does that mean?  Are they high frequency trading bitcoins or something?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:37
Because we don’t know what that is
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:53:39
How come?  Why would it be bad?  I honestly don’t know why.  I don’t know all the intricacies of Bitcoin but it seems like a solution if there is a bottleneck just widen the hole
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:54:26
how about 10000 to the moon memes
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:21:50

What’s ath 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:35:18
One thing I️ looked at in math a lot was exponential curves and that looks exactly the same
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:10:58
What’s fud 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:56:48
Does that mean I got banned
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:21:22
It will legitimize bitcoin so I think it will help it
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:47:05
It’s like saying ivory tusks are not legal.  They still 
Have their intrinsic value and may even boot it even more when they can’t shut it down
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:57:38
You want to start a band?
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:52:01
What does that mean
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:24:10
I’m not in it to make 10x or even 100x. My moon is no less than 1000x
@_date: 2019-12-05 05:56:10
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:28:34
Is this an ad
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:46:57
What does this do??
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:37:37
More blocks
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:22:49
Why not just have the same small blocks but more of them
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:44:42
 Is they will use them to mine themselves

You don’t. Bitcoin is like /t_d and btc is like /politics
