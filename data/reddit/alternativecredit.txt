Why would he waste his time on any kind of finance I’m sure he has people that do that for him.

A friend would advise you to do research on the investment or investing in general and make sure they understand the risks involved not just say invest in X.

Lambo=male inadequacy.

Who buys something in cash over 10,000 that’s not doing something sketch 
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:33:45
While I understand your point i don’t this as the same. Hitler would have never existed if the average person had 10,000 in cash to spend. He rose due to the lack of money and jobs available at the time and used that to blame a group of people as the the reason for the poor economy. Some what Similar to America with Mexico at the moment.

Yet you sell bitcoin for money you put in the bank so you can buy a lambo.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:48:18
Not really the same point at all but it’s all good I’m not worried about your opinion at this point.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:07:38
I’m sure it’s possible but that wasn’t really the point.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:07:49
I didn’t say anything about Bitcoin.

If someone tells their friend to invest in something specific they’re probably doing it for their own gain.
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:33:54
I’m sure someone said the same thing during the .com bubble,This doesn’t mean shit.
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:09:01
Did you just make this about hitler?
@_date: 2018-05-14 02:08:17
Good point.
@_date: 2018-10-31 01:05:17
Should totally pay for capital gains if you sell for usd or other currencies because your not using it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:52:57
The amount doesn’t matter... wow
@_date: 2018-10-06 12:18:52
Agreed but that’s not exactly the point you made. Diversifying is everything in investing and not to leave your self exposed to a single market or stock or currency investment.
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:42:05
Because icons are more important then a stable currency.

Until they allow it and everyone says how huge it will be.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:18:57
Yeah I don’t think he cares.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:54:51
So should I put my money in rubber ducks?
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:18:05
So buy Pokémon go
