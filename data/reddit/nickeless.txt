Yeah, but what's the point of bitcoin as long as fees are high and transaction volume is a barrier? There really isn't any imo. I'm hoping they fix those issues, though. Being tied to coinbase / gdax and having high fees and/or slow tx times makes it no better than the old banking system.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:26:45
Right, but it has been a major issue for years, which is the reason it worries me. If the dev team and miners actually moved toward fixing these issues in a somewhat timely fashion it would concern me far less, but the massive amount of hype about crypto and the fact that they are still moving like molasses on these, frankly, deal-breaking issues is not a good sign.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:27:02
Aslo transactions cost $5-15 :(. I'm hoping all these issues get remedied, but they are worrying.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:44:55
I guess I'm just worried about a bunch of people jumping on cryptos, then this issue becoming obvious, then having a massive price crash that turns a bunch of people off crypto for an extended period of time. I think it could delay mass adoption significantly.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:11:55
The problem is the network can't handle large transaction volumes for shit right now.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:00:10
or drug users?

Well someone hasn't read anything about this. Both the Prosecutor's main witness, a DHS agent, AND a separate DHS branch in Baltimore were investigating Karpeles in connection with Silk Road. Then the DHS branch in Baltimore apparently offered him immunity if he game them DPR. Now this doesn't PROVE that what the defense says is actually true, but it sure seems to show Karpeles is pretty involved and knew lots about SR. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:15:34
HAHAHAHAA how are you upvoted???? Let's see some actual facts
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:29:27
Yeah the guy is completely wrong lol
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:30:35
But you can just transfer from one wallet address to the next in a chain, and there's no way to definitively prove that the original owner is the final owner.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:39:54
Right, I was just giving an example of a very simple method that technically makes the coins anonymous. Sure you can say that it's "pretty obvious" that the same person controls those coins, but "pretty obvious" in that context likely wouldn't hold up in a court of law with a good defense attorney (if for some reason you had to defend yourself against a further use of those coins down the blockchain). You could easily just say that you bought the coins and sold them to someone later and have no idea what happened to them after that.
But yeah, there is no doubt that physical cash is the most anonymous way to transfer value.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:36:29
Well first of all, I was just giving a basic example as to why the parent comment was wrong. You can't PROVE in the legal sense, that the same person owned the bitcoins a couple addresses down the line. That's my main point and is why the parent comment is wrong.
Bringing tax issues into it significantly complicates the matter, but not in any way that would make the parent comment accurate.
Is buying bitcoin and selling them at the same price a taxable event? I'm not even sure about that, but if it is, go ahead and report that to the IRS. There's plenty of issues to go into when it comes to taxes, but it would take too much time to discuss, and has little to do with the original point.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:25:15
Cute thought, but double digits are pretty unlikely because the darknet markets alone require bitcoin to have a certain market cap floor to sustain themselves. Even if everyone else were to leave the BTC market, I doubt btc would be in double digits for long. It might drop there temporarily in a flash crash, but it would recover to a level that could sustain the darknet markets.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:20:30
What? I mean the darknet markets are growing, not necessarily bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-16 06:14:58
Pretty sure both these guys we're dealing with are rare folk... so... yeah.
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:03:35
Well it kind of does. The difficulty increases with increased hash-rate, and hash-rate has been consistently increasing
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:24:13
Gotchya. Yeah, I think with a good defense lawyer and a semi-reasonable jury, it might be fine, but you also might get fucked. Odds are you'd be better off taking a plea deal with our horrible justice system anyway.
But yeah, I agree with the rest of your points. Some people probably do think they are more anonymous than they actually are.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:08:33
You just said "-2015 excluded" as some sort of point against the chart lol... what?
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:44:19
I guess if you use one wallet or something...? If you use multiple wallets, it seems much more difficult to track these things the way you claim.
@_date: 2015-01-15 08:51:20
Lmao. Do you even know what ASIC means? There's no need to put "highly specialized" in front of it since the AS stands for application-specific. Anyway, supercomputers are not made with ASICs necessarily (I don't know how often they are, but I'd guess rarely), and can often be used for multiple types of tasks. I guess you could refer to a bitcoin mining operation as a supercomputer, but its pointless and would just serve to confuse the issue.
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:42:19
The DHS investigators probably aren't actually complete idiots, but okay.
I'll admit I worded my point too strongly and should have said, it appears to be a reasonable possibility that Karpeles is involved.
1) Karpeles spending all his time on MTGox... lol. Try reading this article: 
One particular example of him not working when he should have been: Ver and Powell were set to work through the weekend, but when they arrived at the company’s tiny office that Saturday, there was a surprise. Mark Karpeles had decided to take the weekend off. The two volunteers were flabbergasted. “I thought that was completely insane and demoralizing for the rest of the team,” Powell remembers. On Monday, Powell says, Karpeles did return to work, but he spent part of the day stuffing envelopes. “I was like: ‘Dude why are you doing this? You can do this anytime. The site is offline. You need to get the site online.'”
To pretend he was pouring his whole life and all his time and energy into MT Gox doesn't appear to be true, according to people that actually worked with him, but maybe you know better somehow?
2) Where is this analysis of MTGox's Transaction history? Please send a source, that would be interesting. I mean it's not like you can shuffle and obfuscate bitcoin transactions or anything, but hey, let's see a source.
3) The OpSec thing... Maybe Gox didn't get hacked and he just stole all the btc? Why would that not be possible? But anyway, I don't know, SR was compromised for like 6 months before they actually went in and took it down. Maybe the OpSec was shitty on SR the whole time.
4) His bad english... meh.
I really think your points are incredibly weak actually, but I'm sure there are plenty of stronger ones to be made.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:30:12
That's hilarious if you think the darknet markets can be sustained by 200M USD market cap for bitcoin. If you quadruple your value, I'd say you're still underselling it. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:14:21
I think I got your original point confused or something... were you just trying to say that it btc doesn't REQUIRE difficulty to consistently increase? My bad, if so, and sorry for the language, edited out.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:26:47
You're hilariously deluded if you think &lt;$30 btc is possible for a sustained period of time. A market cap of $400,000,000 cannot sustain the amount of money the darknet markets require to continue running smoothly. And those markets are not going anywhere any time soon.
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:32:54
Unless different people controlled the DPR account at different times. And remember that karpeles himself tipped the DHS off to Ulbricht. You read everything before commenting right?  Probably not... Oh well
Now I'm definitely not saying Ulbricht is innocent of running silk road by any means, but karpeles being implicated is not  outlandish given the current evidence
@_date: 2015-01-28 00:20:43
Yeah I wasn't talking about absolutely secure methods, just ones that are almost certainly good enough at this point unless you're doing some really serious shit. Cash transactions, however, will always be a way to make your Btc 100% anonymous if you really want to.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:49:51
The main use of TOR is to avoid authority and the law. You are arguing that this is a problem because in your mind I'm guessing, "drugs are bad, mkay?" 
But try thinking about other countries where the people are blatantly oppressed and don't have free speech because of the current laws and regimes. Those oppressed people being able to freely communicate through TOR sure seems like a good thing in that case, doesn't it?
Now realize that this country outlawing drug use is a similar idea to what's going on in those countries, albeit on a much less invasive and terrible level.
@_date: 2015-01-16 16:01:13
Yup still plenty to be seen in the trial... and it should be interesting.
But I don't know why you would ever believe a word Karpeles says about anything, let alone when it comes to publicly admitting to any criminal acts. He made the most basic "It wasn't me" statement possible, it's meaningless.
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:40:49
I still don't understand the rebuttal to the absolute simplest of solutions. If you buy bitcoins, even using an account tied to your government ID (e.g. coinbase) and then transfer them a few times in a chain, there isn't really a way to LEGALLY PROVE that the coins still belong to you. You could have sold/transferred them to another party...
If you buy them with cash from someone, it's just completely impossible to tie your identity to the wallet in the first place.
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:10:27
It's obviously a growing market, though (probably rapidly growing).
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:27:55
Even if you just buy some bitcoins WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT ID INVOLVED (e.g. Coinbase) and transfer them to a few different wallet addresses yourself in a chain, there's really no way to PROVE that you own the coins in the final wallet. You could have easily transferred them to anyone, at which point it's really no longer your problem. So... What were you saying again?
edit: Lol downvoted with no explanation as to why this is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:26:23
Most of the coins are trash ideas. Bitcoin and ether potentially, yes. Maybe a couple others. Maybe not. But how does the magnitude of a bubble have any bearing on it being a bubble or not?
Basically the whole market is driven by speculation right now. Very little of value aside from the drug trade has actually happened with bitcoin or other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:32:50
Wut? I dont even understand what youre saying. You would be wrong about saying it was a bubble in your bizarre hypothetical, but thats neither here nor there.
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:45:23
Well... not exactly. There needs to be a person buying every coin that is sold. That's how markets work. People just aren't willing to pay as much per coin would be a more accurate statement.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:24:31
Actually no, your "I.e." is utter nonsense, and that's my point. More coins can't possibly be sold than are being bought. Pretty basic fact. They can at a certain price, but that's a slightly different thing to be saying.
@_date: 2015-08-24 19:45:58
Not really. You need a person to buy a coin for every coin that is sold. People just aren't willing to pay as much per coin is what you mean.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:26:57
Well only a moron shorts a bubble to begin with because you can't predict when it pops.
Additionally i have btc and wouldn't short it. Im just saying irrational exuberence usually means bubble. And theres not a lot backing up btc value yet. Its speculation. Its not necessarily wrong, but facts are facts.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:13:47
Not really. The current crypto market is likely exactly the same deal as the dot com boom era of the internet. Crypto and blockchain tech will be used in the future. The future and future value of btc or any other specific crypto is highly uncertain. Most new ICOs range from garbage ideas that will crash in value to straight up scams.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:38:31
It *might* go below 1k, but i doubt it. Everyone forgets the only actual market that bitcoin has been used for, the drug trade. Unless dark net markets switch to another crypto there's always some real floor of several billion dollars in market cap to sustain those markets. I wouldn't be surprised if 1000/coin or about 15 bil USD was necessary to maintain that. It might temporarily drop below, but wouldn't stay for long.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:28:46
It's not going to 0 as long as dark net markets exist. Unless they decide to switch cryptos, they build in a price floor of probably a few hundred per coin.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:18:26
This is not true. Dark net markets put some kind of price floor on it. I'm not sure where, but certainly well over $100.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:27:34
Drug market alone puts some floor on the value. Idk what it is though
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:26:16
$32 was the highest price in 2011, and it never dropped from 90 to 15 in its history.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:25:39
It wasn't 90 in 2011, and it never dropped from 90 to 15 ever, so probably your confusion comes in because that guy is a liar.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:47:29
I also think some exchanges are inaccessible through TOR. Pretty sure I tried logging on bitstamp on TOR for the hell of it one time and it didn't work, although I could be wrong / it may have changed / I may have just gotten unlucky with endpoints, although I did refresh my network a few times. At the very least, they would function really poorly, though I guess people could live with that. But like you said, you still have to worry about converting between bitcoin and your currency regardless.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:36:23
Or he still has a bunch and doesn't care :P
@_date: 2015-03-22 20:55:26
What printer did you use?
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:31:24
Land does. You need a place to exist and can use it for literal necessities e.g. growing food. Also food, although food doesn't exactly appreciate.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:08:36
Its appears you are DEFINING value as something socially defined and then saying that value is socially defined. Circular argument and pointless. 
And this philosophical tangent really doesn't add to the discussion about bitcoin then. food, air, and Water will always have a value to people. A biological, practical value. One person wanting to kill themselves doesn't change that it has value especially in an economic sense which is the actual point.  We Were talking  about economic value in the beginning. 
Edit: bacteria does value water. Just because it doesn't have the circuitry to REALIZE it values water doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't value it imo. Na+ values Cl- too :-P
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:00:12
Yeah it's an awesome book. You'd probably like it. The sequel lila  is actually much better, but You kinda need to read zen for background. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:25:46
I'm certainly not.  I used a different definition of value though. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:49:38
I know that they don't "want" anything.  I was using value in a different sense, like pirsig uses in zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance / lila. 
I said it before I realized exactly what you meant by value
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:41:19
No it doesn't.  This is just ridiculous but there is biological value to food and water that is NOT socially defined.  Bacteria values water and has no social structure
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:15:42
I'm not setting a price floor by saying something has a universal value. That's complete nonsense. Value isn't always defined in $ obviously.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:53:08
You're kidding yourself if you don't think the government could find ways to hinder, or even stop the progress of bitcoin. It's almost certain that other crypto currencies would take it's place, or maybe it would be resilient enough to recover, but yeah... like the guy says in layer cake, "it is only very stupid people who think the law is stupid"
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:35:51
No. Value doesn't necessarily have to be quantifiable.  That's an outlandish statement. I value my girlfriend and I have NO idea how you would even begin to quantify that. What units would the quantity be in? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:23:49
Lol maths. Yeah ~6 *30k at best. Less really
