Fair enough, but then quantifying that probability is an essential part of the analysis, or it still predicts nothing.


Maybe this is the source of our disagreement then. I agree that if the theory assigns some probabilities (even if roughly) to trend lines then it is in principle falsifiable.

Can you formalize what you mean by "vbuterin's argument"? Because I don't see anything nonstandard in his post, except the assumption that exactly one out of five trends will prove correct (which is obviously not true since there are other possibilities too,  but even if we assume that your argument fails).


No, at best you have a 1/5 chance, and that is if you pick uniformly at random. vbuterin didn't say anything about probability distributions so you can't just assume that each trend is equally likely.
@_date: 2012-01-04 03:29:51
The keyword here is *valid*. I don't think the BitCoin client validates the blockchain every time it is started (that would probably take too long) so if you get a copy of the blockchain that has been tampered with, there may be some transactions in it that are not part of the "real" blockchain.
I have trouble imagining what good this would do to an attacker, though. But just to be on the safe side, blockchain data obtained from an untrusted source should be completely verified before it is used by the client. (The BitCoin client already does that when it downloads the blockchain normally.)
Personally I would just suck it up and wait a little for the initial data to download. It only needs to be done once, and if you setup clients on multiple computers that you control, you can easily copy the blockchain without worrying about security.

Yes, and lacking a trusted third party to moderate the exchange, one of you will have to make the first move on good faith that the other party will reciprocate.
If I'm a programmer and I don't trust you to send me money through Paypal, why would I trust you to pay me with Bitcoin?


In other words: anyone is free to drive up the prices with phony bids without risking having to pay their bid or otherwise being held accountable for manipulating the auction.
(A way to fix this would be to require all participants to make a deposit at the start of the auction, to be returned after they have fulfilled their obligations. Then participants need to trust a third party, but in the case of this forum you already trust them enough to pay them in advance for an advertising campaign.)

This isn't how probability theory works at all. The Bitcoin market is not random; it just appears that way. You cannot simply assume every possible future trend is equally likely (and even if they were, you cannot simply pick 5 arbitrary ones and then conclude that each has chance 1/5 of occuring).

Ok, so then I don't see that as much of a deterrent. If the attacker controls less than 50% of the processing power (otherwise, they could split the block chain if they wanted to) then banned transactions take only twice as long to process. That's mildly inconvenient at best, but it's not at all like freezing an account.

So what happens if I receive payment from someone for a product or service I provided them with, then later it is decided that my customer, unbeknownst to me, obtained the money through fraud? It sounds like *I* would end up suffering for their crime.
One of the benefits of BitCoin is that transactions are irreversible. Once a transaction has been solidified in the block chain I can be certain that I have received my money. The proposed system would throw that out of the window.

It doesn't exactly work like that; the client keeps a pool of 100 unused keys around, and whenever one is taken from the pool, it generates a new one. (Sometimes, keys are temporarily reserved and then later returned to the pool, so it is possible but rare for the pool to store more than 100 free keys.)
So the pool never becomes empty, and since the client doesn't keep track of which keys are backed up and which aren't, it will not notify you. You'll just have to backup your wallet frequently if you perform a lot of transactions.
If you do worry that you will run out of (backed up) keys, you can pre-generate a large amount of keys by running bitcoin -keypool=10000 to generate (for example) 10,000 keys. This will make the wallet.dat file a lot larger, and prevent the client from generating more keys for a while, because if you run it without the -keypool option it will only top off the pool when the number of keys left goes below 100.

To be technically correct:


You can easily do exactly that! The question of whether anyone is still using it, is something else entirely. I imagine the majority of donations could well be returned this way, though.
(Not saying that I'm disagreeing with the way they are handling things; just saying that if they *wanted* to return the donations, they technically could, and probably at lower cost than with bank transfers or other anonymous donations.)
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:02:16
Yes, that is what it will lead to, because blocking certain transactions alone is utterly ineffective, because there will be plenty of rogue miners willing to process them (possibly for a somewhat higher transaction fee).
So to keep these transactions out of the block chain, you'd have to ban all blocks containing any banned transactions, et voilá, you're forking the block chain.
If you have a different idea of how addresses can effectively be blocked without forking the block chain, please explain.
@_date: 2011-07-16 18:56:37
This is probably a sign that you are behind a firewall or NAT router. The client tries to create up to 8 outbound connections. After that, additional connections are from other clients that try to connect to *you*.
If you are "stuck" with 8 connections, that probably means you can connect to other clients, but they cannot connect to you. That shouldn't be very problematic if you are receiving blockchain updates quickly enough.
The fact that I typically see 30-60 connections probably means there are many more users like you. :-)
@_date: 2011-07-27 07:06:26
In the bottom-right corner your client tells you how longs it thinks the blockchain is ("2 blocks" in this case). You can check on a site like  what the latest block number really is.
Ideally, these numbers are equal. It's ok if you are sometimes behind a few blocks for a while, as long as you eventually catch up.

Are you crazy? The probability that your hard drive breaks down due to mechanical failure* is far greater than the probability of a solar flare wiping out your wallet.
The easy solution is to backup your wallet every once in a while (e.g. to a USB flash drive or an SSD card, or to an online storage service like Dropbox or Amazon S3, or both). Be sure to encrypt your backup though (or wait until the BitCoin client includes support for encrypted wallets).

Ok, you could call that bribery (it's stretching the definition, but I understand what you mean). However, it is not related to democracy. For example, Germany's financial policy is much more conservative than that of Greece, Italy or Spain, yet it is just as much or even more democratic than these Southern European countries.
All across Europe, political parties have made a huge point of the need to balance the budget and reduce the national debt. In the Netherlands, where I live, the government is made up of the parties that proposed make the most radical budget cuts of all, which they are doing right now. *People voted for them.* In the meantime, Belgium lacks a democratically elected government for over a year now, and it is the only Northern-European country that is in a financial danger zone. Coincidence?
You seem to believe that people blindly vote for whoever offers the biggest handout. But in reality the opposite seems to happen. People are afraid that if spending is not controlled, their future and that of their children will look bleak.
Let me ask you a question. Am I correct in assuming that you live in a democratic country and you are unsatisfied with the budgeting of your current government? If so, do you think your government would do a *better* job if they were *not* held accountable by the public?

It does change over time: whenever you generate a new receiving address, a new public/private key pair is stored in the wallet.
You never need to be able to go back to *older* versions, so hg isn't really necessary, if you are careful not to overwrite the newer version with an older one instead of the other way around. And even that is only problematic if the old version is so old that it doesn't contain the keys to addresses that have been used to receive money in the new version.

Your "error" is in point 3 and 4: according to Dutch law, the buyer *can* legally become the owner of the item that is in their possession (under certain circumstances).


This is not just my perspective, this is the law. By selling an item that does not (wholly) belong to you, you have caused damage to its owner, but (under Dutch law) this does not invalidate the sale itself.
I called it circular reasoning before, because you seem to presuppose the US law (at least as you explained it to me) as correct, and then dismiss any other system for not being equal to the US law.
At least I acknowledge that both systems have their merits. They are very similar in that they both forbid theft. They only differ in the details of how they distribute the losses among the involved parties when a thief steals and subsequently sells something.


According to Dutch law, it did occur (again, under certain circumstances).


The catch is that under Dutch law, it is no longer their property, and thus they cannot reclaim it from the new owner, and it is the original owner that should seek redress. The new owner would do well to coöperate, of course, because if they cannot demonstrate that they legally obtained the item under the right circumstances, then they have to give up the item or may even be persecuted for dealing in stolen goods.

There are a lot of accusations in that video, and precious little proof to substantiate them.
In particular the main argument (the US attacks oil-exporting countries if they threaten to accept any currency other than USD) seems to fall apart when you consider that it is mainly France (EUR) and Britain (GBP) leading the fight in Libya, with only relatively little support from the United States. Furthermore, the war was definitely not started by European or American forces.
Put this all together and there seems little logic to the accusation that the Libyan war started over oil.

I always wondered about this. Why don't GPU miners verify solutions they find on the CPU? That should prevent invalid blocks from ever being sent to the pool (and then rejected) and would give the user some feedback on the performance of the system (a high error rate might mean you've overclocked too much). The extra CPU load should be negligible since valid blocks are very rarely found.
Are there any authors of miner software on here? If so, why don't you do this?

You need less than 1KB per keypair (bitcoin address); initially your wallet contains 100 addresses. So a 1MB volume would allow around 1000  incoming transactions to be performed (assuming you use a different address for each). Creating a somewhat bigger partition so it has room to grow may be a good idea if you expect to use BitCoin intensively.
@_date: 2011-06-21 17:52:50


True, that's not clear at all. BitCoin does *claim* to be money, but I'm not sure what qualifies as money under this law. Note that it mentions cheques and money order too, neither of which are legal tender.
Anyway, I don't think it is very relevant what the precise legal situation according to Dutch law is anyway, because neither party lives here. I only wanted to point out that the rule of "stolen goods must be returned to their original owner" is not universal at all.


That's just circular reasoning. I can equally claim that ethically, the owner was wronged by the thief, not by the innocent buyer. The thief owes the original owner their item back (or equivalent compensation). The innocent buyer should have no obligation towards the original owner, and it is unfair to force the innocent buyer to compensate the original owner for the thief's dishonesty.
See the symmetry? There are three parties, one is a criminal; if the criminal steals from one party and sells to the other, then the thief's gain will be one of the other's loss, and since both of these parties are innocent, this will always be unfair. The only solution is to make the criminal restore the situation by returning what was owed.


Exactly: the fact that one person was robbed, does not mean they can "steal back" their stuff from an innocent third party.
So to summarize, I'm still not convinced one system is inherently more fair than the other, but I found it interesting to learn of your point of view.
@_date: 2011-06-19 07:19:48
I think it's just another case of malicious nodes trying to split the block chain. It's a fundamental weakness of the system (it is designed to follow the majority consensus) but it's not a very likely event.
If you think it *is* likely then you are probably overestimating the efficiency of any government when it comes to regulating such activities. Governments around the world have legislated against illegal file sharing, but BitTorrent is still widely used for this purpose. Similarly, if a large country (say, the USA) would outlaw 'mainstream' BitCoin, that wouldn't stop people from using it.
Finally, consider that miners have no incentive to split a block chain, because then they risk not getting paid.  If I had an expensive mining operation and the government would prevent me from contributing to the main block chain, then I would either (1) shut down my business so at least I don't incur further costs on rent, power and maintenance or (2) move my expensive hardware to another country and continue working on the main chain there. Either way I would not contribute to the malicious chain, and this isn't even taking idealistic considerations into account.
@_date: 2011-06-16 20:57:34
I don't think the client *needs* to do that. It could have a secure wallet with a master password that is entered whenever the user wants to do a transaction.
This might sound problematic when generating blocks in the background (because whenever the block changes, the private key is needed to sign the transaction that assigns the reward to the current user), but this is easily fixed by always using a new bitcoin address when generating blocks. When a block is generated (which is pretty rare anyway) the user can transfer it to the secure wallet easily.
Note that encrypted wallets aren't really protection against hackers having access to your computer. If a hacker installs a keylogger he can still steal your master password and the contents of your protected wallet. However, there are scenarios where hackers can access some files but do not have the ability to run arbitrary processes. A secure wallet would offer protection there.
@_date: 2011-06-21 16:27:15
It's called a "derdenbeschermingsbepaling" (or "third-party protection provision"). I looked it up, but it is much more limited than I claimed.
I'll quote from [article 86 of BW3]( (the civil code) and try to freely translate the relevant parts to give you the gist of it, because I don't have an English-language source:










This is a very rough translation, because the law is full of legal terms which I can interpret but cannot translate into English accurately.
For the hypothetical example of a stolen motorbike, this means that the motorbike could indeed be reclaimed within three years *unless* the new owner was a private person (i.e. not a business) who bought it from what appeared to be a legitimate business (so a professional bike store or something). This protects consumers buying from brick-and-mortar-stores, though for business-to-business and constumer-to-consumer transactions the recipient takes a risk.
BitCoin is money though, so it falls under the exception of 3b, and then you would still not be able to reclaim it. (Effectively this means if somebody steals money and uses it to purchase goods from someone else, then you cannot reclaim your stolen money, as long as the person acted in good faith, of course.)


I think both cases are about equally unfair. How is it fair that if you paid good money for a TV, somebody can come in and reclaim it from you, even though you didn't do anything wrong? In both cases an innocent person gets shafted; the real solution of course, is to find the original thief and reclaim your loss from him.
(Note that buying things far below market value can be construed as proof that you should have known the goods were stolen and are thus acting in bad faith, which is itself a crime -- *heling*, or *handling of stolen goods* in English. For BitCoins, it's hard to say what a fair market value is, because the market is extremely volatile.)
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:31:17


I agree, theft is unjust, because it deprives a rightful owner of their rightful property, whether it is person A who owned the item, or person B who paid their money for the item. To deprive person A of their item is a crime, but to deprive person B of their money is a crime too.


Under US law (and under Dutch law under certain conditions) person B is unjustly deprived of their money. I don't see this as fundamentally better.
Since we appear to be going in circles now, shall we just agree to disagree on this?
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:31:57


Dutch law student here. Under our law a purchase contract remains valid regardless whether the goods being traded were stolen (i.e. the seller did not have a right to sell them), except for either of two conditions:
 * the recipient received the goods for free;
 * the recipient was not acting in good faith (conspired with the seller, or he knew, or should have known, that the goods were stolen).
The law is formulated like this to protect buyers who act in good faith from having the stuff they bought repossessed.
I know nothing about Japanese law, unfortunately, but if they have similar provisions, then it is up to Mt Gox to show that Kevin acted in bad faith and was not simply trying to profit from legitimate market fluctuations. I imagine it would be difficult to show that when Mt Gox themselves acted as the intermediary, thereby greenlighting the transaction.

You are right that it's not really a reversal, because the fraudster doesn't get their money back, but from my point of view, the money might as well be gone because nobody will accept it.


Again, this puts the burden on merchants. Another one of the advantages of BitCoin is that it requires no service contracts or fees to accept it. If I have to sign and pay for a service contract to use BitCoin, I might as well talk to Visa.
For normal people it's even less attractive compared to the current implementation of BitCoin. What percentage of current users do you think have contracts to accept credit card right now? What percentage of users do you think would continue using BitCoin if it required buying insurance to be used (or risk being screwed if they don't)?

Iraq notably sold their oil for Euros for a few years, but this was only under the food-for-oil program as they were under embargo. If they had been able to sell on the free market they would probably still have used the USD.
Switching to another currency is talked about from time to time, though in practice the status quo remains. Iran and Venezuela have both proposed switching to the Euro. Neither country have been invaded by the US (Iran is definitely at risk, but for plenty of other reasons) even though both produce more oil than either Iraq or Libya.
The decision isn't really up to the oil-producing countries; the currency used by the exchanges is what is used to negotiate prices. Iran already doesn't accept dollars (to spite the US, no doubt) but in practice it makes little difference, because their oil is still priced in dollars. That only means people with dollars just need to convert their currency first, much like they'd have to do with gold or BitCoins.

Well, that does clear up a lot.


I wish they, like you, would try living in Somalia for a decade or so, just to see how much they like anarchy in practice.

Ah, indeed it didn't. Apparently it doesn't work if I play the embedded video in Reddit, but clicking the link to view it on YouTube would have worked.
(I still find his analysis really terrible; it's nice that he supports BitCoin, but he doesn't have anything insightful to say about it that we haven't heard here before.)

The Raspberry Pi 2 should be good enough for a few years, and by then there's probably a Raspberry Pi 3 or something with even better specs.

I could easily claim it is the other way around. US law makes person B pay because thief C stole from person A, so person B is deprived of their money **by law**. Under Dutch law, when thief C steals from A, only person A is deprived of their property **by the thief**.


The law should not steal from an innocent third-party to compensate the original owner either, which is what happens in the US system. As I've said many times before, unless the thief is made to pay, the situation will always be unjust for some innocent person.
Really, if you cannot see the equivalency here, I'm afraid we will never arrive at an end and we are better off leaving it at this. :-)

[Are you sure?](
Still, I would think that with a setup like that, you are going to mine in a pool (either a public or local, private one) so that you aren't storing the actual bitcoins on the individual computers in the cluster. In that case, you don't need reliable storage at all, except for the single server that manages the cluster.

Because consumers don't pay this interest on the money in their checking accounts.
If you exceed the limit of your checking account (typically around $1,000,000) then you should probably consider investing some of your excess cash anyway, rather than putting it in a safe at home.

Not to mention that "disestablishmentarianism" is a noun; the adjective that actually fits in the sentence would be "disestablishmentarian".

The ScriptSig and ScriptPubKey fields of a transaction can contain arbitrary data. In fact, the data bgog found is part of the original block's ScriptSig which would show up in the raw block data.
I don't think anyone else has ever included arbitrary data there, though, as it would require hacking the BitCoin client.

I can't take someone seriously who equates democracy literally with "some Nigerian who offers you money for nothing" or alternatively "a system of bribery":


No, you "genius". It is paid for by taxes and (in the case of pension funds) by employers and employees. As long as the government balances its income with its expenses, debt is unnecessary.
Of course it is true that countries are terrible at balancing their budgets. However, to connect this with democracy is ridiculous, because many nations throughout history have gone bankrupt, and only few of those were democracies. 
Excessive debt caused the downfall of the Roman Empire, and that of the Spanish Empire a thousand year later. It ruined Germany after the first World War. Only ten years ago it bankrupted Argentina. Of all these examples, only Argentina was actually a democracy. Why do you think democracy is the common factor in this?
If you have followed the news at all (instead of watching crackpots on YouTube) you would know that the current problems in Greece are, if anything, caused by corruption and *lack* of a transparent government. If you look up the [democracy ranking]( you'll see that Greece is actually scoring poorly as a democracy, at least compared to other EMU-countries. On the other hand, most of Northern Europe is in the top of the list, and is doing relatively well financially too. This seems to suggest, at least for EMU-countries, the more democratic the country is, the more secure their financial position is too.
I hope my facts and figures didn't bore you. I'm just not good with hollow rhetorics. I guess that's why nobody watches me on YouTube. I hope I did manage to save you from emigrating to North-Korea, Libya, Nigeria or Russia, countries which prosper financially thanks to their lack of democracy.

In that case, it would make more sense for them to buy Bitcoin directly rather than spend cash on hardware and electricity to generate Bitcoin over time.

What happens if the device dies? Can you back up the wallet somewhere?
