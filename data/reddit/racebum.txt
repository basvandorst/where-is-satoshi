That's not actually true. The dollar is not truly decoupled. It's heavily reliant on GDP And Trades via Forex . The entire world assigns the value of the US dollar. While there is nothing tangible behind it like gold. What exactly is gold good for? It's great for motherboards . makes pretty good jewelry but honestly you can't eat it. It only has a value humans assign to it. The Federal Reserve can literally inflate to Infinity so there is no real bubble there. Eventually we are going to run out of resources and use all of the oil in the ground and it's going to come crashing down anyway. The strength I see in Bitcoin is replacing PayPal. Possibly visa and MasterCard. If the technology continues to develop it makes electronic monetary transfer extremely easy. Wall Street really needs to get involved and it needs to become more mainstream. Right now you hear about hacks and scams pretty much daily. It's the wild west right now because not that many people are actually in it and security is not nearly as good as it should be

I think we finally went full retard today. this isn't specific to only Bitcoin and it is more ethereum related. gpus are sold out everywhere. The price of used 1070's on eBay right now is 6 to $700. It's extremely difficult to find any quality GPU without paying through the roof. Literally 6 weeks ago I remember getting a 1080 on Black Friday for 489. I'm not even really sure what to make of this as I've only seen a computer item do this one other time in my life and I was a little kid. There was a time in the 90s when Ram went to like $1,000 per stick.

If it's anything like Securities and Futures when you see that kind of behavior it just means large sellers have set exit points. It really doesn't mean anything other than that. One of two things is going to happen. They will exhaust their supply and the return higher will continue. They will exhaust some of their supply and the price will start to fall. If they are still holding a lot of coin and they chase the downfall they are just going to drive it lower. Looking at the Bitcoin chart from a technical analysis perspective it's beyond overbought. That also means absolutely nothing with Bitcoin. I don't think there is any rational way to even remotely predict where the price will go. You literally just have to make your own choices

That assumes people are going to have any interest in these altcoins. Right now there is a bit of a gambling fever the same way pets.com took off in the late 90s. Once people get their head on straight only the strongest of the strong are going to survive and that's where you're going to see the technology advanced. Every chart in history that looks like the current crypto charts always ends with a massive sell-off. That doesn't mean the movement is over by a mile. It just means that technology needs to settle and it needs to become more mainstream.

Yeah that's not really true man. Let's take a look at some other inflated markets. We had the tech boom. We had the market crash in 2008. We had the gold bubble. These are also different markets. If we rewind back to 2013 Bitcoin went from $20 to $1,000 in a year. It was totally manipulated too. There were some damn bots on Mount gox making that happen. Market crashes but the lowest Bitcoin ever went was like a hundred and sixty bucks and the real low was more like 200 bucks. That's where it hung out for a little while. That's 10 x from where it started and it was all built on bullshit. 
2017 began a little over $1,000 and while we didn't get quite as lucky this time with a 10x we're not really doing all that bad with a 5700 low. Now obviously we did not have milk ducts blow up which is a very good thing but we did have a lot of people buying this on their credit cards and second mortgages on their house and all kinds of crazy crap. Now those people got liquidated. After that we have the second set of sellers. The depressed crowd I like to call them. Now they bought in and expected things to go higher and that didn't happen so they sell. Finally you have the fake strong hands. The people that think I can hold on to this. Then eventually there comes a Tipping Point where they just lose it and think Bitcoin is doomed and they finally sell. I've been around markets for awhile so this particular psychological cycle does not scare me. 
Let's look at some facts. The lightning network is increasing and usefulness at a very rapid pace. Each month we are further ahead than we were before. We are seeing multiple institutions talking about custody Solutions and getting involved in the game to some degree. We have a market that is valued at one hell of a lot more money than it was in the beginning of 2017. 
I'm sorry but your comment is actually extremely bullish because I can tell you're a pretty intelligent guy and you have a great Post history and you seem to be fairly intellectual . when people like you shift from Hope to doubt that is like the Golden Cross to me. That is what I have seen time and time again around Market bottoms. Now I'm not saying we are definitely at the bottom but that trait, and I've seen it with more people than just you is extremely common around bottoms. 
If the cycle plays out totally textbook the next phase we should go into is disbelief. The market will slowly grind higher and you will see the lows hold on pullbacks. The majority of people will doubt it and keep talking about when it's going to roll over. The difference this time is that won't happen. You never really know where the bottom is until after you have made it but there are some really good signs that tell you you might be around one.

Maybe, but his story does make a little sense in this one way. If people are dumping their alt coins and scared things are just going to keep going lower, on some exchanges all you can do is go to tether. I would say probably 8 out of 10 people are convinced Bitcoin is going to go to at least 5,000 and all of the altcoins are going to go lower. Ironically that's what I would expect at a bottom even though that's not what I'm suggesting. Anyway if people are dumping all of those coins it doesn't make sense that they would need to print more tether. 
The number one reason I personally don't believe the tether conspiracy theory is because it's not that profitable. It's more profitable for them to keep up trading volume and keep the system Square. The one time we may have had some tether manipulation was that 6 week period From November 1st until January 15th. If you look at the curve it is pretty unnatural, but then again a ton of people could have came in at that time since Bitcoin was on TV every hour
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:17:13
All true but the break even selling requires being off the lows. 
The failure of shitcoins is expected and a lot of the fomo crowd was in those. What I truly don't get about this one is everyone expected the news to play out exactly like it did and it was used as an excuse to sell off. Retesting 5700 seems pretty much inevitable at this point

I think I'm heading towards a 90/10 split with Bitcoin and Monero
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:47:05
The long-term trend is we keep stair stepping up. 1500 undercuts that. It's a near reset to the beginning of the last bull market and something that has never happened. I'm not sure what year you were referring to but crypto mining is actually banned and illegal in Venezuela right now. If someone is caught mining on the free Power they go to prison. We have had a few guys from Venezuela in here talk about Mining and all of them have to smuggle in equipment. That leaves a very very very small percentage of the population able to do such a thing. That country is in shambles right now. If it were easy to do bitmain would not be going to Walla Walla. That makes $0.05 a kilowatt hour about Bottom Dollar for realistic mining operations. At .05kwh about $3,000 is break even not counting the cost of equipment or upkeep or maintenance or anything and in 2020 when we have a halving we need to be double that. Regardless of if they would do a proof of work change or how they would handle a 51% attack it would compromise trust in Bitcoin and set the project back years at a minimum.
The bottom line is you don't draw in new people with collapsing prices and new people are what push things higher. If people get so greedy that they drive the price down to $1,500 this whole thing deserves to fail as the community does not deserve a successful project
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:07:15
Yeah I'm sure that's going to happen again I'm just not convinced it will be this year. It's going to take awhile for people's emotions to switch over.
It's like that ridiculous comment that we have heard all year. Yeah I'm bullish long-term but I'm short-term bearish.
I really don't think it will take a lot to get people excited again period a few key players that bring our trading range up to $10,000 would probably bring a lot of people back. We just need to have a series of higher highs begin even if we go into a sideways range. I think the most depressing part right now is that every month you keep getting lower lows and people wonder where it's going to end

 If that happens, and it may or may not. On the one hand you can say the chart looks similar, which it does I agree. On the other we have a night and day fundamentally different situation. Mount gox did not blow up and we did not have Marcus and Wiley running this up to the high. 
If we actually repeat the 2014-2015 chart I will pretty much lose all confidence in crypto and develop sheer hatred for the people in the space. It will confirm that it's nothing more than a Gambling Hall. Nothing more than a bunch of coked-up speculators pulling the strings.
At that point there will be no question that the market is manipulated
There is one key difference this time if you are looking at pure technical patterns and you tune out all of the fundamentals. 2018 is happening roughly four times as fast as 2014. If you make the 2014 and 2015 chart a 3 or 4 day chart on the bars and you make 2018 one day chart they line up really well
You start looking at percentage correction and we have coins like Litecoin that are already 82% off the high and many shit coins that are 90% or more off their highs. Bitcoin has already corrected 70%. If you look at every run up and crash since 2009 we are actually in the ballpark right now.

If large holders actually believed tether was a total sham they would not be holding bitcoin. The price would be false. 2013 was manipulated up but to this date no evidence has came forward on that happening in 2017. The only suspect 6 week period was nov1 to jan 15 and if it was manipulated the exchange could have uncooked the books by now. The main reason tether hasn't been audited as near as I can tell is because its heavily used for tax evasion

Just left a conference with an engineer from Intel. Picked his brain about what's new. Long story short he said 7nm will not disappoint. I then asked about 10nm as it's not even out yet. Internal debate on moving forward but the gains on 7nm are massive I was told. TSMC has a 7nm process out already. Anyone who has been able to develop an asic on 7nm from what he was saying would have a massive advantage.

I think there might be something to the general theory but it's hard to say if the banking cartel's are behind any of it or all of it. There are a lot of fake buy and sell Walls that get put up especially in low liquidity markets. Wash Trading. The market is being manipulated down right now and that usually doesn't last very long. I think what you said about destroying young inexperienced traders is pretty much right on. If they can get people to panic and sell it amplifies their shorts. Then it's a game of chicken to see who covers first.

Price really doesn't matter. It's really more mentality. It doesn't matter if someone has .1 BTC or 1 BTC for xxx price. 
A lot of regular people chase prices. You're going to have more people buying .1 btc at 25k than you will people buying 1 at 2.5k
Low prices scare people off that's why this thing has been feeding on itself. People say that bullshit about crypto moving faster than Wall Street but this bear Market is lasting longer or at least as long as the average equities bear Market
The real irony I find is there is absolutely no reason for it. I can point to very specific reasons in every equities bear Market in the past hundred years. I can even point to a really good reason in the last Bitcoin bear Market. This one however. Zero
The only thing we're going to get if we have substantial drops from here is a drop-in Network hash power. Then you're going to see a lot of the altcoins get 51% attacked
That's the one thing I find very concerning about the price action right now and this setup we are creating for another drop. There is no reason whatsoever for it. That is substantially different than 2014

Okay. If you don't want to compare it to that market let's look at prior Bitcoin bear markets which look completely different than 2014-2015. Even making comments like those who have been around since 2013 shows an emotional historical bias. It makes a person think what happened in the past will happen again and that's a problem
The bottom line of my point is I think this is probably one of the most destructive rumors that has been going around all year. The theory that this bear Market will be exactly like 2014 and 2015. What is so damaging about that thought is it prevents people from looking at current information and assuming things will play out in a certain way
Like I said above the fact of the matter right now is we have a series of lower highs. If you are right we will find out before the end of the year and probably before November because we will finally get a higher high on the long chart
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:48:11
Is that possible? Absolutely. Is it probable? I certainly don't think so because there are a couple of situations that would make that happen. The first one is people in droves losing interest. That's not happening. The news is actually very positive. Searches are starting to trickle up again. I think a lot of the people who got burned in January are going to be very hesitant but what is going to kill these people a second time is they are going to sit on the sidelines and wait and watch and when things start going again and increasing they are going to start to fomo in after we have already had a substantial price rise. When we take it out $20,000 you will see people come out of the woodwork. I have no idea how high we are going to go on the next cycle but I think a million is very optimistic. 40 to 50000 is what I would call a low Target and 100,000 is what I would call a high Target. If you look at all of the run-ups we have had since 2009 the percentage increase keeps shrinking as the dollar amount keeps increasing. 
2020 is when the next Bitcoin halving happens. After that event takes place you're going to have half the amount of new coins on the market everyday. That is going to create a scarce vacuum as the months go on just like it has in the past

It also assumes the same pattern is going to repeat. 
Even if it is moving along faster
Yet another way to say it is the recession and drawdown after the tech bust in Y2K and the housing crisis both caused deep bear markets. However they look completely different because the fundamentals of the situation are completely different. There are similarities if you look for them but they are not the same
Looking at the fundamentals of mining right now and what net production cost is even in the best case scenarios, I think calling for a bottom with a 5 in front of it makes a hell of a lot more sense than a 3. Why would a miner sell coin under production cost? They will hodl or shut down. If they hodl daily supply reduced which will pop price up
If your theory is correct we will find out very soon because we will finally get a higher high on the long chart. Right now the sad situation is we have a series of lower highs since the peak

You have to understand. Security is Paramount with Bitcoin. Many of us would feel more comfortable sending 1 million u.s. dollars across the Bitcoin Network than we would having the banks wire it. As long as the address is correct there is no chance of failure on the Bitcoin Network.
A lot of these projects coins do not have that kind of security. No where near. 
People are working on Smart contracts for Bitcoin . scaling is coming along well. The lightning network is coming along well. There is more going on at Bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency.

A lot of other people that got in towards the top seem to be flipping out and panic selling the bottom. Maybe that's why there are so few Bitcoin millionaires. They all Panic so when the emotions get the best of them

 As people are pointing out over and over, this is not a problem with Bitcoin it's a problem with some of the institutional custody Solutions and criminals. We are very early in the history of cryptocurrency. When people were building some of the first computers there were all kinds of problems. You look at where we are today and even your grandma can use one. Bitcoin will evolve over the next 10 to 20 to 30 years.
In one of your other posts you mention losing a lot of money with Bitcoin. Number one you haven't lost it yet. By that of course I mean if you sit tight and hang on the odds are extremely strong in your favor that history will continue on as it has. Number two you have to ask yourself if you would feel this way if you made a lot of money in Bitcoin. Imagine having a new GT-R in the driveway and a bunch of money in your savings account. Would you still feel this way?

Higher than we are now is definitely possible. Absolutely everyone is expecting a market crash right now which is exactly why I don't think we will have one.
In my opinion the worst case scenario is a drawdown around the $5,000 range for a final flush out. If you pull up the weekly chart on bitcoin and look at some of the momentum indicators like the stochastic and RSI on a long-term basis. The stochastic especially was a major tell in the 2014 bear Market. The lowest price did not happen then but the momentum down did Peak. There was a very brief like less than a week draw down under $200 I think it was early 2015 period from there it was smooth sailing. If history is going to repeat we are going to have a final blow out and it feels like it is underway. You look at the price of a lot of the altcoins and they have dropped 30 to 50% in a month. Either this is the capitulation move we are in the middle of or it is very near. At least that's what I'm saying. It's like bear Euphoria right now and most everyone is convinced that's the way it's going to continue. That's exactly the same mentality people had in December on the upside. People were calling for 50 or a hundred K back then. It's just like the people who keep repeating 3K or 2K or whatever low number they come up with right now.

I'm sure there are some people who do that. I'm not one of them. I don't wish to insult you, or roger or anyone else over there. In fact Roger is the reason I got into crypto. I started reading this book and he was in it. It just grabbed my attention. I totally understood his thought process. I totally related to excessive law enforcement. I mean let's be real he doesn't deserve a felony for what he did. It was enough to grab my attention. I was hooked.
 I don't dislike his project. What I dislike is the way it's being marketed. Want to rewind a few weeks when bch was called Bitcoin and BTC was called a Bitcoin core on his own website? The real Bitcoin argument. I mean honestly if he would just tone it down a little and cut out the hostility it would make a lot of people feel one hell of a lot more positive including bitcoin cash supporters. Roger is a leader and a lot of people walk to his drum beat. It's up to him if he wants to be a positive one or if he wants to be a manipulative one. 
 But.... baby steps. My 100% plea to you is just focus on being positive. Focus on what's going right. From there we can look at other issues. The tribal in fighting just has to stop. It's not good for either side.

What do we think? The better question is why do you think it will crash when it's been going for nine years and only growing. 
Personally I don't see it crashing at all, in fact I see it getting substantially larger. The thing about all of the big movements we have seen. Personal computer. The internet. Things like that. At the beginning, the majority of society doubts them and sees them as a gimmick. They don't understand how it will be useful. As time goes on people come to accept it as it eventually starts making sense to them and you have a more consumer-friendly use case. The pc for example. In the early days of Dos programming, what good was that for someone? What use case did it have? You starting to see fragments of change in the 80s when you add basic games being programmed. Some of the first spreadsheets. Some actual use case situations. The general public still did not actually accept the home computer for another 10 plus years
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:34:08
Well I will say I agree with all that. I think you're right. Miners are not going to be selling Bitcoin at production cost not factoring in expenses. If the large shops hodl daily Supply is greatly reduced which will pop the price. There is an insanely strong floor around that $5,000 mark which is about the actual production cost of the most efficient facilities in the world expenses included. 
I also agree on the fundamentals being better now.
The recovery has to happen in steps and the first step is we need a higher high or at least a retest. If you look at the long chart every time we rally it's lower than the last one. That pattern needs to stop. I think you're going to see a lot more people get bullish when we finally have an end to the lower high pattern
We are very very near the end of a wedge right now and people are patiently waiting to see which way it breaks
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:17:17
You're looking at it wrong. If you're a low risk person invest percentages. If you have an extra 20k in cash put 500 to 1000 in btc and forget about it. Go conventional with the rest. If btc goes to zero you've lost very little. If it goes 10x again you have 5 to 10 grand
The long-term history of Bitcoin has always been a massive run and then a massive correction but the massive correction never undercuts the previous low. Unless we go under $1,200 that pattern is still 100% in play.

@_date: 2018-08-16 07:02:35
Eh. Maybe. I think it's more of a human emotion angle. You think about how long Bitcoin has been around and how you can look back and say gee it's so easy to make a ton of money. But not that many people really did. The emotional cycle of crypto makes most people run for the door at some point. I think that's what we see reflected in the media. They see oh my God it tanking. Genesis mining is shutting down. 800 coins are worth less than a cent.
Most of us think, thank God, when we hear about some of that. The average person thinks the industry is failing
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:44:02
Your opinion doesn't bother me at all. In fact I don't find it surprising in the least and I find it completely logical.
It's also the reason why so many people can't make it in the market. Like I have said in a couple of other replies to you if we look at the market since 2009 you have had all of these crazy events happen. Logical people that just think well if this happens maybe I should do this would have made the wrong choice at multiple turns. We have the luxury of History. We have the luxury of being able to get a feel for how this Market works. The people in 2013 did not have that and there was real fear this whole thing was going to zero. 
I think most people if they had a 70% loss would definitely think there is a problem and would definitely want to run. Back in 2008 the Dow lost around 50%. I distinctly remember people telling me it was going to continue lower and questioning if we were going to have a decade-long Great Depression. 50% losses or something the average person gets very concerned over. Me on the other hand? I went balls deep with every dollar I had. 
This is just the nature of human emotion. It's also why Wall Street firms are able to take dollars away from amateur Traders so easily. They are very aware of the emotional decision making process the average person has.
Most people are wired backwards. In December and January when the market was making high after high and going straight up you should have been terrified selling everything you had. Now when the market is holding lows and we see this $6,000 area as support it should make you greedy and want to buy.
I'm putting my money where my mouth is with all of this by the way and I'm doing it with a stock as well as crypto. Dsx. It's a Greek Shipping Company. Peaked over the $30 in 2008. It's trading $4 and change right now and I'm accumulating. I'm not going to write multiple paragraphs on why I'm doing it but if you just look at the price action it would scare the bejesus out of the average person and it's making me greedy.

@_date: 2018-08-03 22:11:44
That's actually a really good attitude to have. When you put on any trade thinking about how it's going to go wrong is generally better than hoping it will go right. 
Like I said earlier I think it is going to continue to grow and we are still in the middle of a very long trend. If that is not the case the only way it's really going to fail is with a series of negative events. Even if the lightning Network somehow stalls and does not improve that does not necessarily mean Bitcoin is going to die even though it may go flat or go down. It would really take something like the collective governments of the world Banning it entirely to really collapse the value and even then it would probably still be used by some. 
The realistic bear scenario is rooted in how emotional so many people are. Have you ever read political discussions or seen someone comment on crime. Ever notice you usually read a whole paragraph of stupid. People that are not thinking through their comments. We should kill every child molester period ever heard that one? Never mind that sex crimes are often convicted on less evidence than anything else and often on just testimony which would lead to a situation of people being killed on rumors. They don't think about that part and what I'm getting at is the same thing plays out in markets. When people start feeling really pessimistic about something the logic doesn't matter sometimes at least not for awhile. What matters is how they feel. Right now the sentiment on crypto is pretty bad. A lot of people have simply given up. If there is ever a collective moment where people decide there is no value in crypto that could be a major problem. Do I think it's likely or probable? No but it is possible
Personally I think the cat is out of the bag with cryptocurrency and there's no putting it back in
Keep learning, keep researching, watch quality people like andres annapolis. Read their books. A lot of us have a lightbulb moment at some point where it all starts to make sense even if we were doubters initially

Well it definitely wasn't sold for $0.10 to everyone and it's also what? 30% of the market. I mean Bitcoin was nearly 4,000 before this whole tether thing even started. As late as September of last year they had verified reserves on that 1:1 ratio. It's since then they have been stonewalling everyone and if they have sense they have probably been working to accumulate as much money as possible so they can call in an auditor when they are ready and say look everything is fine. That's a really big exchange and they have had ample warning that heat is coming. I mean there is an absolute ton of cash flowing in there they could use to repair the books even if they were doing Shady things in November and December. There's yet another thing I'm looking for. Insiders people like the Winklevoss twins. Mr wu from bitmain. Those guys. If there was truly a meltdown risk you would see high-volume liquidation and that's not happening right now. In fact the volume is disgustingly low. I share your concern that something is definitely not right. I just don't see any evidence for it being a world-ending scenario

Right. But that really wasn't what I was getting at. What I was getting at is on the Bitcoin network is bitmain really that small of a player? Look at the hashrate on bitcoin cash and on bitcoin. Now I know it goes without saying they are the major player on bitcoin cash. However look at that hashrate. Either bitmain is still majorly into Bitcoin or the network now is so decentralized they don't have a hope in Hell In ever pulling off this plan.

There are two main things about that article and I have read it before. Number one they actually had money in an account. That would prevent a meltdown . number 2 there's probably something we don't know. Even if your theory is true that some people were able to buy tether at massive discounts it was definitely not widespread. They also have had ample time to repair these books even if they were cooking them. Lastly it's in their best interest to stay solvent. Think about how many millions of dollars they make a year, like legitimately. Collapsing the market would not only send most of them to prison most likely it would end their Cash Cow

actually we kind of did. have you ever googled "history of gold"? also noteworthy gold didn't even become a ledger until there were societies. a currency needed to be rare. hard or impossible to fake. transportable, divisible and agreed upon. again, we are way up to societies here not a social reset scenario like nuclear war which was the theme of what i was saying. gold and silver worked because they checked all those boxes. not ironically bitcoin also does all this but it does it better. the biggest real risk to society is lack of resources. running out of oil. iron etc. this will happen but none of us alive today will live to see it. the currency chosen at that point will have to be check all the boxes at that time. maybe it will be gold? it's not something i think about because as finite as oil is, our rate of depletion is still slower than my lifespan. 
personally speaking i have 2lbs of silver sterling sitting about 40 feet away from me. i'll sell it in a minute when the price runs again. no interest in it. to me it's not a currency. bitcoin however. i'd pay for that and many people especially under 30 see it as their generations gold. 
it doesn't really matter what the ledger is, what matters is if everyone agrees on it being valuable. crypto is such an amazing example of this. look back to 2013 at some of the bitcoin forks. what was one? peercoin i think? 21m fixed supply just like bitcoin. today it's worth like 1 cent. 99.9% devaluation. people did not agree on it being valuable. litecoin however, people bought the silver argument and it's probably the best of all the forks thus it has value.

Not at all I was selling above 10,000 and started buying Under 7. It was pretty obvious that we had a correction going on but we have this area of support hovering around 6000. 
I'm not full of Doubt at all. I've actually been buying tonight. The 6,000 area has held all year and there is no real reason to believe it's going to fail with no catalyst. It's also not in the interest of a whale to dump if they are the only ones dumping if they ever plan on buying back in it will just Jack the price right back up.
There is no magic happening. There is a lack of Fiat. Collapsing markets don't make new people come to the space. The sooner people figure that out the sooner this whole thing will start to up trend again. 
If Bitcoin went to 1500 I would consider selling it all because that would not only break the entire 10 year history trend, mining would be unprofitable and the network would be completely compromised. You see all this mining equipment we have now. If it's not profitable to use it to mine it will be used for a 51% attack and the final blow. If we hit 1,500.  15 will be the next stop

The only one on that list that didn't crash is Litecoin. Also keep in mind a lot of the benefits to Litecoin didn't matter back then. There was a lot less traffic on the Bitcoin Network. Now you have Litecoin developing integration into the consumer Market. They have debit card deals with all kinds of people in the works right now. It's cheaper to send. It's also faster. It's also less encrypted but apparently that doesn't really seem to be an issue Quantum Computing aside and even on that level it's guessing. Litecoin has had more development in the past 18 months than it had in its entire life. If you're talking about price I guess the thing to do would be watch and see if it can break out of its link to bitcoin because right now they move lock step

I just made a post above this about this particular situation. Long story short most people are not cut out to be Traders. Lesson number two. You can back test Bitcoin. There is a strategy that has worked and many people refuse to use it. You simply buy your Bitcoin and you check the price once a week and don't do anything with it until you see a parabolic run. If it goes down you can always cost average in. When the market goes up five to ten times from the beginning of the year you sell or put a stop loss on. That has about a 99% success rate and it might be a hundred percent.  Now in the future it's probably going to be a 100% success rate because we are going to take out the previous highs. If you try to be a Trader on the other hand and don't have what it takes which already means  facing 90% odds. You're going to blow your account up before long. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 05:25:34
 This is exactly how markets get manipulated. If you have a Syndicate of smart people that are well-funded. You can play the emotional decision makers like a fiddle and it's working right now. It's probably the best way to clean the week hands out of holding. Smarter people can then buy up the supply and when the price starts to go up again the same people who were full of despair will start to fomo and buy. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:13:01
It's the emotional cycle. People are prime for this. I mean if you look at the order books right now there is not a lot going on on the buy-side so it's probably very easy for whales to push the price down. Each day some new person wakes up and panics and sells off their holdings. That will continue until it doesn't. 
Personally I think we are either going to get a turn in the next 30 days and start the flat period. Or this thing is going to leg down for another 6 to 9 months doing a full-blown repeat of last time. It would make absolutely no sense as the fundamentals are completely different but there are one hell of a lot of gamblers in the space and their emotions move the same directions. The fundamentals don't really matter so much when the buy and sell buttons are often emotional choices

I think a lot of us are just going to go into hibernation if that starts to play out. I already have everything in Cold Storage. I'm not Trading. Trying to get myself to just look at things less and go about my life. Trading action has been much better in equities lately and it's really good in Forex if you are familiar with that market.
Crypto is in a down cycle and unless we start going sideways soon the chance of a saucer bottom that drags out just like 2015 did starts becoming a lot more substantial
If this cycle plays out like it looks, we are going to have another rally that is lower than 8.5. Probably mid 7s. At that point a retest of 5.8 becomes extremely likely. It may not break down on the first touch but it will be loaded to go if we have yet another rally that stops in the mid sixes. When it drops from they're going to 5300 seems pretty likely. This pattern has been stair stepping down all year long and there is no indication it's going to stop right now. Every time we attempt to Rally, resistance is lower than the last one

Then what are you saying? We have had a downtrend that keeps basing in the $6,000 area all year. The only difference is the range keeps getting tighter and we keep making lower lows. All of the alts are undercutting

am i confident in the USD? as long as it's the world reserve currency yes. will it continue to inflate, absolutely however knowing that let's you plan for it. holding fiat does mean you lose money every single year with banks being the biggest profiteers. you have 10k in an account. they make interest loaning it, you get at best 25 points and yearly inflation is 2% a year give or take. you're net negative every single year

I completely agree with you on what you just said. It's possible the 1 million wallet I was referring to was fabricated for a news article. The original Satoshi wallet they called it. 
It seems like a lot of people are trying to trade every swing and that's working out for them in the long run about like it does day traders on Wall Street. 92% are net negative in the long term. There is this sense of panic when it goes against them and the sense of euphoria when they nail one correctly.

It has the potential to easily turn into one. Italy is the third largest economy in the EU. You have the world very near a recession point I mean it's been like 10 years. You have banks that are in a tightening cycle and then you have Italy. If this plays out like I'm guessing they are going to be able to delay it for awhile but Italy is going to be one of the main catalysts of the global recession as we go into the next easing cycle. The only unpredictable part is how bad the inflation will be and how many billions of dollars worth of bonds they have to give Italy to get them solvent. 
If there is talk about isolation there is no practical way to pull it off. How would they repay their obligation to the European Central Bank? An exit strategy would simply leave them with a lot of high interest bonds to try and finance their government. Greece quickly comes to mind here.

If they are why am I seeing lower highs all year long? I mean that's going to go until it doesn't and there is no real evidence that it's going to stop anytime soon. 11.7. 9.8. 8.5. I'm sure we are going to set another lower high here before long and more importantly we are squeezing the lows. That pretty much completes the wedge which means sometime before the end of October we should have a break out one way or the other. If this thing breaks bearish it's going to be a 2014-2015 repeat all over again for absolutely no reason. 
That's why I'm saying people are terrified. The news is actually really good. You had a lot of people that came to the market at the end of 2017 and now they are being driven away.

I think you're absolutely right but this current bear market is playing into their hands. It's hard to have an hour go by without someone panicking and selling. You start having thousands of people selling .1btc and you can open up a fairly substantial amount for purchase. The volume of this current sell-off has been so low you just get the feeling if smart and well-capitalized people are just sitting back waiting for everyone who expected quick gains to sell and nibbling up what they do

If everyone is playing above water the withdrawal would be very easy. I know the obvious question is what if one Exchange is playing the Wall Street in 2008 game. Volatility models and leverage on the Bitcoin they actually have. What if they have an outside lending Source giving them 2 to 1 or 5 to 1 or more on the Bitcoin they actually hold. If that happens it's literally just going to repeat the same thing that happened with housing. You will see exchanges collapse. Hopefully none of them are being that risky but you never know I guess

I'm fairly sure he does because everyone already expected the Winklevoss ETF to be rejected. The most likely theory on this current drop is that tool that got liquidated on OKC. It was just a massive position that caused a liquidity trap. 
There are five more Bitcoin ETFs in the works and the most promising is the one from the CBOE. That one people expect to be delayed. The only thing that would be bearish is an outright rejection. 
This bear Market has been going on for 8 months and there's no real catalyst showing up to drive it lower. Most of the panic sellers are already gone. Now it all hinges on more money flowing into the market

I'm just not sure how long that is going to take. There are a lot of people who have simply given up. A lot of the public are emotional people. You ever notice whenever a crime happens they have this emotional Outburst but before the crime took place they never gave it a second thought? They do the same thing with markets. It takes people months for their mind to begin to turn. Unless we get constant support from institutions Iceberging orders and giving us a horizontal Trend I think a lot of Main Street is going to just continue to dump. when the market finally turns they will be the same ones buying their same coins back at twice the price.  I'm just really not sure how low or how long that will take. We are due for a market turn in September on the long cycle. If we start getting higher lows and higher highs that's very bullish for next year. If we get a down turn testing 5300 and then bouncing off of the sixes that's bearish. We have an announcement on another no name ETF on Thursday and it might be an excuse for the shorts to Pile in again because it's very likely to be denied or delayed.
Retail buyers are simply terrified right now.

Yeah but the Bitcoin cash people aren't really interested in an open discussion. Number one they didn't get a consensus so that's that. Number 2 the majority of what happens over there is hostile. Hostile toxic people need to be censored and removed. What they do is run off the quality posters. Many of us actually enjoy rational discussions and posting your opinion is fine. Posting crazy opinions is even fine. Schilling, manipulating, generally being dishonest or aggressive is not fine. I mean they talk about censorship and all that but a lot of us in here have been banned from following Rodger on Twitter for even calling into question Bitcoin cash. Simply asking questions about some of the motives gets you banned and yet they complain about censorship.

Rigged which way? I've only seen conspiracy theory websites suggesting artificially keeping the price down but really it's up massively over the past 20 years. There was an incredible gold boom when people had genuine worry about runaway inflation. When 2008 cracked the concern was the FED would have to go to zero or negative real interest rates to prevent deflation which of course some argued would be dollar negative. When that pattern and turned out not to be the case Gold sold off. The majority of the conspiracy theories seem born in anti-government anti-fed logic. They are communicating a Feeling, not necessarily reality.

That guy is spreading fud. The entire market cap of tether is less than 2% of Bitcoin. The whole damn thing could be insolvent and it wouldn't be as bad as they make it out to be. Bitfinex also makes so damn much money off that Exchange even if there were some Shenanigans last year there's no way they're going to let it unwind completely. It would kill their Cash Cow. Like even if you assume the worst case scenario of them double spending they could easily refund that account with enough time. That's just not a happy-go-lucky scenario either it's simply more profitable
@_date: 2018-05-03 02:53:02
Totally true but really it doesn't need to replace cash and I don't think the US government would allow it simply because of the way currency and the economy is manipulated. However Bitcoin could replace pretty much everything else. PayPal Visa all of that. All of those companies now become obsolete technology. It seems to me that it would be very easy to have a BTC USD pair that is completely interchangeable with one another through all of the modern exchanges we are likely to see. You could probably even get to the point of using Bitcoin or other contract coins on vendors like eBay. I mention eBay because people or buyers are going to want some kind of reassurance they aren't getting ripped off so all of that again can be worked into the picture. I don't think the u.s. dollar is the problem I think all these payment services are what is going to go away with the move to crypto. However when that happens you guys know these giant swings in whatever token/coin is use are probably not going to exist anymore

how worried are you guys about this tether situation with bitfinex. i'm not sure if it's just rumors or guessing or even what the difference is between those two words but the chatter about regulators looking into things then the possibility they are playing bitfinex-fed2.0 printing their own tether without the same amount of usd to back it up. this makes tether a bitcoin funnel and mtgox 2.0 a possibility if the worst theories are true {not a fud comment. general curiosity}

Maybe. I mean think about why gold was valuable in the first place. It was very rare. It's kind of cool looking. It was a durable Ledger system. It's almost impossible to predict if Humanity would go the same direction again. I mean look at how Bitcoin caught on. 99% or more of the public had no idea this was going to happen. They really are just now starting to understand the idea behind store value and so on. It's the same reason certain comic books cost $100,000 and others are $0.05. If there was an apocalypse and the entire Village agreed gold was going to be there Ledger system it would have great value but if the tribe across the river did not like gold where does that leave you?
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:00:57
What chart are you looking at. Start of 2013 was like 20. Start of 2017 was around 1000. Making up numbers doesn't make an argument. Bitcoin was never 200 in 2017 in fact the only time it was was during what you could call the crypto recession of 2014-2015. Now if we are just going to grab random numbers from random years we might as well go back to 2009 when Bitcoin was trading at a fraction of a Cent and compare that to the $1,000 price in 2013. 
What I see is the big change today is there is a huge difference in the type of person interested in Bitcoin. It's no longer just criminals and anarchists and alt libertarian types. I think this might be a big part of the reason for the push back. You now have big bankers. Liberals. Common people. Completely different crowd and this wouldn't be the first time a crowd rotation in a sector has happened. 
As far as volatility settling down. Yes it does appear to be heading that way and it's a great thing. You're never going to have wide adoption as a currency with hundred percent swings in a month. Not even as a store of value and those are currently the two arguments of what Bitcoin is. If someone is looking for speculative assets to gamble there are plenty of altcoins. Be happy about this. Be happy Bitcoin is maturing because it's what allows things like those altcoins to flourish

So far so good. The rough alts are dying. When we get a good rally Bitcoin will go up and you can tell which alts also still have support because they also rally. The majority of them are not. We go through these Bitcoin short Cycles and the alts keep grinding lower
You know what is really cool about this capitulation movement we have going on? Cloud mining is going to die. It was a scam anyway. Lazy people making money off someone else. Project token bullshit coins are going to die. They have no real world use case. 
The big question I have on this cycle is are we going to see eth etc and XMR make it? In 2013 only Litecoin was left standing and I'm sure it will be again. I'm thinking there will probably be a small handful that will also be left and those three above are where I would bet but there's no telling how low they will grind.

even the shady plug on rogers site when btc was called bitcoin core and bch just bitcoin. the legos are starting to really interlock in my head

You have any ideas looking forward on that? The one that seems obvious to me is in 2017 you had a major Market move up. That naturally is going to free up a lot of coins because people are going to sell on the way up. In a declining market like the one we have now you get some volume at first but eventually you run into the strong hands. People that just aren't going to sell. As you point out when you start seeing Bart Simpson patterns on 5-minute charts there's not a lot of volume there. I strongly suspect the volume will return When the price increases. First at $10,000 you will have some people leaving. Those coins will come to Market. a second group at 11 7. Another around 15. Lastly you're going to have a very large group around 20,000. When I look at the entire picture of Bitcoin from 2009 and realize how this asset class works it really doesn't matter to a Trader if they buy .1 Bitcoin or 1 Bitcoin. Money is Money And Trades are trades. Now to a long-term holder there is an enormous difference . a tenfold difference. The trader on the other hand doesn't really care if Bitcoin is $2,000 or $20,000 or $200,000. The higher that price goes the more liquid the market is going to become. You're going to fish people out of their Holdings and you will not have gigantic swings in price to the same degree. The market will simply become more liquid. 7500 many of us now feel is a very low price and as long as we continue to feel that way there is no reason to sell. In fact there is a reason to accumulate. Looking at chart history I believe that psychology has played out for the past 8 years or more. I don't really see any reason for it to stop. In fact if I had to guess I think we will try and mostly sideways while we are waiting for the SEC and some clarity. Beings money tends to drive laws I suspect there is a much better than average chance at least the top traded coins are going to have a favorable ruling. They will probably be rather harsh on some of the garbage alt coins. At that point it's a green light for institutions and large money investors. The next run will begin and liquidity will quickly increase as that price goes up

Crowd behavior at its finest. When things are going up people will buy and buy and buy. Doesn't matter what the price is because it will be more tomorrow.
Now everyone is terrified. The stupid people are saying Bitcoin will be $1,500 or whatever ridiculous number they pull out of their ass. I wonder if we are going to get Bitcoin will be a million on the next cycle from the same people? Or same type of people I should say
I still think lack of Fiat is the biggest problem. You had all these people that ran up their credit cards and took out a second on their house in 2017. I don't think the problem is the price needs to be lower I think the problem is we need to have more people come to the space that actually have Fiat. The Catch-22 obviously is most of those people just Chase. Once the trend is already in play they will come around. Where is the real reversal event going to come from? Because it certainly isn't news. It's been overwhelmingly positive and people sell into the face of it. This recent one being one of the most ridiculous. Selling an expected event

Personally I think it's still a technical correction. I've spent the past week researching pretty heavy on bitcoin over the past few years. The one conclusion I came to is people have absolutely no idea what the price is going to do. Just last year when the price began to run there were all of these sell articles and comments about 3,000. Oh my gosh it made a huge run get out get out. Now that happened all the way to 20,000 but it happened a lot less in the last $10,000. The human mind is genetically programmed to spot patterns. It could be something hereditary. Who knows but we all do it. That's useful with some things but with markets it creates a bias. The price run in 2017 to $3,000 was probably the most fearful of all. The correction that happened later that year also sparked a ton of fear. Why that earlier run was so important is because it came off of a reasonable bear Market where the price didn't really do anything so when the price began to behave differently people literally panicked. If you have the time study a lot of the posts on bitcointalk and online and go back a few years. The most interesting part of all is the crowd was most often wrong. They were fearful when they should have been greedy and greedy when they should have been fearful. When I look out the window right now in the crypto Market you know what I see? A ton of fear.

@_date: 2018-08-08 20:06:50
There are definitely issues. That's what allows the appreciation. If everything was perfect you would probably have a fully valued product. 
Go read a few hours worth of posts from 2014 and 2015. We are more negative now than they were then. If you see this forum as optimism you're setting the bar way too low. You will never see a point where everyone just hates Bitcoin. You will never see a point where everyone is pessimistic. Bitcoin could be at $5 and you will not see that. Historically sentiment is worse now than I have been able to research at any point in history going back to 2013. There was a brief period when Mount gox blew up that was worse but that quickly subsided to a more rational level of despair similar to what we have now. 
This myth that everyone needs to hate Bitcoin before it will go up is just ridiculous. More money coming to the market is what makes Bitcoin go up. Step one is just not undercutting the lows and so far we haven't. The 6,000 area of support continues to hold give or take a few hundred dollars. If that breaks you may get your final capitulation and allow people to feel comfortable which I think is the real reason we might capitulate. If that doesn't happen we will Trace out a flat bottom like we have been appearing to do since April. Eventually this pattern of lower highs is going to break and we are in a really tight range right now. We now have an 8500 resistance and 5700 support. One of these numbers is going to go. If its 57 then 53 is the next stop and if its 85 then 98 is likely the next stop. Even a return to 85 I would consider positive because at least then we would have sideways action. 
Out of all of the sell offs we have had this year the one right now I feel is the most ridiculous and unwarranted. People are pointing at the delay of the Bitcoin ETF as the reason which is just downright insane. Everyone knew it was going to be delayed. That is not news that was an expected event. What I think it is is more of a game of chicken. People are selling to see if other people sell. If those people sell the price keeps dropping and dropping and then it's going to be a game of who jumps in first. 
It's just ridiculous gambling idiots  coupled with a very low flow of Fiat into the market. I was just looking at the Etherium Classic Market on coinbase. Normally you would get a pop on such an event. Normally you would have a lot of buyers. Right now the buy side is low. People are sitting on their hands waiting for this to all be over. It doesn't matter if the bear market ends in a week or a year. People are still going to be hanging out until things normalize. Right now it's Traders fighting each other over scraps

How is it a copy of 2013? We did not have Marcus and Wiley in 2017. We did not have Mount gox blow up this year
Even after all of the blatant manipulation in 2013 and the exchange exploding in 2014 we had the Bitcoin price of $20 at the beginning of 2013. Do one run up . and then go up to a manipulated $1,200 before crashing to roughly $200 which is 10 x where the run started. That was the longest of any bear market since Bitcoin was born and had very fundamental reasons. Right now this is the second longest bear Market in Bitcoin history and has no fundamental reasons. The dumb money was punished months ago. We are eight months into a bear market with no reason for existing at this point in time
The problem right now is there is an overall lack of Fiat flowing to the market. The coinmarketcap keeps dropping. Traders are sloshing dollar amounts up and down but the overall market cap keeps shrinking

You get mixed responses from conventional Finance people . on the one hand you have open minds. Goldman Sachs is going to open a trading desk . on the other you have Warren Buffett types who believe it is all speculative gambling. And really if you look around, especially at people who are into sub 1 dollar alt coins. The speculative gambling argument is pretty strong. Bitcoin still is not a mature product so it's normal for a lot of people not trust it. The crypto mentality or the fanatical arguments some people make could potentially be another turn off.  Yet another might be there is no conventional way to really value it. If I look at most any stock I can see how much money the company is making. I can see what their price-to-earning ratio is . I can see how much debt they carry. With Bitcoin the argument is finite Supply. Store of value. Potentially a large scale digital Cash System. Lightning Network pending. The only conventional product that even is one iota close to this is gold. It's hard for a lot of people to wrap their head around.

This honestly doesn't surprise me. in fact I might be conversing with one in another thread on here. It's a six-day-old Reddit account and he seems very knowledgeable about the crypto space. 
My reply was also very similar to what you just said. Roger is a big part of what got me into crypto but this current manipulative practice I can't support. Remember a couple weeks ago when bch was called Bitcoin on his domain and BTC was Bitcoin core? Stuff like that. I said if they wanted to improve their project they need to focus on positive development not just anti btc rhetoric . The hostility and the slandering is definitely going to irritate a lot of us but more importantly it's not going to do anything good for them. Curiously one of the most intelligent people on the Bitcoin cash side. Mr bitmain himself Wu made a recent tweet singing a very similar song about positive development and coexisting. 
My big problem with all the in fighting is I think it destroys the brand. It destroys public Trust. It makes newcomers think twice.
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:40:27
So you got me really curious and I started looking into the statistics. I'm not sure how far back you went back testing this but looking at various points in the market and some of the data you can get on bfx data along with just old articles there are a few peculiar things . November 2017 had an outrageously High number of shorts. They got absolutely ran in the ground in December. Mid 2015 and late 2015 had a lot of shorts. That's right when the run-up started. There's a pretty good argument for this being a contrary indicator looking at history. What sucks is I can't find any recent history. I'm looking at bfx data but a lot of the site appears to be down. Did you see any date profile on that 35000 number you mentioned? The only data I'm finding in hard facts ends mid April 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:27:14
Yeah I mean that's where Im at too. I'm just slightly more nervous than usual because we are at the very end of the yearly technical wedge. Somewhere around September if we keep doing what we have been we're going to be squeezed into a range with a mandatory break One Direction or the other. There's a really good chance it's going to be a solid brake and it could go either way. The nervous part of me is looking at the ETF on September 30th as being the catalyst. If this lower high pattern continues we're going to Rally up again into the mid 7s. Then drift. Test support and at that point there is basically nowhere to go. You have support and resistance in a $1,000ish range. People are going to be looking very closely at what happens next
@_date: 2018-08-16 03:58:48
I don't know man I mean think this out. If someone got 5 Bitcoins at 6000 they are in that 30 grand. If we get to 80 to 100 thousand in the next 5 years that's enough money to have a life change.

Reminds me of what blew up housing in 2008. You had loans being given to people who obviously could not repay them while the banks speculated with leveraged derivatives going only in one direction . The volatility models could not handle a very wide swing  and when that swing happened  they popped one after another. This actually all makes sense now because I remember reading the comment more than once that $1 in Fiat equaled something like $20 in crypto which didn't really make sense at the time and now it totally does. This also doesn't necessarily mean the market is going to crash but it does greatly amplify the swings that it is going to have. Unlike the banks I would imagine these exchanges are quickly closing people's trades if they get in over their head. The real risk I see is if any of these exchanges do the same thing those Wall Street Banks did with housing. If one of these exchanges is lending more than it actually has and the trades go against them it could collapse The Exchange

You have no idea how much of that is hedging, day trading, really anything. High volume does not necessarily mean high fraud. In fact you can reasonably conclude with what the market cap of tether is a lot of that trading is already heavily in Bitcoin and just shifts back and forth.

Crypto by nature is anti-inflation or you could even argue deflationary. Bitcoin for example is capped at 21 million coins and there are probably no more than 17 million that will ever be. We have simply had so many losses over the years. Fiat money inflates at at least 2% a year on average.

I think the bottom line is if more people feel like you do this whole project will collapse. Pessimism will Doom everything it touches. This project can very easily succeed in one of two ways. One is a store of value and the other is a digital Cash System. In order for number 2 to happen the value of each coin has to be a hell of a lot higher than it is. That will draw in more investment and more development . regulation absolutely has to happen. If we continue in this death spiral it's likely you're going to read a news article that Goldman Sachs changed their mind about setting up a crypto desk. You're going to see the 200-plus hedge funds start to close up. Then it might be a race for the door between the big money investors like the Winklevoss twins. If that happens the project is over. But it doesn't have to go that way. Development can continue. People are worried about how the regulations are going to go right now. You also have the question on when the lightning network is going to be fully operational and out of the beta phase. You don't even really need a firm date on that you just need progress to continue to happen. Personally I really want to see this project succeed. I love the idea behind it.

That's not going to happen in the United States but there is a lot of risk in Italy. The European Central Bank is going to step in to save them and there are a couple of ways they can do it. All of them I can think of are inflationary. If you guys have a stock ticker list on your phone you might want to add gold or gld. It's something to keep an eye on as the situation develops. If people start seeing this as long-term the price of gold is going to Rally. Right now a lot of the money went into us treasuries which doesn't really tell anyone very much because you can pull it out of there in a Split Second. It could just be a short-term concern while they figure out a plan to deal with Italy
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:33:49
the reason i don't like statements like this is  yes in dollars it was the largest increase ever. however in percentage it was less than half of 2013. i do however agree with your overall thesis on volatility. it will tame over time although i'm not sure it will happen so quickly. if bitcoin is going to stick around long term the price has to go higher. much higher.

That's excellent actually. The peer-to-peer lending and tight margin requirements. It keeps the market from blowing up based on a couple of players.

i agree with most of the comments in here. the argument for a 2014 repeat is very strong right now. we may not have a full 80% drawdown like 2014 did but the psychology is similar all those people who bought at 500-1000 in 2013 got wrecked when it fell to 200. we can backtest that cycle and see it took nearly 18 months from the peak for a real uptrend to take hold. the argument that the market is much different today is true. the thing is. the human minds behind it are not. people have emotional reactions to loss. that may be what drags this market out in a horizontal bottom scrape for the rest of the year and possibly part of next.  by summer 19 the litecoin halving will take place and bitcoin the following year. this should be wildly bullish but again....18 months from the  2017 peak before we run into the litecoin event and another year for BTC. start adding things up like halving, SEC regs by then, new crop of people or the same people who have worked through their loss and you setup for a major uptrend into 2020. what would be even more wild and this is just my own speculation is if a pattern emerges. 2013 had a 5000% run up and 80% peak loss. 2017 had a 2000% run up and so far a 70% peak loss. 2020 if the pattern holds will have a 1000% run up. if 2018 plays out like 2014 we are going to go mostly horizontal for the next 12 months and could have a mid to end 2019 price of 6000-10,000. if 2020 goes on a tear in the same cycle at the same drop in percentage you have a 60,000 to 100k price target on the next run

It depends on the extent of how bad things are. That exchange has a lot of money the question is do they have enough to cover their obligation. I mean even if we assume the worst is true I don't see how this Compares with mount gox. That exchange was straight-up burglarized and collapsed. With bitfinex the worst case scenario appears to be a few people going to prison and confidence shaken along with a potential forced liquidation from the exchanges assets.. The thing is Bitcoin was around 3 to $4,000 before all of this began. We're coming up on one more year of growth. A lot of new people to the space. If anything to me that explains why we are at 7500. People are already nervous. Granted it may fall further if all this comes out in a news article but undercutting the price before all this began? Not even Mount gox did that. The parallel to 2014 however would be blatantly obvious

I don't really think the number is that important but what you said is definitely it with the psychology. I mean we're already seeing volume dry up. Strong hands are holding more of the coins each year that goes by. In order for liquidity to increase the price actually has to go up. As you point out each one of those bear markets was different and realistically you can't fundamentally say there was a cause for each one making it the percentage that it was. People act irrationally. I'm really not sure what to think with the price because it seems like everytime someone calls out alone number like 2000 or 3000 what it translates to is they want it to go down that low so they can buy more. That's not really bearish. It's a closet Bull. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:57:06
oh you're absolutely right. that's one reason i got into bitcoin. the fiat game is absolutely rigged for the elite just like the trump tax plan. i'm not sure about you but i have my own inflation indexes i look at along with the published ones. one of them is the campbell's soup index. a can of veg beef soup was 89-99 cents in 2000-2002. it averages $1.99 now. 100% increase. the price of a house in my neighborhood built in 1985 was around $129 in 2000, same house. $360k today. wages on the other hand. best case most are up 40-50% putting people net negative on food and housing. there are some things that are cheaper. blu ray players, movies, car stereos. some nick nacks are less but the big stuff. everything is more expensive, everything. even the price of the average new car is up at least the same as wages.

Yeah I've definitely noticed that. What exactly is the difference between Bitcoin cash and Litecoin by the way? Because when I look at the fundamentals of it I see sha256 vs scrypt and a 4x larger supply on ltc. They both had the idea of larger block size and more of a cash transaction coin. The part I found surprising again fairly new here is that it appears Bitcoin split. The Bitcoin cash people attempted to take over Bitcoin but did not get a consensus so they forked off on their own. I guess I don't understand why they just didn't support Litecoin and build on that. It was already there and established and pretty much right down the alley of where they went. Like that's my current area of study actually. I'm trying to figure out what's really different between those two. There's an obvious difference in management style right now with Charlie Lee being more of the liberal intellectual easy to get along with type. I like where Charlie is going with his vision and definitely support that. I like where Bitcoin is going and I definitely support that. Bitcoin cash I'm trying to  wrap my head around.

And it's one that I find has a little weight to it period in the early days of web design everything was HTML and then we had HTML 2 and 3 and now 5 and so on. WordPress came along and gave people who did not want to learn coding the ability to create a decent website that was still more technical than a cut and paste but not quite as technical as writing everything from code. You can still edit CSS and you can still run apps on top of Wordpress and do a lot of what you can in HTML. That mirrors what etherium is doing right now with token design. The one that really stands out to me is icon or icx. If you don't live in South Korea which I definitely don't you don't see it in action but if you do some research look at what that silly little token is doing. It's taking development in pretty cool direction that actually has real world use. If eth is responsible for projects like this and many others it literally is the WordPress equivalent. Personally speaking I like this kind of development and think it's healthy for the market. The coin I would be critical of is Bitcoin cash. It feels like they are trying to Rebrand the Bitcoin name on to their coin. Technically it's very similar to Litecoin which oddly enough the founders of Bitcoin cash did not back. I'm not quite as bearish on bitcoin cash as some of you but the only reason why is because I would encourage them to develop the coin into itself . to make it stand on its own two feet. If their entire goal is simply trying to take over the Bitcoin name I don't see how they plan to ever succeed. They did not receive a majority vote which is why they forked in the first place. In fact the only real shot seems to be drying up the supply and then betting big with a pump to run the price and hope people fomo and jump on board. If the management at Bitcoin cash simply said hey look we disagree with where Bitcoin was going and we decided to make our own coin based on what we feel are the merits of Bitcoin. I would totally cheer them on. I might question why they didn't just support Litecoin but that's another argument. However it would be honest and transparent. When I read a lot of the current marketing about Bitcoin cash however it's very angry. They are crying about censorship and how they are the oppressed little person. Yet they are trying for a hostile takeover of Bitcoin. I mean what do they really expect

@_date: 2018-08-04 07:20:42
Alright so there are a couple of things going on here. The first one you have to be aware of or the cycles. You can see this if you look at a 10-year history of the company. Imagine an oscillator. That's how this stock trades. There is something called the Baltic dry index which in layman's terms is what they can charge for shipping. The higher that goes the higher the day rate becomes on the ships. Now if you look at the really big picture on the Baltic dry index in 2016 it bottomed at a lower level than it was trading in the 90s. During the last major cycle which was 2003 to 2009 metals and bulk shipping did really well because China was clicking off at 10% GDP every year. Same with the Emerging Markets. That all crashed along with the housing crisis and a lot of these shipping companies had ships they could not pay for and no one wanting to Charter them. You look at the earnings of a couple of the good names like DSX and ssw and you see them burning money. They were not making any profit. Now back to that Baltic dry index. If you look at 2016 until today you see that series of higher lows. Now you look at the earnings of DSX they went from losing ass loads of money to breaking even with a small profit on this last earnings report. Now you look at the share price. We had to run up to a little over $5 and now we are correcting back down. You have a company with improving earnings and a share price that hasn't really caught on yet. Where is the risk? It's in the macro. If we have a recession or if we have drastically slowing Global growth it could be a negative. However it's extremely unlikely we are going to get anywhere near 2016 levels again. A lot of the ships and over supply have been scrapped or sold. When you look at the rest of Wall Street and some of the high earnings multiples on companies that have been doing well for years I just don't really see the value. I mean people are paying 17 times earnings for Heinz. Yes like ketchup. What I'm doing in a nutshell with DSX is selling parabolic rallies and buying support. The level we are at right now I'm nibbling. I'm not 100% sure if I would say this is a bottom because we don't have any signs of it but again if we look at that chart you see that run up off of a clear double bottom. Now we have the correction. It might do a Fibonacci retracements or it might just be a regular Cup &amp; handle retracement before the next stage takes off. What we don't want to see is the price get back down into the mid 3s. That would be full circle. If we go down to $4 flat to where we are now that is just a good healthy correction. Again the risk is macro. If we have slowing GDP into the back half of the year which is a pretty reasonable possibility it could put a limit on this particular stock but then again a nice horizontal trend is really easy to trade. If you look at the macd right now you will see the histogram trading up which is a bullish Divergence couple that in with the price action and where we are on the oscillator. It just seems like a reasonable time to accumulate a little more so I bought another hundred shares this morning and will keep watching the price action. The worst case scenario is stopping out about 3.90 or cost averaging in the whole way down and waiting for the next cycle. When China starts to accelerate again this thing could really go to town because dry bulk shipping is things like iron ore. Copper etc

So 15 minutes later and looking at the numbers I see what you're talking about. There's almost certainly a gigantic amount of stops around 6500 and probably a wave from where we are going down to that. If this thing were to begin to liquidate it would seriously create a wave with a hard fall through 6500 as those stops blow up. I had never noticed that exchange before, probably because I've never thought of margin trading. They have a lot of volume there. How delayed is the data they release on positions ?
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:48:02
Look around . People are panicking and the gamblers are leaving. The worst retrace Bitcoin ever had was in 2014 and that was 80% Peak to trough. We have had a 70% retrace already happen. A repeat of 2014 would put us down in the 4s. There is no logical or technical argument for that happening but it doesn't mean that it won't. It's quite possible 2018 will be an extended bottoming process. You need a lot of people to give up. When that happens and the price cannot be pushed any lower you're going to see a lot of confidence with the stronger hands. Right now I think they are hunting to see if 6500 is truly the bottom
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:02:02
There's actually a legitimate non conspiracy theory possibility about that in 2017 as well. It basically goes that hedge funds started buying tons and tons of Bitcoins driving the price up because they knew the CME futures were going to go live in dec. At that point they can take a lot of short Futures contracts and dump their Bitcoins at Key technical levels to make the charts look very bearish

I'll share a couple of the reasons I think it's hal. Number one the Satoshi communication stopped about the time Hal began experiencing problems from Lou Gehrig's Disease and stepped back himself. Number 2 there are a couple of wallets and one gigantic one that have not moved. The original Satoshi wallet. A million Bitcoins.

there really is no trolling in r/btc. none that i have seen. the only thing i notice is if someone not in the tribe goes over there you guys flip the hell out and go native on them. literally...how do you expect to bring in new people if you're this scared of everyone? everyone is a troll. everyone is a shill. i mean. it's a religious war to you guys over there and you don't even realize all that is doing is harming your own cause. 
occasionally i'm sure a kid goes over and bcashes it up just to get a response but seriously. you make it so easy for those types to do it when flip out on even very reasonable posters. 
i know there are a couple of you doing the majority of the replies likely on different accounts. the words choice and sentence structure is just too similar. seriously. think about what you're doing and really ask yourself what other business has succeeded with these views? when apple was concerned with going after microsoft they did terrible. when apple started focusing on being apple they completely transformed. if you guys are going to do that you NEED smart positive people because r/btc now is a pool of negativity and hate

true, but they track the underlying asset. there was a story that broke earlier about..well...quite legal manipulation. 2017 was already bullish and more than a few people loaded up. hedge funds. big money investors. when the cme futures went active and you could short without risking the bitfinex casino they did just that. then dumped the actual bitcoins they held creating the downturn. there's no real way to obviously verify this but it does make sense. pantera {a hedge fund in crypto} returned 25,000% since it started trading crypto in 2013

i don't think some of you guys really get how fiat works and the link to GDP and forex. i'm reading this comments about fiat falling, greatly expanded monetary supply etc. historically if inflation begins to run the fed will prioritize that over growth. that situation may come to the front again with the ridiculous trump tax plan implemented at the wrong time. after the oil crisis of the 70s we had stagflation and paul vlocker literally broke the back of the inflationary trend by taking rates high. much higher than anything we could imagine today. this paved the way for reaganomics. today the massive excess in gov spending coupled with moderate growth is putting a slow squeeze on inflation. this worked in the early obama years post crash but is a terrible idea in a thriving economy which we currently have. what's likely to happen before 2022 is not a weakening in fiat. it's a recession with higher rates as the fed defends the dollar. if the fed were to allow inflation to run growth could maintain longer but the poor would be especially hard hit as the purchasing power of each dollar erodes that much faster. all hard assets would rise. this scenario is historically unlikely.

Do you mean like if insiders were able to buy usdt for $0.10 each? I suppose anything is possible in an unregulated Market. I still don't see how you figure the price will collapse though because when Mount gox actually did collapse and all those Bitcoins were actually stolen the price still didn't collapse it merely dropped from 1000 to 200 which is an 80% drawdown. We already had a 70% draw down with the $6,000 bottom. 80% puts us at 4000. I realize a lot of people use tether to buy Bitcoin but someone holds those keys so worst case scenario if things are like that what you had was a lot of theft. Someone owns those Bitcoins. Back in September of 2017 they actually did have a one-to-one ratio from what's been printed. I have no idea I guess we just have to wait and see because there's just not enough evidence to come to a rational conclusion. Is there stuff we don't know? Probably. Do we have any idea what it is? You also have to wonder how much of this is already baked into the market price because we fell in January pretty hard and no one is really sure why. One thing that has been bouncing around in my head is the people at bitfinex really don't have any interest in prison and have been unwinding all this. That's why the drop has been so substantial.

Even when we do you're still green as hell when you start trading. I read a virtual library on Stocks. Markets. Finance. Had an internship at a local broker when I was younger and a free ride to a series 7 until I blew that staying out way too late with really slutty girls. I was around professionals with an education and still blew up my first trading account. You seriously just have to jump in feet first and learn along the way. If you're going to be a Trader realize about 9 out of 10 don't make it in the long term. If we look at the Bitcoin Market you can back test with the most successful strategy is. It's obvious. Do you know what it is? Think for a minute. Yeah that's right buy some Bitcoin and forget about it. Watch the market every week or so and when you see a parabolic run of at least five to ten times the beginning of the year sell it or damn well put a stop loss on the order. You'll never figure out where the top is unless you just get dumb lucky like Charlie Lee or unless someone tipped him off to a massive sell coming but I really doubt that because he had a massive sell himself. Anyway not to get sidetracked but that is the strategy that has worked. 9 out of 10 short-term Traders don't make it in the traditional markets past 5 years. In fact most don't make it past 6 months. What kills them is the mental fatigue.

No it really didn't. The area of support has held for three times now and might be four. Every time we get down around $6,000 give or take a few hundred bucks it has been holding. If your a noob that thinks technical analysis is down to the dollar I suppose you might feel that the last time was lower but it is still in the same area of support and not only that it did not stay there long. This was the same thing that was going on in 2014 around that 200 to $250 level. There was a final capitulation event for a period of a couple days that went down to a hundred and sixty I think it was early 2015. We may have an event like that going to 4800 or 5000 but it's probably going to be very quick and have a violent turn upwards
I'm definitely not discounting some kind of capitulation event as a lot of people who are looking to buy are just sitting on the sidelines letting the short sellers get on top of each other and do their thing right now.

Do you own any Bitcoin and if so why because the argument for doing so doesn't really make sense to me if you have these kinds of feelings about gold.

Who knows? The thing about crowd psychology is if everyone is expecting a retest of 6500 people are going to start buying a little bit higher. Probably 6800 to 7200. That doesn't necessarily mean it will happen though. It's completely possible that we have a break of 6500 and then you look to see how the market reacts to that.

And the market drops. I mean the bottom line is money keeps flowing out of crypto.
This is just such a ridiculously stupid way to draw in new people
We already are at the second longest bear Market in crypto history. Unlike the longest bear Market in crypto history that had actual fundamental events and actual fear and an actual reason this one has none of the above. 
Like why in the hell are so many people dumping at such low prices. The only thing we have done now is cement in yet another lower high. Starting to run out of room. Now we have this really narrow range between 5700 and 8500 and one of those numbers is going to break before the end of the year. At least the odds of it are really good

completely agree and i have found substantial evidence to support your post. 
it's also why i don't expect a fast recovery. this cycle needs a bit of time to play out and as you correctly point out, it isn't about dollar amounts it's about actual bitcoins. a sideways market that pushes out all the gamblers and shakes the low hanging fruit is far better than a recovery where everyone and their grandmother starts buying

true. however, IF, and i know this is a big IF, wages keep pace you really haven't moved. it does give people the illusion of wealth which is a social positive. some of you may wonder why we are into bitcoin if we respect the fed and fiat system. here's why. the USD is the world reserve. it's intertwined in absolutely everything. the system can inflate to infinity if need be. however, you can't use USD in sudan. there are no chase branches. fees are also really high to send usd across the world and get higher than larger the dollar amounts get. bitcoin has a real use here and the other side of it is store of value. if society as a whole sees bitcoin the same as they do gold you literally have digital gold. i don't see bitcoin as a challenger to the USD i see it as a supplement to it. lastly. for you abolish the fed types. think this out. if you go straight ron paul and do so your job is gone, unions, gone, a depression on a scale you can't imagine. your actual quality of life is affected. all of this because you don't like a centralized inflationary currency? why not keep that as it is and build in work arounds? you know....like we are....with bitcoin. also note, if we woke up and the price of BTC was 20k usd how many of you would sell? ah ha, i see some hands going up. now it's at 40k, more hands go up, 100k, most of us are out. we just traded a decentralized deflationary currency for fiat. we wouldn't do that for zimbabwe dollars. nope . so as much as people complain about the usd nearly all of you trust it, even if you don't want to admit it.

It's also something that went away and can't really come back until you address things like. Hospital costs. Malpractice insurance. Pharmaceutical companies making hundreds of thousands of percent profit. The fact you can buy certain drugs in India for $50 that are thousands of dollars here. These companies exploit America because they can. If you simply legislate against them you give them incentive to move somewhere else. That's been the entire problem we have faced in the past 20 years and it's only getting worse. So far the best modern world example has been in Australia. It's a mix of socialized and private medicine that is better than what we currently have in America. If you're well off you can still buy the best Healthcare and if you're poor you still have something. This is all done at a lesser cost than what is currently happening in America and for better performance

Yes. Why would they be? They can simply turn off the power and buy Bitcoin on an exchange for less money if things go to that point. We already are at the shutdown price for some people. Between 3 and $4,000 is the Red Line in the Sand. Get down around there and you could start seeing problems.
 The network itself can adjust. The problem is all the old used mining equipment out there. You will be able to 51% attack altcoins for virtually nothing
Now if that happens it's going to really really harm the image of crypto to the General Public. It will be seen as far more risky than it is right now

It doesn't have to stay that way and that's what I was getting at. Especially if you look at some of the contract coins. You can keep Bitcoin as it is and use an exchange kind of like escrow for fraud protection in person to person deals like on eBay.

I'm not sure anyone except the most extremely emotional people are arguing for that (the end) This is the bear market. Arguing we're going to have another bear market is kind of like arguing housing was going to crash in 2009-2010. It already crashed. However it didn't stop people from panicking only to watch prices start to rise a year later. It's somewhat hard to make a fundamental review of Bitcoin because so many events have happened in the past that made those chart patterns happen. Mt gox etc. This current one seems to be people who expected to get rich quick selling off because nothing happened in a couple months. Well there's also the tether fiasco but I think we pretty much already worked through that. I'm looking at this from a market psychology angle . in December and January everyone thought there was no end in sight. People feel exactly the same way right now if you read a lot of comments it's just in reverse. These huge Extremes in Psychology are usually found in Market tops and bottoms. I just don't see a lot of evidence for a fast recovery and by fast I mean in the year 2018. I would be very surprised if we break 11.7 and maintain it. If the end was really here we would see bitmain liquidating and the Winklevoss twins getting out. Real high volume selling. There is not even a shred of evidence of that. If anything they are doing the same thing we are and that is waiting for all the speculators and gamblers to sell off what they have so we can buy it on sale

Some people who apparently don't comment and don't want to make their opinions known feel that everything is fine? This is probably the most bizarre reaction I have gotten to a comment in this entire subreddit. I mean the most peculiar part is the fact they keep pushing away auditors.

The tether issue is indeed a serious one but if you back test to 2013 and look at blatant manipulation with Marcus and Wiley Bitcoin was at $100 before the Run began. It peaked at 1000 and mount gox blew up. We had an 18-month bear Market but the price never went under $200 which is twice what it was before the run-up began. To say you expect Bitcoin to go to $2,000 not only says that you believe that situation is as bad as mt gox which it definitely is not but it also overlooks all the new people that have came into crypto. There are thousands if not millions of new people in crypto just in the past 24 months. That's a lot of money they have brought into this sector

@_date: 2018-05-19 21:34:40
I think the majority in the crypto market are what I would call selective Libertarians. Anti bank or anti-establishment might be a better term. A true libertarian wants deregulation and an open economy which would collapse the lives of many of the people wishing for such a thing. Are you a union worker? Yep your wages will go down. Do you get any kind of subsidized Health Care? Don't even have to explain what will happen here. What about social security what about the police department what about the fire department. So what I'm getting at if you haven't figured it out by now is most people who claim to be Libertarians are just disenfranchised with the two main political parties and I really can't blame them there. The Democrat Party  which should be the working party has a lot of special interest influence. The Republican party which should be the big business pro growth party has been taken over by a lot of vile fear mongers. I really can't blame somebody for being disenfranchised with our current climate

What does that have to do with the past couple days? That's always done transparently when they announce a bond buy? Are you by chance a conspiracy theorist? Alt libertarian type maybe?
I mean if you are there's no point in the discussion because you guys live in your own world. If you're not how are you not seeing the evidence of what's going on? 
Do you seriously think the FED made billions of dollars leave Italy and come to u.s. bonds ? Rewind back to conspiracy theorist if so

I have the same suspicion and with an unregulated Market it would be highly possible. I guess we will see you tomorrow. Running in the record high shorts also could be part of the strategy. The drop in short interest from that candle is actually pretty small. There are a lot and I mean a lot more shorts to go

Lol point taken though. I've spent the past 3 hours doing research on this and I see why some of the old-timers kind of blow it off. this has literally been going on for over 5 years. Maybe something will happen. Maybe it won't. In fact the odds are it probably won't because bitfinex has had ample time to get everything straight so it's not at all a direct correlation to mount gox which had major problems the first of which was mismanagement.

i could do the math but i know off the top of my head longer term. in 1950 a dollar is the same as a ten today. however. the average wage is up a LOT as well. as we were speaking about above. since 2000 we have had more inflation than wage growth when you look at actual objects. for people who make under 100k a year this is staring at you in the face every day. the price of fuel being a big BIG one. it was around $1 usd in the 80s. $1 to 1.50 all through the 90s. by the mid 2000s major supply shock. people begin to comprehend only so much is left in the ground. $4 price spike. real estate is on a tear....wages however....stagnant

agree. you know what i think his endgame is? running the price of bch to or above btc. they have a burn pile for a percentage of the mining. bitmain is the main network for the coin. besides a small float in the wild i wonder how much is owned by the bch empire? with a small enough float it won't take a lot of fiat to make that price run. all they have to do is pump during upswings. make bch the out performer in price. people notice and over time traders start to see bch as the out performer. i'm sure the math has been done on this. i just don't know what the answer is to the equation.

It's a psychological cycle. If you look at how long a lot of these Reddit accounts have been active it's like 3 months. You have a lot of people who probably bought when the price was quite a lot higher and now they are feeling despair which is the last part of the bear cycle. Usually once they sell there is a feeling of relief. At that point they may remain pessimistic as doing so helps them justify what they did. Around that point in time the price usually turns around and begins to go up again. Then they experience the next thing. Disbelief. I could keep going with this cycle but it happens again and again and again throughout history. Personally I believe the Bitcoin story is going to do one of two things. It's either going to go one hell of a lot higher or it's on its way to zero. Even if it is on its way to zero that's not going to happen anytime soon. You may notice none of the big money investors are heading for the door. Retail investors are taking off but you don't hear about the Winklevoss twins selling. Hell they are probably buying. Beings this Market is unregulated I can tell you with a fairly High degree of certainty the way it would end. Another price run will take place and it will go above the last. It's hard to say how much but probably at least 25,000. While that Euphoria is building and when we take out those previous highs a lot of people are going to come into the market. That's exactly where you will see the big holders begin to push their coins and sell off. The last thing those people are going to do is unload into a bear market
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:36:59
The only thing I can think of is Apple pay alienates a large part of the planet because a lot of people hate Apple. It still doesn't explain why it didn't work for people who like apple though. Maybe PayPal was more convenient? I mean crypto offers something different because the fees are so low. If Apple would have came out and had rock-bottom fees it may have caught on

I think it's more of a lagging indicator. Like I said in the other comment about this internet search traffic most likely follows price pretty closely. When the market is in an uptrend and exploding you have everyone searching for it. When it's in a bear market like it currently is you have very little interest. New people are brought into the space because they think about making money. Some of them only care about that and some of them really get into the technology and probably are the ones that stick around for quite a while and actually make some money

You could like cut and paste this from the past 9 years. Just alter the price a little bit. One of two things is going on here either just a pessimistic person. Highly possible since the internet is full of exactly that. The other one is you're just full of despair. This is exactly how you clean people out of their Holdings. The more people feel like you do the more coins that will get sold and the more people can buy them on sale. You let some time pass maybe a year to 18 months and then when it goes on a run again you will probably buy somewhere near the top and if you don't personally someone just like you will

You remember all that on a six-day-old account? Come now you've already been banned before if I had to guess. Trying to make the same argument you probably did last time and expecting a different result is not going to be productive.
I don't really want to have a debate about all of the things that happened because really.  I wasn't around for them I didn't know the people personally and I can't speak about anything other than what I've read.
What I can tell you is that in fighting and slander and a smear campaign is only going to attract the lowest common denominator. If I went out to every business in my community and made a pitch for them to accept BTC and you did the same thing in your community for BCH we would both be doing more for the crypto community than most. And you know what's crazy about that? we would be helping each other because each person that gets used to using crypto is one more person who's going to bring not only fiat to the game but help spread the adoption process.

Think about why. we have been in a downtrend for 5 months. If the market establishes a real up trend that goes for more than 3 months you're going to see people coming back pretty quick. The number one rule of trading is trade the trend. I don't think a lot of people unless they have Suicidal Tendencies want to short Bitcoin but the a lot of longs question buying into a stagnant market. When 12,000 is taken out and especially if that happens on high-volume we're going to get to 20 fairly quickly.

@_date: 2018-05-30 23:59:13
i like the comments from last year. it's going to 500. don't buy 1000. no no 3000 is too high you will lose everything. you're crazy if you don't get out at 10k ! it literally climbed a wall of worry and then, and then in december when it was at the ATH people were so bullish. 50k by spring. jan happens. this is just volatility. feb, this can't be, it will go back up.  now we are back to the world ending in may. i mean literally. the best bitcoin trading strategy of all time has been buy bitcoin. check price every so often. sell when it has a parabolic move of at least 5-10x. unless you bought in the last months of 2017 this strat has always worked and in the future the 2017 comment likely will not exist. will this continue to work? well the trend hasn't broken yet. name another trading strategy you can easily replicate that can claim the same. 
right now the game is cracking 11.7 and getting on the right side of the 200SMA when that happens and especially if it's powerful all the BTC 3k crew will be throwing in the towel and pushing the wave higher. the myth that 2018 will correct exactly like the last bear market is extremely unlikely. no market in history has ever had an identical correction. 
the person who said institutions are fishing for an actual bottom. the point prices will not go any lower is spot on. they are seeing where buyers step up and all year it's been the same number. 6 to 7k. that trend will eventually end but if you believe in the tech. the price can only go one way. if you want more people coming to the space and more miners, broad adoption. well...you sure won't get it with a 3k retrace.

@_date: 2018-05-31 21:35:50
Kind of. I wouldn't say it has anywhere near the recognition of something like that US dollar but let me make a point. If you had something I wanted to buy and I offered to pay in Bitcoin would you take it? Chances are that's a yes. That makes it a global currency or commodity. While you can't use it at McDonald's just yet it's not hard to argue that it's actually more useful than gold. While it's also easy to argue gold is more trustworthy it's considerably harder to sell. It's considerably harder to trade with.
I don't think some of these other people are deluded I just think to them they see Bitcoin as their currency

@_date: 2018-05-25 19:21:06
it's not possible...not really. 2-4k prices long term will have miners shutting down. hashrates will fall. trading also will dry up and liquidity will evaporate. you people wishing for a better deal need to really think this out. the long term path of least resistance is up, here's why.  traders don't care if it's $2000, 20,000 or 200,000 per coin. they need liquidity and low slippage. right now people vote with their coins and the prevailing vote is $7500 is a low price. no one is selling. volume is very low. it's not taking much to push the price down. if prices rise you will draw people out of their coins increasing liquidity and increasing demand. big money appears to be fishing for a bottom right now. how low will the market go before people stop selling. you may also notice not a single big player has liquidated. winklevoss etc. you may also notice network hash power is going up, not down. this market is full of closet bulls who just want to buy for the best deal. the thing is. by design. this market is far healthier when it's rising

When Bitcoin cash launched it had eight mb blocks exactly like Litecoin. It now has 32 but still can't come anywhere close to Visa. The other question is if they want a currency that means they want a stable value which seems to run against what the majority of their Community is interested in. Litecoin will be able to use the lightning Network and atomic swaps. I'm not sure how Bitcoin cash can maybe it can. maybe it can't? That part is over my head as I've never looked into it but any kind of broad use case is going to require off chain. It's either that or the blocks are going to have to get really really big and that brings on a whole nother set of problems. I can't speak for everyone here but I know I'm not personally against Bitcoin cash. I'm against the Shady marketing.

there's an interesting history to this. i actually asked those guys why they are 99% bch supporters but live in r/btc rather than r/bch. the short answer is they use to be btc supporters, changed their mind, some actually still like both but they stay there because of the traffic and established reddit of r/btc. to me this seems very strange. if i made my own btc fork it would have nothing to do with btc anymore. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:44:54
it took me awhile to get this and you most likely have if you have been around since 2013. the end game of bch and r/btc is to become what's known as bitcoin. they want to push btc into the same place as bitcoin gold and bitcoin private. i'm 80% sure they have a strategy to pump the price of bch at some point in the future. the burn pile at bitmain. so many coins held in strong hands. to me it's a question of when.

It's really not that far apart. People that get off on trolling and harming others don't usually stop with small time things. They push it and push it until they get pushed back. Some people might stop with a little internet trolling but as we have found out a lot of people like to push it further. Their lives are so miserable that the only thing they know how to do is try and spread that misery to others. I don't think you trolling type realize how destructive being this way is on your own mind. The laughs that you get are actually programming yourself to get off on negativity.

That's wild 4500 would be a direct repeat of 2014. With an 80% Peak to trough drawdown. That's literally going to pop those margin accounts one by one by one on a giant wave down. That's like a dream come true for a long-term investor. The gamblers will be swept out. It will free up a lot of coins. They will all be on sale. I'm surprised that made it this far without a lot of reporting about it because I see exactly what you're talking about looking at the numbers and just knowing the way stops blow up on large moves.  If things do get that bad.. well... historically it seems to take people about a year before they forget. That happens in Securities and it looks like on the long chart of Bitcoin the same thing plays out. After that 2013 crash it took about 18 months before things started to pick up again. What do you think would happen to mining in this situation? The thought that just ran through my head is bitmain would you see companies like that stepping in to support the market?

Oh I have had the exact same thought you just had a far more eloquent description of it. Some of those old addresses as you point out that have been inactive for a long long time. You start wondering why. The obvious answer is no one has access to them anymore. Isn't there one wallet that has like nearly a million coins or something that has never moved in the past 7 years? I mean no one that has access to something like that is going to do absolutely nothing. As you point out there are a lot of Wallets that either haven't moved or have not claimed their alt coins. Currently we are mining 1800 new Bitcoins a day. But that falls in half in what 2020? That's going to even further limit the supply.

That would be a lovely idea if we did not have to innovate. Incentive has to be given somehow. Right now it's financially. There are however other ways to incentivize. Perhaps Explore  those. One example right off the top of my head is a drug called sovaldi. Gilead made this probably with a lot of government backing. It's a drug that kills the hepatitis C virus which until recently killed people over a period of time. It's effective on pretty much everyone unless your liver is completely destroyed. I can't remember the exact cost but in the United States insurance pays something like 50 to $80,000 for this drug. Now if you're uninsured and poor they will sell it to you for something like $5,000 which is about what it would cost you to fly to India by the drug and stay in a hotel for a month to get treated. I should also mention the drug in India is like $1,000. It's the exact same drug.

You see all these people saying oh it's not worth that much. If you play around on bitcointalk you will find people every year saying that. No one will pay $100 for a Bitcoin. That's ridiculous. No one will pay 500 and so on. What matters is perceived value. We are coming off of a low right now and the majority of people still have an emotional bearish bias. You also have the second issue of people who have been around for quite awhile and they remember $1,000 at the beginning of last year. The truth of the matter is the price can go anywhere but the real fun will be had if it goes considerably higher. All of the people who have disbelief. All of the people that think it's overvalued. If the price continues to climb the overwhelming majority of them will eventually give in and this creates a massive buying wave

I can tell you why. Go the legal states. It's on every corner. Race to the bottom for pricing and market saturation comes on fast. Sooner rather than later it will be no different of a market than cigs n alcholol

You know my initial reaction to This was oh hell. Yikes. After thinking about it though. It's very risky but it attracts more people to the space and it attracts their money. As long as these exchanges are watching themselves and not doing risky Wall Street in 2008 type stuff it's probably positive except it creates larger volatility swings. Boom and bust Cycles. Do you know how long this has been going on because I was looking at the entire chart of Bitcoin from 2009 until today and it's very cyclical. Almost like you feel the emotion going from one extreme to the other

Guys I have a quick question. I'm relatively new to crypto but have spending hours and hours a day learning. Has the community always been so negative? Have people always been expecting the floor to fall? I realize we've been in a 5-month downtrend and that is going to wear on some people but I'm really curious about that. It seems like the crypto space attracts a lot of skeptics and negative personalities which I definitely don't like but if it's a common theme at least I can understand it. I wasn't able to tell if it has been caused from the five-month downtrend or if it's something that's been going on for years
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:35:29
I actually just had the same thought about Bitcoin and gold. Not putting your eggs in one basket and all that. A lot of old convention the money is going to find its way into gold in the next 18 months if the situation starts to play out like it appears to be. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:33:58
Yeah that's what another guy was saying to and it actually makes a lot of sense. The thing is if they had that kind of malicious intent. It just makes you wonder what the current plan is?
I mean I'm looking at the hashrate on bitcoin and I'm looking at the hashrate on bitcoin cash and it's really hard to believe that bitmain alone could be supporting most of Bitcoin cash which we know to be true and also contribute heavily to that giant number on bitcoin. If that is as it seems they have no hope of ever pulling off an attack strategy anymore....
Unless. And I have wondered about this one for some time. They are burning the supply of Bitcoin cash to make it smaller. If they can get the price of that coin to run and outperform Bitcoin they are going to draw more miners on to that Network. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:26:23
They totally missed their mark on the IPO. You just have to wonder why the hell they didn't do it in December. 
And if they aren't going to develop a new generation of miners waiting for the next bull market isn't going to work either
If they dump those bags Lord help us. Bitcoin cash for $99

I remember the same feeling. It was pretty awesome the longer I'm around the more I question the community though. there are a lot and I mean a lot of alt right weird aggressive hostile people into crypto. Like you get the vibe these people would rip you off or murder you just for fun
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:51:51
i also get the feeling a lot of r/btc is probably 12-19, terrible family structure. negative environment etc. i just can't figure out why they are there. that class of people are usually unemployed or best case working at a burger king and or selling drugs  
@_date: 2018-05-18 02:36:37
i was studying the charts earlier and noticed since bitcoin was invented it has had 2 parabolic bull markets. 2013 and 2017
in 2013 the bitcoin price run was basically 20 to 1000 or a 5000% increase. in 2017 it was much smaller at 2000% but still very much a run. 2014 also had mt gox go nuclear.  also note at the lowest point in the last bear market bitcoin never even got close to where 2013 started before the run up. the market low was found in spring of 2015 around $220 or 10x higher than the start of 2013 however it was an 80% peak to trough. after this it was an uptrend for years with corrections along the way. we had a MUCH smaller run in 2017 at only 2000% vs 5000% in 2013 and no mt gox blow up. it seems very unlikely to have a repeat as the news is actually really positive and you run into problems with the network in general below 5-6k minimum now. we also have already had a 70% correction with no where near as bad of news and no where near as big of initial run up. an 80% correction would be BTC 4k.  miners will start shutting down due to low profitability around 6k and or difficulty will have to fall....in fact that's already starting. you actually get more coin selling hashing power now than you did at this time last month. many of the dec/jan gpu miners are likely already leaving.﻿
the thing i noticed about all modern parabolic moves is they rarely if ever recover quickly. bitcoins massive run in 2013, the nasdaq in 1999. the thing that gets me though. both of those prior examples had real fundamental reasons that brought them down. 2017 really did not. people just sold....well. because lambo and beach house. 
if history repeats 2018 will not rally, it will simply be a consolidation year. weak hands will be shook out. difficulty may even fall on many alt coins. maybe even bitcoin. we may have seen the low at 6k and we may even test 5. going to 4 would be an absolute floor unless we are destined to go to zero. i'm sure a lot of miners would shut down. network traffic would fall. 80-90% of altcoins would die. 
 
my personal feeling is this may be a range bound year. we probably have an absolute floor at 5k and might go there if a hard attempt is made at the last 6k support. we also likely have resistance at 12k that will push back if we move through 10k. 
long term. this is healthy. weak hands are shook out and those of us who stick around will be able to mine easier and accumulate at good prices. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 08:07:01
The people that had this happen were already targets. They likely either fell for a phishing scheme or a pirate website or started bragging online about how many Bitcoins they had

Yes. I think the odds are really good 6800 holds. The short term low is likely between there and where we are at 7520

While not your keys not your bitcoin resonates with me I don't think it will or does with everyone. That said I think the ETF hype is becoming more and more of a non-issue . A weeks ago Goldman actually said they planned on managing crypto for clients. Or at least Bitcoin 
If the SEC will not approve an ETF people appear to be engineering very good workarounds to serve that clientele that would be interested in such a thing
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:41:43
The last evidence I can find of an actual audit was in September. It really is starting to make sense why some of the Doom and Gloom crowd is saying Bitcoin 4000 because really that's the worst case scenario. It's a technical repeat of 2014 and at the same time it's when the last audit of tether was actually done. On that last part it seems a little crazy unless they just went to town printing it because more people are involved in crypto now then there were in September of 2017. It does however help me understand the bearish argument a little. Then again I'm not sure how many of these bears actually realize  all of this
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:00:18

I don't really understand where you come up with a bubble? We had a 2000 % run in 2017 which was less than half the bubble run of 2013. In 2014 the maximum drawdown was 80%. We have already hit 70% on this one and it was a smaller run up than the last one. While I definitely agree there are a lot of crap coins it doesn't mean the market itself is overvalued it just means the money might be in the wrong places
@_date: 2018-05-31 01:58:45
If you get banned it's going to be because of your aggressive posting. You can't speak to people in such a way and expect them to be okay with it. If you post like you're looking for a fight don't be surprised when you receive one. 
In that entire reply all you're doing is blaming someone else. The mods. Crying to the sec. There is no self reflection.
If you believe in the Bitcoin cash project focus on making it better. Don't come over here with aggressive speak acting like everyone is oppressive for not seeing things the way you do. Mentioning of censorship. If someone goes over to r/btc and even makes a kind and respectful post the tribe jumps them. Even if it has nothing to do with the particular coins. There is an us versus them mentality. An intruder is here let's get them.

 While that might be the first thought that comes to your mind is it really the only one? Not many people buy things they don't believe in or have some kind of thought about. In fact the only real bubble I can think of was the Dutch tulip bulb run up. Even the NASDAQ in 1999 which famously gets called a bubble really had a lot of Merit behind it. It's what's responsible for modern society. Time will tell if Bitcoin has an impact like that but you might be buying a part of History

Dude 4K would be a complete technical breakdown. Like not even in the cards. If that was to happen you really don't want to buy. Not for a while and not until you understand what happened. If it goes to 4K the chances of it going to one k are extremely high. If it goes to 13K you definitely want to be buying because that will mean we cleared the 12000 resistance and it's game on. 4k would have a lot and I mean a lot of the miners shutting down. That would have a really bad domino effect

Yeah there's a pretty good chance that you just talked to the wrong division in the state. Here's what happens. The bank will send the money to the state after a period of inactivity. At that point it will go into a lost funds record. I had the same thing happen and it took me some phone calls and a little digging to get my money back but believe me you definitely can . it will be linked to your social security number most likely and you can search for it on various State websites that have to do with lost property. It took me about 30 minutes in my state to get it all figured out and eventually I got the right person on the phone that found it and they told me how to get it back. You might find a couple of employees who just don't want to deal with you and play the transfer game. Keep at it . the money is not gone

I don't really think it matters. It doesn't matter if somebody buys one Bitcoin for $1,000 or .1 Bitcoin for $1,000. Both of those people just want to see the price go higher. If we get a good rally up to 30 or $40,000 people are going to be salty they didn't buy at 6 just the same
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:49:27
Even if you ignore the inflation Hedge and sound money. Consider this. There are only a few million of these things out there. If you want one you're going to be paying for it. People spend over a hundred grand on old comic books. Millions on old cars. Bitcoin is the first successful blockchain project and it has some very good roots. People are going to want part of that if for no other reason just to be part of that. I do. So do a lot of others. You start getting people to realize what they have and not sell at these lower prices. What happens? The price runs higher. Traders don't really care if they are buying .1 Bitcoin or one Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin. In fact most people don't. If that price started going on and upward trajectory again it doesn't matter what the price is. It could be $50,000 and people will buy that all day long. The gamblers only care about if it will be 51000 next week or month. 
If those of us who owned a Bitcoin just decided we were not going to sell it until at least $50,000 that would happen. The supply would begin to dry up. This is what usually happens around the halving. That reduction of supply Works its way into the market in the following few months
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:12:53
This. If anything low interest is bullish. It's the same reason you buy stocks when people aren't looking at them. When there is little interest and nothing seems to be going on the people who were going to sell already have.
When everyone gets super excited again and the price goes on a major tear . people in the store are talking about Bitcoin. You might consider lightning up a little and scale out

The thing about these guys is they have likely already done the math. They know how much money it's going to take with how many coins are in float.

Not necessarily. April hovered for like a week or more at the low and the shorts piled in. We all know how that worked. I'm kind of 50/50 on this. On the one hand there could be one last exhaustive push. On the other it would surprise me if all the YouTube stars were actually right because that's what they are expecting. 
There is a near-certainty that large hands have already agreed on where they will defend the price. None of us little people really know where that is but we can guess that the $6,000 number has been in play all year. Now if you really wanted to run in some short sellers you could allow the market to drop to 57 5800. They are going to start piling in as 6000 is taken out. Give it a couple of days and Pile in the money. Get to 7000 within the hour.
Plan B is just let the market Trend sideways. Let the retail investors sell themselves out. Let all of the depression and despair run its course
I'm personally not that concerned with what is going to happen this year. My eyes are on regulation and getting something formal that allows an Institutional ETF and eventually a retail ETF. In order for this Market to move substantially higher the big money funds have got to come into it and they will once certain criteria have been met. If it goes to 5k. Oh well. If it goes to 10 or 15k to me it changes nothing other than how much coin I can accumulate. None of those numbers really interest me
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:12:44

Timing. Had you bought last January you would be loving life. In your case history says you will be okay it just may take awhile. People who bought in December 2013 we're able to break even in January 2017 and those who held even longer were able to realize up to a 20 fold gain.
It sucks. I'm sure it would bother me a bit if I had done the same. The thing is. This project is either going to go a lot higher or it's going to go to zero.

* a challenge for people who believe in TA like a religion. trade off of it without stops and see how long you last 
what's my point? people who rely on only the chart are wrong a lot. cognitive bias plays a BIG part. they can be profitable if they have good trading habits. quickly cutting losses and letting profits run. it does not however mean they are right as most the big names on youtube and trading view are wrong....a LOT

Not really we have multiple billionaires that have invested very sizeable sums into actual Bitcoin. Also note the Futures Market tracks actual Bitcoin. 
If they truly felt Bitcoin was worthless why would they be investing in exchanges and looking to set up funds? 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:09:43
Yes... but it actually would have worked. That was a profitable strategy. If someone looked at 2013 and literally just copied the exact same strategy in 2017 they would have made a killing. I mean if you back Test to 2009 one of the simplest and silliest methods ever has been 100% profitable. If you buy Bitcoin at any time it is more than 60 to 70% off an all-time high and you just sit on it . sooner or later not only will the previous all-time high be broke but there will be a new one. That's happened Time After Time After Time and if you look at why it happened there's just an insanely high probability that it will happen again. that of course would take hours and hours and hours of study and a lot of people in here I am fairly sure just gamble and have very little interest in the psychology behind the market
@_date: 2018-06-16 04:08:34
I don't actually doubt that they can come up with 2.6 billion. I mean look at the info from last year and look at the volume they do.
It's those other parts that are questionable. How is the money insured? If it even is. If they were completely transparent about it and it was named to Security in the United States could they even do business in the United States anymore until that is rectified? This is why I'm not a total conspiracy theorist about tether because from a few different angles it's actually in their interest to stonewall until they figure out another system to use for US dollars. Bitmain is getting behind circle. I'm sure the market will figure something out sooner or later. Until more information comes to light this is literally one of those subjects you just have to push to the back of your brain.
@_date: 2018-06-23 07:25:24
Yeah 80% is optimistic on that. The Wall Street study pegged it closer to 90. 
I'm with you on that. I think that's a lot of what is behind the extreme pessimism and negativity we are seeing in here. The Traders are losing money and it comes out in their comments as negativity
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:26:22
I see you're bringing logic to an emotional discussion. We are supposed to ignore the fact that millions of people even if they only bring $100 each could create just a massive rise. It's fud day today.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:56:33
Because if they did it would be an open book to tether being a security and the potential for the SEC to keep a American buyers out of anything to do with it until it meets regulation.
That's the one big reason I can think of
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:09:59
No idea. I'm just looking at the behavior. However you can use that comment to mirror yourself. I personally didn't believe I was typing anything like that but if you took what I said that way consider you may have a bias. If you do then you learn more about yourself
Right now the pessimism is feeding on itself. That much I can see just reading through the comments on various crypto forums.
I'm not 100% sure where we are but I believe it is somewhere between anger and depression
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:06:10
There was a time when people paid over $100,000 for a comic book. Oh wait they still do
There was a time people paid over $1,200 for an ounce of yellow metal. Oh wait they still do
There was a time that people argued that housing was going to become worthless and you should just rent. Then housing turned around for a 100% gain in a lot of American cities
The thing about bubbles is if you're actually in one people don't realize it. At least most people don't and that was December. By the time they finally realize it's a bubble which is what's going on in here now oftentimes you're right about at the low. That was the case and housing. The most extreme pessimism is when the deals were the absolute best. That was the case with tech stocks. If you would have bought practically any decent tech company in 2003 it was a ridiculously easy return. It's when everyone was terrified of anything with the word Tech
We are at the same situation with Bitcoin right now. Could It Go lower? Sure. In fact it might. But it hasn't happened yet and we are still sitting right on support. I have a really hard time finding bearish comments in December and a very easy time finding them right now. You guys are being emotional.

Probably because consumers aren't the ones with super heavy pockets. Most of the 4800 theories are based on two things. Elliott wave and a repeat of the last market.  Markets almost never have a direct repeat in fact I can't think of one in the entire history of Wall Street. Even looking at Bitcoin and the various runs and dips there are no two that are exactly alike. 
My personal thought is as far as we are off the high historically that is an excellent time to buy. I wouldn't go all in but starting to cost average right now makes a lot of sense. If it goes lower okay, if it doesn't follow it up as far as you feel comfortable
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:35:39

what has guarantees of returns?
even tbills aren't 100&amp; they are more like 99.9&amp; and you make a whopping 2-3&amp; a year which is where inflation is
insurance is definitely not guaranteed. what happens when the company goes bank-o?
major firms who shorted housing in 2008 actually had risk that no one would be able to pay off their shorts. they were right but the numbers were so big there was risk of banks collapsing {happened} and insurance collapsing {also happened} that only left the fed between them and insolvency and the fed forced sales. jp morgan for one got an absolute steal on the assets they purchased

Here's the thing. The conspiracy theory is bitfinex is printing tether to manipulate the market to their every whim.
Major issue number 1. They make an obscene amount of money everyday. Compromising that to cash in in the short-term seems ridiculous. 
Major issue number 2. Even if they are fraudulently pumping with each day that goes by they are not doing so they can fix the cooked books via paying themselves back
Minor issue number 1. The majority of the people who think this whole thing is going to go insolvent seem to have a skeptical gambling mentality. Personally speaking it seems likely they are thinking about what they would do in that position because they gamble with their own money

You guys are seriously getting worked up in here. I'm going to provide a quick history lesson. Watch this video it's only a couple of minutes and look at historical volatility. There's absolutely nothing concerning going on right now. If we blow through 5000 could be a potentially different situation but it just hasn't happened 
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:27:07
All true.. or you could have bought back in in 2009 to 2010. I realize statistically most people who try and time the market fail. However when a recession is around the corner I'm all for using stop losses and then buying back in once the damage is done. We are Midway through a tightening cycle. Maybe another year . hard to say really. There will be a credit crunch. If it's nothing big maybe you will be okay but having a stop loss 10% under where you are now really isn't a bad idea. If the stock is going to drop 10% there's a really good chance it's going to drop a little more and you can reevaluate when you want to buy in. That's what I'm doing anyway. Your mileage may vary
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:50:13
Yeah I completely agree with you on all that actually. I came to the same conclusion and in the case of Bitcoin you have a cornered Market on top of it. There is a fixed supply.

Flip side. Skeptics never make it very far. They are too scared to take the chance. What if it goes wrong they say? People said this about housing in 2009 verbatim. It doesn't matter what the market is. The emotions are always the same. 
Is it possible this all dies ? Sure but it's the psychology. If you're scared of this chances are you will be fearful of other heavily sold markets. This is why the masses buy the top and sell the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:02:32
Why couldn't you swap it? I mean if it's some conspiracy theory worry about tether just bolting off with the money you have that risk with every unregulated crypto exchange. The reason they don't do it is because it's more profitable to stay in business. Well that and I'm sure whales would send hitters in the direction of the guy who runs off with countless Millions

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that the government is fair or just or any of that. They absolutely do make examples out of people and some really sadistic shit just because they can.
He ran a really Risky Business and as many people and even countries have found out if you get on the wrong side of the US government you're going to lose
From a sentencing perspective it really doesn't matter if he ordered a hit or not. what matters is if the cops said he did. That's all it takes to put you in prison. There was an 80 year old grandma in Wenatchee Washington that went to prison for years on some sex charges. Anyway to make a long story short they were really bizarre and I forgot how it happened but they uncovered the whole thing was fabricated. If they are going to put 80 year old grandmas in prison on a whim the only lesson to take from that is you don't want to be anywhere near a suspect list
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:23:50
That's about what I suspected. I mean it's possible. It's also possible history won't repeat. Well....unless you happen to know people that have a lot and I mean a lot of money and this is just the plan. If the game is rigged from the start of course it will play out that way.
Bitcoin has had more than one boom and bust cycle over the years. The fundamental situation does not look anything like 2014 to me. Expecting the same situation would be like expecting the housing crisis to play out like the .com bust.
I guess what I'm getting at is have you given any thought to what you will do if you're wrong? There are so many people expecting a repeat of 2014 right now. It's literally the most popular viewpoint in crypto right now
If everyone expects 4 to be the bottom pre-emptive buying will take place before that event
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:40:42

Same. I figured that one out just looking at the psychology and looking at what the market was. Literally the endgame is accumulating as much Bitcoin as possible and possibly etherium. Everything else doesn't really matter that much. If someone held just those two coins that would probably be a much wiser decision that having a list full of alts even though there are some really quality projects like Litecoin and Monero
@_date: 2018-06-01 03:59:26

@_date: 2018-06-13 19:24:31

@_date: 2018-06-16 01:10:20
Doesn't really matter. market is littered with false breakouts and breakdowns. If we punch through 5800 on high volume there's a good chance that's going to go to at least 5000. If that doesn't happen we may have a support level here. Technical analysis is almost never down to the dollar. The other thing that is getting overlooked is where the big players have agreed to defend the price. I can almost promise you a lot of the major wallets all know each other and all chat with each other to some degree. It would absolutely blow my mind if they did not come up with various strategies. When I look at the trade index a lot of it is retail investors. All kinds of 50 to $1,000 orders popping off. 
I actually asked Charlie Lee about this a few hours ago on Twitter. I said remember 2017, in December when you were warning about the market getting hot? What's your opinion of it right now? I'll just cut and paste his reply
Market does what market does. It's correcting and consolidating. Could be quick, could be slow to recover.
What he said is what any non-emotional logical person would come to for conclusion. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:27:45
This is like a glimpse into the future. The more economical and low-cost coin mining can be the better it is for the future. Number one the miners make more and number two they can weather downturns considerably better. For example, right now a lot of people mining in  higher power cost areas are already shut down. Southern California is completely out of the picture. The handful of states that have power under $0.12 a kilowatt hour are still going well. It would be interesting to see how much investment in solar and maintenance actually equals compared to kilowatt hour 
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:41:45

this would be a complete technical breakdown going all the way back to 2009, it would also likely compromise crypto completely. most the asics are unprofitable at this price and that hashpower will be used elsewhere. 51&amp; attacks will become common. any hope of institutional money or widestream acceptance will be best case delayed 5\+ years. worst case crypto will become a niche gamblers market. 
aprox 4500\-5000 would be the same percentage correction as mt gox blowing up in 2013. even this would be suspect as today is no where near that bad. that doesn't mean people won't make emotional choices and dump overshooting the downside just like they did the upside. it would just severely call into question the health of bitcoin long term
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:55:44
No kidding. I think the most popular guess this week is 4K. All kinds of people are throwing that one out there. They are like I'm going to look at a few years ago and see what happened and then I'm going to make only one plan that includes the exact same thing happening again. Often times I ask them so what will you do if you're wrong? Crickets chirp
The safest way I see to play this if you have the time to do it is buy support levels and set stops on the break. If 5800 holds great you look for the higher high and higher low. If you get continuation then you can get more aggressive. If 5800 does not hold you look at 53 to 55. Get an entry on a wick and set a stop. Look for a continuation pattern. You basically repeat this process fishing for bottoms
Or if you just don't want to be bothered with trading or you have realized you're not very good at it because your emotional; cost averaging has been a great way to play markets over the years. 
I personally don't see how the fundamentals support a retrace to 4K which would be the equivalent of the last bear market but it is something that I can't completely discount so risk management has to be part of the strategy
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:35:21

Probably stepping back and just reading occasionally. I'm kind of getting to that point because this sub is just a constant recirculation of new people and right now they have bought and the prices went down so they panic and decide they hate it and have no sense of History. A lot of people I would imagine who were in this for the Long Haul like I am really aren't concerned by these daily fluctuations. Someone else said it and I completely agree. If you don't believe in Bitcoin you might as well sell right now because if you don't you're going to in the near future. Most people can't handle the ride
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:21:12
i think they are looking at it from a marketing perspective. bitcoin grew from nothing in 2009..what would happen if it was placed in front of the masses? 
lot of the big money holders are pushing for this. winks, tim etc.  broad adoption as digital cash or a store of value both equal more hands going after the same number of coins.

You're absolutely right about not being a safe investment but that's also why it can have such outstanding returns. On the one hand I just bought a value play. Dsx is the ticker. It's a Greek shipping company that is selling under Book value. Here's the kicker the Baltic dry index that directly influences their day rate has been trending up. Earnings have been increasing. The company went from bleeding money to only losing $0.01 a share on the last earnings report. Add in any kind of favorable situation with North Korea and I have a potential for a 50% stock here by the end of the year. That I can rationally argue. Bitcoin on the other hand. It's all in the eye of the beholder which is why it has these radical swings. The thing I'm looking at is it has 9 years of History. If this project was only a year old I would be terrified of it but people have spoken. Historically we still have not sold off as bad as the last parabolic run. If anything more people are in the space now and more people are interested. Imo you cant invest more than you can forget about

Well the SEC made an announcement on CNBC today. I'm trying to remember the exact wording but it was basically the whole thing they are after is to make sure the assets are there. I'm sure they are concerned about tether and I'm sure they want to make sure the exchanges actually have all of the coins that are being traded. Basically they want an audit. It seems likely at least one exchange has something up. I wonder who's cooking the Books or if they will try to cover it up before they get audited
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:10:50
I figured a lot of you guys would see this. I've been in markets quite awhile. Not crypto but markets in general. This psychological cycle so far is playing out like clockwork. You never really know how bad it's going to get but so far there have not been any red flags whatsoever. The time to worry is when you see a major coins getting 51% attacked which could only happen if the price really tanks and we lose a ton of hash power and most importantly you see people like the Winklevoss Twins and bitmain backing out. Now if that happens we have trouble. Right now the cycle is on schedule to do what it's going to do. 
This Market is more profitable for everyone when it goes up. However that does not mean you make the most profit by always having it go up. As we found out in December everyone and their dog gets into crypto when the price goes on a run and at that point you really can't buy anymore. It's ridiculously expensive for the time. If you're going to learn from the past 9 years there's one way to make this work. You buy when everyone is panicking and you sit back and go do something else and wait. Run your miners and accumulate because when this goes on the run again you're not going to be able to buy mining equipment and the cost to buy the coins is going to be very high which should be the market you sell into. Or you can be like a lot of people and sell the bottom and buy the top
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:00:01
psychological cycles. 
you're 100&amp; right by the way. 
people have a primitive part in their brain that is good at spotting patterns. this means they have to "label" bitcoin by past experience. if they bought in during jan. if they looked at a chart between 2017 and stocks in 1999 they draw conclusions. once someone develops a negative mindset it takes awhile to work through. any of you ever have a girl you were REALLY into then she dumps you? you don't get over that in a day, or a week, or a  month. there's a chemical level change in your brain as you process that emotion. everyone will tell you that you aren't seeing clearly which is of course true. 
i see the same thing with bitcoin today. people focus on the negative, buying a peak, what if it doesn't work etc. after spending countless hours researching i found tons of the same comments in 2014. actually it was much worse than. the bad news just kept coming. people were depressed. they had given up. that guy who's paying $200 for a useless coin is crazy they said. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:06:42
You should have asked that question in 2014.
4 years later how exactly did that work out. You could have bought the dip at 800. 600. All the way down to 200. Just for argument sake let's say your average was 600. Well even at today's prices you would have a tenfold gain
But waiting 4 years isn't something the ADHD generation can do
No one truly knows what is going to happen this time which is why there is an element of risk. If I look at the market since 2009 anytime Bitcoin had a 70%or more correction you would have made out well to buy it. At this point you can do one of two things. Follow history . or follow your emotions. Choose one

I can think of quite a few historical examples of valuable things getting sold to the floor. I'm not sure how many of you are from the United States but do you remember 2009 and 2010? People were literally talking about houses becoming worthless. Comments like I'm just going to rent forever. I'm going to lose it all if I buy a house. People literally were arguing a home was drastically overpriced because nobody would want to buy them. Back then you were actually able to buy a home for less than it would cost you to rent. Looking back that was just flat ridiculous because many areas have literally doubled in value since then. 
CNBC and the banks and the media play people against themselves. Most of the time if you hear them talking up something everyone is already in. If there is a lot of fear and uncertainty that's usually where you can get your return. All these articles about Bitcoin being in trouble and all the Fud. That's great because you guys Remember December? It was on CNBC every day and people were talking about how high it would go. The world was just perfect in crypto. That's a market top. Where we are now is a hell of a lot closer to the bottom and possibly at the bottom
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:39:49
They can keep the interest but it's unlikely tether is going to completely collapse. It's completely possible people are going to go to something else if they can't use u.s. dollars or euros to trade but there will still be tether out there and all they have to do is make sure that each one has one US dollar in the bank. the amount in circulation can easily shrink, all that means is they make less interest. 
The reason I don't believe it's in their interest to just hijack and take the money is it would collapse all the trust in that exchange and with the trading volume on bitfinex alone that's a ton of money each and every single day

Yeah that's the thing we knew Willy pump the market and mount gox blew up. The price action we are seeing and the way it's going is basically an expectation of bitfinex collapsing and tether being hot air. Like that's the kind of fundamental similarity we would want to see if you expect the same kind of Correction.
I don't Honestly by the tether conspiracy. It's actually more profitable for them to be straight up about it. A collapsed exchange makes no money

Also a good argument to be made for wall street being in the complacency phase. We still have not taken out the all time high this year and the FED is tightening fairly aggressive.

some do but 90&amp; of fast traders lose money in the long term. with anything in life you're well served by looking to those who have succeeded and following what they do.
i don't know of a single bitcoin day trader who really made it big. are there any?
shopping list of early adopters who simply bought and held as adoption increased are multi millionaires.
basic TA i think makes a lot of sense. market goes up 10-20-30x in a year. you may want to be careful and use mandatory stop losses. market drops 50&amp; and especially over 70&amp; from the ATH start buying. this you can backtest, this {so far} has a 100&amp; success rate. most technical patterns have a 48-52&amp; work / not work ratio. good traders with titanium balls make this work by quicking limiting losses and letting the winners ride. roughly 1 in 10 people can do this successfully. there was a decade long study on wall street that examined the profit/loss of traders. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:37:16
Could be. I'm sure there are more wealthy people behind the scenes that don't have their face on the news covers like the Winklevoss Twins and Tim Draper. 
It's like come on here guys do you really think the billionaires are investing all this money into Bitcoin if it's going to fall apart? Hell no. they are going to Corner the market and make people fomo. That's what you do with stocks and it's what you do with real estate.

You mean the emergency adjustments? That's not really going to save all the old mining equipment that gets sold. If it's not profitable to mine with it where is it going to go? There was just a ridiculous amount of hash power sold in 2017. Did you see that chart of how much it would cost to attack so many coins on the market? Now imagine taking some of that network hash power offline. Now imagine being able to purchase hash power cheaper
That's a perfect scenario for attacks
If you could make all of that hash power disappear then sure. You could go back in time. Let me know when you find the DeLorean
The absolute best-case scenario is more mining will start to take place in the parts of the world with the lowest power costs. If that were to happen we can probably withstand 2500 to 3000? Somewhere in there but even that is a gamble because you don't really know how much hashpower is going to continue to increase. Just looking at the difficulty chart it's still going up even as the price goes down. If you start talking about lower prices than that then you're talking about a drop in difficulty and hash power coming off line. Which rewinds to my previous statement. If you know something I don't by all means lay it out
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:12:17
Well if that's how you feel go ahead and sell. That's not how I see it but that's what makes it a market

The point is set a stop loss and then set a stop buy right after it triggers
At least when a recession is imminent
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:34:01
I'm not a hundred percent sure it would survive.  The biggest concern is all the miners going offline. That period of time before an emergency difficulty adjustment happens leaves a lot of crypto open to a 51% attack. I mean maybe they would circle the wagons around Bitcoin but so many others would be ripe for attack.
At this point you can forget any interest from large institutions or anything on a commercial level. Extremely unprofitable in the long run. 
Think about how much more hash power exists in the wild right now vs 2015

You want the most simple one? Look at all the people interested in crypto. There are roughly 5 million Bitcoins in float. The rest are in very solid hands. Whenever you have a very small amount of something and a lot of people that want it the price naturally will rise. The difference between $600 Bitcoin $6,000 Bitcoin and $60,000 Bitcoin is a decimal place. 
People are paying over $100,000 for certain comic books just because they are very hard to come by. Now if we develop a very broad use case with lightning Network and it becomes really mainstream the sky is definitely the limit. Eventually as Bitcoin matures the volatility should die down. The other argument is if Bitcoin becomes digital gold. We digitize everything these days . music. Pictures etc. It's not a stretch to argue digital gold because, well, look at the history

No idea. I think long-term a person would be just fine buying right here. There are three likely scenarios that I see. One of them is we get rejected off 6800 and head lower. The second one is we have a rally for a few weeks and get rejected around the mid 8s continuing the lower high pattern we have had all year. 
The third one is a break out into a different trading range. It's completely possible the market will decide to run past 10,000 but not approach new highs. You just set a higher low and get on the right side of the 200
It all depends on who's buying. This year we have seen buyers step up every time we get around that 6000 number. A literal shit ton of people expect Bitcoin to go to 4K which is probably why that isn't going to happen. Even if it started heading there pre-emptive buying would begin before that number was actually hit
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:02:10

For sure that's why markets always overshoot both directions. The fear of what if it keeps going down makes people sell. Just like the hope of wow it keeps going higher makes them buy at higher and higher prices. Ever since I got into Bitcoin I couldn't help but notice what a huge psychological experiment it is

you won't see this with everyone. those of us who know these cycles do the opposite. i was bearish as hell in december and firmly have on my bull cap now. maybe it goes lower? so what. with a 70&amp; drawdown the downside is limited unless we are breaking the 9 year trend or going to zero 
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:21:07

yea, i just did that, was looking at the cycles &amp; wave trace outs. watching the 15m right now. shorts keep getting rejected around that 5800-5900 mark. just nibbling. really hard to tell if this will hold and consolidate for a july reversal or if we are going to break the low and have a final flush out. bitcoin seems to enjoy trading where there is the most pain. anywhere from 5000-5400 would have people losing their shit and another wave of panic sells
so far the yearly support has held. did put stops on ltc at 72 though. if that breaks the support is around 60
eth especially still has a ways to go before the april low of 359
if you guys have a long term perspective. toss $50-100 right now. you're buying support. if that breaks stop it or eat it. small loss. if it rallies you feel like a rockstar calling the low and you feel great about bitcoin again

So I live here. The culture is very functional but if you're not used to it it may look a bit peculiar. If you go to deep Texas it's kind of the same thing in reverse. 
There really is no pressure. You just have a very high degree of liberal people. Consider this your beliefs are most likely formed by who you are around growing up. In the case of San Francisco you have this huge group influence. 
I realize it's culture shock from other parts of the country but most people mean well, they just want to see Healthcare and better education for everyone. As far as hate groups and hate speech the litmus test you should use is what would the world be like if everyone did exactly the same thing? 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:02:12
The difference is a lot of us don't agree with you. Gold is kind of useless metal honestly. There is a legitimate using Electronics but come on that is not what creates the value. What creates the value is that it is the original Ledger system. It has all these years  of trust because people used it as currency and people used it as a store of value .The more people that see Bitcoin as the same thing the more Bitcoin becomes gold. It's all in your head. If everyone tomorrow felt that gold was stupid it would lose its value over night.
That said, what I seriously don't get is why so many of you who don't believe in Bitcoin or have no interest in it come to this forum? Like what the hell. That would be about as ridiculous as me going over to a trump forum and talking about how smart Bernie Sanders was. It doesn't even matter who's right. What matters is I would be wasting my time and adding a lot of negativity to my life. The same thing you guys are doing
I also don't buy the argument that you no coin types are trying to save people. Society is not empathetic. Society does not look out for one another. Society is however very jealous. The most plausible explanation I can come up with for the people who are really against Bitcoin is they are just flat-out jealous. They hate the fact that a group of people have made a lot of money off of an idea that they didn't.

Fundamentals can be confusing because you never know how much of it is just hype and how much of it is real. Price at least reflects an honest opinion of what the market thinks. 
If Bitcoin was replaced it would definitely not be overnight and it would most likely be a series of bad decisions on the part of the Developers. The only reason Google overtook AOL is because of AOL. the only reason Apple and Android overtook Blackberry is because of BlackBerry. 
If either one of these companies would have outmaneuvered the competitor they would still have market dominance. I think a lot of people are very aware of that with Bitcoin but at the moment there are two particular arguments. One of them is a store of value and if that plays out it almost doesn't matter what happens with Bitcoin. The market will just agree it's worth a certain value. Kind of like gold which is a virtually useless metal the world agrees is worth a lot. I suppose diamonds would be an even better example. Or emeralds. 
The second argument is as digital cash or currency. Depending on how development goes lightning Network may or may not be the Holy Grail of digital currency. This is still currently playing out but people will be able to make moves as it does should they need to. It took AOL over 10 years to lose market dominance. If the same thing happens to bitcoin the first thing you are going to see is the Challenger start getting more trading pairs and start getting more investment along with more Real World Adoption. Currently the only only one that even has signs of life is ethereum. Bitcoin cash and Litecoin are trying to grow but only one of those two is really trying to challenge Bitcoin. The other one simply wants to be a supplement to it
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:20:49
I know that and you know that but human psychology has people looking to spot patterns in everything. I think it's a very primitive part of our brain. People have a hard time with uncertainty so they try to rationalize practically everything and with markets a lot of that goes back to patterns. Saying 2014 will repeat gives them a feeling of security. If enough people do it you have a self-fulfilling prophecy
Its wild really. 2013 looks nothing like 2017 yet they expect 2018 to be 2014
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:36:19
I wasn't around for that one but I have been studying the 2014 time period pretty extensively for the past few months. The one thing I'll ask your opinion on is what you think of the price action? On the one hand the fundamental situation in 2014 was considerably worse than this one. There are also more people in the market now which historically makes markets less volatile. I really can't figure out if this thing is going to drag on until the next halving or if we are just going to continually cycle off support and have kind of a flat sideways market for awhile and or potentially leg down. Seems like historically when you get 70% off the high the bottom isn't far away. The psychology though. Oh my God I feel like I'm reading the same posts that I found from 2014. It's the same emotions just with different usernames

You actually read the Howey case? Did you actually read the SEC decision I suspect a big giant no to both of those. 
The four points of the Howey decision are
It is offered in exchange for money
There is an expectation of profits
The investment is in a common enterprise
The profits are dependent on the efforts of a promoter or third party
But it goes quite a lot deeper than that because the SEC specifically spoke about centralization when they said etherium was not a security. They also left the door open to tokens that may be Securities now not becoming Securities in the future if they are decentralized. Tether on the other hand is 100% centralized and Strikes number one on the Howey test dead in the middle. You could also argue number four because the profits are completely dependent on the effort of a third party.
Tether is also 100% centralized

mmm...i see it more as stepping back and letting people do their thing. there are probably quite a lot of people who came in only for a quick price move. they aren't getting it and have been selling one by one since jan. 
i'm not buying {yet} but am still mining. once people get the selling out of their system i'll do some purchasing. i'd be surprised if we are still downtrending by next summer. psychologically hitting whatever the low is and trending sideways for 6 months or so, maybe longer would be a near perfect setup for the next uptrend. if the market appears to be dead you shake out the maximum number of coins

an 18yr old today looks outside and sees $1500mo rent and $15hr jobs, they wonder how the hell that works. in 1950 a man could work a 40hr week. buy a house and support a wife and kid along with buying a car. today a man can work 40hrs a week and afford a room in a house with 4 other guys and buy an older used car.

I will save you the trouble. There is no credible evidence to give you a rock solid answer on Tether. I spent time looking into it and so have many of the other members. 
There are a few theories. One of them is bitfinex is printing tether out of thin air  and or they have printed way more than they actually have dollars for. That's the bear case
Second bitfinex has the money but they don't want to comply with us regulations. That's kind of the camp I'm leaning in simply because it's more profitable for them to continue operating. 
3rd and this is kind of a play on number 2. Bitfinex refuses to have an audit because the information gathered would be a playbook for the SEC. Tether would almost certainly be considered a security. That may still happen in the future. Bitfinex is completely aware of this and some of the more recent news points to them wanting to move away from us customers.

It's that psychology. Did you see that market chart that was posted in here today? There is all this fear going around right now that Bitcoin might be worthless and tether isn't backed by anything at all. 
On the flip side when the price was going up all of the YouTube promoters were talking about the sky being the limit and everyone was very optimistic. 
People will spend $10,000 if they see a trend and think it's going to $11,000. People are terrified to spend $7,000 if they think it might go to $6,000

and the bottoms aren't as deep. more hands holding fewer coins. this again is a fundamental reason 2014 is unlikely to repeat directly. buyers are supporting the price here. sellers question selling so cheap. the lower it goes the more greedy long term holders get. 
to those of you expecting 4k or even that one noodle who said 500. would you actually sell a bitcoin you had for that price? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:58:25
your argument is exactly what turned me on to crypto. late last year when the price was going crazy i was like hmm.. nasdaq 1999 again. i'm not buying that ! i did however keep reading. found out my gaming computer could sell hash power to the tune of a few dollars a day. i sold hash power since it was bitcoin i wanted. had no idea what the hell most alt coins were. learned a lot more over the past 7-8 months. have bought twice so far. once in april and once today. other than that i have 8 GPU's and 3 CPUs slaving away cost averaging myself in.
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:28:19
It's just really unlikely. Markets never directly repeat. Fundamentally this should be a smaller bear market than 2014. 
There's literally no real bad news out there. It's one of the more bizarre things I've ever seen in the market actually. On Wall Street Markets actually climb a wall of worry after they make a bottom. Like the news continues to get worse and the price action it gets better. This Market is being a little weird or maybe it's just how crypto is always been because this is my first real crypto bear Market. This Market is falling on a wave of positive news.....
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:11:39
Yeah, I had the same thought. There's really no way to know. A couple other people pointed it out that bitmain now is getting behind Goldman Sachs and that new tether type coin they are offering. I mean I sure as hell don't know their inside plans but it looks like the bet now is on the market in general. Not just one specific coin. If Bitcoin cash is going to live it's going to have to do it on its own. Again I don't know if they have put plans for the hostile takeover on the back burner or completely scrapped in them but it looks like they are going in a different direction today versus a year ago.
The way I see it this whole thing is probably about the money so they are going to take the path that is the most profitable

That's a really well thought-out comment man and very factual evidence. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:28:06
That's the same thing I have been thinking. If your new or if you sold a lot of your Holdings in 2017. Really. You don't want the price to go high. You want it to just kind of cruise along. If Bitcoin went to 50,000 tomorrow it would just piss you off because you aren't going to have that much to sell and Mining would get just ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:43:32
Yeah I actually had thoughts about all of that. The thing about this Market is you can't really value it. At least not yet. The most similar is probably the.com era because that was a lot of euphoria but again this one is different. I really hate using that line because it's usually what people say right before a crash. We already had a 1999 happen in 2013. Now we had another one. Also keep in mind the FED is what killed the Kool-Aid in the.com era. Once they raised interest rates and lending dried up that was it. 
We have an established 9-year uptrend with Bitcoin. We still have a lot of big money investors. We still have no signs of them selling. The.com crash also gave way to better tech companies. The only reason AOL is not Google is because of bad management. AOL could have been Google. Easy. Bitcoin is probably going to face that test and if it fails Roger ver is going to be right there to pick up the pieces. It is however exactly like you say. A reasonably unpredictable emerging-market. I certainly would not invest enough money in this that it would keep me up at night. I knew when I got into Bitcoin the best strategy would be to get in after the sell-off happened and then turn off the screen and wait. Possibly cost average in along the way and run a miner. To me that's the best risk-reward but everyone has to make that decision themselves

Same people said 10000 months ago. Then it was 6000.. technically the best support level we have is right where we're at. The next big one is 4500 to 5000. All they are doing is looking at past pricing and drawing a line across. 
I follow quite a few of the crypto people on YouTube and right now not a single one of them has been right. There are a couple of quality channels like the chart guys who talk about trading and just have a disciplined approach. They don't make predictions. They just teach proper Trading. Earlier this year practically every YouTube station was saying it's just a minor correction. We will be back past 20000 before the end of the year. Now they are all saying lowball shit like 2000 or 3000
If you examine the worst bear Market in Bitcoin history it started the year at $20 and ran up to a thousand under massive manipulation. It then corrected as low as 160 but that was a very temporary blip we will just say 200 because that's where it actually traded along the bottom for a bit. That's a 50 fold increase and an 80% correction. In 2017 we had a 20x increase and 70% correction. Technically there is no basis for it to go to 80 because the move up was considerably different but that doesn't mean it won't. This space is filled with emotional little girls. The bottom line is you can watch people on YouTube and get an opinion but so far not a single one of them has been correct. Find me one single video published in January that said Bitcoin would be at 5 to 6000 today.

@_date: 2018-06-14 04:05:45
Uh. Yea. Its everywhere but if you have developed a negative mindset to the market you probably won't notice it. Right now we are basically waiting on the SEC to do what they need to do. You may notice they have never said no to a Bitcoin ETF. What they have said is there are different rules and regulations that need to happen and Hoops to jump through. There are already Bitcoin ETFs in the United Kingdom and the US is almost an identical country.
All of this is still going on. You just have Panic selling at the moment. A lot of angry people. Some of them are already slipping into depression about this. I mean I use the comments in here as a market gauge since Bitcoin is such an emotional market. We are in between anger and depression right now. Sooner or later the real rally will begin and the majority of the comments will still be in disbelief. You will hear things like yeah it's about to fall as it continues to climb higher. I'm not sure if you've read a lot of the threads and comments since 2009 but I have probably spent 30 or 40 hours doing exactly that recently. There is absolutely nothing different today. Many people just cannot control their emotions and it's playing out just like it did in the past
I will tell you right now the kind of news headlines that would make me sell. Winklevoss twins closing Gemini and stepping away from the Bitcoin Market. Bitmain no longer creating mining equipment and downsizing. Coinbase laying off more workers and closing in other countries. This is the kind of stuff that tells you things are going to go to hell.

The 9-year trend of Bitcoin. What else could I have been referring to?
In 2013 the year started at $20 and ended at a thousand. Then we made a low of about 200 which is an 80% correction. That situation was night and day worse than this one. I mean literally please argue why today is so terrible because it's really easy to argue why 2014 was.
Arguing for $2,000 is not only saying today is worse than 2014 ever was it would break the long-term trend of percentage correction after a run. We had a 50-fold gain in 2013. We had a 20x gain in 2017.  80% correction in 2014 and so far a 70% correction in 2018. 
Keep in mind trying to figure out what will happen in the future based on the past is at best a Fool's errand. Markets never directly repeat
I will ask you this though. Name any Market that you actually believe in that is 70% off of high that you would not go long in. Because right now that's what the Bear argument is. What I think is a lot of people are emotional and when a trend develops they keep thinking it will go and go and go. When I hear Bitcoin 2000 to me it's the same as people saying Bitcoin 100,000 in December. Both of these numbers are sheer greed

tons of regular people have asics. they are most likely found in parts of the world with low power costs. it's hard to predict the exact percentage bitmain has under their control because it's subject to their discretion.  it could be more or less depending on if they want to sell off more asics or keep and mine with what they have. this changes often as it's a risk/reward scenario with them. unless power is dirt cheap right now buying an s9 is not a good investment. it may never ROI for many people. the z9 was a great investment if you got the 1st batch. moving forward it may not be as difficulty rises. keep researching and try not to form opinions. just read and ask questions. sooner or later it will all make sense to you

There is definitely a psychological angle. On Wall Street one of the major causes are interest rates and employment. It just can't move quickly. First you have to work through what caused all the losses and then you have to recover so the time period is natural.
The only major crypto bear Market we had was kind of similar to a Wall Street bear Market. You had an exchange blow up and a lot of very fundamental problems. 
This one however is nowhere near as bad. The only thing that's really holding it up is regulatory clarity. There is fear of the unknown. The thing about that is it could create a market that turns on a dime and surprises people. 
The overwhelming majority of people are very bearish right now. People expect this to be a 2014 repeat. People expect to see $4,800 Bitcoin. That actually might be exactly why it won't happen

Because the short-term can blur your vision. I will point to multiple examples. 2003. 2009. If you look at the past 6 months in either one of those years it looks like everything is falling apart and the fundamental analysis will back it up. However both were turning points and hardly anyone caught it. The best trade of my life I have ever made was in January 2010. I made a fuck ton of money on it and I went against absolutely everyone who subscribed to popular sentiment. 
I completely understand what is scary about crypto. You ask that question. Is this really substantial? Is there really a future to this? Could it all go to zero? Literally this has been the obstacle for the past 9 years. Everyone has been scared of the same things. These are all emotional questions . to date they have a win percentage of 0% people who were scared in 2009 to 2017 and sold at any point outside of December through recently have been wrong.
Again it goes back to what you believe in more. The statistics of the past 9 years or your own feelings

Looking at the price auction I would imagine the rich are just sitting back waiting for the move to exhaust itself. If you wanted to just really destroy the shorts and trap people the thing to do would be to have a coordinated effort with a lot of multi-millionaires that place a market order all at the same time. Something to cause a 20% jump in an hour. Stops may not fill and the shorts would be forced to cover at a much higher price. Their covering would simply add fuel to the fire
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:43:45
this whole thing is going to near zero or it's going much higher. that much is as close to certain as we can expect. the threads from 2014 sound exactly like the ones today which actually gives a LOT of weight to the btc 4\-5k crew. the fundamentals don't matter when you have emotional overload drawing parallels to tulips and dot coms. bitcoin had a larger percentage run in 2013 than it did in 2017 and it recovered and expanded. now exchanges are investing record amounts, institutions are waiting on the SEC and people are in a holding pattern. weak hands are freaking out and selling, then they FUD which makes more people sell and so on. this will continue until it doesn't.

This has screwed with people from the beginning of time. Like if you go back to 2009 and read some of the posts people are like oh wow I got a dollar. Then a few years ago people are like yeah it's going to 50 
Most people have no idea how to Value this but to me it seems pretty easy. You have a finite amount of something everyone wants. Or at least a lot of people want. The more coins that you pull out of circulation the more people will pay for the existing ones. It does not matter if the price is 1000 or 10000 or 100000. It's a decimal point. What does matter is getting people used to a number as history has shown us. That's why I don't really understand these noodles panic selling. There is so much more potential on the upside. So much. If we could get away from these massive 70% or 80% Corrections and develop a real uptrend that lasts a couple years I can't even imagine the amount of people in the amount of money that would come to the space.

of course it's sloppy. unless you're a burn out day trader who gets down to the dollar? 95% of those fail in the long term. i'm not trying the odds. that low was also a wick. not an average low. Also worth bringing up is 2013 started at $20 and the low was still some nine times higher than that. That's a situation we have already went through today
" i think it will go lower than most people think. it always has."
skeptics are nothing new. historically they never make it far in life. maybe you'll be different?
would you sell a bitcoin at $2700 ? if no why do you think you will be able to buy one?
Edit. I just pulled your post history because I was reasonably sure what I was going to find and found exactly that. 3 months ago you were talking about buying up coin on the deal which was considerably higher than where we are. You were in the disbelief denial phase. We have fallen to an even greater low and now you're calling for the floor to fall out.

That last part is speculation and it's really what's holding up the market. The bottom line is people don't really know period in September of last year the only thing that was revealed as they had an account that had money in it to cover the existing tether tokens. That's the last update anyone has received. People do like to assume the worst and it may or may not be true. Again no one really knows. Sooner or later this situation will be found out. I just have no idea when and I have no idea what we'll be found. I do however think it won't be terrible. I will tell you exactly why. Look at the amount of money bitfinex makes every day along with the other exchanges that use tether. Even if they were cooking the books they have had quite some time re inflate them with their own money. It's beyond worth it to do so because if they do not people will have no trust and with no trust that means no more income
Personally I think winning the tether is a security argument would be pretty easy if I was in court. If you feel otherwise I would definitely argue against you. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:26:45
I think you're completely right but it's catering to a smaller and smaller part of the market. I mean how many people don't have a bank account? If you live in the United States, Europe or Australia and don't have a bank account, good luck functioning and on top of that how are you going to send in the cash you have to get to get said token?
As for smaller countries with unstable governments bitmain is already hard at work partnering with circle to create kind of an improved tether. I'm sure some people this will still be attractive. I'm just looking at what the market cap of tether is right now and if I had to guess it's going to be lower in a few years vs higher because there will be more Fiat gateways

That's because it is exactly that. You can look at the Historical Trends and the price of Bitcoin is never under the average cost to mine very long. Yet another angle is what the cost to mine actually is? 
People that have mathematical minds are never going to be satisfied with any answer. Most likely they will just say the price of Bitcoin has nothing to do with the price of mining and on a real black and white level there is truth to that. The thing is if the cost of bitcoin stays under the price to mine more hashpower will shut down and more used miners will go to market. That drastically raises the likelihood of 51% attacks against smaller coins because you will have all this cheap hash power for sale

Hashrate. That's really the issue. The second one is adoption and consumer sentiment. There are so many more people using Bitcoin now than there were when it was at $0.50. For it to head back that direction literally means people have given up on it. The problem with hash power is when the price starts to get down around $4,000 a lot of miners are going to shut down. If they get sold which many of them will what you're going to have is a situation where network hashpower is down and the Pirates now own a lot of what was Network  power. Welcome to the age of 51% attacks. This Will Destroy sentiment even further. There is so much more hashpower out there today than there was years ago.

Yeah there is definitely some weight to that conspiracy theory. If they are found out they definitely would be in prison practically anywhere. It seems like the game plan is to get the books back to being normal and then have an audit or someone come to look at their account and say see the money is all here.

We should know which direction this goes sometime this week. There is a reverse head-and-shoulders tracing out right now. If that pattern completes people are going to see it as technically very positive. It will be a good break above 6800 and should easily continue through 7000. If the pattern fails at a minimum it's probably going to retest 5800. If we get a failure here and start trading into the fives 6000 is going to become a major resistance. ...at least to all the technical traders and there are quite a few of them in this market
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:47:23
They just need to get to the bottom of it. I was listening to a podcast earlier with a couple of professional traders. 15 plus Year backgrounds at the major Wall Street firms. The current rumor that was getting floated is that there was manipulation in the market and what you're seeing and a huge part of this price drop has  been it unwinding. I think bitfinex and the others know eventually they can't continue to run. Once they have cleaned up the books and everything is Peachy there will be some kind of an announcement to say look we have everyone's money here. There are this many tether tokens and we have this many US dollars. The only real problem I can see from the United States perspective is the way tether is right now, it's a security. It's not decentralized. It's a product that you put US Dollars into and expect a return. I have no idea how that one is going to play out but I think this whole usdt thing is going to come to some kind of conclusion over the next 12 to 18 months

On the one hand I'm sorry for your loss. Getting scammed is terrible . on the other you were being a little criminal trying to avoid taxes which by itself can get you fined or potential jail time. 
People have already pointed out a lot of the red flags. The one that should have stood out more than any other was the price they were willing to pay. For example as I type this Bitcoin is trading at $7,700 usd. The absolute most I would consider paying someone cash in person is 6500. I know exactly what the person selling them to me is doing. I also know that offer is likely more than they are going to get because they would not be selling if they were in a low tax bracket. Red flag number two obviously was all of the distraction talk. No one comes to a larger deal and starts rattling on about personal details and if they do it's after the deal is done. Until that happens the focus is on the deal.
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:57:42
Do you mine? Because I do. I'm really familiar with this. 
The reason Bitcoin can never work at those lower prices again is the hashrate. If it's unprofitable for miners they are going to shut off. As that happens the hash rate will go down and the adjustment will take place. However the network just became weaker. This is the problem. When you look at all the hash power that was sold in 2017 alone. Shit if you took all of that and lumped it together you could even attack Bitcoin. That by the way is going to be the last one to go. The real concern is with all the altcoins. If they start getting blown up it's really going to hurt sentiment. The kind of hash power on the market right now is just nowhere near the same as 2016. That's why we can't go back to 2016 prices. Network hash power would fall and difficulty would correct which would make it far more vulnerable. Reread this until you get it if you still aren't getting it.
From the time Bitcoin began in 2009 we have never had a situation where the lowest cost power was unable to be profitable.. bitmain just negotiated a contract in Washington, if it's like a lot of the others it's going to be about four and a half cents a kilowatt hour maybe 5. You can do the math on that to figure out where their bottom line is.

These guys have been making a real effort like all day to really get the Good bullshit going. You check the Post history and there's like this laundry list of comments All saying the same thing in different posts. It's going to zero. It's a Ponzi scheme. Bitcoin would be just the same at $100. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:15:33
No matter which way you go you're taking a leap of faith. That's why so few people are successful. If you're a skeptic you're out. If you base your choices on science and hard facts you're pretty much out. 
There is a risk this whole thing is going to zero. There is a risk there is a ton of unknown manipulation. All of these risks exist. The risks were even greater in the early days. The people who have done well at this have basically put money down and held their nose. They believe in the project but what they really have is faith. So far that has worked but there is always a risk that one day it will not and this whole project will collapse. I personally don't think that but when I do speak with my friends about Bitcoin I get asked that very question quite a lot. Is it possible the whole thing will go to zero? My reply is absolutely. Then they usually look at me with disbelief like how can you put money on that. The thing is by the time it's obvious all the good gains will be gone. I was a kid when the PC Revolution began. Personal computers in the home. That was a foreign idea to so many people. They could not visualize it. They did not believe in it. 
You know what I personally really love about Bitcoin. It's the first time in history Humanity has came up with a monetary system that cannot be hacked and allows Global transfer in theory very quickly. I realize the problems right now but people are at work on addressing those. I also think about the last time I sent someone 250usd with Litecoin. It was a $0.01 transaction fee. The last credit card payment I took was $99 and I received 96 and change

I was just going to say this. As much as people want to believe 2014 is going to be similar to 2018 there is absolutely nothing logical to base that on. You had different people and a completely different fundamental environment. The only thing that is similar is the emotion which is actually a reasonable argument. The thing is the more people you start getting in markets in the more money that comes to them, the less volatile they often get. We are dead smack at a 70% correction right this moment and Litecoin is at 80. There were a couple of brief drawdowns worse than this in 2014 and 2015 but the overall average has already been hit.

Fantastic Four issue 1 is.  mint copy of that is a hundred k
Here's the thing . in December when prices were going gangbusters like nobody was negative. People were having fomo Galore. That's when all of the posts should have been made about fear but of course they were not. Right now you guys all should be greedy but you're not. now you're panicking and thinking this whole thing is going into the ground. 
This situation plays out Time After Time After Time and in practically every market and it's why the majority never makes money
There are one hell of a lot of people on Reddit that bought the top. Lost a good deal of money. Sold. and now they want to see everything burn to the ground. If you guys had any wits about you the situation does not have to play out like this. The dumbest thing you could have done is sell the bottom. The second dumbest thing you could ever do is not get back in at a good price. Cost average if you aren't sure what that is. You have nine years worth of trend saying that you're going to be all right in the long run. You can either follow history or you can follow your emotion and it sounds like you chose the later
Unless you're a piece of shit no one follows Bitcoin just to troll so it's a pretty reasonable assumption at some point you were involved with the market
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:16:37

@_date: 2018-06-27 04:13:29
Not a clue.. the long-term trend is higher. What it's going to do in the next 6 months? Depending on what happens in the next few days we may well be at a triple bottom. If we are not you might see a sell down into the low fives
On the upside we need a real catalyst to break 11.7 convincingly. When that goes the run to 20 is going to be pretty easy
Ideally we would get a Bitcoin ETF. China to reverse the ban on crypto and the lightning Network to start going mainstream. You start putting together events like that and get some positive price momentum and you're going to see a lot of the armchair speculators return to the market. Remember coinbase alone over doubled the number of people they had in just a few months last year. Probably quite a few unused coinbase accounts at the moment. Those are going to get funded lickity-split if they hear about Bitcoin going on a run again. 
A lot of the same people who are too scared to buy at 6000 will gladly buy at 12
Technically the 200-day simple moving average keeps getting lower. That's going to be a good thing when positive momentum begins. We will be on the right side of that before 10,000 which is going to help with taking that out. When 11.7 goes and especially if it goes hard the markets going to be looking at the old all time high again. I have no idea how long this will all take.

It will likely be a much smaller number of people than that. Very simple explanation on why. Let's say for example everyone in here has one Bitcoin. When the price goes to 20,000 some of the people will sell it. When the price goes to 50k even more and so on. By the time the price eventually hits a million dollars very few people are going to have an entire coin let alone 50 of them

I'm not sure I can have a rational discussion with you because this last comment is really out there. Are you sure you don't just have an emotional bias against tether and anything that does not just express pure hatred is going to seem foreign to you?
Usually when people start playing the negative Karma game it's because the other person said something really really dumb or incorrect or the person said something that triggered an emotional reaction
Oh hell I just checked your post and comment history you're just a pessimist. Everything you're posting is negative LOL
Let's see what I have learned about you. You use the word no more than most. You are authoritarian. Talk at people rather than with them. 
I guess I kind of understand where you're coming from on Tether if that's the way your mind operates because right now it's the biggest black mark on crypto. People look at the market cap of it and wonder if there really is that many US Dollars behind it.
Until there is an audit it's all speculation

How cheap is cheap? The only drawback to an S9 is it is going to be replaced very soon. You can tell by all the hashing power on the network. The s9 can only mine one algorithm.

What they may understand now and they did not understand at the time is nobody wants the counterfeit. The counterfeit does not have the development team or the network.

I have a pretty extensive history in markets and was an intern at a firm from 2007 to 2008. 
Crypto is considerably different than traditional markets. The people here are way way way more emotional. I don't like this at all but it is what it is. 
Before I got into this I looked at the chart and I thought yeah that looks like NASDAQ 1999 and of course it was. I waited until the April low to start accumulating and have been nibbling the past day or so. It's impossible to tell if this is a triple bottom or if we are going to have a real leg down. On a long-term perspective you literally have to hold your nose and just say okay I'm going to do this. Buy an amount that's not going to keep you up at night and go on with your life. Just in the past 6 months watching people who trade on YouTube and also online. The health and how long they last is pretty low. The volatile moves blow-up stops really quick. As far as technical analysis in this market goes. Elliott wave is kind of bullshit and a lot of people believe in it. Maybe if you're good with it but it's only useful if you can identify the trend which is what really matters. The 1 day 12 EMA lately has been probably the most accurate technical indicator over the past month. Every time the price has been rising it will bounce off of that like clockwork. That can change at anytime. This is what kills Traders. The human mind is programmed to pick up patterns and in markets the patterns change often very quickly. One indicator may work right now and next month the market may trade heavily on something else. Earlier this year there was even a pattern with the 6th of the month.
Anyway like I was saying if it's getting to your nerves you might have more money than you can afford wrapped up in this. That's going to stress you out and probably lead you to panic sell at the worst time. You need an amount of money that's actually going to make you a return if you're right but not keep you up at night. That amount is different for everyone
If the feeling you're having right now is anything other than, okay this is a good sale. I need to be watching for support to build and accumulate. If you're not thinking that you're having an emotional reaction and need to address it. This is literally a reverse bubble playing out. The only caveat to this is if the majority actually feel crypto is useless and they have no legitimate interest in it. If millions of people suddenly decide they don't like it the party could be over. Stranger things have happened. I mean they delayed the last season of Game of Thrones :)

@_date: 2018-06-30 18:35:56
That's not really a prediction. You have a pivot at 6800. You also have the upper to descending channel line in the 8s as our last rally attempt rejected off 10K. The 200-day moving average while I haven't looked lately should be just under $10,000. Getting on the right side of the curve would put the trading range in that zone. 
The thing about trading and accumulating is you have to realize that you might be wrong. If I'm scaling into a position with buy orders I think about what I would do if everything I'm thinking at that point in time is completely wrong. Plan accordingly
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:30:40

Good Traders are effective because they make snap decisions. If this happens then I do that and if that happens then I do this.

What's really needed is more and more people to come into the market and that's going to happen in an uptrend. I don't know what the numbers are of people bringing money to the market but I'll take a really solid guess that there's a lot more coming in when the market is uptrending. 
Conspiracy theories aside it's pretty obvious to see what drove 2017. Look at all the new people that came to crypto. 
To a degree we tested the limits of the Bitcoin Network in its current state. I'm saying this because of transaction fees. We also expanded mining at a faster point than any time in history. 
Since I'm on that subject this is part of the reason I don't think we're going to have a direct 2014 repeat which is the popular theme on YouTube right now. It's a completely different scenario. Why would you expect the same result?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:06:39
That's actually not true. Tether publicly states that each one is backed by one US dollar. If they did not state this it would be what you say but that's not the case.
The question really is if there was manipulation to what degree? Did they print two for every dollar? Maybe 1.5? And if so is there even any evidence at this point because we have had such a market fall it would not be hard to cover Your tracks if you are an exchange. If bitfinex decides they are going to have an audit you can pretty much bet it's going to pass with flying colors as they will have their books back to being straight again

It's not a competing currency. The US has classified it as a commodity and Europe as far as I know has done the same. It's not exactly competing with the US dollar when it's being quoted in US dollars. For example. You see all the panic in here the past week? One Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin. However Bitcoin is trading lower against the US dollar so people panic.
If you actually spent the time to research this you could listen into some of the audio clips and videos of regulators talking about Bitcoin. Making it illegal is not something they plan on doing

Yeah it's been all over the news man all you have to do is Google it
The February April and this low are all within a couple hundred dollars of each other. To me that's a triple bottom. It's a little sloppy with the bottom hang on this one but it hasn't broke yet
Every time the market sells down around this 6000 point it has held. Now if that changes that's another story but so far so good. I think what you expect is you expect it to break but again it hasn't happened yet. Ethereum and Bitcoin cash still have not penetrated the April  low and the only one that has actually broke down his Litecoin
I have no idea how many are over there but I found this one in about 10 seconds of searching

historically the best thing to do with bitcoin has been to buy it and forget about it. watching the markets daily and stressing are why people who bought in at $5 were thrilled to get $7-10 and so on. also as pointed out those who bought at 1k and sold at 200. history can change but so far the best strategy you can back test is just with the winklevoss twins are doing. accumulate and go on with life

There is a reason they don't do this. It's not profitable. Imagine for a minute you had a hundred thousand Bitcoin. If you just push the sell button on a market exchange the price will indeed drop one hell of a lot. Or, you could wait for better news and you can use what you have to push for things that you know are going to draw in people and then when it goes on a tear you can slowly start selling some of your coins into the strength. The Winklevoss twins are a great example of this. They have a ton of Bitcoin. They can sell everyone they have right now and they would have made just a ridiculous profit. They don't because they know they would literally be selling the bottom. 
If you have a couple hundred dollars in your bank account right now I know it probably sounds cool to think that if you had 50 Bitcoin or whatever you could just sell them at this price and your lifestyle would be quite a lot better. That's true and people have. That said a lot of these large wallets are held by people who don't have to worry about money anymore. It's numbers on a screen and just like an 80s video game when you are trying to run up points. The whole goal is to get as many points as possible

You guys assuming you're going to know when that's going to happen are completely changing the context of my post. What I originally said is if you could choose to have it happen tomorrow or in the future did not mean you would know it was actually going to happen. No one has any idea what the market  is going to do the next day or the next year. We can guess but you're not going to borrow against your house to buy more Bitcoin in any realistic scenario. Waiting simply means you have more time to collect more assets. Getting caught off guard tomorrow means you're going to run into a massive difficulty increase when everyone and their dog starts mining and you may not have as much coin as you want to have especially since those of you who have been around awhile probably sold most of it last year
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:32:16
You're guessing. I'm going to point to the price action we're having right now against that because if you say the price movement up to 20,000 was unnatural what exactly is it we are experiencing now?
There is another answer to both of these equations and it lies with a bunch of emotional people. There was a bubble to 20,000 and now we have a reverse bubble. This is how gamblers work. If they make money at something they will throw more and more and more money at it until it blows up. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:01:15
It would but it would collapse in a very structured way. People would just be withdrawing their US dollars. The only reason this would be a problem is if there's not enough US dollars to cover the tether which is kind of what the whole discussion about tether has been about for the past few months. We can only hope the exchanges have been smart enough to cover their tracks and re-fund the tether if there were ever any shenanigans
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:39:33
You get a six-month warranty but that's besides the point because the warranty is terrible. GPU mining is what you do in Europe and America and Australia for that matter. The altcoins definitely have swings but consider this. If you buy a 1080ti right now and throw it in your computer... right now you can sell that hashing power for .0003 Bitcoin per day. That's right now and that's really low. That gives you a payoff of about a year if you get a decent deal on the card like say 699 USD. What you're actually doing is cost averaging in every single day. If the price goes up it's going to be fewer days before you break even and if we go lower than this you know what that means but at least you're cost averaging in. You also have the recovery cost you can get from selling the card

From what they have said Each one is supposed to be back by 1 US dollar which means for every one they print there is a dollar behind it. Of course like we've been talking about that's the problem on if there actually is. If there are no buyers that is no big deal they can destroy the tether and redeem the US dollars to shrink the overall Supply. None of this is a problem as long as there is actually enough money for each one that is in existence right now. All of this is also not going to happen overnight so tether is going to be in play for a Time.

@_date: 2018-06-13 21:25:52
no there aren't 2/3rds of those aren't being traded. they are in solid hands. that leaves 7\+ billion people and roughly 5 million bitcoins in float. of the 5 million in float it's anyone's guess how many of those are in jittery hands.  i definitely support flushing out the gamblers. dropping the price to a point flushes out the people who don't actually believe in what bitcoin is. that said 4500\-5000 is where trouble would start forming. miners would shut down and all that mining equipment may well get sold and when it does you now have more mining equipment on the market at low prices and lower network hashpower. bitcoin cash is especially at risk here. 51&amp; attack headlines compromise the faith of investors and wreck markets. in other words, going too low really puts a damper on it ever going back up simply because of the chaos it would create. also note the 2014 bear market low was the cost of production. today that number varies but 5\-6k is the majority. if we drop to 5k going to 50k in the next 3\-10 years is possible. if we drop to 2k going to 20k in 10 years seems unlikely. undercutting the mt gox blow up for no real reason would remove any sort of fundamental analysis from the market.
lastly. keep in mind. we are downtrending. most people are TERRIBLE at reversals. when the market was going up last year everyone was mooning. then denial came. now we are in the anger and disbelief phase. next is depression and giving up. 5k is in play. much under that....it's really not. not if this market is to survive

encarta was a successful business until wikipedia did everything they did only in a free, easier to use manner
show me something that replaces bitcoin because everything people are arguing is currently tied to it
ether? it goes up and down with bitcoin. bitcoin cash? it goes down more when bitcoin falls and often up more when bitcoin rises. litecoin? the original bitcoin junior.
some of the token projects look interesting. icon is one. however, it's not decentralized. the world has not agreed on it's value. it has no history. bitcoin and bitcoin only has 9 going on 10 years of growth and adoption. hell even roger ver still owns actual bitcoin when people have asked him about it. privacy projects like monero are hard to predict  large scale. governments may get nervous about them.
so which one of your examples has grown for 10 years again and failed? the only one you could even attempt to argue is the encyclopedia and that happened because they refused to adapt. let's just say the LN fails and developers move away from bitcoin. pretty high chance roger and friends will seize the opportunity. if someone only bought bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin they would have pretty much all the potential paths at this current time. if another rises in the future, cool ! but it hasn't yet. lots of hype and marketing but little use case
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:49:34
has it dawned on many of you that the strategies we are seeing are designed to make people give up? sells offs shake out one group of people. now we have a low volatility environment that will shake out the traders
meanwhile you can mine or buy and accumulate without trouble.
seriously. exchanges are investing untold millions in expanding. network hashpower is WAY up probably due to next gen asics being used in secret.
the price run is an exit strategy and happens when the larger players have had time to build up a nice stack buying the dead markets and mining. a good uptrend is established and another year long run begins to draw in the masses which provide the money flowing in to further support the price run and then you sell into that strength. it may be a year or two or three. don't stress over it. accumulate and wait.
this market just destroys ADHD mindsets
before 2021 you're going to hear about SEC regulations and they will most likely be favorable in the long term. more money will flow in. a bitcoin etf could bring countless billions. if the LN is perfected by then you have the scenario for 100k or more and even at 100k it would be the SMALLEST percentage gain between peaks we have ever seen. 2013 was 1k and 2017 was 20 fold, even 10 fold from 2017 would be 200k a coin. add in the halving and you have a very long term bull case for those who can be patient and just not stress over it...this probably eliminates 90\+&amp; of people just like it did 2009\-2017
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:44:33
The next question at that point is did you buy earlier that year? Because if you didn't that just makes you a no coiner that for some reason follows Bitcoin. If you did and you sold into the strength. that's awesome.
The following question would then be why are you so anti Bitcoin now? You're 70% off the highest if you go back to 2009 in every instance except one that has been a killer buy point
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:22:40

imo the real fear is what's under the blankets when the USA goes looking. people don't know....or maybe they do and that's why they are selling? at any rate the tiny exchange i agree is FUD. the SEC on the other hand. legitimate fear...however. long term, it's bullish as people will feel FAR more comfy investing larger sums if they know it's a fair market

There are a lot of professional people in here. If you make 5 to $10,000 a month you probably have more than $100 in crypto if you visit this Reddit. If I had to guess I would say the numbers get pretty small when you start getting above 50000 crypto because if you had that much chances are you've been in since at least 2016 and you sold a lot of it sometime last year.

That would make a ton of sense if a few coins had been moved over the years. What is suspicious is not a single fraction has been touched. Like if I had a million coins and I truly cared about the market more than anything. Well it's obvious what I would do. I would sell 10 or 20 or even a couple hundred at a time. I would buy a nice house and a new Nissan GTR. But I would not dump. No way. I think most people are a lot like this
However there's no way I would be able to look at billions of dollars and not take a cent. Could you do that?

@_date: 2018-06-23 05:59:24
If I'm going to blame something it's going to be all the fud. All the speculators and gamblers who don't really give a shit about the technology or adoption are selling out now because they think it's going to zero. They think it's a Ponzi scheme and they are going to run for the door
I'm really really curious if 6K is going to hold. If it does Deep Pockets are most likely keeping it up which of course makes sense beings they are more concerned with the number of coins they hold than they are the price today
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:51:37
I don't think people are doing this to get off. I think they are doing it to free up coins. If they dump the herd follows. This drives the price even lower and allows them to buy in should they want to at a lower price. People are reacting to what happened today for example. Last night they may not have been selling. The overwhelming majority of Bitcoin are already in strong hands and Cycles like this free up even more. Once the majority of coins are in strong hands the price can be set wherever they want it to be. There is no risk at that point because no one is going to be dumping outside of the select few who hold the coins. By this point people will fomo and go for whatever scraps they can get. That provides the perfect liquidity to sell into. I mean if I had a ton of money and I was looking to get even more wealthy that's exactly what I would do
Selling large quantities now is just retarded. All the retail investors are terrified. That's not what the game plan is right now. No way
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:07:30
Right now I'm more inclined to set a buy at 6900. If this inverse head-and-shoulders we have tracing out right now actually has a bull break it needs to go through that number pretty hard to get the technical traders onboard. If we drop under 6,000 and retest 5800 and go through that 6000 is likely to become resistance.. from there it is somewhat unpredictable where the market will find support. I would be in the wait and see camp. It could crack lower or it could whipsaw and just run traders in. 
Accumulating for the long-term make sense at this price. I mean we are 70% off the high. But I would not trade it until we have clear Direction. It's ripe for a reversal with a downtrend in place. I don't have the foggiest idea which side is going to win this

Every Market is like this . I would not be surprised if we spend nearly a year between 6 and 10000
Something to think about it ahead of time though. If there is enough of an uptrend to bring us back up above 6000 do you really want to sell? You have quite some time to ponder that

A few of us were talking about what you just said earlier. It's probably going to take Wall Street to start the rally and it's probably going to take more time because people have to rebuild their credit and save up some money again. On top of that with each day that goes by more new people come to the scene. Personally, I think once we reclaim $6,000 you will see a lot of appropriate optimism. Until then I don't really have a personal feeling on Direction but if someone really made me choose I would say the bottom is probably not in

If you're still holding the single best thing you can do if you're feeling like this is literally turn off your brain. Forget you own whatever you own. Go jump on a mountain bike. Bang some girls. Literally forget about crypto and let what you have sit. In a year or two you will probably see a news headline that says something ridiculously bullish. At that point check your account  reanalyze the trend. 
Is there a risk this is all going to zero? Absolutely. Now if you just can't handle that thought do what you have to do but realize, just based on that comment you made to me there is some emotion in you about all of this. Feelings are deadly when it comes to financial markets.

it can't. if it did it would have to be reborn as something else. do you have any idea of the math behind hashpower and how the network operates? prices under the cost of production can collapse the market especially under 2k or so. there would be massive numbers of 51&amp; attacks and a near freefall to zero

But, yeah if you get down to it Bush was worse. I'm just thinking about actual events and he was probably the worst president in my lifetime. He fabricated evidence to go to war. Really let inflation run. What we got out of bush was a very expensive War and the price of durable goods increasing greatly
However, you don't have little gangs of people running around to talking about Bush being the best thing ever. That is what makes Trump a bit unique. Some people literally see him like their favorite sports team and that should be concerning

I just like the idea of such a widespread push to market. When you get down to it a lot of people have heard of Bitcoin but very few really know what it is or have ever used it. I think this will help that

That's not really true since you always funds in your coinbase pro waiting for opportunity. 
You upload whatever amount you feel like and then you just wait. When a good buy opportunity comes up you take advantage of it but you always have funds on the side waiting or orders on the books at Key price points

Exactly. Like what you said is spot-on.
I'm hopeful this doesn't lead to a war but there is one thing it definitely is leading to. People are losing the ability to think for themselves. There is a large group of people that agree with everything their respective political party says. If you're left you think this this and this and if you're right you think that that and that. People get really defensive over it.  Even more bizarre is many of them have trouble really arguing their points, especially on the right.  you may notice what I said above had a couple of people clicking the downvote button but not a single one of them could really argue what Trump has done for them or what policy has affected them in a beneficial way. They cannot identify policy decisions they agree with or argue them. It's literally all about reality show TV to them. He is their favorite character. Talking critical of him is kind of like talking bad about someone on Game of Thrones that they like. You literally get the same kind of reaction

I know it's fun to go and think corporate media and the globalists are against you but this appears to be more of a coordinated effort by a group of people who are reporting the videos of these content creators on a massive level. Google operates heavily on algorithms and if they get flags from thousands of accounts this is what happens it could be someone wanting to create panic and collapse all those bitfinex longs or it could just be a group who is disgruntled and doing it because they can. It's honestly surprising that no one has used this exploit before. 
There was a recent algorithm change at YouTube designed to address the fake news problem. I mean some of the channels especially in politics literally just invent things to Keep Their audience tuned in. It's just a little weird that we have a group taking credit for taking down all these videos right at the same time there was an algorithm change at YouTube. Give it a couple weeks I bet all of this returns to normal As YouTube addresses the issue
@_date: 2019-12-25 21:16:15
All the current evidence points to a group that is pretty much harassing and targeting crypto content creators. Eric krown posted a few screenshots of messages he received from the blackmailers. It sounds like bot armies are going after the reporting algorithm and these videos are getting auto flagged. If this is what it actually is within a week or so YouTube should address it and everything will be back to normal

This is a little bit misleading since the majority of people using coinbase use coinbase Pro. There is no option for cash app pro. If you're in this for the long game you don't make knee-jerk reactions and buy on the standard coinbase

Twitter is pretty toxic and just a terrible discussion platform. It's a small group of people who get their dopamine hit going off on rants and or trying to talk their position. For example if they sell all the posts are Bitcoin going down. If they just bought all the posts are bullish. Then they sit back and see how many likes they get . There are actually quite a few liberal people I've met in Bitcoin who are just attracted to it because of the sound money principal. They just don't participate very often on Twitter running their mouths. Bitcoin is somewhat apolitical these days

I'm not sure how closely some of you guys have paid attention but I have been in this space a little before the 2017 run. What caused a lot of that was Leverage. It's hard to tell where the point of organic accumulation turned into Trader Leverage but if you look at some of the statistics Willie woo has shown with accumulation distribution of fund flows. There really wasn't that much net buying late 2017 and there wasn't that much selling into 2018. What you had was traders on the leverage late 2017 and deleveraging into 2018. Now we have that plus token Ponzi blowing up that has put more Supply on the market. This is a temporary event that will work itself through. There is a double whammy coming up with the halving along with the ponzi's being exhausted. That's going to greatly restrict Supply and if I was a Trader that's the time frame I would be looking at for a technical confirmation. Somewhere late in 2020 you should start seeing signs of a supply constriction.  Then you will get the waves of people who are too scared to purchase now but will gladly pay three times as much if the trend is going up. I mean the math even checks out with a strong run into  2021 which goes along with the four your cycle. What's really impossible to tell is what price we are going to go to. There is no way to predict that. The only thing you can look for is a strong Trend that goes parabolic making very rapid gains within a week or two after an extended run. That is typically how tops get put in

The problem is how you convert it to Monero because if you use an exchange that transaction is going to be linked to you.

Based on the current evidence I have seen I don't think this YouTube problem is going to be ongoing though. In other words I don't think YouTube has Human Resources pulling these videos. It appears to be an algorithm attack from a group wanting to get some good pessimism in the crypto circles. Basically there are mass reporting these videos with a bot Army. At the same time bitfinex Longs are at an all-time high so you can kind of get an idea where they are going

Why could someone have not made the same argument in December? Or even last month? If there is no reason for it to be worth more than it is today why was the same argument not in play a month ago?
Truthfully what happens is when the market is doing well and the prices going higher everyday People pull out all kinds of reasons to explain why that's happening and why it's going higher. When the market is selling off people do exactly the opposite. This is why Bitcoin has been around for 10 years and really not that many people have made a good deal of money on it. The psychology kills the average person and they do exactly the wrong thing every single time.

Realistically no one knows. This is being manipulated by a few people.
If you want to look at something to get kind of a rough idea of maybe what happened in the past and how it is looking to shape out in the future look at January 2015 to jan 2016. Then look at today. If you look at the stochastic and you look at where we are on the Bands. It's really uncanny how similar it is playing out. Like I laughed at these comparisons all year because markets don't repeat. But they actually seem to be.... if this goes just like last time we're going to continue to sell off and create a wick on the monthly candle. We're then going to resume a flat trading range into next summer having another retest of the low along the way. Around the ltc halving you will start to see prices perk up. If that actually happens it's going to be ridiculous because that's what happened last time.

If you're the type of person that sells when things go to hell you're going to have a lot of trouble in forex. Selling now is an emotional decision because a responsible Trader would have had stop losses at 5500. 
In forex you have to trade. With Bitcoin you have the luxury of knowing it's cyclical and things fundamentally are nowhere near as bad as 2015. If you would have studied the market you would know that things like this are not out of the ordinary and it's also the reason why Bitcoin has been around 10 years and you only have a virtual handful of people who have made good money.

@_date: 2018-11-21 18:10:26
Let's think about mining for a minute. Cost of production for bitmain is about 2500. The s15 does 28th and probably a little bit better if you optimize and overclock. Most 16nm are 14th with cost of production at $5,000 in an optimized environment. All these mining outfits that are producing around those numbers are very unlikely to upgrade. That's going to drop the network hashrate and it's going to reduce the difficulty. Guess who benefits from that?

You know what caught my attention. Like when I first noticed Bitcoin. Statistics. The probability of an item or object repeating what it's done in the past is far higher than not. Then I started looking at the usefulness and especially the Rarity. Next you look at the millennials. People under 30 and especially under 25. They are very wrapped around cryptocurrency. I saw a finite object with demand and a statistical probability of appreciation. 
I later found out one of the Winklevoss twins said exactly the same thing I did. Well he probably said it before I realized it but he said this whole thing is either going to make us some real money or go to zero. I had the same thought

But that is human nature. Most people do the wrong things at the wrong times. It's why the majority of Traders are net negative after a year. If you want to play really really good odds. Buy an amount of Bitcoin you can seriously afford to lose. Like legitimately lose. Put it on a hardware wallet and go do something else with your life for a few years. That strategy has been ridiculously effective
Odds of success at trading. 5 to 10%
Odds of success at what I just said. Ten year history says 100%
Can that change? Absolutely. But what odds do you want to play?
I'm going to mention something that should be obvious but sometimes needs to be pointed out. If you want to learn how to do absolutely anything. Find someone who is really good at it and copy what they do. Look at the people who have made a lot of money in Bitcoin. look at the people who have lost a lot of money in Bitcoin. Choose which one you want to imitate

An extremely limited Supply and a lot of interested people. A lot of people like the chase price good what usually goes on or what has gone on since Bitcoin was created is people will accumulate them. that starts taking more and more Supply off the market. Eventually you get to this point where the price begins being pushed up. People take notice and then they start buying. this can feed on itself for years. Same thing happens on the downside which is what we are currently experiencing. It also happens with gold and silver. Even real estate
There is quite a lot of money on the sidelines waiting for an uptrend to begin

because most people are impatient. They have no concept of years. I was chatting with a guy earlier on a trading forum. Presented the historical odds and the most successful method. Historically it has been to load up when people panic and you get these ridiculously oversold stochastic levels on the monthly bar. It's exactly how you trade the S&amp;P 500 long-term as well. He's like how long do you think that will take? I say it could be as long as 2023. He just couldn't imagine waiting that long and went back to the one minute bars trying to gamble. Maybe he gets something, maybe he doesn't. The odds however are stacked against him

Just in case any of you aren't aware how Fiat works. Like truly works. This is completely sustainable. Let me explain. Since the US dollar has Reserve currency status most everything is pegged against  that. You can accumulate all of the debt you want. You can do pretty much anything you want. The dollar will adjust to whatever the variables are. Without getting really in-depth and explaining every angle what matters to you as Citizens is if wages into the price of goods keep Pace with that or if you get left behind. Looking back to even 1980 it's more expensive to buy a house. It's more expensive to go to college. The cost of real hard Goods like that is more expensive and there is no sign that that trend is going to stop. In return you get cheap electronics and a lot of gadgets but that's peanuts compared to the big picture. 
I think the youngest generation is going to look at things like Bitcoin as a hedge. It's a fixed Supply and scarce object. The real test is going to be if it can maintain and increase its value over the next 10 to 20 years. If it does and people catch on they will all buy a little sliver of Bitcoin and turn that into a savings account

It is substantially lower than that. 7nm on .03c kwh power has a 1 in front of it. The average honestly doesn't matter. What matters are the miners that are most efficient.
If you're looking at this from a price perspective there are literally two ways to play the market. Number one wait for a decisive break above 6000. Number two wait for a capitulation bottom to actually be put in. The signals and signs of one are very obvious if you know what you're looking for
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:07:56
The price to mine it in some of the most efficient places in the world right now is in the low $1,000 range. As more and more unefficient miners get out of this that could actually go lower.
If you're going to look at a metric the network value to transaction is probably a better one than mining.
If we have a capitulation bottom it's going to be obvious you're going to see things sell off and you're going to see people panicking and forced to sell. It's highly possible that some large hands want to see bitmain broken and the bch project destroyed. this would land a lot of stability to Bitcoin in general as they have been the most toxic asset in the space. I said this in another post but there are literally two smart ways to play Bitcoin right now. One of them is by when we decisively close over 6,000. The other is wait for a capitulation event or capitulation bottom to actually form. You want the price to go down to a lower level on extremely high volume and then rock it back up. The chart in February 2018 is actually what capitulation looks like even though that one was not the actual bottom. Having something like that happen again really increases the odds that we have hit a bottom. You have the massive percentage decrease and you also have the technical capitulation which means people are forced to sell. I seriously think breaking roger and bitmain are likely primary goals of this bear Market. It's always going to be a thorn in the side if we recover and they are still around

The most skeptical question you need to ask yourself is simply this. Why does it need to exist? That is the most powerful argument against it. Why does Bitcoin specifically need to exist.

That makes sense until you look at the rest of the world. It's actually much worse off. When you look at the u.s. dollar Index or Forex pairs the US dollar is like top of the mountain right now.  It's really not just the United States, it's the entire Global industry. Inside the United States neither political party has any interest in slowing down the spending. One party wants social programs and benefits for the poor and middle class. Another one's tax breaks for the elites and the wealthy. No matter which way you stack it neither one has any interest in reducing spending unless it's with programs they aren't interested in

You can look for that and start buying in there or you can wait for us to decisively break above 6000 and buy that which means closing weekly candles above 6k. 
So to sum it up I'm either waiting for the bust or I'm waiting for a recovery to begin. 6K is absolutely nothing. That's not a boom. That's a start. A boom is getting above 20k and sustaining it heading for 50
@_date: 2019-01-30 14:35:04
You're completely missing what I said. It's not the real price number it's what the price number represents. 6000 was the breakdown area. getting back above that completely changes the psychology of the market. Going lower is going to happen until the market finds the bottom. Right now the psychology of the market is the biggest problem. A lot of people don't feel comfortable because we keep trending lower. Even if we have some unusual situation like the market just kind of makes a hover bottom and begins trending higher you would see it on the moving averages and right now they are all pointing down
If you really want to educate yourself on price action. There's one guy on YouTube that's worth following and gives daily explanations of what's going on and you can kind of take it in. Krowns crypto cave. The guy was a market-maker on the NYSE that now just trades Bitcoin. Start taking that in on a daily basis. After a few months it will all start making sense

Politically there is definitely a problem. The division in the country is destructive. tent cities in California are nothing new they literally have existed my entire life. The effects of climate change are starting to become more pronounced in California. Like when I was a kid we never had fires like this here. Now it's a yearly occurrence. We have a lot more days above 90f. I mean I've literally watched it with my own eyes. Average temperatures are warmer and places that used to be Lush and green are now dry. 
As far as the rest of it goes. The global economy does have fractures but the United States is in a better position than pretty much everyone else in the world. You're going to see places like Italy and turkey come apart first and so far they haven't. One thing about Fiat money is you can inflate it to Infinity which allows the World Bank to keep rescuing these countries. The problem for us is it means the standard of living will fall because our dollars keep inflating when it comes to real purchasing power. I mean it's hard to overlook the massive Run in real estate prices in the western world. It's hard to overlook the increase in college costs in the western world. There is no sign of that Trend stopping

Thought about it. You know. It reminds me of the 2016 presidential election in America. There were these massive troll armies with disinformation campaigns. The obvious goal was to try and discredit the opponent period with crypto it's almost like they want to drive out as many people as possible in order to buy at the best price possible. The line of bullshit of trying to warn people is obviously fake. Since when has Society ever tried to look out for one another? That leaves you with the potential of jealousy or bitterness possibly because of loss or you have a disinformation campaign orchestrated by certain parties
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:24:15
Actually it totally does. If you dollar cost average into the stock market or into real estate or into any other asset, overtime you do well. Markets are far more likely to repeat then they are to abruptly change. With Bitcoin there will be obvious warning signs if things are really going to go south. Exchanges will stop expanding. You will hear about the Winklevoss twins getting out of their stake. None of that is happening. Everyday more and more people are coming to crypto. It's not a market for weak minds or weak hands. 
If you are someone who just can't live with the loss on paper you're either going to have to use stop losses and repeatedly take positions or you're going to have to wait until an established uptrend is in place.

Most of the time no. When you have a major break out like this it's often the sign of a reversal. The resistance points are at 7800 and 9800. With the amount of pressure we had coming out of this 7800 is pretty likely to get broken and then you just watch to see what happens at 9800 or somewhere in between. 8500 may be another pivot 
If you bought during the lows at 5700 to 6000 you can always scale out of positions. Take some of your position off right now. Take a little bit more at 7800. Maybe 20% at each point and scale out the higher it goes.

You guys can look at how the market is pricing the stuff in on Forex or even the u.s. dollar Index. While you can make a lot of scary arguments. The fact of the matter is the rest of the world is scarier. If there is going to be a debt default you're going to see it start in Europe, probably in Italy, turkey and a few other select the nations. The Fed is absolutely In Cahoots with the world bankers. If that goes it will be because they have a replacement and there is no evidence of that in the near future. If some of the smaller countries default they are going to get rescued by the world bank and then they are going to owe the World Bank a favor. Or they are just going to owe the World Bank a lot of their country. It's hard to say how that's going to play out

Yes actually because the volatility truly can be set at any level you want it to be since we have futures. For example if you want to have a slightly long bias you could do 60% long 40% short and that's just on pure Bitcoin what if you have a fund that is made up of a lot of Diversified asset classes and only 1% of your money is in Bitcoin. Now if it does well you gain something and if it does poorly it's not going to affect the overall fund that much. There are all kinds of ways to use it effectively in a major investment.

Outright socialism. Absolutely. Works great if you're kind and look out for one and other. Would fail terribly in society. The problem at least in America is where to have the middle ground. Schools are socialism. Think we have ignorant people in the population now could you imagine what it would be like without public schools. Police. Fire. Parks etc. All that is socialism. We all pay part of our income for it. 
If we socialize college and healthcare taxes go up. To some ot would be a good deal. To others it would suck. This is why I don't see an agreement happening. 
Peroanally I'd just like to see the wasteful spending reduced. Drugs don't need to be illegal. You could have a treatment center in every city for a sliver of the dea and prison budget. Let people make their own choices. Cut corporate welfare. Let people feel free again.

Are you seriously trying to argue for economic collapse? That's what you consider a win because that's what would have happened in 2009 If the Fed would not have stepped in. Now you might not be aware of this but the president, at least every president except this current man child leave the FED to themselves. The monetary policy you saw in 2009 is what kept the recession somewhat mild. It's what prevented a 75% drawdown. The risk of a global domino effect was so great in 2009 people were genuinely concerned about their own standard of living completely falling apart. 
If you're going to try and fault Obama personally because you're an Alex Jones party Warrior at least pick something that has some Merit. If I was going to argue the right-wing point of view I would probably start with Obamacare being pushed through before it was a realistic product that would work long-term and I would also have made sure that I had some degree of bipartisan support. National Healthcare is a wonderful idea as  standard of living is more important than dollars but the implementation of that policy was a bit lacking.
If you are extremely wealthy I can understand being a republican because you benefit from their policies. If you're working class I have no idea why you're voting against yourself. Those tax cuts we have going on now are a big inflationary Catalyst and I'm personally not going to get a damn thing from them. I would much rather see that money go to schools or Healthcare or pretty much anything that myself or my neighbor would benefit from.  Not corporate welfare. Yes both parties do like to spend but where that money goes is completely different places

The best time in the world to buy any Equity or commodity is when everyone hates it.
The part that cracks me up is the news is freaking Bliss right now. I mean it's really bullish and you still have an overwhelming amount of people scared out of their minds. That's about the most perfect trade setup a person can ask for. I have been buying the living shit out of Bitcoin with all my extra money the past month. It was just ridiculously obvious.

Oh we can try to look for reasons and rationale but for everyone that you find there will be another example of someone who is similar that got a different result. What it comes down to is the justice system is made up of people. For example if someone did a crime and you and I were both judges. What do you think the odds are we would come to the same understanding on what the sentence should be? Like you try the case over in your house and I try the case in mine. The probability of us having a different result is very high and that happens in court constantly

I try and keep an open mind if there are any quality ones. Justin amash is a really decent Republican. For the most part though it's a very backwards party. 
On a consumer level the party is typically more inflationary as well. The bush wars were the most inflationary scenario of my lifetime. You may have noticed the price of a can of soup doubled in the eight years he was in office. One major problem with the Consumer Price Index is it strips out food and energy which are two of the main areas people feel inflation. If I had the gas I would say this is done so the government can report lower inflation figures than we are actually experiencing
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:01:43
Possibly but you're not really sure until you see a higher high. If you look at the chart from the peak we have this series of lower highs and basically stable lows. That creates a triangle looking wedge pattern. Those normally break one side or the other eventually.
What you want to see is the price action break 9800 which is where we fell last time. Going to 7500 and falling especially if we fall hard would be bearish. It's just another lower high. Even sideways action would be fine. We just ideally want to break this pattern of forming lower highs

We're not going to see drugs in general legalized anytime soon. Maybe in the future they will start treating it like a health problem rather than a Law Enforcement issue but it's going to be years and years and years down the road. You would have to get a very liberal president and put the Supreme Court back to a left-leaning bias which is going to take a generation.

I'm not sure about that one. I think a lot of big business is very aware of inflation and that's all you would create if you increase the supply of Bitcoin. The only way I can see them doing it is if you took a really far-fetched thought like trying to pre mine or something to put all of those new coins in their pockets in which case they would basically just be stealing

The US dollar is not a direct asset in the way that you're referring to it. When you print money you do a couple of things. Stimulating growth is one of the big ones which is why the low interest rates we saw back in 2008 we're so necessary. When the housing crisis happened to the Federal Reserve was in a real situation. They either printed money and dropped the interest rates through the floor to try and stimulate growth or they faced potential economic collapse. This is why you saw a national debt increase but inflation not really do a whole lot. In fact in 2009 inflation was very low. If they tighten the money supply that will strengthen the US dollar which allows us to buy more goods from other countries. But it also makes our goods a lot more expensive for other countries to buy. This is the constant balancing act you see playing out on the Forex Market.
The benefit to something like this is the recession that we had in 2009 was pretty mild for a lot of people. You still had food on the table. You still had a house. If we would have had a fixed monetary supply aka the gold standard you would have had a Great Depression situation play out all over again. There would have been no way to artificially prop up the economy and it would have taken much much longer to work through. At the end of the day standard of living is what's most important to most people. 
This is why I don't think Bitcoin is ever really going to replace the US dollar but it can work alongside it. At least it's not going to replace it with our current financial model and the entire world is tied to that so really you all better hope that it does not because if it did it means the world as we know it would be collapsing. That might be fun in the video game Fallout but many of you would die and you would have very very hard lives. You ever try to plow a field with an ox?

It's not something we really have control over. American governments and Western European governments have shown a fairly open-minded to bitcoin. China on the other hand shut it down. 
Those with power will always continue to do what is in their own interest. The big draw to bitcoin I see is you have a major inflation hedge. You have a deflationary currency with a fixed supply. What it may turn into in the future could be different but right now it's gold 2.0.

10 years down the road if you have one you're going to be a one percenter
Keep in mind the longer this goes on the more of them that find their way into strong hands. As that happens the price is going to naturally rise. Every single day someone new learns about Bitcoin and they buy a little piece. People sometimes complain because the rate of that has slowed down since 2017 but it is still in full effect. For the past 9 years the best thing someone could have done is get their hands on a bit of Bitcoin and kick back. I don't see any evidence to change that thesis. The only one that could is if the lightning network never works on a large scale. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 23:54:07
I don't even worry about it honestly. Bitcoin is something I knew when I got into it was a product that I would start mining and just accumulate. My price of production is about 4200.
You can back test other strategies like buying Bitcoin anytime it's under the 200-day moving average and looking at the performance a year later. Very successful.
Why are you questioning back testing strategies just because you're guessing that the future might be completely different. While the future is unknown human behavior is often very predictable. A person has to develop some kind of feeling and doing nothing just means you get left behind or you fomo ... well unless you believe it's going to zero and if you're like that why are you even here?
Historically it looks like after every Market rally and major correction there is a group of people who questions if Bitcoin is going to zero. These people are necessary for the market. That doubt is what provides the floor. Once they have all sold stability is once again found.  
Right now is the longest Bitcoin has went sideways this entire year. We are either going to get above 6800 or below 6 for a next move. Above 6800 seems more likely. No counter rally since April. Then you just watch to see if we get a higher high or high or low. The number to beat is 9800.  If we fall off 75 then all eyes are on if 57 holds or if we go down to 53ish tracing out a multi prong bottom. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:48:52
It's not strawman at all about 2008. First off the FED is not political which kind of throws that argument right out the window. Second off they took a lesson from the Great Depression and made sure they didn't repeat it. Deflation collapses business. Inflation can be controlled and if you look at where the inflation numbers were coming in in 2009 they were lower than they have been in decades. Had the FED not chosen to do what they did we would have had a wide-scale depression. Furthermore Ben Bernanke was the head of the fed from 2006 until 2014. That was a bush appointee and he was a very good fed chairman. Had that situation been handled differently we could have very easily seen 20% unemployment
Also consider how terrible the world would be if everyone thought like you do. It would be survival of the fittest and chances are you would not survive. It would be a repeat of the turn of the 20th century when most wealthy dominated everything and the masses worked for scraps.

I kind of gave up on calling these guys out. I don't know if they are just a marketing campaign or trolling. There's a group of people that has just a massive post history of doing nothing but talking shit about crypto. 
No rational person follows something that they don't believe in and don't care about just to talk badly about it with this sort of frequency.
The only thing that made sense to me is they are looking to get in but want to do all they can to drive their entry point as low as possible. It's like all of these three to four thousand price predictions. I mean maybe? I don't have a crystal ball either but when you throw out low-ball dollar amounts generally it makes people, if they listen to you, fearful. That means they aren't going to be buying the dip and if that's what you want to do it's not a bad strategy to keep their hands off the cookie jar while you load up
The overwhelming majority of posters seem to have a feeling that goes something like this. I'm bullish on Bitcoin in the long term but I'm not sure about right now. The second all these people realize that if a bunch of people are looking to go long, it's probably not a bad idea to hop in; because once the masses start doing it again. ... .Well I'm just going to take a stab at it but the price that you see right at this moment is going to be less than what you will be paying then

1. you live in the usa, canada or europe most likely. this doesn't exist everywhere
2. merchants are paying 2-4&amp; to take those debit/credit cards
3. this whole crypto move is still in the beta phase.
4. it, when refined, will still be less expensive to send transactions on the blockchain not to mention safer and faster. banks don't actually clear those transactions instantly. they may credit you instantly but it takes days to clear.
5. by the time a good idea is obvious to everyone and developed there is no more money in it. if you look at what bitcoin was in 2010 and what it is in 2018 you have just massive growth. you're investing in a fast growing emerging market. this kind of volatility is not uncommon. when china first got going hard around Y2k there were just massive swings in many of the companies on their stock exchange as well.
6. bitcoin is limited to a handful of coins for the entire world. what, maybe 18m at capacity. millions are forever lost. every millionaire in the world will not be able to own a full one. if this catches on mainstream as a store of value OR digital cash or both the value will be as hard to comprehend as 6k was in 2010

The way it's most often done is you deposit an amount of Bitcoin which gives you that much margin. You then basically borrow to sell. If the price goes down you can buy back the Bitcoin you borrowed and keep the difference. If the price goes up when you have to give the Bitcoin back you will be paying more for it out of pocket
When you hear about people getting liquidated it would go something like this. If they deposit $500 worth of bitcoin and initiate a short position. Bitcoin then turns around and Rises $500. They just lost their entire sum
Futures are different but a lot of people don't use those because they require more money to open an account. The future is follow the price action of the underlying coin.

Not at all and I will explain why. The total number of Bitcoins that can be mined is 21 million. Think about if the Earth had 21 million pounds of gold. Some of that gold is melted down and alloyed with other materials. Some of it is lost at sea never to be recovered. Gold however still has value even though as the years go on there is less of it every year. Bitcoin works exactly the same way. For each coin that is lost and each person that forgot where they put their key when they went to Cold Storage it makes the value of the remaining coins that much higher. It's getting to be pretty difficult to own an entire Bitcoin and in two years it's going to be ridiculously hard or expensive. The next halving is going to happen and that means each block of Bitcoin is only going to be 6.25 coins. The value of Bitcoin either has to go substantially higher or the entire project has to crash. The reason I say it has to go higher is because of the cost of mining. It's getting more and more expensive to extract Bitcoin out of the air. I don't have the foggiest idea how high or where the price is headed but I would be very surprised if it's not at least 35 thousand by 2020 at a minimum

Completely agree. You have segwit on one hand and you have Litecoin on the other which serve different purposes so if it was about a technical perspective he had two really good choices that we're still true to the original nature of Bitcoin. It's just kind of amazing how much effort he's putting into trying to kill the project and pump himself up. The massive Network spam that did make Bitcoin fees go high a few months ago. The burn pile of bcash going on right now. I mean the only argument I can think of for owning bcash is that you just know this guy is eventually going to put his all in it even if it breaks him and pump that coin as high as he possibly can. I just wonder if he realizes that if he did that it's pretty obvious what would happen next.

Same. It's possible the article referencing the three-year-old threw up a high risk profile because three year olds don't purchase crypto

You so nailed it. I think he wants to be the face of crypto and the thought of being pushed Into history just terrifies him

It's that psychology. If people start doing the same thing for a period of time they have a hard time stopping.
We hit these extreme oversold levels and are basing off of very good support yet a ton of people are still listening to the idiot on YouTube saying BTC 3K. It's playing out absolutely textbook right now. The disbelief. That should continue for a few weeks. This whole Market is going to be bullish until August 10th. That's kind of the D-Day to figure out which way we are going to go from there on. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:59:35
I think it's just a psychology cycle. Young people especially have the attention span of an ant. They get really hyped up for awhile and when that busts it's like a light switch being turned off. A few months later the whole process can reset
Couple that with the ever-present fear of " is there really a future to all this" and the entire Market starts making a lot more sense. It's really no surprise that Bitcoin has been around for 9 years and you only have a handful of millionaires. The majority of people sell either underwater or the second they get a small gain it seems like.

There is still no fee as long as you keep at least $1,500 between your accounts at all times. Throw a couple thousand in savings and you have free checking

I think the plan B is already underway. They have a burn pile and they are going to tighten up supply so it will be very easy to pump. The last-ditch Hope might be if they inflate the price potentially even higher than Bitcoin they might get some attention. Personally I think if they do that people are just going to dump like a caterpillar dumptruck
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:50:46
Probably. The thing I have noticed though is Litecoin is exactly like Bitcoin around 2 years ago. In 400 and some days the halving will happen on Litecoin taking it down to 12.5 per brick. Litecoin is trading at roughly 25% of what Bitcoin did in 2015 which is exactly what you would want to see since it has 4X the Supply. If the trend continues that we have already had in place Litecoin should hit $5,000 around 2020. It's the original fork and only legitimate child of Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:19:42
This is exactly why I have always respected Charlie Lee. He was transparent about the project and never let his ego get in the way. The Litecoin project is in my opinion the only legitimate child of Bitcoin. One could even argue that his sale of the majority of his Litecoin Holdings runs true to the nature of the project because it reduces the centralization and reduces his influence over the coin. I bring this up because it is the most often shit talked aspect of his project.

Chances are her answer depends on the way the question is phrased. News outlets have a habit of snipping little pieces of comments. She could have said all of those things but you don't really know what they mean unless you see the full context.
@_date: 2018-04-20 07:01:53
Bitcoin is in its infancy right now. I mean it's been out for like 10 years practically but there is still quite a ways to go. It's also more likely to be a store of value and some of the altcoins will be what we use for transactions. No one really knows how many Bitcoins are going to be out there but it's probably going to be 15 to 17 million just guessing on that. A lot of them have already been lost which is why we will never see 21 million in circulation. They are testing the lightning Network right now and if they can get that to work on a large large scale it's really only a matter of time before you have Bitcoin debit cards and they directly take on Visa and MasterCard. When that happens it's probably going to cause a parabolic run and $20,000 will look cheap

Fud fud fud.......hype hype hype. Rinse and repeat 
Let's consider this about the news. They are extremely bullish about the stock market right now. Best week in years. We are going to have a soft Landing. The economy is growing great? You guys hear this stuff lately? Now let's look at some facts
Growth is slowing from great to good. That means we are having a deceleration at a time when price-to-earning ratios are at historic highs. What do you think is going to happen when you have slowing GDP and already lofty price ratios?
Do you see the news talking about that? In fact fed chairman Powell had a couple sentences referencing that exact situation in the FED minutes and not a single News Channel mentioned it. They cherry-picked all of the good stuff to feed the hype cycle
As the economy does slow and especially if we get into a recession down the road. Watch and see what the media does. You're going to approach a very good buy point and they are going to be telling people how terrible everything is. They are going to be talking about people getting laid off. They are going to be talking about stocks falling everyday . at that moment is when you should be backing up the truck and dumping money into Wall Street. When growth goes from terrible or negative to even remotely positive that is accelerating
What's going to happen with Bitcoin is eventually no amount of bad news is going to drive it any lower. That's when you should start really going to town accumulating it. If this plays out like 2015 we are going to go sideways until the back half of 2019 and probably Trace out a pretty good support and resistance level revisiting both more than once
Lastly there is an angle of psychology with all of the negative news. Think about this. People love watching train wrecks. The interest in Bitcoin is increasing day by day. People are thinking is it finally going to fail? Is it all over? They pay attention. They start to learn a little bit. Those are prime candidates for people to join the market if the price turns around. They will think oh it's going on a run again! That negative news is going to draw in more new people

Lot of people who were drawn to crypto have gambling mindsets. They don't have any real interest in studying development or taking an active role in the community. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:25:33
Historically you can see what happens to the price. Now let's discount the price. How will it stay profitable you might wonder if history does not repeat? The network will adjust difficulty. You will have more people dropping off and only the most efficient are going to stick around. It's already heading that way actually. Sha256 has to be on 7nm and solar or hydro. Even with the best power 16nm is best case break even right now
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:28:08
Well, if history repeats we are basically range-bound until the back half of 2019.

I definitely think sidechains are going to be in the future. The way I look at them is a lot like apps on Android or Windows. You have the core operating system which is the chain and on top of that you can build a variety of different things. We know how lightning network is going. What if someone wanted to directly challenge MasterCard? They start a business with a few employees and they offer chargeback protection and case resolution? They develop their sidechain and they set their fees accordingly. Pretty reasonable chance they can directly undercut MasterCard and you can have a Grassroots operation and develop a useful product. What about one that you can link to your bank account kind of like PayPal and you don't even have to buy Bitcoin. You can click a button and have a certain amount of Fiat withdrawn sent across lightning Network and then it purchases Whatever item you want. This also can be done at a lower cost than the current infrastructure. If you sit back and close your eyes and imagine how all of this can develop. The possibilities are pretty vast

If you're just a gambler I suppose I can see the point in that. A lot of us that have been around for more than a year get a little more involved with the project and where they are going.
Bch is marketed very dishonestly. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:05:47
No one actually knows. Conventional media is trying to convince people that a recession if we do get one is not going to be till the end of 2020 which means it's probably going to be sometime late 2019. 
Historically the people who have done the best with Bitcoin have been people who just get their hands on some and forget about it. Get involved with the development and get involved with actually using it
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:02:48
It's a bit more of a fraud. A lot of us would not have a problem with Bitcoin cash if they marketed it independently. They were not hostile. Basically behaved like decent people. What we have is them using a subreddit with the btc ticker. Roger using bitcoin.com to push his own creation. All kinds of narrative trying to convince people their Fork is the actual Bitcoin. It's all very very dishonest. That's the real problem.
There is really no one else or no other coin in cryptocurrency I can think of that is attempting a hostile takeover of Bitcoin. The really sad part about all of the people behind it is they have been trying this for over a year and they keep slipping month by month.

The better question is why did no one tell you to buy in 2014 and 2015 when it was on CNBC? The answer is the same as today. Lot of media keeps putting Bitcoin down and painting it as a potential fraud. Eventually those of us who find our way here see through that and realize what it actually is. That's also why you are going to continue to grow the user base year after year

Are some of you guys saying this is terrible reading the chart correctly? Just curious when he says a percentage confidence it means he's confident it will stay Within that particular price range. The 90% confidence is the most likely scenario but when you drop down to something like 99% it's basically like short of Jesus coming out of the sky type situation it will be within this range
