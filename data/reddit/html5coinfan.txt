hats of to this self made man
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:28:08
It’s HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:05:46
Bs , how can you ever prove this
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:47:28
Meaning after both Blockchain’s are functioning for at least 2-3 weeks
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:24:33
And also incidentally the budget of an average American family for Black Friday 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:21:18
Yes genius . You must Einstein’s grandmother 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:48:21
Good plan . That’s what most of the folks did for bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:17:14
Don’t use bitcoin to wash your dirty laundry in public 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:34:06
Yes , you will be able to retire at 18
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:49:27
Relax .. just joking
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:43:55
Hind sight is always 20-20 . Don’t bash the poor soul. 
Why OP if you were so smart why didn’t you grab bitcoins worth 10$ at 3 cents a piece and retire now in 2017 
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:41:15
Thanks , you are awesome
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:49:34
You are right , I probably overreacted , not the best choice of words on my part in trying to make my point , that people just didn’t know that bitcoin will be such a big hit in 2009 or even in 2011  and who can blame them . ., my apologies.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:21
Ha ha these guys at bitcoincash are the biggest scammers and they somehow pumped bch to 800
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:54:29
Looks same as the bitmain miner . Just with a different name painted in the box
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:45:03
Ha ha , couldn’t stop laughing towards the end 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:08
Hodl

I take a gambling casino attitude . Walk in to a casino with expectations of losing all the money
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:43:41
I say , please do . I want to buy more of them 3000$ bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:29
Amen to that
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:06:10
This weekend it's going to for sure
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:06:50
Notice how all the banks and institutions are singing bitcoin songs now that it's rising . 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:04:48
Definitely a bubble for the % of people who are invested in bitcoin.  I would say about .00001 % own this and the price is this , hence it's a bubble . But say we are in an exclusive group eh
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:16:10
Definitely hold it . Or like we say hodl. What's the worst that can happen . Right now the price is 5700$ .  I don't see it even dipping to 4000 . If it ever came to pass that it became 4K . There will be a feeding frenzy for those coins . 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:18:30
Great idea mate
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:16:44
Cranky . You need to catch some sleep.
Your bulb is not glowing
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:21:16
Just messing with you bro. Why exactly do you feel that we should sell the bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:15:59
But it's theoretically possible then 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:56:19
USA banning bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:52:46
For those of you who wanted to buy the dip. Here it is 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:45:08
This is all bitcoin users dancing now.  Don't know don't care who the dancer is 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:51:32
why its not far fetched
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:07:35
Only buy from cb or some approved exchange . Don't hand random people your money . U could be accused of funding something 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:25:49
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:04:46
Currency is an asset but assets are not necessarily currencies . Hope that clears it up
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:54:07
Ok . I like to add k to my scentencesk
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:33:59
Does it impact bitcoin public and private keys
Can someone compute the private keys based on public keys
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:24:57
 Million dollars and expect the returns back in 5 years 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:26:57
You should invest according to your risk tolerance level .  How did h come up with that 10% number . I am sure there was a great deal of analysis he put into it .... once he bought btc for millions 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:47:17
increasing 100$ every minute
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:54:36
Does adding a password , change the seed words 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:54:56
me at 5500
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:48:45
Looks like your handwriting to me
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:14:56
Amen bro
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:46
Ether could , its more fluid
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:50:24
everyone, hold your sitting, standing positions, dont move a muscle.
we dont want to spoil the luck
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:19:41
Awesome and very responsible . Way to go 
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:06:36
I would say 7trillion market cap before the crash starts
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:53:24
once it reached 5000, its just unstoppable
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:49:30
There should be a way for common people to vote on important bitcoin decisions. I know by running a full node .
Uphold the network , be a responsible bitcoiner 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:58:56
Even your regular lite wallet will work. When importing seed make sure you create a new wallet
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:38:26
I would say in the next 2 years
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:25:13
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:25:32
What do you mean . If you are asking the max bcc . Yes it’s 21 million
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:07:28
Even ether makes me go like that
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:31:40
also consider the btc coins lost
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:46:06
It's never late , till it hits 1mil is a good time 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:32:33
can it mine bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:00:44
Best not to give any numeric predictions like quadruple, triple etc. think what he will feel like if his investment were to tank . No one knows the future 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:33:01
Also found be to keep the price stable at that point . It could be preventing the price rise 
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:23:02
Cool thanks for clarifying 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:53:25
Which should set you back by 5k per sale
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:01:04
This is all bitcoin users dancing now.  Don't know who the dancer is 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:19:53
Will the computation take long time , every single time or is it random . Can someone get lucky is it randomized 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:54:11
no worries, 10000k soon
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:32:34
Does gdax allow automated order submission
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:19:57
About 1 satoshi , and the next year after that .001satosis
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:29:36
