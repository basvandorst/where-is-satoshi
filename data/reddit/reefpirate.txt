Tax evasion is a different matter... But the Drug War gets no sympathy from me. Complete miserable failure from start to end, with all the big drug dealers getting rich in USD.
And again, how is tax evasion all of a sudden a big problem with Bitcoins? How many billions of dollars is evaded with USD each year?
Basically my point is that the argument that BTC is unregulated and prone to attracting terrorists and criminals is a complete non-argument considering that to date all of the billions of dollars in tax evasion, prostitution and drug trading has all happened under the USD regime. What kind of example is that??

Why would you take a 'serious investor' to the subreddit front page... And why would you expect some sort of valuable intelligent material to be there?
And what's so bad about this post? In non-bitcoin spaces I've often run into the stupid criticism that bitcoin is just for people to launder drug and prostitution money... As if that isn't already happening in larger volumes in USD.

This seems to be confusing the argument a bit. Presumably the regulatory infrastructure isn't going to be 'replaced' by anything. Unless you're on the an-cap end of the spectrum, courts are used to enforce contracts and that's the end of it. 
MtGox took all your money? You should be able to sue for it back or possibly get someone on fraud or theft charges which would be completely consistent with my understanding of libertarian thought.
I don't mean to get confrontational here, but what sort of regulations do you imagine would help save people from this MtGox disaster? I'm legit curious. I imagine your answer would be that MtGox would have to get a license or something from a government bureau ahead of time. There would be some extra hoops to jump through that a few lawyers could manage, but ultimately people would still have all of their money on an exchange that closes due to poor management (or whatever people are speculating about this). So you'd have a state-managed insurance fund to cover everyone's losses?

I wouldn't call it unexpected, but that doesn't change the fact that they don't really need to know about it.
Despite all of these safe guards it hasn't stopped HSBC from laundering shit loads of drug money, and it hasn't done much of anything to slow down the drug trade which continues to do most of its business in USD.

For someone who doesn't believe in moral objectivity you sure put up a good fight. Most true relativists will capitulate early on by saying 'what's right for you is right for you'.

Indeed, they are always difficult fringe cases. I'd argue they're certainly not without their problems and also not modeled very well after the Marxist idea of socialism.

I would agree something like Hockey or Football is more physically demanding in general, but definitely in SC2 there is plenty of physical activity that would classify it above 'zero'.

Basically all the same arguments that come up about Gold not being a 'real currency' also apply to BitCoin. The arguments aren't identical, but they are pretty similar. Most schools of economics these days seem to have completely given up on gold while others, like the Austrians at Mises, still claim a finite supply is superior but less convenient for the powers that be.

I think when North Korea punishes tax evaders it is a very unpleasant and inhumane punishment, and that alone should make it morally reprehensible to you.
If you are able to make a moral judgement about the North Korean government being illegitimate, isn't it a bit hypocritical to then say that people who refuse to pay taxes to the North Korean regime should be subject to North Korean punishments?
Basically it seems to me that you're simultaneously defending the rights of a despotic regime to enforce its laws while rejecting the legitimacy of its claims to do so. So which is it?
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:20:38
He obviously pals around with Austrians, but he makes it fairly explicit at the start of the lecture that he has plenty of disagreements with the Austrian school. I just thought I should point that out in case some people are Austrian-phobic.
I thought it was a really cool history lesson on other cases where private actors took it upon themselves to create currency and how it worked. It reminded me a lot about what Bitcoin seems to be going through at the moment.
Through the perspective of this brief history I think you could easily understand how other players will inevitably get involved in the market for new 'digital' coins beyond Bitcoins, and basically this may be just the beginning of a wild ride of new digital currencies.

Surely you also need to temper this with the fact that states have also been responsible for delivering the most misery to the most people in the process.
I happen to agree with you that the state has served to deliver stability, but until very recently that has always come at the cost of large amounts of suffering. On top of the lack of property rights, freedom of movement, freedom of expression, the state has also fought wars and participated in genocide since time immemorial.

CAVirtEx is your best bet... It's a bit tricky to put CAD in to VirtEx but it's easier to get it out with direct deposit. So deposit your BTC on their exchange and arrange a withdrawal in CAD.
They also are soon to launch their BTC debit cards that don't require a bank account and a simple/easy verification process. You can then load up your debit card with BTC/CAD and withdraw cash at almost any ATM.

Schiff has done a lot of talks at the Mises Institute and I always figured he was kind of an unofficial member. His outlook on economics is certainly of an Austrian variety, don't you think?

This is how Schiff and a lot of the Austrians usually talk about gold (and now some of them talk about Bit Coins too, actually). It's not that Gold was shooting up in value in some sort of speculative bubble as much as everything else valued in dollars was going down.
As usual, this shit is complicated and I don't really know what to make of it, but I also tend to think that Bitcoin is rising in relative value as much if not more than everything else is being devalued in dollars.

I'm a little curious how well this system will scale with volume of transactions over time. 
If we assume that in 20 years this system will be a mass market with a shit-quintillion of transactions in the blockchain and transaction lists, will it take 40 years for a new node to download all that information? Won't there be problems with the system slowing down and possibly becoming less viable under its own weight?
I'm also a bit curious what happens once the last bitcoin has been mined. How does the digital signature system still work if there aren't miners out there solving the math problems?

I think the problem or main disagreement in this discussion is between you who seems to think that justice is a relative or subjective concept and then the rest of us who see justice as an absolute objective thing.
Certainly property rights is an abstraction just the same as the social contract is an abstraction... But for a lot of folks around here, including me, property rights is something that can be reasonably determined to be just whereas the social contract is something more difficult to get behind due to its complexity and amorphous properties.
The concept of a social contract is very fluid and has to be renegotiated on a near constant basis. Different states have different contracts, it gets violated nearly constantly by both parties, and it often puts one in the uncomfortable position of defending what are blatant atrocities on the part of the state (ie. trying to defend the North Korean tax collector).
Theft and murder are much simpler moral problems to solve than some sort of moving target like the violation of an unspoken and unwritten social contract. And too often the state gets to set the terms of negotiation when really they should be giving up a lot more than they do.

Talking about it in fearful terms like this is a bit disturbing. If it's such a threat then it's good for consumers. Bitcoin can and should be able to stand on its own in a competitive marketplace.
