I'm a bit out of it, but do you have a guide on how to set something like this up? I would love to contribute. How much money are you making? If really hope it's small, as I'd rather the network and users win out, though I realise infrastructure costs money to run.

I haven't been on this subreddit since earlier this year. Are major exchanges using segwit and batching transactions? The next time there a crypto craze we'll need quick transactions to exchanges.

A software wallet is fine if you follow the instructions and know how to use it back to front.. I'd only go Trezor once you're at $10k+

Thanks man but you can keep the satoshis, I have a lot more and these can go to help somebody else.

The wallets are safe. You just need to know how to use them. Whatever wallet you go with spend a few hours testing it. Back it up, wipe it, restore it etc. Finally set up a new wallet, backup the seed securely, then fill 'er up.

I haven't paid much attention lately but has segwit adoption high? I suppose lightning is still in early testing stages too right.

I use to get stressed out about price and honestly, selling a portion and not reading about BTC has put me at ease. Every now and then I'll come by this subreddit, sort by popular for the month and see how lightning is doing, and rootstock, and the other thing that'll allow easy access to switching currencies quickly.
Those are the things that'll make BTC great and will really launch us forward. The central bank in Australia recently put out a report that a eAUD style electronic coin will not exist in Australia any time soon, because the banks new payment platform (NPP) and SWIFT will make electronic transfers faster. They dun get it, either do other people.
We have a long way to go.

Can someone please tell me why it's been increasing for the last 6 months? I've been outta the game a while.

I haven't paid attention to BTC in a while (and find it less stressful to pay attention to the daily news). Can someone point me in the right direction of why the price has gone up? Lightning network, new technologies, anything substantial?
