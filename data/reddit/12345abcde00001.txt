Amidst a global stock market flash crash, a spectacular sell-off continues in cryptocurrencies at an acceleration quicker than anticipated!
Rather surprisingly, the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level from the all-time highs, and nearby zones of clustered support levels (derived from wave extension relationships); have all failed to provide any meaningful areas of confluence.
And so therefore, the next natural support zone is at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level from the all-time highs; i.e. at $4257 (Bitfinex).
In regards to the anatomy of wave formation, a rare Triple Zig-Zag structure may be in progress to conclude the final stages of the first crash wave.

Should the Elliott Wave projection continue as anticipated, then there is a strong possibility that the high of 9990 (Bitfinex) set on 12-MAR-2018 is of quite significance in the following regard: 
i. 9990 is just 46 points shy from 9946 which represents the 50% Fibonnaci retracement of the entire Bitcoin market. Either side of this key level currently defines 'bull vs bear' territory.
ii. Should 9990 present the top of a significant wave, it would suggest Bitcoin will now never revisit the psychological 10,000 level.

@_date: 2018-02-13 22:02:24
After rallying 55% from the 6000 (Bitfinex) lows in just 4 days, the market has been drifting sideways for 4 days.
The sideways wander could either suggest that the first leg of the rally is complete, and a retracement is currently underway. Or, the market is consolidating in preparation to breakout and resume the move higher.
Taking out 8950 (Coinbase) and 9000 (Bitfinex) to the upside would confirm the rally is resuming.
However for now, weakening price action appears to be favoring a retracement. A typical retracement ought to be around 50% which is at 7482 (Coinbase) and 7538 (Bitfinex).
At 7599 (Bitfinex), represents 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire Bitcoin market.
Given the aforementioned criteria, the following short position has been ordered:
BTC/USD (COINBASE)
OPEN: 8600
CLOSE: 7482
STOP: 8950
RISK: 4%
REWARD: 13%
Afterwards, the expectation would be for the market to resume the Primary degree b-wave bounce, which may retrace up to 38.2% of the Primary a-wave decline which began on 06-JAN-2018.
The following Fibonacci levels may serve as target areas of where the rally may conclude towards the psychological 10000 level, Bitfinex prices:
1. 9350: approx previous line of support/resistance.
2. 9946: 50% Fibonacci retracement level of entire Bitcoin market.
3. 10298: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the decline which began on 06-JAN-2018

**Real-time analysis of the 2018 Crypto Crash — PART 4**
Bitcoin has taken out the 11250 (Bitfinex) high; and hence, the stop-loss on the short position has been triggered at a 7% loss.
Fibonacci resistance clusters, zone 1:
 38.2% retracement of the downtrend from 17-DEC-2017
 50% retracement of the downtrend from 06-JAN-2018
 The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.236 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-11652).
* Average*
Fibonacci resistance clusters, zone 2:
 The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.382 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-12100).
 38.2% retracement of entire Bitcoin market.
 The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.5 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-12463).
* Average*
At time of writing, taking out the low of 10900 would suggest the rally losing momentum. The low of 10122 is the current key level between the bulls &amp; bears.
RSI divergence against price action on the 4-hr may suggest a forthcoming trend-reversal.
Taking out the low of 10900 (Bitfinex/Coinbase) would suggest the rally is losing momentum.
The low of 10308 (Bitfinex) and 10279 (Coinbase) is the current key level between the bulls &amp; bears.
**2018 Cryptocurrency Crash (Elliott Wave): Bear Market Resumes?**
Crosspost: 
Bitcoin has rallied 100% from the 6000 (Bifinex) lows set on 06-FEB-2018.
A completed wave structure at 10271 was the first attempt at calling the top of a bear market rally, which failed. A subdivision of the wave structure took the market to 11250 which was the second failed attempt at calling the top. 
Attempt  
Attempt   
Since failure of calling the top at two previous junctures, Fibonacci resistance zones have been calculated as follows:
Fibonacci resistance clusters, zone 1:
     38.2% retracement of the downtrend from 17-DEC-2017
     50% retracement of the downtrend from 06-JAN-2018
     The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.236 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-11652).
     Average
Fibonacci resistance clusters, zone 2:
     The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.382 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-12100).
     38.2% retracement of entire Bitcoin market.
     The first leg of the rally (i.e. 6000-9075) times 1.5 in length, would equal the second leg of the rally (i.e. 7851-12463).
     Average
Cumulative average: 11907 (Bitfinex).
As of 20-FEB-2018, the market appears to have completed a Triple Zig-Zag formation from 7851 to 11788, which is just a mere 119 points shy of the 11907 cumulative average of the aforementioned Fibonacci resistance zones.
In addition, weakening internals of an overbought RSI has been creating negative divergences against rising price action on the 4-hr.
Compounded with largest drop since the rally began on 06-FEB-2018, and trend-reversals occurring in popular Altcoins; there is reason once more to suggest the bear market rally has completed, and the second leg of the bear market may be underway.
It is always a precarious pursuit in attempting to call major market turns; nevertheless, third time lucky?!
Short position activated overnight (UTC midnight) at 10900, with an initial target of 4257 which represents a 78.6% Fibonacci decline of the entire Bitcoin market:
    BTC/USD (BITFINEX)
    OPEN: 10900
    CLOSE: 4257 (&amp; open-ended)
    STOP: 11788
    RISK: 8.15%
    REWARD: 60%
A more conservative trade would be to await until the market takes out the low of 10308 (Bitfinex) and 10279 (Coinbase) which is the current key level between the bulls &amp; bears. And then, short positions can be initiated on bounces with a stop at 11788 (Bitfinex) and 11775 (Coinbase).

Time for a bounce? (Revised): 
Since bouncing from exactly 6000 (Bitfinex), the market has staged a 30% rally from the lows.
This is thus far the largest rally since the downtrend sell-off leg that started on 20-JAN-2018.
There were two bounces within the downtrend that began on 20-JAN-2018; i.e. as follows:
1.23-JAN-2018 to 28-JAN-2018: 22% bounce
2.02-FEB-2018 to 03-FEB-2018: 19% bounce
Given the current bounce from the 6000 lows has now exceeded the average 20% bounce size, it may suggest that the downtrend which began on 20-JAN-2018 is now complete; and by extension, it may suggest a completed wave structure which has ended the first leg of the crash.
The expectation would be a Primary degree b-wave bounce which may retrace up to 38.2% of the Primary a-wave decline which began on 06-JAN-2018.
However, there are previous levels of support which may serve as resistance as follows:
1.9350: approx previous line of support/resistance.
2.9946: 50% Fibonacci retracement level of entire market.
3.10298: 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the decline which began on 06-JAN-2018
Any one of the aforementioned levels may serve as targets for the bounce, with the average being 9865.
However, exuberance may propel towards the psychological 10000 given the proximity.
Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior, Robert Prechter:
"b-waves — b-waves are phonies. They are sucker plays, bull traps, speculators' paradise, orgies of oddlotter mentality or expressions of dumb institutional complacency (or both). They often involve a focus on a narrow list of stocks, are often 'unconfirmed' by other averages, are rarely technically strong, and are virtually always doomed to complete retracement by c-wave. If the analyst can easily say to himself, 'there is something wrong with this market', chances are it's a b-wave."

Feel compelled to post because:
1. Reddit is evidently a 'hodl' community and is blind to one side of the market —a dangerous ambition.
2. The posts despite accuracy are being down-voted, buried and deleted; and thus being hidden from view and preventing speculator due diligence.
3. Posting at different time-zones provides a global reach. It would be most unfortunate for a speculator in a developing country to lose their savings simply because of mania.
