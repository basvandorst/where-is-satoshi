Just added 500 to gemini, if this drops back in the 10s gonna add
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:48:22
Quick newb question, is there a cost to move my BTC from gdax to my nano s? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:47:26
I really fail at hodl.. sold at 10400 and then bought back at 11500 because i'm an idiot. I'm done, time to walk away from the computer . My girlfriend says to me... why would you sell at 10400, if you didn't sell at 19400?  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:21:37
Profit / Loss
$ -1,142.88
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:12:33
I kind of feel the same as you do.I have 500 in right now, still a small player. i had 1800 in it , until i sold last night, it then ran up from 7295..Yesterdays 7000/7100  was under heavy volume and it didn't move. So i'll wait and see if it heads back down today.I am skeptical right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:19:52
been buying on the way down 500 at a time.. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:50:30
And here i am worrying about having bought at 7830 lol 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:24:53
Only down $180 now at least, come back to me 7800 heh  Terrible buy, good thing i am a low roller
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:07:09
That sucks, my Drivers license doesn't even match my home address.. I should probably do that, i just looked and i don't see any exceptions. However i swear i watched a youtube video where a guy was able to get away with it on a cop stop, by saying something about multiple residences 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:40:39
This might be a shocker...but losing money? lol 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:07
I think i am the only person who can lose at bitcoin investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:55:22
Bank reset was about 200$ too late :/   but likely will go back to 6500 again soon enough based on today's events 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:13
my 9800  my stop was filled wtf 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:57:19
Nice whale wall at 6099 asshole manipulation
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:50:17
I bought in at 7830. I am just waiting, i bought some today in the high 7100s to add to my position and bring my buy in # down.  If you are going to wait till it goes back to 7800 , you may as well buy more now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:53:29
can you sell more? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:34:38
I am waiting, dropped another 500 points overnight. i mean i'm down near $500 now. But, i was also up almost $500 4 days ago on a investment, i sold and bought more, unfortunately at a much higher rate. I guess the prudent thing would to buy more now. But, at the same time. I think that also can get you in trouble if it's not the bottom, which i experienced yesterday buying at 7200 
It doesn't help that i am stubborn.  I sat on snap forever and i should of sold it at 20 and took my losses. at least bitcoin has had good past experiences of rising. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:54:40
Unless you sold a few hundred grand.. i doubt we're mover or shakers~
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:48:50
lol just dropped $200 on it and already down $2 bucks.I really am not a masochist
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:11:42
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:05:10
Just went in another time at 6240  expect it sub 6k tonight 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:14:23
What's crazy is the sell order volume is so high at once, but buy orders steady. Need a big time player on buy side i guess.
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:54:36
sold my snap down 50% 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:41:16
There was someone who posted it would drop to 5700 or 5800 and then go back up, i wish i had followed him or her.They called it right. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:46
gemini still down
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:16
good to know, when shit hits the fan gemini closes down, ill be moving my shit off there.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:30:14
-23% 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:23:11
gemini 500 per day instant low fees
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:52:12
tonight seems like a good option, it was up to 7300 and now people taking some profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:56:22
I am hodling, but have to admit. When all other coins are going up.It's a little annoying to keep losing today
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:25:28
Nice run up, may be worth flipping to buy back again at the day traders sell tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:50:05
so did i, almost 3k worth : / 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:08:43
I hope she's smoking it.. Marry her if so. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:01:19
Interesting, could explain the current run up from 7100 
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:55:45
Somewhere along the lines, i learned to trade improperly. It appears i'm buying high and itching to sell low, but hodling 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:23:34
SELL MORTIMER SELL
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:52:55
Possibly, i took profits at 72 and 74. I'm out for now, this was just 6900 2 days ago, and it was just 7600 like 3 days ago. I'll wait for the pullback and be out of the game for a few days, and either regret the $50-100 profit i lost, or get back in when i feel more comfortable. I'm less than a .3 trader/investor though.So of course $10-20 either way matters to me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:59:27
Do any of these walls ever get hammered by HUGE instant buys or sells?  I mean i am sure it's happened, but we could use a big buyer now!
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:37:35
let's get into the 8s before then lol 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:02:19
hopefully 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:56:25
Jeeez low roller and my portfolio went from down 1200 to down 800 in a matter of 45 mins. gotta love that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:21:03
That was a huge buy, was it a tether? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:20:52
Signed up for gemini, got approved within a few hours after sending an email... Nice that i can instantly add cash.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:09:12
Still up $140 on my buys over the last 2 weeks, i go long.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:27:06
LARPING conspiracy isn't just 4chan now i see
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:16
I'm already down $1100 and BTC itself is down 2200 from my buy in. I have bought a little on the way down. The way i make myself feel better, there is probably others who are down much more than i am.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:41:26
Need to get past this 6300
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:54:14
After the bank wire fee usually $25 and then $10 gdax fee. that's probably more on a $500 deposit than coinbase charges i think. unless i am wrong . Yes, im not a gambler, so i am not adding tens of thousands into bitcoin. I am shocked i am at 2k now 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:59:01
I sold off at 7169 and then panic bought before bed at 7172 because i was afraid it would go up this morning while i slept. Now it's struggling for 7100 all day. I guess worst case scenario my profits i reinvested 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:25:45
I just keep buying, i bought at 72 and bought more at 69, probably too high on those, but if it bounces. Maybe i'll take some profits
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:19:17
Still time to lock in some low prices, maybe not 5200 or w/e it was. But, if you have faith in BTC, may as well get in now if you can afford it. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:49:03
Have come so far... i was down 1.5 grand.. now just $100 i should of bought more in the 6's than i did on the way back. i was scared :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:59:51
yeah the wall i see it.
Likely manipulation, they are buying now, and then will break the wall and price will go up above 6100 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:10:03
Anyone want to see my 4k tv? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:06:57
I think the only option is to like add 3 grand or something to gdax, but you know when you're starting out, you're hesistant on dropping big cash.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:03:31
Well that $5 probably would only be worth $2 now 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:19:22
i read this... i just keep my .3 on gdax... and .3 on gemini. is that a bad idea? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:36:55
same. But, i should of bought in the 5's. But, i couldn't get money in gemini. i did use CC for some at 6100 over the weekend
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:43
Gemini wouldn't let me add any, or i would of just bought more, used my last $77 in balance on gdax to get 0.01  
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:45:11
Knew i should of sold on sunday, and bought again today. Damn it! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:02:23
Just need a paddock comped picture added to that, he'd fit right in /Those guys ooze slimey and i know nothing about them 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:03:44
I tried to add 500 to gemini, but it said per business day and not "Day" limit meh 
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:34:00
Yes, down $700 right now. Thank god i'm not a crazy crazy gambler. I am stubborn, hopefully that doesn't cost me in the end.. I stuck with SNAP forever and finally just cut my losses.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:53:53
I think we hit our lows for the last few hours, who knows what later holds. But, i think the support now in the buys look good in this area
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:50:54
I thought the same at 6700 and now look at it.. Can't even regain 6500 . Look at the volume. No huge buys :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:55:32
7888 for me... on gemini  and 7830 on gdax
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:10:31
I'm afraid to even google that word. Not that i have anything to hide. but heh 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:26:51
it went to 5200
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:59:39
yes BCH dropped like 50% during that exact same period before btc reacted 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:11
annoyed at coinbase long deposit time, if you debit my bank, it should be there the next day, just like paypal. 
I shouldn't of went in at 7200,. at least only 500$  
Wish there was an easier way to pay with bank, and not pay such high fees + $40 in btc increase coinbase does.I prefer not to add money before trading. So while i occasionally add $500 to gdax, i kinda like the convenience of just paying through coinbase with my bank
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:32:42
yep 6200 this morning 6300 now
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:53:02
You really lost 1.2 million dollars?  
@_date: 2017-11-08 06:24:31
Price will come down in the morning when they sell off, i got out before the 7300, which was bad for now. I think i can rebuy tomorrow in the 72s though
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:39:54
i thought the same and went in at 78, and now i'm down, anyone else?   but seconds later i could be up. who the hell knows 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:18:45
I have perfected it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:35:46
Not seeing a lot of buyer backed support, last night when it got near 5k there was huge 200+ buy walls. i do see a nice 6000 wall though 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:54:32
yep. that's why i was buying in the 69's . It's gambling at this point. I've been trying to get a feel for it. To me, it seems like mondays sell off from the weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:42:23
I really hope so..I put in near 4grand at 7800+ and about 2k on the way down now... now it's about to hit 5k's . I would of been smart to sell at 6700 and then rebought now..But of course every time you think to yourself... this has to be bottom, but nope new lows 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:00:33
If SNAP didn't burn me, i probably would feel more at ease, but at least BTC has experiences going down and up. Luckily in both cases, my investment wasn't all that much. I am hopeful i don't lose 50% like SNAP.  I only like 350 on SNAP, opposed to in the 500s currently on btc 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:13:27
not really mad, i don't really understand how it works. its all good. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:35:42
There's just no buy support
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:01:57
So many BCH shills on here today. Makes you wonder 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:14:38
went from down 1500 to up 250 and still a few holdings i am waiting to get back..life of buying at 7.8k last week
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:40:06
use gemini..500 instant and resets 5pm every day
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:10:56
People can say.... remember when it was... and it went to ....  the fact is, if you're sitting here and watching this and even have .5 btc into it at near ATH like some of us do. It's still disconcerning to see you're -$800   That means for you to break even, it has to go up nearly 15% or more. It's still frustrating. I think 6200 is the resistance level, but who knows. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:04:32
How hard is it to switch it to an exchange to sell? I guess if I am in it for the long HODL that’s the way to go   . I’ll look into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:22
sold at 9800 stop loss limit... and just bought back at 9800...  hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:34:11
I wish i could find the guy who posted it, i didn't think it would keep dropping but it did, and he gave a technical analysis on why. Wasn't just me waking up and looking and saying, i think it'll drop today/ 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:14:56
There goes all my fingerlings profits. in 36 hours
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:15:42
i bought at 7880 on gemini heh 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:03:26
Almost getting back to even on SOME buys... long road since down 1.5k saturday, a few greens from my 6100 purchases, but my 7800 still ways off
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:38:24
7845 &gt;&lt;  and then seconds later it drops $200 w/e 
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:39:56
Make a twitter list to follow? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:47:42
Remember, those who aren't making on BCH when the correction comes, and it will. They'll flock back to Bitcoin and it'll all repeat itself.  At least that's what i tell myself
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:52
same. i sold at 9800.. which i was pissed. tried to buy it back and gdax crashed. Now i'm waiting to put my 3.3k back in. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:44:10
At so in like 30 mins, does btc jump? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:12:51
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:45:19
God i hope so. even though it's just down $500 right now for me... it's still hard to swallow.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:55:52
Should i leave my BTC in gdax or transfer it over to coinbase for the fork?    How is gemini handling the fork?  
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:23:36
yep. i got sucked in that buy block and locked in at a rate it'll be awhile to get back to. Debating setting a limit sell order to cut my losses if it goes back down to 7000
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:17:28
Nice jump for those of you in the game. Hope it sticks :)  7650 almost 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:33:13
I wonder if this is the bounce, or will we see it deteriorate over the weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:08:41
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:40:08
Here we go again
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:48:41
will check it out. thx
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:59:15
I think it'll hover 5800-6200 for next hours in low volume times.. compared to others . But what do i know, i don't know how to read the order books, so don't take my advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:14:36
So price has been very set 6500 for like 24 hours... right? give or take 200-300$   isn't it usually much more volatile? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:49:32
Fuckface is a better imo.  Thoughts?

@_date: 2017-11-11 19:12:38
come on keep bouncing!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:08:05
UP UP UP UP
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:41:34
Seems like 6500 has been point of resistance... hope it doesn't break through
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:12:46
i bought in earlier today at 6200 additional and also 6700 day before.  I don't think i have a gemini 500 to add right now. But, i am just happy not down a grand again 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:09:49
It was fake.  You send .1 to 5 and receive xxx amount back. i know i know..now that i think about it. Just retarded. Live and learn. Not sure wtf i was thinking. why would i have to send anything to begin with. ahhhh 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:44:37
I knew something was up after i sent the transaction. I usually am not one who just makes rash decisions. I am calculated. But, i was worried i wouldn't get my chance. So i even increased what i sent from the .25 original. Which is exactly where i should of left it. There was a lot of factors after looking back and thinking about it now, were red flags. There was no need to send more than the minimum, the return amount was random, so why send more? I'm not above calling out idiocy, and what i did was idiotic. Well, all can enjoy making fun of me, i suppose it will only help me make better decisions and be even more skeptical going forward, i don't take offense to it, i was an idiot. Unfortunately even on gemini, i couldn't cancel it right away, which was annoying, i tried.
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:47:37
When i say i'll forget, what i mean is i won't dwell on it. Life goes on.   TRUST ME. I'll remember this, i could of put the god damned firebowl on my infinity pool corner that's been empty for 2 years now because i've been too cheap to buy the firebowl, paid 3 grand to run the gas like 40 feet and then never installed the bowl. Another regretful decision, well so was the pool but that's another story. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:26:48
exactly. Things like this, only motivate me to make more money. So that's what i'll now do. Hopefully will forget about it in a few days. heh 
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:50:10
thank you
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:43:35
I agree, i was an idiot. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:05:07
I don't browse here often, and only came today to tell my story... and i too was hit. at least yours was only 0.1 i sent nearly 2.2k worth.
Fucking idiots i are. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:37:06
Thanks. I know. I was dumb. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:57:47
To answer your question. I could see it happening, i could see the need to send the minimum, 25 cents. That's where i got greedy and it cost me. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 08:14:24
I think we are all humbled at some point. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 07:58:55
Got me tonight, man i feel like a moron. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:21:58
I hear ya, that 2600 has been in there for a year, haven't touched it. still have 400$ maybe my bad luck, will turn that into more if btc rebound some day.   I want to whine about it, but i messed up, but i figured posting the website, will allow others not to be scammed, because they can see how the scam is done. I cannot believe twitter let it the account be verified, must of been hacked, it was very elaborate, they had real looking bot accounts posting messages to replies etc..  I am probably only one who lost their shirt though heh 
@_date: 2018-11-09 18:10:32
I had about 2600$ usd in gemini, so that's the bulk of my loss, i think i have 4k in gdx, i do have a hardware wallet but never activated it, i guess i figured coinbase was safe enough. Maybe i'll think about removing it and just keep it locally. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 06:35:44
Yeah. That's exactly it.
