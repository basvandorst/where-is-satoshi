sorry to revive such an old post. I've been doing a lot of reading on bitcoins lately but want to play it safe with taxes.
From your post, does this mean that when I transfer money from my wallet to my bank account it is not taxable? Or is it taxable as straight income at whatever the exchange rate is at the time of transfer?
I've looked into the coinbase shift card and having to keep track of my spending at the current rates at each time of purchase seems insane.

As far as record keeping goes, that would be 2 transactions. Fiat for Eth and Eth for Alt. Cointracking.info keeps track of realized/unrealized gains as you have to input a time for every transaction and the different tax percentages, long or short. You can generate a tax report and that's what I intend to do at the end of the year. Fingers crossed it's good enough for the new US law.

Up to 200 transactions are free. I hold mostly and input transactions manually so it's not really a problem for me but I can see it being a pain in the ass if you're a trader.

Also, the notices were back in January and was pretty widely spread, especially in these forums.

With all due respect, use common sense and take a minute to think about the situation...
