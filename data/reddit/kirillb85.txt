Why sell? Get taxed to hell on it. Use it for future purchases.

I work in the customer service industry for a care chemical supplier. These e-mails hit close to home with me because I see them too often. An orders hits all pockets of issues, delays with raw material, delays in the warehouse, and seeing the custom's block gave me shivers(one of the most powerless times in an order).
I was almost with Jordan until halfway through where there was absolutely lack of any genuine concern or desire to solve the problem, keep the customer, lose some of the profit to keep value in the brand name.

People making predictions like this is the reason I'm in the negatives right now.

Congratulations. 
At least you didn't buy it at $800 like this ^ guy...

What are you trying to convince me. I know what the price was almost a year ago. Over twice of what it is today. That price ain't going up, I know everyone here likes to think it will. None of the good news has ever helped drive it up and I hate that anyone talking poorly about it gets buried.

Doesn't PNC cover all fees?

Who cares. It's at $500 right now. 
Maybe people were right, this is truly a bubble.
"stay with it" they said. what a joke.

This is it guys. This is it! The best kind of news we can ever get, mega stores accepting this currency.

I dunno about that. It hit 1200 and has been a steady decline.

I especially like the graph that points to bitcoin's exponential rise, and no comment about the exponential fall shown in the graph.

I bought in at $400 last year, it hit $1,200 and life was good. Everyone is screaming to the moon, buying Litecoins, predicting 12,000 in 2014. 
Speculation driving up price.

OP, have you figured out a fix? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:50:28
your nails enrage me.

Cats can't show feelings of enjoyment to their human overloads, unless human is upset about losing a roll of toilet paper.
