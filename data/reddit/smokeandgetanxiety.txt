I have a disability where I have severe diarrhea every half an hour, no job yet has wanted a worker that shits out his guts and goes on too many "breaks" 
Every job I've had has lasted 2 weeks at max. 
I've been trying to find an online job to no avail. The meds I take against it make me apathetic too unfortunately but help swelling.
What do you mean by "potential future"? Do you think one who owns 2.5 BTC is in for a ride? I can't imagine BTC going to 100k anytime soon. 
I thought the golden rule was you will "make it" with 10 BTC, because then you'll have a million in (unknown years).

I taught my dad TA, and that's how he did it, I didn't have the guts to put up my money but I helped him build his stack from 0.01, sure he earned it but I was there with him every night on tradingview, never asked for a bit.
Didn't mean to come off as a snob who hated his dad, then when he dies take over his mansion and is displeased with the decor. 
I do sound greedy. It's not on purpose, it's subconscious. It's a primal natural emotion that we try to suppress. 
I do not want to part with bitcoin, this digital gold. Not saying I need more. I'm saying it is unfortunate I have to trade it in for paper money with old people on them to continue existing, if that makes sense?

Is there a risk to buying 3 S9's and mining the most profitable coin of the day (like that site that chooses it for you and pays you out in BTC).
Predicting a 20% risk of entering a bear market for the next couple of years like last time BTC boomed and took the entire market with it, would the ~$2100 number change dramatically considering that happens? Say, down to 500$ or something if the market suddenly goes quiet. Would I then be left with 22k worth of mining equipment and mining coins in a bear market with $0.13 per kWh electricity costs? 
I kinda remember it happened last time. Sure, the internet was still young and now Bitcoin might be here to stay, but during that 2013 run-up all GPUs were sold out (as they are now), mining equipment was sold out, and then suddenly around January-March everything just screeched to a halt. 
I mean the people mining X coin still mined it and if they hodled until now then that was genius. However, it took 2-3 years for that mining to pay off. 
Am I incorrect? 
Consider these scenarios
BTC falls to 10k. How much $ would 3 S9's bring in monthly? 
BTC falls to 5k. How much $ would 3 S9's bring in monthly?
Is there a calculator for doomsday scenarios like this? Not to mention the possibility of an antminer being a lemon and having to send it in for warranty, etc. which would leave you with 2.
Thank you very much.

It's all on a paper wallet, secured. 
No forks to liquidate, tried sweeping all, I guess he did?
