lot of praise for fake money.
lo,l i kid, i'm one of those doesn't get it guys, but its fun to watch, and if it makes you all rich... fucking right dude. I probably woulda bought some if i knew about it when it was cheap, but I didn't, was too young. 
i just want one rocket ship ride to space. .. i'll still be here if you say no

@_date: 2019-07-18 14:56:04

i just hope people don't get greedy and then it crashes over night. 
Like if you got in when it was super cheap, you've won. It can go up higher and you've still won if you have sold your bitcoins now. 
I guess you'd have to weigh your wants against the prospect of massive regret.

 wait if you aren't going to sell it why did you buy it?
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:42:55
ooooh! ok that's really cool i remember now about people using it before to buy things. I think one of my brothers friend bought some ereally early and used his to buy a pizza or something (could be BS not sure ) and now he hates himself because he could have had like a million pizzas if he waited.

im not on either side, but if you think this is gonna silence critics.... lol you don't know critics.
here's my question, i'm not attacking anyone, honestly, you guys do you who cares. But i see a lot of 'don't sell' like nobody is ever going to sell. 
what's your number for when you sell? if you are planning to never sell them...... they are pretty much not worth a penny, which is fine, again, if you don't want to sell you don't have to, but if you aren't planning on selling why does the price of it matter

that is kind of neat i guess, to have like a score board. 
i think if i bought it low, then it got to like 20k or something i could not resist.
@_date: 2019-06-22 11:39:40
ok cool, that makes sense
