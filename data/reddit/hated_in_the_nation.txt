Didn't work. Thanks for trying. 
I've had this ID for less than a year and the front is more scuffed up than the back and it reads instantly (I mean *instantly*), but not the back. When I look at the back at a certain angle, I can see tiny scratches and scuffs, but I wouldn't think it's enough to make it not work.
This is ridiculous. The representative said that I always have the option of using the app to "sell" the bitcoins. Yeah, I'm going to sell the bitcoins back that I literally just bought, at a lower price (it has already fluctuated enough for me to lose a few dollars before fees) because your bullshit app can't fulfill the service that you advertise. 
My coins are basically stuck in their shit wallet.

I have previously bought Bitcoins at localbitcoins.com and had found it to be a very frustrating and not user-friendly. So this time, I decided to try to use a service that was touted as being very simple and quick using my debit card. 
And adding funds was very simple, and it would appear that transferring the coins to an external wallet should also be simple. It is just a bug in their app that is preventing it from recognizing the backside of my driver's license. 
If everything had worked as advertised, the process from start to finish would have been incredibly simple especially compared to localbitcoins.

Unfortunately, the issue isn't sending, I am unable to even get to that point yet. 
The problem I'm having is with the identity verification system. In order to enable the transfer option, I need to scan my ID and their app will not recognize the back of my license. I was told that this is a known bug, and that they have no alternative way of verifying my identity. 
So at this point I'm shit out of luck and I have Bitcoins sitting in a quasi "wallet" that cannot be used and the value of which is constantly fluctuating.
