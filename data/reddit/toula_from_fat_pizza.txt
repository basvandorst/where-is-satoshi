Yes, if anything it's actually worse to pay in BTC because you can't put that in your books as a loss. For unregistered businesses it might be harder to be detected by tax offices though, so long as you are making money in BTC or cash.

Doesn't Africa have enough problems without drugs?

It's not just windows man nor is it even just malware. I have installed apps that come with the linux distribution that have had vulnerabilities where i could get root.

You're probably going to run into the same problem speaking any language to dead people. Lucky for you though, [they're not dead!](

The rich and powerful won't be happy with the common man having that same power to avoid taxes. If they're not paying all their tax and we're not paying all our tax the government will not be happy. And obviously the wealthy few have a lot more influence over policy.

You should buy some drugs. BTC is awesome for that.

This is exactly what i and probably many others said was going to happen and we got shot down by so many idealists.  
Governments internationally will try to criminalise bitcoin as it obviously makes it very difficult to tax them and estimate who has how much money.  
There's a reason you are only allowed to carry X amount of cash leaving a country.

You're joking right? Either that or you must be spending a lot of time inspecting the source code of everything you install.

Why change the game? I like the game. It's a good game.

I don't know if this will do anything to stop DDOS attacks.  
  
[HOLY CRAP. nearly all nodejs http servers are vulnerable to DoS and apparently, the V8 guys seem to not care much](  
  
Plus, with the entire code base running on the one web server, i'm not sure what they would do if they *were* DDOSd.

From first glance that's just the source for a couple libraries not the whole LMAX exchange. Good luck.

I agree. I think if it gains more popularity some countries will ban it to prevent laundering and tax evasion.

They don't just use USD. They use south african rand also and something else from a neighbouring country but can't remember. I think they are better off doing this. Better to have a few diff currencies they are not responsible for than destroying their own again. I don't see how bitcoin would help compared to using the rand.

Node.js sounds like the hipster choice "omg node.js is sooo hawt rite now."  
I would go C++ at least for the core trading engine. You can always write the web interface part in something that wears skinny jeans and horn rimmed glasses.
