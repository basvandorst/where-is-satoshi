It's pretty much universally accepted by both sides that Jesus Christ is a real historical person who existed, died on the cross, was buried, and the tomb found empty.
No respectable historian denies this, either side. Can you imagine how much Richard Dawkins wants to say Jesus never existed and is pretend? Yet he concedes. 
People who say he probably didn't exist have not done their due diligence on the matter. 
Atheist historians will attest to this. 
Historically Jesus is like gold regarding validation of his existence. More than the most ancient people who we universally and almost unquestionably accept existed, like Julius Ceasar as an example. 
It's up to us individually to find out if he really is who he *said* he was.
And since he existed, it's not a matter that anyone should take lightly. 
A very apt quote from CS Lewis:

Yet he's sticking to his 250k by 2022 prediction right?
So I guess he considers that long term. Cool.

Orrr, he means exactly that, he doesn't think it's a complete delusion, like he once did.
What you infer from that statement is your own bias. You could say what he means is he thinks its still somewhat a delusion, but that is putting words in his mouth. 
Imagine if I said previously that it bitcoin is a complete delusion. 
Later, to detract that statement, I could say, "I don't think bitcoin is a complete delusion".
All it means is I take back what I said, I no longer believe that. 
His statements on the matter show that he believes it's not a delusion at all, if there is real legit use for it, whatever you belive that is.
Something that has a bright future, which is now his opinion, cannot be a delusion. Even partially.

It's funny because this is now so pessimistic about BTC.
