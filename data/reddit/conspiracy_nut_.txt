That's not what ad hominem means.

You have no idea what you're talking about. Microsoft has been roundly praised in almost every circle for their recent changes, including opening .NET, dropping support for legacy browsers and standards, building cross-platform tools, and embracing open source software like Linux. Microsoft has been doing things better than ever before.

You're confusing maybe making a bad decision with hasn't made many wise decisions. 
@_date: 2016-03-14 20:17:53
You left out the rest of the definition about how it only applies when making an argument. The op wasn't making an argument, just an insult. So it's not an ad hominem. It's an ad hominem if they said "you're wrong about Microsoft because you're a child". 
Just like appeal to popular opinion isn't a fallacy when talking about what the most popular restaurant is. 
It's not even an ad hominem to list a bunch of reasons why someone is wrong, and then add an insult to the end.

Are you under the impression that the reason for the delay is a technical one? Why do you think the use of a blockchain will eliminate KYC or AML regulations? 
It would _literally_ be impossible for Bitcoin to support the volume of say, ACH. So I'm not sure why customers would notice any improvements. In the best case, they're still subject to the same regulatory delays as everyone else, and in the worst case, they couldn't even move their money anyway. 


Security is _so_ much more than that. As though there isn't a giant list of Bitcoin exchanges that lost millions and millions due to intrusions and insider fraud.

Insults are not ad hominems. He didn't make any argument, and he  didn't say he was wrong because he was a kid, he just called him a child. It's a nuanced difference.

Sounds like Mark Andreessen doesn't understand what a blockchain is. 
Just because you restrict the users to a subset of 'everyone', doesn't mean that you also lose decentralized trust. A conglomerate of banks can use a private blockchain, with each contributing hashing power, to maintain transaction history without needing to trust any one as a central authority. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:43:42
Well, sure, I agree with that. Decentralized, proof of work systems are wasteful with little benefit. But that also applies to Bitcoin as it does private blockchains. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:58:45


It is absolutely not a technical one. Existing infrastructure is far more scalable and performant than any system built on proofs of work. 


No they can't. KYC regulations require much more than verifying ownership of a private key. I think you're mistaken about the problem that Bitcoin solves. All a Bitcoin transaction proves is that I held a private key at the time of the transaction. It doesn't prove whether or not I am a politically exposed person. 
Exchanges such as Gemini even go so far as to state that a background check of your identity may be requested. There is simply no way that adding in a blockchain to a bank suddenly solves that problem. 


Again, I think you're mistaken about the problem that Bitcoin solves. Proof of work and Bitcoin's hashing power is required because of it's decentralization and inherit lack of trust. A bank doesn't have that problem, and so existing cryptographic protocols can work just as well, with significantly less wasting of energy. 
I don't need miners to verify that I signed a message to prove to myself that I signed a message. Likewise, I don't need miners to verify when a friend sends me a message. I already trust his key, because we have an out-of-band relationship. 


Right, that was my point. That security is a lot more than "use Bitcoin". So _"Other banking groups will somehow be able to do this while spending less and less on IT security. "Are they not needing to protect their blockchain intranet?" Turns out that group is using an already secure blockchain, on bitcoin."_ isn't really a meaningful statement.

I'm not sure how you can claim it's a technical limitation, and then go on to list examples where using the same "traditional" banking infrastructure (meaning, not blockchain based), they're able to process a higher volume even quicker. 
I suppose it depends what is meant by a technical limitation though. Sure, ultimately it's the infrastructure that decides throughput, whether because of regulatory requirements, or because of the risk/reward of upgrading, or whatever. The larger point is that the blockchain would likely add nothing to processing times compared to existing systems.

We can soft fork every 2 years, and hard fork every 4 years

Yes, banks and credit cards are superior to Bitcoin. I'm not sure what the point of that is. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:30:57
You mean extraordinarily well? Because PKI's are successfully in use all over the world, at scales that Bitcoin can't even imagine. And because most relationships in the world _aren't_ decentralized, and often do have a trusted authority at the top? 
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:33:46
Could you list specifically which regulations protect them from competition? And how does that square with bank consolidation being correlated with the weakening, and eventual repeal of the Glass-Steagall regulatory framework?

Take up arms and claim the land you want, like _every other organism in the history of the universe_ has had to do. What makes you think you're entitled to anything in the state of nature? You don't want to acknowledge the social contract, that's cool. But don't whine because you're not being gifted what you want.

You're saying that the way for a company to keep something secret is to make it available to everyone? How exactly does making my medical records available to everyone ensure that it's kept private? 
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:29:12


All you're doing is taking away the original problem, and adding the blockchain to complicate things. Uber can just not keep the data now, and there'd be no database to hack. But we were talking about how you store sensitive information with the blockchain (either directly or indirectly), so "don't store sensitive information" isn't a solution. 
But still, I'll respond to the proposal anyway. 


So presumably the notary is going to sign either the hash too, or sign Alice's public key to establish that the key does belong to her. How does Uber get the notary public key, and verify the notary signature?
If the notary is signing the data, is the notary validating the accuracy of the data? If not, then what's the point of the notary? 
If it's a driving record, there still of course needs to be a central repository of the data, because driving records need to be updated. Why can't Uber just get signed data from the DMV, either directly or indirectly through me? It still has all the inherit problems of trust that using the blockchain does, but with none of the downsides of the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 17:52:29
I'm not sure how that's relevant. Of course the Internet improves transparency and access, but it's an immutable law that whoever has the most of what everyone wants, has the most power, be it dollars, bitcoins, gold, or IOU slips.  
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:10:54
Those two statements are not mutually exclusive. Regardless of how you store and validate data, be it in an inefficient manner like a blockchain, or with traditional databases and signatures, it says nothing about how people create workflows. You can have an intermediary with Bitcoin, with escrow services for example. Just as a blockchain where banks control the individual nodes can still support direct transactions. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 18:39:48
Can you explain how storing something sensitive, like a driving record or tax records, on the block chain would work, and what the advantages would be over any other storage method? 
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:32:08


Unfortunately that doesn't yet exist. 


This doesn't solve that model. Whether it's dollars or bitcoins, the people that have more will have more power. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:30:42
Can you explain how I'd keep my medical records private on the block chain, but still give access to doctors during an emergency, when I'm unconscious or don't have access to my private key?
