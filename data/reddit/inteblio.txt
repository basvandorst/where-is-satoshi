This is really great. So essentially "the lightning network" acts like an exchange. The total amount of bitcoin _in it_ remains the same, and is transacted. (but can be added to with a single transaction). This information means a lot to me. I highly appreciate it.

Legislation is irrelevant. If you are a legislator, you either allow it, or you die. Countries that "go with it" will work far more profitably. Money makes the world go around, better money means the world goes around better. 
I don't care about any laws for bitcoin. They'll all arrive at something workable in the end.
A government gaining control of bitcoin through 51% is more problematic, but laws aren't. 
I want bitcoin to be grown up enough to engage with society and government. I see it likely that taxes will be inbuilt or very nearly inbuilt.

Unfortunately, it's not in anybody's interest to post information that would help other people genuinely understand the market. Lowstrife is a noteworthy exception. You find that contributors fall silent as they start to understand the market, and only discuss minor matters. Don't write off bitcoinmarkets, but don't trade either(!) that's the  tip they forget to put over the top of it. 98% of traders loose coins. No joke.

Lawsky is a human. He will try to do what is best to please many parties. He will make mistakes. 
Ultimately, any laws are good for bitcoin, as it's the certainty (and non-jail-ness) that big money needs. The stuff lawsky says seems very reasonable to me. Consumer protection matters. The free market will fuck you over, and we the people need protection. That costs money, so would not occur without laws to force it. Good!
The comments on this tread sound childish and insane. Embarrassing even (to a fellow fanatic).

The bastard of it is the future. 
Right now, I don't care if this links to that. BUT, if (when I dig up my coins) in 40 years, it might be a real issue. Probably won't be, but I want to think about it now, rather than regret it then. 
I think you're right that "go whole hog" is the only way. 
Mixers, Tor, under-the-radar trading. I've only got a certain amount of energy for that, but I should give it a go at the very least. 
Oddly: I really believe the future is one of "all information is available" and uber tracking. Bitcoin seems to facilitate that. That said, I don't want to be the easiest to uber track. 
Good luck and god bless.

Can't do that - it's secure.   
You could only roll back to the point when they were sent. Which is not really an option. 
Recently mintpal got hacked and lost all it's vericoin... they rolled back to 'undo' the theft. That's the first time it's happened In Crypto Land and it got a polorised reaction. 
People are tracking the coins though. I heard bitstamp are funny about where people's coins come from. 
You just have to take it on the chin - if you put your coins on an exchange, you run the risk they will vanish. Any exchange.

To the author: 
What's the most important news? price. 
Thought experiment: Do not look at price. Using news alone, try to predict the price movements... and price of coin. Obviously, you won't even be wildly wrong. 
Now, use price alone. Do not look at any news whatsoever. See if you can still trade a healthy profit. Oh you can? how odd. 
Price is truth. It reflects all aspects of the entire market into one, constantly changing number. The graphs inspire emotion. Fear and greed. 
Forget news. 
Some guy on tradingview put all the news events over price. No corellation. 
Only silk road and mtgox have affected price. Possibly china, but china did not burst the bubble, it burst a week earlier on the american side. 
As you say, affects confidence. I think bitcoin is too young to be in the "x company is doing x this week". Bitcoin is just spreading like a virus. 
You (the author) settled your "why did price drop" thing with "oh it's because dell sold some coins". 
I doubt that made any difference. 3600 coins are generated (and sold?) every day. The market is based on fear greed and confidence. 
It's that damn line. It's all that damn line.

I know you're trying to do a good thing, and at least you're *doing something*. This is more of an 'achedemic argment':
I'm a Bitcoin fanatic.
However... you might accidentally be doing [more harm than good]( 
Why did you get into bitcoin?
Because the "investment returns" are insane, and you probably don't trust banks/governemnt debt.
Why would somebody else get into bitcoin? - Because the "investment returns" are insane (banks fine)
Bitcoin is has to go through 'adoption phases'.
1. Nerd-Mining (over/gone)
2. Speculation + price rise (current)
3. Use as currency (future - i.e. not now.)
Yes, bitcoin CAN be used as (the world's best) currency, but that's not it's strength, or a selling point NOW. 
- it's TOO deflationary for use as a main-stream currency
- it's TOO volatile for 'ordinary merchants'. 
It's selling point, is that you stand to make crazy money doing nothing. 
So, how's this doing harm?
Because the "bitcoin economy" is pratically non-existant. Transactions are largely from exchanges to 'buy and hold' addresses, or other non-commerce stuff. That's fine - that's great. 
The number of bitcoiners is actually quite low. Like 500,000 -&gt; 5 million? For us to "fake an economy" is already hard work. And the number of people that will be impressed by the B logo are a very low percentage.
Yes online merchants stand to make money accepting bitcoin (some more than others). Good. Bricks and mortar places just face challenges, and the problems really outweigh the benefits. Unless *they're into it* it's not going to work really (as the sane folks in the [parallel universe]( of r/buttcoin point out) Of course - in years time bitcoin will be everywhere, but we're not there yet. 
If shops accept bitcoin (hassle to setup), and get barely any trade from it (98% likely) in 12 months time they're just going to tell their friends "bitcoin's a pile of crap, it's dead". That's the damage it does. 
Going around telling your friends about getting rich off bitcoin price rise is perhaps the most important thing that we can be doing right now. 
Bitcoin is far more than a way to transfer money. 
It's a get rich ponzi, anti-bank Gold 2.0, and a... currency. "sending money to each other" is the least of it, and will be much easier/safer/more popular down the road.  
Quite a long way down the road.

@_date: 2014-03-13 21:35:15
My proposal (an example version):
Somebody sends you 1btc  
Shortly after, you receive 0.00000007btc.
You google it, it gives you a website, you look up your bitcoin address.
It says 0.0034BTC of that 1 you just got is from stolen coins. 
You realise that people you send coins too will also get this message. You pay 20% of 0.0034 (0.00006?) and you are now cleared.
Or, maybe you tell the site who paid you it, or maybe you fill a form saying "leave me alone" or maybe you just ignore it, because everyone does and you've had 3 already. 
Or maybe you arrange with the person who payed you to go halves on it. They could go halves with the person before. Something like that. I agree it is like blackmail. But the idea is to make the stolen coins harder to spend.
Hey, just think. Some lucky fucker's got 200,000 coins.

You get a lot of total nonsense on that sub. The empty cans rattle the most, however, 1/100 is good, and some is absolute gold. Over a year it helped me define my understanding of the market, mostly by disagreeing with things I read, and testing them. You actually learn some good things about trading there to. Trading is very heavily about controlling yourself... being clear and decisive. I stopped trading because it's immensely stressful, and you don't sleep.

Ok, but other things cost money too. Core devs are not funded either. This "magic soultion" is just "hey, why don't we PAY for the network?!". 
But then you open it up to corruption. I might be easily able to fake having 1000 nodes throughout the world, and just have them all in a room with 1 internet connection. 
etc  
etc  
And meanwhile, I now have to pay $5/month for my use of the network. And why would Senders of money (not receivers) not have to pay. See? issues.

If I throw a bouncy ball really really hard, it ricochets around the kitchen and smashes everything up. I tell you where it landed. I know where I threw it from and how hard. With both pieces of information you can say "yep... that'd happen" but I can even tell you how many bounces the ball did and you'd never work out where I threw it from. The blue line on the diagram is the path of the ball. The intersections are the important numbers.

Logs aside, do you think that the coins I've been sent from my account on X exchange can be linked (easily), or do exchanges use thousands of new addresses each day?

"lower the unit of account."  
Not a problem, as you say, it's perception.
"My dad will never buy a bitcoin because a bitcoin costs ~$500 bucks"  
-what if the price increases 5% a day?   
One day he'll crack. 
"Now we get Aunt Sally on board and that's what we need."  
We don't need aunt sally for a good few years. We need large investors / banks next. It needs to be mainstream in cutting-edge finance/technology before it's mainstream everywhere (sally).
"Volume. It's the first thing any trader points to in 'teaching' me that this thing is failing."  
That might be true, but they're wrong. Maybe bitcoin works differently. Low volume indicates the calm before the next bubble. Maybe it's "taking stock" or falling as low as it possibly can. Whatever, it's not a bad thing - though I'm aware "traditional" traders seem to think it is. 
"painfully unaware of their own biases."  
How could you be fully aware of your bias and work around it? it's impossible by it's nature. All I can say is:   
come over to mine, buy me some wine, spend some time looking at graphs, and you'll come away agreeing with me. Biased or not. 
"Bitcoin needs stability to secure mainstreet adoption."  
Bitcoin phases:  
1. Mining (past)  
2. Speculative money (current) increases the price enough so that it becomes stable enough for  
3. use as a currency (not yet)  
Stability is reached through increased price because each $100 gets a lower and lower % change in price. My hunch is that a 'deflationary' currency actually produces an extreme stability that we've never seen before.
"Chicken or the egg!?"  
Nope, speculation THEN currency.   
Part of bitcoin's genius is that it rewards all participants at every stage. Like a virus, it is set to take over entirely. 
"But there's a problem. Bitcoin is madness."  
It's really not. Unlike normal stocks that are effected by weather / diesel price etc, bitcoin is only based on... technological adoption, which is relatively constant. [all other aspects - including mining] are dirived from this. 
Your point on "whichever crypto the banks choose will win" is an interesting one, but I would argue that bitcoin has it's own strength without banks. Banks won't back a loser, and bitcoin seems to be king still. 
"won't kill banks" This wasn't a myth I subscribed to, if it was one. Inflationary fiat annoys me, and might well get taken down a peg or two [or anihilated].
Banks. Part of bitcoin's potential is it's cruidity. It does not answer many questions - it leaves them open. Open for SMART people (like banks/governments) to make an impact on. That's fine. Bitcoin is maliable, another of it's strengths. 
"buy the entire currency outright."  
No, because a key feature of bitcoin [in the speculation phase]is hoarding. 
Banks want to buy loads? price skyrockets. As was planned. Banks can only buy as many as are for sale. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:54:09


That's what I'm getting at. *It's a problem*.
Mining is financially incentivized. Running a node is not. The money would have to be FORCED out of the network, adding costs to transactions. Good? Bad? that's the discussion. Also, trying to get "the network" to agree to increased fees might not be as easy as you think. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:25:53
If you want bitcoin to succeed, you must appreciate that the current "phase" it is in is speculators investing in it as a store of wealth. It's not yet fully ready to be used as a currency (that's the next phase). Greedy get-rich-quick types are actually essential to stuffing enough money in that price stabilises (higher value = lower % changes). You have to admit that most people are attracted to bitcoin because it's a way to get rich. If they weren't, they wouldn't invest. Bitcoin would be worth nothing, and wouldn't take off. Speculative investment is essential to bitcoin's success. It's all happy and nice.

They know where you live. 
Like I said, I'm sorry. You know about [the $5 wrench technique]( for cracking secure passwords?

As a current consumer, there's barely any point to bitcoin at all. Tipping on reddit, and donating to pages you like is about the limit of it. 
As a "speculative investor" you might get *extremely* rich. (No joke - invest a dollar, and take one thousand out in 20 years. That kind of rich.)
It is international, \*free, \*instant (\*kinda), so it will either take over the world's money, or die trying. 
What is the value based on? Faith that it won't go away. But that's all any currency is based on. 
Bitcoin has insane potential to change the world. Right now, it's just for fun. 
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose entirely. 
- Secure your coins.

To get to the endgame, you have go go through the middle game. For me, The Genius of bitcoin is that it rewards (nearly) all participants at all eras of it's growth. Currently that's speculators &amp; mining infrastructure. Have patience. It will be a decade or more before it matures. And there are brakes on it maturing too fast (paying miners).

Thanks for the post. It's important to take a step back occasionally. Bitcoin fanatics (me) can get pretty mental. Interestingly, a post which soon disappeared made me realise that the current 'massive' downturn is a result of 0.4% of the market being sold. This tells us how immature bitcoin is still as a financial market. The rare occasions financial experts pop their heads up, I think we should pay some heed (and then carry on, in love). I think the financial guys might do well to see just how much the bitcoin hardcore really do believe in bitcoin. Isn't it lovely.
