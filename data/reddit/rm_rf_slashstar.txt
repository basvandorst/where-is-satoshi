[this is just my speculation]
I believe that whatever happens to Gox (whether they go under or come back) the Bitcoin market will take a hit. Not to big, but definitely get beaten down. Personally, I believe there will be an opportunity to buy coins cheaper than they are now within the coming weeks. That is how I am playing it, but ultimately, the decision is yours.

Lol, right. Just like they were supposed to implode at the end of 2014 as well?

Except every major brokerage exchange allows for e-signatures and instantaneous id check via driver license, SSN or passport for verification.

Hmmm....see it took me a few minutes to set up my ETF based account through a large provider. It took less than one business day to fund the account. Pulling money out is extremely easy (takes a business day to confirm and what not). Buying and selling stocks takes fractions of a second to complete. 
When I set up my bitcoin brokerage account....my god did that take forever. A few business days to "verify" my bank account. 2 business days for them to take the funds 2 more business to verify on their end they received them. It was almost a full 10 business days (2 weeks) before I had my bitcoin account set up and fully funded. Now that it is up and open, it is VERY easy to send and receive money through it. I am worried if I ever want to take cash out how long that will take.
