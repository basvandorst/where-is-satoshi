Unfortunately, the app is not an open source.
Here are some features that as far as I know Blockfolio lacks.
- Ability to create multiple portfolios
- A folder/file system where you can better organize and separate your holdings (similar to what you use in Windows OS)
- An option to backup your data and retrieve them in any other device
- Ability to lock your data and retrieve the password if lost
- top 100 ranking coins based on Coin market capilatazition
- Interactive Line and Candle Charts(minute, hourly, or daily)
