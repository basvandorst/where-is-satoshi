5% because:
* We predict the vast majority of products will be priced from $1-10 &amp; we need to turn a profit on our cloud costs
* It's in line with the fees of similar platforms
* Not everything will turn a profit for us. Someone uploads a huge video for $5 and only ever sells 2 copies, that's $0.50 for something that costs us money every month to store
* We're being realistic: we want to create a lasting product with an expanding feature set and we'll need money to do that
* We're a better experience for your customers. They can choose Bitcoin or fiat in our checkout process
* You're welcome to roll your own checkout system to accept BTC, but you won't get our analytics or any future features etc. Plus it's time you'd have to spend, skill you might not have to implement it, money you'd have to spend to host it. 
Credit card fees are usually 20-50c per transaction, not a percentage. Either way, our fees and those of a credit card transaction aren't really comparable as they're entirely different products.

It's 5% per sale. In the case of Bitcoin, the customer would pay us &amp; we'd pay you 95%. "straight to your wallet" is a little misleading - I wanted to be clear that we wouldn't be sitting on any money until a certain threshold.

Read the book American Kingpin. 
It outlines that Ross is a hardcore libertarian believing people have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies.
He wanted to start a revolution, make drugs safe and ubiquitous and cut out what he perceived to be the dangers. 
With the skillset he had to run the silk road, he could make plenty of money working for some SF startup. Money was for sure a motive, but it wasn't _the goal._
