Is there anything about  [the statement at the bottom of this page]( that can be clarified?  


This leaves open the possibility of having your USD frozen with no means of retrieval other than in crypto, does it not?

This is an interesting concept. I'm just not certain how it's achieved any other way than "atomistic individuals acting in self interest''.  
Who decides what is to the collective benefit of all?  Aren't those deciding for the collective really just "acting in self interest"?

So the potential is that you "mine" more Bitcoin (with leased rigs) than if you were to buy Bitcoin on an exchange for the same money?

[Inflation](  
"Today, most economists favor a low and steady rate of inflation." 
 "The task of keeping the rate of inflation low and stable is usually given to monetary authorities. Generally, these monetary authorities are the **central banks that control monetary policy through the setting of interest rates, through open market operations, and through the setting of banking reserve requirements.[15]**"


No matter where you fall on Keynesian vs. Austrian, *you're* fucking wrong.

Not to nitpick, but the question posed in that poll doesn't match your assessment of what they collectively agree on.    [Here is an interesting poll](    and [here is an interesting chart]( both of which--unless I'm missing something here-- indicate to me that the world's top economists aren't bulletproof when predicting the future.

I hated math because it's monotonous.  I would make tiny errors in the intermediate steps that would throw off the end results.  I refused to "double check" the work because it was enough of a pain in the ass the first time.  I sort of fuzz out when I'm looking at too many numbers.  Geometric proofs, on the other hand, were awesome.  
@_date: 2014-08-03 03:27:16


Yes, that's correct.  It's called [Fractional Reserve Banking]( and it's the major cause of inflation.  
Read something once in a while before you throw around your own moronic arguments.

In that case you're paying for everyone else's bank account.  You're being charged for services you're not receiving. Doesn't make it free when you decide to receive those services.

No matter how you try to spin this, you're straight up wrong.
You lost, at least keep your dignity.

In your scenario, most people would hodl in crypto, convert to "stable" coin, then pay through BTCpay.   With lightning(as I understand it) you skip the convert to stablecoin step.  I dont know anybody who holds stablecoins.  Crypto is volatile, but that's why most people are in it, because they expect the price to rise... either eventually or explosively.

But why should we not?  I'm pretty cynical about many things taxes fund.  But one thing I can get behind is righting a wrong.  In my view,  you can't have it both ways.  When you force people to pay for shit based on "social contract", the "greater good", and "civilization",  you are also obligated to pay the consequences that this concentration of power and authority you've created bring to bear.
