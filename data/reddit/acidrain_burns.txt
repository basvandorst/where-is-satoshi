I think of hidden YouTube comments as a feature.

And YouTube loads faster.

I can appreciate a stereotype, but not a sweeping generalization. You must be a Sith, dealing in absolutes...  ;)
I'd been looking at the Bitcoin as something I wanted to be a part of, but I'm a pretty cautious guy when it comes to money, and I sat on the fence for too long. When I finally decided it was something I could put faith in, it was at $50.00. Unfortunately I am not in the U.S. right now, so buying them was very confusing and my options looked way too expensive or sketchy. Buy the time I thought I had found a reputable seller who took the payment methods I had available, I was desperate to get on board before I couldn't afford to be part of Bit Coin. Bought 2 Bitcoins late last week totaling ~$350.00
Did I think of it as an investment? Yes. Who doesn't? But I never thought of it as an investment to be cashed out. I though of it as something that would be there for me, gaining value, until BTC was as widely accepted as cash. Sure, I'd cash out for USD if I was ever in financial trouble, but I always plan to continue buying coins.
Do I regret my purchase? Hell no. This was a bubble. 
My two beautiful coins will still bring a smile to my face every time i see them in my wallet, two little shiny spots of pure freedom in my life.
I plan to buy several more on payday, especially with current prices. I just hope Coinbase can iron out their issues, I was very happy with my purchases, but this delayed pricing is upsetting. 
Anyway, just thought you'd like to know that not all late adopters are just looking for the next bandwagon. Some are just really cautions when choosing wagons. But I have 3 guys at my office now that want to get Bitcoins after they saw me take the plunge, even after the bubble burst.
Also, am I the only one who would like Google Wallet/NFC payments? instead of QR codes? Gotta make my nexus do more work!
EDIT: Update! Just made my first purchases! 2 urls from NerdyChild... so painless, best checkout I have ever used. Feels so good not needing to enter my card number.

I think it would be treated as is those two persons of the Netherlands  both flew to the states, conducted the exchange, and flew back. Not just like that, but close.
