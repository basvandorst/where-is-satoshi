the libertarian free-marketeers in this sub arent gonna like this.
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:55:16
Are you being sarcastic? or are you just a conspiracy theorist, a la Alex Jones, with all that Lizard overlords, Chem trails, Area 51 and Illuminati bullshit.
**Breaking News**: The Government isn't kidnapping and torturing proponents of Bitcoin. 
Stop acting like you are a freedom fighter or revolutionary because you bought some digital currency.
@_date: 2013-10-31 17:52:45
Are you insane? I believe in Bitcoin, but you guys are trying to make it seem like you are living on the edge and might be murdered or arrested at any time because you bought some Bitcoin. I'm not even sure what you are trying to reference in that article.
DPR was not arrested because he was pro-Bitcoin. He is not a political prisoner. He was arrested because he allegedly operated an illegal drug marketplace. Regardless of what you think about our current drug laws, you cant do illegal things and then say you are being oppressed when you get arrested for it.




Some of the people in this subreddit are completely delusional. You, me and even the Winklevoss twins are  not suddenly going to be waterboarded or put into gas chambers because we bought some Bitcoins. 
The vast majority of the public are not interested in buying Bitcoin for political reasons. They saw the news reports that *people are getting rich from it*. They want to make money too. Its that simple. They see it as an investment, not the beginning of a revolution and the end of our current political and economic system. I wish it was, but it isn't.
You wannabe armchair revolutionaries seriously need to pull your heads out of your asses. If Bitcoin ceases to be a good investment, suddenly your imaginary revolution will disappear, but you will still be insisting you are seconds away from being put into a Gulag.
The scary Lizard government is coming!!!! I saw it on Alex Jones!!!!!! They are putting chemicals into the water that turns you into a Communist!!!! only Bitcoin can save us !!!!

can I have a **bit** of that gold?
get it?
@_date: 2013-10-14 22:04:06
How can you consider BTC stable? In the first quarter of this year it went from $20 to $240, then lost 80% of its value in following week. Since then it has fluctuated between $60 and ~$150. 
Also, instability includes upward growth.
@_date: 2013-08-18 01:43:28
someone stole 6000 bitcoins, so they are probably doin ok
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:21:19
Oh ok, thats a relief, just gotta figure out how to do that now.
@_date: 2013-10-03 23:12:05
not the same thing, if you could buy Heroin, Precursors, stolen credit cards on the clearweb it would be gone very fast 
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:14:57
Welp, it was fun while it lasted
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:28:07
am I the only one who thinks having the servers and DPR actually being in the US was a stupid idea?

can someone tell me what language all that code is written in?
I have no idea what the fuck is going on and I want to learn. If someone could point me in the right direction to understanding the technical aspects of tor, that would be a big help.

How many BTC does Satoshi have?
@_date: 2013-07-23 02:16:40
I plan to come. 
I have never bought Bitcoins before, because it seems difficult and confusing.
Can I buy them there, and is there anything I need to bring other then cash?
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:54:09
Christ, after reading some of these comments, I swear to god some of you guys are worse then Alex Jones. I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few of you think the government is controlled by lizards
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:32:30
where does the Hammer and Sickle some into play?
He mentioned Anarchists and thats about it.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:26:11
ignore the douchebags OP.
Some of people here would gladly steal your 40BTC if they got the chance.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:38:09
TIL buying Bitcoin=Rosa Parks
