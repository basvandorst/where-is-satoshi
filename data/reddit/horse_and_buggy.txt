Did I tell you about the week I bought Bitcoin above 19k? Fuck dollar cost averaging

It gained it once before, now time to let it grow organically and not with misinformed mainstream media CNBC hype, fake news bans and FUD, speculative shitcoins "mooning"...
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:27:46
they also helped wipe out my gains from earlier coins

What is Bitcoin core???

You can believe them or you can believe op or you can not believe any of them... Bitcoin is meant to be a trustless system, and it is foolish to not secure your own private keys.

How much are they insured for? Will the insurance be able to pay out all claims, and if not will there be any recourse? They are not FDIC insured, and there could possibly be an "exchange run" where an exchange fails to keep up.

Many software wallets allow you to recover a wallet using the same seed phrase.

What you're really looking for is how many people accept or acknowledge bitcoin as a store of value, at the least.

Somebody once tipped me $1 of bitcoin with changetip, that I just withdrew this year and it was around $20.
    You received a Bitcoin tip via What you wrote must have been good, because fellow Redditor sent you 3,134 bits ($1.00).
        
Looks like sent me $1 tip on Christmas 2014, now worth $50. Thanks buddy, cheers!

Sunken cost fallacy. If its only going to go down, you will only lose more money permanently. That gamble is up to you.

It's simple, for every BTC you buy, recruit 5 more buyers so that when you sell more people have BTC. Then they recruit 5 people and sell, etc...

CAVEAT EMPTOR. As irresponsible CEX.IO was, you were equally irresponsible depositing all of your family's wealth into the exchange, creating the possibility of losing it all.

You can't build computer chips without gold, and a medium of exchange for goods and services. Gold by itself, is pretty much usable only in jewelry. It takes a lot of people, materials, resources, knowledge and exchange to turn gold into useful products that have actual value.
