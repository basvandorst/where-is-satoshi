But they can no longer be connected to you.
As an example you buy those on bitcoin.de. The seller knows who you are, knows your name &amp; co. and which coins you get, he can see and track all the transactions you make with them in the blockchain.
If you now mix your coins. You give the purchased coins to the service, receive new coins from the pool of the service and these are not related to you.

of course there are more anonymous currencies, but they are not accepted everywhere. And if someone wants to mix BTC anyway, he has a reasonably priced alternative. Most mixing services require higher fees (and converting to Monero and back is usually more expensive, especially since it's never 100% sure that you won't get your own coins when you change).

Thank you for your answer!
A voucher function is currently being developed.
There are currently no further references yet, but we recently sent the tumblr to the DNMSuperlist.
If you are unsure, you can test the tumbler with small amounts of coins and give us some feedback! 
Our service fee is only 1% and the transaction fee is 0.0003 BTC. 
It is possible to send small amounts such as 0.002 BTC. 
We also offer a calculator to calculate what amount will arrive at the end of the transaction.
