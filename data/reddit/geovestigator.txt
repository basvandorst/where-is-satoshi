Bitcoin, as per the original design that people bought into, is still alive, it recently upgraded from the Bitcoin-settlement network though
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:30:56
but why? What possible advantages does lte have other than having a morally despicable creator? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:37:18
Didn't you upgrade yet?
Bitcoin has its 2-4 cent tx fees back, you just need to upgrade your bitcoin so your memory pool is no longer always full (like how Bitcoin was designed to operate)
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:30:00
read the bitcoin whitepaper: satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org and read the history and make sure you understand what you're investing into. Bitcoin can be a p2p and decentralized electronic cash for everyone worldwide (though some peopler {who sensor this subreddit} want to change that).
If you like the idea of money no one can censor that isn't expensive to use and has to middlemen, Bitcoin can be got for cheap right now!
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:31:10
Not at all: read more: satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:40:16
that's... not even remortely true....
where do you people get this information?
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:44:21
lol this subreddit is so far from pro-Bitcoin that the idea is nowadays both sad and laughable.
About 2 years ago the lead mod of this subreddit turned it staunchly anti-bitcoin, while banning most early adopters and technically inclined. What remain are the uninformed and those who wish to prey upon them.
Very few people who have any understanding of Bitcoin view r]bitcoin as pro-bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:01:25
ha, I made a post alerting you to $en$so$hip and it was $en$ored!
the mods here are so transparently corrupt
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:47:03
lol I don't know about you but I stopped making txs when they got more than a dollar (but they are low once again now)
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:41:07
you do realize that you need to lock funds away with the LN, making it a middleman, you therefore want to force middlemen on users (and the data cap would need to be roughly 100 time higher than 1megaB to make that happen)
Tell me you understand that
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:27:51
And yet this is all because of social engineering and media manipulation. I have no doubt that without all the sencorship here we would have seen this price long ago! (good thing real bitcoin survives with low fees and not full blocks!)
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:39:52
I believe you can issue a chargeback up to 90 days in most cases, that said bt(c) has fees of only a few cents to get into the next block
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:47:29
it owns venmo which is what banks think P2P means, with a middleman (like the theoretical lightning network)
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:06:24
For everything useful, there is bt(c)
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:44:59
That's pretty much par for the course here, the subscribers to r\bitcoin are almost entierly those that don't understand it and have never done any research on it
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:39:01
Did you not upgrade yet?
Why are you still doing fees over a dollar? I bet your memepool is full too, upgrade your Bitcoin so tx fees are only a few cents and so everyone can use it
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:23:04
I think that's happened to all of us, but hey these day I don't use the coin with the super high fees and that can't be described by the whitepaper. If you believe in BTC and aren't here just to try and get rich, there is a more pure bitcoin out there that is less than a thousand dollars right now. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:09:35
So use a forwarding address, your problems seem simple and easily surmountable. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:26:09
That's not what that word means, apply some thought to it, maybe you might get it one day.
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:05:25
Think about it, a bank is centralized because they control the record. By splitting this power to multiple parties no one party controls the ledger, thus it is decentralized.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:15:14
Where are the pics of the 5 dollar fees that makes me stop using the legacy client?
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:15:07
Ha, with a transcationfee the price of that basket no one will use this settlement coin, there is a working bitcoin though, all you have to do is upgrade and you can too use bitcoin (the one from the whitepaper)
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:31:41
Read the design of Bitcoin before you invest.
There are a bunch of people who don't knoe what they invested into and are unhappy with ibut only after they invested in it, and now they want to change the whole system away from the design given by the creator and designer see it at satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org

Well when all the selling points are no longer true and the legacy chain is only a speculative asset with no utility, do you blame them now?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:19:19
I was wonderiung why the troll count at r/trolls who hate bitcoin has gone up so mcuh
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:46:08
LIke asking someone who doesn't understand what the word 'decentralization' means for proof to back up their opinions. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:50:20
educate yourself before you invest in something, it appears most people who invest in bitcoin (without doing any research whatso ever) end up back here in this subreddit
Here is the design of Bitcoin, the one that everyone read before joining bitcoin, the one that made Bitcoin what it is, the one that is bitcoin, the one that people want
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:33:01
Anyone who joined Bitcoin for p2p or decentralized money and not to just get rich agrees with you. 
People who have no technical understanding and find your comment threatening somehow will argue with you, but they just are pretty ignorant. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:46:55
The price of the legacy coin keep rising but the utility keeps getting less...
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:48:46
Woah there trolomax, let's not idure the newbie is so much propaganda, if they hang out here they'll drown in it anyway  Why not post some facts like

The legacy chain? Well as that is now far removed from the e-cash I signed up for I don't consider it btc anymore
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:16:23
You are talking to a troll user, read their user profile. They don't like Bitcoin and think it should be something whooly different from the whitepaper and they want to force their full block and high fee coin on you because they don't understand what decentralization means. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:08:31
lol not with the core dev's policy of full blocks which lead to everything not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:09:51
Bitcoin is fine if you aren't using the legacy chain. I use bitcoin all the time with 1 cent fees and it's great, it's like being taken back 5 years and everyone is happy and excited. it's not that way here in this subreddit where free talk can't happen and all teh early adopters have been banned.
Bitcoin is fine, just use the right Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:51:58
It's a shame the dream of bitcoin is dead with legacy bitocin
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:14:21
dozens, just google search or checkout with websites bitcoin dot com and others
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:05:43
Even technically inclined people can have a hard time with it, there is so much to learn.
The problem is when people read things online and take them as fact without ever thinking them through or investigating them for themselves, that's a huge problem here.
But the cypherpunk, written in 1992, is a huge basis for Bitcoin and cryptos, everyone should read it, it's only a page long:
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:11:52
And what does that mean? P2P
some people have taken it to mean only between people who run fully validating but non mining nodes, but this is simply untrue. 
By sending directly to the secret key controlled address of another you are sending P2P even if you don't run a node. I mean basic calculations show the network will die congested and unused if the data is capped, people would be able to run nodes but would never be able to afford a tx.
Allowing growth of Bitcoin is the only way to keep it P2P and to not use middleman like LN hubs unless you want to. Keeping blocks full leads directly to centralization
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:03:29
There is much much more to the story and it brings that part into question
@_date: 2017-05-29 04:01:31
Hi, I did post this twice to relevant parts.
It is very true, do you ahve nay facts to counter it?
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:13:23
That's no reason to limit the base layer, no second layers can be used anyway at this time
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:01:44
How do you propose to deal with that? Making ASIC's cheaper so everyone who wants to can mine at home on a more competitive level.
What research or data supports full blocks or any policy other than 'Satoshi's plan'?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:47:31
despite that there is no actual data backing up any of your often debunked claims, can you expand on them some more in more detail? I'd like to mock you further but you need to add something with meat, your bare bones idiot speal isn't good enough
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:33:58
If there are 2 chains and one has full blocks and the other doesn't, the one that works (like bitcoin was designed to) will probably win, because it works, while the chain with full blocks won't work nearly as well.
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:09:29
Cornell shows 2 years ago that FULL 4MB blocks would lead to a loss of *maybe* 500 nodes, while allowing millions of new users and tens of thousands of new nodes.
The authors of that paper even recently said it was out of date and the system could handle more with less loss of *non mining node centralization*
Let's not forget that the word 'centralization' and 'decentralization' come from how modern FIAT is controlled by banks by having control of the ledger, and by decentralizing control of the ledger you have have a currency where people can send money directly to others (P2P) without a middleman who can stop you (decentralized) and you don't need to fear fund loss (trustless)
As we can see ***Only mining nodes factor into decentralization*** 


this is very arguably wrong and untrue, based on the analysis and factual evidence
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:00:37


Not true, as you can see in the posted link ( you can see that he planned for nodes to coalesce into something closer to a data center. He projected some 100,000 or so of these node and mining centers. 
This is not something everyone could do at home, that was only part 1 of a 2 part plan. 
And yes, since '[Satoshi's plan]( is what I and everyone I know 'signed up for' I do think we should stick with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:02:40
Is that intended to contribute to the conversation in any meaningful way? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:15:11
If you are only here to make money ( you'll fit righ tin on this subreddit) but then sure, in the past most people who got into bitcoin did it becauyse they liked the concept and idea of p2p trustless money
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:14:35
From another user:












That's rather different from the "Satoshi endorses 1MB" spin someone might get from reading just that one sentence.
But he also pretty clearly stated that blocks should never be full and miners should be run in big data centers (non-mining nodes having no security importance)

So there is a chain that follows Satoshi's plan for Bitcoin ( and follows technical reasoning instead of political ones (full block greg, we're looking at you)
and yet you want to keep the centrally planned coin, the one that can't be p2p or decentralized? 
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:51:01
If I were the gov I assume I would have a number of skilled technical contractors under the table, these people could be used to start contributing to the client and making vocal and loud comments online. Eventually asserting themselves as part of the team even though they have ulterior motives.
I would use these team members to ostracize those that wanted a end vision of bitcoin different than I did (e.g. I want P2P digital cash, the Gov may want an expensive and highly regulated e-gold settlement system)
Once I had smeared those that wanted a different visiion than I did I would begin to induate newcomers with this false information, tell them Satoshi was never right, his ideas will never work out, those that don't argee want to hurt bitcoin
I would smear any attempt to take back control fo the system and smear any attempt the change the system as being against decentralization (technical and actual facts don't matter just Praise the True Dev team, everyone else is the enemy right)
Controling the means of the communication would be paramount, so co-opting the people who ran such channels would be highly needed, it might be able to be done by using online users that are not tied to any known person but are can assert themselves as trusted.
@_date: 2016-07-03 09:01:17
No one says that.
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:26:40
That wouldn't help full blocks, the 1.7 MB blocks would still be full, it wouldn't affect the backlog people woudl still be unhappy
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:26:03
This sounds completely illogical, where is the logic to back this up? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:29:07
Why? 
Where do you get the data to back this up?
Bitcoin worked, *worked* fine without full blocks, now they are full and bitcoin is doing very badly.
segregated witness gives 1.7MB blocks, they would still be full, not to mention it needs 95% hashpower support which it appears will never happen. 
There is no data that suggests anyone ever used asicboost covertly, and if someone did innovate something, which again no data suggests they used, why is that bad?
