You fools won't get any cheap coins from me :)

He's a bum, we all know what you're here for.

This is no way spreading FUD! I am all for Bitcoin (60% of net worth btw) but it is important to see ALL sides...

Is there any way to do this transfer through Coinbase? I don't want to have to cash out just yet and worry about taxes, etc. Thanks!

The real question is do we try and trade to get some more coins out of this or hodl? I am in no way supporting this but do expect 2018 to be a wild year :)

Lol, woops!
The post was deleted so I didn't see what it entailed.

When you notice nonsense being spewed for no reason, always remember that those individuals serve one purpose - to tear apart the community in order to push their own agenda.

Can someone explain how taxes would be filed in the states for someone who buys and sells over and over? I just feel that would be such a headache to report.. all the deposits/ withdrawals etc.. Ive been a hodler but don't mind selling off some and trying to buy back at a cheaper price. Also maybe converting some of my other coins into btc. Coinbase user btw. Thanks and hodl on!!!!!

I'm freaky.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:21
This for sure
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:27:45
I'm fully supportive of this, but lets not be so naive to not think that more than half of all bitcoins are probably held by 10 people or so. That's an inherent problem.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:59:34
so beautiful!
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:23:05
Can you elaborate a bit on how taxes work when you keep selling and buying back? That's the part I don't understand.

It was a fun ride, guys. Looks like it's my time to 
buy the dip.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:08:55
Don't let them get to you. It does seem odd.. If you planned on waiting for this to all pan out since day one, what should change now. You knew there would be waves!

Can someone explain to a noob how to get their btc out of coinbase and into a hardware or paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:50:20
Despite the recent uncertainty, Litecoin will never be near that price again imo. It's own founder sold lol.
