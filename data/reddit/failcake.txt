Worked like a charm! Thank you very much!

You really think Bitcoins are going to be worth $12500 in two years?
@_date: 2013-07-12 05:57:55
I actually tried to verify my ID but it told me that since it hasn't been 30 days since my first Bitcoin purchase (this was my first purchase), I can't verify my ID. Ah well...
@_date: 2013-04-03 08:32:13
Yeah, but as soon as the ASICs get popular it'll be $20 a month.

Well, I can predict Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean my predictions will be accurate...

Just means more money to be made for those of us who are prepared!

See, I can tell myself that I'm going to dual boot all the time, but in reality I'll end up being lazy and just staying in Windows all the time. Whether or not it's secure, the reality is that for most people Windows has all the programs they need, and it would be pain to find all the equivalents in OSX or Linux.

Haha, believe me, I'm hoping just as much as you that I end up eating my words. To the moon!

I hate to be the guy who posts this image, but [guess where you are right now.](

This is a really small thing to nitpick and I think it's awesome you guys are accepting Bitcoins (I'll probably buy a pair once I can figure out which ones make me look most stylin'), but [this article]( states:


Why Susan G. Komen? Of all charities they aren't exactly one of the nicer ones...

Haha, I definitely agree. Really regretting spending .2 BTC last week that would now be worth way more. I'm not letting go of my last .15 BTC until it's either worth thousands or nothing though!

Rational me thinks the big pop is coming, Bitcoin-owning me thinks "TO THE MOON!"

I love Bitcoin, but am I the only one who thinks we're definitely hitting a bubble right now? Bitcoin has gone up $300 in the past four hours. There's no way that's sustainable. Bitcoin is great, but it's definitely not worth the $900 price Mt. Gox was at earlier.

But... my game collection only runs on Windows...

Now if only Coinbase would let me verify my identity so I didn't have to wait a week to purchase coins...
@_date: 2013-07-12 03:39:28
I bought a few coins on the 9th from Coinbase, then two days later they announce instant purchasing. Meanwhile I'm waiting another 5 days like a chump... at least my Bitcoins will be worth a lot more when they finally get here! Already made some money!
@_date: 2013-08-09 19:45:38
Hey, at least you've made it to Level 2 verified... I've tried verifying my identiy twenty times now and still nothing.
