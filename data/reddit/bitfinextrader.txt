The problem is that during the long squeeze the algorithm stuck the trading engine for regular traders. I was unable to cancel my orders and my balance get update only minutes after the trade. Also the distribution of the coin don't follow the order book but was processed in a way that remain hidden. So bitfinex can cheat and wait that there is enough buy order for sell the huge orders at a higher price without anyone notice it. Any way if they try to maintain artificially the price high by manipulating the orders queue with some algorithms they will fail and the consequences will be much worst.

When you take leverage on Bitfinex you don't buy bitcoin on leverage but you are buying Bitfinexorderbookcoin on leverage.

they are not but they can decrypte your files and give them to everybody that ask them. With Storj you aren't able to do that so you aren't able to cooperate with authority like dropbox.

I didn't speak about fractional reserve. I speak about the price of the so called bitcoin. The price on BTC on bitfinex can be different from the average price of Bitcoin across many exchange.
In other termes you can get margin call on your bitfinexorderbookcoin when the price of bitcoin don't move in the reste of the exchanges. So when you take a leverage you are not buying the trustless asset bitcoin you are buying the bitfinex trust in the orderbook depth.

If the police seize your computer they will ask you to provide the passwords to decrypte the hiden portions. If you arn't able to give the password they will say that you don't want to cooperate and will bring all the shit over your head.
