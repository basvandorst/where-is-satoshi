Got it, I have two. But I can move to an exchange as my third. Fun times. Thanks. Trying to stick with the idea it’s been moved, but yes most likely taken. I went through the entire apt.

Great, I have btc and Eth ... create a clone and then move everything to a new wallet. Got it. Thank you. So I have to buy some more trezors.

Okay, I understand that - but I still use these wallets when I make purchases. Thanks for the additional time delay information. This is my first time losing (or having both wallets stolen / misplaced)...  glad there is a backup.

I have a pin on the wallets. Okay, I’ll take a drive today to restore. Man, I keep looking around hoping they were just tossed in with the rest of my computer stuff.

I’m packing up to head to families and do the restore. Thank you.

Thank you. I had 2 trezor wallets missing; but I’ll do this via two times. I got it. Just a massive headache - and really just been hoping they would show up.

Same. Didn’t think I was that old, ugh.

Okay, but after cloning to move to a new wallet with new keys. Might need two. I’ll sort this out. Thank you

All done - thank you all. It wasn’t difficult to restore - the idea to move to a new wallet with new keys was a good idea, that I hadn’t thought about in the moment. Ty!
