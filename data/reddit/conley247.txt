Thats awesome! You can tell how similar it is to the price of BTC!

So you think the price of a litecoin will be 1/4th of the price of what bitcoin reached?
I don't mind messing with hardware/software and I can make about 1.6 litecoins a day with my 6870. I will save quite a bit of the coins I make and when they hopefully jump up like bitcoins, I can make some cash. If I do this for a year or so I can probably make a lot of money as the price of bitcoins goes up.
Feel free to correct me, but that is kinda my idea.

So to try this would I just paste it into the JavaScript Console on Chrome?

Thank you! (Not sure if you are into LTC but if you have I need at least another 0.1LTC so I can withdraw with the altcoinbot)

Whats the difference between bitcents, millibits, and all those different things?
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:40:18
What exactly is that? How would it affect the market?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:08:35
Haha,yup, and I'm sure that it is probably not even normal letters.

So is it a good idea to mine/buy litecoins? Do you think that it will reach to same price as bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-08-16 12:42:34
For this to happen it would be at the very least 5 years I'm sure.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:36:51
So the exact same thing should happen to litecoins? It will start with a huge jump in price in a year or a bit?
