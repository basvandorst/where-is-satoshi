It is better because we are honest about it. And Bitcoin is giving something really important to the world so it's only natural that early adopters get rewarded, while Dogecoin is just trying to copy that, like all the other copycoins.

You are using the word "meme" with its original meaning. In reddit, people use the word meme as in "funny cat/dog picture".

Bitcoin adoption, price, and hashing power all go up together. If Bitcoin becomes a dominant form of exchange, the total incentive for miners is going to be through the roof, so the hashing power is going to be enormous, and no single country is going to be able to take over the network. And if someone coordinates an attack, others could protect it by temporarily adding more hashing power.

Use cold storage, not web wallets. Make sure to own the coins soon after you bought them, send them to your own address. Don't let them sit on random website.

@_date: 2014-01-23 07:01:17
That depends on where you are located. If it's a "normal" country, without capital controls like Argentina, you won't have any troubles selling your coins for fiat (we use the term fiat as in "government-issued currency"). You can use centralized exchanges online like Kraken, Bitstamp, Mtgox, etc ([here]( you can see a list of exchanges and their prices). Or sell directly to the buyers with the help of sites like localbitcoins.com.
An option that many businesses are using is the payment processor Bitpay. With them, you can choose to have your coins converted automatically into fiat and sent to your bank account (that part might be country-specific). Or you can also choose to keep the coins (all countries) as an investment, which is something you should definitely consider doing if you don't need to sell them right away (Bitcoin's price has gone up x10 every year, and x100 last year).
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:36:27
That's like saying the keys of a car should stay in the car. If you save the keys of your car somewhere else, then what's so weird about saving the keys of your bitcoins somewhere else? And you can always use them safely with Armory or Electrum's cold storage, it's pretty convenient: just create the transaction, sign it with your offline machine and broadcast it with your online machine. I do that to refill my online wallet from time to time, it's very comfortable and secure.

Who said it's the most likely outcome? There is no point for a single entity to create and use a Bitcoin clone, because its security depends on the miners. If a single country decides to use this system, another country of similar capabilities could attack it easily.

In the future you should be able to replace this with either a hardware wallet or a trustless Bitcoin bank.
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:24:36
Everyone recommends paper wallets, but I think the cold storage from Armory or Electrum is much better. It's a lot more convenient, as you can still spend the coins securely using a USB pendrive. With the paper wallet you have to redeem it and destroy it, you can't spend just a portion of it.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:36:22
If someone successfully performs a 51% attack for double-spending, the value of Bitcoin would drop very fast, so they wouldn't even be able to repay the mining gear used. It would make no sense for a rational player. Our fear of a 51% attack comes from irrational players or nation-states that could want to destroy it to preserve the status quo of a world dominated by the banking mafia and the debt-based economy. These nation-states wouldn't mind wasting money in this because it's not theirs, it's just money from the taxpayers who don't really have any say on anything.

No they are not, are you a troll too? You know very well they do it for an economic motivation (spam their copycoin to pull more fools into their pump and dump scheme), and not to show appreciation.

Dogecoiners should set a clearer goal in my opinion.
Dogecoin as a supporter of Bitcoin, that will show how much of a joke Litecoin and other copycoins are, might have some value.
But in every Bitcoin thread that gets assaulted by Dogecoiners, all we see is them very evidently trying to pump the coin, trying to insinuate it's following the same path as Bitcoin, trying to imply it's such an amazing creation as Bitcoin itself (see the comparisons about how "people were sceptical about Bitcoin too"), etc. Might as well just use Vaginacoin or Shitcoin instead. Stop wasting your time (and ours, by polluting every Bitcoin thread) if your goal is not to support Bitcoin. You are *not* gonna get rich with Dogecoin.

Bitcoin wasn't exactly secret, in fact I heard about it in 2009 (butdidn't pay much attention until 2011). It's just that people are now more receptive to this kind of thing since it proved to be a groundbreaking technology and also opened up the possibility of making you rich, so obviously Ethereum will have a lot more attention than Bitcoin had on its first days. In fact Bitcoin was a lot less secret IMO, it was open source and welcoming for everyone to see it and participate since day 1. You could have totally talked to Satoshi and helped him develop the first versions of Bitcoin, mine it, and be a super early adopter (you are an early adopter anyway, just not super). Unlike Ethereum, which already has its "founders" set in stone, and the amount of premined coins they will get. Which will be around 40% of ALL the coins... Seriously? GTFO

The difference is that doge is mostly a reddit phenomenom, so because you see more people talking about it you think it's bigger. It's not. You cheered when you surpassed Peercoin for a second, and now you are back to being smaller than it. And who cares about Peercoin? No one. But it's still bigger than dogecoin.

Maybe you are not aware but "nobodybelievesyou" is one of this subreddit's many trolls (he even got banned in many other subreddits, but has no useful mods). Just dowvnote and ignore him, or say "says the troll" to let others know what he is so they can ignore him too.
He understood your post just fine, he's trolling you.

That's not the reason. The reason is the bitcointip bot was banned from every subreddit.

All of you dogecoiners are such trolls. Stop comparing Dogecoin to Bitcoin, it's an insult. One is a huge technological achievement, the other one is a copy and a joke. Unless of course, you don't even have the capacity to see the difference. You probably don't understand what hard (or actually theoretically impossible) problem Bitcoin solved, or how Dogecoin came to life (just copied Bitcoin's code, changed the name, and added a funny picture of a dog).

Like said, you are not supposed to reuse an address unless it's a stealth address (for this reason, another proposed name was "reusable address"). If you reuse addresses you are doing it wrong and it's not Bitcoin's fault. Maybe what we need is easier ways to generate new addresses automatically. Right now any programmer worth his salt can do that, but we need pre-built solutions to bundle with e-commerce software, donation buttons, and that kind of thing.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:30:02

Namecoin is very interesting, and we definitely need to decentralize the web. But the project seems to have staled, and it was difficult for most people to get started anyway.
Mastercoin sits on top of Bitcoin and it's interesting too and very much welcome.
We have to experiment with everything. But for investing I would stick with Bitcoin, it's the safest bet in the cryptocurrencies world, and still has *a lot* of room for growth. So yeah, to the moon!

@_date: 2014-02-15 01:36:17
The probability of being final goes up with each confirmation. So for example if you are selling a house you can wait for 10 confirmations. If you are selling a car 6. If you are selling a soda you can use an unconfirmed transaction, just wait until you receive it in your own client to know that at least it's well formed, which should be 0-4 seconds.

Not all your peers seem to agree. Just take a look at other dogecoiners' comments in this thread. They are comparing Dogecoin to Bitcoin. They were given the gift of crypto, and they are spitting in Satoshi's face.


If you want to solve the problem of microtransactions, go ahead. But creating another worthless coin won't fix this. Besides, tens of thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin have been tipped in Reddit alone, so I don't know what you are saying. If you don't see tips as often as before, it's because the bitcointip bot has been banned in every popular subreddit. Confirmation times have nothing to do with this, you are just repeating the same as everybody else, without even understanding the logic behind confirmations. Litecoiners do the same: "herp derp, faster confirmations, better!".
I'm glad you can have fun with this, but the minute you try to make a technical argument I'll be here replying to you.
And again, you guys need to stay focused on your goal: To have fun or whatever. Try assaulting other subreddits, because here in r/Bitcoin we are already fed up with your crap (wouldn't have happened if you focused on your goal, instead of trying to pump, spread technical lies, etc).

@_date: 2014-01-10 05:13:37


You mean like Litecoin did? It copied Tenebrix (the first scrypt coin) in case you didn't know, which died overnight, and Litecoin just changed the name and the logo.
Besides, the algorithm change is not really an improvement. Even the creator of scrypt said Litecoin "used scrypt poorly". I'm sorry but not everyone can be a Satoshi. It takes a lot of intelligence and effort.
@_date: 2014-02-05 08:45:32
This is exactly what deserves, a worthless doge tip :)
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:33:52
That's what one means when one says premined. The only fully premined coins that I know of are XRP and NXT. And 40% is **a lot** for a partially premined coin.
@_date: 2014-01-21 00:59:52
Again, you are not good at Math. Those tips will still be worthless. Nobody will wait until their less than a penny tip is worth a whole penny, or even a dollar in the unlikely scenario where Dogecoin reaches the moon.
Dogecoiners are not being "extremely generous".
@_date: 2014-01-17 14:02:39
Are you retarded? Why tip less than a penny? Just give an upvote instead, OP might appreciate it more.
@_date: 2014-02-16 05:36:44
As I said, when I came here everything was removed and I could only read insults, negativity and bitching.
I'm not trolling.
Either you are trolling or you are really REALLY fucking retarded.
You are dogecoin material (if you aren't a dogecoiner already).
Fuck you.
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:10:11
It wouldn't be pointless, it would greatly discourage tipping as it's boring to do it without the verification.
Besides we could also report dogetards and get them banned (if mods were into this). Each ban could prevent hundreds of spam comments that reduce the quality of this subreddit and make us all lose time reading them.
@_date: 2014-01-30 09:59:31
You can't DDOS the network with invalid transactions. You will flood certain nodes, but there will be no propagation. At most, you could DDOS the nodes you are connected to, but not the entire network.

@_date: 2014-01-30 01:48:59
No worries, Satoshi thought of everything. Invalid transactions get rejected by the nodes and are not even propagated. The same with dust transactions. And if a transaction is too small in coins or too young, it has to pay the fee. This way no one can spam the network with the same coins for free. If they want to pay, so be it.
@_date: 2014-02-16 08:49:36

There is no uncertainty and no doubt about any of this, and definitely no fear either unless you were dumb enough to invest in doges. The incompetent doge dev team fucked up as expected, and now the coin won't be capped. Are you saying that's not the case? Will the coin be capped?

Learn about cold storage, you can use Armory or Electrum.

It would also need a stronger dev team, and a better applied hashing algorithm. An actual cryptographer should review its use of scrypt. The creator of scrypt said Litecoin "used scrypt poorly", so it already started with the left foot.
All else equal then yes, it could be as safe. But that's because it's basically the same thing, they just copied the entire code base since it's open source.

Bitcoin doesn't create wealth directly, but it will protect people from having their wealth stolen through "inflation" and other funny words the powerful use to mask their wrongdoings. It will reward anyone who adopts it with the price increase you mention. This wealth will come from the normal economic growth, which nowadays is simply taken by the government and the banksters. The earlier you adopt it, the more you will be rewarded. But it's not that you will take wealth away from late adopters like some people like to say, as if the economy was a zero sum game (that's a fallacy) and Bitcoin a ponzi scheme. For example, if you buy some bitcoins in the future when they are worth $100,000, you won't lose any wealth. As time passes by you will be able to use each of them to buy stuff for $100,000 or more.

And what do you care? Bitcoin is money and everyone is free to use it.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:24:11
Because it's redundant and only speculators and fools are using it.

That question can't be answered as it stands. I'll rephrase it: If the US decided to create an use its own blockchain-based distributed cryptocurrency (aka Bitcoin clone), wouldn't it have more hashing power than the Bitcoin network currently has?
Yes of course. But the incentive for other countries (eg: China) to attack it would skyrocket because now it would not affect random people all over the world, it would affect the US.
Besides the last thing the US wants is to be accountable. With a Bitcoin clone they wouldn't be able to use the magic money printer anymore.

The point of being backed by something is that that something already has value in people's eyes.
Bitcoin is going to be the First Asset that other cryptocurrencies need to be backed by. It's already happening.

Wrong: gold, salt, and basically every other currency before fiat were decentralized.

Relevant username. Are you by chance a dogecoiner?
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:31:37
Uh? You just went full retard. Classic dogetard.
@_date: 2014-01-10 05:46:30
That's just stupid. They are called zero confirmation transactions, and are useful for small purchases, bets like the ones in Satoshidice (because they use it as input for the payment if the player wins, so if it was a doublespend it will get rolled back automatically by the blockchain), etc.
If you are going to buy a house, you want to wait for confirmations. In this case, you don't need it to be fast, you need it to be secure, so you just wait 6 to 10 Bitcoin confirmations and be done with it.
If you are going to buy a soda, you don't want to wait for *any* confirmations. Litecoin's confirmations are still too freaking slow for this use case, so where is the improvement? Use Bitcoin's zero confirmation transactions and be done with it. Nobody's gonna risk going to jail or being beaten for a soda, and even if someone does it, the merchant won't bat an eye, it's just a soda.

That's exactly what it means. Nobel prizes have no meaning anymore.


You said that, not me. But either way he's talking about something he doesn't understand. Bitcoin is not some old Economic theory, it's something new entirely. And it's a multi-disciplinary achievement, not just an Economic one. Do you really think he understands Cryptography or anything about computers for that matter? Remember what he said about the internet.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:39:15
Yeah, because new users of a currency will care about what kind of person I am. How stupid can you be? And that right there is the proof that you are a dogecoiner: you are dumb as a rock.
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:31:56
I don't know why. Mods just ban anything they don't like. And many mods are mods in multiple subreddits. It even got banned in places that should welcome it, like @_date: 2014-01-21 01:02:54
I haven't said that, you said that.
I'm just saying please stop with the technical talk, if you guys can't even do basic Math. You say you are being generous, but you are polluting every Reddit thread with worthless tips (less than a penny). And then you say "yeah but if moon, those tips won't be worthless anymore". Yes they will still be worthless, and you are dumb.

Make sure you learn about cold storage, you can use Armory or Electrum. Don't be the guy that keeps his coins on a website or on his windows online machine and loses everything.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:30:45
As I said, I already answered it earlier, but this guy keeps coming and asking the same stupid shit over and over.
Would you have the patience to answer it over and over and over all day every day like a wikibot or something? Would you not care that you are being trolled?
He's by far one of the most successful trolls here, because not only does he successfully trolls all of us, he also finds retards like you who support him because you can't see through his trolling.

That's retarded, you are just thinking "a facebook but more like bitcoin". What incentive would miners have to mine that piece of shit? Don't try to be a Satoshi, you are simply not smart enough.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:30:13
I don't think he lacks offers of help. Usually non-web devs underestimate the knowledge needed to create a good website, and feel like they can and have to do it themselves. The result: websites with zero conversions or full of web-specific vulnerabilities that they have no clue about.
But hey, it's custom built in c++, so it's secure and fast! /s
I might be wrong about him though, I don't know him at all.
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:46:51
You can't really throw the same worthless tips with Bitcoin, as we don't want to pollute the blockchain with dust transactions, so they are not allowed. If Doge ever ends up having some value, it will run into the same issue, as it has literally zero improvements over Bitcoin (in fact Doge is already behind because its devs don't keep up to date with the development). Or will ignore it and have its blockchain spammed to death.

Building a stupid website is the least of our problems. An exchange will always need ties in the physical world, and if a country doesn't want innovation there isn't much you can do about it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:18:08
Bitcoin could very well just die before we find definitive proof of anything. And I care much more about Bitcoin than I care about whatever reputation you think GHash has.
Besides, a single pool owning the network is a problem, even if they don't attempt to abuse their power.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:19:09
It's not interesting at all IMO. There are a thousand things that can be done to scale Bitcoin, and free market will decide on the fee. Doge is redundant and dumb, their incompetent dev team has contributed nothing to solve the technical problems cryptos (will) face.

Mining has become an arms race, and nowadays using a CPU for this is like using a sword in a war. You are not gonna get any coins with a CPU, you need an ASIC miner.
If you want to invest in Bitcoin, the best way is to just buy coins and hold. Mining is difficult and uncertain. You never know when a new big miner will come into play and take all the coins.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:14:47
ASICMINER does this because they care about Bitcoin (for the cause and the profit too obviously). They know decentralization is important.
