If a house price goes up per inflation, but you are taxed on the new fiat price vs the old one, you can't sell and go buy another house anymore. The asset protects against inflation, but if you sell, you pay a tax on the inflation, but you haven't gained anything. A system of printing money with capital gains allows the government to take a portion of people's assets.

I agree there are some trust issues here.
At Google, Hearn's job was to protect the internal network, which he famously left completely unencrypted, co-incidentally allowing the NSA to listen on all internal Google traffic by simple tapping. He then pretends to be surprised after Snowden leaked the NSA direct access into Google. That is an obvious give away.
Gavin immediately went to the CIA with bitcoin in [2011]( which prompted Nakamoto to disappear from the project and never communicate again. The project itself, and all early adopters, except Gavin, were there to fundamentally escape government financial controls (the cypherpunks), however Gavin's first thought it to bring it to the CIA headquarters? He must have already had contacts and relationships in the CIA for this, and the 'presentation' has never been seen.

Philosophically agree, and people like you and me will do peer to peer while it is still cheap and we can get our transactions into blocks... but most people don't care about any of those things, which is why people use banks and paypal (yes... most people like these things). Off blockchain makes sense... is far cheaper (free), transactional in database terms, not dependent on the bitcoin network / block sizes / miner confirmation tricks / malleability attacks, and immediate. Every company/exchange/processor/service etc have to and are doing this already, blockchain is for large settlements. A world of localbitcoins with full bitcoin clients doesn't scale and doesn't need to.

ahh, no, don't think you understand inflation. It means there was 10% inflation over 10 years. this is monetary inflation. all commodity prices from oil to property to silver to bananas give similar numbers. don't believe it at your peril.

based on price history, US laws haven't had really any affect on the price, but chinese laws and exchanges have easily been the most influential in bitcoin's history. btc china became the largest exchange in the world, and caused the price run up to 1200, then back down after it was blocked.
the article is also obviously wrong, since it claims 'asia' has 13.3 million funding, but ok coin and btc china alone had 10 million and 5 million recent funding. i am guessing they just dont have visibility into chinese and hong kong and other places.

i did see that bank run, it didn't actually seem serious, and nothing compared to the complete banking meltdown in the US, and [constant bank failures]( i do expect corrections as always, large ones too, but the size of economy is not in doubt...consumer and business market segment from cell phones, to autos, to electricity, to luxury goods is larger (sometimes significantly larger) than the US already. many thing dwarf other economies, like macao gambling is 700% bigger than las vagas, steel production is 700-800% larger than US...
i think the numbers are clear. cognitive bias i think causes US to feel like they are more dominant than they are, and chinese to overestimate US power. their thinking is still from the 60s-70s (when mao's paper tiger claim came back to bite him).

you don't own the property at all with a mortgage, the bank owns it outright, after lending you counterfeit money to cover the purchase price (that is out of reach of savings due ironically to the counterfeit money lending), then charge you interest on that money (obviously should be illegal under usury, and still is illegal in many parts of the world), where the rate can be changed at any time to any rate the bank wants, then you can be left with nothing after paying much more than than the original purchase price. banks are then encouraged to loan to those people they know will default, because they get the loan payments while the person can pay, and the house when they default, and interest free money from the fed to cover any losses to the bank

This discussion is immature across the board, with todd on twitter, but across the bitcoin community. The biggest problem with bitcoin has been the community, from the bitcoin foundation full of bad actors, to most businesses being scams or incompetent at best, to the typical egos of young developers. Unfortunately when satoshi left, the direction, vision, tech lead, and maturity left with it. But i do think gavin is the most reasonable one of the lot. Todd comes across as immature, egotistical and arrogant, talking about how Satoshi didn't know what he was doing on bitcointalk, or this twitter post trying to imply gavin is not capable.

i dont think you get how government works, if there is money to be taken, they will take it, either ignoring laws and sense, or making new laws
@_date: 2014-07-04 16:10:04
it is unbelievable that government thinks tracking every financial transaction is assumed and given, and now it is a problem when people can transact themselves! It is a basic human right that people can transact without a middleman or interception. And they actually use the meme '...because terrorism'!
And ironic and insane they talk about consumer protection when it has just been proven over the lat 10 years the regulatory structure works to undermine consumers and transfer wealth to the rich. Bitcoin was made, and people use it, to get out of this system and protect themselves from the banking and fed structure!

'bitstamp' has nothing to do with 'blockchain networks' and does not mine, it is just a company running an exchange. A company like bitstamp would be expected to run their systems in a data center, unrelated to any 'general tendency of blockchain networks'. A node at home is much cheaper than a AWS host, and gives any person the full capability of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:27:23
most activity is probably not on the blockchain. a user will buy on an exchange (no bitcoin address or bitcoin transactions), transfer to services like changetip which will keep pooled money in common or cold storage accounts, then perform unlimited activity with no amount in a personal bitcoin address, and have no bitcoin transactions on the blockchain
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:39:06

buying and selling on a exchange are not 'bitcoin spends', trades are not on the ledger
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:42:03
yes, agree too, although even large holders and businesses often just keep their holdings in exchanges (mtgox showed that), and use services like coinbase or bitpay. Especially if it grows out of the inner tech circle, i don't think anyone will actually run wallets, most activity will be off blockchain, and everyone will use third party companies, like 'banks' (kind of defeats the original purpose...)
@_date: 2015-01-25 06:10:13
it was a sneaky move, in 1971 US defaulted on all internation debts, they made a new currency called 'fed notes' that were just fiat, and most people think it is the same US dollar
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:12:11
hmm, not sure. not with something like USD where the amount and distribution is arbitrary and secret. the price of anything can be increased or decreased by the fed. they even stopped publishing basic figures like M3 in 2006. when i compare economies, i compare stats like kw electricity production and usage, refrigeration unit production and consumption, mean salary / cost of living (to divide out the fiat), etc
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:15:44
I agree, mining seems to have a centralisation problem. I would be interested to see the reason or benefits of using AWS for their hot wallets. Maybe it is just for ease of use. Maybe their existing data centre had physical access concerns. But as noted elsewhere, they might have a bigger security problem by being in US jurisdiction, where a secret law can require amazon to hand over all data and access to govt.

@_date: 2017-03-03 08:26:24
you can't buy any number of bitcoins at the exchange price...the exchange price is just where the order book meets, as soon as you buy the next offer is at a higher price. also only a tiny fraction are even available for sale, so you could never get enough.
right now, on bitstamp.com, to get 2000 bitcoins (0.0095% of bitcoin), it would not cost $1270*2500 = $3.175 million, it would cost $3.9 million and push the price almost 3x to $3500. but after that, the it keeps rising exponentially...to get 2830 bitcoins, the price would then move to $8000 per bitcoin, and you have exhausted all orders at 2842 bitcoins where the asking price is 1 billion dollars per bitcoin! you still don't have a meaningful quantity. of course big buys don't go through exchanges, and more sellers might jump in, but it illustrates the problem.

yes he did
@_date: 2017-04-30 09:36:37
It seems the main issue is because segwit for some reason is being used to block the block size increase, which divides the community. It is a big segwit vs block size increase ego war. But they are both separate and independent, both can be considered separately, and both can be be done. So for me, the main problem with segwit has nothing to do with segwit, it is the pretend narrative that it must be either segwit or a block size increase (core vs unlimited). segwit itself seems like a nice idea to reorganize the blocks to solve malleability. Although it seems to be a large change to the block structure (maybe more suited to an altcoin than redesigning bitcoin at this point).

i think you are dreaming of riches. it already hit the tipping point going from a cent to over $1000 (100,000x). the big money came in and the price already has the future potential built into it. hopefully it should grow steadily over many years as a long term investment (assuming adoption grows well).

@_date: 2015-02-08 19:39:17
it is not that simple. even assuming 1% of all bitcoins are available for sale, each buy pushes the price up. eg on bitstamp, you can buy the next 100 for $22.3k, but to get the next 10k it is $2.67m (you had to get the last few hundred at a price of 380). There are only 11,900 btc available on the public order book, and getting just these would cost $5.3 million (0.08 of all bitcoins) .... cost will be exponential....
@_date: 2015-02-18 21:44:39

they chose to spend billions and suck up the world's talent to build a walled system for nothing except control of content and to try to replace the free standards based web internet model. along with the useless effort of every business having to translate their existing apps into java/android. they could have built a better mobile OS based on existing web standards in 1/10th the time and effort. they also could have monetized that model.

some of those are bizarre arguments, and are the reasons to use bitcoin. difficulties in setting up accounts, using banks, getting and using credit cards, transferring money, especially overseas, and the associated costs are reasons to use bitcoin (the whole banking system is a nightmare). fraud in financial services, credit cards, banks, investment schemes, stock markets and trading fraud (not only all the illegal stuff, but the legal stuff like naked shorting, stock manipulation, insider trading), funds, scams, etc are rife, and a main reason for using bitcoin. difficulties in labor contracts, legals, and getting paid is a major reason to use bitcoin. the us dollar is far more intertwined in illegal drugs and arms smuggling and payments. all current currencies are rapidly depreciating, with the inability to know what is going on with the money supply, is a major reason to use bitcoin (the whole banking system makes no sense to me). (if you keep US dollars in a bank, your savings are going down about 10% per year for the past 10 years, keeping a piece of gold under your bed has outperformed all standard dollar based savings/investment schems for at least 20 years). you can buy pretty much anything with bitcoin, or just convert it back to currency if you need it. i do agree you have to be savvy in keeping them tho.

also by the way, the euro has only been around since 1999, and the usd since 1971, so bitcoin is already pretty mature at 4 years old. most people were predicting the euro to completely collapse and end in 2009, only 10 years after creation.

first? the usd collapsed in 1971 and US defaulted on all its international creditors because of the vietnam war. after some restraint it eroded 50% from the 2000's until it collapsed in 2009 by another 50% in 2 years. That sent the US poverty rate from 7% to 15% (the worst ever on record and double china's poverty rate) and median real wages to lower than the 1960's (wiping out any gains over an entire generation for over half the population), and currently 2 trillion a year from the fed is created and siphoned via to 'banks' and corporations as zero interest loans (never to paid back obviously) so shareholders can keep up their lifestyles...how bad does it have to get for your 'event'? although many are expecting further collapses in the usd...

i agreee! it is worse than that, because governments have no say, since the issuance and power is with central banks, which have no oversight by government, and issuance is not currency, it is debt.
i think in theory, governments could transparently control issuance acting on behalf of the population. but this is nowhere, governments neither issue currency, have no transparency, nor act on behalf of the people. so you have the current situation, where private banks issue currency in secret in any amount and any time and only to maintain their power structure. not one cent goes to the poor.
i don't think it is an economic issue, it is a rights issue. people should not be forced into anything, even if it is argued to be better for the 'economy'. banks should be able to issue gold / silver / whatever backed currency (notes or digital), or people can use fed notes if they want too, or bitcoin. it is almost impossible to change the current situation though. ron paul was the only one with [legislation describing the steps to allow this]( (obviously went nowhere).

its not as simple as that, have you tried to buy a house? banks drive the price of housing, so a person cannot just save and buy a house, they have to borrow for it. to raise the price of houses, the banks just offer lower interest rates (the extra money is just counterfeit, i.e. 'borrowed from the central bank'). someone else will enter into the loan and get the house ahead of you. it is not supply and demand, and you wont get a house by saving up and buying. the financial system (forced onto the public through laws) essentially makes people pay half their income for 30 years to banks, none of would exist if there was sound money and a free market.

a noobie is far safer in bitcoin. the state of the banking sector is a major reason to move to bitcoin.
* a bank needs all your personal details (which is sells along with your entire transaction history to marketing firms)
* you need to be physically there, are only open 9-4 mon-fri (difficult for people working a lot)
* you need to apply for a card, deposit money, wait for the mail (hopefully is doesn't get lost or stolen)
* internet banking is a nightmare for noobies
* account fees, statement fees, transaction fees, fees for going below a balance
* they default to overdraft (and make it difficult to change), add overdraft fees, and start charging you interest on your debt without telling you if you accidentally go over (very common with bank noobies for people struggling financially to get out of this trap)
* they have limits for transfer, flag certain amounts to the government
* wire transfers take many days or a weeks, are easy to get wrong, can cost $20-$60 for a single transfer
* charge big fees for exchange rates, charge fees for buying in other currencies
* have no easy to pay for goods in other countries or outside the banking system or people without bank accounts
* have you read the book that is the terms of service and PDS?...i bet not (it is not possible to understand)
* they make you have multiple accounts the complex rules just to extract more fees (saving, checking, business, etc)
* can seize your money at any time
* you have to worry about fiat devaluation (most people don't realize they lose at the minimum 10% per year holding money in a bank from devaluation)
* address changes usually result in lost cards, statements, etc, 
* credit card fraud is everywhere and banks have horrible safeguards (massive number of victims every year)
* all of this banking stuff is not even possible in most countries (very few countries have safe and honest banking systems)
* governments can block banks or entire countries at any time (have you tried buying something from a local iranian seller?)

in short, bitcoin has better monetary properties than USD


you are describing the USD, and why bitcoin was created and preferred. USD is counterfeited, created in secret by the trillions, comprises most of the worlds illicit drug, money laundering, and secret military spending. 


you think you do, but you don't. trillions are created at will, in secret, and provided to only insiders for for secret military / drug deals.


your dollar has depreciated 280% in 10 years (based on oil, gold and other things that back the US dollar). it is the reason why the real median wages is lower now than all the way back to 1970, and the poverty rate has doubled to a staggering 1 in 6 people. that is why people ditch the USD, wealth confiscation.


no you dont, they are created in secret in trillions, all digitally created, all in secret, by a few people.


USD is not backed by anything, and can be counterfeited. bitcoin is backed by the worlds computing power and cannot be counterfeited, so has better monetary properties.


what does that even mean and why is that good? USD is not state backed, because congress gave up issuance and control of all money issuance to the federal reserve, and done in secret without any any input from voters or laws.
