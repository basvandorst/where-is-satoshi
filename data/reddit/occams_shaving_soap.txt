Stop and think about it for a second. If crypto market caps increase (or decrease) to the tune of billions of dollars in merely a day or even hours, that money is coming from somewhere. It’s also not being invested in stocks or other trade devices. The mainstream media are all controlled by a few enormous publicly traded companies. Nah. No conflict of interest to see here. Move along but read the bad news first.

So what exactly do you expect to gain by coming on here and posting a lot of stale news that merely reinforces mainstream media perceptions of crypto?

It always strikes me as funny how all of us on this sub constantly speculate about movements and patterns and such while literally billions are changing hands on a daily basis.

So there’s this girl I really like and I need a LOT of money to get to the point where I can make her happy and we can live a comfortable lifestyle. Is investing in Bitcoin the way to go?

I have been buying bitcoin for a while now and I’m starting to think it is not going to increase in value so I can get a return on my investment. Should I sell now at a minor loss or continue to hold? I have invested most of my savings so I’m concerned about it going down and losing everything.

So I put together a little informal poll. 
Do you invest in Bitcoin because:
   A. You believe it is the future of money
   B. You believe in the tech behind 
       blockchain. 
   C. You believe it will rocket to the
        moon and enable you to retire. 
   D. You are tired of centralized banking 
        and currency.
   E. You’re just a rebel and despise 
       anything conventional.

I wonder if there will be a day when all these sellers will look back and say “What the fuck was I thinking?” Hodlers gonna hodl.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:16:47
I think the general day-to-day transactions are buys vs. sells that are propelled by profit taking, stop losses, bots, etc. (See r/bitcoinmarkets for the players). The larger candles, I believe are accumulated/aggregate trades by the larger exchanges. Or perhaps a whale here or there cashing out some of his bags. Hard to believe bunches of small traders would collectively dump 500 points in one shot.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:02:24
Is anyone aware of a statistical analysis that breaks down Bitcoin sales trends by the hour, day, week and/or month?

All I can see when I witness this tripe is that the Big Banks are starting to feel the heat and they’re passing that heat on to the Federal Government. The real issue is when, not if, the finance system decides to rape the average citizen like in ‘08. Hopefully Bitcoin will be firmly entrenched by then.

If you’re so concerned about the value of cryptocurrency and bother to take the time to comment about it’s worthlessness, then why waste your time commenting here? Do you really think you’re going to convince anyone to stop investing? Vote with your dollars in any potential investing scheme you feel worthy and stay away from crypto.

I just kinda sit by and chuckle at all the speculation on this sub and a few other relevant crypto subs. Everyone is treating bitcoin like some traditional market medium when everything it has done has defied conventional wisdom. There are so many players and international influences including whales, hodlers, shady exchanges, rampant speculation of government regulation and ETFs, wild predictions of mass adoption, angry reactions to losses. What a great time to be involved in this crap. Let’s go. We’re all going to be alright.

Like any question pertaining to investing or personal finance it really gets down to personal taste and willingness to stomach risk. Many (myself included) took a huge hit in the crash of ‘08 so the idea of stocks being immune to market setbacks is illusionary as well. As cliché as it sounds, I began investing in crypto because I believe the technology of blockchain will be commonplace and will drag bitcoin and select altcoins into the forefront of investment options (and yes, a stable medium of exchange). Stocks, on the other hand, seem increasingly volatile in an uncertain and unstable political climate. Mass adoption of blockchain and crypto, to me, is not a matter of if but when. And when it is adopted it will be on a scale unlike anything in history.

Without regard to prices, bull or bear opinions, anonymous bashing of either that is typical of reddit, the thing that is most encouraging to me is the continuous positive news of the adoption of blockchain technology not only by the coin and token projects but across a wide spectrum of uses and applications. Currency, if the term can be so broadly defined, is only one aspect, and a small one at that, to indicate a paradigm shift taking place in how businesses and individuals exchange thoughts and ideas.

I think your opinion is shortsighted. What were the “early days”? Lots of assumptions regarding infusion of institutional money. Mainstream media and big banks hate crypto so I don’t see any big institutional money coming soon. I won’t spend a dime using bitcoin until I can be convinced it won’t be taxed. The “big drop” from the end of last year was due to a lot of hype and over speculation. Not “watching out”. Just sitting tight until manipulation ends.

It’s probably unfortunate that anyone who visits this sub gathers a perception about crypto from the types of posts you describe. But a vast majority of participants in the sphere probably look on this with a modicum of humor and skepticism. Reddit, after all, is sort of the resort of simple thinkers and not the place for serious investors to engage in meaningful discourse. Especially when it comes to crypto.

What would you do if you woke up tomorrow and Bitcoin started rocketing in price? I mean, do you have a goal or threshold where you would sell and what would that value be? Would you ever be concerned about a serious collapse after a huge leap?

    -Suffered 75% loss while continuing to

    -HODLD through market downturn
    -Continued periodic BTC purchases 
    -Currently at 100% plus on initial
       investment. 
Strategy? HODL. Not your keys, not your coins. In it for the long haul. Let’s do this.
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:47:52
I’ve noticed as well the Ledger providers undervalue Bitcoin. And by a sizable sum. It could be some delay or an interface issue. All I care about is the exit ramp value if I decide to sell but that ain’t happening anytime soon.

Well I think the 30 day RMI with a 20% Fibonacci retracement points to an overall exacto MA of 3,000 boiling points. Then the Bart H&amp;S with a 25% retraction fueled by the Whale influction of a reverse H&amp;S leads to a big dip on the 60 day reverse exacto upside down Fibonacci retraction of the third order. There you go.

Every time crypto tanks people always look for direct correlation to some news story or weird posts on twitter or something else. It could be whales manipulating the market.

I’ve read through your comments here and I believe your investment in crypto is the least of your problems. I have to wonder why you reiterate this theme of being a loser and a failure. This points to deeper self-esteem issues you may wish to address through counseling. Failure in investments is nothing to beat yourself up over. Many of us have lost like you, some with much more dollars at stake. IDK your age but if you’re young consider saving and investing in a balanced portfolio that will garner many times compound interest over your lifetime. There are no get-rich-quick schemes and a lot of people bought into the crypto hype. That said, hold on to your coins because better days are ahead. Take it from an old fuck who never learned to save or invest smartly. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:13:59
IDK. I just figure at some point it’s going to take off and you can kiss these prices goodbye. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:59:05
Get to know this community. Simple breakdown: long term hodlers, medium/short/long indecisive investors, short term/immediate return players. Then you have the big money whales/legacy investors cashing out and pumping to entice new investment. It’s a mixed bag. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:56:02
Can someone please explain, and I’m not necessarily new to crypto, how moving one’s funds to a private wallet works when they will ultimately have to reconvert those funds to some sort of exchange to cash them into fiat. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 01:49:17
It never ceases to amaze me how knowledgeable contributors to this sub have to constantly go back and reiterate the fundamentals of bitcoin and blockchain. One would think the naysayers bent on destroying bitcoin would have something more entertaining to do with their time.

Seriously, OP, What’s the point of posting this mainstream media drivel? What do you expect to do? Educate and warn investors in crypto? Do you seriously think we will just go and sell off because of CENTRALIZED BANKING AND MAINSTREAM MEDIA WARNINGS ABOUT CRYPTO THAT ARE REPEATED DAY IN AND DAY OUT ON THIS FORUM?
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:07:41
Whew! Glad it’s all make believe. That means I haven’t lost anything.

You are 100% correct feeling this way. Bitcoin is a huge Ponzi scheme and all of those stories about Lambos and yachts are fictitious. Tell your friend if he doesn’t change his ways you will no longer hang out. Bitcoin is the work of the DEVIL!
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:10:58
I understand the dynamic of using bitcoin as a currency but for lack of profit and fear of tax that is not yet an option as many of us are underwater. I have no desire to cash out soon. All I was getting at is that if the exchanges are viewed as evil holders of keys, how to people intend to cash out, at any point, without the assistance of exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:04:41

Good question. Well, there’s only ~21 million in circulation and a sizable number are lost or otherwise unaccounted. Then you take the difference, ~3-4 million and estimate a possible timeframe when the supply will run out (some estimate around 2048). At that point the number of bitcoin in circulation X the value of the coin will be the absolute maximum value of bitcoin. That’s the best answer I can provide but I’m sure someone can embellish it.

Cash out. More available for me.

Wow. Scary. And actually a very solid argument for blockchain.

Just waiting for my deposit to clear to buy. Would like to see a little more dip but good either way. Hodling!
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:36:30
Wow! This is it! Here we go! So excited! Wheee bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:52:56
You can watch it in it’s entirety right on the CBS news website.
@_date: 2019-05-28 09:34:03
Hmmm. Lots of selling going on! Let’s get some more buyers and pump this baby up!

I think the problem of mining is overblown. So China decides mining isn’t profitable and shuts down their mines and sells their equipment. Certainly others are more than willing to buy their equipment and fill their shoes. Another crazy non sequiter surrounding bitcoin. Follow the lies, sell the news, buy the rumors or something like that.

If you have a Coinbase account you already have a Pro account. Just go to pro.coinbase.com and use the same login/password as your regular Coinbase account. The only thing different is you have to fund your USD before you can purchase bitcoin. It takes a few days. Good luck.

Oh boy! Here we go! Taking off again. This could be the really BIG ONE!

Oh boy! This is the real deal! Awaaaaayyyy we go!
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:39:58
Oh, no! It’s going down!

FUD - ☑️
Bitcoin dropping - ☑️

FOMO - ☑️
Buying more Bitcoin - ☑️
How low does it need to go for you?
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:29:49
It’s going up again! Oh, boy! Go, Bitcoin, go!
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:32:52
Dang, bitcoin, STOP! Four more days until I get paid. Sheesh!
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:15:22
Yeah, apparently it turns out this story is dated and Gigawatt has since filed for Chapter 11 protection. I thought the $1500 annual profit figure was a little slim. Poor timing.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:57:50
How about both?
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:45:04
I don’t understand what’s going on with bitcoin. It is going down, down, down! I bought in thinking it would go up! What is happening? Sad.
@_date: 2019-05-30 06:56:32
I hate to admit ignorance on this matter, but could someone please explain to me exactly what is “running a full node”, how to do it and what the benefits are, or point me to a laymen’s tutorial? I appreciate your help. Thanks.

I think once major players start figuring out the benefits of blockchain (which is already happening) we’ll all recognize a paradigm shift from traditional monetary systems. The non-traditional inevitably evolves into the traditional. In merely five to ten years society will not blink at crypto transactions. We’re probably a small minority as early adopters but we’ll probably drift into the shadows as hodlers. Albeit wealthy hodlers. lol

Reminds me of a joke. Why is a banjo solo like an orgasm? You know it’s coming but there’s nothing you can do to stop it. lol

I just chuckle at the bitcoin community with all the s$&amp;amp; and speculation 
and back and forth penis fencing. Y’all need to just chill and let it do it’s thing. You’re all gonna be poor or rich one way or the other. Why engage in futile yelling matches? Relax. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:54:53
Here we go again! Oh, boy! This is gonna be the real deal!
@_date: 2018-12-29 11:52:08
I suppose I’m just saying belief=confidence. I can’t see people investing this much time and energy as well as $$ in something doomed to fail. That’s all. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:47:36
Why do people keep selling bitcoin? If they’d just not sell it would keep going up up up!
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:39:09
Steady as she goes, Mr. Sulu

We’re all gonna be rich, I tell ya’, RICH! This bitcoin thing is gonna make us all GAZILLIONAIRES!!
