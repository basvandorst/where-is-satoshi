Freenet is the way to go. Anonymity already taken care of. Integrate market with web of trust and 'bof' (bitcoin over freenet).

If you tried to read the article or info on their site you'd find out.
@_date: 2014-06-22 14:45:32
But the issue is that its easier for politicians to talk negative about bitcoin and use that to taint bitcoin. 
You cant do that with cash.

Hehe. Honestly at times its very scary. But you learn to suppress the fear and move on. Thats one of the reasons why i enjoy climbing so much.
@_date: 2014-05-11 20:57:34
You all act like mormons.
@_date: 2014-09-02 20:01:19
Thats the same amount i now 'earn' with my jalapeno miner in a month.
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:47:57
Thats a honor coming from you. Thank you for the awesome work you do to help people.
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:46:13
In a place called Bortelid in south Norway. A couple of hours from where i live ( kristiansand ). This was a 7 hour climb. 4 hours up 3 hours down. About 8 or 9 pitches if i remember correctly.
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:08:23
I fully agree with you.
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:55:30
I use paypal and bitcoin for my bussiness, but i never let the money sit at paypal or exchange, cash out all the time.
@_date: 2014-06-29 19:25:28
Norwegian here. I use justcoin.com . They have norwegian bank account that i send to, when it goes through i buy btc. As easy as paying a bill.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:13:29
You have the option to have a pin code and a pass phrase as well.
so it feels very secure.
the seed is up to 24 words also.
@_date: 2014-08-02 18:55:28
I too am now a previous electrum user.
@_date: 2014-07-26 15:20:11
Dalen is fantastic. I live in Kristiansand,  but i often drive over the mountains to Dalen. Next time ill bring yhe family there and pay with bitcoin. Thanks for sharing!

Why wait? if new firmware is released it takes 10 seconds to flash it with latest firmware :)
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:28:19
Got my gamekeys today. took much longer then expected. But i got it.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:24:06
I dont need 100 reddit posts telling me the damn price all the time. Im perfectly capable to check it my self.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:38:27
Ive used them a lot. Always ok response. I bought some last night which i have not gotten yet. But i wont call it a scam.
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:27:26
I hope this spreads.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:57:04
Yeah. Its awesome. Really easy to set up, secure and well integrated. Smaller then expected too, which is nice.
@_date: 2014-08-02 16:49:50
Yup. From kristiansand. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:55:09
it takes much more then 4 days for them to create and verify an account, then deposit money for then buy bitcoin and then send that. also do not forget it takes time to get the money out of the exchange and into your bank account as well. a simple wire is much easier.
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:14:27
lol no. smells like a bad attempt to scam people.
@_date: 2013-05-11 20:50:51
I would definately buy it if I had the bitcoins to do so.
I had 28 btc some time ago, but It's all used up now..
I also see that you are also from Norway, what city are you in?
Also spec's on the scooter would help (mileage, cc and so on).
@_date: 2013-08-29 22:15:06
you guys are all mad because he has hit the nail on the head. its funny because it's true.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:40:35
use electrum instead. instant sync. secure. easy to use and so on.
@_date: 2013-06-21 10:15:03
I've used coinabul. that's what I'd use again.
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:03:15
It cleared customs today!
So I hope it shows up on my door within a day or two.
@_date: 2013-05-11 09:15:27
I'm interested in this, I have not bought any of them yet, but It's on my to-do list.
Is there anyone here that can confirm a service for this that does work? which you have tested yourself?
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:45:46
I like the fact that itll be kickstarter. makes it easier for those who does not have a lot of btc to spend. I'm definitely going to back this project there.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:08:24
Depending on what you want to test - then there is the 'test network', which is for testing bitcoin while developing and so on.
You can also mine for bitcoin:
or provide a service which people pay for in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-18 10:17:04
post evidence of the report.
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:36:45
I did upgrade. it did not delay shipping. mine is on its way right now.
100 usd is easily earned back.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:32:09
good for you. wish I knew the feeling.
@_date: 2013-09-30 20:25:29
it works fine now. might be something earlier today.
thanks for sharing the info.
I run my own owncloud at my own home servers, but im always on the lookout for external storage. and this seems to fill that.
and its cool to see that you're a norwegian company (since im that myself).. :)
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:07:13
Please do believe so while I do my upgrade.
@_date: 2013-09-02 08:43:15
gpu mining is not profitable compared to asic. asic is the future.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:31:50
can easily be fixed. was more for debug at this point.
It'll all be explained and fixed in the article.
Currently writing it all down.
@_date: 2013-05-31 11:15:20
a dollar is a dollar, regardless of its value in other currencies.  a bitcoin is a bitcoin regardless of it's value in dollar.
to me this mbit an what not is just more of a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 08:39:59
I love electrum. best client imho. easy to use between many systems and no waiting for blockchain syncing. 
@_date: 2013-06-22 13:04:53
you do not need to spend thousands. it all depends on how much profit you want.
regardless - you need to look into getting a asic miner. figure out how much you want to spend, find a proper company and order.
I personally ordered from butterflylabs. 
keep in mind that deliverytime is long.
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:17:30
On their facebook group they say:
 That is because the Jalapeno used an older revision of the PCB board due to only using two chips. The new long boards needed to be improved to accommodate power consumption and we had to wait for them to arrive. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:41:28
Article covering this is now written:
hope you all like it and find it useful.
and like I mention in the article I'll continue to develop on this, and will make lot's of new features (one being it showing more 'screens' where it shows last transactions and so on, and swap between it every X seconds.).
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:53:47
I use these:
Very happy about price , speeds and features.
@_date: 2013-07-19 16:42:41
is this a joke? you honestly do not know who they are?  is it hard to google for 2 seconds?
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:54:48
space is infinitely big and always expanding, so I would not keep my hopes up.

I do not run bitcoind on raspberrypi. I connect to another machine from it that runs it. sorry if title / picture confused you with this.
ill write the guides after dinner now.
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:25:13
im very tired of all the bfl bashing. if you dislike them then just cancel your order and let the rest of us stand in line.
@_date: 2013-07-29 18:04:32
thanks for the info. perfect for me. have a 1 year old and we are planning on having our next baby.
@_date: 2013-07-23 13:05:03
I use this service to sell bitcoin to my paypal, 
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:55:16
(My first post here on reddit..)
First of all - THANK YOU for doing this.
I highly appreciate being able to buy good steam games for bitcoin. 
I just bought 'the cave' and 'euro truck simulator', everything worked out smooth.
The code arrived in less then 10 minutes.
Game time for 'Eve online' is something I'd appreciate.
Thanks again.
@_date: 2013-06-22 12:20:00
I had no issues to be honest.  I ordered last summer. ordered some gold.
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:14:42
time will tell.
I also ordered asic from bfl.
but as an engineer I do know that making projects always takes longer then expected. 
bfl has taken much longer time then what I thought they would, but im keeping my cool.
I ordered nothing more then what I was comfortable with loosing if it was a scam. but I do honestly think they will deliver. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:53:26
Now it's mining, and as you can see the upgrade is worth it!
photo's here:
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:04:32
the futuristic gui here is not what I'd want from a app like this. what I want is something in the lines of a regular bank app. nice and clean and to the point. this futuristic theme is utterly crap to be honest. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 08:09:03
link did not work for me.
nice to see a norwegian url.
Where are you based? what storage type do you use behind owncloud?
@_date: 2013-10-30 22:11:34
Thanks to this post my company now has a logo. Im very pleased with the work and speed of delivery.  I have no problem with paying for this, to me a company logo is very important. 
Im no graphical designer, and I had bitcoin on my account.  and id rather pay for this great work then wasting it on all the useless shit you can get for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:35:21
datacenters in mountain caves is not affected. its a reason why they build them there.
@_date: 2013-08-21 17:58:47
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:32:56
thats why I love using tor.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:22:25
I'll write a complete guide on how to do this, how to set up bitcoind, how to connect, all those steps, including code and links to lcd screen and so on. and upload to my website, then submit it to hackaday if they think it's worth it.﻿
@_date: 2013-05-13 12:40:44
Good luck.
If you want to start a casino, but come here and ask for advice, then I'm pretty sure you do not know what you are doing?
@_date: 2013-05-18 18:21:55
now this looks good. Definitely something im going to test and learn more about. 
thanks for sharing this.
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:30:55
congrats! what order number did you have?
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:58:24
This is exactly what bitcoin is for!
