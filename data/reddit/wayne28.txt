I would not say it's an attack. It is rather a combination of poor design choice (Immediately create a payment for each incoming transaction instead of somehow summarizing/combining payments) and abuse of the blockchain for telling a user that he has lost (the 0.000somthing1 transaction that you get if you loose).
I can see why the "you-lost"-message is there because it enables usage of the site without needing anything else than bitcoin client. But IMO the price for all other users is too high.
Probably interesting: [bitbattle.me]( - This seems like an alternative implementation with much reduced blockchain bloat.

Check out  They offer the same kind of bets but DON'T spam the blockchain. And you have personal bet addresses, personal stats and multiplayer mode. And no account required!

yep, nice and clean!

Well, I really think this site does not get the attention it deserves, probably because the creator doesnt do any advertising for it. Therefor i mention it here wherever it seems appropriate :-)
It is definitely not a scam, as you pointed out the bitcointalk link shows a lot of additional info.

So, this is a paid review? And the risk is 0/5? Other scores are fine, but personally I would give it 5/5 for risk as the service is new, I have no knowledge about the owner's history and it is probably breaking Amazon TOS.

They do a lot of things right. Zero delays, live coverage, personal stats, personal bet addresses. And most important no blockchain spam since there is no "loosing" transaction generated and all your bets are combined into a session!

Thanks for clarification.

Newb question here: Where can I use this card? As there is no card holder name it is for sure no replacement for my mastercard?
