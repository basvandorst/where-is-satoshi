this assumes loss remains roughly linear - I'm pretty sure people were more careless (Me) when it was worth 0.37 a btc, than now.
Fuck I wish I still had that wallet.dat.

You say that - but I thought I still had the file until recently. I don't know why so many people insist on that - lots of folks who got in early held for a very long time, The reason I lost is more that I kept the wrong folder than I wanted to get out early.
I figured it was either going to be a neat little story to tell my kids or I'd nope out at 10k.
It got to 10k, I looked in the folder, checked the documentation, found out I'd kept the wrong folder, got pissed at myself.
so... Check mate noob. 
Even mined most of them myself on an old AMD graphics card. Got some as a gift from another enthusiast on IRC, because some of us are old men here.

still, knowing I lost over 370,000 bucks out of carelessness is pretty fucking bad.

worse than losing password? Having your password, and losing your wallet.dat.

If you store the money, you can manipulate it - Remember MtGox?
That is how banking works - ESPECIALLY fractional reserve banking, and since BTC has a certain amount of democracy built into it, and there is a bit of proof of work/proof of stake involved in that voting - the banks would get way too much power in those fork choices.
Centralized storage kills anonymity, it kills the ability of the currency to remain free.
The wallets now are MUCH better than they were back when I started, and I've since gotten some more BTC, I have it in more sensible types of wallets, and am trying to find out if I can to a paper wallet backup (IS that an option with BTC? I like it with bytecoin)

there should not be a centralized storage mechanism. Period, that is antithetical to the point of the currency.
The biggest structural problem with the currency is it's vulnerability to centralization (Vulnerability to asics for example) 
I lost a lot of money by losing that file.
But I'd rather have lost that than have bitcoin work as a centralized currency. 
Bitcoin wouldn't be worth anything if it functioned like every other centralized currency (I mean, it does right now because the size of some of the voting blocks, but lets pretend alright?)

transactions will have to be faster first - or it'll have to find value somewhere else.

People need to be encouraged to save for their futures, and to spend for everyone else's future (economic growth requires flow of currency, ability to pay debts requires a stable or inflating currency)

Empiricism requires a control.

What is this guys track record though?

That seems like an awful lot of hot air to avoid admitting your rhetoric may have been too strong for your point.
I don't care about your Central point, simply the way you are saying it. I am not disagreeing with you, or detracting from what you are saying. Merely providing context, and pointing out that the manner in which you are putting forward your point may be hamstringing you with those who you might be trying to convince (are you actually trying to convince anyone? Or is this all an exercise in intellectual masturbation? The volume of this latest post leads me to believe the latter)

You used strong language to bolster your argument, seemingly hoping no one would call you on it.
Precision and accuracy would have been more convincing, and the splashiness of that tactic whether intentional, or due to pathos and haste does diminish the overall credibility of the whole of the post.
As to the rigor of social sciences, they do frequently make claims based on non repeatable research. Last metastudy I had read on economics publications, for example showed less than ten percent of studies to be reproducible. In a climate like that it is natural to question the scientific merits, or even the sanity of calling such a field a science. Isn't it?
