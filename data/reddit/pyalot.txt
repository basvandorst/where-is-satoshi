It's a strange "recovery" in which labor participation rate goes down, real wages decline and then stagnate for years, youth unemployment goes up, personal debt soars, high quality jobs get replaced by low quality jobs, interest is held at zero for a decade and the stock market has to be propped up by making bonds unattractive, peripheral economies drive into walls and a multitude of bubbles are inflated. A strange "recovery" indeed. One the likes we haven't seen, because it's not a recovery. We've been in a prolonged real recession since 2008 at the very least, although I'd argue it's a least since 2001 or even further. A 7 or 14 year recession is unheard of.

All the chinese exchanges are leading on this bull-run. One interpretation of this is that they're pulling other exchanges up. If it's real is another question entirely, since all chinese exchanges are shady as fuck and most provide zero fee trading, so whatever ticks they produce, they're worth less than squat. But who's gonna say no to a nice bull-run, even if it's a fake made in china one?

Things haven't been going good, for decades. You can stick your head in the sand or admit it, and you all but just admitted that.
QE was designed to suppress bond yields to scare people into equities, and it excelled magnificently at that, up until now. But QE can't go on forever (and we've so far met a brief hiatus) but that's only going to last as long as shit doesn't go down the drain again, which is about to do after the advertising pause.
It's fairly easy to see how scaring people into equities (and other investment) can easily produce miss-allocations of capital to enterprises that have no business existing in the first place. That's one of the things that structural reform means. Taking away the punch-bowl and shutting down the free party that allocates capital badly. You can't have a productive economy (and you do want a productive economy unless you're one of those dolists, like 50% of americans), if capital isn't used productively.

Considering that real wages have been stagnant for 20 years and the system's beginning to fray everywhere isn't exactly a qualified success. Keynesian policy and a debt based monetary system is not supposed to not let this kind of thing happen. We're not supposed to have repeated boom&amp;bust cycles like the ones we've seen in 2001 and 2008 and probably shortly again. Youth unemployment is rampant around the globe, and social unrest from economic hardship is popping up everywhere.




I didn't say the gold standard was a rousing success (of course it could only be an abject failure). I said gold was sound money. This is a fact that's been widely recognized whenever shit hit the fan in the last couple thousand years. And whenever people went and meddled with it, shit eventually hit the fan again (as when they dilluted gold coins and propped up the value of their currency with their military, like say the roman empire).


Name me any other monetary instrument that does not have counterparty risk, and which you can send trough an internet connection. Proof of stake ones aren't, that's been proven in abundance. Ripple isn't, because the entirety of ripple is based on massive counterparty risk (in every respect, IOUs, premined ripples, central control, gateways, etc.)
To give you a little historic perspective. Suppose you're a roman merchantman and you need to trade with somebody in Asia. Of course you can take a purse full of diluted roman coins that contain like 5% gold (or worse) and hope anybody over there, where your empire has zero reach will accept them. But the reality was, they didn't. Nobody in Asia wanted to get paid for valuable commodities with worthless chunks of metal. So what you did take over there to trade as a currency was gold. Why? Because irrespective of who ruled what where and who held what IOUs to whom, gold was always a scarce commodity and widely accepted as a form of payment. And what happened when the roman empire got out of business? Their currency was patently worthless once their empire collapsed. Their coins where ugly little corroded chunks of copper. So what did people do in the intervening years while there wasn't an empire to prop up a currency and your little fiefdom needed to trade both within and with your neighbors? You used gold, because no matter what stamp was on that gold coin, it was accepted currency.
You can paint the exact same story pretty much anytime there was a collapse and some form of worthless token was used as currency. Sometimes you can paint it even without any collapse, because everybody realized it was just worthless tokens. But whatever the cause, the outcome has been invariably, without fail, been that people reverted to sound money again. You can trace that straight back for thousands of years, trough every empire empire and kingdom that ever existed. Meddling with sound money is the favorite pastime of every king, emperor, dictator and politician. Reverting to sound money is what people do to make things work again when shit hits the fan (which it always does).

I think that things aren't going well, and governments are trying to fix it with fundamentalist Keynesian activities. I don't think it's working (as is amply evident around just about everywhere). In particular, the attempts to "fix" the problem have prevented structural reform, and so are directly responsible for creating the longest recession/depression in modern monetary history.


The gold standard couldn't work because it combined a scarce resource (gold) with money printing. Effectively an attempted "peg", that had to break. But using gold as money isn't the same thing as a gold standard. People have been using gold as money for the overwhelming majority of our monetary history without anything resembling a gold standard.
The world currently is obsessed with debt based monetary instruments that're backed by nothing whatsoever other than hot wind from politicans and whatever state resources they can't weasel out to commit to prop it up. This is a relatively young development, and it's very much an experiment. However it's by far not the first time that paper currency (or other worthless instruments) have been used. However history has always shown that they always fail to be replaced by sound money again. Always, think about that.


The sustained rate the network is capable of is 7tps. And it's true that this is not an ideal situation. However, that doesn't mean this is always going to be the case, and it doesn't detract from bitcoins role for less transaction intensive usecases (such as international settlement) even if that where all it could do.
Assuming the monetary system goes down the drain (which is a virtual certainty, the only disagreement is the timeframe), you can't use whatever money you used before anymore. You also can't use gold or silver, because you can't stick them into an ethernet connection, and if you could, they'd be encumbered by third party risk. So given that I expect a **lot** of pressure to come down on cryptocurrencies **when** (not if) the system fails, I'm quite confident that bitcoin  (or an alternative) will figure out a scalable transaction architecture that retains the original qualities.

It's also about systemic collapse. Everybody knows, proponents and opponents alike, that the way we run our monetary system and economy cannot work. Keynes knew it, every central bank knows, every investor knows it, every politician and even everybody on the street does.
The major disagreement isn't if you can stave off a weak economy with deficit spending and print your way to prosperity. The major disagreement is how long you can kick the can down the road before you **have** to endure drastic structural reform.
Just as everybody knows that our system can't work, everybody knows that when that system collapses, or hits a major bump in the road that'll make 2008 look harmless and we cannot rely on the system to work anymore, we will make do with whatever **is** working.
Historically we all know what will work. Sound money, will. And we know what sound money is, it's gold (or seashells, or what have you), anything that's not encumbered by default with third party risk. Something you can take upon your person and present it to somebody else. Something that needs neither a military, banking system or government to prop it up.
Whenever shit hit the fan in the past, sound money is what we reverted to. This has been going on for thousands of years. The only problem we have this time that we had the audacity invent a new world. A world in which things only go smoothly if you can transfer money trough a global network. And here is the problem, you cannot send sound money like gold without third party risk trough that network.
Bitcoin (and its derivatives) that rely on proof of work is the only form of sound money that can accommodate the world we built around us, and if shit hits the fan, it will be called upon to do exactly that.

Far more concerning than the subject of the block-size debate is that it shows that bitcoin has no structured way to change.
Software and protocols do need to change as time goes by, and sometimes those changes will have to be backwards incompatible. There seems to be no structured way to resolve the debate and no structured way to introduce changes.
I will propose one such way here: Introduce a feature voting system. Every client, full-node and miner expresses their agreement with a set of features in every transaction that is entered into the blockchain as well as every block that is mined. Come up with a rule/metric that determines when a feature will "activate" that's sufficiently disruption free (such as when 90% of miners and 90% of transactions over the past N blocks "agree" to that feature). I realize that the metric would be hotly contested, but at least it would be the last hotly contested issue that needed to be resolved "the hard way".
This would allow the consensual introduction of features and resolves any deadlock/debate automatically (by whomever can convince most participants in the network to agree to a feature).

That may be so. But at the same time we're clear steering for a dripple-dip recession/depression right now, so whatever they're doing, it's not working either, obviously, because what they're doing is supposed not to let that happen.
If we're given a choice between a double or tripple dip recession/depression whatever the means of that occuring, it's still preferable not to encumber the economy with an insane debt based monetary system and dubious policies that postpone much needed painful structural reform.

I'm pointing out that people like you come out of the woods **everytime** that drops manifest itself. Just like the "to the moon" guys come out of the woods **everytime** prices reach new all time highs.
Everybody's entitled to hold their opinions of course, but, there's a thing called "selection bias".
For instance, suppose when the price was at $1000 you created 2 reddit accounts. In one you where "to da moon $10'000" shilling, in the other you where "it's all going to $100" shilling.
At some or another point one or the other could be right. The longer back the prediction lies, the less power it holds. So let's suppose you create a range bunch of reddit accounts to cover a every conceivable timeframe and every conceivable sentiments.
Then you'd track, which reddit account goes well, and which doesn't, the ones who don't go well, you simply stop updating them, and you'll continue with the ones that hit the predictions.
You'd do this for a while, so you'd end up with some accounts that hit the right predictions simply because you covered all alternatives. So you can claim that you're the one true bitcoin prediction god.
What use would that be for you? Well, you could be milking karma. Or you could run some advisory business on the side where you get people to pay you to give them the next tip on price, etc.
Naturally, all your good tips would vanish once you run out of possibilities to cover from the preallocated accounts. But they wouldn't vanish before you haven't gotten whatever you wanted out of playing prediction god.
From an external perspective, your account (or any other that engages in predictions) would be indistinguishable from people just punting their opinion. But the reality underlying these, could be much more sinister.
So the responsible thing to do, is not to make predictions. Because, for people who thought about this, making predictions and publicizing them sheds a very poor light on the punter.

With a multisig "deposit" you can't perform exchange. In order for the bitcoins to change hands, you'd have to get the seller of bitcoins sign the transaction for the coins to go the buyers address.
But when somebody puts an order onto the market, you don't know when it will get filled/executed. However when it gets filled/executed, the seller now has to make the actual transfer or the trade is in limbo.
That means that you cannot free the fiat to go to the seller until he has signed the backlog of trades that he did (btw. you do still hold the fiat, because multisig fiat doesn't exist).
This poses some interesting problems. You're effectively matching "trades", without either fiat or bitcoins changing hands until the seller has followed trough in signing the trades. If the seller doesn't sign the trade, it means you've generated a "tick", from a trade that never came to be. It also means the buyer will be unhappy, though he might not have lost fiat, he'll insist on getting the coins at the price that the trade was filled.
For this reason, I don't think that's a viable way to run an exchange.

First of all, it doesn't matter if Newsweek believes if he is or not. Your right to publicity is a property right. You're not shielded from property right violation claims by your own lack of knowledge.
Secondly, assumed consent is not a explicit consent. For example, if you rape somebody, and then claim you thought they wanted sex, that doesn't mean you didn't rape somebody. It just means you're also stupid baggering belief. The same applies to consent given to a publication. If you don't have it explicitly, you simply don't have it. The onus isn't on the stalked to prove they're not who you say they are. That's not how it works.

The runup was from from a price of $440 and has peaked just shy of $600, with the current coins in circulation that moves the market cap of bitcoin up by $2 billion.
It's going on for 7 days, on a combined volume in currency across the three largest non chinese exchanges of around $160 million.
Currently you'll get around 400mh/$ (on top notch miners, if you can get your hands on em), which means that $160 million would buy you around 64ph/s. That's around 80% of what the total network hashrate currently is.

That's a different matter entirely. You can verify a gold bar of any size for purity. There are fortunate physical properties of gold that make this straightforward. First of all, in terms of density, it sits at an almost unique spot, only closely shared with few other elements (one of em being tungsten). However the magnetic properties of tungsten and gold differ considerably. If you've got time, an accurate scale, a volume meter and a magnetic apparatus to measure the magnetic properties, you can detect forgery.


I'm well aware of the gravity well issue. But it's not the only waste of fuel you'd find. If you've got plenty of time, you can get by with very little fuel once you're out of the gravity well. Time, however, is unlikely something you'd have plenty of. And earths gravity well isn't the only one there is. There's moons gravity well, suns, marses, jupiters, and so forth. There's the time you need to get your commodities there, which depresses the price they can fetch. If you can deliver on a shorter turnaround, on time, on demand, the commodities that somebody orders from you, from anywhere in the solar system, you're going to be able to command a hefty premium on the price of that commodity, compared to somebody who'll deliver "eventually".
Both modes of delivery have their justification, but just as in life, not everything can be planned 50 years in advance, so there will always be a demand for fast RTT delivery of commodities on wasteful trajectories spending much more fuel than economy trajectories would need.

The regulation you have to get under is KYC (know your customer), AML (anti-money laundering), BSA (bank secrecy act) and a host of others. They're encapsulated in two business descriptions, either a Bank or a money-transmitter. Keeping an exchange also requires you to get under a host of regulations of the SEC.
The bundle of licenses you'll have to aquire per state, and they go for around $500'000 - $1'500'000 per state.
It takes forever because you have to do each state individually, and you can't operate your business unless you've covered **all** states.
Technically following the regulations isn't that expensive (you need compliance officers dedicated to the job) but that just costs you salary and some IT cost.
But the capital required to get the license to be allowed to run your business, and the difficulties of obtaining the licenses is frankly insane.

If you want to make a bad trade, then putting a giant position into the market is exactly how you'll get the worst price you can get.
If you'd like to get a good price however, you'll parcel your position out across smaller sells and more time.
So almost everytime you see this happening, it's either a mistake, or somebody without a clue. The few times when it's neither, it's somebody who, for some reason, isn't concerned about the loss, and is content to pay a hefty premium to sell his position right now.

The "guarantee" that your futures contract holds, is worthless.
It's worthless for two reasons:
* If you actually try to follow trough with a claim on the contract, it's a ton of legal work. And it takes forever, especially, across country borders.
* There's no physical law that says somebody who sells you a future, actually has to be liquid in said future. It's certainly the intention that such arrangements are made, but there's no guarantee. By the time you get to actually claim the contract, whoever sold it to you is long gone into chapter 11 and you'll get anything from zip to very little out of it.

* Doge (like any altcoin) depends on Bitcoin. It depends on Bitcoin because bitcoin is the reserve currency that provides fungability to all of them.

They're actually a pretty good idea. Which would you prefer:
* A whole ecosystem of too big to fail goxes all tethering on the brink and goxxing everybody every few weeks?
* A gox that actually dies and goes away?
If you're all in for regulation and bail-outs, you're basically begging for the ecosystem populated by goxes. In the real world we call em Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, BofA etc.
No, the lesson you should learn is that you should be careful whom you give your assets. You should demand from the custodians of your wealth accountability and transparency. And if you have doubts about any of it, you should prepared to not trust those parties with your wealth. Instead, what most Gox users did was blindly trust their wealth to Gox and never check up on the custodianship in more than 2 years. There where ample signals that not all things where right. So this is the lesson, it's a lesson in self-responsibility. It's a lesson about Caveat Emptor. It's a lesson about what free markets are. It's an invaluable lesson, because, learning it, you go the first step away from being monetarily and financially illiterate. And frankly, you should be very glad you learned this lesson now, because, it's more than likely that you'll need it with the "traditional" financial system in the not too distant future.

Here's the [chart]( that tells you **everything** you need to know about the future of chinas monetary system.
After more than a decade of deflation of the CNY (Chinese Yuan Renminbi) vs USD, suddenly they reversed course. This year alone (3 months in) so far the CNY gave up 3.5% against the USD, more than it gained in the 12 months prior to 2014.
If you are Chinese, you are currently holding on for dear life to everything of value that's not an CNY. If China is hit by some severe economic crisis (like, oh, I don't know, every single one of them they've been breeding like their housing market) and they "just" returned to pre 2000 levels, you'd see inflation in china exceeding 50%/yr.

Naked short selling may have meant that somewhere in the past. But eversince it has come to mean a very different thing. It has come to mean that people would "sell" assets trough naked contracts without the intent of ever borrowing them, or even making sure they could borrow them at all. This has gone to lengths such as:
* Puts for stocks being entered into the system exceeding the total issued stock of a company
* Underwriting futures of commodities exceeding the stock at the broker, the stock of the nation, the total available stock on the globe.
Naked short selling has become the way that governments, hedge-funds and big corporations invent entirely fantasy "supply" of anything. You cannot have a market in which the supply is utter fantasy.

You continue to refuse to accept responsibility for your own behavior. Despite that the market just thought you a lesson in self-responsibility. Do honestly believe that any amount of regulation and nanny-government will be able to protect you from this?
There's things you need to know about your life. Chief among these things is to learn to accept the responsibility for your actions. And it's important to learn that, because if you don't, you will not reflect upon your actions and better yourself next time.
Today, it is Gox. Tomorrow it could be BofA. And the day after that it could be the USD. What are you going to do then? Blame somebody else? What's that actually achieve? Nothing. You will get nothing out of it.
I'm not saying regulation is bad. I'm saying that you can't expect regulation to protect yourself from your own stupidity. I too, learned this the hard way. And I owned up to my mistake. It sucks. Making mistakes hurts. It's supposed to hurt. If it wouldn't hurt, you wouldn't reflect on how to do better.

Of course there'll always be failures. But, there won't be a failure as big as MtGox anymore. Simply because they where the biggest (and only) exchange for a long while. A host of other exchanges went under (bitcoinica, tradehill etc.) but it wasn't **this** level of drama.
It's important that the exchange ecosystem is diverse and healthy. And if you buffer this, with some regulation or bailouts or whatever. It means that the unhealthy will linger on. It means that evolution can't take place and replace the sick and dying with fitter competitors.

The going rate is currently 0.05gox/btc, in other words, the market puts the chances of recovery somewhere around 1:20. At this rate, you'd expect there to be around 50'000btc that creditors can get out. I think that's vastly unrealistic.
I'm estimating that in the coming weeks as bankruptcy protection turns into outright bankruptcy and administration and more details emerge about the lost funds, that the rate will go towards 0.001gox/btc or thereabouts. In other words, it's probably going to slide towards 1:1000 or around 850btc for the total debt. It's likely that the price will stabilize there, as it's somewhat likely there's still a few thousand btc in gox that creditors can squeeze out.

There's two reasons banks (internally, or externally) aren't going to use a blockchain for their settlement.
The first reason is that in order to secure the blockchain, you need a community of miners. That's a tricky thing to do, and even bitcoin is struggling with it. It'd take a long time for the banks blockchain to reach proper diversification/maturity compared to bitcoins.
The second reason settlement on their own blockchain is problematic, is because in order to settle, the bank needs liquidity. Today banks settle in gold ETFs mainly. The reason they do that is because gold is relatively stable in relation to currencies/other commodities, and because it's extremely liquid (there's a large market for those ETFs where a bank can exchange some of those they got for something else). A banks blockchain would be very illiquid, and they'd have to build liquidity for a long time until they could use it for settlement. Bitcoin is way ahead on the curve on that, and while bitcoins liquidity isn't sufficient for bank settlement, it's not inconceivable that it'll get there eventually, and probably faster than the banks own blockchain would.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:42:37
There's so many things wrong with that idea, it's hard to even begin to explain them all.
** What if the keys are not lost**
The first thing that's wrong is that you **assume** that gox has lost their keys. What if they haven't? It actually doesn't look like Gox has lost their keys, it looks like they where scammed out of all their bitcoins over 3 years, without them noticing.
So, the network "correcting" for this, would lead to either of two outcomes.
* You'd identify who scammed bitcoin, and then revoke those coins from the network. That's a fungability attack, because, the scammers likely sold their coins into the market, sold to people who had no idea that they where buying gox stash. That's akin to blacklisting certain coins. You'd be taking them away from random people and give them to gox. That would fundamentally shake confidence in bitcoin to the core.
* You'd accept that the coins where stolen, but you decide to "credit" gox with 770k new coins out of thin air. That's a bail-out by a scarcity attack. This too, would shake confidence in bitcoin to the core.
** What if the keys where lost**
Let's assume, as you're inclined to do, that gox really "just" lost their private keys. The error in the argument that the network should correct for this is that it's a humongous moral hazard.
Let's say, the network would oblige your wish in this case. It would involve invalidating the funds on the blockchain that gox held, and crediting them with new funds. In order to do that, you'd have to have certainty that the coins claimed by gox, are actually in "control" of gox. Without the private keys, that's impossible to do securely. So, it would come down to a trust decision, they say they lost them, and miners would have to take them by their word.
This opens a whole can of worms. It means that if Gox can do that, anybody can go crying to the community "I lost my keys, please help me." It means that it would be done countless of times in the future. But, this poses a problem. How do all these people in the future prove that they are the former holders of the key? They can't. It's pure trust. So anybody could steal the coins of any address, if he just manages to crybaby convincingly enough. This too, would shake confidence of bitcoin to the core.
** Regardless of what happend, you can't convince the majority**
In order for any harebrained scheme like this to succeed, you'd have to convince at least 50% of miners, to go along with it. There's no chance in hell, that you would get miners to attack bitcoins guarantees on fungability, scarcity and security from theft, when their main business relies on Bitcoin being worth anything. You'd essentially be asking them to kill themselves. That's simply not gonna happen.
** Even if you succeed, you fail**
But, even if you could implement any harebrained sceme AND convince miners to go along with it, you effectively have just destroyed Bitcoin. You attempted to rescue 770kbtc. What you did is, you obliterated 12mbtc in circulation and any 9mbtc to come. You may have "rescued" those 770kbtc, but they're now worth zip, zilch, nada, nix, nil anymore.
** Even if you destroy bitcoin, you'd just end up with two separate bitcoins**
Let's entertain the theory you could destroy bitcoin and convince 50% of miners to go along with the scheme. What'll the others do? You'd be looking at a blockchain and client fork. You'd now have two blockchains, the one that dispenses worthless unlimited tokens. And the other that operates by the old rules. You'd have Bitcoin 1.0 (aka the one and only) and Bitcoin 2.0 (aka the bailout and unlimited coins coin). Bitcoin 1.0 would chug along as it always has done. But Bitcoin 2.0 would rapidly decline in value to near zero. Your Bitcoin 2.0 coins would be worthless on the Bitcoin 1.0 chain, and the exchange rate would be so unfavorable as to make it ridiculous to even try to exchange them. In the end, you might end up with more than 50% of the miners temporarily, until they realize they're not making any profit and switch to Bitcoin 1.0.
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:53:43
The daring experiment that bitcoin is, isn't just a technology for keeping a shared ledger. It's inextricably also an attempt to arrive at an expression of value without any commodity backing.
These things go together, they can't be separated. If you had to back a a shared ledger by a centralized authority on a commodity issuing IOUs, then it couldn't work. You couldn't entice miners to keep the network ticking, you couldn't get people aboard trying to find a value, and you couldn't keep it secure from issues that typically arise with central authorities (defaults, shutdowns, fraud, infinite issuance, etc.)
So it doesn't matter if you stand to gain, or miss out to gain, what matters is that there's no other way of doing it.

* Why is that we need to be bailout with taxpayer money?
* Do we really need to give our executives record bonuses when we've done the most miserable year, in a row?
* How come it costs our clients so much to move money to other people?
* Why does it take days, weeks or months to complete payments?
* How come we're the only IT-service that's closing up shop on weekends and official holidays?
* Why aren't any of our official competitors any better?
* Why have we screwed up 2008 so badly?
* Are we our own worst enemy?

If you're not willing to bid a premium at an auction, you're retarded to begin with. That was completely perfectly forseeable.
There are perfectly good reasons to buy at a premium at an auction whose price isn't immediately moving the market price, such as that the premium you end up paying is lower than what you'd have paid on the open market.
And I hold that those who went with the second market syndicate, if they all turned around and bought on the open market, it'd have driven the price up substantially. And, in fact, the price did rise substantially, around 10% since friday, so I'd say, at least a bunch of those who where bidding on the coins, did exactly that, they bought on the open market, and drove the price up.
That's what happened. The reality. The auction commanded a premium. That's a fact. The auction awarded the coins to a single bidder. That's a fact. Second market didn't get any coins. That's a fact. Arguing shoulda coulda woulda doesn't change it post-hoc. The second market syndicate bids where too low, because they where unwilling to spend above market value, and now they don't got any coins, and they're spending 10% over market value now to get them anyway. That's a fact, too.

The problem is that china has bolstered their GDP bottom line by up to 50% with speculative bubbles in housing/infrastructure that is now not used. At the height of the US housing bubble, 15% of the US GDP was tied in that kind of speculation. China has been riding their bubble now for nearly half a decade. They have got whole copies of central Paris, Manhattan etc. all over the country, and they're still being constructed, with occupancy rates in the 1% range years after being "finished".
The situation is quite dire. It may be that the Chinese intend to stop the CNY inflation (like they did before), but they're also in a clinch. If they stop the appreciation of the USD to the CNY, their export business craters and their economy slows (seeing as china is still mainly export oriented). At the same time, the US has produced vastly more USD since 2008, than China has produced CNY. This means there's pressure on the CNY to appreciate over the USD. Add to that, that China is a major holder of USD bonds, which they can't sell, least they want the CNY to appreciate, which is the last thing they want right now.
It's another of these macroeconomic russian roulette games. The can't have the CNY appreciate because that'd slow down their economy and pop all their bubbles. On the other hand, they could just keep inflating the CNY and shift the cost of that "economic policy" onto everyman. It's been repeatedly clear that China puts the nations image and economy before its people. So, I'm not sure if they're gonna pop their current inflation, like they did before. Time will tell, and not a lot of time in 2 quarters to a year, you'll know.

Forget everything guy said in the analysis and look at it from a BofA PR perspective.
* If they predicted $10/btc or null/btc they'd be in the press for being bitcoin hostile and that could have a PR backlash in the form of "haha, BofA is so conservative/backwards"
* If they predicted $10k/btc they'd be in the press for being bitcoin enthusiasts, something else they'd probably not want to be too closely associated with.
So their prediction has to fall somewhere between $10 and $10k. Why not pick something that's reasonably close, so that when:
* It fails to live up to that, they can say, well, they did a reasonable guess
* It goes beyond it, they can say, well, we predicted it'll be higher

What's the meaning of a transaction that everybody agrees to be valid, whose script has only been partially been executed? It doesn't mean anything anymore, it's ad-absurdum. You're opening yourself up to all kinds of fraud. How about that multisig script that you only execute to the first signature and then enter it into the blockchain. Hurray... NAAAAT.

Yeah, sorry to break this to you, but, bitcoin isn't a way to evade taxes.
So how's the IRS gonna track it down? Pretty simple.
1) Somebody gives you bitcoin, you give them a receipt, they might file that receipt with their taxes (business expenses, that kind of thing). So, they'll look at the receipts, and tally up the movement of money, and lo and behold, some side isn't declaring it, say helluuuu to the friendly IRS auditors.
2) You got some bitcoin, and you exchange them for fiat. So, the person who gave fiat (maybe an exchange, maybe localbitcoins, whatever) may file their exchange with the IRS. Same story as above, IRS goes looking for the money trail, and yours doesn't show up in the tax declaration. You really like those IRS auditors don't you?
3) You're using bitcoin like most people, and it's not very anonymous. So the IRS just goes looking trough the blockchain, and put as many labels on addresses as they can, so they're gonna knows pretty precisely how many bitcoin you received and when that was from whom. If the blockchain doesn't agree with your tax declaration, uh heluuu IRS auditor.
4) If you're suddenly in possession of something (a house, car, whatever), that you didn't have before, you'll have to document how that came to be yours. Is it a gift? Estate tax. Is it bought from proceeds you didn't declare? Well, what where these proceeds, and so forth.
So FFS, please don't do that, unless, you terribly love getting audited, I mean, who doesn't right?

Bitcoin is based on proof of work. Proof of work makes extremely strong majority safety guarantees for transactions.
Proof of stake is not secure, in any fashion or color, the way that proof of work is.
Having a stake does not equate to being trustworthy in signing off transactions. It has two main flaws:
* Spam
* An attack can be more profitable than the stake

No, you don't have to scan the rest of the blockchain to figure out if an address was spent. You query from the network the last spend from that address on the longest chain, and tally up inputs since that spend.
You need *somebody* with the blockchain so you can ask for the last spend for an address and for subsequent inputs. What matters is what more than 50% of miners have as the last spend of that address and what inputs they have **after** that spend, not what **your** copy of the blockchain says.
Regardless, you'r insinuating that thin wallets don't work. Contrary to the reality, that they **do** work. How do you explain that? Magnetism?

P2Pool isn't a pool in the sense you understand pools (and don't confuse it with p2pool dot org, which is basically just domain squatting).
P2Pool is a software, that is a peer 2 peer network and its own blockchain, that implements a protocol for publishing "proof of share", based on a lower difficulty per block, and then people collaborate decentrally to find a bitcoin block, and if they do, credit everybody else who's proven to have done work in the coinbase of the block they found.
P2Pool isn't a pool. It's a way for miners to perform proof of share, and to keep finders of blocks honest in crediting hashing share holders of each round.

The current hashrate is at around 33ph/s. It's going up at a rate of about 100'000%/year, around 80%/month.
The very high end of mining hardware is at around 660mh/s/$, the more available hardware is at around 80mh/s/$.
That means that if you where to exclusively build the network from this hardware, the network is worth anything between  to $50m - $412m. 
A month from now that capital requirement will have grown to $90m - $741m, in two months $162m - $1.3b, in 6 months $1.7b - $14b, in a year $57b - $476b, in 2 years $66t - $550t.
Yes, it's somewhat feasible at the moment, if you had the hardware, right now, to execute a 50% attack on the network. This window will close however rapidly and will be completely closed within 24 months.
It's not so much that it's just damn expensive currently to execute a 50% attack, it's also that the ability to execute the attack rapidly runs away from you practically every second you haven't done it already.

The usual bitcoin transaction is:
* An input
* An output to the destination
* An output to the change address
* Leftover is miner fees
In order for a transaction to be valid, the destination+change outputs have to be smaller or equal to the balance of the input.
That means even if you're sending the change back to the same address, the last spending transaction from an address, still defines/verifies the amount held in that address because that's the change amount.
As to querying the network for pieces of the blockchain, that's a completely legit and good way of doing things. Miners and full relays have to keep the blockchain around to query it. They can't operate without that. Miners are also the arbiters of consensus on transactions, so it doesn't actually matter what **your** copy of the blockchain says. What matters is what 50% of everybody elses blockchain says.
In the end, even if you have your own blockchain copy around, you'll only add blocks to it from the longest branch, which is what everybody else agrees on to add to. You don't even need to actively filter out forks, they usually die all by themselves as nobody wastes resources to mine on forks for very long.

@_date: 2014-01-17 10:03:29
Yeah that crashing thing, that's not working for a pretty simple reason.
Suppose they get rid of their 144'000 coins quickly. It doesn't matter if they disclose the price or not, the markets will learn the price simply by whoever gets the coins selling them on until the price is below what they paid.
So let's say, they're gonna sell the coins at 1/10th the market price right? So there's gonna selling pressure down towards say $100 in the volume of 144'000 coins.
Now, bitcoin exchanges do about 89kbtc of volume/day. Let's say about 20% of that is driven by genuine desire to buy (rather than just swing trading). That means you've got about 17kbtc of bitcoin demand/day.
However, this demand is at the current price level. If the price goes say from $900 to $450, the bitcoin volume demand doubles (people have twice the funds to buy).
So, assuming that $100 or so bottom, how much actual bitcoin demand can there be on the way down? Let's say the movement is about equally spaced from $900 to $100 down. Let's assume those 17k in demand. Let's divide that in some meaningfully fine unit, like say $1 steps. And let's divide the demand by the steps (obviously demand can only be expended once). And now we're interested in how many days we have to pile up to consume a 144kbtc selloff.
If you run that, you'll get that on the way down, it'll take 3-4 days until demand outstrips supply.
So the important question is what happens after?
Bitcoin's demonstrated that if nothing else, it's capable of massive volatility, so it going right back up to $900 has a certain likelyhood. There'll also be plenty of spooked people panic selling, but, the more they panic sell, the larger the purchasing power of the bitlievers gets (no matter if they're right or not).
At some point, there simply are all the coins the fed has sold, sold, and all the panic sellers sold, but the bitlievers keep munching cheap coins at the bottom and don't put them back on the market.
What happens? Price rises rapidly. Commence next bubble.

Bitcoin is divisible, it's secure from counterfeiting and it's guaranteed to be scarce. These properties are there, because of the characteristic of bitcoin. It's an inherent property of bitcoin to be like that.
The real difference between gold and bitcoin is, that gold guarantees these properties trough physics, while bitcoin guarantees them trough mathematics. While the mathematical guarantees might not be quite as strong as the laws of physics, they do have other advantages, the biggest of which is that you can send mathematics trough the internet, but you can't do that with gold.

Finance industrial complex.
In theory government and private business is separated in these "silos":
* Legislative: passes laws
* Judicative: implements the laws
* Executive: enforces the laws
* The public: follows the laws
The idea being that the separation of power prevents (some) abuse and corruption, and therefore there's laws that regulate in which fashion the actors in these silos may interact with other silos (anti-corruption laws and so forth), i.e. there's a kind of "firewall" between them.
In practice what happens is that persons and institutions with enough power (money) are able to pierce these "firewalls" with various instruments (such as family ties, business ties, relationships, lobbying, campaign financing, bribery, blackmail, etc.)
So legislative, judicative and executive are basically just subunits of the Finance industrial complex. They are not serving the public, voters or constituents, they are serving their corporate masters.

I've come to the conclusion that the phrase "it's like chinese" really applies to everybody, even the chinese. I've got little doubt that of the numerous chinese people trying to do translations of some chinese drivel to english, a lot of them are excellent in english. But somehow, what they translate usually doesn't make any kind of sense. Given that this is a persistent phenomenon, this suggests that the problem is neither english, nor the translators, but rather the origin language itself. Chinese seems to be basically unintelligbly vague and ambigous so as to render attempts at comprehension (let alone translation) entirely futile, even for native chinese.

There's some substantial uncertainty as well as to the stewardship of fiat currencies. Economists will have us believe that governments can print 100'es of %/year in money, yet that we can remain at a 2% inflation or so.
In support of that point they often simply state that, well, hyperinflation hasn't happened yet, so clearly the quantity theory of money doesn't apply, so there.
Since 2008 the average **annual** expansion of base money was:
* US: 54% (to total 370%)
* EU: 24% (to total 220%)
* Switzerland: 180% (to total 1000%)
* Japan: 20% (to total 200%)
* China: 10% (to total 150%)
This trend is unprecedented. There is simply nothing to compare it to. Recorded monetary policy of these countries since they started using their current incarnation of currency has never seen a period where any single one would've increased their monetary base by that amount year over year, let alone, all at the same time.
If the past 5 years would have been a period of extraordinary economic growth, these numbers could at least be justified. But the fact is, the economy did not grow in that time, it drastically contracted. And it's true that inflation was extraordinarily low in the last 5 years, and that central banks had to react to the deflationary pressure from faltering markets.
But the bill for this extravagance of money printing **is** going to be due should our economy ever recover, and money velocity accelerate, which is to be expected.

There's some truths and some untruths in that article, and reading trough the comments, a lot of misconceptions.
I am swiss, born and raised.
First of all the "swiss deflation" story is false. Yes it may be shown by the numbers the government releases, and inflation is probably lower than in other countries. But we definitely do not have deflation. Any good you buy on a daily basis is rising in price, noticably. For example:
* meat prices go up all the time, it used to be you could buy a decent steak for 5chf a couple years ago, now you pay 10chf.
* Packaging sizes are going down. Packs of butter keep getting smaller, price stays the same.
* Tabaco prices are going up
* Gas prices are going up.
* Rent costs you more every year. Specifically, I happen to know this, because an apartment I rent, which is identical to the one a friend of mine rented, was put back on the market for 20% more than what I still pay for it. And it's still on the rise.
* Doing my regular grocery run, I used to pay something like 40chf for my basket a few years back. Now it's closer to 60chf.
Secondly, it's not true that we have low taxes (at least not universally):
* You pay 25% income tax, flat. There's deductions, but you'll hit that rate pretty soon.
* Added value tax (VAT) is 8%
* Compulsory pension is 12%
If you add these up, you come out at something closer to a 45% rate. We are in the top tax bracket of the world, way ahead even of many central european countries.
But it went just went down, didn't it? Nope. A couple of years ago they abolished progressive tax, which was capped at 25%, and replaced it with a flat tax rate of 25%. In actual fact, the last 3 years saw an expansion of tax by around 30%.
This wouldn't be that bad, if stuff was cheap, but it isn't.
* Single person health insurance per year is $7000
* A 30sqm flat costs you CHF 1000/year. A 100sqm family flat goes for CHF 2800/year. Of course the price varies, but that is a typical price at a not too remote, but not too exclusive location.
* Buying a house, any house, will easily run you into hundreds of thousands (a dinky house) or millions of dollars (something decent). There's no such thing as cheap housing here.
* Breakfast will set you back by $20 easily. Sure you can scrounge by, but do you really want to?
A living, single person income in this country used to be something like CHF 30'000 around 10 years ago. Now it's around CHF 60'000.
But our economy's not built on a bubble, right? We don't do some crazy QE or whatever? WRONG!
The SNB (swiss national bank) expanded the swiss monetary base from [CHF 40 billion in 2008 to nearly 400 billion in 2013]( We're the **masters** of QE. No other country in the world had the audacity to do 1000% of QE. What did they do with the money? Why don't we have crazy inflation? The SNB bought large positions of euros with that newly printed money at national banks. In turn, the national banks made a handy profit on that trade, because the SNB was buying the euro up, and the national banks could pocket the profit. This has two consequences:
* The SNB is the largest holder of euros in existence. It owns 25% of the monetary base of the euro on its balance sheet. Think about that.
* The currency in actual circulation only rose from CHF 40 billion to CHF 60 billion between 2008 and 2013.
* The balance sheets of national banks have jumped from 5 billion CHF in 2008 to 320 billion CHF in 2013.
So whaddaya know, they straight up gave all that money directly to banks.
Now to dispell some of the comments here. Switzerland isn't a homogenous country. One wouldn't need to point out the huge cultural differences of the different language regions, or the close to 30% foreigner rate. No, I'll explain this quite simply: Basel around the turn of last century had a workers revolt. The Basel military refused to shoot at the workers. That's why the swiss government pulled in the Zürich militia, and had them shoot the Basel workers, which they did. You can say that was a long time ago, but, in 1970ish there was a large protest at a nuclear plant near Basel. The government considered (but did not act) on the idea to have the Zürich military restore order there...
That's how "non homogenous" we are. One Canton's willing, to this day, to outright shoot the population of another. We're a quarrelsome lot. Did you know that back in the 70ties, our capital was bombed? You know why? Because swiss separatists felt violated because Berne stole their holy stone, in 1600ish or so... (they returned it, 2000ish or something I think).
Do swiss typically have a lot of savings? Not as far as I know. Of all the people I know (family and friends, admittedly, it's not a big circle, I'm a nerd), there isn't much saving. There might not be a lot of debt, but that's not quite the same as a lot of saving.
But we're safe from bail-ins right? NOPE and NOPED the fuck out. Bail-in laws have been silently introduced a couple of years back, nobody seemed to give a flying fuck.

Err wut? Krapapples being subponead is somehow bad for bitcoin? Really? Have they even looked at the market reaction? Nooooo of course not.

Yeah in case you haven't noticed, that little thing that happened 2008, it's now called the great recession, and it was the worst economic calamity to happen since the great depression. So sure, things are getting better, what what, better!


That's pretty much how everybody uses gold, and, that's how a lot of people use bitcoin too. Sure, it might gain, that's cool, but, reason you really hold is because, when shit really hits the fan, well, maybe you can still use it, or gold, or whatever isn't a paper asset.


Surely you're aware that the entire recent history prior to 1971, which includes putting a man on the moon, fighting two world wars, the industrial revolution, and so forth was pretty much done with gold backed currencies.
And surely, you're aware that since 1980 or so, thing haven't been going very well in the department of prosperity in the western world. Thing's pretty depressing to look at. The baby boomers are retiring from the workforce, by far and large, they're setup pretty good. Their kids and the X generation, well, their labour participation rate is lower, their net worth is lower than their parents, less of them have pension that're worth anything. And then you get to the Y generation, and they're poorer than **their** parents, they've got even less jobs, let alone their own house or apartment. For most of them, pensions is something they'll never have. So are things finally getting better, since 2008? Well no, the jobs that where lost, where a lot of middle class jobs. The jobs (such as there are) that replace them are low wage jobs. And the the jobs are held, disproportionately by older generations, while the brunt of the joblessness is borne by the Y generation.
So yeah, things are going great right? For decades one generation comes out poorer than the next, the middle class is a dying breed, society suffers from elite overproduction and subsequent political dysfunctionality as well as that economic inequality is climbing to ever greater heights every year.
So no, things aren't great and they're getting worse. And there's no end in sight, we're long past peak oil, that came and went and nobody noticed. 2020 to 2030, that's gonna the oil shock. And it's gonna get ugly. And that's not all, climate change is worsening, and that'll have huge economic impacts, it already has.
You know, I'm not a pessimist, I think it's great, it'll force us to change our ways. To develop sustainable economic and environmental policies and act on them.
But the age of financial stability, of cheap energy, of oil, of centrally banked fiat, this is the end of the line for em.
So no, bitcoin isn't an attack on central banking. I mean, that's ridiculous. The only thing that'll do central banking in, is central banking itself. Bitcoin is merely insurance for when that happens. And if it doesn't happen, well, not many people gonna be unhappy that Armageddon didn't happen.

Yeah, really, you want to go down this line of argument?
In the last 9 months, litecoin difficulty went up 35000%. It only needs to go up 400% to render your argument invalid, at any time, because litecoin only does 4x as many blocks over time than bitcoin.
And if litecoin really takes off, and I mean, you know, the bitcoin kind of takeoff, then you're looking at diff increases of 30% every diff adjust, that's gonna give litecoin exactly the same problem. Having 4x more blocks at that stage, just delays the very same problem, with the same popularity ramp length by a mere 3 months.
So do you really want to go and claim, that because litecoin is less popular, but will hit the very same bumps on the road as bitcoin in some eventual future, but when it does, it'll hit them 3 months later than bitcoin on the same leadup, that, therefore litecoin is better? Really?

Except that you can't label a prediction market or spread betting site an exchange. Especially, you can't pretend to have inventory while you have none. That's what naked short selling is. Pretending to exchange inventory.
If you clearly label that you're not an exchange, and that no inventory is involved, that's fine. What's not fine, for instance, is what goes on in gold "markets". Frequently there are contracts dumped into them, that exceed any conceivable inventory, only to be taken off again shortly after.
How would you feel if some Wall Street exchange would have an "orderbook" to sell 2 billion bitcoins?

It does change a lot of things in how you label things. If you dump contracts to sell actual inventory into the market, markets do what markets do, they'll react to the apparent appearance of supply. But if there's no actual supply...
The willingness to bet against something, isn't the same as the act to actually sell something. You can bet all day long, that doesn't affect anything. But if you provide supply, it's supposed that the supply goes somewhere.

Translation: The RUB/EUR and RUB/USD exchange rates are plummeting. This means that people have begun fleeing the RUB. That does not imply they're exclusively fleeing into the USD.
So where are they fleeing to?
* Gold is up 1.8% in the last 12 hours
* Silver is up 1.6% in the last 12 hours
* USD/RUB is up 1.6% over the weekend
* EUR/RUB is up 1.2% over the weekend
* CHF/RUB is up 1.4% over the weekend
* EUR/USD is down 0.14% over the weekend
* CHF/USD is flat over the weekend
* NASDAQ is down 0.25%
* DOW is up 0.22%
* S&amp;P is up 0.33%
* USD/BTC (stamp) is up 4% in the last 24 hours.
* Crude OIL is up 0.25%
* Natural Gas is up 1.5% over the weekend
Seems like pretty much everything is up except RUB and NASDAQ. I.e. they're fleeing into everything but stocks, oil and RUB.

I have waited so long for the day to arrive, and though it sucks for the price at the moment (hey, it's buying time), I am so glad we got Gox out of the system now.
Just imagine how it'd have been if they had managed to limp on for years, always casting this doubt, always tethering on the brink, being goxxed every few weeks.
A big company failed, and went under, because they where raging incompetent and crooks. Their customers got hurt. And that's how it should be. The market will absorb this shock in the coming weeks, unbuffered, unfiltered, without some central bank bailing out the too big to fail. And after it is trough, the true recovery can begin.

Sure, but what I mean with that is that a lot of bitcoin is built on probabilities, game-theory, number-theory and so forth. It's probabilities that govern how likely a hash is going to be broken, how likely a 50% attack is and so forth.
The probability of an atom of gold being fake, is much lower than the probability of there being a collision to an elliptic curve hash. Both probabilities are astronomically unlikely though, as to make the difference nearly moot.
Anyways, sure the scarcity of gold on earth is governed by the abundance of gold we can economically reach. So It's possible we might reach gold out in space cheaper, but, I don't think that's gonna play a major role. You see, the value of gold on earth is what, some $1300/ounce. What's the value of raw materials you can use to produce fuel, spacecraft and electronics in space? I'm guessing a lot more than $1300/ounce.
You might doubt this, but think about it. Let's just concentrate on hydrogen and oxygen, i.e. fuel. Let's say you want to fly somewhere in the solar system, you'll need fuel. To get gallon of fuel into earth orbit, you'll need to spend around 50 gallons of fuel. To get to moon orbit, you'll need to spend around 100 gallons. To get to mars orbit, around 1000 gallons. So by the time you get fuel to mars, the price of that commodity comes at markup, you'll also need to include the cost of the launch/transport vehicle etc. so a markup of around 2000:1
At a markup on mars of 2000:1 for a gallon of fuel (in terms of gasoline , that'd mean around $8000/gallon). But rocket fuel is more expensive by a factor of about 10x, so you're looking at a price of around $80'000/gallon. That's around $625/oz. And we're just talking a basic commodity here. Now think what it'll mean in terms of other commodities like titanium, hydrocarbons etc.

That's not naked short selling. That's a futures contract, there's a difference. Naked short selling is when an exchange pretends that X tons of oil/corn have actually been sold, right now, but there is no oil/corn to be had, neither now, nor in 6 months. Naked short selling is pretending to have "stock" when you don't, but acting like it was a regular trade, and not some kind of future with zero chance of delivering.

You see, I believe that intelligence can provide an answer to much of the problems we have. Both personal intelligence, and institutional intelligence. This intelligence would usually take the form of you using it, yourself. The second form would be expecting of the custodians of your wealth to be accountable, and pressing them to implement procedures to ensure accountability.
But because you're fucking dumb, you can't conceive that as a solution. For you, the only solution is regulation. Let me tell you a secret about regulation. Regulation is made by the government. Do you know how fast governments can adjust to a fast changing environment? Yes, the answer is, not at all.
So if you get to the point, where the only solution is regulation, you've basically failed. Because, that's the worst solution you can come up with. How the hell do you think 2008 happened? The financial sector is the most heavily regulated industry there is. Wanna know how it happened?

Nothing has prevented the marketcap to fall due to external shocks since it started to be traded, yet, it shows a remarkable trend.
Extrapolations are estimations, just that, estimations. The only way to extrapolate is to look at the past, since you cannot look at the future.
The XKCD joke uses two slights of hand:
* It ridicules extrapolation based on an extremely shallow sample base (1)
* It ridicules extrapolation based on an extremely unlikely continuation (marriages)
Effective estimation rests on two main pillars:
* Uses a rich sample base (many many sample points)
* Is applied to data where the estimation into the forseeable future is not obviously impossible or ridiculous.
Bitcoin price estimation somewhat fulfills both these criteria:
* The bitcoin market capitalization rests on pricing market data, which is available in abundance from a variety of sources, so the sample basis is fairly good, and it's getting better as more exchanges chip in.
* The price is never, by definition, ridiculous or impossible. It's just what people agree to exchange.

That's not how it works. You don't need to scan the whole blockchain to figure out an address balance, that'd be insane, and nobody does that. There's been a couple of on-top-coins and altcoins that seem to think that's a smart idea, but that's not how bitcoin and derivatives do it.
Every transaction involves a destination address and a change address. I.e. everytime you make a transaction, the input address is completely drained. This makes the problem vastly much simpler. To figure out the balance remaining in an address, you just need to find the most recent spend on the longest blockchain branch.
The bitcoin P2P protocol allows you to query transactions out of blocks. It also allows you (with the merkel root) to discover the longest chain. And it allows you to query which blocks contain transactions for an address on which chain.
If an address has never spent, all you need to look at are the inputs to that address, which again, you can query from the network.
That's how Multibit and other thin wallets work. And not only do they not need to query the entire blockchain, they can update the balance from all transactions that have been going on since they last looked at an address, and they do this in mere seconds, minutes at the outset for months of transactions.

Yeah I know, but the fix depends on miners picking it up, and they mainly report these obstacles:
* What is this I don't even documentation?
* Usability of this program is shit
* Need to d/l the whole blockchain so it works
So while some of that stuff is going to get better, that doesn't guarantee you can convince the large miners to move over (nobody cares about the usb stick and jalapeno crowd really).
Meanwhile the large pools will probably continue to amass hashrate share until they're both gonna account for nearly 100% of the hashrate with a bit less than 50% each.

If you can take delivery (i.e. withdraw) and deposit easily, it's extremely likely that it's real.
The reason is that, if an exchange didn't back its trades with bitcoins, but allowed people to withdraw, it would run the risk of a bank run. People would be able to claim more coins than the exchange has.
An "exchange" that was run intentionally as a betting site won't allow you to take delivery, or will make it as hard as possible.

A 51% attack would require a) the necessary hardware to perform it and b) it would require a malicious action (such as say, crediting yourself vast amounts of coins).
No miner will accept a block that's been such fabricated, and no client will accept it either. So effectively you'd have a blockchain fork (these happen all the time, non maliciously).
In a fork, you have to decide which block you base your next block on. If there are two options, an invalid one, and a valid one, you base your next block on the valid one.
Performing a 51% attack is a very vain endevour indeed, because whatever malicious action you take, is not recognized by anybody else.

You can see that there's problems with the idea that quantity is virtual and supply/demand is only limited by how much two parties are willing to bet, right?
Real supply and real demand is how a commodity market figures out what price to put onto a commodity. That in turn matters to those who produce and consume said commodity.
If you're dumping a ton of contracts onto a commodity market that you're never intending to deliver, you're driving the price of the commodity down and make it infeasible for the producers of the commodity to keep producing. That's bad because it basically destroys the business underlying the commodity, and it creates a situation in which your Wall Street slot machine spits out prices that are completely disconnected from any reality. This in turn drives actual commodity trading to alternative venues where the prices transacted are still connected to reality.
The Wall Street naked short theory of quantity is bullshit, and if you believe that's a sustainable way to run a market, you're severely deluded.

Maybe I went a little fast there, and you didn't follow trough on the thought, so I'll have to explain it more slowly perhaps.
Price history, fundamentals, news, etc. is information. All information that exists, that is known by people who buy and sell, has some impact on the current price. There is no information that is inherently less worthy of attention, than any other.
A prediction is something that attempts to speculate about the development of the price in the future. Since the future has not happened yet, this speculation has to be based on past information. There is no other information than past one. All you are, know and think, is based on what happened before that point in time.
You stipulate that:


This statement applies to any continuation of a trend, as well as to any discontinuation of a trend, or any other movement in any way, based on past information. It is in fact, itself a prediction after a fashion. It's a prediction of the likelyhood on the inferrability of the future based on information (which always means past information).
Therefore, the argument you make does not only apply to price history, it equally applies to news, fundamentals or any other kind of information, from which you might derive any kind of prediction of the future price. It even applies to itself recursively and in multiple ways. Recursively because it is itself a prediction of the future, and because as you make it information that determines price, it becomes part of the history of price influence and so it applies to itself.
It follows that a statment that recursively references and applies to itself, which modifies the nature of the thing it purports to make a statement about and which is therefore internally contradictionary is not a very good utterance. It is in fact, an empty phrase. It's devoid of any concrete meaning.
Nevertheless, this phrase is uttered around these parts many a time, and so it follows that to properly categorize this statement, having proven that it's void of meaning, it must be something else than a statement. Fortunately just such a category for self-perpetuating void statement exists, they're called a "meme". They're something that people infect themselves with and which lodges in their brain, and they become carriers which then spread it further, often without thinking or checking what they're actually helping to spread.
Congratulations on having made it down here and it was my pleasure to give you an education in philosophy.

You'll be disappointed to learn that:
* The protocol and implementation of the first tcp/ip connection was done by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn.
* The first hypertext browser and HTTP connection was designed and implemented by Tim Berners Lee
* The first LaTex implementation was done by Leslie Lamport
* Up to a functioning revision, the entire linux kernel was implemented by Linus Torvalds
* Minix was entirely written by Tenebaum
* C++ was written by Bjarne Stroustrup
* Java was invented James Gosling
* Python was written initially by Guido Rossum
* PHP was written by Rasmus Lerdorf
A surprising amount of software and systems that where hugely influential where written by one or two people. It didn't stay at one or two people of course, later others joined in, whole industries joined. But the functioning kernel of the development, where often one or two very talented people. What they wrote often shares certan characteristics. It may not have been perfect, but it often came out basically fully grown and ready to use. This is not surprising, because it would be rare that broken and dysfunctional software would generate a huge amount of enthusiasm around (how PHP got on track is a bit of a mystery though).
It is difficult for non programmers to understand this. Intuitively it would seem that herculean tasks would be much easier to perform for whole teams or companies well staffed and funded.
But the reality is, that this often simply isn't true.
* The productivity gap between highly skilled to low skilled developers can be as much as 50x
* A large number of highly skilled people usually don't get along well
* Having a lot of capital, stakeholders, management and opinions on a project introduces a very large overhead that one or two people don't have to worry about
There are many more such points, but you get the idea.

MtGox had an exchange traded volume of around 50kbtc/month. That was around 1/4 of the exchange traded volume globally (around 200kbtc).
To each trade there would have been two sides, demand and supply. The supply of these coins has now dried up, for whatever reason. However the demand, although diminished, is still able to move to other exchanges.
So demand is continuing around the same number, but supply is diminished by 25%.

Naked shorting of stocks in all fairness is relatively harmless (compared to other things). Naked shorting of commodities, oil, gold, silver, platinum, etc., of currencies and of debt is a much more worrysome development. Mainly because the market for those eclipses in size any stock market, but also because some of these have real-world, non-paper materials behind them, and it's pretty horrific for the real world if commodity prices are distorted due to an imaginary supply.
At least for stocks it's a solvable problem if you record them in a blockchain. For commodities, it's trickier because there you'd have to trust the issuer that the chain-commodity is actually backed 1:1 by the real thing.

They won't tell you that it's naked short selling. The proper term for that kind of thing is prediction markets and spread betting. These are the only instruments that aren't, by law, required to be backed by anything.
ETFs have to be backed, CFDs have to be backed, Futures have to be backed (far as good faith in delivery goes). Some of these may impinge on naked shorts, but aren't supposed to.
What cannot be less than 100% backed are plain exchanges. At least in theory. If something calls itself a "Bitcoin Exchange", it has to be 100% backed. If it's a bank, it may be fractionally backed. Everything else cannot call itself an exchange.

If you're gonna get into anything, buying bitcoins, buying a car, buying gold, buying insurance, buying stuff online etc. And there's a potential for you to get ripped off in some way that'd bother you. What you do is you look around who had previous experience with what's on the offer. See what they say. The simplest for instance would've been to google "MtGox scam". You'd be presented with pages and pages and pages of forum posts, reviews, complaints and what have you dating back all the way to 2011.
Now there's usually two explanations for this odd fact, that there might be a massive amount of seemingly unconnected critisism of Gox. Either the entire internet has conspired against gox, or they suck balls, you decide.
But if you didn't even look in the first place, then what you essentially did is this:
* Find the first company offering something
* That's halfways around the world
* With no juristiction where you can get at them
* Send them money on blind faith
* Without keeping tabs afterwards as to their trustworthyness
Do you really think you should have the gall to complain about anything? You should read this, and read it well:

Satoshi as they found him, would definitely not be considered a public person. That means that, they would have to get permission from him to publish the article, that they did.
I seriously doubt that they got permission from him.
The law exists precisely to avoid situations in which some sensationalist publication destroys somebodies life. Newsweek almost assuredly run afoul of this.
It's a bit like winning the lottery. From here on out, the Nakamotos can go to court everytime they they want and extract money out of Newsweek. It means, that they alone, are now responsible for anything unfortunate that could befall the Nakamotos as a result of their shoddy reporting.

A couple of remarks on twobitidiot.
1. He stated that he sold his coins, because he would otherwise be insolvent... that's one of the most stupid things I ever heard a grownup person say. Even the very core developers keep a good chunk in fiat as not to be entirely exposed to the exchange risk and be able to pay for food, shelter and taxes. It also suggests that he's in the red, i.e. he bought **all** his bitcoins on the very top. Is this really the kind person you should listen to with any authority on any matter to do with markets?
2. He stated he sold his coins acting on inside information 10 minutes prior to releasing it. Everybody understands this motivation. I don't think he should have done that though. It is basically insider trading, and not only that, he was also personally responsible for the release, which makes it basically price manipulation for your own gain, which is, as I understand it, quite a bit worse than just insider trading.
3. 6 days ago he didn't even know how to install a wallet.
4. He runs to the press and sensationally backstabs bitcoin every chance he gets.
5. He speaks as if he's part of some community. As in "Stop screwing up our business.". Uhm, somebody who has in this short a period of time turned out to be: Technically and bitcoin illiterate, press Whore, horrible trader, horrible financial manager, insider trader and market manipulator has no place, using the word "our".

I don't want rain on your nice pump you got going there, and it'd be a shame if something happened to it but... I've got bad news for you.
Bitcoins are not anonymous, they're synonymous. Meaning that as long as you didn't associate an address in some way with you, nobody knows whom it belongs to. But once you associate your address just once, they're fully transparent. Every transaction is on the blockchain.
There are of course ways to migitate that issue. But they require that you know what you're doing, and never, ever, make a single mistake. I'd hazard a guess that this would be safely outside of the skill of the average corruptible official, so there's that.

Yeah that's gonna be fun. They can't sell it on an exchange obviously, they made damn sure there's none with the required depth.
So they do it like all forfeitures, an auction. But there's the thing that'll twist their noodle. If you're trying to auction off bitcoin, you're basically still engaging the market.
And people with the pockets deep enough to afford that kind of stash, they're not gonna bid all the way to the market price or beyond, probably not even close.
The Feds could actually end up holding their stash having failed to reach the minimum bid price for it in one big lump. They'll then have to overthink strategy. Hmmm, I wonder what that would be, ah I know...
They Feds could open a website where they sell off tiny chunks of their stash to individuals. But wait, how do they know they're not getting fleeced? Well, obviously the Feds will have to run an actual exchange, so that they don't have to rely on other exchanges quotes.
And that is how the US will open its first bitcoin exchange.

* WebGL allows you to do things like speed up D3 substantially, draw fast heatmaps, draw 3D content and so forth. It's OpenGL ES 2.0 for the web.
* WebRTC is useful for realtime streaming of of audio/video content. WebRTC data channels are UDP for JS. You can also do peer2peer networks with WebRTC, which is useful in many contexts like local gaming, etc.
* The performance/timing API lets you measure time precisely (sub-millisecond precision with performance.now()) and analyze running application performance automatically (not when debugging, but for every user of your application), helping you identify bottlenecks that you didn't get on your machine.
* getUserMedia allows you to capture audio/video input from a camera or microphone. In conjunction with WebRTC, it's useful for doing things like voice/video calls/conferencing. It can also be used to do things like scan QR-codes from the phones camera or build photo editing integrations.

I wouldn't mind DRM if it wouldn't mean that I can't play any content on any computer I have. You see the problem is:
1. No content distributor can cover conceivably all platforms, and there's more of them than ever before
2. Content distributors use DRM to lock out competition from the market (that's a rather complex story, you can ask me if you want)
So there's the DRM'tards like you, who're arguing "DRM IS A MUST, YOU FREETARD". And then there's people like me, who'd gladly pay for the content, but are inable to either pay or consume it.
As a pretty simple rule of thumb, if your business engages in a practice that makes it unable to acquire a potential customer, who wants to give you money, and you would want to give him your service, then you're doing something very, very, very, very, wrong.

* In 2011 bitcoin was on a run, up to $30 and then fell off a cliff. The reason? MtGox had outages and trading slowdowns. The term goxxed was invented.
* 2012 various repeat performances of no great magnitude
* 2013 April bitcoin was on the run again, up to $260, at the top the MtGox outages started to happen and MtGox suspends cash withdrawal.
* 2014 bitcoin is still stabilizing from the last runup, MtGox suspends bitcoin withdrawal and pisses all over bitcoin, ending in a drawdown from $825 to $650.
All trough this people had increasing problems with MtGox.

Andreas has stated that the "cold" wallets of Gox wheren't cold, and that there was an automated process to transfer funds from them to their "hot" wallet.

* They where vulnerable to the malleability attack since their inception
* Which resulted in all funds on gox to be drained away over 3 years and sold into the market by a myriad of scammers.

So... you needed a chart to figure that out? :)
As to the analysis of price, it's relatively easy to show that yours is wrong.
The price for bitcoin is essentially the price for a virtual commodity. It's determined by supply and demand. It's got some favorable properties valued by whoever builds a utility or value around it for whatever reason.
A commodities price will not "just go down" as long as somebody still needs/wants that commodity. In a commodity market, supply follows demand, that is, if say gold is appreciating, more people setup gold mines, which takes time, but eventually they come online, and so supply increases and hence eventually balances demand.
Bitcoin is a bit quirky in that respect, it has an inelastic supply. No matter how much or little incentive you give miners to mine it, the amount of bitcoins coming out as a result of that effort is always the same.
However, over time, the supply (as a percentage of the circulation) goes down, and it also goes down because of reward halving every 4 years. So it's entirely possible that the demand for bitcoin wanes, and hence the price depreceates. But once that is over, and given enough time, this trend can as well reverse, since, again, the supply is completely inelastic. So once the price reflects a lowered demand, even a small rise in demand can shoot up the price substantially.

1. Keep your funds on GOX

3. Keep your head in the sand to the troubles brewing since 2011

* If you're actively trading, you were paying attention.
* If you weren't paying attention, you weren't trading, why would you have your funds on Gox?
* If you were paying attention, why would you keep your funds on Gox?
Bottom line is, you can't weasel yourself out of your own responsibility if you lost stuff on Gox.

Because hundreds of people would've done the same, at the same time, driving the price well over $700 and beyond. That's the whole reason to buy on an auction where the price isn't disclosed (at least not immediately). To avoid the hefty open-market premium.
A below market bid would indicate that you believe there where fewer bids (demand) on the auction then there where bitcoins on the auction (supply). As a matter of fact, that was not the case. There where far more bids for the coins than there where coins, which indicated that only a small percentage of the highest bidders where going to get any. This fact **dictates**, literally **dictates** that the auction, **too**, is going to command a premium. Just not as hefty a premium as the open market, but a **premium** no matter which way you're trying to put it.
And just because **you** don't agree with the **obvious** logic of the situation, the way it **actually** turned out is **exactly** what I'm describing. You're trying to argue the reverse of what actually happened. I frankly can't **fathom** the merit of trying to argue in a fashion that's already been disproven by **fact**.

I can prove to you that, your entire assertion is faulty.
Highly reliable systems exist, that go far beyond 99.99%, so far, that it becomes virtually indistinguishable from 100%. You're probably familiar with one of these systems, it's called the blockchain.
Now, Gox isn't failing to keep internal accounts. You can do that with an extremely high reliability and classical system engineering. No, Gox is failing to make transactions hit the blockchain.
So, whatever else broke in your system, issuing valid transactions into the peer 2 peer network for entry into the blockchain is something you can always rely on. And, as long as you kept an uncorruptible record (which is possible) you can always re-issue these transactions even in the case of catastrophical failure of everything else.
Running an exchange, is not like, running a space shuttle. The comparison is simply false. The challenger blew up because a sealing ring failed, and they torched the liquid hydrogen/oxygen tank. Any space related system, is full of such "cannot fail" components. By contrast, you can build software that has no such component. It may be full of faulty components, but they won't make the entire system explode. This is a paradox between software engineering, and real world engineering. It's well known that you can build 100% reliable systems, on highly faulty infrastructure.

You don't understand, the input adress is drained. The output isn't set, it's added. If the source and change are the same address, then then the input is first drained, and then refilled in one transaction. You do not set the balance of outputs, you set the balance of inputs, to zero.
In order to figure out the balance of an address, you need to sum all its inputs. You don't need to go beyond the inputs. If the last transaction on an address is a spend, you don't even need to look at the inputs. Because the balance is in the change.
But that is entirely irrelevant, you're basically doubting multibit can work. Well though news, multibit does work. It does not miss transactions on an address. And it updates from the network without d/l the whole blockchain.

You don't get it do you? For you, it might not matter that Gox sucks. You essentially state "as long as they make me whole eventually, I don't care".
For Gox itself, it's a different story. If they fuckup they lose customers. Every single time they fuckup, they lose a customer. It doesn't matter if it's a temporary or permanent fuckup, they lose customers.
Having customers is the lifeblood of Gox'es business. Not fucking up is their  priority. There's literally nothing more important for them than that. It doesn't matter if somebody out there dies if they fuckup, or loses their live savings, or if it's merely an inconvenience, for them the result is the same, their business goes belly up.
If you're responsible to run the system, which will literally make or break the company, you carry a grave responsibility. The reliably, fast and smooth functioning of that system draws the dividing line between you, your boss and coworkers having a job and keeping investors/shareholdes happy, and you, your boss and your coworkers not having a job and your investors/shareholders suing you.
Failure to properly run such systems mostly boils down to 2 factors:
* Not realizing you even have such a system, which would be gross management incompetence.
* Not hiring people competent enough, or not capable of shouldering the responsibility, which would be gross management incompetence.
Bottom line is that, to Gox get to where they are now, requires for everybody up the chain of command to have failed catastrophically.
It does not bode well for the assumption that this is only a technical problem, if the management of the company is incapable of identifying cruical parts of their business and/and staffing in a fashion suitable to perform their core business function reliably, fast and smooth. It kinda makes you wonder what other parts they fucked up badly, like say, balances on their books.

Well, if you reject that assertion. What's the theory then? An altcoin is true competition to Bitcoin, but when Bitcoin does bad, it also does bad? Competition means that if one party does good, the other does bad relatively. Altcoin/BTC prices are a perfect expression of relative sentiment.
So if you are truly competing with bitcoin, then the /BTC price would express this sentiment. And if doesn't, well, the market is never wrong you know?

In the span from early 2011 to today (911 days)
* 533 up days, up on average 3.6%
* 377 down days, down on average 3.5%
* 21 up months, up on average 43%
* 9 down months, down on average 16%
Those are from actual numbers, not some imaginary projections across smooth log-curves trough time. This means that if you have a holding time of 1 day, you've got a 30% chance to lose 3.5% and a 70% chance to win 3.6%. If you have a holding time of 30 days, you've got a 42% chance to lose 16% and a 58% chance to win 43%.
Those aren't the "omgwtf 20% return per month" numbers you're trying to cast them as. Yes, if you're holding for a long time, the monthly return is great. But in the interrim you're not following some perfectly smooth compound log curve and roll in your unrealized profits. You're going trough an extremely high volatility rollercoaster. It's extraordinary returns, but it's also extraordinary risk. Somebody stubs his toe on a coffee table in china, you can lose 16% or more of your investment.

Yeah, but secondmarket themselves had to buy into a larger bucket of thousands of btc at a time.
If the 100-130 or syndicate members all decided to buy the 3000-5000 bitcoins on the open market, it'd drive the price up all the same like it would if a single bidder on the auction would do that, don't make a yota of difference.
So if you're looking to buy 40 or so bitcoin at market value, by yourself, that's ok. But if 100 - 130 or so people are doing the same thing, at the same time. You'll end up paying a hefty premium.
Seeing as the price went up from $590 at the time of the auction to about $660 right now, there's a variety of people who lost the auction who're doing exactly that, they're buying on the open market **because** they lost the auction, **because** they bid too low and **now** they are paying an already substantial (11%) premium over market at the time. So it **would** have made sense to bid over market (say 5% or whatever) and they'd still be better off than buying on the open market **today**.
An auctions intent is to fetch the highest price anybody is willing to pay. It's not first come first serve or some exchange matchmaking algorithm. It was perfectly predictable that bids would outpace market price at the time, just as it was perfectly predictable that a reasonable premium yesterday would turn into a handy discount today and the days to come.

I think it's fairly straightforward. Whenever some price quotes are listed, it should be clearly indicated which are real exchanges, and which aren't. That's something the community can do without any guidance or regulation, just make sure that if you're quoting prices from somewhere, you ascertain the nature of the source and properly classify it into exchange or betting casino.

Actually proper short selling is when the broker has a stock of an asset and lends it to somebody (figuratively) by selling it in his name.
If the price goes up, the borrower has to pay back the difference, such that the owner of the asset doesn't make a loss. If the price goes down, the borrower can ask for the asset to be bought back at a cheaper price, the difference is the borrowers profit from that trade, and the owner of the asset has the same amount of that asset again.
It is technically illegal that somebody would lend out the assets held by others without their consent. But something being technically illegal rarely stops Wall Street from anything.

Wall Street isn't used to commodities that are virtually free to take delivery of. And I strongly suspect that with the new breed of Wall Street "exchanges" you won't be able to take delivery at all.
It's important to clearly differentiate quotes from real exchanges that allow for proper delivery, and from fake "exchanges" that don't allow you to take delivery. If you can't take delivery, it's virtually guaranteed the exchange engages in naked short selling and has little or no bitcoins at all backing their "trading activity".

I know somebody who's bought near the last peak, and I told him "look dude, it could be the peak, I understand you want those coins right now, I'm just saying, maybe dollar cost average a bit, take it slow.". Then when the price hit 570 the other day, he sold. I told him "look, it could be the bottom, maybe it isn't, but you're gonna sell at a loss, why not just wait and see?"

Goxes Motive is:
* To make profits
* To increase profits
From this motive, we can formulate Gox objectives:
* Retain customers
* Acquire customers
In order to reach their objectives, they have to manage their operations:
* Make sure their service works (service)
* Make sure withdrawals of both fiat and bitcoin works (integration)
* Make sure to be perceived trustworthy, competent and favorable (PR)
If Gox fails to manage their operations, they cannot reach their objectives. If they cannot reach their objectives, they cannot act in accordance to their motivation. It follows that Gox would be highly motivated to manage their operations (which includes PR) as good as possible. This is what people expect of companies. This is what companies do. It is part of the Customer/Company relationship.
Gox is failing badly at managing their operations in every one of the key areas. It follows that Gox would be highly motivated to manage their operations, including PR. Since we know that Gox would be highly motivated to get their PR right, which isn't as difficult as getting other parts of the operation right, it follows that:
* They are either not motivated manage their operations or
* That the PR they are doing is the best they can do given the circumstance they are in.
And that is the core of the issue. If Gox is not motivated to manage their operations, it can only mean that they do not see running the business as the best way to make profits. That would be very troublesome for everybody who has funds at Gox. If Goxes PR is the best they can do given the circumstances, that means that circumstances at Gox would be very dire indeed.
Either way, it's very bad.

It's a little more complicated than that. A low CNY price helps exports and hurts imports. It also hurts businesses overall trough inflation.
Yes the Chinese government does this on purpose. But there's a reason they do, which is that their growth has been suffering from speculative bubbles which then didn't deliver. For example, whole shipyards, factories and city-blocks where erected in the hopes that business will grow into them, only to fall onto the harsh reality that it didn't happen and that now huge swaths of speculative infrastructure are rotting unused.
If China can't get their business by any means somewhere near where the speculative bubbles want it to be, they're facing down the barrel of most of the bubbles popping at the same time. So yes, they do it on purpose, but that doesn't mean they can stop.

That's why I said averaged and not compounded. The math isn't wrong, you're just not reading what I write. Which is quite typical of this sub.
But if you want to go at this by some non averaged measure, which you aren't doing anyway since you state "omgwtf 20%/month return is insane", it's that you take the averaged bitcoin return number for a year divided by 12. Most months that's not what bitcoin does, most months it makes backwards, briefly to be interrupted by a few weeks of bubbling every 6 - 24 months, where it does the insane part. The statement that bitcoin goes up every year is also not true. It just depends on where you put the yearly frame, if you put it the right way, bitcoin flipflops between up and down years.

It's true that you can run a fractional reserve and emulate much of the behavior of naked shorting.
There's a difference though. If you do a fractional reserve, there's a backing entity (the US government) that says in case of a run it covers customer funds (how realistic that is is another question).
So I don't particularly object to the fractional reserve (well I do, but that's another topic). But if you run a fractional reserve, you'll need to make sure that you can back up your deposits. That means that the US government would have to hold bitcoins adequate to back up the fractional reserves of those institutions.
Anyways, at a bare minimum, an exchange has to allow for deposit and withdrawal, if they already fail on that further discussion on the nature of the exchange is superfluous.

Think about it for a second. P2Pool uses collective power to find a block, and it uses "miniblocks" and their own blockchain to prove that everybody was honest and had been doing work. So unless you can get a fair amount of miniblocks in per round, it's going to be highly variable for you.
In order to minimize network bandwidth p2pool chooses a "mini-difficulty" based on the average hashrate of their own blockchain. So if you're sitting in the same pool with your jalapeno as somebody with a 4th rig, obviously the mini-difficulty wills shoot up way beyond what your jalapeno can reasonably operate with (you won't be able to register a single share per round with your jalapeno).
You could then open another p2pool, only stuffing it with small miners, and even though variance from share distribution would be less, you'd suffer beceause of variance of overall low hashing power of the pool.
So no matter what way you slice and dice it, small miners aren't the intended target audience. But that's not really a problem. Small miners are also not the problem. All the jalapenos and hashfasts and whatever sold to date don't make a fraction of a percent of the networks hashing power.

There is no prediction you can make that is not based on what happened up to that point in the past. TA or anything else.

And this would lead to the logical conclusion that price is worthless, because it's being made by people attempting to make predictions. Therefore your argument is, any price that varies is worthless. You must be very puzzled by a world in which things have prices, as opposed to everything costing 0.

Somehow you missed the part where I explained that FDIC emergency fund cover 1% of deposits, but that 2 institutions have 80% of deposits... and that it'll take congress, senate, each both sides of the isle and the president to release more funds to FDIC in case the emergency funds run out. Which will take weeks, if it happens at all (these days you never know). It's part of the reason the banks where bailed out. The other reason is that although FDIC covers deposits, it only covers up to $250k. And while that may sound like much, rest assured that the stink you'd be having at your hands if you bail-in those over $250k would be unimaginable.

I was here april last year. I was also here in 2012 and 2011, here's what's new:
* Protesters camping out Gox offices
* Fiat withdrawal and bitcoin withdrawal frozen, simultaneously, for over 2 weeks
* Complete price disassociation to other exchanges
* r/bitcoin filled with Gox posts at times 4 pages deep from the frontpage, nearly universally bashing them every which way.
* Ticker/Index sites delisting gox in droves
No single one of these things, let alone all of them, have happened in with gox at any time since 2011, that much I know. There might be some very early history that might be worse in 2010 and 2009, but if that was so, it was played out at a much smaller stage.


If gox is manages to turn around and resume processing withdrawals at full volume, I have little doubt this will come to pass.
I have no doubt because confidence in gox has been shaken to the core (nobody would keep his assets on there after the last 2 weeks). However at the same time, people have been buying "goxcoins" at extremely cheap rates (1/5th or less) of market rates. Some even sent gox more money to get into the goxcoin bet. These speculators are betting on the resumption of withdrawals so they can flip the coins out of gox onto other exchanges and sell them at a 600% markup.
For me the question is in **if** Gox resumes withdrawals. Nobody can say how likely this really is, but it's not looking terribly promising.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:53:00
It's probably not "the thief" but thousands of thieves. And as to the whereabouts of the criminal proceeds it's probably pretty hopeless to attempt recovery, because it will have long since been tumblered trough mixers and sold into exchanges.
It's also doubtful Gox even knows who stole from them because:
* They run a long time without identity verification
* Identities could be faked
* It would depend on their system logging away all relevant details to transaction repeats, which might not be the case.
But even if identities present and accurate and suitable transaction repeat logs are available, recovery is still pretty much hopeless because then you'd have to attempt to reel in thousands of criminals from all over the world who meanwhile have probably gotten rid of the funds anyway.
So just like it's Foolish to hold out hope of any Gox recovery. It's hopeless to hold out hope that magically the stolen proceeds could be returned.

The thing is that unless China can expand exports, they got no leg to stand on economically. And unless they have a weak CNY they can't expand exports. And if they can't expand exports, all their insane bubbles are gonna pop.
Regarding a "strong" reserve currency, that never really worked. The reason the USD had become a reserve currency has to do with the post WW2 pegging to the USD and later petrodollars. The reason it never really worked is that the US just kept printing money in order to satisfy economic policies/wars, but that what they printed wasn't backable by gold.
It's always the same thing that happens, a gold standard breaks because they can't turn off the presses. Won't be different for china, except, this time around, everybody's already learned that lesson. So if china's gonna attempt a gold experiment, I think many will be very sceptical that whenever china's gonna fall on hard times, they'll not just print more CNY and gold be damned.

As if anybody still needed a reason to withdraw money from you, and much less needed to explain it to you. In fact, HSBC before you let your tellers open their pieholes or write another mail, do this right now:
* Sit down and list how many dirty businesses you've been in publicly in the last 12 months.
* If you're about to ask any question of a customer that you can answer yourself on moral grounds (you know what that is right?) by that list SHUT YOUR FUCKING PIEHOLE and do what your customer asks of you.

Bitcoin has significant risks, such as:
* 51% attacks
* Volatility
* irreversible transactions
* market manipulation
* electronic theft
* low liquidity
Benefits of bitcoin may include:
* +1000%/year appreciation (historical)
* Fast transactions (within 60 minutes)
* Low transaction fees
* Cannot be counterfeit
* Limited in supply
Fiat has significant risks:
* Unlimited supply
* Quantitative easing
* +100% base money expansion
* inflation (+2% year usually, but may go to +10000000%/year)
* bail-ins
* institutional seizure
* slow transactions (may take longer than a week)
* high transaction fees (may exceed 20%)
* blocked transactions (randomly)
* counterfeiting

* There's no exchange that "just works", want to move things along? Make an exchange that works.
* Banks are discriminating against bitcoin businesses and make it difficult for them to get bank accounts. Banks are also closing bank accounts of people who do anything with bitcoins, often handing them cashier checks, and then they can find no other bank to accept the checks. Want to move things along? Create a bank that doesn't discriminate against bitcoin businesses and holders. Better yet, roll that bank into one with an exchange, happiness ensues.
* There's all these big securities and commodities exchanges. Yet, none of them lists bitcoin outright. That just doesn't seem right.

So far, it was "worth" 21% of their own ROI for them. It can get arbitrarily worse than that, it can easily get to a loss of 50%, 80% and 99% and more of their ROI.

Great thinking, added it to the list.
But yeah, this is if you point out the folly of trying to cheat the taxman (the greatest conman of all time) you're getting downvoted. Somehow people seem to think that bitcoin magically solves the IRS. Just wave the magic bitcoin wand and fairy dust sprinkles everywhere distracting the IRS and they don't look too closely. Uh-hum :)
And you know what the sad thing is? There's some idiots that read such stuff here, and **believe** it. And then they go on and didn't declare their gains, revenue and purchases they made with bitcoin, and then the IRS comes knocking, and believe you me, if you thought the taxes where expensive, you have no idea how expensive it's gonna get once they audit you and find your compliance lacking.
The reason anybody with two braincells does their best to keep in compliance and not have them come knocking on your door, isn't because they're not pleasant to talk to. It's because once they come, it's gonna cost you, big time.

If you're discounting Opera (which is just plain wonky, always has been, always will be), safari-mobile is actually the least standards conform and feature sporting browser you can get. Any way you slice&amp;dice it, chrome mobile, firefox mobile and IE mobile are more standards conform and sport more modern features.
Safari-mobile **is** truly the IE6 of mobile browsers.
It's sad because there was a time when safari-mobile was anything but, it was, once, a long time ago, on a device far far away the most awesome mobile browser. But, in those days it competed with the built-in dumbphone WAP browsers and Windows CE browsers. But, you know, that was the same for IE6 once. There was a time IE6 was the most awesome browser, and it kicked netscapes butt. But then Microsoft got it in their head that, having won the OS war, and the Browser war, they can now rest on their laurels and simply never update or fix their product.
But those days are gone, they're soon gone a decade. And Apples decision not to compete with their browser is, inevitably, hurting them now. Just as Microsofts decision not to compete anymore hurt them.

But look at this objectively. No business in the world would do to itself, what Gox is doing to itself. There must be a pretty damn good reason they're doing it. And short of losing everybodies funds, I can't think of any.
So as much as it sucks, you'll have to come to terms with this reality. There may never be better communication. And most likely there will never be any funds recovered by anybody. Reality doesn't care what happened to you. You can't change it. The sooner you start that process, the sooner **you** will be able to move on.
You can't change what happens with Gox. You can't change the past that made you keep assets on Gox. There is just one thing you can change, and that is, not wasting more time of your life worrying and being depressed about it. Shit happens, that's life.

If you're not brain dead, you will realize that this is the end of your company. And, you will do **everything** not to make it look that bad. So given that Gox isn't doing a good job at making it not look so bad, it suggests that as bad as it looks, that's the best they can do. And this, my friend, **is** a very scary thought.
Things are usually worse, than they're presented by the people who have every incentive to make it look as good as possible. So what's worse than how gox makes it look? Yeah, anybodies guess, but it's not good.

P2pool is a p2p network. The network distributes the coinbase, which contains the payout address of each miner. Miners include any transactions they want. To prove that miners do work, every miner publishes blocks he found that satisfy the lower p2pool difficulty. These are known as shares and they are registered in the p2pool blockchain. Once a block is found a new round begins and a new coinbase is constructed from shares registered in the p2pool blockchain.
P2pool isn't so much a pool, it's the end of pools.

Malleability messes with the ability to distinguish transactions by transaction ID. Some people (gox, *ahem*) rely on this mechanism to keep their stuff working.
Malleability is being discussed and fixed:
* [Ticket  last activity 4 months ago, still open, not merged
* [Ticket  last activity 5 months ago, closed, merged, introduces a stronger malleability breaker.
* [Ticket  last activity 3 days ago, slightly reduces size impact of malleability code, makes more tests pass, open, not merged.
* [Ticket  last activity 6 months ago, closed, merged, adds some safeguards against malleability
Forum threads:
* 
* 
* 
This doesn't mean Gox isn't screwed however. MtGox did run for a long time without requiring identification. And identifications can be faked. If somebody decided to defraud MtGox and claim to not have gotten his withdrawals for a large amount of coins by publishing a txid that gox didn't know about and get it into the blockchain first, it does mean that MtGox can be short on bitcoins. If they only notice this issue now, it's likely they're pretty damn short.
It's worth noting that Bitfunder, who was also in some kind of unspecified trouble, closed up shop and lost pretty much all deposits. It's somewhat likely Bitfunder fell prey to the same naive implementation of the protocol.
Paging perhaps provide an overview of what the efforts are (tickets, discussions etc.) and what still needs to be done to make txids reliable and when that is expected to finish, roll out and be installed at most miners machines.

It is technically impossible to layer additional rules on top of the block chain. The outcome of any such attempt will lead to a situation where it becomes so costly to verify who has what (due to the blockchain being large and full of faulty/malicious transactions for that top layer) that the only solution would be a centralized high performance clearing House. That of course would defeat the purpose. Therefore such attempts are doomed.

I don't think Gox qualifies as "a stable market". There's nobody enforcing fractional reserve requirements on Gox. There's nobody checking Goxes books and makes sure that their cash flow is not net-negative. There's no depositor insurance to cushion an eventual default. There's nobody making sure that whatever bets that Gox has going aren't overleveraged.
If Gox practices fractional reserve banking, then Gox would be a bank that has all the drawbacks of a bank, without any of the benefits (interest, oversight, regulation or depositor guarantees).

I'd like to draw attention to a bunch of pertinent facts:
* Zynga has made over $100m in sales in 2013
* Most of those sales are microtransactions in the range of $1-3
* That means it had around 30m to 100m transactions per year
* That makes around 1 to 3 transactions per second
* Bitcoin handles around 7 transactions per second (tops)
So if Zynga would start to conduct a large chunk of its business with bitcoin, and if other large parties start using it, the 7tx/s max is going to be quickly blown.  Even a 100tx/sec or 1ktx/sec or a 10ktx/sec might be quickly exhausted in short order if the market grows explosively (visa handles peaks of 11ktx/sec).
Simply lifting blocklimits (without other measures) is likely not going to work, as it would overwhelm network bandwidth of full nodes and mining nodes.
2014 is going to be the year in which bitcoin is going to figure out if it can scale or not.

It does assume a flat demand depth. I know that some will be more tempted to buy at lower prices. However I'm discounting traders from the demand equation because collectively they sell as much as they buy at any time.
Likewise you can discount (somewhat) people who buy bitcoin in order to spend them. At least in the end, their input is zero as well (however the carriage of the coins may still influence the demand, as they might not immediately make it back to an exchange).
The biggest influence in demand is people who buy bitcoins (for whatever reason) and take them out of the supply for a sustained amount of time.

See that's the funny thing. Today, is nothing special. It's not the end of bitcoin. It's not meaning anything about its viability. It's neither the longest decline in its history, nor is it the deepest so far. But everytime this happens, people come out of the woods "bitcoin is dead, that's it".
These episodes, it's part of bitcoin growing up. You can't avoid it, shit happens. Everytime it did, it came out stronger and more resilient. And this time is hardly an exception. So, you either believe that, or you don't. I'm here, because I believe that. And I believe it, because, it's so far been true. But such is the nature of things.

Apart from the obvious, I think there's an aspect to this most people miss.
Banks/Governments are led predominantly by older people (50+). There's a special demographic dynamic with that. They are the first leading generation in history to have spent their entire lives surrounded by immaterial government backed cash (gold standard was abandoned 1971), and by debt based instruments (credit cards).
In economic and monetary terms, these folks are illiterate. They have never seen real money. They wouldn't recognize real money if you clubbed them over the head with it. They've grown up in this bizarro world and made it almost to retirement age and it's been good to them. The baby boomers.
It's a well known effect that as you age, your neuroplasticity decreases. They're not just not willing to understand, they're incapable of understanding. They can literally not bend their brain enough to take in bold new concepts.
The rejection of bitcoin by the elite may stem from the simple fact that they're too old, come from a world that didn't need bitcoin and are now presented with something so mind-bendingly different that they have no mental model to deal with this except rejection.
This change will need time, lots of time. The average age of the elites in power isn't going down. But the elites are being gradually replaced by younger folks. Give it 20 years or so until the 30-somethings of today rise to positions of power, and you'll hear a very different tune.

You're not crazy, it may just be a bad bet.
Your bet has the following characteristic:
- Upside: 2.4x of what you put in.
- Downside: 0x of what you put in.
- Risk: unknown
In that kind of bet, you'd try to balance the risk with the reward. So for instance suppose you rolled the dice on that bet 100x, how many times would you have to win in order to be profitable? You'd put say $1 in at each roll, and you get out $2.4 or none. The roll has to be in your favor at least 42x (41.66x) so you get out with more than you put in.
Quantitatively this means that your bet was good if the chance of gox failing is less than 56%, and your bet was bad if the chance of gox failing is higher than 56%.
Nobody can tell you how likely it is that gox would be failing. However the signs of gox not failing don't look so good. No business does to itself what Gox is doing to itself without a darn good reason. Now it may be that Karpoppels just is the biggest PR clusterfuck, and everything else is fine. I find that theory exceedingly unlikely. I find the theory that Gox has a giant fucking problem and is therefore committing business harakiri voluntarily in an effort to buy them a little more time much more likely.

And I just spelled it out for you, that a rapid deterioration of the price doesn't give a shit, what miners give a shit or not about.
It doesn't matter if a miner gives a shit or not, the price **will** deteriorate. The miners hashing power doesn't get them magically more bitcoins because the price is going south.
And because miners have a +6 month investment in hardware for an ROI, as the price goes south, so will their ROI, permanently. It doesn't care if the miner is still running on ghash or not, or what the miner gives a shit about. ROI's gone, puff, adios, went to meet its maker, is no more.

You didn't understand. Either ghash limits itself (or gets limited by its users). Or the confidence in bitcoin will evaporate, completely, leaving it with a cratering exchange price level near zero, that'll wipe out ghash, any bitcoin company, any pool and bitcoin at large.
So ghashes "success" is self-limiting, either by consent, or by force, but either way, it **will** happen. Everybody would prefer the market wouldn't have to express its opinion by force. But if Ghash is going to leave the market no choice, the market's always efficient.

A [landmark case in 1749]( of Hew Crawfurd vs. the Royal Bank of Scotland firmly established that the fungability of money supersedes the individual right in a property.
This landmark case has been followed by virtually every other bank ever since up to the present day, and the few challenges to meet this notion where summarily defeated in court.
It's incomprehensible to me how an idiot moron like Alex Waters comes up with the idea how a practice firmly cemented in place by common consensus, law and government for 265 years for good reason, should be overturned.
Governing and lawmaking isn't about coming up with an ever longer list of contorted rules (although there is sadly enough of that going on). It is about how to aide the functioning of society by taking measures that produce most benefit with the least drawbacks. A law, agreement or policy aimed at erradicating some evil, at a greater cost to society than that evil represented, is the most retarded course of action imaginable. It's either undertaken by sheer stupidity, or by malice.

It's far from clear exactly how a eastern european conflict will influence bitcoin.
People haven't begun "Fleeing into USD".
In times of crises people tend to hoard whatever seems to them the least likely to be negatively impacted. For instance Gold began a remarkable rally in September 2001. A previous gold rally from 1969 to 1974 fell smack onto the vietnam war escalation and ended with the withdrawal from the US from vietnam.
It's likely that in case of escalating conflict in the Ukraine the stock market reaction would be very mixed. War tends to be bad to certain kinds of businesses, and very good to others. It's also likely that commodities generally will go up in war, because the war machines tend to either consume them, or limit their production substantially.
In times of war, monetary policy is usually relaxed and the government is usually going deeper into debt and is printing more money. This is a contraindication to the argument that fiat would be a safe haven.
Lastly, an escalating eastern european conflict could be accompanied by a simultaneous currency war. In the currency war, countries would try to devalue the enemies currency. One country in a good situation to do that would be China which is the largest holder of US debt.
Will Bitcoin (and the entire rest of the market) be influenced by a conflict? Yes. Does anybody know where it's going? No. Could be up, could be down, could be sideways, could be all of those.

But, a lot of times, the transfer is part of revenue, not income. And revenue tax is not the same as income tax.
For instance, say you run some small store that sells hardware. Your margin is usually somewhere around 5%. So your income, is those 5% which enables you to live off what you do. The other 95% are expenses you deduct off the revenue, and you flip that around to replenish your stock.
Now what happens to a store that gets a haircut off 20% of it's revenue, with a profit margin of 5%, even if it's temporary till you have declared taxes?
I can tell you what happens, that store will have less capital to replenish its stock than before the sale of any stock that's now gone. And this'll continue for a year. But a store like that doesn't have a capital reserve to buy a years worth of stock. Maybe a couple months, but that's pushing it.
So what's the store gonna do? Well, running out of capital to replenish your stock is not a good way to run a business, you'll be going belly up pretty fast. So how do you make sure, that doesn't happen? Easy, just **add** 20% to your sales price. Your sales might got down, but, at least you've got a positive cash flow **if** you make a sale.
Of course a business who offers services and goods abroad will now be 20% less competitive with the international competition. Naturally, this tool, will have severe effects on those businesses.
In conclusion, the Italians just shot themselves in the foot.

Doing PR and having a PR department are two different things. You're suggesting that somebody who bought a company and went on to try to run it, isn't giving a thought about how he'll present things to the public.
While I like bashing on krapapples as much as the next guy, it's simply "off". You don't voluntarily damage the company that you built unless you have to. So you don't present a new option, they're either unmotivated to run their operations, or the PR they do is the best they can manage, and both are not good things.

Look, bitcoin has a block every 7-odd minutes. People don't like solo or small pools, because they're exposed to the entire variance of luck. But, that's still more than 200 blocks/day.
So, long as a pool can get 2-4 blocks a day, the variance is really not that big. Some days it'll get 2, some it'll get 3, some it'll get 4, you get the picture. You join for a couple months, and it's completely even.
So 200 blocks/day easily supports some 50-odd pools. Maybe it's 25, or whatever, but, point is, it's not the lack of blocks that's the problem.
So, having 4x more blocks, doesn't actually encourage 4x more pools. The problem is, people swarm to the pools with least variance. So the distribution of hashrates isn't even between pools.
To really solve this problem, is really hard. There's some innovative pools that're trying to address that issue in some way, with some or another fancy technology. But the bitcoin protocol doesn't force everybody to participate at that level. You'll always get pools that aren't interested much.
Simply lowering blocktime is tricky business because too many blocks per time unit leads to more forks in the chain, which makes everything less efficent, and that's not a way to get rid of pools, because then you'd need like millions of blocks per second.

Despite 3 years of endless warning by the community people traded on Gox. Look, I know it sucks, I've been there, not with Gox, but otherwise, it sucks, it sucks a lot, lord don't I know how it sucks.
But here's the thing, in retrospect, there are always clear signs. Signs you choose to ignore. There's only one reason to have funds on gox, that's when you actively trade. If you actively trade, you're not ignoring the state of affairs. If you don't ignore the state of affairs, you'd have KNOWN, with certainty, that gox was crooked for 3 FUCKING YEARS. And if you didn't pay attention to the state of affairs, then you wheren't trading, and if you wheren't trading, then you had NO FUCKING BUSINESS KEEPING YOUR STUFF ON GOX.
And that's the simple hard truth. Yes gox fucked up, it's goxes fault. But the people who trusted gox made it possible, and they should have known better, a lot of people, in fact KNEW BETTER. And freely shared this advise every which way. In the end, that's all you can do. People don't want to listen and put their assets on GOX, that's their own fucking choice.

The main reason that TXes fail is that the output is already spent.
Imagine, you where a sort of bitcoin bank. And that, for some reason the bitcoins you "store" are fewer than the bitcoins you owe to your depositors, this would commonly be known as "fractional reserve banking". There could be many reasons for this fact to exist, you could mainly divide them into two categories: There's temporarily fewer because they're stored offline or in obligations with a 100% guarantee to return, or there's permanently fewer because of technical incompetence (you lost them), or confiscation (the government seized them) or because you gambled them away in some fashion.
Now, MtGox doesn't pay interest. And they don't state that they do fractional reserve banking. In statements made in interviews they said they hold the entire funds of their customers. So it's commonly assumed that MtGox isn't gambling with the bitcoins or money you give them. However imagine you wanted to hide the fact, that you don't have all your customers bitcoins. So obviously, when somebody wants to withdraw, you can't give everybody the coins. But you can't admit to not being able to give them the coins. If you simply wouldn't issue a transaction, that'd be admission that you don't have the bitcoins. So instead you're issuing a transaction, which makes most users happy, but it's an invalid transaction (outputs already spent), and then you blame technical difficulties. They've been doing that since more than a year.
Apparently MtGox thinks this slight of hand will keep people from doing a bankrun or outright blaming them for losing their money.
TL;DR: the most likely reason the problem exists is because MtGox is out of coins and cash, because they lied about fractional reserve banking and made some big mistakes and basically lost your funds.

No of course not. There's many factors involved in this, and the reality isn't so straightforward.
But let me put it like that. How much hardware and electricity a miner can afford is basically dictated by two things. How many coins he can get with it, and the exchange rate (because that tells him how much hardware and electricity he'll get for coins).
The exchange in turn, is basically a popularity and adoption expression. Many people want in, it goes up.
This poses an interesting question. What's the motivation to execute a 50% attack from the governments side? Well, the motivation of course would be if the whole bitcoin thing got too popular, right?
But what happens if it gets too popular? Well, the price goes up. What happens to miners if the price goes up? They're stacking on more hardware and electricity. So to some degree, it's a self balancing function.
If bitcoin should flounder from this point on, the hashrate will stagnate, and there'll be little motivation for a government attacker to actually put the resources into executing the attack.
If bitcoin should however be more successful in the future, the hashrate will soar and it'll raise the bar to execute the attack.
So to put it simply, I believe that should there really be a motivation to make the attack, that at the time the motivation makes things move, the target for the attack will be receding before the attackers eyes. And I put a time horizon on that, of no more than 24 months at current hashrate increases.

See my edit, p2pool is actually pretty cool. It's not scouts honor at all, everybody has to publish proof at a lower difficulty. You can't know beforehand which work will produce the blocks at the lower difficulty, so it's a valid proof of work, that cuts down on the size of he proof substantially.
It's in fact such a good idea, I'm wondering why it isn't being integrated right back into bitcoin. It's proof of having hashed.

A list of banking institutions to avoid:
* Hong Kong Shanghai Banking (HSBC): Actively and historically active in the facilitation of criminal activity, particularly related to drugs.
* JP-Morgan: For their active participation in a variety of frauds and ponzi schemes, of note the Madoff ponzi scheme.
* Goldman Sachs: For their participation in mortgage and credit fraud, most notably driving Greece to the border of ruin and selling fraudulent housing derivatives to pension funds leading up to the 2008 crash.
All of the banks and executives remain not prosecuted and all participate in enthusiastic corruption of state officials (the mildest form of which is lobbying).

Fortunately the solution to centralized pools exists and is ready to be used.
Instead of centralized pools, miners could use [p2pool]( It's fully decentralized. It uses its own blockchain to record shares, can't be corrupted, can't defraud miners, has a very low cost and can't be used for nefarious purposes.
The easiest attack on centralized pools is not to give them power. Vote with your hashrate and just say [no](

I think what OP means is that nobody is cushioning any blows or hypes. There's no bitcoin central bank that would institute some bitcoin QE, interest rates and money borrowing to keep it stable. There's no bitcoin enforcement agency occupied with regulating what everybody does. There's hardly any regulation at all (yet) globally.
Sufficient to say, that doesn't make bitcoin non-volatile. However, it also makes it resillient. As the price incorporates any good and bad news it releases tension that would otherwise build up. Bit like tectonic plates. Occasionally you'll get an earthquake which releases tension. The longer earth holds it in, the bigger it gets. Same with financial markets.

I make a point that as a software engineer, you do not have to accept 99.99% reliability. You certainly don't have to accept 99% or 80% or 50%. You might have to accept less than 100%, but I'm pretty convinced you don't have to accept less than 99.99999% reliability (one in 10 million fails).
At the moment I'm running a webservice that gets hit by around a million requests/day. There is not one single well formed request I would drop. And 1/3rd of these requests are POSTs (i.e. they modify some data on the server). The service doesn't crash, stall, malfunction or misbehave in other ways.
The only reason I might have less than 100% reliability is because the servers power or uplink might fail.
Every change going into that service is tested with a days worth of recorded data and fuzzed data.
Building highly reliable systems is possible. It's not as insanely expensive or difficult as many people like to make it out to be.

Even thought the reasoning is utterly flawed, is the premise even defensible?
No, the premise of something growing too fast for its own good, is deeply flawed. Why? It's got to do with a false dichotomy. Implied in that statement are four possibilities:
1. A slow growing adoption and a slow growing infrastructure
2. A slow growing adoption and a fast growing infrastructure
3. A fast growing adoption and a slow growing infrastructure
4. A fast growing adoption and a fast growing infrastructure
The article bemoans option  That would imply that other options are a possibility or preferable.
1. It's not preferable to have a slow growing adoption, so this is also a false choice. The economist would simply bemoan a slow adoption instead of option 
2. If adoption was slow, so would be infrastructure growth, so this is a false choice.
4. An infrastructure outpacing the need for growth does not really happen. First of all, it's often a sign of resource miss allocation, but it also ignores the nature of "needs". Needs tend to fill the available means. For instance, network bandwidth (or disk space etc.) is usually consumed up to capacity. It's something that drives IT managers up walls. No, the infrastructure is usually growing in response to an expansion of the needs. Therefore, it's always lagging behind in capacity to what would be optimal. So this too, is a false choice.
Therefore, The Economists bemoans the nature of reality. They present a premise, that bemoans how things simply are, in real life, as something suboptimal, as if real life could magically be changed. They could as well bemoan the principle of demand and supply.
Here's another premise: At any time, the infrastructure required is exactly the infrastructure that's possible to deliver given the demand and market situation. It may not be enough, but it will never exceed demand, and given time, this situation rectifies itself.

Well, the number in your account means nothing, it's just a number in a database. It only means something if Gox can honor its desired transactions, which, for some or another reason, they're having trouble to do.
But see, the thing is this, if you run with the theory this is a technical issue (of which I'm entirely unconvinced), then the first instance of any transaction that fails should give them profound pause. Why?
If you have one failed transaction, you're gonna have a second one. And then another. And another, and they'll keep coming, until they appear at a rate that'll make it infeasible to humanly react to them.
This is why the 100% axiom is so important. You don't have to make your system work 100%. But you have to make sure, that when it fails, it recovers flawlessly 100% of the time. And not only that, you have to make sure it does that automatically, and quickly.
Because you don't, the failures will pile up beyond your means of handling them. This is the reality of scale. And you ignore it at your own peril.

Of course you can always find some place. But you realize this was a quantitative argument right?
So on the one hand, yeah, places could (and maybe some do) accept doge just as easily as they can accept bitcoin (alas bitpay, but I digress), or ixcoin, i0coin, freecoin, tardcoin, buttcoin, feathercoin, bbqcoin, anoncoin, peppercoin, terracoin, litecoin, devcoin, digicoin, namecoin, coino, ronpaulcoin, maxcoin, quark, liquidcoin, bitbar, netcoin goldcoin, qubic, timekoin, freicoin, geistgeld, solidcoin, tenebrix, fairbrix, coiledcoin, rucoin, mmmcoin, weeds, beetroken, nxt, globe, mastcoin and so forth (there's about a hundred more).
Point though is, why whould they? It requires having all those wallets around, and it's one heck of a confusing checkout dialog. On the other hand, anybody could just take bitcoin (and most that take any cryptocurrency accept that), and leave to their customers to make the appropriate conversion.
Case in point, more likely then not, if anybody accepts any altcoin, they immediately exchange it to bitcoin anyways.
What you're proving with "oh but people also take doge" is that you're essentially somebody who hasn't thought this trough. Not only is it not true, in a quantitative sense, it also misses the point that bitcoin *is* doing all the hard work to be exchange via fiat, and as an altcoin you can (and will) simply hitch a ride on that train. Now you can of course try to replicate all that work, for... zero gain.
Moreover, there is no altcoin that benefits directly (exchange rate by btc) from bitcoins (usd price) woes. This underscores the analysis that a continued wellbeing of bitcoin, is beneficial to altcoins, and the most obvious reason for that, too, is that bitcoin is their reserve currency.
Now you can think about this, and stop spewing utter nonesense, or ignore that bitcoin and altcoins are a members in a family working together, however, bitcoin doesn't need doge, so, if you insulate yourself from bitcoin, you do so at your own peril.

Well, r/p2pool points to p2pool.org. And p2pool.org advises you to point your miner at one of the "pool addresses" for each coin.
But that's the thing, if you use p2pool that's not what you do. You d/l the software, which is it's own p2p network, and you point your miner to that software. Pointing your miner to a foreign address like those offered by p2pool.org is just another instance of centralized pool.
It was perhaps inevitable that a centralized pool would pull that scam on p2pool, because p2pool threatens their existence.

**you** obviously didn't understand a single thing in what I was saying.
I said, there will be no profit, for any miner, in any pool, as the price rapidly approaches zero, if this situation persists.
Effectively, miners are trying to squeeze out a few % more profit, say 5%. However, they're sitting on hardware with an ROI time of more than 6 months, for the most part.
How will those miners feel when the price plummets to $100, then to $10, then to $1, then to $0.001 inside of days, not weeks or months? I guarantee you, it won't feel very good for them, sitting on an investment that's just about become worthless. Was trying to squeeze out 5% really worth losing 99.999% of your investment in hardware? We'll see.

I just explained to you why the price does what it does (supply &amp; demand). A companies stock goes down because the company is at the end of its life, as in, it doesn't turn a profit, or has made irrecoverable losses, or screwed up in some other fantastic way.
Bitcoin isn't a company, it can't go bankrupt. It could be that bitcoin is useless. I don't think so, and neither do you, apparently. It's a virtual commodity, and as long as somebody finds use, and wants one, price won't "just go down". It might stabilize somewhere far lower than where it is now, but it will stabilize, and then it'll go up again as its supply is inelastic, and the natural variation of demand can drive it up.

It's not a fallacy to assume that you need to have a financial incentive to have a secure blockchain.
Proof of work is the most secure mode of operating a blockchain there is. No other mode (proof of stake, central authority or whatever ripple does) even comes close to that level of attack resilience.
Proof of work (or even weaker forms of blockchains) eventually boils down to that wealth (in its various forms like energy and hardware) is consumed to secure the blockchain. The more wealth is used, the more secure it gets. If you use little wealth (as in voluntary altruistic feel-good charity mining), then somebody with more wealth at their disposal can easily attack the blockchain because their individual wealth exceeds the wealth of what the community invested by orders of magnitude.
This inevitably means that the second you try to make the blockchain of your altruismcoin secure, you kick off an arms race between those who'll want to attack it, and those who'll want to secure it. And since the attackers will use greater amounts of wealth, the supporters of the secure blockchain have no other choice than to out-invest the attackers in terms of wealth investment.
And pretty soon you'll reach the end of what people can provide altruistically in wealth to secure the blockchain, and you'll need to either:
1. Give up and accept that your altruismcoins blockchain is now centrally controlled by the attacker
2. Provide financial incentive to secure the blockchain so you can keep the attacker at bay, indefinitely.

You might turn out to be correct though. There is a perception of CHF being a stable FX haven, but this is largely illusory. In the period between 2008 and today, the SNB expanded base money by over 1000%, that's the largest QE anybody's done in the same period. The SNB used that money to acquire one of the largest EUR portfolios in existence, a portfolio which is now burning a hole in their pocket.
Obviously the freshly minted base money the SNB used to acquire EUR is now no longer in the SNBs hand. A major portion of it went to national banks where the SNB acquired their euros. In turn these banks pocketed a handy profit from this exchange, which fundamentally shifted the balance of who is the biggest holder of money (before 2008 it was the public by a ratio of 85%/15%, after it's the banks, pretty much with the reverse ratio).
The money itself that these banks pocketed is parked at the SNB, but now the SNB has also introduced ZIRP, and they lowered the rate from -0.25% to -0.75%, so those banks have very little incentive to keep their CHF stash at the SNB. It's quite possible that a diffusion of that 1000% base money increase is now going to be felt, as the banks shift their CHF stash into general circulation.

We can squabble about what kind of fork SegWit means, but that doesn't matter. Everybody agrees that SegWit is an opt-in mechanism, and as such, dependent on uptake, so it will not deliver substantial capacity increases the day it's introduced.
I don't debate that hard-forks have some economic impact, as they require everybody to update their software. But the fewer participants there are, the easier harforks are to make. The longer you wait to introduce a new feature that cannot be done other than a hardfork, the harder it gets to do it.
The second you realize that you cannot avoid doing a hardfork in the future, you should do that hardfork right now (or at the earliest feasible opportunity). Even better is if you can do that hardfork in a fashion that will not force you to hardfork in the future over the same issue again.
The blocksize debate has been going on ever since satoshi introduced the limit in 2010. And within just a few days of that discussion it was perfectly apparent (or at least should have been) that a future hardfork to adjust this would become necessary.
The blocksize issue should have been fixed 6 years ago. It wasn't, and eversince it wasn't, every year it gets harder to do.

When you have a severely restricted system that ordinary people cannot participate in because 1) a perpetually growing backlog of unprocessed transactions or 2) fees to high for use for individuals.

If you recall, physical properties give rise to socioeconomic properties. Abundance is an important factor for money because something has to be scarce enough to be worth something (i.e. lead is not a good money because obvious). But it also has to be abundant enough so that most everybody has an idea what it is. For instance palladium (for reasons of scarcity, difficulty in refining and occurence only in alloys) is also not good money, because it's not cognizable and common enough.
This is a long-winded way of saying, things have to be sufficiently available (and recognizable) enough, so that everybody can establish an opinion on its worth.
If you deprive a money of its availability and cognizability, then nobody will have an idea how to establish its value. Bitcoins are not abundant (or scarce) in the "extraction" kind of sense. But simply extracting something does not establish its worth. Paladium is extracted and refined, but that doesn't make it valuable as a money. In order for that extraction to have a purpose in the sense of a money, the money has to be accessible to society so that everybody can establish an idea of its value.
The idea to use bitcoin as the underlying commodity to be used by a second-tier system is hinged on the idea that bitcoins are worth something. Value is established by consensus, and that consensus is expressed when the money is used in its role as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a source of liquidity (that's what exchanges do btw).
It's very simple to understand that if you deprive your "money" fundamentally of the ability to act as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a source of liquidity, in order for it to act as an underlying for your second tier, that you are building your castle on sand, because now your money has no value anymore. And if your money has no value, then the second-tier of your money is equally useless.

Adoption is the driver of bitcoin, it's what took it from $0 to where it is today. You cannot stop adoption and expect bitcoin to be worth much or anybody to expend much effort to develop services around it, that's completely illusory.
Even if you silo most transactions into something not blockchain (sidechains, LN, whatever), these will have to make blockchain entries eventually. For instance, in LN you would have to open and close a channel. You will probably have many channels in use (for as many payment silos you use, like Visa, Apple-Pay, Google-Wallet etc.). Your funds will stem from yet another channel (one you would have say with an exchange like Coinbase). You will therefore open/close channels many times a year. Let's say typical use is around 5 channels, and about opening/closing each channel every couple of months. That's 60 on-chain transactions per user per year. At that rate, all your fancy LN can only support 1.5 million users.
None of your elaborate fantasy constructs of "oh we'll just make it work differently" will work if you refuse to scale AT ANY COST.

CLTv is a protocol feature present that was not implemented. If the nLockTime field was missing from the protocol, CLTv could only have been implemented when the nLockTime was introduced in a hard fork. There is very limited "reserved" space to tack on such extra features in the future.
P2SH is not quite a soft fork. Although old implementations will enter a transaction into the ledger paying out to a script address, old implementations will not process new scripts. So before not a majority of old clients has updated to understand new script features, that feature is of no use for new script features.

You're assuming that not spamming equals to not having a problem. You'll be sadly mistaken. You do have a system at capacity, huge backlogs are the expected result, because use of the capacity is not even (it comes in ebbs and spikes).
The only way you can get away from huge backlogs is to deny actual users use of the system. That's why there's no 3) and why spamming doesn't matter, and why there's only two outcomes of either having scared enough actual users off the blockchain, or not yet having scared enough actual users off the blockchain and getting a huge backlog again.
Rising fees don't fix the problem that there only fit 10 people on the bus. If 20 people want on the bus, the richest 10 get the ticket, and the other 10 don't get any ride at all. Those will stop trying to take the bus altogether.

The lasting value of gold stems from a combination of physics and socioeconomics.
The unassailable properties of gold that give rise to all its other properties are the following:
* Scarce (Gold is not that abundant in earths crust)
* Available enough (Gold is not that scarce that it can hardly be found at all)
* Divisible (Gold is easy to work with, compared to other metals, it's soft and malleable)
* Durable (Gold does not oxidize unlike copper, iron, etc.)
Because these properties are guaranteed, the following properties arise out of its use:
* Fungible (Gold was and is widely accepted across nations, economies and politicial divides as being valuable, regardless of what form it takes)
* Means of exchange (Gold was widely accepted as a means of payment directly, it's only the modern age that somewhat dented that 6000+ year record)
* Source of Liquidity (Gold can easily be exchanged for any other money and currency, and vice versa)
* Store of Value (Gold has retained its value trough its history, and even into the modern age, because see above)
These properties are not as unassailable as Golds physical properties, but they are central to the value of gold to society (and that is what you care about, because a money you can't use is not money). The question though is, why do these properties endure? And the answer is pretty simple: because they can. Socioeconomic fashions rise and wane, but as soon as pressure is relieved off the socioeconomic properties of gold, they reappear organically.
There are alternative candidates to gold, but they are either valued much less, or valued (in the socioeconomic sense) not at all. Reasons for this may include:
* Toxicity
* Radioactivity
* Too brittle, soft or hard or generally difficult to work with
* Too abundant or too scarce
* Too reactive with other elements
* Combustible or easy to oxidize
If gold would not exist, maybe one or another of these would take golds place. But Gold does exist, and outperforms the alternatives.
If you are diminishing the socioeconomic properties of Bitcoin at a protocol level, they cannot arise organically anymore. Bitcoins might still be scarce, durable and divisible. But it is no longer abundant enough, and it certainly will never be fungible, means of exchange or a source of liquidity again. And with that, **it will also cease to be a store of value**.

The regulations aren't the problem. Coming into regulatory compliance isn't the cost item for a growing business. Getting the **license** to operate under the regulation is what's breaking everybodies back. The license costs you around $50m to cover the US alone. You can take a bond on that, but they come with interest rates of around 5%/year. Maintaining the bond would cost you $2.5m/year. And even so, it's an insanely long and frail process that can and does fail most of the time.

LN is just a channel between two participants which trust each other.

* not liable to sudden increases in its base
There are a number of assets that satisfy those properties (precious metals for instance). But what made bitcoin valuable (which is something you care about if you consider it a bearer asset), is that bitcoin added the following properties to good sound money:
* quickly/cheaply transferable
* fits trough the internet
* does not rely on counter party risk
That is the value proposition of bitcoin, and it has been the value proposition that took it from $0 to where it is today. You cannot reasonably expect to fundamentally change the value proposition and take out entire points from it, and expect it'd still be worth much. It's nigh inconceivable for me how you can't realize that you're standing on the precipice of destroying bitcoin...

It isn't a capacity increase because any capacity that it does yield on-chain only stems from the fact that the minimally viable 1mb section part of a SegWit transaction is 1.7x smaller than minimally viable 1mb section only transaction. You cannot make a SegWit transaction without consuming that chunk in the 1mb section. The minimally viable transaction size of 1mb section only transaction is around 250 bytes. The minimally viable 1mb section size of a SegWit transaction is around 150 bytes + more than 100 bytes additional witness data in the 3mb section.
It's a contorted accounting trick that consumes more bandwidth than a straightforward blocksize increase, and it introduces more hardcoded limits (3mb witness data) and arbitrary economic decisions (1mb block data is 4x more costly than 3mb block data).


The max allowed is 1mb "oldschool" section and 3mb SegWit extended data. Sure the SegWit part could be smaller than consuming bytes at a rate of 1:3 against the 1mb section, but it could also not be that favorable (see multisig SegWit transactions).
@_date: 2016-01-24 11:36:08
Assuming todays price and transaction volume of 3tx/s and blocklimit, this means that every on-chain transaction will have to cost $8/tx. With SegWit this will perhaps go down to $2-$4/tx.

Sound money is:
1. a medium of exchange
2. a source of liquidity (easy to use in exchange)
3. a unit of account
4. a store of value
5. fungible
6. divisible
7. durable
8. easy to store
9. scarce
It derives its value from the network effect that these qualities afford. If you do not offer the qualities that define sound money, and no other backing than its utility and network effect exist, then it is not sound money, and will be quite worthless. A money without value cannot function.

You do understand that fast block propagation schemes that reconstruct a block to mine atop of from the data you already have (the broadcast transactions) are a thing? It's been around for a few years now. It's beneficial for a miner to participate in fast block propagation schemes, because the faster their block propagates, the higher the chance is somebody else builds on top of it. Of course a Chinese miner can still stuff his block with manufactured transactions he didn't broadcast, but fast propagation schemes punish that behavior because such blocks will always propagate slower than blocks which include transactions that have been broadcast and are coming from everywhere. No of course you don't, because you don't do brain.
But what exactly are you cheering for? Shooting yourself in the foot because other people have nice shoes? A shitty blockchain nobody can use because you're not happy the Chinese are allowed to mine it? Aparts from that being something stupid to cheer for, you also don't achieve that goal, because limiting blockspace has done nothing to prevent the Chinese from being able provide electricity and electronics for cheap, whodda thunk?

Africa will not leapfrog traditional banking for bitcoin because at 3tx/s affords each person in Africa one transaction every 34 years (assuming nobody else wants to transact). SegWit will only improve this situation by reducing it to 17 years. SegWit + LN will still not improve that situation because 34 years to open/close a channel is completely unworkable as well.
Due to the rising fee market, each transaction in bitcoin is also quickly going to approach and then surpass costs levied by traditional banking system, so for example at $50+/tx costs are going to keep most Africans away as well.

Apparently not as they're doing everything in their power to prevent them. But even if you want them, I've got bad news for you...


It doesn't. It gives you the exact same 1mb block as before + 3mb of extra data that you **only** get to use by also using up space in the 1mb section. Due to predicted format in ideal circumstances this gives you 1.7x more transactions that fit into the 1mb section, but that's it, that's as far as it'll go. And It'll go only that far if everybody starts emitting SegWit transactions (which won't happen) and everybody only used SegWit to make minimally viable transactions (which isn't how most people plan to use SegWit if you believe LN advocates, which is based on multisignature channels, which are significantly bigger than minimally viable transactions).
But even if you buy into that this is a capacity increase (which it isn't), it's only 1.7x capacity increase under ideal circumstances, bought for by using 4x as much bytes as before (which is a really shitty way to "increase" capacity). So if you'd ever actually need more than 1.7x the transaction capacity (because oh I don't know, huge backlogs and rampant demand and willingness to pay for blockspace), you'd land right back at the blocksize debate again. And as history has shown us, it's nearly impossible to resolve.
Do you really think, that going through all that trouble to make Bitcoin completely unusable, and evoking ever more intricate ways to shoot yourself in the foot, is really worth it just to land right back to where we all started this insane journey?

No, I don't disagree with that, because raising the maximum btc would be a relaxation of existing restrictions, and that is not backwards compatible.
What I disagree with is misleading use of "adding new rules". I prefer "introducing new restrictions". It'd be beneficial to not discuss this in terms of soft/hard, and rather just use the traditional "backwards compatible", because that much better describes what's going on.
Backwards compatible changes to a protocol are changes that avoid breaking old implementations. If you don't break old implementations, there is not much new you can introduce.
While extensible protocols can offer some amount of forward compatibility to old implementations, that idea is not compatible with consensus enforcement. In any case, bitcoins protocol and implementations are also not extensible.

Whole premise of article is flawed. Softforks can barely introduce any new feature anybody can rely on. SegWit "softfork" will require everybody to update their software until it is effective (otherwise known as hardfork). Harforks predicated on network consensus aren't the same as a minority hardfork. And lastly:
Neither bitcoin as is, nor bitcoin as will be, nor LN will work at current capacity. SegWit won't be able to increase capacity for years substantially (if ever). In a perpetually congested network, there is no reliable way to either make or receive payments, nor is there a reliable way to open/close a LN channel. And even if you assume the most ideal of circumstances of SegWit, it can only increase capacity by a factor of 2x-4x (depending on interpretation). The network *will* have to hardfork again to bump blocksize, no matter if you get SegWit, and no matter if you think SegWit equates to a stealth hardfork or not.

An excellent point and one I shall use to illustrate how requirements change. Indeed TCP/IP did change trough its history (a lot of small changes, often backwards compatible, but not always, especially in the early days). The biggest change it went trough is the upgrade to IPv6 (which is not really backwards compatible, but does have means and ways to downgrade). IPv6 basically came about because it turns out our assumption about how many internet addresses we'd need where wrong.


I would say that if we did not have IPv6, then the internet could not accomodate much further growth, and it would encourage proliferation of NATs, which is hostile to the free flow of information. So yes, there is potential to stifle progress plenty, luckily we do have IPv6, and it's working, and in time, everybody will migrate to it out of necessity (no matter what IPv4 fundamentalists might say).
You don't come up with perfection and then stick with it. Nothing is ever perfect. Software is never done being written. Sometimes, at points that are up for humans to judge, we need to change. Interpretations on when that might be might differ, but the only constant is change. Refutation of change as an end in itself really is stagnation.

It doesn't. Besides bCore has always taken a stance to not allow "smart money". And even then, your a pitying 4mb statically fixed blocksize cap is in no way adequate to host contracts.


Except when the bad actor is the one you have your channel open to and he simply doesn't route your payment, but other than that, all fine...


That does not solve the centralization issue. This has been the LN design from the beginning, and it never solved the centralization issue. You're talking about a graph with limited capacity edges. Failure modes of "the web" include: no path found, and no path of sufficient capacity found. Both of these will lead to the payment failing, making the web not a feasible construct to transfer payments, because the real-world probability of paths of sufficient capacity existing randomly between two random LN participants is rather low (i.e. in that fashion most payments will simply fail).
Because most payments will fail, it favors central hubs that connect up a large number of people and have dedicated channels between them. In the real world those hubs are known as banks.

Client software which attempts to alter the bitcoin protocol no matter if it's controversial or not is essential to the threat of a software fork.
Software forks is what keeps the maintainers of the incumbent piece of software on their toes.
Censoring protocol/software forking discussions is self-defeating and promotes complacency among maintainers of incumbent software. Complacency leads to a loss of focus, drive, dilution of mission and lack of innovation.

That's the idea of proof of stake. However the swiftness with which such stakes can change hands, and the predictability of what each stake entitles you to, makes proof of stake more prone to even wilder swings in valuation and certainties than bitcoin.
Put another way. If there's a real-world value investment of say $1 billion tied up in mining hardware, no matter what the bitcoin price does momentarily, that investment doesn't move much instantly. It keeps bitcoin secure (at least over the medium term) to the same level no matter what the price gyrations do.
But if a proof of stake based coin gyrates wildly in price, it instantly raises or lowers the stakes for any stakeholder, and equally it raises and lowers the difficulty of attack instantly. So if you can attack the price of a proof of stake based coin in some fashion, you can at the same time attack its security without any delay.

On the surface proof of stake and proof of work might look similar because both propose that an investment (in the stake or the mining hardware) represents a consensus voice about what constitutes a valid block. The idea being that if you have a stake then your incentive is aligned with not screwing the chain.
Both models have the typical attack vector of somebody holding the majority of the stake (or hardware) and thus being able to dictate their rules onto everybody else.
In proof of work, the investment to acquire a voice is tied up in a hardware which is **difficult** to acquire and to liquidate. Although the investment value in hardware does fluctuate with the value of a coin, the second variable it fluctuates with is the network hashrate. This combination of the investment being "tied up" in the real world and the investment value being a function of more than one variable makes the system **resilient**.
In proof of stake the investment to acquire a voice is tied up in the stake which is **easy** to acquire and liquidate. The value of the investment is also only tied to to one variable, the price of a coin. The combination of an easy to move investment in the acquisition of a voice and the voice only being dependent on the price of a coin makes proof of stake **less resillient** than proof of work.
This is a logical conclusion which is well supported by two data points. The first is that proof of work expends real-world resources to provide something, this something it turns out is increased security and resilience. The second is the various states of dysfunction that proof of stake based chains find themselves in.
Although proof of stake might have its uses, it is not a substitute for proof of work.

A collection of large centralized hubs will appear, it says so in the paper itself, and I agree with that assessment. They will appear because practically finding a path between random users will be impossible. It's going to be impossible because either you just don't have any path, or the paths you do have do not have the required capacity.
As we have seen with the traditional banking system, this market dynamic naturally leads to ultimate centralization. The number of banks has declined while the big banks have consolidated and accrued into ever bigger banks. Right now in the US there's only really 2-3 banks that cover 99% of peoples money business. In the future there will only be one. Just as there will only be one LN hub in the future. And I guarantee you, if LN is any success, that hub will belong to "the one bank".

I'm sorry for assuming everybody was sufficiently fluent in the history of the web, so let me explain my analogy.
In the years leading up to to the period of 2001-2004 there was something called "the browser wars", in which several browsers rivaled for market share. It wasn't just about who got to have their software run on users machines, but also about what kind of content got made for the Web. Each browser maker introduced features that its competitors where not supporting, and tried to sway website makers to produce content that only properly ran on their browser.
This war went on for a while, but eventually (latest by 2004) Microsoft prevailed and was widely declared "the winner of the browser wars" culminating in Internet Explorer 6. No other competitor had the wherewithal (engineering resources, marketing budget, etc.) to challenge Microsofts position. Essentially everybody was now forced to produce content that was compatible with Internet Explorer, and the remainder of alternative browsers had such a low market share that the effort spent to support cool new custom features was a waste of time.
What followed after the browser wars is a classic example of what happens when one party/cabal monopolizes an ecosystem. Internet Explorer 6 (introduced in 2001) was not updated with any substantial new feature for 5 years. You have to understand that just a few years after its introduction, the web was essentially blocked from making any progress because of that. The time around 2001 and 2006 is known to web makers as the "IE dark ages".
So by controlling "the one implementation" and being the ultimate arbiter of what it does, Microsoft did great harm to the Web. But the story is not without a light at the end of the tunnel, although Microsoft "won the browser wars", this position was soon to be challenged by alternative browsers like Firefox (and later Chrome). These browsers had substantial difficulty to gain any traction at first (and they where widely ridiculed by tech pundits and analysts as "never going anywhere"), because they had no feature parity with Internet Explorer 6. But over time, they acquired that parity, and grew their market share simply by being friendlier to the user in one or another regard.
And then the alternative browsers started to add new features not supported by Internet Explorer. At first, still nobody could afford to target those features, so the web still did not move forward. But eventually, trough excellence of implementation, and because Microsoft had still not updated its own browser, the alternative browsers started to gain ground and it soon became a justifiable effort for web makers, to start targeting those new features.
This brings to the present age, which can be understood to be somewhat of a renaissance of the web. Because after its dark age, and after overcoming the static resting mass of all the people using Internet Explorer, the web started to move forward again in the period since 2009-2010, and new features have been added to it at a rapid pace.
More features where added to the web in the period of 2009-2016 (7 years) than where added in the entire preceeding history of of the web since its inception in 1989 (27 years ago).
Microsoft did eventually update its browser in 2006 (with Internet Explorer 7). But they only did so after losing a substantial portion of their market share. At its peak (between 2002 2004) Internet Explorer ran around 90%-99% of peoples machines (whomever you ask). But just a few years later it had dropped significantly and they where forced to stop sitting on their hands and do something.
So the lesson of the story: It is bad if one party/cabal/company monopolizes a protocol/ecosystem with "the one implementation". And it's vitally important for an ecosystem to have a heterogeneous variety of implementations, that are not only merely following "the one implementation", but also challenge the consensus about "what can be done". It's only that which saved the world from an eternal Internet Explorer 6 web.
The future will tell if we get into that situation again (and we might), but we know how to cure it now, and that's a very important thing to learn. And it doesn't just apply to the web.

See the [lightning whitepaper]( Section 8.4 "Payment Routing":


(e.g. BGP, Cjdns). Eventually, with optimizations, the network will look a lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs. Similar to how packets still reach their destination on your home network connection, not all participants need to have a full routing table. The core Tier-1 routes can be online all the time —while nodes at the edges, such as average users, would be connected intermittently
If it wasn't obvious for those versed in network topology, randomly creating LN channels does not mean you can send payments between random users. In order for a payment to reach a destination, there has to be a path from source to destination (where each link is payment channel) with sufficient capacity to carry the payment, as well as sufficient commitment to make it a feasible route.
In theory you might be connected by 7-hops to Kevin Bacon, but that does not mean that the 6 intervening connections would help put you in contact with Kevin Bacon.
This problem has been realized in financial system a long time ago. The traditional fashion to transfer wealth from one individual to another was to give somebody else physically a piece of commodity. This is impractical in a number of situations, so a practical alternative is to establish a system of credit between institutions that manage peoples wealth. Where a payment can be initiated at "the edge of the network" i.e. the interface you have with your bank (your banks physical location, e-banking, etc.) and the payment is routed trough an internal network of credit and settlement layers banks have negotiated among themselves to get your payment to the recipient.
That is essentially where LN is heading. It automates some parts of that process, and makes it less dependent on debt, but it makes it no less susceptible to control, centralization, star-like networks, monopolies etc. I.e. it will mirror the traditional banking system with all its flaws and foibles.

Let's make this simple thought experiment: If the difficulty was 100 and one would be able to mine thousands of bitcoins using a few hours of computing effort and a few cents worth of energy. Would you pay 10$ for a bitcoin?
Obviously not, you wouldn't pay 10$ for a bitcoin, and whoever tried to sell his 10$ bitcoin would be vastly underbid by other sellers willing to take less profit.
If difficulty was 1000x higher then it is now, and it would cost 10k$ to produce a single bitcoin. Would you expect anybody to sell you a bitcoin for 10$? Obviously not, you may not be willing to buy one at all. But equally likely nobody's going to sell you a freshly minted bitcoin for 10$. It would be the equivalent of making a gift to you worth 10k$.
Now between those (or some) extremes there's obviously room to play, introduced by the fact that there is substantial amounts of bitcoins around, and that difficulty varies and that there is speculation on markets.
But the raw fundamentals don't change. 
Now the obvious question is, what's the value of a bitcoin when they've become an inifintely rare commodity (that is not obtainable anymore at all)? The question is quite simple, and this is a core concept of bitcoin. Bitcoin use a two-phase bootstrap to build up value. The first step in this bootstrap is the planned deflation (weather that be blocksize of difficulty) that ensures there is a certain fundamental price expecation. The second step is that once there are no more bitcoins, there will be even more (and stable) deflation, because it will essentially express the growth of the bitcoin economy as a whole.

Here's an alternative idea. A little flash ram and a few bits of logic cost about 1$ to produce. Make a literal "wallet" with a button and a small lcd to show the receiving address and amount on top to authorize a transaction. The private keys never leave that dongle, just the signed transactions do. The bitcoin software asks this wallet and the user has to authorize it physically.

Oh I bungled that one, it's corrected.


It does matter for the miners who stay *in* the business, because their piece of the pie gets bigger :)




I think that is wrong for a few simple reasons.
Supply geometry
* Do you agree that when the price rises to very profitable levels, that the influx of coins (both from stashes and freshly mined) increases?
* If you do agree to the above, by necessity of geometric logic you need to agree that the influx ceases when prices fall.
Demand Geometry
* Do you agree that when prices fall, the amount of btcs demanded scales up (both because they cost less and because people see a cheap price)?
* If you agree to the above by necessity of geometric logic you have to agree that demand ceases when prices reach certain levels (mostly psychological, like say, 30$)
* You also have to agree that demand increases the lower the price.
Excess geometry
* Do you agree that even very inept miners will not sell 100% of their coins when prices are below their operation cost just to stay running?
* If you agree to the above then you need to agree to the fact that when prices are low, **no excess coins enter the market whatsoever** neither from stashes nor freshly minted.
Difficulty/Ask geometry
* Do you agree that miners are going to ask for higher prices when the difficulty increases?
* If you agree to the above, you will also agree that miners will settle for smaller prices if difficulty decreases.
So in a nutshell:
* a rising difficulty level does increase the coin influx cessation level
* sinking difficulty level decreases the coin influx cessation level
* if influx ceases even light demand can drive prices up
* if difficulty decreases hereterfore unprofitable mining can become profitable again
* if price undercuts mining profitability then there will be a miners washout as well as miners staying on betting on longer term profits
The bottom line is, short of completely crashing the whole system absolutely beyond recoverability, forever and all eternity, you cannot prevent it from rebalancing itself and giving miners an incentive to mine again.

Like I state in the parent, the system can be interpreted in two ways, such that either difficulty affects price, or price affects difficulty. I don't think there's any "truth" to be found for either. They're both affected by each other (and I state both possibilities as possibilities).
Clearly there is a relationship between price and mining activity, since price does affect miner profitability, and profitability effects mining activity.
Conversly I also state that markets are not inherently supply or demand driven only. A market only exists in context of asks meeting bids. If either side of the market dominates for a while, the other side gets stronger (a lowering price increases bitcoin volume buying power, and a higher price gives incentive to realize profits).
I do not deviate from the position that the labor theory of value, which is what miners live&amp;die by, is a major driver of supply. You falsely introduce the equivalency of production at a constant rate with the will to immediately sell at that price. If the price is favorable, more selling will happen, if it is not, less selling will happen, except of course for old stashes and panic reactions.
However I also stated that old-stashes supply is strictly limited (albeit substantial), and as such it is a dwindling influence both because it depletes, and is slowly offset by freshly mined coins.
The view that the asks are irrelevant and only the bids is flawed. You're essentially arguing that you'll not find buyers, but always find sellers. I could as well argue that you'll always find buyers, but not always find sellers. The truth, yet again is something inbetween.
Again, as stated in the parent, there's a variety of market influences, most of which are long-term neutral. The neutral ones are speculation and trade against goods, because for every sold or bought coin, there's an equal likelyhood that it'll be bought back or liquidated later on. However new coins introduced by miners have less chance of being bought back by themselves, they're essentially the real driver of inflation. 
Therefore it is important to understand when fresh coins will swamp the market, and when they will not. And unlike speculation and trade of goods, fresh coins entering the market have a rigidly fundamental calculation behind them which favors certain kinds of behaviors, while it punishes others. Among those it favors is selling coins at a profit, and among those it punishes is selling coins at a loss. A miner who sells at a loss will soon cease to be any influence at all, and a miner who manages to sell at a profit is essentially a **deflationary** influence **if** difficulty rises.

And even if not the same money, then the transaction volume over time makes it fairly obvious.

I fully agree, everybody should stop mining...
And I'll just mine all for myself when the difficulty drops to rock bottom, thank you very much :)
So all such predictors cannot take into account that profitability, difficulty and price are self-balancing functions eventually. Here's how they work:
* Price might follow difficulty (because a raised difficulty induces miners to ask for more $ per bitcoin)
* Difficulty might follow price (because a lowered price induces miners to stop mining)
* Between those possiblities difficulty and price will adjust to each other.
The following matrix is the difficulty equilibrium.
                     | Difficulty holds                 | Difficulty goes up                | Difficulty goes down
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Price holds      | mining is profitable,            | mining becomes less profitable    | mining becomes more profitable
                     | miners keep mining.              | miners stop mining                | miners start mining
                     | difficulty holds                 | difficulty goes down              | difficulty goes up
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Price goes up    | mining becomes more profitable   | mining is profitable              | mining becomes more profitable
                     | miners start mining,             | miners keep mining                | miners start mining
                     | difficulty goes up               | difficulty holds                  | difficulty goes up
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Price goes down  | mining becomes less profitable   | mining becomes less profitable    | mining is profitable
                     | miners stop mining               | miners stop mining                | miners keep mining
                     | difficulty goes down             | difficulty goes down              | difficulty holds
The next matrix is the price equilibrium
                      | Difficulty holds                 | Difficulty goes up                | Difficulty goes down
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Price holds      | mining is profitable,            | mining becomes less profitable    | mining becomes more profitable
                      | miners sell normally.            | miners stop selling               | miners sell more
                      | price goes holds                 | price goes up                     | price goes down
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Price goes up    | mining becomes more profitable   | mining is profitable              | mining becomes more profitable
                      | miners sell more                 | miners sell normally              | miners sell more
                      | price goes down                  | price holds                       | price goes down
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Price goes down  | mining becomes less profitable   | mining becomes less profitable    | mining is profitable
                      | miners stop selling              | miners stop selling               | miners sell normally
                      | price goes up                    | price goes up                     | price holds
Both equilibria are more or less likely. A key point where they differ is that:
* Price can react quite quickly
* Difficulty reacts with delay, and the buildup/teardown of mining capacity is slow.
It has been shown that historically difficulty is not adjusting down much, which confirms the "sticky difficulty" theory. It has also been shown historically that price varies in volatility quite a lot but stays roughly in an exponential (with difficulty) standard deviation channel.
Mining (due to it's stickyness) may suffer periods in which price does not confirm difficulty. However it also enjoys periods where price **does** confirm difficulty.
Moreover the relation of price and difficulty indicates that there is an oscillatory relationship of these. That means profitability of mining osculates between lows and highs (we're currently in a low). The typical "high" is on the order of 4x more profitable then the current low (which approaches unprofitable but hovers just above it).
If history is any indication (and it might not be, however I think that's unlikely because of the intertwined relationship presented in the matrices above), then another it a roughly 4-month frequency of the profitability oscillation. We're currently 1 month into the low of the wave, so a maximum profitability may be approaching in another 2-3 months.

I am aware that there's varying prices for sellers based on when they started to mine. But you should also be aware that old stashes of coins are no infinite source. They are a strictly limited source of coins.
2/3 of the coins have yet to be mined, and 2/3 of the current capacity entered the market in the last 4 weeks. This means a couple of things:
* The main resistance in price is old-stashes profit taking
* The action of profit-taking depletes the old stashes
* The newly installed miners (whether that be by old hands or newbies) plays by the same rules, not by the large time-differential rules.
These factors that you play at to keep price down, they are not static. The resistance will crumble, and the support will rise, until that reverses again for a round of stash depletion. The very dynamic that you can easily observe right now (the historical profitability, prices and difficulty) are fully determined by these cycles of miner buildup, price hype, price collapse, miner washout, stash depletion, resistance breakdown, and back to the start. This is the essence of cyclic markets.

The comparision between housing and bitcoins has a flaw. I'll illustrate it with tulip onions.
Tulip onions have a use (people like to see pretty flowers). Ultimately the price of a tulip onion is determined by how much people are prepared to pay to own a pretty flower. There's a certain range to that calculation, say anything between 1$ to 100$. But it's pretty obvious that if a flower costs 10'000$ it's way overpriced.
Now speculation may drive that price up beyond reasonability, but it'll dawn on even the most stupid investor that there's a price that's in no way related to the reality (of the larger flower market).
Housing, similarly, has such underlying value calculations. Say Family housing should orient itself more or less in how much it costs to build such a house, and what kind of income a family has. If a house costs 1.5x of that we're in a trading range. If it costs 10x to 100x, it's disconnected from reality. Cheap mortgages to irresponsible conditions by banks sadly kept the housing bubble rising far beyond such reasonable calculations, and this was ultimately corrected.
Bitcoins have no intrinistic useful value. They're actually quite worthless in themselves. They don't look pretty, you can't live in them, and there's no kind of lifestyle that requires them.
There's essentially no hard point in bitcoin pricing where you can say with any certainty that they're over or under-priced.
This presents a sort of problem of course. How do you valuate a commodity that has no practical use?
Lacking any other way to valuate it, the simplest valuation is how hard it is to get a bitcoin. Hardware amortization and energy cost at current difficulty put the production price of one bitcoin at the moment around 10$.
Since a major fraction of the sellers (the miners) are acutely aware of that cost (after all, they do mine), it means supply is neither constant nor especially deep when prices do not do what miners think fair. In essence the supply of coins will run dry (barring panics and other market inefficiencies).
Now I've shown that lacking a real market valuation of bitcoins, there is a well recognized supply/demand mechanic that will automatically limit supply should mining become unprofitable, of course one could now ask the valid question: Why does the difficulty not adjust? It's a fair question, and the answer is thus:
Difficulty is very slow to adjust, it takes many months for it to react (since hardware acquisition and selloff are necessarily slow business). During that time the exchange price is a moving target, it may be low some weeks, but insanely high others. Between difficulty and price, price is definitly more quickly moving, faster to adapt and more fuzzy. Difficulty is positively momentous, slow in changing and unlikely to budge to any momentary fad in pricing.
That is why difficulty tends to give pricing a certain basis valuation, and only if price can stay out of sync with mining consistently for a long time (many months) can it expect to move difficulty.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:41:01
You'll have to look at the problem from the perspective of a miner. "Better price" is either less difficulty or higher price. "Better" for a miner is always a relation to difficulty.

In all fairness, ATIs integer operations optimization is completely worthless drivel. In reality you simply don't need that for 3D apps and you don't need it for most of scientific computing (which is really hot on double performance).
That's pretty much why you can buy scientific computing and renderfarm servers from nvidia, and nobody's much interested to offer that for ATI.
So yeah, I do expect ATI to learn from that mistake and do a product the market actually wants. Of course, bitcoin does not count as "market" just yet, so no luck there :)

It's never the sunshine rainbow version nor is it the doom&amp;gloom version.
Nevertheless as you say yourself, there is some substantial upwards potential (which I personally don't rate too significant) as well as some substantial (but limited) downwards potential.
Yeah I don't think the "oh I forgot my wallet" crowd is, economically, too big of an influence.
Supply is not growing, this is a common misconception. The rate of new supply over time constant. What is not constant is how much people expect to get in return for providing this supply. And there are two models of thinking about it:
* They value their stash (built from mining) and their ongoing influx at current market prices. That is: It doesn't matter for them mentally that they got a ton of bitcoins on the cheap in the past, they calculate their cost for them just the same as if they'd mined them right now. A rationale for this point of view is: If a miner where to obtain the same amount of coins (by mining) again that he just sold, he'd have to factor in that he'd have to deal with the (current and future) increased difficulty.
* Miners carefully keep book how many coins they mined at which time for how many investment, and they compartmentalize it in some 30 or 50 compartments and value it individually. I don't think this model has much merit, nor is it easy to apply, so I don't think it's likely miners think that way.
Increasing difficulty *does* mean increased price expectation of the parties holding the biggest stashes (miners), because miners think in difficulty over $. If the market is not meeting that price expectation of the miners, then a lot of them will not sell. This is what I refer to when I say lowering prices and rising difficulty will run supply dry.
It's true that demand has to keep up. However demand only has to keep up with the supply offered. If the supply dries out, then there is a surplus of demand, of which only a fraction will be satisfied and the price goes up, this is known as "meltup" because a small volume drives the price up.
Yes "crashing" prices at high volume can happen. But look at your quoted BAC example. They came down from 60$ to 10$ in two years. This is not what you commonly refer to as crash. Because by the time you lost 15% on BAC, it was pretty much clear that the JIG was up, and just in case you missed it, oh, the whole economy was going down the drain...
Now a Crash as in real bad, as in 95% of the value wiped out, that's what you get when you can't find any buyers anymore at all. That's referred to as liquidity crunch, which usually happens into a firesale. These are low-volume affairs (because few parties find acceptable contracts), and you refer to them as meltdowns. We have not seen such a thing yet.
And while we're on technicals, bitcoins troughout the recennt (+1y) history has had a big volatility, and the current manias and panics are absolutely normal variations. If you draw a standard-deviation channel over your logarithmic price, you will see that we have both substantial up and downsides at current prices before we're falling out of quite an established price channel.

And yes, you would buy hardware marked down 50% from retail price. Hardware I'd have gotten 15% new below retail price. So I only need to recover 35% to cover my risk in hardware and can have a reasonable expectation not to make a loss on the hardware.

A better price (for a miner, since that is what **all** the discussion is about, see parent and post topic), is when difficulty fell faster then price, or if price rose faster then difficulty.
you're also accusing me of constructing a tautology, which is, strictly speaking true, but unfortunately you already forgot again that we're talking about a system over time, which does not inhabit the same state at once. It inhabits one state at a time and then it shifts to another somewhere along the number of possible states. Since each attribute of the system (difficulty and price) carry their own rules and momentum, oscillations and overshoots happen which are later over-corrected for and so on.

Thank you, you've just proven that you finally understand the relationship between incentive, price and difficulty, and that those are not disconnected, independent systems, and that one influences the other. After you've refuted your own invalid argument, is there anything you'll want to add?

That is well put. Sure wallet.dat theft is an issue. But it's not an issue say like, sha256 gets broken tomorrow. It's a minor inconvenience that bitcoin clients have lax wallet.dat security right now, an inconvenience that is likely to be fixed soon in a satisfactory fashion. So yeah, markets shouldn't worry about it that much, it isn't casting doubt at the bitcoin system at its core.
P.S. I'm a programmer, too, I know that providing adequate security in the client for the wallet.dat would not be such a big deal. But I also understand that there are a bunch of issues that are more important right now to get right, so please have a bit of patience with the Devs, they're on the case.

Difficulty relates to how many coins where mined over what timeframe and adjusts to keep the rate of 1 block every 10 minutes. If more people mine, difficulty goes up, if less people mine, difficulty goes down.
@_date: 2011-07-05 21:12:56
If I'd have meant "higher price" I'd have written "higher price", yet I wrote "better price", which is entirely valid. But I'm glad you went of another rampage to find irrelevant inconsistency in phrasology of mine instead of simply accepting that my conclusion is sound.
@_date: 2011-06-30 22:24:54
You don't seem to realize that right now it costs about 10$ to produce a single bitcoin.

@_date: 2011-07-02 07:03:42
The issue is the following: A sell order for 0.47btc should have executed high, not low. This is because the standing buy orders close below 15$ should have caught it long before a buy order @ 2.99$ would've been executed.
That being said, we're going to panic now about 0.47btc. Really? Some matchmaking bug caused two orders to meet where they should not have, and you're all panic wombats again.
@_date: 2011-07-06 08:32:22
The answer you seek is fully present in the comment thread would you care to read it, further elaboration about the mechanics of upwards price pressure by raised price expecation is fully unnecessary.
Conversly, you may state your case why you think upwards ask-pressure is irrelevant, that you assume you'll find an ask to whatever price you bid for, no matter how ridiculous or far from the economic reality it is, and how you'll operate a market that has only bidders and no askers. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:31:40
Oh one other thing, there seems to be a prevalent assumption that only demand determines the market. This is patently false. Each market lives by demand AND **supply**. By bid AND **ask**. Ignoring one side of a market and claim it as all there is, to that market, is obviously extremely wrong.
That point is easy to illustrate by the following tought experiment. Suppose there would be 0 ask volume. Would there be a market at any kind of of bid price and volume? No. No ask, no market. No bid, no market. bid+ask = market.
@_date: 2011-07-05 06:51:16
Your critique is weak because:
**Argumentative Fallacies**
* You commit an [argument from fallacy]( "If the labor theory of value is wrong, then so must be my conclusion.". This is not necessarily true and does not support your argument.
* You commit an [inconsistent comparison]( and false equivalency: "Because sand does not conform to the labor theory of value, therefore bitcoin does neither". It should be pretty obvious that sand and bitcoins work very differently.
* You commit a [red herring]( Instead of discussing the argument based on its merits partaining to bitcoin, you introduce sand as a false equivalency to support your position.
* You commit an appeal to controversy: "Because the labor theory of value is criticized it must be false"
**Premises are invalid**
Your whole debunkment bases itself on two core premises.
* First Premise: The labor theory of value is wrong
* Second Premise: Because the price of sand is not based on the labor involved in creating it by hand, therefore Bitcoins value cannot be derived by the process that creates them.
**First Premise: The Labor Theory of value**
The labor theory of value may be more or less applicable depending on the field of economics, the market and the political situation. It may have undesirable attributes when applied. Nevertheless, you present no valid reason why it should not apply. I named the reasons why it should apply, and I will gladly do so again.
**Second Premise: Sand is like Bitcoin**
You introduce a false equivalency by comparing Bitcoin mining to producing sand with handpicks and hammers.
This line of reasoning is flawed because there are cheaper sources of sand then producing it that particular way. For instance, you could find natural sand on beaches, deserts and sand-mines. Or you could introduce machinery that is more efficient at crushing rocks to sand and so on.
Bitcoin on the other hand cannot be found at beaches, or in mines. And the method to obtain bitcoins cannot simply be made more efficient. Therefore, to put your analogy in the right context; Bitcoin can **only** be obtained by using handpicks and hammers. That's the only way there is.
Since both of your argumentative premises are invalid both from a factual and an argumentative point of view are false, your conclusion that my conclusion is wrong is false, which does not mean that my conclusion is correct, but it certainly implies that your critique is without merit.
@_date: 2011-06-17 17:24:23
Congratulations, you just did an analysis and you do trust your fundamentals. So since you have quite a pessimistic outlook, I'd invite you to sit back and wait for the big plunge and load up whe they're cheap.

you're not going to sell mining rigs. You sell each part individually. People don't value assortments of hardware as highly as they rate individual items.
Additionally, it helps if you can get relatively recent hardware, since that will not become completely worthless (like second, second hand from before 3 generations ago) in a very quick time. And while you're on it getting wholesaler discounts (up to 15%) you need to consider that you also hold waranty (36months) on the hardware, which can drive secondhand prices up a bit.
Also keep in mind that you don't have to amortize the hardware at profit by resale entirely. You should have a plan in place to amortize a portion of the hardware by sale of bitcoin incrementally, so you can absorb a lowered resale value.
So in short, if you're not a complete idiot, you can absolutely profitably sell used hardware.


I've gotten 15% of my hardware investment back in 7 days. You're doing it wrong.

Transactions need to be written into new blocks. A block is essentially nothing else then a commit to the longest chain of transactions. That is why transactions get processed every 10 minutes.
Yes once you can't give yourself 50btc for every block you mined, miners will have to live off transaction fees.
If everybody would stop mining at that point, nobody could get any transactions processed. Luckily, difficulty would go down then. The cost of mining, difficulty and the earnings out of transaction fees will self-balance.
@_date: 2011-06-17 18:19:42
Yay for you then. Of course prices where never at 42$, so that's a bunch of BS, but nevermind.

That the behavior of participants in a market cannot be described in terms of linear-systems. Nonlinear integral terms can describe market-behavior, and by approximating those (by means of simulation and sampling) a particular theory can be tested.
Markets are much more like navier-stokes fluid simulations or global illumination then they are like a car accelerating under constant accelleration.
The reason for this is because markets are a phenomenon where many "automaton" or particles interact according to a set of "rules" and the current valuation of the market expresses the state of the global system at one point in time, whereas the behavior of the system is defined over time by the integration of said rules.
@_date: 2011-07-01 16:03:07
No you're entirely right, difficulty is happy to go upwards but sticky to go downwards.
@_date: 2011-07-05 21:02:44
I'm surprised it's not quite obvious that you can't arrive at a deterministic and linear equation model of market behavior.
For instance, you might make the simple linear system saying that: ask volume is proportional to price and bid is inverse proportional to price. This would be a very limited system, that would fail as often as it would succeed. The question would be: why does it fail?
Obviously there is more factors to consider then simple price action to determine price. For instance, price is irrelevant if the purchase power is exhausted or if the supply is exhausted. If either can't meet the demand of price for volumina, the system breaks.
What determines purchase power and supply? A simple system would be to say that supply is constant as well as money influx into mtgox is. But obviously you've not gained anything by that, since it's a neutral influence, yet your previous linear system still fails.
So neither purchase power nor supply is constant, and if it isn't constant, what introduces variations?
Popularity is one effect that introduces purchase power and the will to sell at some price combined with the capability to sell introduce supply.
That's where things get rather tricky, because popularity induces the price to move upwards, it might introduce more popularity. This leads to a second order derivative where the result of one factor depends on recursively on other factors that are influenced by the result.
The behavior of a system where the input is a function of the output is an integral. Such systems may be modelled as an interpolated/sampling linear equation.
A great deal of effort has been expended to arrive at pricing functions and market-theory. There is no end-result in sight to this effort, and I don't expect there to be one. It would be extremely ill-fated to even attempt to arrive at any kind of predictive statement, since not only is the market non-linear, it is also self-similar and chaotic. Yet, we engage in markets, and hence we have to arrive at some underlying understanding of how it might work fundamentally. It is not difficulty for a human to grasp the effect of an integral system (at least the simpler ones). Yet it would (even for a computer) be quite difficulty to arrive at a precise answer, even more so since markets are essentially "fuzzy" (i.e. wetware driven).
So any relationship that is discernible may serve as a factor to influence your own estimations of probabilities if your bets are going to work out or not. And that they are going to work out, or not, is very much neither predictable, refutable, provable or otherwise deterministic. They'll work or they don't, and all you can do is trying to put yourself on the right side of the probability.

Eventually ASICs will probably take over mining. That is not today or tomorrow however. The cost of mining hardware has two components:
* MH/kWh, that his how much energy is consumed (that costs money) in order to provide that kind of power.
* MH/system/$, that is how much it costs to aquisition the hardware.
Right now GPU mining (depending on your energy cost of course) incurs between 10% - 30% of its cost in energy consumption. The rate is at about 1.14mh/kWh.
Hardware aquisition cost makes up the rest, as it takes roughly 1000$ to provide one GH of hashing performance. (so roughly 1mh/$).
Allowing for some investment strategies and energy payoff at current prices and difficulty, and factoring in price uncertainty and possibly rising difficulty you will need anything between 3 to 12 months to amortize said hardware.
ASICs have a serious energy advantage, but they are vastly more expensive to provide. The factors (at a guess) for ASICs look something like that.
* 10mh/kWh (as opposed to about 1.1mh/kWh), i.e. something like 10x more energy efficient then GPUs.
* 0.05mh/system/$ (as opposed to about 1mh/system/$), i.e. something like 20x more expensive to aquire then GPUs (that guesstimate is factoring in the fact that this hardware is not commoditized right now, and the development, boot and production cost is huge for small-batch customized hardware).
The killer that's holding ASICs hardware back is that it would take around 5 to 20 years to amortize the hardware (shaving off maybe 6 months to 2 years because of saved energy).
Unless ASICs miners become vastly cheaper, they're just about irrelevant in the larger picture.

It's a peculiar way to look at it, but what you refer to is a "roque chain". The theory goes like this: If somebody malicious amassed enough computers to start a roque-chain that overtook the longest legit chain, he could credit himself with blocks he hasn't really found. There's only two issues with that:
* You'll need quite a lot of computing power under your direct undeterred control to do it.
* Blocks are easy to verify for correctness of having been hashed against the difficulty. There is zero incentive for a legitimate bitcoin client to deal with clients that accept a roque chain, because you're essentially just pissing down your coins a black hole that'd likely vanish as soon as your coins are in it.

You're a panic wombat. Let me introduce you to a couple of core concepts when giving opinions about markets.
* You do not have a crystal ball. And if you had, you wouldn't peddle it on reddit.
* The past is is the past, and the future is the future, those do not necessarily correlate. People've been layering similar looking charts over each other since people invented charts. So far it has prevented nobody from pulling completely irrelevant opinions out of their arse.
* The internet is littered, no really, filled with price prophets. On average, they have a probability of being 50% right every time they open their piehole. The rest of the time they fake it (a long list of lovely strategies are available there).
* People like to be right about something. Especially price prophets, they looooove to be right. Well, tough truth buddy. You're going to be wrong more often then right. Most of the time you're going to be wrong. Being successful in markets has nothing to do with being right or predicting something. It's got to do with carefully weighting probabilities against risk and having strategies to deal with entry and exit.
Every hedge fund has a division of chartists, and they don't produce as much (or any) alpha as their strategists and HFT divisions. Please don't fall into the trap that you could pull two unrelated charts, over different timeframes, from different situations, with a different tradership, of different instruments and think it means anything. It doesn't.
So please shove your technicals crystal ball, whatever you think it predicts. If you want to get into the business of prophecy, you should join Harold Camping. You're just a chart-artist, go do something that produces alpha.

So we're talking about the miner exodus happening in a couple weeks (people've been peddling that theory for nearly a year now, though never mind). Alright I'm game, watcha gonna do, difficulty keeps rising trough the roof, prices keep falling, the riders of the apokalypse roam the street and the dead rise from their graves. Here's a couple tips to survive the "inevitable" bitcoincalypse.
* If people are abandoning mining en masse, stay your course. Difficulty will decrease and your profits will increase. The guy with the longest staying power has won.
* You're suddenly finding yourself in a hardware sellers market for a couple weeks or a month. Do **not** try to sell your hardware, in fact, laugh it in the face and load up on cheap hardware you got at 90% markdowns from retail. Because you can be sure that firstly it'll be excelent bitcoin mining gear (hence it can recover some coast soon s you have it) and second, the hardware sellers market will eventually blow over, and you can start selling your goods at 30% markdown and you'll make 200% profit.
* Don't sell your coins on a whim, because at the rates they'll be going by that time you'd be shooting yourself in the foot. Instead write off the negible value they still posses and just sit on them for a couple years, you never know what's gonna happen.

You commit (classically) to to another two wonderful fallacies:
* You engage in a weak form of the time honed [Ad hominem]( attack, in effect criticizing my form of argument rather then its particular merits. That particular fallacy is called "Style over substance fallacy".
* You then flawlessly execute the the guilt by association fallacy that states because I present my argument in the form that I do, that my argument is false (as opposed to being right).
Naturally you do not have anything of value to add to the argument (presumably because you can't) and it is quite obvious that it has ended here. Thank you for ceding victory of the argument so easily, it only took one well formed response to prove your critique without merit.
I would have hoped at least for a cohesive reasoning as to why the labor theory of value does not apply to bitcoin (not involving false equivalencies like sand), or some amusing attempt to defend your theory of sand pricing where you try to show that you can buy sand below the lowest mining/storage/transport/distribution cost from a sand supplier. But you can't have everything eh?

Not this, again? Really, do we never tire of this? Everytime profitability is down we'll get swamped with whiners who "call it quits" or advise everybody to "just fucking stop, you're stupid" or outright refuse to reason in any coherent fashion about it.
Conversely everytime profitability is up, we get swamped in posts telling you "oh mining is the next big thing!" or "If you're not mining right now, here's why you should!!!"
Ohright, I forgot, this is reddit and it's markets. Deary me, who am I to proclaim that any of that hype and hysteria is complete utter nonesense, and that sentiments borne out of short term price developments are naturally flawed when applied to a long-tem activity.

I have bunch on the line, but nothing I'm not willing to write off. 
A volatility of 66% in a few days is a lot, that is true. But if you look at historical bitcoin volatility, it *is* absolutely normal. Anybody who did not expect this after the meteoric rise is a fool (I did expect it, and I spend 4x more buying in at 8$ and 10$ then I spend trying to grabing the movement while it went up above 16$, didn't you?) 
So yeah, I'm telling you not panic for as long as something does not drop out of its standard deviation channel. There's plenty of time to panic when that happens, and that is not yet. And even so, by the time *you* panic and everybody sells, I'll be eagerly looking forward to buy tens of thousands of btc on the cheap, so bring it on, please, with sugar on top :)
Batshit crazy is expecting sudden stability at record prices and volumes and then crying your eyes out when your pipe-dream did not happen. Get real, this is the markets, and they're quite ruthless, get used to it or get out.

First the money laundering issues: Yes juristiction of money laundering might stop somewhere, that much is true. But this is equally true for USD operated businesses. Second even tough you might not have juristiction to query as to the identity of exchanging parties, you can still freely follow the trail by its transaction log. A quality not present in USD exchanges.
And yes, the real issues for the consumer are the reversibility of exchange as well as that they have to keep their wallet secure. Thankfully these are issues that can be solved by a marketplace of escrow and banking services, which can compete for customers to hold their assets secure and provide the same qualities that CC/Paypal have for payer protection on Bitcoin.

Keep in mind tough that this will only seek long-term equilibrium. The mining/price relationship can very well breakdown (easpecially in short terms), and then the question's only weather miners will give up, and difficulty eases, or if the price gets pushed up.
Personally I find it more likely that price'll be pushed up, since mining can't react as fast to changed prices. But we'll see :)

I'm just tired of the eternal hypes and panics that're incited for no apparent reason then that people have made investment decisions they can't stand behind, and instead of simply scuttling it and learning from it, they feel entitled to go moan on reddit about it, in the Nth repost of the same sentiment over, and over and over again.
We will see many more of these eternal reposts where they will take essentially one of two forms depending on where difficulty and price are at any given moment, they'll sound:
* Omg it's all not worth it and I lost a bunch, don't do this folks!
* Omg I missed the bandwagon and now I can't get in anymore and others make such fabulous profits.
Some of the time you'll see those eternal reposts even at the same time, and some of the time you'll only see one.
Fact is people come here for psychotherapy after having made decisions they regret (not investing early&amp;big enough, or investing too big too late).
There's three magic concepts that differentiates that kind of loosing from the other kind of fabulous profits.

Maybe, maybe not. I don't have a crystal ball. The artist with the charts doesn't have one.

Of course price doesn't exactly follow difficulty or the other way around. But that's the fun of non-linear systems, they don't behave linearly, that doesn't make them entirely unpredictable or unstable either :)
@_date: 2011-06-17 16:44:07
That is correct. But like I said, the individuals  (which is what you're dealing with when you're looking for a trade) are having earnings expectations based on their operational costs and risks. This earnings expectation rises when difficulty rises.
@_date: 2011-06-17 15:25:50
You know, that's exactly what I mean. You're pushing panic here because the price came down after a good high. Just a wee bit over 2 weeks ago it was at 8$/btc and now you're calling it an apocalypse because it plunged down to 15$? Really?
Now go study exponential standard deviation channels and you'll see that you can't reasonably panic until it falls below 3$. So FFS, chill man. If you're *that* pessimistic, just lie in wait for the big plunge and then buy yourself silly and you'll be a freshly minted bitcoinionaire.

And I should just take your word for it, no rationale whatsoever, you say so right?
Let's see:
* Bitcoin is a commodity because it requires scarce real world resources to produce (electricity and computing power).
* Bitcoin is a currency because it can be freely exchanged.
* Bitcoin is an equity because it stands in for a share in the future of this exciting system.


That one is easy to deconstruct. The value of a currency in exchange is *entirely* determined by trading. See 


I can't tell you how much I love market prophets. Like that one esteemed yourself. Seriously, if you have a crystal ball, how come you're still hanging around these parts say as opposed to say pleasure crusing on your very own cruise liner?


Yes eventually an economy will provide new aspects to the bitcoin trade. But you'd be delusional if you'd think that's the case right now.
Right now bitcoin is a pure speculation market, and it plays by pure speculation rules.

Well we're talking about an exchange here not your bitcoin client. Exchanges work by a certain set of rules. For instance one of these rules is that: If a bid and an ask have a price where they can meet, they get filled at an average price between them.
There can be any number of rules how an exchange works, and if the exchange wants to, they can add a rule for circuit breakers, or other stuff.

It's not that you couldn't charge interest. It's that usually nobody's crazy enough to take on a loan he stands in risk of paying more in interest then the entire loan was worth at the time. Likewise paying out interest would require the bank to acquire some bitcoins in order to do that, presumably by speculation... with other peoples money.

Like I say, if you're so sure of your position, I'm not advising you to buy right now, nor am I advising you to sell. That'd be silly. It'd be silly because predicting markets is a surefire way to be wrong more often then you're right.
Fortunately you don't have to be right to profit from markets. If you want to be right, join a debate club. If you want to make a profit, find a strategy that works for you.
That being said, there's a thing or two you should get aquainted with if you're in markets, so be glad, the next few paragraphs is free advice.
* Whatever happens, never buy into manias and don't panic. In fact, keep emotion out of your decision making altogether. It doesn't help. Emotion is your worst enemy.
* Learn to conquer your emotion by learning what drives it. The prime motivators are greed and fear. These two should be in a rough balance. If you're fearful all the time or greedy all the time, you can't make a profit.
* If fear or greed or emotions take over your trading, you're going to make heinous misstakes, this will cost you.
* Realize that markets are more then just one aspect. Markets have at least three major components, which is: Fundamentals, that is an analysis of the underlying dynamics of a security. Technicals, that is an analysis of the price movements and their inherent logic. Sentiments, that is a psychological analysis of what people are thinking.
* Think of fundamentals, technicals and sentiments as three pillars holding up a house. If you ignore all but one pillar, your analysis will be weak and your house, that is your strategy, will easily topple.
* Don't believe anyone who's peddling a sure prophecy where things are going to go. First of all, such people like to be right, so they usually go to great lengths to con you into thinking they where right, when they where in fact not. Second, such prophets do not make their dough with trading in the markets, they make it by attracting an audience. It's just like snakeoil salesmen.
* Be ready to jump at a market that did surprising things. Markets tend to do the unexpected and unforseeable all the time. You can't realistically make decisions about that beforehand, but you can be in a mindset (and positioning) to be prepared for it. Think of it as the first Zen of trading: preparedness.
* Be ready to exploit what others do wrong. If others are fearful, be bold. If others are bold, be fearful. If people panic, be calm. If people are calm, be worried. If people believe in a plunge, believe in a bounce. if people believe in a rise, believe in in a fall. This is the second Zen of trading: expect the unexpected.
* Exercise risk control rigorously. All of the above is worthless if you fail to control your risk.
* Plan your trades: Develop and execute a trading plan that has clear definitions for conditions under which you enter and exit. You can master all of the above, but if you fail at properly entering and exiting you will still make a loss.

I'll put this in very simple terms. Mining is an incentive driven activity. No fair price == less incentive. Less incentive == less mining. Less mining == less difficulty. Less difficulty == better price. Better price == more incentive. More incentive == more mining. More mining == more difficulty. And that's where the circle starts anew.

I don't say that things don't have to change. But I mean it was fairly obvious that this is an issue long before it was exploited.

**UPDATE (13:56 GMT)**
Peter has responded in his comments section to my letter. I'll briefly address these:


It's true that Mt.Gox is the biggest exchange. However this recent outage gave other exchanges a great opportunity to break into the market. At the end of the day, competition is good, and Mt.Gox has to compete (in quality, security and fees) to stay relevant.


Yes it is possible. I don't know the exact pricing, but I think the question implies that it'd be marked up vs. the usual dollar value. The point is that this is not very surprising (given bitcoins volatility). However this are growing pains. It's entirely possible that at some point bitcoins will stabilize considerably such that the markup gets insignificant.
That being said, I don't charge markup, because chances that it'll go up are as good as that it'll go down, and I'm happy to bear that risk.


I think Bitcoin as a system is extremely attractive especially for merchants. Only time will show if that is sufficient to break the stranglehold CC/Paypal have on the online payment market.


I'm not a lawyer but obviously those other e-currencies had no trouble operating. Liberty Dollar is in trouble but only because they have a central mint and a dollar peg.

Of course like any investment, there are risks. Singlehandedly doubling or trippling the network capacity naturally carries risks (that the price will never keep up) and it has rewards (that the price eventually will keep up).

The whole ponzi/bitcoin comparision makes me really tired, because it eventually comes down to a number of stupid arguments.
* Some happily go around telling simply because the price rose and for no other reason whatsoever that it's a ponzi scheme. I suspect the same people think all free markets are ponzi schemes, and I don't really get what **they** get out of hanging around bitcoin (this being a free market'n all)
* Then there's those who eagerly point to the fact that early adopters profited while latecomers did not so much, and herald this as the proof that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme. Unfortunately this too is flawed, because while that may be a similarity, that's also where the similarity ends. There are far more important properites of ponzi schemes which are not in any shape or form present in bitcoin.
* And then there's the sore loosers, people who simply can't get their head around the idea that early-adopters got an unexpected huge payout, after mining more or less fruitlessly for a year on their own cost and risk, and once that popularized bitcoins, the sore newcomer loosers expect a similiar return, but right now, and preferably without risking anything.
I can empathize with all of this hogwash, I'm not an early adopter, I did not profit hugely off bitcoin and all, really lads, I can feel for you, but by bringing forward stupid arguments and being sore-ass about having missed an opportunity nobody knew for sure was coming, you're not doing much for your peace of mind.

The difficulty is obviously bounded by how much hardware can be thrown at hashing, as such, it represents a hardware investment function.
This function is bounded by two factors: The amount of available hardware that can be used for it, at all, and the amount of capital that would be available to invest it in hardware.
**The current status**
* 10th/s represents about 25'000 GPUs
* At a rough estimate, 1gh goes for about 1000$. So the current 10th/s capacity represents about $10 million in hardware.
**The limiting factors**
* AMD sells about 50% of a market of about 40 million graphics cards per quarter. Probably most of them are not gamer products, but we're probably looking at around 1-5 million high end GPUs (5850, 5870, 5970, 6950, 6990) per quarter. In the grand scheme of things, hardware demand due to bitcoin hasn't offset supply by even 1%, so we're good there, hardware is supplied at a far greater rate then bitcoin consumes.
* Capital influx in hardware so far by bitcoin mining investors is in the range of 10-20 $ million. In terms of business investment this is quite a small amount of money. There are thousands of investors who're looking for a chance to plonk down some serious amount of money (I mean hundreds of millions of $) on high-risk investments, and so far, none of them has made a move. So from a capital potential point of view, we're good.
**Will big investors jump on this train?**
This depends of course on the success of bitcoin. But if we're going to make a couple basic assumptions such as:
* Bitcoins as a payment technology are better then anything else in existence
* Some fraction of the real e-commerce economy will move to bitcoin
Then it doesn't look bad. E-Commerce is by now a trillion or more market. Currently bitcoins "market cap" is at around $100 million. Assuming a liquid circulation of say $10 million, it's easy to see that if e-commerce moved 5% towards bitcoin, that the bitcoin price will have to go up to around 100$/btc in order to sustain the daily exchange of goods.
Is the difficulty going to go up? Chances look quite good for that. Some medium-sized hedge-fund could singlehandedly double or tripple the total network capacity right now.
Is the price going to go up? Chances are quite good, bitcoin is a fairly robust system and it's getting better by the day. This attractivness will win over some e-comerce and the exchange price will have to grow with it to sustain daily trade volume of goods.
If at some point most of e-commerce would move to bitcoin (or its successor) the 5 year outlook on usd/btc could be as high as 1000$-2000$ per btc.

@_date: 2011-06-19 09:03:44
Judging purely from layering these two charts besides each other, 
these fallacies are present:
* The biased sample (where an uncorrelated sample S is chosen to draw conclusions about P) 
* Composition (One chart may show a similar curve, therefore all such curves are showing the same development)
* Hasty Generalization (where a sample that is too small is chosen to draw conclusions about P)
Further evidence of fallacies are inherent in context and phrasing:
* "2000 Nasdaq Bubble" --&gt; implies a severe collapse without saying it explicitly (this is probably some other fallacy as well where the argument is presented but only indirectly and without further reasoning)
* "Similar, or very similar?"  The wording of this is constructed as to to be both the fallacy of an appeal to similarity as well as a deductive fallacy (I just saw two curves that where similar, therefore all such curves remain similar).
I get angry at people who for no good reason present completely idiotic information that has no relevance whatsoever (because the past does not predict the future).
If anyone claims to know where things are going, that is a classical case of "too good to be true" (since when you could accurately predict a collapse you could make tons of money).
If something is too good to be true, then it's exactly that.

* Decrypt on the fly, which gets rid of simple process image scanners, that'll hold for a while.
* Run the bitcoin process in a different context then possible attackers, so that a security elevation hack is necessary in order to see the process image.
* Do some active scanning for suspicious activity on the machine and warn the user if you think they might have a nasty.
* Probably a ton of other things I'm too stupid to think of, because I'm not a security programmer. But I assure you, if you go ask a top-notch security programmer, they can give you tons of tips how to secure an app on any platform.

No it actually doesn't. But that requires finer thinking. The past does not predict the future, but you can test theories about the future to some limited degree on the past.
Now that curve (you pulled for lack of a better word out of your ass) is up to interpretation, it does not, in itself show any kind of truth.
Let's see if we can derive some simple statements that would support any concrete prophecy from your pretty graph:
* Mining in the past was always more profitable then it is now [FALSE]
* Mining in the past has never been more profitable then it is now [FALSE]
* Previous drops in profitability never recovered [FALSE]
* Previous drops in profitability always recovered [FALSE]
* Profitability has been reaching ever lower levels [FALSE]
* Profitability has been reaching ever higher levels [FALSE]
So now it gets kinda tricky. You obviously can't simply condense your pretty pulled out of the arse graph to any kind of prophecy. We're in the realm of speculation now, let me show you a few statements that are true:
* Profitability oscillates in a certain range [TRUE]
* There is an upwards top tendency [TRUE]
* There is a downwards bottom tendency [TRUE]
* Top downwards tendency momentum has reversed [TRUE]
* Bottom downwards tendency is carrying on [TRUE]
Read from that what you will of course.

There's three cases to consider:
* You don't have any binding to any payment processor -&gt; Bitcoin is far easier and simpler then any of the competition (no fees, agreements, contracts, complicated API etc.)
* You do have an existing Bitcoin processor and now you want paypal/CC --&gt; new fees, dealing with complicated APIs, singing contracts and so on.
* You have an existing Paypal/CC binding and now you want bitcoin --&gt; no fees, no contracts to sign, binding against a simple and easy API which all imposes less cost on you then any of the alternatives compared (since you already did it, you know).
So for some, there's truly less cost, for others, there's no incentive to even bother about traditional processors, and for some, who went trough considerable pains, it'll be a bit of rather pleasant effort. It's really a winning proposition.

No it's fine. Please go ahead with your UASF (aka unmanaged hardfork without replay protection or pow change). Make sure to get as many miners onboard as you can too. The sooner the longest chain gets rid of you, the sooner we can move on and activate BU (cause BU will subsume the hashrate share on the longest chain of whatever fools you can trick into following a minority altcoin chain).
@_date: 2017-05-23 09:16:32


That's not how it works. At the point you're loosing say 80% of your hashrate, average block time goes from 9 minutes to 45 minutes, and average difficulty adjust period goes from 2 weeks to 10 weeks.
Sure you might have a dearth of miners mining your chain, but none of those will be falling over themselves to mine a chain with 1/5th the profit for 10 weeks...
That's why you should be worried if you attempt to make a minority hardfork without PoW adjustment, you're setting yourself up to be screwed.

You see from our perspective you block solving this problem. But regardless of whom blocks whom, it's not true that SegWit solves the problem at all.
High fees are the result of congestion. Too many transactions want to go into a block. SegWit theoretically expands capacity by a factor of 1.7x if, and only if:
1. All people stop issuing old-style transactions immediately and start issuing SegWit transactions
2. All SegWit transaction are of the minimally viable flavor (and not some LN multisignature transactions)
3. All miners immediately start mining SegWit blocks (which are the only kinds of blocks that can contain SegWit transactions)
But even if you assume 1.7x is what you get (which you won't), it's still a hard limit that's not decided by the open market. And you really do need an open market for blockspace within Bitcoin, because the open market for blockspace already exists outside of Bitcoin, and if Bitcoin doesn't compete on that larger blockspace market, it'll loose its network effect. If you lose the network effect, usability unravels and fewer and fewer places will let you use Bitcoin. If you can't use your bitcoins, they're effectively worthless, because they do not have a several thousand year history like gold, so Bitcoins would become worthless as a consequence. And something that's unusable and worthless is neither a medium of exchange, nor a store of value nor is it a unit of account. It would represent the ultimate failure of Bitcoin, and you would be responsible for its undoing.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:07:34


That is true, however that's why the activation threshold was chosen at an overwhelming majority (perhaps 95% is too conservative, but it's widely agreed that much below 75% is insanity). It ensures that the minority hashrate chain dies out quickly and painlessly.
UASF promotes client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus. This ensures that two chains result from the split for either or both of these two reasons:
1. The majority hashrate chain does not follow the minority split
2. The non forked chain introduces a soft-fork to protect against the forked chain.
Unless you can achieve overwhelming consensus, which you can't, you will end up with two chains, either of which could find itself to be the minority chain.
You accuse BU of creating a HF and splitting the chain booting miners/users/businesses etc. that do not upgrade off the network, and label that as an unacceptable risk, and your **entire** propaganda against HFs has been based on that premise.
Yet here you go and make a contentious minority hardfork (which disqualifies itself for the very reasons you argued against BU) and hope for the best that most of the hashrate will happily join you when you do.
Let's turn this around, let's suppose BU had just went the "contentious minority HF" route and forked off. Wouldn't you have warned BU that they're running all these risks that brings? Wouldn't you have ridiculed BU for creating a minority chain split on the rfacepalmcoin sub? BU still attempts to achieve consensus (if that is futile or not is another matter). But it is a lot closer to achieving consensus than SegWit or UASF. Who is showing his true colors there? Who is behaving recklessly? Who is creating a shitshow? Who is the circus clowns now?

UASF/SegWit is not backwards compatible. Any miner that does not implement SegWit can be booted off the SegWit altcoin chain by getting him to include a transaction that spends the anyone can spend transaction. That's when a chain split occurs.
The SegWit branch will orphan any block that is built on top of the split block. The non SegWit branch may accept blocks built on the SegWit, but will only do so if that branches proof of work outpaces the non SegWit branch.
Since a reorg at a significant depth is not acceptable for the majority of the miners and ecosystem, as soon as a non SegWit branch gains significant depth, miners of that branch will roll out a reorg protection in the form of adding a rule to reject a SegWit block template based block.
I wonder if you realize that just because you pretend to do a "soft fork" doesn't mean you can't end up on the legacy chain...

That's not a Sybil proof or even Sybil resistant measure of support, and the sample base is laughable.
Of the 17 companies being "for UASF" (out of 152) I've never heard of 15 of them, and 1 of those I've heard of is a miner... besides it only has 17% support (unweighted) and 3% weighted. How exactly is that "overwhelming consensus" or "what users want" exactly, even if you disregard that it's not Sybil resistant?
Here's another non Sybil resistant measure, I know a few users of Bitcoin who are technically not versed. They have no clue what SegWit or BU is, and they have no opinion either way. But when I explain to them as unbiased as I can the history of the situation, every single one of them comes down against SegWit. Funny that. I conclude therefore that users do not want SegWit. I also declare my Sybil attackable measure of user support is superior to your Sybil attackable measure of user support and reject SegWit. Ta-fucking-da.

SegWit does not make 2MB blocks. With SegWit the old 1mb limit applies, but a new 3mb limited section containing extra data is introduced. A minimally viable SegWit transaction is around 70% the bytes of a minimally viable old-style transaction in the 1mb section (however it consumes more bytes in the 3mb section).
This means that if SegWit activates and everybody immediately ceases to issue old-style transaction, you could fit 1.7x more transactions into the old 1mb section. In practice this won't happen because SegWit won't activate (95% miner threshold) and only a small minority will start issuing SegWit transactions with a slow uptake that could take years to reach 100%.
An additional complication is also that SegWit is intended to enable LN, and LN is based on multisignature transactions, which are quite a bit larger than old-style transactions simply spending coins. In combination with the fact that LN requires 4 transactions for every bidirectional channel (2 to open, 2 to settle), it means that LN effectively cuts the old 1mb block capacity to as much as 15% (so instead of ~4tps as presently, heavy LN use would result in the network being able to process around one channel every 2 seconds).

One exchange does not exist in isolation. In arbitrage you make (profitable) use of the fact that two or more exchanges have diverging prices.
You and me may not have the means to arbitrage between chinese and western exchanges, but some arbitrageurs do have those means (the sticky bit is exchanging and shuffling the fiat around).
Users who play volume games on a chinese zero fee exchange cannot guarantee that the orders the enter to do so, are not picked up by arbitrageurs. To an arbitrageur the volume games played on chinese exchanges look a lot like free liquidity (you just need to move on the liquidity fast enough to capture it).
Markets (all markets together) tend to want to be efficient. Price divergence on actionable orders is not efficient. All trading is a zero sum game, if an arbitrageur makes a buck, somebody else did not. Price divergence creates arbitrage opportunities, and opportunities attract opportunists. But that opportunity will steadily erode away, the more arbitrageurs move in. The channels to perform arbitrage get built out and well trodden and a steadily increasing amount of arbitrageurs moves in. The measure of how much of the opportunity is left is how much prices diverge percentually.
As arbitrage gets more efficient, it increasingly poses a risk to the "fake volume" because an increasing amount of it will be captured by the arbitrageurs. Hence over time, the divergence will close down and the fake volume will be damped to readjust to the risk of having been had by an arbitrageur.
So the "fake volume" in chinese exchanges is really fake, but that doesn't mean it does not represent a signal. It's just a different sort of signal.
@_date: 2011-07-01 20:09:53
It's not a truth table to begin with, and I don't think you understand the rules of the game properly. So I'll try again, really slowly.
* Difficulty is periodically adjusted.
* The adjustment takes into account found blocks over the period of time **since the last adjustment** and aims to keep that number at 1 block every 10 minutes.
* Hence difficulty is directly related to network hashing capacity. If the **capacity** remains high during a period difficulty goes up. If the **capacity** remains low during a period, difficulty goes down.
* Network capacity stands in direct and proportional relation to how many machines are mining **right now**.
* If less machines mine, then capacity goes down. If more machines mine, then capacity goes up.
* Therefore There is a direct and proportional relationship between Difficulty and existing machines. More machines mining means more difficulty. Less machines mining means less difficulty.
The advise not to mine because of rising difficulty is paradoxical for the following reason:
* If people follow the advise, then the difficulty would not go up, and the premise of the advise would have been wrong.
* If people do not follow the advise, then difficulty would go up and the premise would be true.
This leaves us with a logical conundrum in which:
* The prediction that is ignored becomes true
* The prediction that is followed becomes false
Clearly if the truthyness of a statement bases its core premise of an attribute that would be modified by the believe in the truthyness of that statement, then said statement is in one of either categories:
* The self-fullfilling prophecy
* The self-defeating prophecy (hint, that's your category right there).
Therefore you present a fallacious argument, because it poses an internal paradox.
**My conter to this advise as presented as a market dynamics and psychology table**
I realized early on that making statements like yours cannot be a valid discussion of the dynamics of price and difficulty, because such a statment would ignore it's internal inconsistency, recursion and paradox. Therefore I sought to formulate a framework in which I can make true, non-paradoxical, non-recursive statements about this relationship. These statements take the form of a non-linear systematic equation (I'll spare you the maths). But it can also be presented as an equilibrium matrix that illustrates its effects.
I base my analysis on the three premises of accepted economic theory:
* If supply outstrips demand, prices go down.
* If demand outstrips supply, prices go up.
* The activity of any actor in the game seeks to maximize his own profit.
In order to apply above rules to bitcoin, one has to figure out how players will behave on average. This is where the equilibrium comes into play. Bitcoins are not trading in the blue sky, they have certain constraints, these constraints are:
* Miners are the primary sellers (they mine to sell)
* Speculators are the primary liquidity providers (they buy to sell)
* Everybody else is the primary buyers (they buy to hold or convert)
Each group follows an equation to maximize their profit, this dicatates that:
* Miners attempt to sell high, but cease selling when price is low, since that would mean operating unprofitably, which is obviously the same as giving up.
* Speculators will buy low and sell high.
* Everybody else will buy at any price either to hold or to convert into goods&amp;services.
By their nature of these groups, there are certain market-economic rammifications what effect their actions have:
* Miners selling is a truly inflationary influence, because fresh coins out of their wallets saturate the market, and they generally do not tend to buy them back.
* Speculators selling or buying does not saturate and as such presents a neutral influence. the market, because on average they seek to hold their portfolio, so anything they sell they seek to buy back, and anything they buy they seek to sell later.
* Everybody else acts in a way that is a basically deflationary measure because coins landing in this group desaturate the market.
Additionally to attempting to maximize their profits, each group also has certain stopping criteria (their fear), beyond which it will cease to play its role:
* If price keeps low miners will stop mining (and stop selling by the same token, they are exiting the game).
* Price can do what it wants, speculators only give up once they can't trade anymore.
* Buying BTC in exchange for goods is not influenced by price
* Buying BTC to hold is only minorily influenced by price, since buy&amp;holders have a very deep time horizon in mind.
I think it should be fairly obvious how these simple rules that stem from market-economics and psychology lead to the equilibrium table I drew above.
I'm still surprised that people seem to think the bitcoin market exists into a complete pricing void and there's no psychology and underlying factors to influence it. **Every** market has fundamentals and psychology. If it was truly void, then it would quickly cease to be a market.

SegWit (which extends the 1mb limit with a 3mb witness data limit) effectively imposes a 4x penalty on any future blocksize increase. If you're asking for say 4mb blocks, you will hear arguments of the like:


Because the witness data block limit would have to increase to 12mb in size.

You forget one important aspect, which is **why** the price goes up in the first place at all (after all there's no inherent reason it should over long periods of time).
* Bitcoins themselves are designed to be deflationary (that is block sizes decrease at set block intervals).
* After 21 million coins, there will be no more new coins.
* Miners which are the main supplier of fresh bitcoins, expect to be rewarded for their trouble to mine in the first place. The difficulty of mining reflects a price expecation. A Miner does have an expectation to be able to payoff his hardware within 3 months and to mine profitably. If a miner can't do that, then his price-expectation rises, and he's not gonna sell anything below that. If the price consistently fails to meet the miners expecation, he's gonna sell his rig (to another miner) which will have equally opportunistic outlook. TL;DR --&gt; miners push price expectation up as difficulty rises.

So currently if you spend less than 5 cents on a transaction (but more than 2 cents) you might need to wait for an hour for your transaction to be included. If you spend more than 5 cents you're pretty much guaranteed inclusion in the next block. And if you spend less than 2 cents, you might wait... a while.
Like I say, I'd be interesting to see a histographic time series chart of that. But beyond that, what actually makes it into blocks would be kinda important, because I'm pretty sure there's a *lot* in it that spends less than 2 cents. It's just that the rest of the block got filled from whoever wasn't an incredible scrooge mcduck first, and that probably made the minority of what fits in the block.
I'm pretty convinced that there's plenty, **plenty** of spare capacity in blocks for people actually paying reasonable fees, and I don't shed any tear whatsoever for people who want to spend less than a reasonable amount of fees if they don't get their txes in.

Incorrect: It will result in a hypothetical on-chain capacity increase of 70% under ideal circumstances, some years down the road.


Incorrect: A straightfoward blocksize increase coordinated right and not sabotaged by the likes of you would go smooth, quick and wouldn't require SVP wallet upgrades and uxto rollover (unlike SegWit, which will take years to realize even the measly gains it promises)
 &gt; SegWit can provide individual users an almost instant 80% fee reduction, after activation
Not substantiated conclusion: I predict blocks (especially the 1mb section) will just remain full and overburdened and SegWit will change nothing about that. My non substantiation is better than your non substantiation, how about that?


Incorrect: Non upgraded wallets will have no idea what the fuck a SegWit transaction is, and they won't understand it.


Incorrect: SegWit as a SF requires 95% miner participation for good reason, to avoid a chain split. At 51% it does guarantee a chain split.

Naturally you should never forget about that. However this is also an argument that favors mining (and hence a difficulty increase which would lead to higher prices).
If you balance your operational costs and stash the rest away, then a total loss of your stash does not immediately ruin you. You can then proceed to put your hardware into storage and sell it off, to limit your hardware losses, and if you played it all well, you come out with no loss or even a little profit even if you've bought substantial amounts of hardware.
The same cannot be said about buying substantial amounts of bitcoins.

Not twice the capacity, 1.7x the hypothetical capacity, if you can get everybody to stop issuing old-style transactions instantly, which won't happen, so factually just 1x the capacity, and if you loose 50%, 0.5x the capacity, if you loose 80% 0.2x the capacity and if you loose 95% 0.05x the capacity. Then there's also the matter of not just those miners that refuse SegWit, but those that don't upgrade, which will further cut it down in capacity unless you're prepared to orphan their blocks, but if you orphan their blocks you don't just lose some % of their hashrate, you loose 100% of their hashrate. So good luck.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:59:39
The discussion was about the actual block limits, of which post SegWit there are two, the old 1mb section, and the new SegWit 3mb section, making together for a total maximum blocksize of 4mb. However with SegWit, all transactions (SegWit or otherwise) need to add an entry to the unchanged 1mb section, hence no blocksize increase. Please educate yourself of that for which you advocate.

A fee market is an oxymoron. A market is where goods are traded at an agreed price between seller and purchaser. For instance a wheat market is a market where wheat is traded. Fees are not the good, they're the payment for whatever is traded. What is traded is blockspace. The "alternative" to a "fee market" is a blockspace market.
A blockspace market does presently not exist within Bitcoin. It does not exist because Bitcoins blockspace market is in a state of what you call ["market failure"]( because no matter the amount of demand of the good (blockspace) the supply (and therefore the fair price for a good) is not influenced by this (that's why fees just go up). Please note that market failures are often caused by price-fixing, cartels, monopolies (state sanctioned or otherwise) and they are widely considered to be harmful to society and economy. Sometimes market failures can persist successfully in case that a provider of a good has the power to exclude others from that market (for instance trough a state sanctioned monopoly or patents).
However Bitcoin cannot exclude other cryptocurrencies from providing blockspace. Therefore a market failure in Bitcoin is not sustainable, demand for blockspace will simply vanish from Bitcoin and migrate to other cryptocurrencies. This will lead to the marginalization of Bitcoin and consequently, a value and price collapse because the only thing that gives Bitcoin long-term value is utility driven demand, and the current price levels reflect the speculation on that demand, if the possibility of the demand evaporates, then so do the current valuations.

There will always be signals that market participants react to that are in hindsight irrational (including how much credence to assign to prices of other markets).
But the overall effect of bad markets will also diminish. Back when there was Gox and little else, the effects of Gox where large. But after the goxxing, people in western accessible markets got taught a valuable lesson. This year its Chinese markets which are teaching the Chinese about markets, after which a lot of Chinese markets will clean up their acts or go out of business to be replaced by better ones. Next year, who knows, it might be middle-eastern markets who repeat the same for their local audiences.
The more diversified and mature the overall landscape becomes, the smaller the impact of the wild frontier of markets for audiences who haven't learned the lessons of the goxxing yet. It's all part of the process to a stable ecosystem. And while periods of irrationality and wild gyrations are regrettable, they're also necessary and unavoidable.

I thought providing the basic relationship **is** letting people make their own decisions.
I'm not saying this has to go this or that way, but it is a sort of relationship. We've been in two profitability lows before and everytime it happens people moan.
The swinging around that you observe, it's an oscilation that was observed 3x already.
What you're looking at is a set of relationships that exert forces on each other, which have different resonant frequencies and which have each a momentum of their own. A natural result of such systems is oscillations.
What you're observing for instance right now is that price momentum has reversed (but is slowing) while difficulty momentum is still carrying on upwards (but is decreasing). This is not surprising as I've already mentioned that price is far quicker and nimble in momentum then difficulty.

The problem really is that you lot argued against taking such risks even if you had 75% of the hashrate guaranteed on your side, because it's a risk, any risk at all, and used that as argument to stall things for over 6 years.
Yet, here you go and conceive the least organized and worst possible HF (contentious, minority, unmanaged, no replay protection, no reorg protection, no pow adjustment, no nothing) which nearly guarantees that it's gonna be a disaster in every way. But you see nothing wrong with that...

That's not how SegWit works. SegWit as a soft-fork keeps the old block-structure and block-size limit of 1mb intact so that it can claim to be a "Soft-Fork".
SegWit moves some data of a transaction from the old 1mb block to an extended section 3mb in size. Every transaction (SegWit or not) needs to be included in the old 1mb section (which you refused to raise).
The theoretical 1.7x capacity increase happens when 100% of people would be issuing minimally viable SegWit transactions, because those transactions occupy 1.7x less bytes in the 1mb section.
In practice not everybody is going to instantly use SegWit transactions, not every SegWit transaction will be of the minimally viable size (especially not those multisignature LN ones) and not every miner will produce blocks containing SegWit transactions (remember it's supposed to be a soft-fork).
It's sad how ill-informed you lot are about the thing you "promote".

Many people having a say isn't a bad thing exactly (it can be).
It's a well known problem that any large company is a maze of bureaucracy, responsibility gardens, glass ceiling stacks, etc.
Big companies know this too, it's why they gobble smaller companies who have managed to get shit done rather than doing it themselves. It's not that the bigger company didn't have the resources to do it, it's that they don't have the sociopolitical internal structure that'd allow them to, they're no longer able to innovate.
On any account, when several big companies realize that they have to collaborate on a problem the whole insane circus goes up a notch. Now you not only have all the insane internal debilitating sociopolitics that prevent one company from achieving anything, you now combine the debilitating condition of **all** companies involved.
Usually futile attempts to deal with that situation is then working groups, committees, etc. Although they're not bad per se, they don't really make things go smooth, they just stop things from grinding to a complete halt.
When many companies/people involved does become a big problem is when you combine it with the inadequacies of big companies to tackle problems. We've seen how many people involved in a community with dissenting opinions can be a debilitating condition in itself with Bitcoin. Now imagine this on steroids with management hierarchies, glass ceilings, incompetent workforces, committees, working groups, lawyers, stock-holders, regulatory compliance officers, unions, labour laws, sarbannes oxley, etc.
However bad and practical joke'ish you think the whole Bitcoin scaling debate has become. Whatever Banks are doing right now, bitcoins socioeconomic problems pale in comparison to that.

It does not. It shuffles parts of a transaction into a section of a block that's not checked by clients against the 1mb limit. A minimally viable SegWit transaction is 1.7x smaller than a minimally viable old-style transaction, that's why you can get 1.7x more transactions into the 1mb section.
However it buys that by adding 3mb of extra space to store the shuffled around parts of the transaction, and it does that because it's expected that SegWit transactions will be quite a bit larger than old-style transactions.
In addition in order to realize the 1.7x gain (using 4x as much actual blockspace) you need to rollover all UXTOs and every User has to issue SegWit transactions, this will take considerable time.


Malleability fixes are not breaking LN or Sidechains. They help. However there are many less intrusive ways to fix malleability. Or did you mean skyrocketing fees and slow and unreliable transactions are necessary for 2nd layer scaling? In that case you'll just get expensive, slow and unreliable second layer scaling.


Actually it's BSCore that could have avoided this by deploying SegWit + 2mb when they promised they'd do that. They could have avoided having to promise to do that (and not keeping that promise) in the first place if they hadn't disenfranchised a large part of the community by refusing blocksize increases in the 2-3 years prior.  They could still have avoided splitting the community if they had categorically taken a stance against rampant censorship and personal attacks... But of course BSCore started the personal attacks in the first place.


Miners aren't Signaling for SegWit because they don't agree with reckless radical experiments with the fundamental economics of Bitcoin. And neither do a whole lot of businesses and users. SegWit was only palatable to miners if it took their concerns into account and also included a blocksize increase. The reason that didn't happen is to be found with BSCore. There's nobody else you can blame for that.


That's rich coming from a cheerleeder for the side that created the split in the first place via astroturfing, smear-campaigns, individual attacks, dealing in no faith, disenfranchising of constituencies and evidently running a sophisticated narrative control army that congregates in back-channels to coordinate their campaigns...
If you're looking for blame for why we got to where we got to, you've got to stop blaming those that don't agree with you, and start looking at why the conflict exists and who utterly failed to keep the community together and build the necessary bridges.

Which met widespread resistance and outcry, it's there where things went off the rails completely because everybody expected a solution to the blocksize problem, not a cementing of the blocksize problem in place. You can't just ignore a large constituency for years and not expect any resistance. I was frankly offended by it back then, and I still am, but what really pushed me over the edge was when the dissent was censored. It's why a year later BSCore promised SegWit + 2mb at the HK roundtable, and then promptly reneged on it. In December 2015 Bitcoin was worth $5b. Ethereum, which is eating Bitcoin alive is now worth $23b. Just 41 days ago Ethereum was $5b. Ethereum processes more transactions than Bitcoin by now, and every odd day their exchange traded volume surpasses Bitcoins. Ethereum has no blocksize limit. They have a floating gas limit which is voted on by miners. Ethereum is beating Bitcoin on its home turf, without even trying to do that. The the saddest part of the story is that Ethereum was started by a former Blockstream employee who couldn't bring the innovations he had in mind to Bitcoin because he was blocked by BSCore (and primarily the higherups) from doing so. Meanwhile Bitcoin has lost over 40% of its market share (surprise surprise). How long will it take you folks to take a hint when the hint hits you in the face with a sledgehammer and caves your skull in?

Reserve currency is **exactly** what bitcoin is. It's not arbitrary at all. It gives every other coin fungability. Without fungability, those coins would face a long or infinite time to get any traction at all. Bitcoin is accepted by **every** altcoin as the reserve currency, they're not "taking away from bitcoin". By their existence they strengthen bitcoin. You can't become more popular than the basis upon which you derive your existence of. You might dispute that this is so, and I can prove that it is so. I can prove it if you look at the altcoin charts. They don't move in relation to fiat, they all move in relation to bitcoin. Bitcoin does good, altcoins do good **over** bitcoin. Bitcoin does bad, altcoins do bad **over** bitcoin.

The core "scaling roadmap" was just released last week, and it does not fix the most important thing that needs fixing. Without a floating blocksize you have no blockspace market, what you have is a [market failure]( (aka "fee market" which would be an oxymoron). Market failures are generally a bad thing and guarantee an inefficient allocation of resources because supply is inelastic (does not move regardless of demand), though market failures can persist if there are outside forces that prop them up (such as government monopolies or patents). However Bitcoin cannot prevent other cryptos from providing blockspace, so a market failure is a Bitcoin failure, because the demand for blockspace just moves to where more supply is offered, and so Bitcoin fails to compete. Failure to compete and provide a superior product in terms of usability, price, speed of service and reliability will be Bitcoins downfall in a market as hotly contested as cryptos. Bitcoin did have a first-mover advantage for a few years, but it choose to idle that time away having pointless political debates, and now it's fucked if you don't do something, and fast. And that something is starting to compete. And competing requires a floating blocksize. Anything else is inconsequential at this point.

Are you going to open half a dozen payment  channels with random people and stick several hundred dollars worth of bitcoin into each so that you can send a few bucks to some random person/service? How many people will do that? Nearly nobody? Well then you have a problem, because unless every LN participant does that, payments won't be possible between random participants.
As a consequence, central "hubs" would be hugely favorable, where a user opens a single channel with, and then uses that hub to interact with the LN "network". Of course creating such a hub requires vast reserves of capital (imagine servicing hundreds of thousands of people, you'll need millions of dollars of investment to stick into your channels).
The central "hubs" everybody connects to are then free to deny payment if they don't like it (like if you'd like to send funds to wikileaks), and they're also free to deny you service altogether (and keep a black-list) so you can't sign on with the LN central hubs. If this sounds like banking, that's because it is.

Handing somebody a loan in btc is extremely risky for both creditor and debtor. It is likely the debtor will use most of the loan early on. It is also possible the value of bitcoin goes up. Which means the debtor would owe the creditor a multiple in real world wealth to pay the loan back.
It is risky for the creditor because: there is a high risk the debtor will default on the loan.
It is risky for the debtor because: he might end up owing a multiple in real world wealth to the creditor.
The inherent risk ensures that creditors are more careful whom they give credit. And debtors are more careful when they take up loans. All in all, a good thing.

His understanding of bitcoin improved, but he's still not getting it.
He's listing all the desirable attributes that he understands about bitcoin
* [correct] Bitcoins are divisible, like gold
* [correct] Bitcoins are scarce (21million), like gold
* [correct] Bitcoins cost money to produce, like gold
* [correct] You can send bitcoins trough the internet, unlike gold
However, there is also misstatements like this:


Peter, if you have an ounce of gold at home in your cupboard. Does it cost you any money to store it? No, just like bitcoin, that doesn't cost any money. Do you need to secure your private keys, protect them from being stolen or lost? Yes, just like gold, you need to protect your bitcoins. Does it cost any money to store bitcoin? Yes, just like gold, if you want to protect your private keys from physical attack, you need to deposit them in a hardened location, such as a bank vault.
After this, Peter dives straight into his main missconception and in a nutshell, goes like this:


He elaborates on this point as:


And then he goes to explain how this is different from bitcoin as:


Brilliant Peter, thank you for making my point. Ohwait, now I'm confused, that was meant to be an argument against bitcoin?
Ok, sorry Peter, I skipped over your perceived "salient" point, gold is real, and bitcoins are digital, gold has real uses, yes I heard that. But you also freely admit later that:


Yes peter, the key word here is **had**. Pretty much all industrial uses of gold have disappeared or are on the decline because the stuff is so darn expensive that every industry looks to new technologies to replace or reduce it, where they're still using it. And the only "industry" that still uses it exclusively is jewelry. And while that's fine, jewelry isn't a usecase you'll want to stress too much. Jewelry is also largely bought for its property of being made out of gold. If times are good, people might buy jewelry out of gold because it's nice, and because it retains its value, unlike say, diamonds. But when times are hard, jewelry will be bought exclusively for the purpose of having the gold that's in it. So arguing jewelry is a "use" is circular reasoning, at least when you need it most.
So, you where saying gold won, because it had use, and today it's a speculative vehicle. That's fine.
But you know what Peter, that's just like bitcoin. You're arguing that gold had a lot of desirable characteristics, and thus it won the currency competition.
Bitcoin is winning the currency competition, because it has a lot of desirable characteristics, some of which you've listed, but importantly, some of which you didn't, such as:
* Bitcoin transactions do not require counterparty risk. They are cryptographically secured and verified by a global network.
* Bitcoin is a protocol as much as other things, and as a protocol it enables widespread interoperability, facilitates fungability, reduces the cost of transactions and makes transactions faster.
* Bitcoin can be used for other purposes (which you disputed) such as proving that a document was created earlier than a certain point. It can also revolutionize the practise of verifying deeds (such as used when buying houses). In the future it could revolutionize how securities are traded (colored coins and what have you).
Peter, you are also veering into a whole tangent how bitcoin isn't replicating all the attributes of gold (which you argue made it valuable in the first place). That's a silly argument, of course bitcoin isn't doing that, it's digital, it couldn't do that, even if it tried. But this point is moot, because bitcoin has attributes that gold does not have, which makes it uniquely more valuable on the internet. And I don't know if you noticed this Peter, the internet's become a pretty big deal these days. And certainly if you didn't realize, maybe contemplate about it by the fact that your message, brought to us, over youtube...
Peter, you're also comparing bitcoin with fiat currency, which you and me both loathe. But here's the thing, even though your bitcoin "receipt" (the private key) is kind of like a fiat currency bill, there is a substantial difference.
Imagine if you will, that for some reason (feel free to insert magic here) that fiat currency bills where limited. Imagine that they couldn't be created out of thin air at will no matter who wants to do it. Wouldn't that take a lot of the sting out of it being "fiat", in fact, wouldn't that make them not fiat in the first place? Well here's the kicker Peter, bitcoin is that. It can't be created at will, production is limited and declines over time, guaranteed, no matter who wills it to be otherwise.
Now let me take a stab at your beloved gold. You see, bitcoin-bugs, they don't particularly like gold because of a thing you call "paper-gold". Now I believe you've argued this before, if you buy gold, take posession, i.e. get it delivered to you, physically. That's fine, that's very good advice. But see, the thing is, the value of your physical gold is still determined by the paper-gold. Sure, physical gold will be worth more than paper-gold if paper-gold gets into its dreaded "is this really backed by gold" collapse. But because the amount of paper-gold at this point far exceeds the physical gold, and the volume of exchange of it far exceeds any possible physical exchange, paper-gold will drag physical gold down none the less. And to top it off, you're now in a liquidity trap. You see, once you destroy confidence in paper-gold, the means to exchange it quickly rapidly declines. Banks would certainly dump it off their portfolios as a means of settlement. What do you think happens to the gold price when large holders of physical gold start dumping their reserves because it's practical utility for it is lost for them?
Peter, you also argue that bitcoin might be worth nothing for the following reasons:


Yes that's true. And you know what, it happens all the time. But see, bitcoin isn't fixed. If some (we call them altcoin) comes up with a very desirable feature, bitcoin can adopt this feature. Yes I hear you argue Peter, but what if that altcoin takes the lead?
Hm, yes Peter, how many facebook or twitter competitors did you see succeed of late? Ah, yes, none. Why? It's called the network effect. Even if you make an inferior product, if the worth of that product relies in a large part on the network (of people) who use that product, then a competitor will have a hard time attracting users. Now, I've got no doubt that if facebook continues to suck, that eventually a better facebook will take its place. But, that's really the fault of facebook, and I don't think that bitcoin, which is actively developed, would simply never improve and only adopt worse features than before.


Aaaaaand we're back to paper-gold. Sure, somebody could do that. There's just two problems with it:
* You now require counterparty risk, i.e. trust, that the one signing the gold bit-receipts is telling the truth. That sucks, really much.
* And even if the one signing your gold bit-receipts is telling the truth, the government can just knock on the door and take the gold away, and now your gold-receipts are worthless.
So that's not good enough.
TL;DR Peter is still full of shit, and talks out of his arse about bitcoin, even though he's learning a tiny bit more about bitcoin everytime he talks about it.

Let's say you penalize HFT by raising the fee percentage by frequency with decay. Say 100% fee is at 60 trades per hour. 0.6&amp; fee is at 1 trade per hour. Make it mildly exponential, say 1.5 or so. Decay is 80% trades per hour.
So if you do 3-4 trades per hour, you're still almost at 0.6. But if you do 30 you're up to 50% fee, and it gets worse from there. And you'll need to sit out about 12 hours to get back to 0.6.

IBTimes is quoting the "survey" from coinjournal which posted it to "its readers". As to how representative those "readers" are one can only speculate, they have not provided the necessary sample information to make a judgement.
Secondly the coinjournals "options" are walls of text that likely nobody would have read. But even if they would have read them, the descriptions are biased and do not discuss the drawbacks of SegWit while praising SegWit, and do not point out the advantages of alternatives but spend generous amounts of text describing their drawbacks.
Thirdly, no allowance in the survey has been made to measure the comprehension of readers with the matter. At the very least a proper survey would include control questions that ask the survey takers about their beliefs in specific areas particular to the alternatives, to measure if the respondents actually support a proposal from conviction and understanding, or if their selection of alternatives is contradicting their beliefs. This is all survey 101...

Did I just read that right? ZH makes the argument that endorsement by a fiat HF makes bitcoin invalid because that'd just end up being hyping a price that the HF will later unwind into fiat?
So that's completely bunk. Here's why:
* Fiat and Bitcoin are not mutually exclusive
* Just because some speculate with bitcoin doesn't mean it's invalid as a currency. Do you know how many speculate with fiat?
* Bitcoin isn't "just a currency". It's a protocol, which expresses an accounting system, that runs on specific rules to encourage transaction processing and scarcity, which means it's all of these things simultaneously: 1) A payment system 2) A commodity 3) A currency 4) An account 5) An accounting system 6) A messaging system 7) A database 8) A peer2peer network 9) A double spending validator.
ZH doesn't seem to fundamentally understand bitcoin.

Yes, but to take it they have to ask him to give it up (they'll probably just coerce him with a much harsher sentence if he doesn't give it up). And to know if he's given it all up, they'll need to figure out from whatever transaction trail they can get their hands on. That's where it gets kinda tricky. They can figure out pretty accuratey how many coins he got, and where they went after that from the blockchain.
The easiest scenario is when he's got his stash in a cold wallet and it just sits there. In that case they can pin down exactly if he's given it all up.
But if he wasn't completely stupid, he stuck his coins into a particular kind of mixer, that sends them around continously that makes it look like he spent them and they're now back in circulation, so he can claim in court believably that most of the coins are gone, and the court can't prove that it isn't so.

Just because you are using the scientific method, does not mean that your conclusion are any less fuzzy. Political science concerns itself with social behavior of animals, hairless apes in this instance. The conclusions it draws can only extrapolate to that one animal, and only insofar as the animal population has a common behavior, and only insofar that the very same ape can observe and understand it. The very same conclusions might be entirely ass-backwards refutable given another group of apes, or another group of apes looking at apes. Insofar the scientific method doesn't mean diddley squat in a universal context, for a discussion that contains almost no apes at all. The discussion of civilizations in the universe might contain nothing like mammals, or any animal familiar to the apes. In fact it is highly likely you will understand the behavior squid, conchs, slugs and bugs better than you'll ever understand any non terrestial life. As such, any statement of the social sciences has become irrefutable and subjective (to the apes). If you would ever find evidence contradicting its findings, you would retreat to argue it was only meant to apply to apes. Irrefutable arguments aren't the scientific method, at all.
The conclusions of physics can be refuted. Regardless of what you are, be that a bug, squid, fish, reptile, ape, machine, or any number of fantastically outlandish extraterrestial forms of life.
The watt derives fromt he newton. The newton derives from the metre and kilogram. The metre is defined by the speed of light. The kilogram is currently definition less and uses a reference object. However serious efforts are underway to define a kilogram in terms of for instance the planck constant.
Of course we don't know if the speed of light and the planck constant are universal. After all we only have a limited local area to measure it in. However it is extremely unlikely that the speed of light and the planck constant would turn out to be more fuzzy than social sicences troughout the universe.

Mt.Gox is currently earning about $100k-200k per day. They have been doing that for about 60 days in a row now.

That's one way of looking at it. On the other hand there is an enormous risk attached because:
* It's an unregulated exchange, if it all goes belly up, there is nobody protecting investors.
* The company in question engages in an extremely risky business
* The share price is bound to collapse to half by 2017 when payout halves, so if it does deliver 100% in 2 years many will cut and run before their shares eat up 50% of that profit.
The risk is literally off the charts.
On any account, the prevailing price of a lot of the companies listed on these exchanges tracks an expectation of about 100% in 12 months. And many fall short of that, and the price falls down further in response.
So holding these shares is just about as risky as it gets. And before anybody comes with the smart idea to only hold them for dividends and hope the price stays flat.
* 1% fee
* 6% spread

Right, so credit and loans with bitcoins. At the moment bitcoins have a technical inflation of about 12%. It'll drop to 2% by 2020. But they're also going trough a wild boom adoption curve.
They are truly deflationary in the long run where inflation drops to virtually zero (2036 and beyond).
So for now, and for the future they will appreciate (let's just assume that).
If you lend somebody bitcoins, and want interest, then the debtor of that amount has to work ever harder to meet a fixed interest rate. Neither creditor nor debitor are interested in such a scenario. The creditor would never see a return on his loan because the risk of a default by the debitor is high. And the debitor would never see a return on his work because he gets ever behind being able to pay the interest.
So the deflationary nature does not prevent fractional reserve banking, loans and what have you. But it has to be very certain of the chance of success for each party to enter the agreement or the risk is both loose.

Inflation is low because a decelerating money velocity, caving consumer demand, contracting economy and deleveraging of debt act deflationary. But none of these is in direct control of the Fed. And they're part of a complex feedback system. So, if you let this go out of whack too hard, you can literally run out of means, to keep it running and the music playing. That's certainly true of runaway deflation, it is somewhat true of runaway inflation in the sense that, the cure is worse than the disease.

CFD is the normalized form of going long or short with leverage.
For instance, say take a stock (AAPL) and you go a CFD long. If the price of AAPL rises, the money to pay you has to come from somewhere. The brokers only way to insure himself against a long AAPL bet is to, himself, buy some AAPL shares. The same in reverse applies for shorting. The only way a broker can insure himself against you going CFD short on APPL is when he himself sells some AAPL stock.
Of course the broker isn't obligated to actually insure himself, and he can bet against you. After all, most people are crappy traders, so betting against them by not betting with them on or against the stock would probably be a profitable strategy.
However a CFD broker will carefully control his bets (with or against) his customers, because ultimately somebody will end up paying, and they're not interested to be the paying party.
Regardless of what the broker does, CFDs also pay dividends. If you long you get dividends. If you short you have to pay them.

Well, buying low and selling high **is** the general idea. But how interpret that idea is up to you. Most people interpret it as, picking lows and highs and trying to ride them. I don't do that because of two reasons. First of all it's very time intensive and nerve wracking, and there's a bunch of other things I've got to do, than watching tickers. And the second reason is that, being daytrader is a hard skill. I've figured out that I suck at it and that I'll lose money if I do it. Most people don't realize that it's really hard. So knowing yourself, what you're good at, what you suck at, what you enjoy doing, and so on, is an essential part of how you should trade. It's as important as controlling risk.

You're alluding to the fabled zero liquidity. See, that one isn't happening. There might be two reasons for zero liquidity. One is that nobody will sell their coins, the other will be that nobody is going to buy them.
The case that nobody sells their coins doesn't happen for as long as somebody has coins. You can't drive the price to zero if nobody is selling you any. You'll have to bid higher, until you convince somebody to sell their coins.
And the case that nobody buys doesn't happen for as long as people have fiat to spend. The lower the price, the more enticed people get to buy, and their purchasing power rises.
The "price" is where this equilibrium of supply and demand meet. There are quite a few things that are for all intends and purpose quite worthless (like zipgap shares, ixcoins, feathercoins, hollywood-stocks, etc.) yet those continue to trade, and have more than zero liquidity simply because you can trade them.

No, this is how the wallets that they found are seized. If there where funds in a "cold" wallet, the only person who knows how to access them is DPR. They might know that there is a cold wallet around, from infering it from the blockchain and the flow of coins, but not necessairily. Because you could write a script to perpetually send coins around in a mock of actual transaction, to obscure which of the coins are back in circulation (and therefore assumed not to be in DPRs control) and which aren't.

A deflationary currency doesn't necessairly mean that it will always deflate. If the economy grows, then it is deflationary. If the economy shrinks, it's inflationary. Deflation puts a damper on the economy, since it delays spending. Inflation puts an incentive on the economy, since it encourages spending. Therefore, a truly deflationary currency is self balancing.
The naked fiat currency that we run, is not self balancing. It encourages investment overheat while the economy stagnates. It can lead to completely paradoxical situations like stagflation. It is also effectively destroying the economy because the feedback to correct is outweight by an investment overhead, which necessitates further lowering (or keeping low) of the interest rates artificially (rather than have the market determine interest rates) and further money printing and debt taking.
The argument for the inflationary society is extremely weak, and the experiment is extremely young, and it is about to fail, again (as it has in smaller settings so often before), only this time it will fail globally, which will be a truly terrifying experience.

Those are all the necessary incredients to create the more exotic contracts like swaps of various kinds. The recorded history of OTC derivatives only starts at about in the early 90ties. But it is of little doubt that varieties of such contracts have been used for hundreds of years.
Regardless, those aren't strictly speaking "innovations". They're just new flavors of contracts. Innovations are:
* Coins
* Bank Notes
* Credit Cards
Why? Well coins is fairly obvious isn't it. But wait a second, bank notes are just repackaged bonds/debt, why is that an innovation? Well because it made money more practical, nobody wants to lug around copious amount of metall, so it solved an issue that coins had, and consequently relegated coins to a minor role in exchange. They invented on a need. So why credit cards, aren't credit cards just repackaged credit? Well yes, but nobody wanted to lug around wads of cash you have to replenish at every given opportunity, and it could get stolen. So credit cards relegated wads of cash to a minor role. They invented on a need.
There has not been any such invention from the financial services industry in the last 40 years. Why sure they invented all kinds of contractual gizmo derivatives, but they didn't solve any need that the population needing to deal with exchanging carries of value has.

Well, these ICOs are technically securities. And securities are already very well regulated. Securities law is primarily enforced by exchanges (which in turn have to abide by the law or suffer the consequences). Sure the SEC can go after individuals who break that law, and they sometimes do, but that's like clubbing groundhogs. So enforcing the law on exchanges solves most of the SECs problems.
The problem of ICOs is that they do not have "exchanges" other than the Ethereum blockchain. That will eventually put Ethereum in direct conflict with the SEC which will demand that illegal securities aren't to be traded on Ethereum. And that will be a **huge** problem for Ethereum, because Ethereum does not implement the "exchange", they just implement the platform to write the scripts that can be used to implement securities. Which is technically cool, but the SEC won't take "can't do, sorry" for an answer. And the only thing Ethereum can do to comply would be to disable scripting altogether... and that'd be a big clusterfuck.
The SEC can go and declare Ethereum illegal until they come into compliance. And all the corporate backers of Ethereum would then have to bail. When push comes to shove, Ethereum the "corporate project" will comply with the SEC. And it will cripple Ethereum. Of course there'll be a fork at that point, and there'll be an Ethereum neo-classic or something that still has scripting. But it won't have any corporate backing and will be illegal and therefore not be supported by any sort of reputable exchange/business. And the crippled ethereum will suck.

Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal. Some are of more interest than others. Even so, an important feature of a cryptocurrency is what you can do with it. How many people have it, how many businesses accept it, how many exchanges are there, how well funded is the network of full nodes, and such.
This is known as the network effect, where the usefulness of something increases, the more people use it, and more people use it, because it becomes more useful. Cellphones, The Internet, E-Mail, Facebook and Twitter rode that effect all the way to the current day. So, of course did myspace, which failed, and now facebook looks to be faltering, why? Because both facebook and myspace, as companies, failed to deliver what their customers sought in the first place. For instance, wheras facebook got more useful to a point, it is now getting less useful everytime they update the website because they stuff more idiotic gunk into it that nobody wants.
But it's important to realize that bitcoin isn't a company, where some thickheaded management (zuckerberg?) can make some unilateral decision and screw it all over. Bitcoin is open source, it's a community. It has the ability to adapt to changing circumstances and correct mistakes. If you will, it's more like Linux than it is like Windows. Whereas windows was managed by Steve Ballmer into the ground with a string of bad management decisions that eroded the technical quality of the product as well as ruined the company (stackranking), Linux is managed by linus torvalds and the lieutenants, which act as gatekeepers to patches coming in from the community. So the reality is that while Microsoft won the PC-wars, they lost the smartphone wars. And while Apple where the first to decide conclusive victory, eventually Android took over the majority of market share. Android is Linux. Community beats thickskull CEO. QED.
But the analogy to the latest social sites is a flawed one. Because bitcoin isn't the new twitter. Bitcoin is a protocol, among other things. Like Ethernet, TCP/IP and HTTP are protocols. For the most part, the protocols that first establish themselves tend to stick around for a very long time indeed.

A study of fiat currencies spanning the last 400 years, the average age of a fiat currency is 27 years. Of 775 studied currencies, 20% died because of hyperinflation. 21% destroyed by war, 12% destroyed by independence, 24% monetarily reformed and only 23% are still in circulation.
The most long lived currency of the world (the pound sterling, since 1694) has lost 99.5% of its value in its lifetime.
No fiat currency (past or present) has deflated or stayed flat. Every single one inflated.
The USD inflation is around a few percent nominally per year. However that means that:
* Since 2006 if you hold USD: you lost 13% of your wealth
* Since 2000: 25%
* Since 1980: 65%
If you intend to hold USD for the next 50 years, you will lose 50% of your wealth as the CPI reaches a projected 450. If you had parents bequeath you an inheritance denominated in USD in 1980 it will have lost 82% of its value by the time you get ready to give your kids an inheritance.
However these projections assume that the economy isn't going to go trough another 2-3 crises in the next 50 years and that the government makes every right move it can to avoid tipping the system over into a death spiral. There's virtually zero room for mistake in this anymore. The interest rate can't be raised to get some maneuvering room because then the government would have to pay more interest on its own debt, which it can't afford. The only thing the government can do is print money. It can't stop printing money because it depends on the steady influx of cheap money to keep going. So the only lever left at this time for the US government is print money or print more money.
This is typically how bad inflation periods start, when all other means to influence the economy have been exhausted.

Well, somebody on a forum claims something without any way to verify and backup his story. Could be anybody cranky with an axe to grind against BFL for whatever reason. Who knows.
Now, it is true that BFL has failed to deliver any ASICs so far. There was one post on a forum where somebody received one, but that's not so much confirmation. So I'd say the judges are still out on that case.
So what I did with BFL is I ordered their smallest unit (the 4.5gh one) for $140. It's to see if they can deliver, if the thing conforms to spec, and if it gets delivered in a timeframe that doesn't render it a piece of junk by the time it gets here.
If that works out, splendid, I might buy more in the future. If not, well, the $140 don't bother me so much.

I'd propose we change the terminology, right here, right now. Bitcoin isn't "the standard" of or for cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin is the world reserve currency of cryptocurrencies. That's an important distinction to make, and it encapsulates in one simple term exactly what the relation in the ecosystem between bitcoin and all other altcoins is.
These are the essential observations I hold to be self-evident about bitcoin and altcoins:
* Bitcoin provides fungability to all cryptocurrencies (you can always go from and to bitcoin from any altcoin in order to go from and to any fiat)
* If Bitcoin does well, then so do altcoins (can easily be observed in their */btc exchange rates and volatilities)
* If Bitcoin does bad, then so do altcoins (see above)
* If Bitcoin where to die for whatever reason, it would strike a severe, perhaps unrecoverable blow to all cryptocurrencies.
* Bitcoin does not depend on any altcoin (although they certainly help Bitcoin by their acceptance of Bitcoin as their reserve currency). But all altcoins depend on bitcoin for their continued immediate, and perhaps final, survival.

I don't know where the price will be. But I know that it will not be zero.
Bitcoin has a community of likeminded that for whatever reason buy coins no matter the price. They spend what they can spare, and they stay liquid and buying, for years, for decades.
As price rises, their effect on the market wanes. But as price drops, their power rises, and the selling power of the people dumping the coins wanes. This gives rise to an equilibrium that is above $0. Where those of strong conviction snatch up most coins with a minimum of capital, and those of fickle minds loose most of their coins.
Perhaps we are behind those days, of deep drops, and rises like pheonix from the ashes. Perhaps we are not, and we shall have to prove it time and time again. Who can say?

Are you really that naive? First of all, of course a bank lends out as much as they can, preferably on as high interest as they can. A great way to do that is credit cards, bug I digress.
This is the system, not the banks balance sheet. If somebody goes and deposits at a different bank, the bank that gives the loan doesn't have to take that reserve rate into their own books.
You seem to somehow think that banks aren't out to screw everybody over every which way they can. Well tough news buddy, they are, and you've been suckered into it.

You won't find an example of either of it because of the way that ripple works. There are severe limitations.
* Ripples transaction verification isn't proof of work based. This significantly lowers barriers to attack (or fracture) the verification network. Instead of proof of work, ripple expects verification server operators to maintin a list of "trusted verification servers", what's that even mean? You mean like DNS, yeah because that works like a charm everytime a registrar gets hacked that everybody trusted.
* Ripples individual unit of account is IOUs. To put it simply, if you want to get in/out of the network for whatever reason (say paying your rent?) then you need to rely that all the IOUs that accrue along the path of "trusted" nodes that connect your network aquaintances with the origin of the funds aren't going to default. Yes, you heard that right, you need to trust everybody in the chain, which could be long, convoluted and involve people you would **never** trust if you knew that the funds that prevent your landlord from throwing you onto the street are going trough lil jimmy from around the corner who hates your guts and spends all his money buying weed whily busily filling out funny-money IOUs claiming he's got a zillion bitcoins.
The allegation that Bitcoin wouldn't be suitable for aforementioned activities (disregarding sheer cluelessness about bitcoin) stems from the difficulty to get them converted to and from fiat (and from the volatility if you want to be assinine). But unlike Ripple, at least in the case of bitcoin you **select** whom you trust and nobody else.

That's a distinctly different position than "oh the fed can just destroy the money they printed". That's the position of that the offer something to sell and when it sells it, destroy the money. Like for instance, the swiss could try to sell the euro back in return for swiss francs and then destroy those.
It's a cute idea, but it's got a problem. It only works if you find buyers. A lot of the time, this won't be a problem, but there are always conditions when you would need to do this most, that you might find it hard to do because nobody is buying it. Usually, the reason why it's impossible to find anybody to buy it, is the very reason you're desperately trying to sell in the first place. So you can't force the market to buy. You can hope that it'll buy, and it might buy, but there's a chance it won't, just when you need it most. Just keep that in mind.


I'm not disputing the effect of raising the interest rate. I'm disputing that in an emergency situation anybody will have a clue how high it'll have to go to effectively stop the tsunami coming over the barriers. You'll notice it having worked, about a month after the event, when the catastrophe wasn't as bad as it would have been bound to be (even though post-hoc you can always argue about that since you can't repeat the experiment). So don't forget, this has delay, and the delay it has, maybe not make it possible to accurately judge an action at the time to be on either of optimal.
Now, there's another problem with it. If the Fed raises the interest rate, this has an effect on depositors, banks, homeowners, credit card institutions, business loans and so forth and that hits trough to any derivative that touches them. One of the effects is that loans would need to be renegotiated across the board. And on the receiving end of that renegotiation you'll have businesses, homeowners and the general population with their various forms of debt.
So you might have stopped a irregular and high inflation, but, you've actually just rolled the cost over into everybodies debt. And that point it doesn't really matter if people defaulted on their mortgage because the banks renegotiated the mortgage due to rampant inflation and their salary isn't covering the payments anymore, or if the banks renegotiated the mortgage because of rampant interest rates that push payments beyond your paycheck.
People will default on their loans, in masses. And that'd just be the start.


Look, it doesn't matter if you overreact to a deflationary situation that induces hyperinflation, or if the hyperinflation manages to get there by itself. In the end, you have a profound loss of confidence, and the deflation will run itself out simply because at some point it meets the liquidity it needs to stop. A recent study found that the policies enacted by FDR actually prolonged the depression by more than 5 years.


There's no citation needed. You just need to apply some basic common sense. If something happens anywhere in the world, within milliseconds everybody else on the world will know. Knowing, doesn't spread the crisis. What spreads it is that everybody in the world is financially hooked up to everybody else, within milliseconds. The web of investment, speculation, financial instruments, pension funds, banks and what you is so intricately linked, there's really no part that will be unaffected or where the effect will arrive months later. This is unique. Up until around 1990 that wasn't the case. And even then, things wheren't woven so tightly together as they are today.
So yeah, the greeks or romans or ukrainians or germans didn't screw up quite as spectacularly as we will, because their crisis didn't drag the world immediately into it, it took years, decades and sometimes centuries for the full effects to percolate trough the world. But this leisurely pace at which you'll see a crisis unfold and affect the world, that's not how the world works anymore.
Now the recent issues of Zimbabwe. Western finance is discriminating against much of the developing countries, heavily. It's throwing up, let's call them "firewalls" to insulate them from whatever these governments do. It's grossly unfair to the people in those countries of course, but there's reasons why western finance does that, one of them being that you don't want to be intricately linked and entwined with an entity like Zimbabwe that you suspect might do something funny any moment.
But this kind of selection doesn't work retroactively. If you are gonna lie in bed with somebody, you might wish to reconsider when they start throwing up, but that won't prevent the vomit splattering all over you and your bed.


And yet, shit happens and nuclear power plants do blow up or almost blow up and have catastrophic failures beyond anybodies wild imagination. You can't appeal to expertise (of politicians and lawyers, of all people) to prevent meltdown if you're thinking about how you're gonna prepare for a worst case scenario. That's a bit like going about saying, yeah these folks told me if I exercise and eat healthy I won't get sick, so I'm not gonna buy health insurance. And then you're in a car accident and you owe the hospital half a million squid.

Well, unless you generate the dictionary, you can't sort it, so you can't do a quick lookup.
So sure, you could have an ASICminer hash for you very fast. But let's say by the end of the year the network reaches 1th/s, that's 10^12 h/s, so you're short 10^62. The whole bitcoin network would need another 10^45 billion years to exhaust it.

Suppose you have $20 to spend, and you buy bitcoins for $10 today and $10 tomorrow.
Suppose todays price is $250/btc and tomorrows price is $2500/btc: So you buy 0.04btc today, and 0.004btc tomorrow, so a total of $20/0.044btc = $454/btc. So you beat tomorrows market by 550%. Had you bought everything today you would have made 1000% profit. Had you bought everything tomorrow you would have made 0% profit.
suppose todays price is $250/btc and tomorrows price is $25/btc: So you buy 0.04btc today and 0.4btc tomorrow, so a total of $20/0.44btc = $45/btc. So you made a loss of 225%. Had you bought everything today, you would have made a 1000% loss, and had you bought everything tomorrow you would have made a loss of 0%.
In case of rises you make a handy profit, and in case of crash you have limited your loss to much less of what everybody else lost.
More importantly, the guy who lost 1000% is no longer liquid. But you are still liquid, the longer the price stays depressed,  the more you can make up of your loss and wait for better days. The guy who lost 1000% has to wait a long, long time to ever see a profit again.

If you really really look at what you just pasted, you'd see that this supports my entire discussion.
The majority of gold consumption goes to jewelry, which is made of gold, because gold is valuable, and it's valuable because people like to see it in jewelry. You can't use jewelry as a "use-case". What you're left with is industrial consumption of a smaller fraction of production, that can't account for the price levels it's in. If you accounted for actual use, which is a fraction of yearly production, and also accounted for the fact that reserves exceed use out to thousands of years at an absolute lower bound, then the actual gold price would be in the range of about $50 - $100/oz. Gold has a fantastic overproduction, and it's marginal mining cost is at about $1000/oz, so there is some demand that makes it feasible to continue mining, and that demand isn't use.
I'm not arguing that demand doesn't exist. I'm arguing that demand is indistinguishable from the demand for bitcoin.

* Get a money transmitter license
* Setup a MSB/AML (anti money laundering) conformance process
Note on the transmitter license. This is probably going to require a large deposit. However, you can take out an insurance bond (ask your lawyer how to get one). At historically low interest rates, this can be quite affordable even for large sums.

Sure, I'm not debating that scrypt requires more hardware. But the issue doesn't go away merely because you make the problem more difficult.
The problem stems from capital concentration or alternatively the ability to attract many miners into your pool or both. Bitcoin is just further along on that curve than other coins that use an alternative hashing algorithm, because it's the most fungible coin. I.e. it's more interesting to do it for bitcoin than for litecoin.
Using a different hashing algorithm isn't a way to "win the coin game", it's merely a way to end up with the same problem a few years later than bitcoin.

Well, let's assume the price stays flat:
* 1% fee
* ~6% spread
Assuming a price of 2.7btc/share, that's 0.189btc/share cost. Extremely optimistic dividend is 0.056btc/share. After you're done you're **-0.133btc/share**.
And that's assuming that you'll get paid the full dividend. The markets don't actually state what they're doing (I think it's some 8 hours before dividend to get full). But most, let's say more grownup markets measure it in time you held since last dividend. So buying just before dividend gets you flat, nothing, or very nearly.

Of course it's a problem of the exchange. But it's in your interest to make things better, not make them worse.


I aggree. But again, you're making your business trough your partners. It's in your interest to help those partners because if they do their job well, you can do your job well, and everybody wins. DOSing an exchange because it's shoddily implemented and then just going "meh, I don't care" isn't sustainable neither for you, nor for the market.


So basically the 2 hours of 30 minute lag screwed you big time.

I think that both are a manipulation of a market. I believe that a free floating market is the more efficient means to figure out pricing. And I think that attempts to manipulate the market always end in tears, because they mostly do historically. The intention might be benign, but it usually makes matters worse.

Sure, ripple is an "exchange". But, far as exchanges go, it doesn't do what I need it to do.
Suppose I am a freelance programmer (it so happens that I am). And suppose I was in switzerland (it so happens I am). Now suppose I have a client from the US (it so happens that I do). Now I'd like to get paid say $20'000 for about a month of work trough ripple. Splendid. Now I'd like ripple to give me that so I can pay my taxes and rent...

I don't think that'll work well. Verifying arbitrary computation isn't cheap or easy. The elegance of the hashing solution is that it's an asymetric function. Hard to compute, easy to verify. This makes the network robust.
You could in theory assemble a catalogue of arbitrary computation with asymetric properties. But to fully appreciate what you're suggesting you need to understand that the "hard" part of the asymetry needs to be pretty much ironclad. SHA256 fits that pretty well because it's extensively researched and tested. If you just write your own array of hash functions you would need to replicate hundreds of thousands of manyears that went into verifying that SHA256 is doing what it's advertised as just to get to a comparable comfort level that you're now in terms of security.
But even assuming you can find an array of asymetric problems that are extensively researched and prooven, that doesn't mean somebody won't make a chip for it that's vastly more efficient. You are reducing the problem domain from general computation to a specific set of tasks. Engineering an architecture to do them well with a combination of modularity and hardwiring will be possible.

Sure but you can't measure it like that because the price of goods that are sold in bitcoin is tied to the fiat exchange rate, and the exchange rate is largely speculative and not much driven by a real economy yet.

Governments won't embrace ripple for a few very simple reasons:
* In ripple everybody prints their own funny money, and governments don't like that
* A private company holds 30% of the reserve, and they can't have that.
The same reason why bitcoiners don't trust ripple, is why governments don't trust ripple. And even if one government would trust ripple, that just raises the bar for the next government which now has to trust ripple AND that other government. Like say, would you really see the US embracing ripple after China has done so?

He's a crank, and I mean that. He might have his faculties when he writes a scientific paper, I've never read on of his. But he definitely doesn't have all his marbles when he's misusing his publishing opportunities in a fashion of publishing his personal crank blog. He also definitely needs some much needed psychiatric help in dealing with criticism, and this has been documented by many people who have criticized him. Here you have an "intellectual" who regularly doesn't read what his detractors write, but often embarks on a personal crusade to character assassinate his critics, without even understanding why they disagree with him about something.
This guy, is incapable of civilized debate. He's incapable of publicly making a coherent point. He's incapable of reading other peoples works. He's incapable of thoroughly researching things about which he writes. He does not belong into the column of any self respecting news publication. He's free vomit his crank blog all over the internet, but please, have him do it from his own website if you, as a newspaper, have any dignity left.
Everybody is entitled to his idiotic opinions and voice them. But nobody is entitled to be taken seriously, to not have his idiocy being point to him, or be respected. Respect, has to be earned, and the way to earn is is to engage in intelligent debate, even with ones critics. Since he fails completely at all these basic skills of public discourse, it's of little surprise that he's being ridiculed and disrespected.

The exploits and backdoors are there because they've been left there, intentionally.
Some are know, most, are unknown except to the NSA.
Problem is, making devices is a huge and capital intensive process. It's centralized and homogeneous. A few select factories and foundries are the gateway to the electronic components found in every device that is produced.
If you find a backdoor or exploit that's been left there in any chip, from any of hundreds of brands, it means that these chips where going trough one of dozen or so production lines that makes them.
It means, the entire production process of every device produced is corrupted. It means that, if you go trough the channel to get your device produced, it will be corrupted. It means that, it impossible for anybody, produce a device that is not backdoored.
This is the world we live in, and right now, there's nothing we can do about it. I can only hope that, in the future our device production will be heterogeneous despite the huge market forces that want to concentrate it to ever fewer companies. I can only hope that, the devices in the future will be open source, and that you can verify the output with a microscope to make sure your designs where produced as designed with no secret addons.

Nope, you see, MtGox isn't a real exchange. An exchange means people can get bitcoin in and out, and they can get money in and out.
* You can get bitcoin into Gox no problem
* You can maybe get bitcoin out, that seems to lag a bit at times.
* Putting money in takes considerable time
* Getting money out is practically impossible
This means that, basically Gox isn't an exchange so much as a bitcoin dispensery. People go there to buy bitcoin, not to sell them. Some people sell there, but they're special lucky because they live in japan or something. An exchange where the only activity that happens is that the few liquid sellers have standing sell orders, and everybody who wants to buy needs to buy into those orders, isn't much of an exchange at all.

The value cannot be negative, or zero. No seller would "sell" bitcoins for $0.
The question is one of how low it can go, and in this context it's good to examine mtgox historical data.
At no point in time since 2010 where more than 2.5% of the monetary base of bitcoin exchanged per day. At the current time this means that 275kbtc need to serve the capital in search to buy a coin.
The current capital in search of a coin is $6m/day as of last week. Down from highs of more than $20m 6 to 8 weeks ago. For much of 2012 the volume was in the range of around $500k to $1m, it is quite unlikely current day volume would fall back to these levels.
This means that purely from a demand perspective the very hard bottom will be around $4/btc to $21/btc. Lower values, while theoretically possible, would be extremely hard to achieve since there simply aren't enough coins willing to take a walk to smash trough daily demand and drive price lower.
You will notice that $4 is, subjectively, quite a long way away from $0.

What I just said is based on the idea of [economic equilibrium]( It is necessary to ensure [efficient allocation]( of resources (purchasing power and means of production). It can only work when both demand [and supply are elastic]( Unfortunately Bitcoins blocksize limit acts as a [production quota]( which leads to artificially inflated fees. This situation is otherwise known as a [market failure]( because the supply of blockspace is inelastic, and it means Bitcoin is [not operating efficiently]( However Bitcoin is [not the only provider of blockspace]( and therefore unsatisfied demand for blockspace simply [moves elsewhere](
Please consult any introductory 101 economic textbook or ask your economics teacher/professor about the subject if you'd like to verify what I just said. It's a widely accepted working principle of markets.

Ahm, ok. Disclaimer, I don't own AMC, and when they where on the market at IPO price, I didn't buy any. So here's why:
* The IPO was somewhat bungled in that shares where sold "as you go" rather than at a fixed price, and this wasn't announced before. Eventually the exchange forced AMC to sell the remaining IPO at 0.0005.
* The previously listed businesses of AMC aren't anything to go by (just a few basic webdesign gigs, half of which aren't online anymore).
* AMC has a "contract" with VMC, both AMC and VMC are owned by the same individual.
* This "joint announcement" is really just the same dude putting out a press release
* Apparently AMC has a "team" but there's nobody listed for that, and nobody ever heard of it.
* Crunching a bunch of numbers on the 0.0005 IPO shows that at most the owner of AMC got out something around $100'000, which isn't even remotely enough to get into the business of having a chip foundry produce your design.
* Dividend payments so far have been sporadic. But the last two dividends came trough within 7 days from each other. So let's be very optimistic and say there'll be 52 dividends/year from now on. The amount was 0.00000101btc/share. The price is as of now 0.0025btc/share. That means at the current level you need roughly 50 years to recover your investment.
* Even if you assume that dividends are going to rise, they would need to rise by a factor of about 16x to draw even with asicminer. That would mean that AMC would have to pay 640btc/week to all shares, i.e. 0.000016btc/share. To achieve this level of dividend at current hashrates, AMC would have to be in posession of about 4th/s of hashing power. It will rise towards 10th/s at the end of the year.
* The currently published plans of AMC don't include anything much beyond a 1-2th/s, and when/if that is going to arrive is anybodies guess.
So, enjoy the ride while it lasts, I'm not touching AMC, I hope, sincerely, that I'm wrong and AMC share owners are going to have a very good time. But don't tell me you haven't been warned.

There's two reasons why changing POW would be stupid.
* It wouldn't achieve the intended effect (if the intent is to do away with capital intensive mining equipment). There would just be an adjustment phase for the mining industry, new asics chips would be designed and the mining equipment goldrush would start anew. Those who claim that you cannot make an asics for other algorithms are fooling themselves. An asics is nothing else than an algorithm expressed as hardwired circuitry. As long as you can write software to perform the algorithm, you can make execution of the algorithm vastly more efficient by designing a custom chip for it.
* Miners are the backbone of the network. Bitcoin wouldn't die if you change POW, but it's essentially a restart. Confidence in BTC would wane (and correspondingly the price) and It puts bitcoin in the same category of altcoins like ixcoin, litecoin, bitbar etc.

It doesn't matter if you're right, or if I'm right, and far as I know, I didn't even make a point to be right about.

Peter is at it again, this time I'm not going to address his usual falacies, but I'm going to pick on some novel grievances:
* You conclude from your perspective that bitcoin is just like internet stocks in the dotcom boom or the housing bubble, because just like then, you got bombarded with critisism that looks very much the same. You're essentially saying "I'm right because people disagree with me." Yeah that's not how it works. You're trying to derive validation from opposition, but, how many people disagree (or agree) with you isn't at all relevant at all.
* You wish you had bought bitcoin years ago... yeah don't we all Peter. We have a term for it, it's called butthurt. Don't let it ruin your day, almost everybody's butthurt when they first hear about bitcoin.
* You're doubting the security of bitcoin itself, stating that you have no idea, but that it's probably easier to fake than gold. Well, not really. This would be a very longwinded technical answer in detail, but you're basically talking out of your arse right there.
* You're constantly hammering on the volatility, well, sure, volatility isn't terribly nice for adoption, but you can't have any adoption without volatility, that's some fantasy pink pony dream. So for better or worse, bitcoin's (and any other altcoin) is gonna have to make it with that volatility.

While you're basically right that it's not safe, giving advise converse is equally irresponsible.
There's more ways to lose money, than losing it on a decline. The best way to lose money is selling it into a decline and buying back higher.
You can't emphasize the risk of holding, while downplaying the risk of selling. They're both risks, and far as volatility goes, they're both about equal.
While it may be more harrowing to sit on a losing position, you have not experienced true agony until you've bought back higher.
The determining factor to hold or sell should be your conviction and comfort zone.
* If you're not convinced that bitcoin is gonna make it, why did you buy in the first place?
* If you're convinced that bitcoin is gonna make it, why should you sell?
* If you have less in than you're comfortable of losing, why haven't you bought?
* If you've got more in than you're comfortable losing, why do you gamble?

Well lucky then that those involved with the stewardship of Bitcoin had more than half a decade to prepare, test, deploy and prepare their HF code isn't it? /s
This problem doesn't exist since yesterday, it was, in fact, being discussed as far back as the patch was introduced. It was also extremely clear from day one more than half a decade ago that a substantial constituency does not agree that a hardcoded block size limit that does not get revised for over half a decade will be appropriate. And yet those involved with the stewardship of Bitcoin intentionally disenfranchised that sizable constituency and thereby engineered division and conflict where none should have existed. Bitcoin did operate successfully for the vast majority of its lifespan without an effective blocksize limit (because blocks where smaller than the limit). And the dangers of fundamentally changing the successful economics of bitcoin with a reckless experiment have been pointed out for years. Yet those involved with the stewardship of Bitcoin have ignored all that.
The direct result of all this is that Bitcoin is now being marginalized by upstarts less than 1/3rd its age. That's the measure of failure we're talking about, and you still want to argue that that it needs time and testing and argument and that SegWit is best, really? Even though those "in charge" had more than half a decade of time and ample warning to pull the thumbs outta their arses and do the the right thing, unite the community and bring Bitcoin forward.
You seriously expect that the argument "but muh it needs more time" isn't seen as anything more than a silly stalling tactic, really? Because you had more than half a decade and ample warning to prepare for just this contigency, yet you ignored all warning, wasted all time, and didn't even get your thumb outta your ass to do anything whatsoever about it, you didn't even attempt to get the thumb outta your arse.
If we'd give you those 6 months to get the thumb outta your arse, you know what you'd do? Nothing. Zilch. Nada. Nix. Exactly diddly fucking squat. That's why that argument is null and invalid.
You've been pathologically incapable of doing anything for more than half a decade while telling and promising everybody that you did something. You've been pathologically incapable of listening to warnings, reasoned arguments or even the warning signs staring you in the face of other cryptos overtaking Bitcoin and the community being deeply deeply split. And yet, you still didn't get the thumb outta your arse for more than half a decade. You do really wonder why you get no trust whatsoever? Really?

Comparing strategies you need to consider risk chances.
* Does strategy A have a smaller than 50% chance to loose out to strategy B?
* How are the chances distributed across the outcome, how often will a 10th percentile outcome of strategy A loose out to strategy B?
If both overall outcome and distribution of outcome of strategy A is less favorable more than 50% of the time, A is not the better strategy.
You can squabble about the fineties of distribution (is 1% underperformance in the 10th percentile an acceptable risk when the 50th percentile happens less than 50%? Well, if you're investing $10'000 and you have a 1:100 chance of underperforming a **lot**, do you feel lucky punk?)

Essentially, no, you can't remove the money. For instance the US has created most its money to buy back bonds on the market and giving those dollars to, whoever had those bonds. You can't make those disappear again, they're no longer in control of the Fed.
In case of Switzerland, the currency was used to buy Euros. Which means that most of it now belongs to somebody else, not in control of the swiss national bank.
Once you put the new money out there, it diffuses trough the system, and you can't get it back.
What the central bank **can** do would be to raise interest rates, at least, in theory. But, there's serious questions if they're standing in front of an avalanche that any raising of the interest rate will accomplish much, and what that level would be. Now, regardless of if it is effective or not, they can't raise above a level that would make it impossible to maintain debts (such as their own internal or external debt, or banks debts or credit debts etc.).
They certainly can't do anything else than printing mad money when they stand in front of a runaway deflation caused by a contracting economy.


That's quite right. They didn't fuckup at quite the scale as we're gearing up to. But in terms of comparing any history to today, yeah, we can do that, no problem. Reality doesn't change because we think we're more fancy today. The fact of the matter is, the world economy didn't do fantastic since 2008. The world population only rose by 4%. Labour participation rates are down to historic levels since WW2, everywhere. Consumer demand in many sectors is caving. Stock markets go to all-time highs. Governments around the world enforce strict financial limitations and so forth and the money that exists in the world has more than trippled since 2008.

Yeah, that would work. The problem is that money equals power. And if you have more money than others, that gives you more power to influence the "democratic" process that would change taxation.
Now the problem is this:
* 1% of the us population has ~20% of the income and owns ~50% of the wealth.
* 0.1% of the us population has ~10% of the income and owns ~30% of the wealth
* 0.01% of the us population has ~7% of the income and owns ~20% of the wealth
Wealth is power, and if you equate power with influence over politics, it means that the 1% have the necessary power to block anything the other 99% want to do. The 0.1% have enough power to change any decision requiring a 2/3rds majority. And the 0.01% have enough power to seriously tip the scales.
In short, it's pretty much hopless.

You're mistaking fact for fearmaking. Yours, mine and everybodies BTC will become instantly worthless if somebody alone can control the blockchain every single block.
Don't believe me? Think about that. The block reward is cross verified by the network. If somebody attempts to give themselves a block reward not matching the rule, the block is rejected. But if you stamp out every single block yourself, you can grant yourself whatever block reward you want, nobody can challenge your view.
Or here's another one, you can include whatever transaction you want. Including crediting yourself the bitcoins of everybody else, because again, such a block would be verified by the network, but you are the network, so there is nobody to challenge you.

The Kardashev scale doesn't define "success", it is a classification. And it is a good classification because its indicator (energy use) is objectively measurable. Unless you want to dispute the foundations of physics, you can't argue how much energy a watt is.
Political science is in the discipline of social science. This branch of human knowledge concerns themselves with the rather fuzzy subject of human social behavior and as such, rarely arrives at any kind of objectively irrefutable statement. Physics is in the discipline of natural sciences. Statements that physics make can be tested and refuted no matter what kind of of person (or extraterrestial) you are.

Any free floating market always has swings, nothing new.
Bitcoin is an attempt at fixing national monetary policy, credit institutions, credit cards, online payment and online commerce and get it ready for the 21st century. Its quite ambitious. And to do all that, it needs to grow. Growth is painful and haphazard. But without growth it cannot happen. Bitcoin brings some extremely compelling arguments to the table as to why it is the right choice to solve all these issues. Arguments that neither governments nor credit institutions can counter in any shape or form with any offering of their own.
Growth means that valuation has to go up, since there is only a limited supply of coins. It would be illusionary to imagine that bitcoin would be able to capture any significant amount of the worlds trade if it stayed at low valuations. Sometimes the valuation might be before growth, and sometimes it may be behind growth. But one thing is very certain, there is lots of potential for growth.
You might not like that valuation is haphazard, panicky and fraught with violent swings. But you cannot deny that this is the way things will have to be for years to come as that baby grows up and fills its market.

I'm not defending BFL. However if you did your homework **before** buying at BFL you would have noticed that it's a high likelyhood you might get screwed. Consequentially I bought the smallest thing they offered then at $140. Risk migitation.
However even though BFL has a good likelyhood of being a scam, there can be situations where that might be worth it to some.
Imagine you're one of the early adopters and you are sitting on a stash of say 20'000 coins. When prices hit $200 that would've been over $4 mio hypothetically. At the time BFL was "selling" a 1.5th miner for $30'000. That would have been  150 coins, or about 0.75% of your wealth. You probably knew the price was going to collapse soon again, and you also knew that if BFL delivered the 1.5th thing, within the next 1-2 years, it would make it worth your while. So though the cost seems enormous, to somebody with a serious stash of coins, it still looks quite attractive. Risking less than 1% of your wealth with a say 10% chance of winning with a potential win netting you in the order of 1000% is still a good bet.

To the media and the nice lady from the video.
Bitcoins are created by mining. Mining is the activity of signing off a block of transactions every 10 minutes.
Hashes are random looking strings created from other strings. They are important to bitcoin and are the same thing that drives your e-banking (sha256). Hashes are easy to compute for strings, but it is hard to compute the string for a hash.
Every block that somebody "mines" must:
* Contain the hash of the previous block
* A list of valid transactions
* A random number
In order to be valid a block has to:
* Have a hash lower than the target (known by everybody from the average of the last 2016 blocks to aim for 1 block every 10 minutes)
* All transactions in it have to be valid
* The credited reward to the miner has to conform to the halving of the reward every 210'000 blocks.
* Contain a previous valid blocks hash.
Once somebody found such a block (which is a bit like playing the lottery) he submits it to the network. The network validates the block and accepts it as the next block in the chain by majority.

Well it's anybodies guess how that will play out. However I think that attempting to make it illegal are both futile and self-defeating for the following reasons:
* If you qualify the criteria of illegality as using the moniker "bitcoin" then you can just call it by another name.
* If you qualify the criteria of illegality as using encryption and P2P networks you'll have a much bigger problem than grumbling from bitcoin users.
* If you qualify the criteria as cryptocurrency, you will have to qualify what a cryptocurrency is.
* If you define one definition, bitcoin makes a protocol change that doesn't fit the definition, it's out of it again.
* If you define cryptocurrency as any protocol that allows people to keep a shared database with information in it, you face a significant bigger problem than grumbling from bitcoin users.
* Making something illegal often has unintended side effects (like making it more popular, streisand effect, ongoing court cases with the EFI etc.)
* Laws are only effective if they can be enforced. How effective are copyright laws for P2P networks? If the risk of getting cought are effectively zero (because of mass) then the law is bad.
No matter what kind of definition you come up with it can be circumvented or would wreck massive harm on the digital economy as a whole. You will likely end up making bitcoin more interesting and more widely known while hurting yourself.

It always struk me that comparing bitcoin to a currency or security was wrong when talking about manias and busts. It's neither really, and all of it, rolled into one.
So Bitcoin has real utility. It's awesome, it's how the future of exchanging value will be. And the people who buy into it, long term, me included, we all believe this. We also have no doubt about the technical soundness of the system and the economic fact of deflation as adoption rises.
So it's not really comparable to a security (where you judge a companys future) or a currency (where you judge a countries future). It's juding the future of value exchange. And that future looks quite promising and will continue to do so, no matter what the current exchange price.
And that is the reason why there is no shortage of demand. Because as the price goes down, there is a hard core of demand that will buy them no matter what, a core that knows what the future looks like when it hit them over the head with a bitcoin.

No, you just need some sort of arrangement for somebody to give you (or sell for you) a stash of bitcoins that the would-be short trader doesn't have.
But again, shorting something, perhaps even with leverage, is a trade that carries unlimited risk. In practise, it's not so dire, you'd just deposit a security (your trading capital) and the party who's sold the bitcoins for you buys them back automatically when that reaches zero.

While I don't disagree with the basic statement that if stuff goes up fast, it corrects fast, and I'm not in any way surprised by this, I think that, this too can be a dangerous way to look at it.
Bitcoin isn't a stock, currency or commodity. It may share some characteristics of those. For instance it can be a means of exchange, which it shares with a currency. It can also be used for things and it has a limited production rate, which it shares with commoditities. It can also stand in for a share of the future of bitcoin, which it shares with stocks. It is also a protocol and an accounting system, which none of the other are.
So when speculation holds sway over prices, as it frequently does, your statement is pretty correct.
However speculation isn't the only thing driving supply and demand. There's also the factor that the non speculative use of bitcoin makes it scarcer. Because those bitcoins in circulation, are not available to be sold on an exchange. The more people use it, the fewer coins will be supplied. In the same vein, increased usage creates non speculative demand, because in order to use bitcoins for something, you have to get bitcoins in the first place. So the more people use it, the more demand there is.
So when you see a spike in price, you don't essentially know what the reason for that is. It is likely it's speculative at this point. But, it can likewise be caused by a surge in economic activity occuring.
So when the price spike is speculative, the usual rule of corrections, resistance and so forth apply. You can make money doing your swing trading if you feel so inclined, and feel safely in control of what's happening.
That is until your strategy hits that spike (or low) that isn't speculative. When that happens, prices may do irrational things, like not correcting after drastic gains, or not recovering after sharp losses.
The way that volatility is going, you'll only run into a couple of those "irrational" movements before you've destroyed most of your capital.

That's of no use really.

I don't think there's anything wrong with HFT as a business. I'd like to point out though that when the exchanges overload and you get to 30-minute lag before your orders get entered into the system (or cancelable) there's two major drawbacks.
* You crash the market
* Your bot entered trades that can turn out disasterous.
So the obvious answer to this problem is: Better performing markets. And that's not easy to do (see how MtGox is struggling), and cost a bunch of money.
So maybe rather than just sitting in the corner and and DOSing exchanges with your HFT bot. How about you work together with the exchanges to improve the situation? Have you talked to MtGox? To any other exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:35:53
It means that MtGox capacity is below the ability to accept HFT behavior and they get blown out of the water, and the HFT guy doesn't care, he's gonna burn down MtGox, and bitcoin, and whatever else in a policy of "burned earth and hell after me".
If you're an exchange that's letting people abuse you to the detriment of everybody else, you're doing it wrong, obviously. That's why I say, exchanges should just fee the shit out of the HFT assholes.

The fundamental value of bitcoin is its utility. Gold does not have any such utility anymore.
Money, is an incredible success story. And almost all of the tens of thousands of years of history of money is built on the idea of irreversible exchanges between two parties without counterparty risk.
But then somewhere along the lines we stopped doing that, and switched to a credit driven vehicle with counterparty risk. This is a fairly recent story, it's only about 40 years old, with a very spotty track record of being a good idea, and it hasn't improved since. Credit itself has a longer history, a history often mirred in major societal upheaval, to the point that some religions made its straightforward application impossible (Islam for instance). And that isn't even starting to tell the story of the massive economic harm that is wrecked by the central control trough counterparty risk that the credit vehicle driven economy is addicted to.
Bitcoin is the rejection of the idea that something that has worked for thousands of years, cannot work in the digital age. Plain and simple.

NMC is a special coin with a specific goal, to make exchanging domain names seamless with NMC. It does not matter that NMC is not useful as a generic payment medium at merchants, it's purpose is aimed at solving a problem of the DNS system.
For LTC it does matter that it isn't as widespread as BTC. But this is quickly changing. LTC blocks are mined every 2.5 minutes (rather than every 10 minutes for BTC) which means it'll mature/deflate faster, and it also means that transactions are 4x faster.

Gold doesn't have any major industrial application anymore. It's main application is jewelry, and while nice, isn't something people couldn't live without.
Golds utility faces two major problems in todays world:
* How to facilitate counterparty risk free real world exchange
* How to facilitate counterparty risk free digital exchange
Real world exchange of gold is impractical for the following reasons:
* If somebody hands you an amount of gold, it is difficult to verify how much actual gold you got. It could be gold coated, it could be a gold alloy, etc.
* The smallest feasible gold coin (defined by the size of fingers of humans) would still weight about 11g and be worth about $450. You cannot pay your starbucks coffee with it, because it would not be possible to give out change.
* If abandoning coins and going for flakes, there are a variety of practical problems like mechanical durability and precise measurement that make using gold flakes as a medium of exchange difficult.
In digital exchange, gold has no property endowing it with any practicality for that purpose that does not involve counterparty risk.

But China's got a burgoning black market, a lot of the countryside engages in barter regularly, their organized crime is frist class and you can always oil the gears of the "inofficial official" business with generous bribes.
If China bans bitcoin, then I'll predict a growth market in chinese btc. use in the following sectors:
* gambling
* prostitution
* drugs
* bribery of officials
* barter economics
Of course, the chinese would rather that their own do all these things in the yuan, at least there it's halfways controllable. They might find that banning bitcoin was the most stupid thing they could do, because it's a lot harder to sniff things out of the blockchain if you can't rely on a multitude of regulated exchanges to give you personal information leads on transactions.

You see, that's where I think you're wrong, and ripple is wrong, and mastercoin is wrong. The brilliance of bitcoin is exactly that is has no need for complicated, barely graspable contortions of questionable effectiveness to provide the bulletproof accounting.
In essence, bitcoin is the proof that worse is better. There's a long history of trying to create digital currency, just like you are trying to, by coming up with some kind of fancy model, bycantean in its complexity, graspable by second to none, and it never worked. Not. One. Single. Time.
You're claiming that it is possible to have such a model, and to prove its correctness. Yet, you don't have such a model, it's just an unproven assumption you're throwing into the room. I say it's impossible, which is just another unproven assumption. They way to prove that you're right, and I'm wrong, isn't to throw your assumptions around unproven. The way to prove is to do it, there's no other way, no amount of arguing on reddit or hiring PR people will do that.
Now I personally think, you're wasting your time, just as mastercoin is. You're trying to build on sand, and it's not gonna work. But as you're aware, the absence of a solution can rarely be proven, unless you're goedel, and even then, it might be tricky.
The burden of proof, unfortunately, is on you, and you alone. And even then, you might arrive at a thesis that's impossible to disprove, so it's effectively still worthless.

That's why. Mtgox has weathered each storm there was, while other exchanges came, got pwned and went. It's not just about price, it's also a certain trust that now that Mtgox has been trough the thick of it they know what they're doing, simply because, their website is up, and they've not gone out of business.

You're using the (alleged) fact that they expanded office space as proof that they're not short on liquidity.
This is faulty reasoning, and I can illustrate why.
Suppose Gox decides at some point that they're covering expenses with customer funds. I.e. they're gonna "borrow" from the customers. Let's say they rationalize this, by thinking that they'll be able to repay that debt before the customer would notice due to an expanding business, and anyway, it's unlikely anybody would notice because only a small fraction of those funds are actually withdrawn by clients at any one time. And hell, it's one good deal of credit right? I mean, zero interest rate, who can resist?
So what'd that look like? Well, they'd suddenly be flooding in cash, with which they can do things like expanding office space, tapping into larger markets (like the US with a partner) and getting some kind of banking license. It's all good right, I mean, they're gonna expand business, and the customers aren't gonna notice. Also they're now kind of a fractional reserve bank and anyways the bitcoin price is fairly stable, it's not gonna explode upwards right?
Alright, but then things go wrong. They've used those customer funds, converted them to fiat so they can do something with it (like expanding office space) and then the price shoots up. Awshit, now they're owing like 10x the amount they borrowed in the first place, not good, not good. But the business is still growing right? Awno, that deal with the US partner fell apart, and now you're being sued, and it costs like shitloads of money to cover legal expenses. But hey, you still have the funds right? Well, nope, some of your fiat accounts got frozen, so you can't even migitate your loss by buying back bitcoins. And to top it off, the market you thought was "yours" is now slowly being canibalized by competitors, so instead of growing your business, yours is actually contracting. Well, it could be worse right, there could be some kind of bank run couldn't there be. Wee'elll there has been kind of a bank run by pretty much everybody.
Now what, you're sitting on a pile of debt that you have no hope of ever repaying. If you admit to that fact, you're gonna get gutted in a heartbeat as everybody runs for the bank. So what's left to do? Just keep going, tell everybody things are alright and hope for the best. You still got cash, hell what does it matter if you hold 50% or 30% of customers funds at this point right?
P.S. Bonus points for who can guess why Gox seems to be sabotaging the bitcoin prices in the past when it shot up ("DDosed", service outages etc, **always** at the worst possible time). Anybody? Ah yes, you in the front row. Yes that's right, if they would owe a pile of debt to customers, and they're liquid in cash, then the last thing they need is for the bitcoin price to go up before they've not unwound some more of that debt.

Name some. The ones I know about are:
* Medicinal use: This is mostly a fringe use requiring very low amounts of gold (for things like gold nanoparticles and the like)
* Photography: The application of silver bromide to produce photograph reproductions has been on the wane since the invention of digital photography, and even then, using gold to shift the hue wasn't a major application.
* Space: It is used for reflective foils in satellites. This isn't exactly a high volume market.
* Formula 1: It is used to shield engines in parts, also not a high volume market
* Aeronautics: Sometimes used as coating on cockpit windows, not very common, cheaper alternatives exist.
* Electronics: Due to its price contested by a variety of alternatives. Graphene being one of the contesters to replace it entirely even for high capital applications.
* Chemistry: not very many uses due to price and its property not to react with very much, mostly used to supply medicinal use.
Platinum, silver, copper, iron, lithium, maganese, alluminium, etc. have major industrial uses. Gold does not.


No, but it means gold has major practical hurdles in todays world. Hurdles that bitcoin leaps. Nothing will make gold go away, certainly not bitcoin, but that doesn't mean you can turn a blind eye towards its problem.

Because the internal price level depends on exchange rates. You're not existing in a vacuum. To run your dandy lifestyle you import a shitton of goods. Which you rack up in a trade deficit, all the while racking up massive domestic debt. If other countries wouldn't peg their currency against yours, you would lose the ability to import goods since you couldn't afford what others want for them.
Your mickey mouse government fights the inflation of the USD even though an inflation is the correct economic response to printing money like mad and racking up insane debt. Morever a cheap doller would stimulate export which would create jobs in the US manufacturing base and make US labor competitive on the international market.
Yes admitting the USD inflation rather than trying every parlor trick to hide it would be painful. But if you'd have accepted it, you'd be out of a recession right now. FFS the great depression has soon lasted shorter than the greater depression of 2008.

Correct. But in situations where there is tons of volatility and you don't know which way is up or down or even where low or high is, there's an answer. Average. Buy small positions regular over time for a fixed amount of $. You will get a fair average price over the timeframe you picked to buy in.
Sure it's not as exciting as gambling on tops and bottoms, but it's a lot more safe and you will be beating the market long term. Top/Bottom picking is nearly impossible anyway. More so in a market being manipulated by exchanges and HFT players. So just don't play that game.

Given the same scenario, 1 lump, random time, you have a probability of 53.3% to do 10x worse then DCA but you only have a 0.3% chance to do 10x better than DCA. With historical bitcoin prices the only way to do 10x better than average is to have bought with your entire $10'000 when it was $0.05/btc.
If you bought for your entire $10'000 at any price higher than $5.8/btc then you will automatically land in the 53% bucket doing 10x worse than DCA.

So we're left with Silver and Gold. You could apply different criteria (like oxydation and reactivity to most reactants here, where gold draws a blank, and you'd arrive at the same concolusion).
So what chemical properties does gold have that make it useful for anything? The answer is: None. Gold shows no chemical reaction to anything (except aqua regia, but that's a pretty useless reaction). Does it have any other practical use?
* It's a good conductor, but in most cases it's easier to use something else (because that's cheaper). And even so, the use of it as conducting material is a few tons a year, a tiny fraction of yearly production.
* It's a good UV and infrared blocker, but again due to price, that's only a low volume use like in airplane cockpits, astronaut helmets and satellites, again, only a tiny fraction of yearly production.
Gold is treasured in decoration and jewelry however. But that's a circular argument. It's treasured because it's valuable. Somebody who buys gold jewelry, does so because gold retains its value. You could buy very low grade gold for jewelry or just get stuff plated in gold, and it'd look every bit as pretty, but would only have a resell value of a fraction of that of jewelry grade gold, let alone fine gold. Jewelry is not an industrial use, it's half an investment use, and half a luxury use, that's nothing to rely on as a driver of demand beyond speculation.
So the simple fact is, Gold has little intrininsic value, and whatever value it has, is either tiny compared to global production, or driven because it's perceived to have value.

See, that's the problem right there, trust. There are two theories how you can establish trust in a network. One is the hirarchical theory (DNS, SSL etc.) and it's got its own particularly nasty problems you **absolutely** do not want in a payment system. The other one is network flow, which is a good theory, but can't work for irreversible transactions. The reason it can't is that in classical network of trust theories with limited flow along the edges (such as in advogato) there can be attacks, but the network can deal with them because they happen on the fringes of the network and don't largely affect things like "which where great stories to show". But in a payment network if the fringe of the network (which can be a real person with real funds) gets exploited (i.e. tricked into trusting a malicious node) not only does that person loose money, everybody that trusted that person looses money too, and on it "ripples".
As a best-case scenario a "working" ripple economy is a constant slow-burn of people who loose their money in mysterious ways, people who want to exchange but aren't trusted by the network, and longtime users who suddenly get expelled by the network at high speed because they made one stupid decision.

The global e-commerce market is estimated to be in the area of about $1 trillion anually. That's about $2.7 billion/day.
The personally conducted commerce circulation is usually fluid for about 5% of the total currency. Bitcoin matches this well with a daily volume of around 500'000btc.
Assuming about 50% of the volume to be for e-commerce purposes (a generous assumption) so about 250'000btc/day.
A price point of $500/btc would provide liquidity for 4.6% of online commerce globally.
It is doubtful that market penetration of bitcoin for e-commerce has reached higher than 0.1% yet.

* ubtc = 1/1000000btc

And before you'll ever realistically need to use ubtc it'd have to be worth more than $100'000/btc which is not going to be a problem for the forseeable future.

The critique of bitcoin as being an attention driven is dishonest. Yes, bitcoin benefits from attention, like anything else. However the price changes **precede** the spikes in attention. Meaning that it is quite a bit the other way around in fact, bitcoin price drives attention. And if I put it like that, it's not really surprising. Of course that little trick of inverting causality and implying correlation makes for a much better journalistic parlor trick.

Something doesn't match up. Police wouldn't go and just shutdown a bank out of the blue leaving customers hanging. I believe that's what a financial services company registration is for. You send in auditors to see if everything is ship ship in order not to negatively impact customers and business operations.
So either police ignored usual procedure for dealing with financial service providers, or the guy didn't set his business up right.
I suggest to avoid such incidents in the future:
* Any bitcoin exchange to register according to the local law as a financial service provider and obtain required business licenses
* To provide the complete description of their business registration publicly so customers know what kind of setup they're walking into.
* To publicly publish their record of conformance with inspections/audits they have to undergoe as a financial service provider including who did the auditing (which government agency).

The increase of the cap is in my opinion just a stopgap measure. It doesn't solve the underlying scalability problem.
Making systems scalable is basically making it possible to throw more hardware at a problem, and have its performance go up (hopefully linearly to amount of hardware). And there is a fantastic amount of hardware being thrown at bitcoin, but all that hardware doesn't make it scale any tiny bit, it's effectively wasted (or let's say underused).
You can only scale bitcoin in terms of transactions, as far as you can scale a single machine, it's network uplink, main ram and harddisk space. And while you can scale that terribly much in singular instances (like a supercomputer), you can't really make this machine limit go up by a lot for the majority of full nodes/miners (you can't make everybody get supercomputers).
So there's more required, just as urgently as lifting the cap. What's required is a way to make transaction processing distributed in a way that allows to scale it beyond the limits of the machines, uplinks and harddisks everybody uses to run full nodes.
I don't know the answer to how to do that, but I see that it is a problem. The first step in solving a problem is admitting that you have it. I'd desperately urge us to admit that we have this problem, and not just a block cap issue.

The nature of bitcoin, it's distributedness, it's cryptographic working, the protocol and it's fixed supply rule is what gives rise to the network supporting safe, irreversible, trusted transactions.
The value of bitcoin is inextricably linked to how it works, and how it works is inextricably linked to its value.
Like any brilliant piece of engineering, this one is perfectly working with the least amount of parts possible. Satoshi stripped away everything until he arrived at the most basic and elegant sociotechnoeconomic machine.
Politicians, regulators, countries and journalists don't understand this fact. Programmers, geeks, libertarians and security professionals do.
If a country attempts to change the way bitcoin works, by force, they will achieve nothing. The network they hoped to gain control of, will, like water, flow around the obstacle and allocate its resources free from interference elsewhere, in a fork of the blockchain.
Those investing in the "government approved" blockchain will see their efforts falter and their fortunes dwindle, and before long the government coin will be as dead as the obscurest altcoin will ever be.

Sure, but a range of other "hard" assets such as gold (but perhaps not silver) aren't much different.
Gold has few practical uses once you have it. There might be aesthetic uses, but that's another matter. Gold's beeing used in less and less electronics (ironically due to price). Gold tinted aircraft windows are on the way out. Aparts from making bling, the main use of gold is to put it in a safe somewhere.
The main value of gold is derived from the fact that you need to crush a lot of rock and dissolve it to get at the gold, which is hard. Once you've done that, all the energy, chemicals and rock is pretty much gone, and the landscape where it was is now a wasteland, the rivers and groundwater is poisoned with zyanide.
You aren't gonna get the landscape, rivers, groundwater, chemicals and energy back that you put into obtaining gold by doing something to gold.

I know that economists talk about inflation as measured against a basked of prices.
What the monetary base shows is how much cash has been injected into the system. As you can see, starting from 2008 this grew to a base that's 800% of the base then.
I can tell you that the swiss economy did not grow to 800% of what it was in 2008. In fact, the economy (like any western economy) took a huge hit after 2008 and was not growing most of these 5 years, and some years it was contracting.
So with a flat economy, and a monetary base that's now 800% as big, how much inflation did we have? Well, from 2008 to 2013 we had a yearly inflation rate of about  1%.
Traditionally the monetary base expansion about matched the inflation rate. This principle seems to have been suspended since 2008.
The burning question is, how can a vastly expanded base money, not lead to crazy inflation. Fortunately, there's answer to that question. If you deleverage some debt, and have a decelerating money velocity and a contracing economy (i.e. less demands for goods) and if you're basically sticking a huge chunk of the monetary base onto accounts of banks who promised not to dump it on the open market, you're basically balancing a rampant deflation.
To paraphrase, this is borne from the quantity theory money, and how you could explain what's happening. The quantity theory is not without criticism. However the criticism itself has also been debunked, and the theory upheld, and to date, the consensus is (somewhat) that temporarily the quantity theory of money may be suspended, but that in the long run it will emerge as the dominant force.
So, what all this means is that, by expanding the monetary base like we did (like the whole world did) we're racking up an inflationary debt. And sooner or later as the quantity theory of money corrects this, rampant inflation will set in as a form of "bill for the binge".
There has been no period in the history of fiat money, where this was not so. You can go back in history for thousands of years and observe the very same pattern over, and over again, if you debase the money, you will get an equal response in inflation eventually. It was true for the ancient Chinese, it was true for the Greek and the Romans, it was true the Wiemar republic and it was true for Zimbabwe.
Now, this is to say, it's worth entertaining the idea that our entire monetary system might just be in the early stages of complete collapse. It's hard to put a likelyhood or timeframe on any such estimation other than "It has always happend so far, without exception, eventually".
So the important thing to understand is, you don't know when the music would stop (or if it stops at all). It would just stop, with little warning, and everybody's gonna be in a mad scramble for the exits.
If you prepared beforehand, that can make all the difference between economic prosperity for you and your family, or economic disaster. The choice is yours. Just as say, not buying health insurance can be your choice, but if you get sick, it's too late and the difference between having health insurance and not having it, can mean the difference between prosperity for you and your family, or economic disaster.

It's called Sharia compliant finance, and it disallows for straight up interest. However banks are kind of in the business of making money, so they come up with ways around that. For instance a mortgage.
Western Finance:
* You borrow the money from the bank
* You pay for the house with that money
* You pay back the mortgage in monthly installments so the bank ends up making a 20% profit from interest.
Sharia compliant finance:
* The bank buys the house
* The bank sells you the house at a 20% markup
* You pay back the bank in monthly installments
In the end, it comes out to the same thing really.

The shares of Asic Miner pay about 0.08btc/share per month. So the share pays for itself in about 10-12 months. The main risk with the shares is that the share price could vary and that the amount of dividend could go down.
Having the dedicated mining hardware would pay better by far. However as is apparent it's uncertain BFL will deliver. And getting an Avalon-Asics miner is virtually impossible and by now insanely expensive. So mining hardware kind of is more risky, it might not arrive and you lost whatever money you tried to get it. It might arrive too late, and has become useless and will never recover the amount of btc you paid to get it. It might not come according to specification and be useless. And so on.
Shares on the other hand you can buy today and you know that ASICMiner is working their ass off to keep things going, so you have less effort and less risk, but also less payout.

* In order to use bitcoin (in whatever fashion) you need to price it. If you couldn't price it, you'd need to peg it, and that'd require a central control.
* In order to price bitcoin, it needs to be a store of value. If nobody would want to store value in bitcoin, nobody would even try to price it.
* In order to be a store of value, it needs to be de-inflationary.
Simple as that.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:01:34
If bitcoin being de-inflationary is a good or bad thing is completely besides the point. Bitcoin wouldn't be possible, if it wasn't the way it is. The reason for that is pretty simple:
* There can be no centralized component in bitcoin, because that'd require to setup a worldwide accepted authority to watch over bitcoins economy, and that'd turn out to be just wildly impossible to accomplish.
* Lacking central command &amp; control, there can also not be a central bank that provides issuance at a rate fitting the economy.
* So issuance has to follow some algorithmic scheme that does not take outside signals.
* So a choice, any choice is wrong. 1% inflation? What if the economy grows 5% per year, or what if the economy contracts? 10% inflation? What if the economy only manages 2%? There's no right number to pick. Any number you'd pick would be wrong most of the time.
* you cannot make a right choice regarding the inflation
* A fixed issuance? That's conceptually not much different from de-inflationary, the curve would just be slightly longer.
* The curve that satoshi picked is basically arbitrary, and it's no more or less valid than a fixed issuance.
* Bitcoin needs to be priced. If it wasn't pricable, you'd have to peg it to some underlying (like the USD, CHF, EUR, tuna-cans or gold). Who would enforce the peg? jep, that's right, no central control, remember?
* But how could you price something that's not a store of value? Answer, you can't.
* How does bitcoin become pricable and a store of value? By being de-inflationary.
* Why does being a store of value matter? Because it's what allows bitcoin to spread.
* Would you have bitcoin, if it wasn't de-inflationary? No, nobody could price it, and nobody would want to hold it, therefore nobody would want to use it.
It's as simple as that. If Bitcoin wasn't the way it is, you'd not ask these questions, because you wouldn't know about Bitcoin in the first place on which wouldn't exist.

DNS isn't basically decentralized. Yes, it offloads the load of serving domain names across many, but that isn't the core criteria.
DNS, importantly, consists of two hirarchies. The Root -&gt; tld -&gt; nameserver hirarchies, and the hierarchy of trust that starts at the top, controlled by the US government, and then extends to registrars. The same is true for the closely related SSL signing authorities hierarchy of trust.
The whole system is basically one giant completely centralized tree. And invariably some nodes in that tree get pwned, and when that happens bad stuff happens (tm). The further up a node gets pwned, the worse it is. Attacks on dot servers aren't unheard of, and although, if corrected quickly, they wouldn't shut down the internet, if you'd manage to shutdown all dot servers for more than 8 hours, we'd be in serious trouble.

Yes they are, that's why the SNB sold CHF to anybody wanting to buy it at a pegged rate of CHF1.2/EUR, and that's why the SNB now sits on a quarter trillion euros (a quarter of all euros in existence) and has increased the swiss base money by 500% just since 2011.
That doesn't mean they can't sell their euros and get CHF back and then destroy those CHF. Of course that only works if enough people would want euros at the time. It doesn't look bad outright, after all, the reason the SNB would want to buy CHF is if the EUR appreciates rapidly against the CHF, in which case everybody will be out to sell EUR.
The potential problem I see with this is that this only works up to the point where no player "breaks the bank". Once the quarter trillion at the SNB has sold off, one of their two levers to control exchange rate is gone, and if the exchange rate goes the wrong way at the time, well, tough luck.
I say it doesn't look bad, because the swiss do sit on a fantastic amount of euros as to make breaking of the bank relatively unlikely. On the other hand, hedge funds are known to get up to all kinds of shenanigans like breaking the bank of england, so it's not like the SNB would be safe.


That's just blatant bullshit. First of all, it's entirely possible that T-bonds default. The US has been very careful to steer clear of that possibility, but when you go from virtually zero to a teensy tiny bit possible, that risk gets factored into the T-bond price. Now, as to T-bonds being always "safe", if that tiny bit of risk default pushes around the price, or if the inflation rate rises above the yield of a T-bond, they're no longer "safe", they've then become a losing investment. By definition, an investment that loses you money can't be "safe".

Now, I don't need a 100% chance to take precautions. If you'd rate the chance at 10%, that'd still be plenty of reason to take precautions.

Right, so essentially you have a problem in that, a transfer to an exchange is slow, so you need to be liquid on an exchange in order to operate, whereby your deposits serve as "buffer" until you next get to equalize them.
An obvious way to deal with that issue would be to engage multiple exchanges, so that even when one isn't online, you can continue operations.
A problem with that idea is that keeping funds at an exchange jeopardizes those funds. Essentially this is a risk.
Fortunately there are solutions for risks, such as insurance. What you'd like to get is an insurance that can insure you against the risk that it poses that the funds you operate with could vanish with the exchange that held them. Which transforms this problem into something simpler.
It means that if you run a business the way you do, that requires you to be liquid at an exchange, that you have a business cost item (the insurance) to safeguard your bottom line from the risk of funds going walkabout.

If inflation (and it's correlated concepts like central banks, money printing, fractional reserve banking, over-leveraged debt, debt bubbles and bailouts) is the root cause of income inequality or not doesn't actually matter.
What matters is that inflation, practised by central banks, which are government entities (more or less), by a government run by the people for the people, is providing a means to defraud the people.
I don't believe it is the governments interest or job to help provide instruments to further income inequality.
There's no doubt that those in power would find ways to work around the inconvenience of not having government sanctioned inflation (and being the recepients of bailouts and free money fresh from the press, such as the holders of the federal reserve stock).

* Register a namecoin domain resolution for both Bitfunder and Weexchange.
* Transfer the domains to a non US based registrar.
* Reduce dependence on Weexchange of Bitfunder by adding additional means to fund Bitfunder accounts.
* Move Weexchange hosting off of US soil and companies under US juristiction.

Norway was dealt a blow from [Bitcoin]( as the government of Scandinavia's most virtual currency impoverished nation failed to reach an agreement to make use of Bitcoin easier for the local population.
"Norway failed to make advances in the adoption of virtual currencies," the bitcoin community said in an interview. "We've done some assessments on how best to service Norway and connect it to the global virtual economy, but regulators preferred to cripple their countries economy instead."
Bitcoin will have to treat Norway as a third world country in consequence, where companies creating jobs and economic growth will shy away from.

It's the newbie initiation tax.
Banks are closed on weekends, which means there's a queue of funds that's all raining down on exchanges on mondays. This usually leads to volatility and upwards spikes.
That's the best time to fleece newbies by selling them coins high, then stage a selloff, and buy back in cheap. It's probably also the whole purpose of the once weekly DDOSes.
It's risky to do though if you don't have enough coins by yourself to outsell the entire market, because you can't guarantee that you'll not be gripping into the rising or falling knife. Best thing is just not to panic, not to sell, and wait for a good opportunity to buy and then forget about monday altogether.

There are about 4320 blocks in a month, each with 25 coins. So you'll want about 8 blocks, or about 0.2% of a months reward. The current network hashrate is about 64th/s.
If you assume the hashrate stays about the same, your machine will have to do about 128gh/s to get 100 coins per month.
Current machine prices:
* ASICMiner is auctioning off small machines that do 10gh/s, bids are already up to 60btc, or about $6000 at the moment. If you bought 13 of those, about $78'000
* AvalonAsics is "selling" machines for 72btc that do 60gh/s. So for about $14'000
* BFL is "selling" machines that do 50gh/s for $2500 each, so with about 3 of those $7500
However offers are notoriously late (or simply never arrive), out of stock, etc. So in a couple months, those won't get you 100btc/month, more likely they'll never get 100btc, ever.

Yeah that doesn't work because pools include their own address, so you're going to hash their block if you get your work from the pool.

Butterfly labs is rising prices in response to bitcoin price increase. There is a risk however, and that is that the machine you order will not arrive for a long time. That is a problem. Let's assume it takes 10 months for a BFL machine to arrive so roughly 2014. 
It is possible the network will have about 1ph/s of power by the end of the year. So your 25gh/s machine would be able to capture about 0.05btc/day when you get it(factoring in slippage, invalid blocks, pool outages, what have you). So you're looking at a 200-day recovery cost to get your 10btc back.
Let's assume that in the next 12 months (to 2015) the hashrate of the network goes up to 10ph/s. Modelling your profit in those 12 months under these conditions you will only recover 5btc in that year. It will take you a total of 10 years to recover 10btc.
So by halving the hashrate and doubling the price and having eternal delivery rates (if at all) BFL is putting you at considerable risk of never ever seeing the BTCs you paid ever again.

Or just say, at your homeland, where the official unemployment rates are hovering anywhere around 7%, but those don't tell the whole story. The labor participation rate fell to rates to below WW2 before women entered the workforce in droves...
The truth is that people between the age of 18 to 35 don't get jobs. Any jobs. Not even minimum wage jobs, not if they have a PhD, not even in something that'd be actually useful like engineering.
If you'll realize it or not, this generation is forced to go different ways. Have you ever looked around how many young people are freelancers, wantepreneurs and everything inbetween?
The age of employment is over. The age of jobs is over. The age of social security is over. The age of retirement is over. 
This generation has already lived trough two two economic crises, and it's got to look forward to live trough a neverending succession of economic crises every 6 years on average. Acompanied by a neverending succession of calamities like the end of cheap energy, the end of the oceans, climate catastrophes, the end of cheap drinking water and the coming water wars, the end of cheap fertilizer due to the oceans keeling over. And all within an increasingly radicalized and dysfunctional government and an ever widening income gap.

I think it's important to put bitcoin in perspective.
The monetary system since the dawn of men has consisisted of two main branches:
* "Hard" currencies, such as gold, silver, coins, etc. irreversible transactions, store of value independent from any backing authority. This is known as having no "counterparty risk".
* Debt based currency, such as debt certificates, paper money, credit cards etc. It's what you call holding "counterparty risk".
The invention of hard currency was a major step for mankind, as we went from a barter society to a cash society. The first recorded instances of minted coins goes back about 2500 years.
There have been many currency inventions in debt based currencies and financial instruments since. But the one thing that hasn't been notably improved or iterated is the simple, rare materials based coin.
That is until 2009. On january 3rd 2009, more than 2500 years after the last hard currency invention, a new breed of coin appeared. A coin made for this century, for the digtal age. This coin is called "Bitcoin". And like the hard currencies of yore, it represents a safe way to perform irreversible transaction that do not require counterparty trust.
One might argue that bitcoin isn't a hard currency, because it lacks the traditional definition of being "backed by a raw material". However this demonstrates a serious shortcoming of the opponent to understand the modern world. Mathematics is what underpins our world today. The information age has been enormously transformative to every aspect of society. The information age is built on mathematics, it is the automation of mathematics (calculators first, then computers) that made it all possible. Mathematics in its own right has become the raw material we build our world out of today. Bitcoin is deriving its value out of how it works, and how it works is guaranteed backed by mathematics.
The reason one does not simply understand bitcoin is because for over over a hundred generations, more than two millenia, an appearance of an invention such as Bitcoin has not happened. Imagine you're a bronze-age farmer, and you've never seen a minted coin in your life. In fact, nobody you know, knew, or ever heard of, has ever heard of a minted coin. So this dude wants to buy some produce from you, using these coins... It probably might have seemed pretty proposterous.
Before there where minted coins, in the bronze-age people used "knife money", "ring money" or raw metal ingots (like bronze). But after minted coins appeared, they made these archaic forms of money look outdated and undesirable. Gold and silver coins are no longer used. We live in a world where we are used to see the only advances in money stemming from counterparty-risk backed instruments (like credit cards, e-banking etc.). Hard currency today looks as archaic as bartering things for knives, rings and metal ingots. So the very idea of a hard currency alone, as a means of exchange, will seem proposterous to us today. Let alone a hard currency backed by nothing than mathematics. And yet, here it is, here Bitcoin appeared. And just like minted coins made all previous currency look archaic and outdated by comparision, Bitcoin will make the entirety of counterparty risk based money look archaic.
@_date: 2013-07-12 09:25:35
Here we go again.
So sure, taking a risk to make money is... risky. But if you think carefully about wealth exchange and creation, or even life in general, you'll realize that there really isn't anything risk free. If you run a business you take risks (you use wealth to create more wealth and in turn convince some other people to part with their wealth for exchange). If you have a job you pay a fee (your lifetime) to get wealth in return from your employer, who is usually taking a risk (aforementioned) with his business, and so you carry most of the risk of your employer in different forms (you risk being out of a job).
Now we get to the debate of risk. Risks are usually quantified as the potential to suffer loss (and how much loss) vs. the potential to make wins (and how much wins).
Loss and wins can be qualified into two categories. Limited and unlimited. Limited meaning that to the change there is a known limit. Unlimited means that to the change there is no known limit.
Holding bitcoins is basically a position with limited loss and unlimited wins. Regardless of the probabilities that's a very attractive position. For example if you had bought bitcoins say when they where $1/btc then you had a limited loss of them going to zero (i.e. losing $1/btc) but there is an unlimited potential for wins (at the top they where worth 250x of what you could lose).
So, right, as they say 20/20 hindsight. Shouldacouldawoulda. But wait, could you have known that holding bitcoins is an attractive position?
A few facts about bitcoins:
* There are only ever going to be a limited number of them (21 million)
* There are currently 11 million in existence
* They have a lot of utility to facilitate exchange of wealth
* Their adoption into the real business of exchanging wealth is still in its infancy (compared to like CC processors, banks etc.)
* Use (by adoption) creates demand. This demand only meets a limited supply, and a finite monetary base.
* Supply in bitcoin is diminishing (in absolute terms) by half every 4 years, and in relative terms (to the monetary base) supply is 12% this year, less than 4% in 2017 and less than 1% in 2021
* Supply cannot be controlled by anybody, it's part of the algorithm that everybody agrees to use (barring 50% attacks) and hence artificial inflation cannot be facilitated.
* Nobody can take away your bitcoins by decree (like cropping depositors in banks)
* Nobody can control whom you exchange wealth with
If you look at these characteristics you can see that the potential for wins with bitcoins is non-zero. But by the factors mentioned (adoption, monetary base expansion etc.) you can also see that some of the effects will take years or decades to play out.
So question is really, do you want to trade bitcoins (in which case I think they're no different than any other exchange traded instrument) or do you pursue an investment strategy (which forgoes trading in the volatility and speculates on huge deep future appreciation).
Studies have shown that trading in liquid markets is little more than a random walk for individual traders with no other advantage over most other traders.
The history for bitcoins on the other hand has shown that holders (at whatever time they decided to start holding) that holding is a very profitable strategy. And the factors around bitcoin suggest that there is substantial potential for appreciation left for years to come.
For example, say you designate a certain amount of fiat X as what you can risk in a year for investments. Usually X stands in relation to your income (it's a fraction of your disposable income).
* If you bought bitcoins a year ago then you now hold 10X in bitcoin, i.e. it would take you 10 years at the same disposable income to double your position, or another year if you somehow managed to 10x your disposable income.
* If you bought bitcoins 3 years ago then you now hold 100X, i.e. you'd need to buy bitcoins for 100 more years to double your positions.
* If you bought bitcoins 4 years ago then you now hold 1000X, i.e. you'd need to buy bitcoins for a thousand years to double your positions.

A sustainable price is acompanied by a sustainable volume. If the price goes up (as it has done) and the volume goes down (as it does) it means that the market is exhausting its supply of buyers.
The market is also ruled by manias and busts in equal measures, and constancy is the one thing that rarely really happens in volatile markets. So expecting something to follow easily predictable short term patterns (where the price is purely determined by psychology) is unlikely to be accurate.
Lastly, while I appreciate the argument of "newcomer panic selling" I'd like to remind that there are people with thousands, tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of bitcoins on their wallets. The temptation to cash out, quickly, can be quite overwhelming. It is said that the most difficult decision isn't entering a trade, but it is exiting one. The fear of loss is the driver of most bad trading decisions.

A [pyramid scheme]( is defined as:


The pyramid scheme is not sustainable because it has a negative cash flow. The negative cash flow is created because participants are paid (outflow) from the proceeds gained by new participants (inflow). It follows that in order to sustain the cash outflow, a pyramid scheme needs to aquire geometrically more participants over time. When the influx of new participants stops, the pyramid collapses.
A pyramid scheme needs to be centrally controlled to obscure the fact that the cash outflow is sustained by the cash inflow of new participants. Most participants are not aware that they have been ensnared into a pyramid scheme. And no metric is available to measure it easily.
It follows that a pyramid scheme requires the following things:
* Promise of payment for the participants
* Payment of participant exceeding his contribution
* An organization operating the pyramid scheme
* A non sustainable cash flow (i.e. negative)
* The sudden and violent and final end of the organization due to cashflow collapse
Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme because:
* Nobody promises you payment
* It is not a organization
* Nobody obscures the facts of the market from you
* It does not have a cash flow
* Unsustainable prices correct themselves to lower levels
You might mistakenly label bitcoin as a pyramid scheme because the price development (at least in part) is driven by new participants and hopes of profit, which might be very similar to the behavior of a participant in a pyramid scheme.
However the distinction is that nobody is obscuring the facts from you, there is no man behind the curtain, any hopes you made yourself are entirely your own and nobody promised you anything. More importantly, bitcoin can react to unsustainable prices by price adjustments. A pyramid cannot.

Interest is bad, all forms of it, but Islam went about this the wrong way. Outlawing interest is fighting the symptom of the disease.
The disease is inflation and cheap money. If you really want to get rid of interest, you'll have to get rid of guaranteed inflation. Because once you realize that taking on debt could result in not being able to pay back the loan, ever, people would be much more careful in taking on debt, and creditors would be much more careful about giving it out. The only endevours attracting credit would be the ones with a very high chance of succeeding and that offer substantial gains. Nobody would engage in lending for marginal gains and substantial chances of default.

Well, the kind of service you get and the banks handling of funds is an entirely different matter.
Banks practise fractional reserve lending. I've got no doubt that there's no compunction to do that in bitcoin once they keep bitcoin. However bitcoin lending due to the rapid swings in valuation will remain a practise that not many will enter. Regardless, I believe that rather than just going out with "NO FRACTIONAL RESERVE BANKING YOU TWITS", it should be a consumer choice. If you're comfy with an account that is used for fractional reserve lending, click this checkbox, if not, click another one, your interest or account fees will be calculated from that.
Banks might adopt various schemes of revealing the stored bitcoins, I'm pretty sure that if you're clicking the "no fractional reserve lending" option they'll offer you an opportunity to have a look at your address. However banks do need to balance this with a need for privacy, it's not entirely easy to host wallets, share the addresses and keep everybodies financial details confident. Again this is probably a good case for consumer choice, what level of privacy you expect, and what it means for how revelatory the bank is going to be with your wallet.
So in the end it comes down to choice. More choice is good. A bank adding a service, if they give you any individual choice or not, still adds choice to the market overall, pretty much no matter how the service is structured.

Ripples XPRs have the following characteristics.
* They are centrally issued by OpenCoin
* Transaction verification is based on consensus (rather than proof of work)
* The transaction consensus depends on "gateway trust"
* It is not stated how that gateway trust is established
* The network/transaction implementation is closed source
* The "cap" of XPRs is so high as to be effectively meaningless
If Ripple wants to get "trust" among cryptocurrencies they will have to do these things:
* Give up the central mint
* Publish the whole implementation
* Describe the protocol to aquire "gateway trust"
Before that has not happend, ripple is basically insecure and prone to be wiped out by whatever government puts OpenCoin in jail or whatever script kiddie finds a flaw in their implementation or social protocol.

* Like earthquakes it is very hard to predict when a network attack will strike
* Like earthquakes you can say with a good confidence in what magnitude it is likely to occur, but you won't know the exact number.
* Like earthquakes there is nothing you can do to make them not happen

Well it's not called hyperdeflation if an apple costs $100 tomorrow, that's called hyperinflation. And sure, if the USD started to hyperinflate then BTCs valuation against the USD would rise. But you don't call that hyperdeflation because the same amount of btc would still buy an apple today and tomorrow (disregarding any apple/btc trading difference).
Since unfortunately many countries now practise "quantitive easing" against the USD (i.e. printing money to buy USD to prevent a deflation of their currency against the USD), these measures would ensure that any currency except bitcoin gets dragged down the hyperinflation spiral together with the US. And of course, that would probably encourage one or two people to buy bitcoin, rather than to keep their wealth in an asset that's worth half today than it was yesterday, which would accelerate bitcoins adoption curve beyond simply holding out against the hyperinflation surrounding it.

You don't seem to grasp how that whole thing works. There is a variety of things the government doesn't want to happen with money (laundering, unaccounted funds, drugs, tax evasion etc.)
Policing these activities requires to stop them when they notice them. But it wouldn't be practical to shutdown an entire bank or other financial institution everytime an account holder at these companies does something shady that shows up on their radar. So in order to avoid having to shutdown entire banks, they created a money transmitter registration. It means that they can ask the money transmitter to shutdown the accounts where the shady activity showed up.
Mtgox not having obtained a money transmitter registration means they cannot be nice to Mtgox. They have to move up the foodchain to the next company that actually is a money transmitter, which is Mtgoxes bank. They wouldn't stop there. If Mtgoxes bank wouldn't have a registration, they'd just move up the foodchain more until they find somebody with a registration.
This is just how it works. You might not like it, but that's how it is. Mtgoxes business isn't running your anarcho-rebellion for you. Their business is keeping the exchange ticking. They can't do that if the government freezes their accounts.

It won't work. But first we need to understand negative interest, and to do that, first we need to understand interest.
**Negative interest**
Interest is the fee paid by the borrower to the owner of the money. It is an incentive to lend the money out in the first place. It is implemented as a payment from the borrower to the owner.
Negative interest, consequently, is the disincentive for the owner to lend his money to the borrower, because if he does that, he will have to pay a "maintenance fee" long as the money is lent. Which leads to an interesting question, what about compound interest?
It turns out that negative compound interest exists, just as its twin compound interest does. It is created by the lender not paying his maintenance fee on the loan, and the borrower deducts it from the loan he got, which makes the loan shrink, so next years compound negative interest is lower.
There's a snag though, the money borrowed was likely used, so it's not there anymore to "deduct from". But that doesn't matter, in effect the borrower is keeping an account for the lender now, and that account just hit a minus. But what's that mean?
It means that the lender not paying his maintenance fee to the borrower, means the borrower lent money to the lender...
So if the lender isn't paying his maintenance fee, the borrower then has lent the lender, and is thus required to give the borower money for the negative interest incurred on the borrowed unpaid negative interest.
I'll pardon you now if your head explodes, but what it means is that the best strategy to avoid incurring losses by lending money is by defaulting on your negative interest, because it might entice the borrower to pay you negative interest. Or, to simply not lend money.
And that's when the whole idea goes up in flames, spectacularly.
Now, the author suggests a way around this problem in a different fashion. He suggests to create two currencies one which appreciates over the other, at a fixed rate set by the government.
I don't really know how this solves anything with the interest rate, that seems like a tenous jump, but I can describe how creating two pegged currencies won't work.
Let's suppose the systems works, you create two currencies, currency A (let's call it upcoin) and currency B (let's call it downcoin). Every year upcoin appreciates 5% over downcoin, or in other words, downcoin depreates 5% against upcoin.
Why would anybody want to hold downcoin? That'd be silly, nobody would want to do that. In a really short time, everybody would try to get upcoin in exchange for their downcoin.
The downcoin, although in a fixed exchange rate against the upcoin, would go into hyperinflation. This is because nobody would want to hold it, they'd rather get upcoin. The upcoin however, would go into hyperdeflation, everybody would want to get it, so stores would probably give you generous price cuts just to get upcoin.
Now, when you're done with this silly dance, you've all but destroyed downcoin. And all you're left with is upcoin, which is now no longer deflationary, because nobody is using downcoin anymore. That's when you create a new coin, the upupcoin, which appreciates over the upcoin by 5% each year...
**Bottom Line**
You'll end up either completely wrecking the economy by making loans impossible (and the economy that you have is unfortunately built upon them), or you end up completely wrecking the existing currency you have in short order, just to end up exactly where you started.
There was many a country that tried every conceivable trick in the book to cheat their way out of the mess that they've made with their currency. Every single one of them ended up with hyperinflation.

Not only would it fail at its stated goal, it would just s spur the adoption of a fork/altcoin that would be engineered to make that kind of attack impossible.

Basing speculation on the instability of the financial system is, in my opinion, a folly.
Bitcoin's main price driver is adoption trough use, scarcity of supply and a decreasingly growing monetary base.
Use has grown by single digit factors year over year, and the monteary base expansion is going to take a very sharp turn downwards from the current 12% to less than 4% by 2017 and to finally less than 1% by 2021.
Of course those fundamentals are no guarantees for anything, but it does suggest that we've seen nothing yet.

Naturally there'll be opposition, that's out of the question.
I think that there are a few reasons why ultimately such opposition is futile however:
* While some country might oppose it, another country might embrace it. The one opposing it may find itself in the disadvantage, and might overthink it's position of the self-imposed handycap.
* Bitcoin is a protocol, stopping protocols is pretty much darn impossible (see bittorrent etc.)
* Bitcoin is a disruptive and transformative technology, much the same say like book-printing, clocks, steam engines, horseless carriages, airplanes, telecommunications, record players, the internet etc. It turns out that every single instance of such technology incites controversy, and in some measures fervent support as well as damnation. But it turns out that no amount of naysaying, government regulation or otherwise opposing activity can actually stop these inventions, simply because their transformative allure is too great, the monkeys can't keep their hands out of the cookie jar. And thus we live in the modern world, and not in some medieval dark age.

If you read what I wrote I said "solved" not "lifted". Of course simply lifting the limit isn't going to achieve much in terms of keeping the system usable.
There's a variety of things that you can do to address the problem:
* Optimize transaction format to be more compact
* The total size of the ledger isn't of much relevance (the client already works in a fashion to favor tree pruning), the bandwidth to keep up with the ledger is the problem.
* Introduce cross-chain trading so you can balance the load across multiple chains.
* Increase the limit somewhat as a stopgap measure
* Many more I'm certain I haven't thought of.
Regardless that doesn't mean that txfee profit won't grow. If transactions exceed capacity that the client can't provide, it drives up txfees while the transactions stay flat, because an increasing number of transactions compete for a fixed number of transaction bandwidth. When those scalability problems are solved, txfees will drop, but transaction count will go up, keeping txfee profit up.

Well, running the client is all you need to accept bitcoins. You'll want to keep your wallet secure though, which is at the moment one of the weaker links. For instance Java-Applet exploits are used to empty your wallet and stuff like that.
You could transfer coins to an online wallet, which is somewhat dubious of a gain in my opinion (the same malware will likely be keylogging your login to these wallets).
The safest way to do it is probably to go cold storage. WARNING, be really careful to read up on how that works, because if you screw it, your coins are gone, forever.

Everybody knows the block count because blocks define a chain.
To validate a block:
* Compare difficulty the block sets, to the difficulty it should have, if they don't match, the block is invalid.
* Compare the hash of the block (as a long number) to the difficulty, if the hash is bigger than the difficulty, the block is invalid.
* Validate the transactions in the block to be valid (is done by comparing the merkel hash), if the block contains invalid transactions, the block is invalid.
* Compare the credited reward to the current reward size, if it does not match, the block is invalid.
* Verify that the hash included of the previous block, is in fact the hash of the previous block you accepted as valid, if not, the block is invalid.

You should never invest more than you can lose, no matter if it's Bitcoin, or whatever else.
The bitcoin networks computing power is in the range of about 700pflops. If you add up all top 500 supercomputers in the world, they amount to about 160pflops.
General purpose "infrastructure" is pretty crap at mining, at 60th/s the current difficulty would cost in hardware about:
* $70 million in ASICs
* $700 million in GPUs
* $7 billion in CPUs
However most existing GPU based supercomputer installations are geared towards more generic problems, such as the Titan Supercomputer at 17pflops which cost $90 million to build, so it's roughly 10x more expensive than off the shelf hardware.
The government could make a large investment and come up with a superior ASICs design and use it. However the up-front investment cost is probably significant, and the hardware can do nothing else, and that would be a lot of millions to answer to congress for to play the bitcoin lottery.
Regardless of schemes to control the network, the attempt would backfire. If other governments saw the US trying to grab control of a promising new technology, they would too attempt to grab control, which ends up with them competing to complete the longest blockchain, which is exactly how Satoshi had that envisioned.

* His "IPO" was marred by irregularities and poor communication.
* Kslaughter did not manage to sell off the shares he wanted at the IPO, meaning there's a load of shares he's looking to sell off when price has recovered to his satisfaction.
* He is paying dividends, but they're not the kind of dividends that a robust mining operation would produce, and they are dwindling. The dividend paying doesn't make any sense. And this tickles my spidey senses.
* The dividend to price ratio is now 1392.6, meaning that with a weekly dividend this stock would need 26 years to earn a ROI of 100%.

LibertyReserve and Bitfunder are two different cases. Of course regulation applies to Bitfunder regardless of where they're based. However being regulated is only half the story, the other half is making enforcement happen, and that is where there are major differences.
Enforcement usually takes the following forms:
* Blocking of DNS resolution
* Hosting Seizure
* Bank account seizure
* Arresting of the operators
Hosting Seizure and DNS resolution is not a serious threat, more an inconvenience as the pirate bay has shown.
Liberty reserve was vulnerable to bank account seizure because their business could not operate without bank accounts. Bitfunder is not vulnerable to bank account seizure because their business isn't relying on bank accounts (bitcoin ftw!)
Both liberty reserve and bitfunder would be vulnerable to arresting of the operator, but I'd argue it was easier to get that enforced for liberty reserve because the operators where well known (a registered company) and where directly implicated in money laundering, which is a more serious and pursuable offense (fellony crime) than violation of regulations on securities (probably needs a while before it gets upgraded to fellony).

Actually that story is a bit more complex, but for that, we'll have to go back, wayback in history for a bit.
So the first fiat currencies popped up not long after the invention of the coin. And in some situations, coins where fiat currencies as well (for instance when they where made of a worthless metal).
However, none of these fiat currencies lived terribly long. The same thing happened over and over, people used them to practice deficit spending (and this goes wayback to the ancient Chinese and Greek as well as up to recent times with Zimbabwe), and printed more and more of them. And every time they did collapse, people did what they always do, they reverted to some kind of currency backed by a commodity (such as pressed tea leaves and beaver pelts) or naturally rare items (like specific seashells, knive-currency, gold, etc.)
So the important thing to realize is that the greatest accomplishments of human history, such as agriculture, cities, empires, renaissance, industrial revolution and so forth where built on the back of commodity currencies. If fiat had been around long enough, it would've helped, perhaps, but it never got the chance.
And it's not for a lack of "modern" financial instruments like debt, bonds, futures, options etc. either. Most of these have been in use since ancient times. Roman ports already practised futures. Bonds and debt are as old as governments and so forth.
So it's pretty fair to argue, commodities as currencies never went out of style. They're used, even today, in the age of limitless fiat, credit and debt. Yes, you read that right, our world today wouldn't go round if there wasn't gold. Banks, settle their debts between themselves with gold.
So, without going into the history of the creation of a worldwide central banking system, I'll jump ahead a bit to the end of ww2 and the bretton-woods system. The world after ww2 was hurting, because everybody had engaged in a fair amount of deficit spending. And in order not to dip into a deep recession, pretty much all larger nations decided to peg their currency to the US dollar. In turn, the US promised the US dollar to be backed by gold. So you can see that up until 1971 (a mere 40 odd years ago), the whole world was running on a gold backed currency.
The question is, why did that stop? The problem was that the US was living beyond their means. They waged war after war, and engaged in spurious deficit spending. So other nations did two things. The first thing they did was to redeem the USD they got, for gold from the US. That lead to the US gold reserves shrinking by 50% in just a few months. The second thing they did was to argue that the US engaged in dishonest behavior and that the bretton-woods agreement wasn't worth the paper it was written on (you could hear such noises out of france any many other nations frequently).
So In 1971 Nixon did the only thing he could do if he wanted to stop the bad PR and drain of gold from the US. He nulled the bretton-woods agreements. He did so publicly, by putting his signature under the legislation. And with the stroke of a pen, a few mere pigments on a piece of paper, the entire world went off a gold backed currency. The age of fiat had finally arrived. Historians have it that everybody was ecstatic and the imminent demise of gold was declared. Prices where predicted to tumble to $7/oz and then perhaps to something near $0/oz since the freed reserves of gold would suffice the worlds other use for hundreds of years. The age of economic calamities, bubbles and busts was declared dead and the future looked bright.
As we know that's not what happened. Adjusted for inflation, gold reached astronomical heights in 1974 with $820 and 1980 with $2350. It then had a series of tumbles that should bottom out in 2001 at $315, only to turn around and reach heights of $1800 again. The world economy went trough a series of worsening crises. Government debt is skyrocketing and monetary bases are expanding like never before. The music is playing, it's still playing, but for how long?
Wait, how can that be, I thought gold was supposed to go out of fashion with the age of fiat? Doesn't that mean it's worthless? Well no, obviously people wheren't thinking it was worthless, and banks all over the world still use it to settle their debts, because they regard such finicky things as fiat currencies to be an unsuitable medium for their business...
So what about today? Surely nobody is buying large amounts of gold now are they? The gold paper markets are in duress and just recently hundreds of tons of been purged from some paper markets onto the open market because nobody wanted the papers? Gold price has tumbled from its height of $1800 to a mere $1200. So it's now dead, is it?
No, world production in 2011 was about 2800tons/y, 2012 about 2200tons/y, 2013 probably around 1800tons/y. China has been buying 1000tons of gold in 2012, they've been doing the same in 2013. It's likely they'll continue buying vast amounts of gold in 2014 as they unwind their US bonds. Price is down on the paper markets because nobody trusts the papers. Meanwhile obtaining physical delivery of gold is turning out to be ever more difficult, despite a growing demand. The reason prices are lower, despite higher demand, is that paper gold and physical gold prices are intertwined.  Physical gold prices have not so far matured away from paper gold prices. However a series of gold backwardations points the way to a future where these prices will detatch.
So, as you can see, gold never went out of style. It's merely a ploy of political machinations to make everybody think it had gone out of style, as to avoid talking about the historically disastrous consequences of going full fiat. Everybody who still needs to deal with the serious exchange of wealth happily uses gold, and recent times have many big players scrambling for the exits.
Maybe you ought to overthink your fashionable statement about gold a bit, before you try to discuss it again.


All things being equal, there would be no substantial difference between inflationary vs. non inflationary monetary systems. The slack in debt is taken up by the abundance of savings and vice versa. But not all things are equal.
Inflationary currencies always need a central control, because the issuing authority needs to react to market conditions. Which means that, at times, vast amounts of money need to be injected so as to keep at bay deflation. You cannot afford deflation, because in a debt based economy, that's a very bad thing. But this has the effect of shooing people into investments no matter what. And, naturally, they want to go for the most profitable investment, this leads to a phenomenon called investment overheat. This is a bad thing, because the valuation of a stock completely detaches from economic reality. You can think of it as a resource missallocation. Vast amounts of capital flow into apparently highly priced stocks, on no fundamental basis at all. If you're familiar with the dotcom bubble, you should know all about this.
The devil is in the fact that once you get a decent asset bubble started, it's kinda hard to stop it. It's obvious to anybody that a lot of the dotcom companies where basically worthless, so, you risk a substantial crash. The only question is, do you get the crash at much higher levels, or can you induce it before it reaches apocalyptic proportions. So one of the ways in which you can deflate a bubble (or crash it it) is by inflating an even better bubble. As we know, this better bubble was the housing bubble.
So, this will continue, you'll see that the standard response to overenthusiastic investment/resource missallocation by governments will be to inflate another bubble with cheap money. And the reason the investment overheated in the first place, was because there's more and more fiat being printed, so you **need** to go into any asset than fiat more than before.
The devil is in the fact that the problem that fiat currency attempts to solve, was lauded to solve, isn't actually solved. It seems to have run its course, and, being a basically unsustainable bubble/crash cycle, that requires ever increasing amounts of debt and fiat injection to keep alive. If this seems familiar if you're familiar with history, then, that's because it is familiar history.
The folly is that many advocates of this approach seem to think that this can all be controlled, and that oh don't you worry we're so much better at economics today than anybody from just a few years let alone decades of centuries ago.
IF YOU'RE SO MUCH GODDAMN BETTER AT ECONOMY, WHY THE EFFING FRACKING FUCK DO WE HAVE FUCKING BUBBLES AND CRASHES ALL THE FUCKING TIME?!

Let me introduce you to the breakout pattern. It's when the price oscilates around a center and the oscilation get smaller and smaller and the volume going down.
In the orderbook the orders sqeeze ever tighter together nobody is winning while bids and asks pile up ever higher. It concentrates the resistance and support into an ever smaller price band.
Think of it as a pressure cooker, or a spring. It makes it possible for a small movement in sentiment to wipe out a large part of the resistance or support in a short time, and then the price moves a lot very quickly.
Hence, breakout pattern.

I just queried Mt.Gox on their registration and operation in Japan, and this is **what Mt.Gox said**:
* They are not registered as a money transmitting business because japanese law does not require that of them
* They have an AML process in place (anti money laundering) as is required of them.
* They plan to keep up with changing regulation and perform whatever compliance that becomes required of them.
**In my opinion** it is a bit laggard to do it like that because it's fairly obvious that registering as money transmitter even when they're not strictly required to be right now, would be a good step to establish a reputable business.

Now people've been arguing, well, bitcoin being what it is, it's probably not the future of cryptocurrency and something else, better, will replace it. And the simple answer is no. It's no because anything that would want to emulate the success of bitcoin, would have to be based around the same principle, the same incentives for miners, the same lack of central control, to the point where it'd be just bitcoin.

Inflationary fiat currencies aren't meant to be a store of value. Which is why anybody who held sufficient amounts of wealth puts it into many things but fiat.

Every medium of exchange would be inflationary by your definition. The definition is wrong. The only non inflationary exchange medium by your definition would be one that gets created with 0 circulation, and stays forever at 0 circulation. You'll find that people find 0 circulation less than practical.
Every medium of exchange, sea shells, stones, scrib, gold, silver, copper, iron, slaves, tulips etc. has a non zero replenishing rate. That doesn't mean that the USD wasn't deflationary during the great depression. Or that gold wasn't deflationary during the reign of the USD inflation.
If the float (a technical term) is smaller than the demand (due to whatever reason) then an exchange medium deflates relative to everything around it. The float of bitcoin (around 80'000 coins) will stay far smaller than the demand (due to growth, speculation, adoption etc.) for a long time, because bitcoin have not reached adoption saturation, and will not reach it for decades.

The exchange price is (more or less) decided by supply and demand.
Obviously SR customers represented some demand. But the coins that went into SR eventually came out again as supply (most of them anyway), so they are in equilibrium and without change to the amount of business that SR drove, the price impact is neutral.
It is a well established observation however that an expanding economy drives the price of what it uses to trade up. Why is that?
The reason an expanding economy deflates the valuation is because it requires more coins to be tied up in circulation/transactions.
For example, suppose the whole economy was a single person and a single shop to buy something and a single exchange and there are only 100 coins available at all. The shop lists a single item costing 60 coins. So the single customer has to obtain 60 coins to buy the item in the shop. During the time that the 60 coins remain in the hands of the customer or shop (could be 5 minutes, could be days or weeks) there are now only 40 coins available on the exchange.
Now let's suppose there is a second person who also wants to pay on the shop for the 60 coin item. That person would need to obtain 60 coins, but can't do so, because there simply aren't enough coins available. So how do you resolve that situation? Well, obviously at the price that the coins are at, whoever holds the other 60 coins isn't willing to sell. So by bidding a higher price, maybe those holders can be convinced to part with their coins, that's one solution. The second solution is that by bidding with a higher price, maybe you can convince the shop to lower its pricetag, such that 40 coins would be enough to buy an item there.
In either case, if a resolution is to be found before the other 60 coins naturally return into circulation, the valuation of coins has to rise to keep the economy ticking if the economy expanded by 100%.
So what does this mean for that part of the economy that is now lost in the case of SR? It means that price will take a onetime hit as the economy contracts by say 4% overnight. But the bitcoin economy overall is still growing, so in the course of the coming weeks to months, the 4% hit that the bitcoin economy took will be recovered by organic growth of the bitcoin economy.

It's called arbitrage.
* Bitfloor has a 0.4% trade fee, Mtgox has 0.6% fee, so 1% of the trade goes for fees.
* There is usually a spread (like 2%) so since you buy into asks and sell into buys, it's like 4%
* There is risk such as slippage, refiling orders, reacting to old data, let's say that's about a 5% risk.
* So you take a cost of about 10%, and you should be able to make a profit (say half the cost) , i.e. 5%
So the total difference for you to be profitable needs to exceed about 15%, which is about $20. If it's less, you won't make a profit.

I think appliance technology is a bit different. A VHS/Betamax appliance is useful to you, even if you know nobody else who uses one, because you can still record TV-shows, buy tapes or produce home video tapes. In appliances it's also fairly well understood by everybody that they will become obsolete in a fairly short amount of time.
But protocols are not like appliances. A browser isn't an appliance, and without a network, it's completely useless. The only comparsion would be that a tape player would be quite useless if nobody invented transference of video signals first. The cables are still there, the appliances have changed.

The total industrial use of gold of the yearly production of about 2000 tonnes is 10% (about 20 tonnes).
However that includes everything, and not just electronics.
* Aerospace: isolating foil in satellites (this is a very minor use), plating of cockpits (this use is on the vane due to better alternatives).
* Electronics: Used to be used in wiring but this use is fading out in favor of cheaper alternatives (new alloys and graphene). Use in connectors is also fading due to refined alloys.
* Chemical: not much use whatsoever other than to supply miniscule gold nanoparticles to medicine.
* Medicine: miniscule amounts as gold nanoparticles
Every practical use of gold is on the decline or disappearing due to availability of better, cheaper alternatives. The only exception being medicines use of gold nanoparticles, which is novel, but will only ever represent a very tiny amount of yearly production.
The use in jewlery is non-practical and mainly derives from its expression as value. Arguing it has value because it is "used" because it has value is circular logic.

Here's what people don't understand when talking about bitcoin and ask if it's the new MySpace.
First, they show an understanding that being the first mover, and having a network effect behind it, is a certain advantage, and they show that they can find other examples of network effects that are like it (a bit) by mentioning MySpace, which famously lost to Facebook.
But, their understanding does not include that bitcoin isn't a venture driven social website. For matters of network effect, bitcoin is a protocol. A protocol like Ethernet, TCP/IP, SMTP, IGRP, HTTP, DNS or the Internet at large. Bitcoin the protocol enables people to participate in the bitcoin network, much the same way that speaking Ethernet, TPC/IP, DNS and HTTP enables people to participate on the Internet or speaking SMTP enables them to send and recieve e-mail.
Whenever you combine a protocol with a network effect, it has repeatedly been shown that the first to gain widespread adoption, tends to stick around for a very long time, for instance:
* Ethernet: 1973
* TCP/IP: 1973
* SMTP: 1973
* HTTP: 1991
* DNS: 1984
We are still using Ethernet, TCP/IP, SMTP, DNS and HTTP. All credible alternatives that have popped up (gigabit ethernet, wireless lan, IPv6, HTTP2, IPSec, SSL-certs etc.) are either extension to the protocols, or wrappers around these protocols so as to be basically backwards compatible. This is because it's nearly impossible (despite concerted efforts) to get rid of such established protocols completely.
So comparing it to MySpace is fundamentally flawed, because the substrate that MySpace ran on (the Internet) is still around, even though MySpace went bust. Bitcoin is a layer deeper in the protocol stack, and it has gained some respectable adoption, and it's fairly reasonable to assume that as a protocol, it will stick around for a very long time indeed.
And it's also fairly reasonable to assume, that like any other widely adopted protocol, it will evolve and change, but it will do in a basically backwards compatible fashion. So much of the way that bitcoin works today, will be the way it works in the future, just with certain tweaks and extensions to make it easier to use, more practical, more versataile and give it any number of other desirable attributes it might be lacking currently.
I really wish people reporting on bitcoin would do their homework properly, and spend a little time figuring out what the network effect means for protocols. Because it means something very different for protocols, than it means for social websites.

Where you mistake solving the blocksize problem with shifting the goalpost.
Without a market driven blocksize Bitcoin has no blockspace market ("fee market" is an oxymoron). Not having a functional market (with an equilibrium of demand/supply) is called a [market failure]( because no matter the demand the supply is inelastic. This leads to the inefficient allocation of resources (i.e. everybody loses). It's not a good thing.

There are only two kinds of bitcoin speculators.
* Those who want to buy low and sell high.
* Those who buy regardless and still have their coins.
And regarding a crash, oh, how I would love a good crash. You see, I'm in the latter camp, sure, it's nice that price goes up, but I'm not interested in the short game. And price going up means I get less and less coins for the capital I can spare. But a good crash, suddenly my bitcoin buying power would be rised by orders of magnitude.

Here's how it is. Due to fiat not being withdrawable the Gox exchange rate is basically funny money, the kind that you'll be more familiar with from the fed.
It's a "market" of buyers only, go figure. Now you might argue nothing wrong with that, good for the price right? Nope, it just means that everybody on the Gox pays a 20% premium for their coins, which these esteemed buyers are probably not to happy about. That means that they are going to put less fiat on Gox. And that means that the gox price basically runs on empty and no refill in sight.

And yet that is exactly what happened with SOAP and the whole range of X-Headers and a bunch of, by now, standard HTTP headers that came to be widely used as to make it to the HTTP 1.1 specification.
Most protocols that get used, see a few pieces of functionality tacked on by proprietary vendors in the hopes to give it some additional usefulness so as to make it more likely to sell their own technology.
I think what you mean is that there would never have been an incompatible alternative to HTTP. That might be true, but that's probably more of a quirk of HTTPs history than a rule.
* Ethernet competed initially with Token Ring and Token Bus.
* TCP/IP competed with SNA, XNS etc.
* POP somewhat competes with IMAP and vice versa
* SOAP competes with Corba, Ice,  XML-RPC, JSON-RPC and so forth.
* IMAP competes with IMAP3 (yeah that's as confusing to you as to everybody)
But you get the point. Some protocols don't have competitors, some do. If the protocol is infrastructurally vital (such as Ethernet and TCP/IP) then it tends to entrench fairly quickly. If it's already satisfying a lot of usecases, perhaps in conjunction with a bunch of competing protocols, they become a suite (such as POP, IMAP and SMTP and IMAP). If they're solving a pretty complex problem in an unsatisfactory fashion, there is no winner, and the whole paradign kind of dies out (seen anybody using SOAP, Corba or Ice lately?).
In regards to bitcoin, I think it's fair to say that in its field, it's infrastructurally vital. You can't do cryptocommerce without it. So the question basically boils down to this:
* Is bitcoin solving a problem in an unsatisfactory fashion (along with all the altcoins) and will it eventually die out? Possible, but that's got nothing to do with the altcoins. SOAP isn't hated because of Corba, it's hated because it's shit.
* Is bitcoin part of a protocol suite that will develop, that'll include Bitcoin, Namecoin, Litecoin or whatever elese? It's possible, who knows.

It's not that simple. Valuation is a function of supply and demand. Demand is a function of use and of speculation. It is likely that a large part of the demand (probably the larger part) is speculation. Supply is driven largely by valuation (the higher it edges, the more it comples people to sell).
Speculation is a major driver for bitcoin price, just like speculation is the major driver of any market traded security, commodity and currency.
Speculation can be separated into short term and long term speculation. Taking the long view, short term speculation is simply white noise. Long term speculation is what defines the price long term.
Long term speculation needs to answer two fundamental questions: 1) What is the expected "end-game" price? 2) How likely is the bitcoin to reach the "end-game".
For example, if you expect bitcoin to reach an end-game valuation of $1m and you think it's say 20% likely it will reach that, then your effective valuation of bitcoin is $200k.
The valuation reflects the consensus about future price times the consensus about the likelyhood to reach that price. I.e. if everybody agreed that bitcoin was 100% likely to reach $1m, the valuation would be $1m tomorrow. If everybody agreed that it was 100% likely to fall to $0, the valuation would be $0 tomorrow.
Valuations tend to be forward efficient, they do not by far and large reflect the current state.

* No bank has established a bitcoin exchange. Banks already have all the required licenses to do that. If either of the big ones where to make a move, they can instantly become one of the top exchanges and wipe the floor with the competition for years to come.
* A wallet service run by a bank would be a welcome addition to the infrastructure. It's one of these things people would, you know, actually pay to have an account.
* In cities, ATMs can be found everywhere. And for support and security reasons, a lot of them have cameras. If they'd update the software on these to read a QR-code they can use them to dispense bitcoin for cash, from your bitcoin account, from your cash account or accept bitcoin to deposit into your bitcoin account, convert to cash and deposit in your cash account or convert to cash to pay out. Again, they could wipe the floor with the competition for years to come.

Charting is an inexact art of course, but here's the reason why you do it like OPs chart did it.
* Logarithmic displays show the percentage movement of a market better. As price rises, so does volatility proportionally, and so do lows and highs. Linear charts don't show this and often look like a confusing jumble of hockey sticks, which they aren't.
* Rising trend lines are tangents trough the lows because people willing to buy into lows are the market makers there. It is more painful to buy into falling lows and it shows conviction of the support base.
* Since a peak on this dimension is missing, a parallel line to the support line at a distance to the last peak is a reasonable (although more inaccurate) assumption.
That being said, again, there is no body of evidence that supports chartists. I like to doodle on charts as well, but in reality it's pretty much a crapshoot. Prediction rates are no better than throwing a dice.

It's pretty simple really. Whatever source of income you have, if you are not in debt it provides you with a portion of "disposable income".
You might want to save some of that income in order not to just shift the entire risk, and then invest another portion of that income. Either part of your income could become worthless, but it is unlikely they become worthless at the same time if you diversify correctly.
And when it comes to reinvesting you should not risk more than 10% of your appreciated investiment into reinvesting into a investment you feel is under-appreciated.

It's always an unlucky combination of events. See, doing high performance, reliable hosting isn't easy. That's no secret. Learning how to do it is not easy. Paying for it is not easy. Keeping it running is not easy. It's all not easy. The difference between BTC24 and Mtgox is that Mtgox is a couple years ahead in the learning curve. Some exchanges never make it past their infantile phase of figuring stuff out. Some do. BTC24 is not there yet, obviously, by a long shot.
And yet, all these problems for the most part are known. You can hire people who know what they're doing. You can migitate the likelyhood "unlucky combination events". But it costs money. And that costs a decision to do it right, and financial backing to get you there.
The "Oh we'll figure it out underway" route of opening an exchange is not how you're gonna tackle the Mtgox problem.

Debt crises come about because money is inflationary, leading to the phenomenon that people are eager to take up debt because they know that as time passes and their income rises, they will have an easier time of repaying it.
The term for this phenomenon is "cheap money". Cheap, because banks are eager to give it away willingly in ever greater number with ever decreasing guarantees because they know the quicker they can sucker somebody into deep debt, the more likely they are to make money off that bet.
In the case of mortgages the willingness of banks to grant cheap money to just about anybody lead to a real-estate bubble.
In turn people where willing to get even deeper into debt to aquire real estate vastly overpriced. The crisis happened when the rest of the economy was slowing down and people realized that they where sitting on a gigantic pile of debt, with shrinking wages, for a property that was vastly overpriced.
Banks realized this a bit sooner than homeowners did, and they repackaged the mortages that are risky (underwater, i.e. not likely to repay) into clever financial instruments that hid their true risk, so they could resell that debt to conservative financial institutions such as pension funds.
When it actually happened that the real estate bubble popped and people began defaulting en-masse on their mortgages all together, that's when shit hit the fan in 2008 and triggered the biggest recession since the great depression.
And in **response** to the sudden impending doom of those financial institutions that did very bad things, the governments the world over bailed them out, instead of letting them fail. They did not bail out homeowners. They didn't bail out an ever struggling under middle class. No, they shoved freshly minted money right into the throats of the very people that caused the crisis in the first place, thus debasing everybodies elses wealth in the process.
As a response to that the USD hit its lowest valuation in history when it was trading at chf0.6/usd for a while, and the currency crisis is still far from over as now the governments of various countries have enacted "quantitive easing" which is basically a shitty way of saying "bailing out the USD without our GDP"
All of this would not have happened if you had not given control of the issuence of the carrier of wealth to the hands of the government, hence not triggering the phenomenon of cheap money, avoiding a debt crisis and avoiding the governments the world over to be forced to bail out the USD in response.
How's that for you Nate, got another stupid ass question to field?

It makes little sense because both Litecoin and Bitcoin are protocols, but one has substantial adoption, and the other has not. In protocols, once adoption occurs, it is deeply entrenched to the point of it being easier to tack onto the prevalent protocol than come up with something better that doesn't work with the old system.
Regarding Litecoin, merely using a different hashing algorithm doesn't constitute a significant invention to make it even worthwhile to consider. If you want something worthwhile to consider, somebody would have to come up with an altcoin, that's as much better than bitcoin, than bitcoin is better than paypal or CCs. That's just not gonna happen, not because it can't happen, merely because the chance for that would be astronomically small. You might also get hit by an asteroid tomorrow, chances are it's not worth spending time worrying about.

Do the math. Banks receive $100 from a depositor, they give the depositor 0.8% interest on that. Then they turn around and make those $100 to by fractional reserve banking $1000, and loan it out at rates around 5%. That means that $0.8 go to depositors, for enabling the bank to collect $50 in interest to whomever they loan it to. Which means that $100 stuck in a bank will perpetually generate $49.2/anually in income for the bank.

That's not even the point. You'll hardly find somebody serious about bitcoin who thinks it'll replace other currencies. It'll compete with other currency, yes, in some spaces that are poorly served by them. But it'll also co-exist with other currencies.
For instance, taking on loans and going into debt in bitcoin is never going to be a very popular thing. You'll need some reliance that somebody will just keep printing vast sums of money. Fiat fills that bill perfectly. Whatever else, you'll be **guaranteed** they'll print vast amounts of it in the future.

I posited the following theory: Bitcoin is used by people, excactly because it works like bitcoin does. And if governments interfere with how bitcoin works (like say dictating the supply, or mandating tainted coins etc.), that means that whoever supports that "flavor" has effectively created an altcoin. Now an altcoin by itself, still needs to be a viable cryptocurrency, in both the technical and economic sense. And things such as willy-nilly supply of coins compromise the technical and economic feasability of a cryptocoin, those who like bitcoin just like it is (the vast majority) will simply ignore the forked blockchain and keep operating on the one supported by the vast majority of miners. This is the first way in which the network will flow around the obstructions somebody might put in its way.
When a country makes bitcoins life hard, that doesn't mean that other countries will, and it means that the volume (and economic benefits) that stem from bitcoin, will simply be benefitting another country more than the one that made bitcoins life difficult. This is the second way in which the network routes around an obstruction. And before you think this is some kind of fringe effect, it is currently happening. Bitcoin is starting to benefit China more than the US because the US has all sorts of crazy regulations and China seems to be just ok with it. And if there wasn't China, there's the Canda, and so forth. In the end it means that countries will abstain from (or roll back) crazy regulation because of politics. Even if the economic benefit of bitcoin isn't that big of a deal for the respective countries (yet), when your competition is happily supporting something you're happily condemning, a fair question is if your country is being left behind.

Inflation does destroy purchasing power, that's not some fiction. And it disadvantages the the less well off substantially in insidious ways.
**Central banking**
The power of the government to print money directly benefits those with more power in society, rather than those with less power. For example, if you print a $100 bill. You've stolen $0.00003 cent from every american. But where does this $100 bill go? Well, 6% go to federal reserve stockholders (so $6). Where do the other $94 go? They're given to preferentially to large companies that implement government works (such as defense contractors, etc.) and they're given directly to banks (in the form of bailouts and other more hidden ways). Because those companies are owned by powerful and wealthy, printing money pretty directly benefits them. But, it doesn't stop there.
**Fractional Reserve Banking**
One way or another the printed money lands in the banking system. Once there, it can be lent out again at a fractional rate of about 90%. Which means that if you inject $100 into the banking system, that this becomes about $1000 in the economy, lent out at a interest rate of about 5%/anually. So every $100 inejected, produces $50/anually in interest, again the banks siphon it off. If you're keeping track and do it with $94 of before, that means $47/anually. We can now add $6 to it and we're at $53/$100 that vanish into the pockets of the wealthy.
**The evils of cheap money**
Cheap money is when money is going to be worth less in the future, and interest rates of borrowing are artificially low. This encourages a behavior of taking enormous amounts of debt. The banks are very happy about that idea, because they're sitting on piles and piles of pilfered cash and they'd want to do something with it, and because it means that most US citizens are up in their ears in debt that exceeds their wealth and income by factors of about 25x. This means that the output of the conomy times the interest rate times 25 or thereabouts is going directly to the banks, again. It means that if you move $100 in the US economy, that it is backed by a debt of $2500, which earns interest at 5%, so about $125 of that activity go to the banks again. Now that alone would already be pretty bad. But, it gets worse.
**Whoops, we accidentially, the whole economy**
If for some reason or another the economic situation changes, and money gets ever so slightly not so cheap, a lot of people who're in debt up their eyeballs will find that their hopes of ever repaying a loan receedes into the future faster than they can say "wut?".  So their debt gets downgraded to junk status. Their homes get foreclosed and their businesses built on debt suddenly find themselves flopping on dry land like a fish out of water.
And the enablers of this clusterfuck, who're themselves eyeballed into debt, well, they get bailed out, from what money? You guessed it, it's printed.
**We accidentially, your retirement**
But, it gets worse. A lot of people keep their retirement in a special savings account. Now obviously that needs to outperform at least nominal inflation (the real inflation is quite a bit higher, but that's another topic).
So what these pension funds do is they go to a rating agency and ask it, well, which assets are AAA which we can include in our portfolio so we can outperform inflation? And the rating agency happily turns around and asks the banks "would you please give me some money so I rubberstamp AAA status on some of your assets?". The bank happily obliges, and gives them an instrument they call credit default swap. Now, by a remarkable feat of financial magic, the banks managed to make this instrument look incredibly good (AAA) while it's actually build on pure junk. The way they did this is that they split the debt somebody owes them into two parts, one in which they concentrated the chance of default, and the other in which they concentrated the earnings from interest, based on the idea that, well, not everybody is gonna default at the same time, right?
Whoops, they accidentially just played las vegas roulette with your retirement money, and guess where it vanished? Into the pockets of the banks, who saw this coming long before anybody would've told you about it.
**We screwed up so bad, let's celebrate**
So by now you should've realized that the financial machinations build on the concept of inflation have one purpose, and one purpose only, to defraud people who're not wealthy, and funnel their money into the pockets of the wealthy. Et voila, income inequality rises.
Now you'd think that those responsible would feel slight moral qualms about being this size of assholes. But, you'd be dead wrong. They're actually celebrating their outstanding achievment of screwing you, your parents and your entire present and future offspring over by giving themselves record bonuses on top of incomes that're 200x+ then what you're earning.
And why should they not, I mean, there's people like you, who go around and say things like "Oh that's allright, they won this one fair and square" even though everybody knows they've rigged the game against in every imaginable way possible.
**Financial Stockholm Syndrome**
I like to call your state of conciousness the financial stockholm syndrome. You've been taken hostage by the banks, and you seem to be in a state where you applaud them for screwing you over. It doesn't seem to make sense, but, a lot of people seem to suffer from this very syndrome.
Now, see, the important thing about bitcoin is, that it's a cure for the this syndrome. Perhaps bitcoin fails, perhaps it succeeds, but the one thing it permanently changes is how you look upon things that are quite obviously not right.

Actually salaries haven't risen all that much. If you're talking the top 1% yes. But already at the top 10% salaries have barely been able to keep up with inflation. And as soon as you look at the bottom 90%, salaries have fallen against inflation, in some cases, such as the bottom 50%, salaries are effectively flat, meaning that they bear the full brunt of inflation.

Difficulty of mining increases as more people mine for bitcoin in 2-week intervals. Payout in the form of blocks decreases over time as blocksizes shrink (about every three quarter of a year).
The power of the network is measured in hashes/second. The current power of the network is 80th/s (terrahashes per second). A CPU will be able to do about 15kh/s. A good GPU might get up to about 1gh/s. This is where people have been coming up with specialized hardware (ASICS) that perform the computation much more efficienty, these devices range in the category of 4.5gh/s (costs $140) to 85gh/s (costs about $2000) and up to 1.5th/s (costs about $20'000).
Obtaining these specialized devices is not easy as the suppliers are notoriously behind orders since demand has surged.
If you assume that a conventional multi-purpose computer (like  GPU) needs about 3tflops/gh, then the total networks power ranges in the 240pflops arena. If you look at all 500 supercomputers on earth summed together they only have 160pflops between them.
This is the kind of dimension that bitcoin mining is operating in, and we've just got started. Analysis of the amount of ASICs machines being shipped puts estimates on the network hasing power up to about 1ph/s by the end of the year (yes, one petahash).

I think you're both right and wrong :)
Yes new commodities and trade mediums have come and gone.
But also yes bitcoin is something entirely new. It's a commodity without any material underlying. That is genuinely novel. I don't think anybody really has any clue how to value it. We've all got theories, which might turn out to be right or wrong or something inbetween.
I tend to think that the theories that try to value bitcoin the way that commodities, currencies and stocks are valued are bound to be less accurate because they try to apply reasoning from past experience onto something that is genuinely novel. That doesn't mean that the theories that abandon conventional logic are any more accurate, but at least they're trying to attack the problem on its own ground rather than trying to draw from a history that can't provide precedent.

You can achieve this kind of pseudo levitation using a car made of gold and tracks made of rare earth magnets, or a track made of gold and a car made from rare earth magnets.
Rare earth magnets are cheaper than gold, and you'll need more material for the track, so I'll use that to explain why that's a pipedream. You'll need about half a ton of permanent magnets per meter of rail that way. If you build a track some 100km long, that'd consume the world production of rare earths. 
The UK rail system contains around 16'000km of rail today. If you wanted to produce a maglev rail system that's comparable to about 1880 in the UK, you'd consume the entire global rare earths production for the next 100 or so years.
How do you conceivably hope to practically build a maglev train, using a material that's about 100x more abundant than gold, but is still too rare and expensive?
Maglev train system aren't being built for many reasons, the least of which would be the abundance and price of gold.
You're essentially arguing that gold is valuable, because there would be a potential use, that can't be satisfied, because there's not as much gold as there's iron in the ground, and so we don't use it that way, but that makes it valuable...
If we could, we would make all our electric cables out of gold, but we don't, even though it'd be great, because we'd run out of all gold ever mined within a year. That line of argument simply isn't logical.

So in a span of a bit more than 2 years DPR netted upwards of 600kbtc. I think it's fair to assume that a large portion of those sit unconverted in some offline wallet he squirreled away, let's say 500kbtc.
Attempted murder carries a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life. Drug dealing of the kind DPR was doing carries a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life. DPR could be looking at a conviction of more than 3 counts of 25 years to life, and if I'm not mistaken, they can be stacked, so 75 years to life mandatory, and if he's gonna be a douche in front of the judge, substantially more and no parole.

I'm a programmer with a network/server background and I can tell you where the usual problems are.
* You have an uplink to the internet which has a limited capability to handle connections and bandwidth. If more connections are made or more bandwidth is consumed than you have, the network uplink becomes congested.
* The system needs to keep track of every single order and transaction. An order cannot be filled twice and users appreciate it if it is filled rather than not. That means that this is essentially a process that cannot be distributed, it's a linear chain of operations where each operation needs to execute before the next can execute.
* Everytime an order appears the system has to run an algorithm known as matchmaking trying to find the best way to fill that order. With a significant amount of orders in the system this becomes more expensive. The machine running the transactions has a limited amount of processing power, and if there is more demand on its resources then there are resources, it slows down and gets behind the queue of new orders.

In the first order form of curve fitting you fiddle with the parameters until the strategy performs favorable for a given fixed set of inputs.
In the second order form of curve fitting you withhold data from the strategy and fit the first set of data. After that you run it against genuinely new data and you curve fit the strategy to that.
In general terms optimizing any strategy against any kind of historical data across any division of data to the Nth degree is still a curve fitting exercise.

You're confused like many people in how to calculate risk and loss, and you're assuming because it's more than what you started out with, you didn't make a loss. So let's make this quite simple.
* you have $10000
* You buy something -$1000 which you hope will make a profit, you now have $9000
* What you bought ends up making $500 profit, you now have $9500.
* You made a $ 5% loss.
Let's run that again in bitcoins:
* you have 100btc
* You buy something for 10btc which you hope will will make a profit, you now have 90btc.
* What you bought ends up making 5btc profit, you now have 95btc
* You made a btc 5% loss
Now let's run that again this time we're going to use exchange $ &lt;-&gt; BTC, we start at a $100/btc course and end up at a $1000/btc course.
* You have 100btc, i.e. $10'000
* You buy something for 10btc, i.e. $1'000
* What you bought ends up making 5btc profit, you now have 95btc, i.e. $95'000
* You lost 5% of your btc, i.e. you lost 5% of your $.
See how the exchange rate does not matter to your % loss?
Now let's run a thought experiment again, this time we'll assume you start at 100btc and what you want is priced as $1000, we again assume that course starts at $100/btc and ends at $1000/btc.
* You buy the thing you want halfway in, say  i.e. you spend 2btc to get it, you have now 98btc.
* What you bought ends up making 2btc profit.
* You lost 0% of your btc.
See how the risk to btc for $ priced goods that have a promise to return btc changes as the exchange price changes?
Of course there's a risk, the price can go against you, which makes btc price slumps for $ priced goods that produce btc a bad time to buy them (try to time buying mining hardware to the heights that make the risk favorable for you).
But regardless of how exactly you do it, you buy something with an uncertain prospect of recovering its cost. And just because you bought it in $ and expect BTC does not mean that you did not spend BTC to get it. It might just mean you did not buy BTC instead which would have been more favorable depending on how much the thing costs in $ relative to BTC relative to how many BTCs it's going to produce.

There are no alternatives anymore, and that's what economists seem to not understand.
Put yourself into the shoes of generation X and Y (hey, you're on of em)
* Since 2002 the nominal loss of value of your wealth trough inflation exceeds 30%. During the 40 or so years you'll work, you'll probably see a wealth loss exceeding 95%
* That'd be fine if wages kept up, but they don't. The average wages before adjusting for inflation of the bottom 90% have flatlined.
* Often this generation already enters worklife with substantial debt, due to a broken education system.
* Jobs are hard to come, and employment of this generation is at all time lows, where anything between 25% and 90% of this generation is without a job (depending which ethnicity and country you look at)
* The baby-boomers retiring are gonna wipe out any social system that'd have supported the X and Y generation when they come of retirable age.
* The general consensus among this generation is, that you'll work until you drop dead for a minimum wage job, and then you can consider yourself lucky to have had a job at all.
* This generation has just been hit with the worst recession in nearly a hundred years, and although people claim it is improving now, for this generation it isn't. This generation has been left behind in any job growth there was.
* This generation is poorer than their parents, and they will remain so all their life. They have been screwed by every conceivable party. They have been screwed over by their grandparents, by their parents, by their government, by wallstreet, by the social system, by the labour market and by the economy.
There is no alternative. This generation is the poorest generation that the west has produced since the industrial revolution. The social contract is broken, and we are fed up with. This isn't our government. This isn't our currency. This isn't our future. Left with nothing to invest in, with no future, and no way to gain any wealth, this generation turns the future as they see it. Not as economists see it, not as the government sees it. Fuck everybody that screwed this generation over, it's gonna stop, and it's gonna stop soon.

I think 2.7btc/share is vastly optimistic. The dividends don't justify this price level. If you're going by a period of say 12 months on return of investment, that'd mean the per share dividend payout would have to be 0.056btc/share (paid weekly). The last dividend payout was 0.007btc/share. That's a chasm of 8x. I.e. if dividends chug along as they have, it'd take 8 years to see a return on investment.
So either the herd buying the stock knows something I don't. Or we've got another bubble at our hands.
Update: To the naysayers shopping for asicminer shares at prices beyond reason,  lists dividends for April 17th as 0.00696732.

That's nonsense. The rules of the protocol ensure that there is a maximum of 21 million. Satoshi made the rule. Now everybody uses that rule. It is 21 million because every 210'000 blocks, the block reward is halved. A block is only accepted by the network if it follows that rule. Blocks are balanced to appear every 10 minutes on average. So every 4 years the block reward starting at 50btc goes down, it's currently at 25btc.


The nominal inflation rate of bitcoin for 2013 is 12%. It's not deflationary yet. Hold your horses.
Also taking a historical view on currencies is flawed, because bitcoin is in fact truly novel. There's not really any economic history you can compare it to. But if you want to compare it to something, how about you compare it to the thousands of years that mankind successfully used deflationary, counterparty risk free, irreversible media of exchange. Debt based money has a long way to go to prove it can hold up to the test of time, much more than bitcoin which is in fact a classic currency brought to the modern age.
And lastly the theory of deflations causing economic harm is contested. But the theory that inflation causes harm can be demonstrated on many examples (the latest of which is the great recession of 2008).


Any market is subject to pump&amp;dump schemes. Bitcoin's no exception.


No, that is one of its appeals. There are others that are more important:
* It is decentralized and cannot be taken down by attacking a single point of failure.
* The infrastructure to run it is self organizing (by incentivizing miners) so it does not require some central authority to keep it chugging along.
* Transactions complete fast (10 minute churnover)
* Transactions are cheap compared to credit cards (0% fee, or very small fee)
* Transactions do not require counterparty risk (credit cards do)

The seriousness of an attempt to create a problem, and the likelyhood of it succeeding do not stand in direct proportion.
Attempting to undermine fungability by one party, will have "unintended side effects", these may include, but are not limited to:
* Complete forks (software and blockchain)
* Various forms of counter-blocking schemes
* Gains in popularity of altcoins addressing this issue
* Uptake of features into bitcoin addressing this issue
* Regional competition (such as China attracting business at the expense of the US)
The core truth applies: Don't let the geenie out of the bottle if you're not sure you'll like what it does. I.e. don't invite serious side effects, if you're not sure you'll want to live with the consequences.

I'm not disputing that the amount of hashing power (37%) of the network doesn't represent a problem. But the specific problem that OP mentioned could easily be mitigated by the "victims" anytime.
The choice of hashing algorithm will not in any way influence the problem of N% attacks by pools. It doesn't matter if you use scrypt, sha256 or prime numbers. The problem is that pools dictate starting hash and no-once to users, and then the users have to find a hash that's lower than target, that works with any hashing algorithm. Afaik there is no hashing algorithm that you could not continue from a given starting hash and feeding it more bytes, that seems computationally impossible to do :)
I don't think you can come up with any system that penalizes pools in some way as to make them infeasible.
In theory, you could change the way that coins are distributed as to make it unattractive to join a pool. However that has it's own problem, as you'd need as many blocks per time unit as the difficulty dictates to make it possible for everybody to get a teensy little bit of bitcoin without a pool. This would lead to other problems due to block frequency (lots of chain-forks and an unsustainably large network bandwidth).
I don't have any other idea how to otherwise make pools unattractive, let me know if you do.

So let's say you have $1250 and the price for a machine is $125. You can do either of two things:
*  Buy the machine
*  Or buy 10btc
To make matters more clear I am going to assume you treat not having the coins the same way as if you bought the machine with coins. So if you buy the machine, you are risking 10btc you don't have anymore.
Let us suppose that there is a risk that the machine is not going to mine 10 coins. Let's say it is mining 5 coins ever (not optimally efficient, arrives late, breaks after 2 years, what have you). We are also going to assume coins are worth a lot more by the time you are done mining, let's say $12'500/btc
*  You spent 10 coins and got 5 back, that is a 5 coin loss, i.e. you **lost $62500**
*  You still have 10 coins, you lost none, they're worth **$125'000**
That is the risk you take. It doesn't matter that the coin price might have gone up. You still lost 5 coins.
Let me propose a risk migitation strategy. The case I have presented is a very worst case (aparts from no delivery at all). How about this:
* Buy 10 coins now
* Wait and see if they're worth $500/btc in a few months.
* Buy the machine for 2.5btc
You might only make 4 coins in the end with the machine (some more months delay) but you only spent 2.5 coins to get it, so you're out on top by 1.5 coins.

I agree that there are differences between physical raw materials and logic constructs.
But, I argue that the difference is not all that important, because, our entire modern world is build on logic constructs and mathematics. For instance:
Without mathematics (i.e. computers):
* e-banking would not exist.
* credit cards would be practically worthless and unscalable
* Most modern architecture would not exist
* Secure communications, would not exist
* Spacecraft would not exist
* Modern science as a whole, the one practised in the last 40 years, would not exist.
* Oil and and other non renewables would have practically run out
* Our machines would inefficient
* Modern aircraft would not exist
* Modern medicine would not exist
* Modern finance would not exist
The list would, go on and on. Point is, mathematics has an incalculable value to us. And it can stand in for everything that we do, because without it everything would be worth much less. So it seems to me, to be no big leap to substitute a frail physical material, with the pure logic that underpins our entire world.

It's not good. But, it's not entirely bad either.
The good news is that such a scheme has no good chance of succeeding for several reasons:
* Not welcomed by anybody
* Bitcoin is transnational. Legislation is national. It's no good if you only get that scheme implemented in a couple places, but not everywhere else.
* Even if implemented, for practical reasons it wouldn't taint coins forever, that'd be silly. They'd just be tainted if they're anonymous, and they'd become untained once they're associated.
* Tainting anonymous coins, while hurting fungability, is great for scarcity, so to a degree, it's a tradeoff (satoshis million or so coins would go off the market, and a whole bunch of others).
* The system that would need to keep track of tainting would be hoplessly difficult to maintain and integrate, as is customary for things that a nation does, that need to work globally.

Keeping the blocksize limited long-term is not sustainable. Increasing the blocksize long term is also not sustainable.
The blockchain is basically a shared database and a single atomic lock. It will not be possible to transact the volume of transactions that say VISA does (about 10'000/second) using the current architecture.
As a thought experiment, let's suppose you lift the limit a bit and go for 10 transactions/second. Could this be scaled with multiple blockchains? That'd require 1000 blockchains.
Would 1000 blockchains be possible? I think so, but, it needs to work in the following fashion:
* All blockchains use a common root or they are not valid (i.e. they need to be forks)
* It must be easily possible to select which blockchain to transmit something to.
* The rules should encourage natural "balancing" between blockchains, so that if one gets under-served it's more rewarding to service that blockchain.
* Some way to make inter-blockchain transactions possible.
I'm aware that some of these things might be quite hard, or impossible. Neverthless, I have to believe that there is a solution to the scalability problem without centralizing most transactions to single point of failure service providers.

The property isn't unique to gold. A variety of alloys have similar characteristics, just as copper is an almost as good conductor as gold. If gold was more abundant than copper or nickel, we'd use that, and we'd be arguing that copper doesn't have intrinsic value.

See thats kind of the problem. There's a float of about 100'000 btc per day on exchanges. And there's capital moving them around of about $10 million. Some fraction of that capital, let's say 10% (so around $1 million) goes for long term holding (so the market won't see those coins again for a long time). That means there's a dollar-constant demand for bitcoin that's scaling with price. It goes like this:
* $800/btc -&gt; 1'250 demand/day
* $400/btc -&gt; 2'500 demand/day
* $200/btc -&gt; 5'000btc demand/day
*  $100/btc -&gt; 10'000btc demand/day
* $50/btc -&gt; 20'000btc demand/day
* $25/btc -&gt; 40'000btc demand/day
* $12.5/btc -&gt; 80'000btc demand/day
* $6.25/btc -&gt; 160'000 demand/day
* $3.115/btc -&gt; 320'000 demand/day
You can see that a fairly modest demand for $1 million/day plays no role at the top, but as the price falls it gets extremely powerful. You'll need around 0.5 million btc of selling power/day just to press it below $2. There could only be about 20 of those days with the current circulation before anybody that's gonna sell, has sold.

Bitcoin exchanges do operate autonomously. They usually consist of one company, no subsidiaries or branches, a single office and a dozen or two workers tops.
Getting the bond insurance and applying for permission are the big hurdles.
* Taking out a $50m bond insurance is something most banks don't do with a scrappy startup.
* But if they do, you'll probably have to pay around 4% interest, which would be around $2m anually, or about $166k per month. That's more money than a bitcoin exchange startup can hope to make for a long while.
* But even if you get that bond and are somehow magically able to pay the interest on it with no business running yet, that only gets you the permission to apply for a license. There's no guarantee that your license will be granted. In switzerland a banking license (comes at about the same cost and regulation as a money transmitter service business license in the US) is a police license, meaning that the state has to grant it if the applicant fulfills the required criteria (did you ever wonder why we have so many banks?). In the US a money transmitter service business license isn't a police license, meaning that the state can decide to deny it even if an applicant fulfills all required criteria (did you ever wonder why the US only seems to be populated by relatively few banks that are too big to fail?).

Actually we haven't, that's just a pretty arbitrary number. A paper recently released by an investor made the observation that commodities with broadly similar characteristics, move in broadly the same price band, which is largely determined by the available circulation and the expected supply.
* About 165'000 tonnes gold have been mined.
* About 30'000 tonnes are in government posession
* About 1'000 tonnes are in private gold assets
* About 70'000 tonnes are estimated to be around in jewelry
* It's estimated that we've mined about 50% of the accessible gold.
* This puts a market cap at current gold prices on gold of about $16 trillion
* About 11 million bitcoins have been mined
* It's known that this is 52% of the total supply
* At $1000 this puts it at a market cap of about $21 billion

The US monetary base which grew at a modest pace of a couple percent per year up to 2008 exploded from 840b to 1700b in 2009 (yes that means the fed was printing more money in a year, than the entire history of the USD combined). It didn't stop however, as it went to 2010b in 2010, 2050b in 2011, 2700b in 2012 and 3400b in 2013. In all it grew to 320% of the monetary base prior to 2008.
And if you think that's bad, the swiss monetary base grew by 1000% in the same period of time.
But wait, why don't we have hyperinflation yet?
There are deflationary tendencies, and the reason the enormous amounts of money printed haven't inflated everything away yet is because it's kept in balance by a faltering economy and debt unleveraging and a declining money velocity.
The root problem of all this is artificially cheap money (interest rates are set by the government) and enormous piles of debt, which are a drag on the economy and frequently lead to speculatory bubbles. There is only a limited set of ways to address this problem:
* Defaulting on the debt, just not gonna happen, see recent history.
* Confiscate wealth (bail-ins, gold confiscation, collectivism, what have you), that's also kinda unpopular.
* Print more money, keep interest rates low and take on more debt.
So in effect, the only viable solution to having too much debt and too much cheap money, is to have more debt and more cheap money...
I can see this working **just** fine, don't you worry :)
Oh and that tapering thing. See, when the US is expanding its monetary base by about a trillion per year, that actually has an effect if like, you only have a monetary base of 0.8 trillion, or 2 trillion, or even 3 trillion. But as you go up the scale, that amount of cheap money injection achieves less and less (it's relative to the existing monetary base). So when the fed isn't raising it's QE, it's already tapering. So when the next crisis hits, they'll step up QE **substanially** to keep the music playing, then, we're not talking about a trillion/year, then we're talking about a trillion/month. And when that becomes a crisis in its own right, as it's bound to be, this'll just step up, to a trillion/week, a trillion/day,  trillion/hour, and that'll go on until even measuring it becomes meaningless and the USD bills will be printed using scientific notation.

I think that the recent worries about the fungability (blacklist/redlist/whitelist) are overblown and think that these will fail on popular support.
What does worry me is the inherently unscalable nature of the blockchain. It's one of the hard problems. Some people point out that we could lift the transaction limit, and while I think that this grants some relief, it's not the way to "scale".
I'm a programmer, and scalability doesn't mean consuming available resources (disk space, bandwidth) to the max. Scalability means that you have some kind of architecture that partitions a problem into chunks that fit the available resources, and make it possible scale by having these chunks interoperate in an independent fashion.
For instance:
* [wrong]: "We use all the ram and diskspace on our webserver so we can service more users"
* [right]: "We design our website to run on a serverfarm/cloud, so we can add more servers if we need to."
It's important to realize that there's a fallacy in there, in that, if you focus predominantely on doing things inefficiently ("Oh we just scale"), the cost for hosting the solution spirals out of control rather quickly. But likewise, if you stick your head in the sand in terms of scalability, it means that you hit a brick wall while you're going 180mph.
Bitcoin can currenly support 7 transactions per second. You might get to 20, or 100 by lifting the txlimits. But you're not going to get to 10'000 or 100'000 per second (to rival existing payment processors). So it's a problem that needs a solution, rather sooner than later, as we're currently on an average of 3 transactions per second.

It's possible that the issuance of new shares will dillute the dividends. It's really too early to tell. On the other hand if ASICMiner is increasing their capacity before shares and faster than the mining pool, dividends will go up.
Like anything buying shares is a risk, and it could work out, or it could not. However not being able to mine (because there are no Avalon-Asics for sale, and because BFL might not deliver) is also a risk. For instance (hypothetical).
If you buy an Avalon-Asic now (which is virtually impossible) at 60gh/s it costs 70btc.
Current difficulty is at about 60th/s, let's project some cases:
* Right now:  recoup in about two weeks.
* In 2 months:  recoup in about a month
* In 4 months:  recoup in about 2 months
* By years end:  recoup in about 10 months
So in a very bad case scenario you will get your miner 9 months from now and it will take you 10 months to recoup its cost before you see any profit. While that happens difficulty also goes up, so the total turnaround would probably take 24 months or so.
Compared to this risk, turning 100% in 10 months is lucrative.
Now regarding dillution and ASICMiner strategy. They are vitally interested in not letting their share prices fall trough dillution because the next time they want to issue shares, they will not be able to get a good price. ASICMiner knows that they can only keep issuing more shares if they can keep up with giving dividends that justify their current price. They can only keep growing their dividends if they get a bigger piece of the pie to mine. To get a bigger piece they need to buy more hardware. To buy more hardware they need not only to sell more shares, but they also need the bitcoin price to go up, so their purchase power against a dollar traded hardware market goes up. I believe that they are trying to keep ahead of the competition by issuing shares modestly, by having a low dividend rate to start with (12 months to recuperation) and by betting on btc to go up.

Buyers beware.
Right now it would recover the 172btc you want for it in about 2 months just to get the btcs back.
But in 2-3 months it might be as much as a 12-24 month recovery.
The total amount of BTCs that thing will be able to mine is probably around 250btc tops. Since you want 172btcs for it. That'd be a be a profit of +78btc having moved 172btc. But that's a 2-4 year projection on less than 50% profit.
Instead of buying that rig now for 172btc, you could buy BTC now, hope it rises to somewhere around $500 in the next month or so, and buy the rig for 60btc. That'd be a chance of more than 400% return.
Edit: because I just woke up.

At issue isn't if a particular brand of currency satisfies the economy so you don't run into hypes and crashes.
You **will** have hypes and crashes regardless of what you're gonna use for currency (See the dotcom bubble, 2008 and so forth).
At issue *is* if the system you're using to exchange wealth has a property which is called antifragile. It essentially means, is it capable to withstand severe shocks and return to normal by itself, even if politicians and whatnot would do the dumbest thing imaginable at the time.
And in that regard, fiat divorced from gold, as widely practised since 1970 does not have a terribly good track record. In the short span of time it's been the rage, it has wrecked dozens of countries currencies and economics. By comparision, the gold based economy was going strong for tens of thousands of years...
It's really audacious to go and say, well, our economy, which has experienced the worst recessions in a hundred years, is better, because we're running it on a principle of money that has so far failed every single time it was attempted.
Now the thing that scares us all is, yeah, maybe this USD/Euro/Kynesian experiment, maybe it's gonna work, but what if it doesn't?
Can we go back to gold? No-ope, gold does work shit trough credit cards. Do we want to give up e-commerce entirely? Yeah that would kinda suck. Oh, but of course, by the time we'd like to desperately get back to gold, e-commerce will probably the least of our problems.

And with the coming eurocrisis, global warming, peak oil, peak lithium, peak copper, etc. there is no end in sight. I will probably like everybody else spend the rest of my life going from one clusterfuck recession to the next. It sucks, big time. To a large degree I blame the finance institutions for that.

Bitcoin pricing goes back to mid 2010. There where several peaks and regressions.
* oct. '10, $0.05/btc, 30 days to peak $0.8/btc 30 days to Low: $0.3/btc
* dec. '10, $0.3/btc, 60 days to peak $1/btc 60 days to low $0.8/btc
* feb. '11, $0.8/btc, 60 days to peak $32/btc, 180 days to low $5/btc
* nov. '11, $5/btc, 60 days to peak $9/btc, 90 days to low $7/btc
* apr. '12, $7/btc, 180 days to peak $15/btc, 60 days to low $10/btc
* nov. '12, $10/btc, 150 days to peak $240/btc, 90 days to low $50/btc (?)
There's a fairly good trend in that the runups seem to stretch out more. The regressions don't seem to have a clear pattern, other than that the longest recorded regression was around 180 days.
For whatever reason staying in a regression substantially longer than 180 days seems to be difficult for bitcoin.
If you consider the current state a regression (still) that hasn't ended, we're in day 140 of the current regression. That's approaching the longest regression observed so far. The likelyhood of a continued regression kinda drops here because it's quite outside the variance of the observed values.

I'm sorry for your loss. I've had my doubts about MtGox before (a-ha-ha) and precautionary measures have been indicated for quite a while.
The doubts in question concern mainly these areas:
* Liquidity: For any number of reasons (ligitation, frozen accounts, fractional reserves, bad business practises, operational losses, bad speculation, fraud etc.) Goxes liquidity in Fiat/BTC could be compromised, meaning that they hold less funds than they owe to customers. Issues in this area have been widely speculated about, and they've been given more crededence by recent fiat withdraw issues.
* Competency: The previous history of spotty service (outages, slow service, failing service etc.) suggests that Gox might not be technically capable of running their service smoothly. It is possible that a shrinking volume on their exchange combined with bad business practises means that their cash flow is small/shrinking or negative. In that situation it would be difficult to remain sufficiently staffed, or to attract sufficiently skilled employees to maintain the service. Credecence to this theory is given by the fact that despite widespread complaining about the service, it did not substantially improve, and that Gox going from being almost the only exchange, to being one among the top 4 or so with a shrinking volume, is poised to create cash flow problems for them.
In case of liquidity issues by Gox, it can be expected that issues such as yours might occur more and more often, as it would represent Gox hitting their reserves of btc to zero and are thus unable to service a withdrawal.
In case of technical competency issues, I don't expect an increase in incidence frequency (as the customer base is shrinking).

Any strategy has a particular purpose. It is important to examine if a choosen strategy serves its stated purpose.
An averaging strategy is designed to reduce exposure to volatility. As such averaging is very effective. However it does mean that you are going to pay a price (loose out on fantastic profits) for the protection (loose out on fantastic losses).
Weather or not averaging is good or not depends not only on the strategy itself, it also depends on your access to wealth over time and the volatility of the instrument in question.
If the instrument has a very low volatility, then averaging achieves no purpose. If it has a very high volatility (like bitcoin does, 25% in 2 days...) then it serves a very important purpose.
Your access to money also dictates averaging. If you do not have access to the amount of money you would like to invest (like most of us) and you do not want to save the money up to some far future date (by which time the investment window could have closed) then the only choice you have is to parcel out the investment into smaller "buy-ins" of the size that you can afford. In that kind of situation dollar-cost averaging (at a fine granularity) wins out against a coarser granularity of unstructured "buy-ins" by a statistically large margin.
To illustrate, let's assume bitcoin prices from the last 3 years and compare strategies. Let's call the two strategies dollar cost averaging and lumping. Dollar cost averaging is going to buy a fixed amount every day (to come out at $10'000 in 3 years). And lumping is going to buy N of times over three years at a random day, in a random distribution of sizes to arrive at $10'000 over three years. To compare the statistical likelyhood of winning, lumping simulations are performed a hundred thousand times with each parameter.
* Dollar cost averaging (average): 19350btc, 100% of the time
* Lumping 1x: 18% above average, 82% below average, 53% below 1/10th of average
* Lumping 5x: 32% above average, 68% below average, 18% below 1/10th of average
* Lumping 10x: 37% above average, 63% below average, 6% below 1/10th of average
* Lumping 20x: 41% above average, 59% below average, 1% below 1/10th of average
You can see the trend here. The more often you parcel out, the more likely you are not to perform below average. And the likelyhood to perform catastrophically worse than average drops off far more quickly. But even at parcelling out 20x over 3 years, you're still going to loose against averaging 6 times out of 10. The worst thing you can do is buy in one single lump. In that scenario you are going to perform catastrophically worse than average 1 time out of 2.

Of course, but it comes out the same. Government manipulates the exchange rate.
In pegging the peg gets broken by somebody betting against it until the government losses become so severe that it becomes unsustainable.
In quantitive easing the government prints money to buy foreign currency at a higher price than the market wants to go, essentially errecting a buywall against that currency. It breaks when everybody gets uncomfortable to print so much money that it looks insane, and the domestic course surges briefly, and then everybody is selling that government their own currency back at a premium.

I've mentioned that you could apply other metrics such as the resistance to reaction with reactants and come to the same conclusion. For instance if you wouldn't discount iron and copper because of abundance, you'd still discount them because they oxydate (i.e. rust) which is not a desirable quality in money. I've left silver in there, because of all the metals, because it's similarly rare, and survives most other tests, and even though it tarnishes, the rust it gets is relatively easy to remove (unlike with copper) and isn't very thick/flakey (unlike with iron).
The use of gold as a catalyst is new to me. I'm not a scientist/chemist, so I rely on source like [wikipedia]( for education. It doesn't mention its use as a catalyst. But seeing that platinums price is about the same as gold by now, that it's actually more abundant in earths crust, and that yearly platinum production (about 150 tons) just about covers its industrial use (platinum is a confirmed great catalyst), suggests that even if gold was a good catalyst, you'd still use platinum.
I've mentioned the use of gold as a conductor, but that use is fully satisfied by using thin coats of gold on top of another conductor. The yearly use in that fashion, globally, amounts to no more than a couple of tons. Yearly gold production is in the range of thousands of tons. Sure, we'd make all our cables from solid gold if it was as abundant as copper, but it isn't, so we don't.

Here's the thing. Krugman never knows what he's talking about. That is because his "method" of building an opinion about a topic consists of force-fitting into one drawer in his mental cabinet, and then makeup whatever silly argument to attack it.
Then, when confronted with criticism, he doesn't read his criticism, he mentally invalidates it and just attacks the critic.
If you ask me, Krugman doesn't need more criticism, or discussion, or a job, he needs a psychiatrist and therapy.
The disgrace is that journalistic puplications give him a platform at all. His writing is generally as illogical and deranged as that of pretty much all crank niche bloggers.

Sure there was, but that's not the criteria. The model behind bitcoin is as close as you will ever get to bulletproof. Technical snafus are a reality of building software, not proof that you can't build software.
Bitcoins model can be explained relatively simple, and it's soundness can be proven. But more importantly, it's soundness can be understood without understanding the a formal proof. It is simple, and elegant. The same cannot be said about ripple, or mastercoin, or your work.
The measure of trust people express in a system, stands in relation to their ability to understand it. You might well come up with a system that may work, even one you might get to provide a formal proof for, and the proof might even be disprovable, which might make it sound, but people would still assign low value to it, because it can't be explained in a few sentences.
And again, arguing on reddit, or bitcointalk, isn't gonna do jack squat. Your doubters, including me, can't prove you wrong. In order to prove you wrong, you'd have to provide something to attack. But you haven't done so. So we can't even attempt a disprove. So, further debate on the merits of your particular hobby, is really not necessary. You can't will being right into existence. You can however, if you're capable of it, errect a thesis that people hundreds of times smarter than me can try to smash to pieces, and if it's still in one piece after that, you might have a shot.

We **do** know how coins are created.
A hash is a string that is generated from another string using a cryptographic hash function (sha256) that has a particular property. It is relatively easy to compute the hash for any string, but it is extremely hard to compute the string matching a hash. This is the same technology that powers your e-banking portal of your bank.
The bitcoin network runs on blocks that are validated by everybody, every 10 minutes.
A block includes:
* The hash of the previous valid block
* The unprocessed queued up transactions
* A random component (a counter)
If a miner "solves" a block, the miner may credit himself 25 coins, and the transaction fees of the transactions the block contains.
A block is considered "solved" when:
* It includes the hash of a valid previous block
* All transactions in it are valid
* The hash over the entire block is (as a number) lower than the target (adjusted every 2016 blocks to keep the number of blocks at one every 10 minutes).
* The coins it credits the miner conform to the current payout (adjusted every 210'000 blocks to be half)
A miner will simply count up the random component until he has found a valid block.
Once a valid block is found, it is broadcast to everybody on the network. Cheating on accepting the block by other people is excluded because:
* You cannot modify the block without modifying the hash of it, which would be unlikely to be a valid block again.
* If you do not accept a block (because you have another one) you are creating a block chain fork.
* Eventually the longest block chain "wins" and all forked transactions are invalid.
* So everybody is very motivated to accept the latest valid block they see.

That what he listed as his prior business experience on AMCs profile.


I seriously considered getting some at IPO, but the diligence I did just didn't turn up anything convincing, and that's not changed. Now at IPO I'd have paid 0.01btc/share, the shares are currently traded at 0.0018 (bid), so I'm kinda happy that, for whatever reason, I didn't get any (who likes seeing an asset depreceate more than 80% that you hold?).

If it drops, you have spent all your capital buying at the top, and have none left to buy at the bottom.
If it rises and you don't buy you have missed out on a chance to get some.
So you average the price over time, you miss out on some short term profit, but you also miss out on making enormous losses on drops, you just keep buying and your average price you got them for auto-corrects itself.

To explain, it's useful to explan deflationary economies and inflationary ones. Deflationary basically means that there's no issuance of new money (or very little). That tends to deflate the money (but if the economy contracts, the money can also inflate).
Inflationary economies are the ones that never deflate, they stay artificially on the inflationary side, no matter if the economy expands or contracts.
One problem with inflationary economies is that that they are in a constant state of overproduction. People are just more or less incentivized to buy things, by means of their money being worth less, or much less tomorrow. Overproduction leads to all kinds of market distortions where society seemingly follows profitable avenues of economic development, that turned out to be nothing else but the distorted inflationary market.
A deeper problem with inflationary economies is the phenomenon of "cheap money", which is what throw them out of whack. Inflationary economies tend to gravitate towards a state where interest rates are near zero by fiat. Together with inflation, this creates a culture of going into debt. But this distorts the actual importance of finance, which at the present day represents more than 1/3rd of the non agricultural GDP and more than 8% of the total GDP. That's extraordinarily high for an "industry" that does essentially nothing. Because money tends to become worthless and because interest is marginal, it leads to debt and investment overheat, at the cost of actual production. But while production declines, it becomes ever more difficult to preserve your purchase power (less supply) so you go deeper into debt and investment, and so forth. This becomes a self-reinforcing cycle rather quickly, and it may grow beyond the ability of government to break this cycle. You can observe that the US is currently in such a debt cycle by the fact for instance that retailers and the PC industry report contractions in sales, yet stock markets hit record highs. How can it be that demand (and consequently production) is down, yet investment is up? Investment overheat, that's how. How did it get overheat? Because the Fed is printing $86b/month and has expanded the US monetary base by 375% since 2008. It's anyones guess if this feedback cycle is beyond control, or if the Fed is still in the drivers seat. Given recent indications that China is gonna stop buying US debt, it's quite likely that the US economic health is, by now, beyond anybodies control.

All of human society, good or bad, working or dysfunctional, including the biggest economic inventions such as agriculture, manufacturing, industrialization and a good chunk of the information age got on just fine in the eons predating naked fiat, up until to the year 1970 when everybody decided naked fiat was "OK".

That's a common misunderstanding. The commodity (bitcoin) is inseperably linked to the network (bitcoin) and to the protocol (bitcoin).
You don't derive any benefit out of speaking the bitcoin protocol, if you don't also accept the rules of the protocol that address how the accounts are to be kept and what constitutes a valid transaction. In fact, how accounts are to be kept, how block creators receive reward and fees and so forth, this **is** the protocol, as much as the more mundane aspects of how messages need to be formatted and how they're propagated in the network. You cannot speak "bitcoin" without speaking the entire protocol.

No they won't. There will be an exchange of $coin/USD that will not be 1. It could be 100 or it could be 0.000001. There's nothing saying a $coin can't trade below or above a USD unless you back it. You've just shifted the problem to the next cryptocoin instead of having solved it for BTC.


It is about the blockchain. P2P trading would have a blockchain containing accounts for $coin and BTC and bids and offers. The mechanism of price discovery depends on quotes, and people would look at the last blocks fulfilled orders to determine the next prices to trade in. Spammers would shift large amounts of trades between their own accounts to make it appear as if there was trade activity ticking into some direction, while in fact, it's not.

It depends. Some creditors would set a very high interest rate, effectively trying to stay ahead of deflation and expecting the credit to default. But that's not actually attractive to debtors, who know that merely paying back the loan will be hard enough. And the creditor is vitally interested to keep the risk of default as low as possible. So a converse strategy is a low interest rate with a lowered risk of default.

People are speculating that due to the auction there will be a larger dividend.
* Average weekly dividend over 2 months: 0.012btc/share
* Average weekly dividend over 1 month: 0.005btc/share
* Currently liquid trade price: 1.25btc/share
So it can take a share anything between 2-4 years to pay for itself.
The prevailing sentiment for a lot of the instruments listed on the markets is to assume a 10-12 month recuperation period. Asicminer may be granted a bit more leeway in that, since they enjoy more trust.
The price you are willing to pay for the shares depends on your judgement of recuperation period, weather you think it should be 1, 2, 4 or more years.
The consideration for that is how much risk it represents, and there I propose a fairly simple measure:
* You take the entire risk of bitcoin
* You also take the risk of ASICMiner regardless of the fate of bitcoin
* You take the risk of the exchange (which is unregulated)
* You take the risk of the stock price, which is not guaranteed to stay flat
* You take the risk of ASICMiner not being able to keep up with mining difficulty increase, that would result in lower dividends.
How you weight those risks is up to you. But I can tell you this, in my estimation the risk is off the charts. No investor would touch these instruments. On the other hand, no risk, no fun, and it means that the bitcoin community has these crazy instruments all to themselves.
I'd like to highlight a particular risk of the stock price which is the bitcoin block reward halving in 2017. By my estimation the year trough 2016 will see a selloff of the shares culminating in a permanent halving of the stock price. 4 years later, the same game again. Since you are loosing 50% in roughly 3 years from the high, you will need to recover more than 50% just in order not to loose investment. So any recuperation period beyond 3 years is in my estimation hugely unrealistic.
A strategy mistake I'd like to mention before it comes up is the idea to buy the share before divdends and sell them again after. The fee+spread cost for that strategy would be in the range of about 7%, but the potential reward is in the range of 0.5-2%. So you will make a loss of about 5% at best, even if the price stays flat.
My recommendation is to hold buying them until the auction craze is over, and then slowly buy in with a btc-cost average to protect yourself from overenthusiastic dividend speculation, price manipulation and from people who don't understand the risks and fundamentals.

But other than that, not really, if you're not entirely stupid, you won't sell a lot in a short time, that just guarantees you a bad price. Rather you'll probably use a little here and there when you feel that the amount it is of your wealth is sufficiently small, or worth it.
So as price rises, you're distributing your coins, automatically, either stupidly, or more wisely, but you will distribute them. And, well if you **never** spend them, then you've made everybody else a bit more wealthy, by not spending them.

The majority of exchange done with gold (primarily in interbank settlement), is done with papergold. Papergold, just like bitcoin, is practically infinitely divisible, yet it is also scarce. And like bitcoin it's not in any way physical. Papergold is scarce, because gold is scare, and because somebody who handed you that papergold promised that this is 100% backed by gold.
But wait a minute, so why exactly is papergold valued anything at all? I mean, it is just as bitcoin divisible into very small units. By your logic, that would mean it's worth zilch, or better, worth irrelevant. But it isn't, banks treasure it, so there must be a reason right?
The reason has to do with scarcity, and how divisibility isn't scarcity. But, to understand that, you need to understand that these are separate concepts.
So let's make a simple example. Let's say you're on an island, and there's 3 people on it, Bob, Suzi and Joe. There's also money on that island, let's say there's a total of 15 coins from a treasure chest, and everybody on the island agrees to use this for currency.
Now let's say that Bob has 10 of those coins, Suzi has 5 and Joe has none. So Joe wants a coin,  so he offers to organize dinner for a week to get 1 coin. He arrived at that price because he thinks that his contribution is worth 1/15th of the wealth on the island, for which the coins stand in.
Now, let's say the starting conditions where different, and there where 1500 coins in that chest, Bob has 1000 of them, and Suzi has 500. Would that mean that Joe would still price his service at 1 coin? No, because 1 coin would be 1/1500th of the wealth on the island, at that rate Joe would never aquire significant wealth compared to the others to do anything. Neither Suzi nor Bob would ever do anything for 1/1500th of the wealth when they hold 1499/1500th of it.
Let's change the starting conditions again, let's say there's 15 coins in the chest, but the coins are made up of really small magnetic bricks. Each coin can be divided into 100 bricks. Would Joe price his service at 1 brick? No he wouldn't, for the same reason that he wouldn't when there was 1500 coins, he doesn't feel his contribution to be just 1/1500th of the economy, he thinks his contribution is 1/15th.
So you see, no matter how many coins you have in there, or how finely you divide them, what matters is that they in their entirety stand in for the wealth present. And any expectation to obtain some of that wealth stands in relation to Joes estimate of what that wealth is, and plugging it into the amount of coins to go around.
This is how economy works, and that is why banks treasure papergold, and that is why the divisibility of bitcoins doesn't make them not scarce.

Everybody can (and does) make predictions. They're a dime a dozen. Predictions don't give you actionable intelligence.
Here's what you can do however. Ignore predictions and look at volatility, the state of markets that flap in the wind, etc. This immediately screams "risk" to anybody with more than two brain cells. So you need to take steps to migitate your risk against rampant volatility, inevitable booms and busts and against markets which go down in panics.
So if your goal is to use bitcoins for something, and engage in some modest risk speculation, there is fortunately a solution to deal with these problems.
The risk you engage has two sides. One side is buying and seeing a fall in prices, and the other side is not buying and seeing an increase in prices.
So what you do is you average over time. You buy a little bit every day for a fixed and small amount of $. If the price is high, you don't buy many BTCs. If it's low, you buy more because your $ worth more of them. If you then look back over the last couple of months, or years, you'll see that what you actually paid for your BTCs is a weighted average price. It is weighted towards the bottom (because that's where you buy more).
This will do a couple of things:
* If there's a boom you can enjoy the windfall of the prices being high above your average.
* If it just slowly grows over time, you'll see a nice appreciation of what you put in over a long timeframe.
* In a crash your average is likely to be low enough that you see no loss, or only modest loss.
More importantly, your strategy is based on averaging. It makes use of the fact that the volatile market goes up and down at high speed. Such a market can't hold any price for very long. If it did, which is the main "risk" of the strategy, it wouldn't be a volatile market.

* They pulled mars and chickend out from actually delivering these
* Their mars demo was pretty sparse (could've been done more convincing)
* The mars demo showed a **huge** device, which lead me to suspect they haven't actually figured out how to make them small.
* Since previous points wheren't confidence increasing, the lack of an equally priced machine ($20/gh) in the range of about 50gh meant that there isn't an offer from them I'd consider "worth" the play money to see if they deliver.

To some degree it indicates the age of bitcoin stashes. You can think of the price as a function of people wanting to buy vs. people wanting to sell. To entice people to sell the price has to rise. The higher the price, the more likely people are to sell.
If you say take 2 people, one has bought bitcoin at $50 and one has bought at $100, and all other things being equal, it means that the enticement for the guy holding bitcoins bought at $50 is a lot stronger when the price is $200 than it is for the guy who is holding bitcoins bought at $100.
So it follows that the age of the stash that people hold, to some degree influences how many coins are looking to be sold.
So if you have some metric that indicates the average age and volume of stashes, it tells you how much upwards price resistance there is. That's bitcoin days destroyed.
Lots of days destroyed means lots of stash having changed hands, and hence it's going to give less upwards price resistance.

This my friend is a classic example of fitting. There's a whole school of chartist technical analysis occupying themselves with this particular form of reading tealeaves.
There are two counter arguments against that form of technical analysis.
* Given enough data you can find similar patterns for a pattern you're looking at everywhere, even in completely different markets, or of charts not at all related to pricing. You could use climate charts or any other form of statistic, you could even just generate a random chart until it matches. It doesn't say anything.
* Thorough analysis of the attempt to draw conclusions from historical chart similarities on pricing have revealed that any decision you might make is no more accurate than a coin toss.

I think it's doubtful that you'll get non significant computation for a probalistic check on a proof if you want a confidence of say, 99.999999% for the proofs rejection.
But even so, that doesn't mean that the proof computation itself isn't going to be vastly optimizable. It might be more tricky to optimize and sure, requiring lots of random read access is prohibitive for straightforward acceleration. But it isn't an essential issue.
Unlike x86/PCIe architectures, a system-on-a-chip purpose designed to compute the proof of work (for whatever algorithm) can go pretty much hogwild and do things that conventionally just aren't feasible. Such things as using GDDR5 ram with extremely low timing latencies, using a memory switch rather than a bus, having the memory lanes be 4096bit wide, implementing gigabytes of tiered caches, adding hundreds of thousands of tiny specialized cores able to crunch in paralallell etc.
Pretty much the only benefit of switching to a more interesting POW is that it gets more fun to design the chips :)

You realize that Greeces and Spains problems stem from having high rates of inflation and going into debt up to their eyeballs, a situation which would not happen if you had a deflationary currency. Low inflation rates aren't the problem, they're the symptom. They don't stem from greeces and spains economy doing overproduction, they stem from citizens purchasing power decreasing, and the market reacting to that fact in response (by recovering the consumers purchase power with deflation). Of course that's shit if you're up to your eyeballs in debt, which, again, wouldn't have happened with a deflationary currency that the government can't print.
The Keynesian solution to this problem would now be to print a shitload of more money, so as to erode the purchasing power of the citizen, and the market would not correct, meaning that it's just an exercise in kicking the can down the road.

You haven't been in this "programming thing" for very long have you? I've been writing software for a living the last 15 years. Just because the obvious solutions to an obvious problem aren't obviously good, doesn't mean that there isn't a good solution that you don't know. In fact, most of the time you think that you've exhausted all possibilities to solve a problem, it's more likely that you haven't tried at least one you didn't know/think of before, than it is likely that you've actually tried all.
So, I don't know what the good solution is. And, obviously, you don't know either. But, we do know that neither just lifting the limit, nor some of the obvious suggestions are good solutions. Which most like means, there is an unknown number of good solutions, that nobody has tried, knows about or thought of before.
Now, I'm feeling fairly confident that the clever people writing bitcoin, which are far more clever than you and me, will come up with a solution to the transaction scaling problem.
Regardless of the presence of such a solution, it does not mean jack fucking squat for asicminers txfees expectations because:
* If a solution is found -&gt; txfees earnings go up because transactions go up
* If no solution is found -&gt; txfees earnings go up because txfees go up
If, as you say, intermediaries step in to provide the missing transaction volume, they will attach higher fees to their transactions, because they want these transactions to be processed rather than hanging around forever. Their business depends on it. No matter what way you roll the dice, txfee earnings will go up for miners.

Switzerland is a bank friendly country. However the business license runs to a CHF 15 million security deposit (about 175kbtc at the moment).

The argument presented makes the following logical fallacy: spending more money equals economic health.
The premise that an inflating currency encourages spending whereas a deflating currency encourages saving is probably valid. Although it can be contested that if ones wealth increases, so does the buying power, and in the end it's a zero-sum game.
The recent economic upheval (2008 and so forth) did not go hand in hand with a deflation. Inflation ruled troughout all of that. In fact, the encouragement to spend money, money that you might not have, has given rise to a lending/credit industry, which is directly to blame for the worst economic crisis since the great depression. So it's easy to show that economic health is not governed by either deflation or inflation directly.
What inflation does however is encourage people to store their wealth in non inflating assets. And that is where the crux of the story is burried. If you earn just enough to buy food, pay your tax and find shelter, you will not be able to accrue wealth in non inflatable assets simply because you have no wealth left. Even if you are in posession of surplus wealth, storing it in non-inflating assets is not democratized, most vehicles to do it are heavily favoring those with a lot more wealth than just a little wealth.
And that's where bitcoin really comes in, bitcoin is a democratized way to store wealth in a non-inflating asset. There are no principal fees to exchange it and no minimum wealth required to buy into it (unlike stocks, bonds, funds etc.).

It's the adoption curve of a technology whose time has come and we're sitting at the very bottom of the curve. To make it more fun, it's spiked with speculation.
The steepest parts of the curve are yet to come. Bitcoins are nowhere near being a technology with 50% market saturation. Sometimes the speculation will overshoot it, and sometimes it will undershoot it. It's hard to tell which is which at times. It'll correct itself in due time, sometimes dramatically.

I.e. the expected bitcoin reward **per week** is between 0.6 to 1.0 btc.
This gives a profitability period of about 8 months. The network hashrate increase is a very conservative estimate (it could be off by a factor of 2-3 upwards). This could push profitability off to between 14 to 24 months.
I believe that at current bitcoin price, this miner to be overpriced by a factor of about 2-4, i.e. . It should be a good deal when bitcoin reaches prices around $450/btc. Alternatively a fair price for the Mars miner would be around $700 to $1500 tops.

There is a difference to bitcoin. Let's say you have a network path Joe &lt;-&gt; Suzi &lt;-&gt; Bob &lt;-&gt; Allan &lt;-&gt; Zhou Thong &lt;-&gt; Ben Barnake.
**With bitcoin**
Everybody is doing business among themselves but Allan and Ben get zhouthonged. That's fine, they'll learn their mistake.
Joe wants to give bitcoin to Ben and Ben is gonna send some freshly printed dollars to Joe, Zhou Thong isn't involved, the transaction goes flawlessly.
Even though the network contains Zhou Thong, nobodies business is affect except those that directly trusted Zhou Thong.
Lessons learned: don't trust Zhou Thong if you don't want to get zhoutonged.
**With Ripple**
There is really no difference in everybody doing business among themselves and Joe wanting to send to Ben, it's gonna go trough Zhou thong if the businesses only connection is trough him.
Joe wants to receive some USD from Ben and is willing to give him some bitcoin IOUs in exchange. By some mysterious way ripple starts furiously swapping IOUs internally to make it happen, but the IOUs that Zhou Thong claimed for himself are of course never going to show up anywhere.
Joe sent his hard-earned BTC IOUs he bought from a gateway into the network, but they never made it trough to Ben. Ben in response doesn't send Joe any freshly minted USD, Joe is pretty unhappy about that.
Lessons learned: Joe has no idea why he got zhouthonged even though he didn't deal with Zhou Thong, he only knows ripple screwed him over, big time, he got zhourippled.

Well. It's pretty simple really. For a few $ million, which is pocket change for most governments and banks, everybody can buy a substantial share in the currency.
So right now, the cost of "playing the game" is low. In a few years the game can become substantially more expensive to play (in the few $ billions).
From a national policy point of view, it's kind of a nobrainer. Pump a small sum in now, write it down as a cost against future risk, sit back and wait. If it all goes down in flames for some or another reason, the risk didn't bite, and you lost a small sum of money. If the risk (of success) does happen, and you didn't buy now, you're officially screwed.

I feel one should expand on the doomsday scenario and what it means.
To understand how it works, you'll need to look at what happened in situation where there was hyperinflation. What people do is they switch to other stores of wealth. Upon receipt of whatever money, they convert it as fast as possible to anything like alcohol, tabaco, precious metals, long lasting food, manufactured goods beyond their needs and so forth. Even countries that go trough the motions of restricting their citizens ability to store wealth (like Zimbabwe and Argentina), every citizen is making an end-run around this, legal or otherwise, because the government simply can't prosecute every citizen there is.
However, this a very bad thing to happen, because the demand for everyday goods as a store of wealth, makes the inflation so much worse. If say, just the price of gold shot up a lot, you're not terribly worried about your ability to buy pasta tomorrow. But if the value of pasta shoots up like gold would, then you're in trouble because unlike gold, people need food to survive.
So it's not a question of if people would store their wealth in whatever inflation proof asset they can get their hands on, they will. And they will no matter if it's legal or illegal or good or bad for the economy.
The real is question, how would this doomsday scenario come to pass? Well, obviously you'll need inflation. How do you get insane inflation? Well, inflation/deflation, simply put, is an effect of the relation of supply and demand. In a growing economy where most people have solid jobs and sustainable income, supply and demand for goods hold their balance roughly. There's a slight tendency for deflation caused by the economy probing the limits of production that demand can sustain. The government usually negates this trend by printing money and producing artificial inflation. But if things get out of balance, the situation becomes more tricky. If there's less supply than demand, it means that prices for good would rise, i.e. you'll get more inflation. If there's more supply than demand, the prices for good would drop, so you'll get deflation.
Printing money is a oneway street, the only thing it can achieve is to increase inflationary tendencies. You can also increase inflationary tendencies by lowering the interest rate, or conversely increase deflationary tendencies by raising the interest rate.
The current state of affairs is this. If substantial deflation manifests itself, the government can't lower the interest rate any more (because it's already at near zero). So the only thing they could do was to print more money (but remember, unlike interest rate, this is a oneway street, you can't make the money disappear at your convenience). If however, a substantial inflationary tendency manifested itself, a raising of the interest rate is equally not possible for the government, because that would also mean that they'd have to default on their own debt obligations (bonds).
So the last question before the scenario we need to examine is as to why exactly demand and supply might get out of whack.
* Demand might decrease, because people might fall on hard times, and not be able to afford to buy as much. This is deflation.
* Demand might increase, because people have a good job and more income, so they can spend more. This is inflation.
* Supply might decrease, because the ability to provide it might be compromised (can't import enough materials, a dwindling production base, bad economy etc.). This is inflation.
* Supply might increase, because it gets easier to import things, and the economy is doing good. This is deflation.
So as you can see, both inflation and deflation can be caused by a well running economy, or by a bad economy.
A possible scenario for hyperinflation in todays economy looks like this:
* Due to a well running economy and good economic gains (more supply) the government prints a lot of money to keep a steady low inflation. This creates cheap money, and this creates more debt taking.
* The economy hits one or two serious ditches and demand decreases, this creates more deflationary tendency, and so, the government prints more money and lowers the interest rate to zero.
* The serious buyers of the governments debt, decide that due to the weak economy and the suspiciously large looking amount of money they're printing, that they'll phase out their credits to that country. So they convert their long-term bonds (10 year) to short term bonds (1 year), and then let those bonds mature.
* The government which has been promising a tapering of their stimulus related money printing, are now forced to payout large bondholders at maturity, and they're forced to take up demand slack of those who are no longer buying bonds, if they don't want the bonds value to decrease drastically. To do that, they're now printing even more money.
* The country might hit a situation in which the economy makes modest gains, but demand decreases further because of a weak social structure and a weak labour market. This would cause some serious deflation, which can only be combatted by more money printing. So add that to the increased money printing due to debt woes.
* But now government debt reaches astromical heights, and the interest due on that debt exceed the tax income. So the only way to maintain that debt is to print more money, which creates even more debt.
* In due time most creditors who still hold bonds will figure out that this is getting way out of hand, and they simply dump their bonds on the open market, and suddenly a modest deflation turns into an extreme severe inflation, because all the money printed is suddenly awash on the market. And remember, there's now way to take it off the market. But worse's to come.
* To fund government now, the central bank needs to print even more money, because what little money they printed before, is now worth much less, so to run the same size government, they now have to print a lot more.
And that is how you'll get into the hyperinflationary death spiral.

Ripple is untrustworthy. It is so because of three reasons:
* Nobody can create XPRs other than a single entity. Shutdown that entity, the network grinds to a halt.
* The networks implementation is not disclosed. This has serious security and trust implications. Nobody knows if the implementations are actually secure, moreover, nobody knows if the implementation itself is actually sound. Both can bring the network to sudden and painful stop in an instant.
* The network uses the concept of "trust" towards gateways, without expressing how that trust is established in the first place. This leaves the network open to trust based attacks, and it suggests a pyramid of trust with all its inherent problems (compare to the issues DNS/SSL face when another registrar/certificate provider is hacked).

Of course there's huge drawbacks, even if it would work. No thin client is essentially killing it practically. Imagine if every bitcoin user would have to run a full node...
But it's worse, much worse than that. In bitcoin it's actually fairly straightforward to verify the validity of a transaction. All you need to do is to look at the inputs, lookup the blocks where their balance was established, and use that to confirm that the balance of inputs is greater or equal to the outputs. The reason it's simple is that, previous work to verify those inputs validity, has already been established. You don't need to replicate the entire work that went into the longest blockchain of validating the entire transaction history. You just need to validate it up to where somebody else already validated it.
But because in mastercoin you can insert immutable bogus transactions, you would need to verify the entire transaction history for every transaction. You could naively claim, well, it's been valid up to here, so the next one has to be just checked against that "state", but that's a technicality. "The state" is the entire transaction history, and, if you want to emit an acceptable transaction with mastercoin, you've got to perform that huge chunk of work to validate it over, and over and over again, especially with non trivial messages.
But even if you assume, that this mind boggling overhead of validating everything by everyone all the time, and having to keep the entire blockchain around to do it wasn't killing enough, there's a completely new set of problems.
How do you actually decide what is bogus, and what isn't? In bitcoin this is solved by enlighened self-interest. You want to protect your "work" that you just performed, by emitting a valid block and collecting the txfees and block reward. But in mastercoin, there is no such barrier. You can process any transaction, be it valid or based on completely invalid transactions, and there's no penalty whatsoever. There's no work you invested to get there, no reward for validating things, in fact, you can just skip validating, there's no "rejecting" of your claim.
This isn't a system to facilitate transactions and keep accounts. There's no bulletproof guarantee that your funds are safe, what is, and what isn't is a matter of interpretation by everybody. It's a matter of maybes and maybe nots. It's not so much a consensus as it is the blockchain driven equivalent of a messaging board where everybody shouts their opinion and hopes his loudness was sufficient to convince most others.
If bitcoin is a system to keep accounts and perform transactions, not unlike bookkeping in the ledger of a bank by the authorized personel under careful supervision, then mastercoin is the attempt of emulating a bank using 4chan as a messaging medium and have everybody just shout what they think their account is.

That may be so, but it doesn't detract from the main point that it's in everybodies best interest to support bitcoin.
I'd propose that most creators and buyers of speculative altcoins (altcoins that don't add any substantial functionality) have the sole goal of having this altcoin appreciate against bitcoin, in order to cash out to bitcoin. If this statement is true, then in truth, altcoins really support bitcoin.
A way to test this theory is to examine what influences an altcoins valuation, in this example I'll be looking at LTC and BTC.
* LTC/USD 1-year chart: 
* BTC/USD 1-year chart: 
* LTC/BTC 1-year chart: 
The */USD chart shows that there's a strong correlation. It would seem that the LTC/USD valuation closely matches the BTC/USD valuation. Further indication of this is evidenced by the LTC/BTC chart, where patterns of trade are quite obvious that indicate that traders regard LTC/BTC a much stronger trade signal than LTC/USD (see the clear pattern of resistance and supports that chart shows).
In support of the LTC/BTC correlation, a further examination can be made, that is, could another factor such as a correlated hype cycle account for the valuation? I propose that yes it could be, but there are indications that this is only an initiating driver, not the determining trade driver. For this, I ask, what is the magnitude of the price moves by USD, if it was merely correllated hype cycles, you'd expect the valuation to deviate substantially because correllated hype cycles could **not** closely match volume/enthusiasm to a price point.
* In May LTC/USD was around $4/ltc, it's currently around $30/ltc, a ratio of around 7.5
* In May BTC/USD was around $100/btc, it's currently around $800/btc, a ratio of around 8
So the conclusion is clear. Altcoin investors which include creators (predominantely), early adopters and later adopters denominate their altcoin trades in their head by bitcoin, not by fiat. If their main purpose was to cash out to bitcoin in order to cash out to fiat, then clear trade patterns would be visible in the USD denominated trades, but there aren't. Altcoiners trade in relation to BTC because they want to stay in BTC.
This indicates that the speculative altcoins are merely a vehicle to obtain more bitcoins. As such, they don't stand in direct competition to bitcoin, they're more in a dependent relationship in that, they depend on bitcoin to value themselves, but bitcoin does not depend on them.
And that proves the point that it's in everyones best interest to support bitcoin. Because even those with the strongest incentive not to support bitcoin, still entirely support bitcoin.

I don't take objection with the interpretation, but I'd argue this isn't the whole picture.
Discounting speculation and trading, which are a zero-sum game and essentially don't provide a long-term price trend, what drives bitcoins price is adoption.
The adoption in question is following, broadly, a [technology adoption curve]( which has an [S shape]( (starts softly, gets steeper, then levels off).
There's different shapes of S curves, mainly differing in how fast the start and level off. But study of the technology adoption curves reveals that most of them share a common trait. They start slowly, start looking exponential, and then follow the exponential trajectory for a little while, then suddenly become nearly linear and start a long, slow level off to the top. Essentially the uptake curve is much more aprupt and short than the level out curve.
Case in point, the **exponential looking part** of these technologies:
* Radio: 1923 - 1925, 2 years to 5%
* Television: 1947 - 1950, 3 years to 5%
* Color TV: 1957 - 1967, 10 years to 10%
* VCR: 1980 - 1985, 5 years to 10%
* CD Player: 1984 - 1987, 3 years to 2%
* cellphone: 1985 - 1994, 9 years to 12%
Pretty much any technology of the modern age has an adoption curve following an exponential growth during the first 3-10 (mean 6.5 years) reaching anything between 5-10% (mean 7.5%) of market saturation.
Bitcoin was introduced in 2009. It's now 5 years old, which means in another 1.5 years (mid 2015) there's a fair (better than 50%) chance it has reached anything between 5-10% market saturation and will leave its exponential part of the adoption curve.
So purely for that reason, OPs price prediction might run smack into the linear part of the technology adoption S shaped curve long before the exponential growth part would indicate a $10k/btc price somewhen in 2016 or beyond.
What does this mean if you're so inclined to speculate on the price? It means that until say 2015 we continue to see insane gains of the 1000% anually and beyond variety, and accompanying volatility. But then in 2016, the gains will suddenly level off to say 100% in 2016, then 50% in 2017, 25% in 2018 and so forth. On the plus side, the insane volatility will abate, so the price will be more stable.

Credit/debt isn't the root of all evil. But it's a good portion of the evil. Taken together with too big to fail creditors, constant inflation and zero interest rates it creates the phenomenon of cheap money. Cheap money discourages saving and encourages taking on more debt than you can pay in the present, hoping for inflation and rising wages to fix it. It goes sour when people use the debt to buy into bubbles and their wages stagnate due to an economic slump, and the too big to fail creditors start sitting on a pile of debt that will all default at the same time.

Sure, but bitcoin isn't either an index, nor a stock, nor a currency, nor a company. It's something new.
So let me explain it quite like to a 3-year old.
Money has not been improved upon in more than 40 years. The last money invention (credit cards) date to 1972 from before there was internet. Banks, exchanges and credit card processors are sitting there between us and what we want to pay for and if you look at the whole chain you'll find that you are often paying around 10% in fees. This industry is more than ripe for massive disruption. They're charging ridiculous fees because they haven't invented anything new in more than 40 years, and they're operating under the assumption that there won't be anything, ever. Well, they're wrong.
So, now why would bitcoin be this "new" thing? Why not something else? A couple reasons why:
* The only way to do a truly decentralized free floating and trustworthy digital currency is by doing it exactly like bitoin.
* Asking governments to do a truly decentralized digital currency would be like asking them to give up central banking and invent facebook. That doesn't happen on fiat. Governments can't do that, even if they wanted to. Governments are addicted to central banking and the ability to print money on a whim and set interest rates.
* A government backed digital currency would have to be pegged to their currency, and the government would have to be the only ones in power to make new coins with the push of a button. And it's fairly certain that while they're at it, they'd also build in the ability to take your coins away with the push of a button. That's not a trustworthy currency, that's just more of the same.
* A private company could come up with a truly decentralized digital currency and promote it. But they would have to start at zero, just like bitcoin, and work their way up. That's not interesting to any company. Amazon for instance doesn't want to have to wait years until prices and circulation are high enough so that it can represent a reasonable amount of their daily business.
* A private company would have to peg their cryptocurrency against an existing currency (like the USD). And this won't work because at that point Amazon would have become a central bank, printing money. Governments won't let amazon do that. And amazon couldn't start with a peg and then go to free floating because it'd immediately experience wild swings they can't back anymore.
So the genius of bitcoin is that it's doing something, which nobody else can emulate, neither private companies nor central banks. It can only do what it does, and be 40 years ahead of everybody else because it is the way it is.
That means that there are only really two outcomes: bitcoin fails and there will not be anything like it ever. Or bitcoin succeeds.
Do you truly believe that money is going to stay the same in face of a radically changed world forever? Do you truly believe that the state of the art is an ingrown industry that hasn't invented a single thing in 40 years?
For this reason I am extremely bullish on bitcoin in the long term, 10 years and beyond. I'm keenly aware that this is possibly going to go trough many booms and busts until it gets there. But I am convinced that it gets there eventually, because it's an idea whose time has come. And nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come.

That's not an option the Fed has. It's an option that the US government has, which is different, and it's an important distinction.
Most of the profitable resources are already hogged by western nations, or nuclear powers, it looks bad if you attack them. You could go and attack some backward-yokel country, but they don't have the juiciest resources to begin with, and before that starts making a return on investment it's a long time.
So, you need to fund this war, in some way. Unfortunately, that means printing more money, and I've pointed out how that doesn't work to keep the USD from inflating.
So it's not really an option, it's not even really a way to kick the can down the road.

20% by now. The problem will correct itself in due time (I mean the inter exchange spread, not mtgoxes withdrawal issues).
There are two mechanisms that drive the price up:
* Because you can't get fiat out, and if you have fiat on gox, you're going to buy bitcoin and withdraw those.
* Because you can't get fiat out, people are not performing arbitrage on gox against other exchanges.
The way this will correct itself is this:
* If you know you can't get fiat out, and if you're paying a 20% premium, you're not gonna send your money to gox anymore to buy bitcoins, you're going to send it to whatever other exchange has a better price.
Eventually the lack of supply of bitcoins on gox (people willing to sell) will be met by an equal lack of demand (people have migrated elsewhere). And gox will go quietly into the night.

We already had a crash in bitcoin, and it came back out stronger. We will perhaps have another crash, and it will come out stronger again.
The finance industries last invention is more than 40-years back, it predates the internet. It's a market ripe for the taking. Nearly every company that went trough the dotcom "crash" and didn't get wiped out (Ebay, Amazon, etc.), their stock is now valued higher than at the height of the dotcom bubble. The Dotcom bubble wasn't just bubble, it was also what made the world. Bitcoins fluctuating valuations aren't a crash or a catastrophy. They're growing pains. Growth is always painful, and big things grow more painful than anything else.

The theory that inflation helps pay off debts is based on the idea that the size of debt relative to what you will make in the future gets reduced.
This theory has some gaping holes in it.
Since 2000 household income (not adjusted for inflation) has risen:
* Top 5% by ~27%
* Middle class by ~20%
* Low income class by ~10%
However if you adjust for inflation the picture is quite different:
* Top 5%  **-6.1%**
* Middle class **-12.2%**
* Low Income **-19.5%**
This wasn't always the case, up until the year 2000 inflation adjusted wages rose.
This simply means that for workers of all income classes, income did not rise above inflation.
So if your theory is that a rising income level will make it easier to pay off debt you accrued, that's pretty much bunk. Income levels do not keep up with inflation since 2000. If you now step on the inflation gas pedal, it won't change much about the debt, but it will hit workers of all classes pretty hard.
So if you're One of the 50% of households (half of america) who're about 15% poorer today than 13 years ago, simply by not getting raises to match inflation, how do you like the idea of getting say, 25% poorer in 5 years? Sounds great doesn't it?

A recap on why it matters.
The US economy has a meagre 2% GDP growth projected for 2013 and an unemployment rate of anything between 7.2% (official) to anything between 20-30% (if you don't do funny accounting and try to get a realistic number). Labor participation rate is at an all-time low of 63%.
Back in 1995/6 (the last shutdown that lasted 3 weeks) the GDP growth was 5%, unemployment rate was 4% (official) and maybe 10-15% realistically and labor participation rate was 67%.
This illustrates that the economy is on a much weaker footing now in 2013 than back in 1995.
It is expected that every week of shutdown shaves anything between 0.5-1% off the yearly GDP growth. So a lengthy shutdown has the potential to push the GDP change into negative territory, which is pretty much the beginning of the next recession.
Back in 1995 the government was concerned about about the economy overheating, and to counteract they could raise the interest rate a little, which probably helped to cushion the blow of a govt. shutdown to the economy (because they could later lower interest rates to heat things up a little more).
Now in 2013 the interest rate is already effectively at 0% and the economy shows no sign of substantially recovering, so raising the interest rate is out the question. Even if they could do it, which they can't because a raised interest rate would also mean that the US had to pay more interest on their debt (eventually), which they can ill afford anyway.
Another way to stimulate the economy would be incentivizing programs, but they can't do those programs now (because shutdown).
And because things aren't exciting enough already, the US treasury is going to bump into their debt ceiling anywhere between October 17th and 21st. It is projected that by October 17th the treasury will not be able to borrow any more money, and they'll have to pay with what they have which is roughly $30 billion in cash and about $4 billion in tax revenue/day. They'll need about $8 billion/day for expenses and a couple billion/day for interest payments on debt. Which means that it takes anywhere between one to a couple of weeks that they run out of money completely, and will have to default on some payments and/or debt.
This is all a substantial uncertainty for the economy. It might have a large impact which will hit trough to currencies overall (remember that a countries currency exchange rate vs. other countries, among other things, includes a judgment about that countries economic health).
A US default (though somewhat unlikely) would send the US dollar plunging down against other currencies, and it is likely bitcoin would rise in response vs. the USD.
The effect of this uncertainty is already starting to affect the currency markets. For instance the USD/CHF exchange rate broke trough a nearly 24 month high (or low if you consider CHF/USD) in the last 24 hours with a 1% change. A 3-week shutdown could see as much as 10-25% change in the exchange rate.

Initially this will do 35 bitcoins per day. However depending on difficulty this can quickly drop off, and it is possible that the hardware will not return the 4600btc it cost to get it ever.

* They have not demonstrated that they actually have product, not even a prototype. Their only demonstration was short, and not an ASICS miner, and cannot be taken for a demonstration of what they intend to deliver.
* After not showing any demonstration, they have begun taking preorders.
* There has been no news since their non-demonstration
* They are "upgrading" their "offer" and downgrading their price (happened already twice), so it's quite possible that early buyers get a much worse offer than later on.
It all looks suspiciously at least like a Butterflylabs repeat performance, perhaps even an Avalon repeat performance.

You're confusing something demonstratably. I proposed a simple statement:


And you're continuing to refute this argument by the fact that altcoins exist. However this line of reasoning can't be used to make any kind of prediction you could verify against observation. There is no further truth you can derive from that line of reasoning other than "I say it is so".
I proposed the simple statement, because it can be tested. You can predict that if it is true, that bitcoin would be most supported. This can be tested by asking which places that accept any cryptocurrency, are accepting which ones.
* Do they accept bitcoin? Yes without exception.
* Do they accept only bitcoin? Mostly yes.
* Do they accept an altcoin? Sometimes, rarely.
If your counter argument was true, then this would not be the case. Which implies that my argument is correct, that for this point in time, it is in everybodies best interest to support bitcoin.

It is currently a bad time for mining equipment. It's not always a bad time, but it's a bit hard to predict.
A good time is when difficulty isn't spiking like mad, price is stable and mining gear producers offer products that're competititvely priced to produce an ROI in a forseeable timeframe. Oh, and you'll need to predict this magical trinitry about 6 months in advance.

Yeah but you can't buy an Avalon because they're out of stock. They also only offer up the big boys, and sorry, but before I throw thousands of dollars at a hardware company, I'm happy to evaluate smaller units. And ASICminer isn't even selling anything. So BFL is the only actually selling anything at this point, it's not like there's a choice.

The first reason is that there are fees:
MtGox charges a 0.6% fee and BitFloor charges a 0.4% fee. That means you will have 1% fees on an arbitrage transaction. So for instance at $140 there has to be a $1.4 difference to see any profit.
The second reason is spread. When prices are calm the spread is small, but when they are hectic, the spread widens. For instance Bitfloor has a $2 spread at the moment and MtGox spread is similar. Since you are selling into the bids and buying into the asks, you need to add the spreads, so for instance $4 difference.
The third reason is slippage. While your trades are executed you might be reacting to outdated signals or your order might not get filled and you have to retry, by which time prices could have moved against you. You can quantify that as a risk of the trade, let's say every trade you make has a 5% chance of becoming unprofitable due to slippage. That means you need extra percentage to make the trade work, 5% to be exact. At $140 that would be $7.
Taken the fees, spread and risk together you will need to have a difference of $12.4 just to make a zero sum trade. However you will also want to make a profit so let's say you're looking for a 30% delta, so factor in say $4 for profit. So you get a $16.4 difference to make the arbitrage work and make a profit.

Well, it'll settle eventually. And deflation isn't stopping spending, in fact, for 2013 bitcoin has a nominal inflation rate of 12%. It is postponing spending, until either prices stabilize somewhere, or it comes down, or it reaches each owns personal point where spending resumes because it represents a small percentage of your coins.

The problem is this: Clowns like this clown have been proposing cryptocurrencies just like bitmint since ages. By far and large, they where not a success. Why not? Because they introduce counterparty risk, central control and failure and because they're always awesomly complex.
Bitcoin is not complex. It is simple. It has no counterparty risk, and it has no central control and failure.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:18:31
It's less than you started out with, until it becomes more, I've already explained that.
If you buy a miner that does in its total **lifetime 5btc**:
* If you **paid 10btc** (or the equivalent in dollars converted to btc) then you made a **5btc loss**
* If you **paid 5btc** (or the equivalent in dollars converted to btc) then you are **break even**
* If you **paid 2btc** (or the equivalent in dollars converted to btc) then you made a profit of **3btc**
Every investment you do, that has alternatives (like simply buying the btc) you have to measure against that. If chances do not favor a profit, then it's a bad investment.
The means to retain wealth is making more good investments than bad ones (assuming about equal payout of each). Which means that at the very least, an investment has to have a better than 50% chance to be good. Buying mining hardware that has a 0% chance of recovering the BTCs you put in to get it, is 100% guaranteed to be a bad investment.

Peak oil doesn't mean that there's no more oil. It means it has become uneconomic to pull it out. For a while fuel prices will adjust up to make the more uneconomic variants of fuel foraging feasible, but eventually the fuel will simply be too expensive and demand completely collapses, quickly followed by any foraging activities that aren't sustainable. So peak oil is very real.
Lithium may be plentyful, but getting it from seawater isn't economic, and demand for it has been surging due to the fuel crisis, see peak oil.
Peak copper is also very real. The western infrastructure is built on copper. Emerging economies will not be able to use that amount of copper as the west did because the demand of copper to equip India alone would outstrip the supply of easily reachable copper. It's true that there are alternatives in some cases. But in the end it's simply a cost increase, further depressing the economy.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:58:34
I don't think you understood all of the points.


Yes, but if you'd like to add features to bitcoin, without starting an altcoin, you'll inject a "new" genesis block, and fork the software, writing miners which use the blockchain going forward from that injected new genesis. So everybody who has bitcoin in the blockchain before, still has em in both blockchains after, substantial difference is, one is the govcoin, and the other is the whatever, freecoin.


Again, one retailer outperforming another isn't what I meant. One country outperforming another is more likely, but a counter-blocking scheme really means something different. Amazon might find itself unable to process their bitcoin transactions because miners reject them. Blacklists cut both ways, be careful what geenie you let out of the bottle.


Well, what is one Govt. beloved regulation to uphold, is another Govt. market advantage. Since the US already ceeded any economic and exchange relevance, China is, I'm pretty sure, going to enthusiastically not implement any suggested regulation...

It does not matter if dealing in bitcoin violates some law. It matters to the operators of US-based exchanges, certainly. But it does not matter to bitcoin.
The reason being that bitcoin gives you no central point of attack. And short of shutting down bitcoin, which is impossible, nobody can prevent anybody from dealing with bitcoin anywhere in the world. And altough bitcoin is not anonymous, things like ZeroCoin and mixer services easily make it so.
So making a law (in the past or future) that forces bitcoin underground would achieve exactly the polar opposite of what the law intends.

It's not the motivation, but it matters to bitcoin because everything is macro. As nations fail and currencies get devalued, solid stores of wealth like metals will be eyed by many. However the government can always come in and take your gold away, and what then? That is where bitcoin comes in. Oh they might try regulating and taking your bitcoins away, but that's easier said than done as compared to gold.

* Merchant btc VAT: 25% VAT on converting bitcoin at exchange, add $500 to sticker price
* Exchange btc to $ VAT: 25% VAT on the conversion, added to conversion, $500 gone, merchant adds it to sticker price.
* Sticker price now: $3000

As we speak bitcoins network is growing, with investments being done in:
* Exchanges popping up left and right
* Merchant integrations
* Payment gateways
* Financial services
* Financial instruments (like ETFs and watnot)
* Mining equipment (that secures the network and makes it tick)
* Novel applications (such as deeds, colored-coins and so forth)
* Alternative wallet implementations with their own innovations
All this investment isn't going away because an alternative coin is better at something. Better at something isn't enough. If an altcoin comes up with some substantial invention beyond simply tweaking the parameters, it's likely bitcoin will adopt this feature.
You can see this network effect at work rather directly. Although there are numerous parties that engage in altcoins, **none** of these places reject bitcoin. The network effect forces any place that deals with altcoins to also deal with bitcoins, they can ignore bitcoin, but that'd cut their business down to a fraction of what they're currently getting.
And as time goes on, this incentive will become only stronger, not weaker. The only possible way for that incentive to cease would be if somebody comes up with an altcoin that's as much better than bitcoin, than bitcoin is better than paypal. That'd be fantastic, but very unlikely. It's not often that somebody comes up with a combination of groundbreaking ideas and bakes them into a single piece of usable software and gains substantial adoption. I think this is a once in a lifetime event, if even that.

$0 is impossible, for a couple of reasons, and I would wish people would stop promulgating this ridiculous assessment.
1) You can't complete a trade at $0. It doesn't make sense to do that. People won't be selling coins at $0. Maybe close to $0 but not $0.
2) As the price falls, the purchasing power of people wishing to buy magnifies, while selling power of people selling wanes. It's hard to put a finger on it where the sweet spot is, but there will be a price below which it will be very, very hard to go for any length of time. Personally I think that's around $25 for the next 1-2 years or so. It was $5 for the last 2 years. Due to increased market participation, the purchasing power (in $) has gone up about 500%. However the selling power has only gone up some 12% (more coins).

In mining the exchange price doesn't matter directly. You are looking at a chance to recover the bitcoins you spent in getting the hardware plus then some.
If you don't have the bitcoins, pretend for the calculation that you bought them the day you buy the hardware and spent them on the hardware.
Some people think that a fair price for a 60gh miner is about 170btc (or about $30'000). While that may be true, there is a risk. The hardware might not make back the 170btc you spent. You might still get out more than $30'000 due to bitcoin price appreciation, but you lost coins.
Avalon Asics is calculating their price against the 2x the difficulty over 3 months to make the investment back, which at the last round came out at about 70btc.
BFL is stating their prices in USD, but is rising them every 1-2 months by 100% while they halve the performance.
At the current crazyness I would recommend the following calculation: The hardware has to be able to recover the btc you spent in 3 months assuming 10x current difficult.
There are nearly no offers that would perform on that level at the moment. However if the btc exchange rate appreciates it gets more attractive in favor of BFLs offer, and less attractive for Avalon Asics offer (the longer they are not downgrading their price).

The Kardashev scale measures one thing, and one thing only, and that is energy. It is a good scale because we can be reasonably sure that regardless of the life in question, the rules of physics won't be radically different somewhere else in the universe at the current evolutionary stage of the universe.

1) Investing $0. Yeah, I don't think the word means what you think it means (maybe you meant taking a position?)
2) There are fairly good ways to deal with the issue of volatility. You'll want to avoid buying at the top, or selling at the bottom. I understand, everybody would like to avoid that. Fortunately, there's an answer to this, which is called dollar cost averaging. You give up a chance at spectacularly bad buys and sells, and you give up a chance at spectacularly good buys and sells. In times of extreme volatility, it's quite a good answer.

The school I'm following is called the quantity theory of money. So, sure, I'm not denying that the valuation of bitcoin is rising, mostly, adoption rate and other factors.
The experienced inflation or deflation in the quantity theory of money, is the balance between issuance and economic development.
However, this measure is with fiat currencies often distorted, because of things like fractional reserve banking, government debt taking, interest rate setting, enforced use of the currency, taxes and so forth. So, rather than infer it from the balance of growth versus issuance, it's measured against a basked of selected goods.
So what I'm pointing out that bitcoins issuance with 12% in 2013 is far outpacing most established currencies prior to 2008 and 2011. However, bitcoin is also starting its growth curve. And there wouldn't be any kind of number that somebody could pick 4 years in advance, that would somehow magically match up the economic growth at the time.
Anyhow, the opponents of the quantity theory of money always like to point how fiat currencies valuation, isn't determined by issuance evidently (as measured by the fact that the issuance shot up by to 100%/year in all major currencies, yet most countries don't experience hyperinflation), so, they say, the quantity theory of money must be wrong. At the same time, those same people, then turn around and point their fingers at bitcoin or precious metals and say, "oh it's deflationary, because supply is limited", and happily apply the quantity theory of money to something they don't like.
So how do you resolve this apparent paradox? The resolution, is relatively straightforward, and from what I hear also accepted by serious economists. The quantity theory of money, maybe be suspended by other measures for a while. But over the long term, when those measures have run their course, it emerges back to the fore in determining how much purchasing power the money has.

I've got an idea right there.
So ultimately a blacklist scheme would have to go to miners, making them refuse transactions.
You don't know if they use a blacklist, and if they do, which coins are on it. And the proponents of the blacklist will do their best to keep you from finding out.
However this gives you an opportunity to sniff out foul apples. If you look at which blocks the miner mines, and the transactions broadcast, you can infer which transactions where blocked. Not from a single sample, but over time, you'll see it.
Once you know which transactions have been refused, you know which coins they where. So you arrange to get some of these coins to use as a probing device.
Next you write a special client, one that doesn't "broadcast" transactions, but only sends them to specifically targted nodes. And this probe will reveal in time which node is using the same blacklist.
So now you have a list of foul apples in hand, so the next thing you do is rather simple.
The first thing you can do is you can infer the whitelist these nodes have, by looking at which coin sources these nodes preferably service. You won't know at first, but, over time you'll see clear patterns.
Now you have a whitelist and a blacklist they use in hand. At first they'll not be very accurate, but overtime the confidence of that will grow to very precise measures. Now you can act.
Nodes which are detected to behave malovent towards the network are blocked. Their blocks are rejected and transactions they broadcast are ignored. Transactions for coins on the whitelist are ignored.
And so, the great forkwar begins.

Well, the bretton wood system lasted only so long as the US was on the gold standard, and was quickly abandoned thereafter.
Precious metal based currencies where in use in the US since the founding. At some occasions the US switched to printed currencies, such as:
* 1690 colonial bills, used by the original colonies to fund military expenses, was printed to worthlessness, people fell back to precious metals.
* 1775 continental bills, was printed to worthlessness, fallback to precious metals
* 1864 confederate dollar, printed to worthlessness, fallback to precious metals
* 1863 US Dollar rev 1.0
* 1900 US Dollar rev 2.0 with gold standard
* 1971 US Dollar rev 3.0 off gold standard
* 2011-2013 More US dollars printed than in the entire history of the US dollar since revision 1.0 prior to 2011
* &lt;fill in blank here&gt;
So in actuality the 1971 US dollar which is enjoying the very young age of only 43 years is the first US paper currency backed by jack shit that hasn't collapsed, yet.
It's fairly obvious that the US yo-yos between precious metal based currencies and worthless paper about every 40 years. Next cycle is due, soon.

The cost of mining is the amount of bitcoin you laid out to get the hardware plus the electricity cost in bitcoin. The benefit of mining is block reward and transaction fees.
A large chunk of the cost is the hardware outlay. And because that is a fixed cost up front, you need to estimate if it is going to be profitable for you. In order to estimate that, you'll need to estimate the increase in network hashrate.
The hashrate is currently in an exponential growth curve, and most miners did not expect that (although some surely did).
Since ALL mining hardware is either delivered ridiculously late (BFL, Avalon etc.), doesn't perform to spec vastly under promise (KNC) or is priced such that it's impossible to turn a profit (Asicminer and everybody else), mining for people who don't produce their own chips is currently... a very sad affair.
The essential issue is the dynamics of what mining has become, which is somewhat worrysome. A party producing feasible mining hardware, for which their "customer" (aka dupes) already paid, is highly motivated to not ship that hardware until it has become useless, because they'll just plug it in and have it mine for them. Additionally they'll not release the hardware too fast, even once it has become essentially useless, because that would compete with hardware that is still useful for them.
So the "mining industry" is at the core very profitable for those who produce the hardware, because they get their hardware subsidized for free from their "customers", and only carry the cost of electricity, which is the smaller of the two pieces of mining profitability calculations.

Man that's not consumer friendly, they need to fix this ASAP or electricity is doomed.
* Cars: Geeze, where do I even begin. You know how it's convenient to just put your horse in front of a lorry or sit on it and you're ready to go? Well cars aren't like that. You need to fill in gas (where do you even get some?!) and oil and water. Then you need to crank the thing which has a fair chance of breaking your arm (I kid you not), and maybe, maybe it'll start. And you're good to go right? Well nope, that thing uses up its oil and gas and whatshit not after just a few miles you need to stop and find some more. Complete clusterfuck, they need to fix that ASAP or cars are doomed.
* Computers: I never understood what's wrong with an abacus, but let's pretend I want to calculate bigger numbers and more of them (I don't, but meh). So you need to power the thing with electricity (a-ha-ha, what a clusterfuck that was). But wait, it doesn't stop there, you also need to program your computer to do a task by sticking wires around in the back, like a zillion of them. I mean, the time I spend plugging wires around, I'd have easily consulted my logarithm books and abacus and done the darn calculation myself easily. That stuff is completely consumer unfriendly, they need to fix this ASAP, or computers aren't going anywhere, FUCKING EVER!

A DDOS is where a distributed cloud of attackers is causing a victim to DOS. A DOS is defined as a denial of service, which denies other users the service.
A HFT who is using his serverfarm to hammer an exchange with spam orders is performing a (D)DOS on the trading engine of an exchange.
A TCP/IP DDOS to the front facing webserver is not a very attractive target, because it requires far more attackers.
Attacking the trading engine is a more attractive target because handling orders is the weak point of an exchange, which cannot easily be scaled.
If an exchange is not protecting its trade engine from a (D)DOS (by whatever measure, fees, bans, etc.) then it's a bad exchange.

You'll need to explore 2^256 combinations (1.15x10^77). If you had say 1.5ph/s (the current network speed, that's 1.5x10^15 hashes per second) and if you assumed that an eliptic curve hash takes the same amount of time as an sha256 hash (it doesn't, it takes substantially longer), then it takes you about 1.5x10^46 seconds as a lower bound, or about 7.4x10^38 years.
That's 74000000000000000000000000000000000000 years.

Anything being centralized is a big problem. If any part (of any cryptocurrency) is in the hands of a central party it makes it attackable.
Bitcoins weakness is the current landscape of exchanges. But this can (and does) change. Ripples weakness is that it does rely on a central control, which can be attacked, and then ripple is toast. Ripple may be better than Mt.Gox (what isn't?). But it's far worse than Bitcoin (the whole network is not free of a central point of failure).
To drive that point home, if Mt.Gox is attacked, sure, it's bad for the price, but bitcoin doesn't grind to a halt. But if the central ripple authority is attacked, ripple as a whole grinds to a halt...
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:12:30
The solution is you look for another platform. Sure it'd be nice if MtGox would work well, but it doesn't. And if moaning about it would fix it, MtGox would be the best bitcoin exchange on the world by a large margin.

That's not true. You cannot measure the expense and recovery of mining hardware in $. You have to measure it in bitcoin. If, at a given time, you pay say 70btc for a miner, then you need to make damn sure that this miner has a reasonable chance to return those 70btc to you. There are plenty of stories of people who've paid for mining hardware an amount equivalent of bitcoin that the mining hardware never recovered. Even from experienced miners. Mining profitability is a risky calculation, and the risk can bite you in the arse.

* Trader posts his shorting analysis @ ~$80/btc
* Price shoots up near to $136/btc, likely stopping him out
* Trader rewrites his post calling everybody assholes
Traders notable notable insights with 20/20 hindsight:


**A note on strategy I'd like to add**
Shorting has limited profit and unlimited risk.  it can only go down to $0/btc. But (as the last 2 weeks have shown) it can go up to $266/btc. This represents an asymetry that makes shorting bitcoin difficult for any timespan.
Going long on bitcoin has limited risk and unlimited profit. However going long on bitcoin on a small timespan is considerably risky as the price is very volatile and you will need to buy-in all at once. Going long over a large timespan allows you to dollar-cost average (buy in in small fixed $ chunks periodically), considerably reducing your risk.
Charting as a means to discover sentiment is popular, but doesn't have a terribly good track record of being a good indicator.

While it's true that physical gold has no counterparty risk, it's not the entirety of the story.
A major use of gold is in interbank settlement. Banks rely on swapping paper-gold to settle their debts. This creates vast depositories of vaulted gold to be held to back up that paper gold.
If for some reason paper-gold loses its value to banks as a settlement mechanism, be it because it's too volatile, or because of backwardation or because some major paper-gold fraud gets uncovered, the depositories are suddenly sitting on vast vaults filled with physical gold, for which nobody wants to accept a paper-receipt because they've stopped trusting the paper-receipt.
So what will naturally happen is that the gold will be physically sold. Paradoxically this means that a crash in paper-gold drags physical gold down...

This whole not backed therefore worthless idea is really misguided.
Bitcoin is the way it is because that is the only feasible way to do it.
* it needs to be decentralized because it would be impossible t to devise an authority that the whole world can trust.
* and that means that there can be no central anything about it like a central control on the rate of issuance.
* so the issuance has to be algorithmic
* and that means there is no right choice of issuance, just less and more workable choices
* it has to be a store of value in order to make it attractive and to stabilize it's value.
* the issuance cannot be percent inflationary because then it could not act as a store of value and people would not be interested in holding it, so it could not spread.
* the issuance at a fixed rate would be no different than deflationary.
* the issuance cannot be all in one hand from the start, that would be centralized.
* proof of work is needed to make transactions safe.
* this means there has to be mining
* mining needs to be decentralized
* so mining needs to be encouraged by a reward.
* at the beginning the txfees will not suffice so block reward is provided.
* block reward needs to be the mechanism of issuance
* and so on
If you really think it trough, there is no other way. It may insult economists and their nice theories, but bitcoin has to work practically. To do that it needs to work exactly like it does.

Technical analysis, while interesting, does have a zero track record of being able to predict market movement any better than tossing a coin.
Most of the very short lived successes (perceived or otherwise) of technical analysis are down a couple phenomena:
* [Confirmation bias]( wishful thinking: A phenomenon where information confirming your beliefs are rated higher than information invalidating it.
* [Survivorship bias]( A phenomenon where conclusions (such as success) are drawn from a population where there are "survivors" which are naturally more visible than the ones that didn't survive.
* [Clustering illusion]( Where a random occurence of events seems to have significant streaks that defy chance.
* [Self-serving bias]( peoples tendency to overemphasize their successes and play down their failures.
* [Bandwagon effect]( Where a common belief is formed because some people believe it.
* [Herd behavior]( where people choose to behave in a certain fashion without coordination (such as using a particular strategy)
Not all of the phenomena are self-centered, some are social, and might work in some limited fashion. However the nature of markets (being a zero-sum game that has clear winners and loosers) makes the prevalence of shared strategies impossible for two reasons:
* If everybody is using the same strategy, the market wouldn't move, as this would allow for no looser or winner. The very fact that markets do move shows that not everybody uses the same strategy.
* If a strategy (A) is prevalent, then a contrarian strategy (B) to it will yield extraordinary benefits for a short while and put believers of strategy A into the loosing camp. Strategy B will quickly gain popularity, giving rise to strategy C, ad nauseum.
Chartists who try to come up with new ways to perform successful technical analysis in particular fall into a trap where they run their strategies on historical data, and tweak the strategy until it is successful. The strategy then immediately fails to return any benefit when confronted with entirely new data. [This is known as curve fitting](

It doesn't matter, 1.2gh in GPU and rig costs you more more than 4x as much, so instead of talking about 2.5btc for the rig, we're talking about 10btc for the rig. So even assuming todays difficulty and 0.08btc/24h you will need 125 days to recover your cost. Of course if you started with 1.2gh like a year ago it's profitable (though you have spend about 120btc to get the rig, did you recover that by now?). But if you had to expend BTCs today to get your 1.2gh rig things wouldn't look as rosy.
Btw. **if** BFL ships the 4.5gh machines from the last batch that they sold for $140 (which I expended 1.8btc to get), that actually offers a reasonable chance **if** it arrives in the next 6 months to recover my 1.8btc. But I'm not sure about that.

I'm not optimistic about the continued existence of our monetary system in its current form, and that's before taking into account derivatives.
The growth in any quantity can be classified in either of these 4 types: Linear, Logistic, Logarithmic or Exponential.
In nature (that humans evolved in, and understand intuitively) you will only find 3 of these curves: Linear, Logistic and Logarithmic.
The latter curve, the exponential growth curve doesn't happen in nature because due to limited resources, it always reverts to a Logistic curve.
Unfortunately our debt-based monetary system at it's basis working of interest is neither Linear, Logistic or Logarithmic, it's Exponential.
Exponential curves are difficult to keep control of because you might not know the full parameters of the equation (what base and power it is). It's nearly impossible to distinguish in noisy data the kind of curve at the beginning. You might think you're on a simple power of two exponential. But if your estimation was wrong, you will think that even of an exponential of the power of 16 or more up until the very last moment, when it suddenly, and abruptly changes into a hockey stick shape.
These things in our monetary system are **definitely** exponentials of unknown configuration: The monetary base and the debt.
I'm not really optimistic about that, not at all.

Here's a couple things that bitcoin can do, that ripple cannot:
* Perform transactions without trust (either direct or implied)
* Send a large sum trough and be assured of fulfillment (IOUs scarcity, no trustworthy path, IOU defaults, what have you)
Which means that: You can use ripple to send small and inconsequential sums (like game microtransactions, or facebook credits, or whatever). But you cannot use it to run your business, pay your employees, maintain your pension fund, and so forth.
The relationship between Ripple and Bitcoin is a bit like the difference between paypal and your bank. You can use paypal for smaller inconsequential things. But if you're gonna keep your lifesavings on paypal or depend on it to pay your employees, you're gonna have a bad time.

The "social network of payment" idea might be cute, but I just don't see it working.
It's not working for Ripple either. The way people use Ripple is by going to one or two centralized exchanges and put their money in or get it out.
The way Ripple is **supposed** to work is by not having centralized exchanges. But that means that everybody in the network takes counterparty risk for everybody in the chain of trust. You can't practically use this to to conduct business because the payment making it from A -&gt; B in actual physicality might be impossible, flawed, exploited, defaulted, blocked or take a long time.
As a relatively simple rule of thumb, a system that can't sustain conducting business with it, can't be practically used to solve the problem of a system you can't currently do business with.

No it doesn't, but market manipulation is always ongoing. Not just in bitcoin. But ultimately market manipulation can't make people truly believe a value to be fair. It can neither elevate sentiment to levels it can't sustain, nor can it depress it permanently. It can achieve these things in the short term, for a few days, weeks, maybe months, but not indefinitely.

The adoption curve is what bitcoin can be. If it is for businesses to accept as payment, then how many businesses have adopted it? If it is for financial services to speculate with, then how many are offering it to trade? If it is to be used as a settlement currency, then how many settlements are made in it? If it is to be used to pay your bills and pay salaries, how many are getting paid in bitcoin? If it is to be a mobile payment system, how many users and bussinesses are using it for mobile payment yet?
The answer to all these questions is: Except for the few and the brave, almost nobody is using bitcoin for anything yet. This is the very frontier, the very bottom of the adoption curve. This will play out in decades to come if bitcoin is successful.

The last big bubble pop saw a downside off the top to less than 10% of the top value. That was down from $32/btc to $2/btc (very briefly) and hovering around $3-$5 for a while.
Applying this to the current bubble means there could be a low of $16/btc and an extended period where it hovers around $24/btc to $41/btc.
How applicable that train of thought is remains to be seen. Many argue this bubble is different than the other big bubble. On the other hand, they are also remarkably similar.

Mining is a very specialized activity. If you do it on general purpose computers it is expensive. A good yardstick is that a 7990 GPU gives you about 1gh/s of mining power while it is using most of its 3tflops of computing power to do it. The network currently performs 80th/s, which means it has got about 240pflop/s in computing power measured by general purpose computers. If it was a supercomputer, it would be the  supercomputer on earth, outclassing the fastest supercomputer (Titan, 17pflop/s) by a factor of more than 14x.
Recently a 1pflop supercomputer anno 2009 got decomissioned as being too expensive to operate, so it's fair to assume supercomputers have a shelf life of about 5 years. The Titan supercomputer cost the tax payer $100million to build. It's fair to assume it costs around $30million annually in electricity, rent and so on. So the cost of running it per is around $136'000/day.
If the government used Titan to mine, they would be able to capture about 1/14th of every coin mined, so that's about 257 coins/day. A coin goes currently for about $100/coin so it's about $25'000/day.
The total daily profit of mining with Titan would be $25'000 - $136'000 = **$-111'000/day**
It is quite likely that nobody who paid $100million for a gadget that can only capture 1/14th of the daily bitcoins is going to mine with it :)

He links three charts, which aren't in any way relevant.
* The first chart is the count of transactions per market capitalization (i.e. price). First of all, those don't belong divided one by the other, but even if you assume they do, the size of the transaction would matter as well. Somebody could just issue a million satoshi sized transaction and that chart would look fabulous, what kind of bullshit metric should that be?
* The second chart is more promising, it's the estimated transaction volume divided by the market capitalization (i.e. price). He's careful to point out in USD denominated, but for this chart, that actually matters jack squat, because if you divide by the USD price of the day, by the USD the volume of the day, what you're left with is simply the bitcoin volume, and nothing else ([proof]( What is important to note is that the transaction volume would be expected to slump as price rises if the economy stays the same size (which is logical when you assume that say there's a market for 1 socks/day, so when the price is twice as high, and the sock costs the same amount of USD, then there'd be half the bitcoin transaction volume for those socks). So the chart staying unfazed by the explosive rise in price indicates that the bitcoin economy **transaction volume is rising along with the price**
* What's the third chart even supposed to mean? Average transaction volume in USD vs. price times 5? I don't even know what that's supposed to be, but apparently it's a smoking gun of some kind, what kind only the author seems to fathom.

There's always bubbles and busts when humans are trading things. What matters is the long term trend, and that one looks very promising for bitcoin regardless of what hypes and manias people are trading it for. The real value is in how it simplifies transactions and kneecaps the traditional financial industry. Bitcoin is doing to money, what the Internet did to computers.
If you take a long view and think about how we're going to exchange value say 100 years from now. Are we still gonna pass around physical tokens? No. Are we gonna be in servitude to creditors who lend us money so we can spend it and they get a percentage and a say in who can spend money? Heck no. So what's it gonna be? Well, something like bitcoin sounds like a pretty good bet.

Well, as I say, catalysis is not listed as a use for gold anywhere that I could find. Which suggests it's pretty much a niche use. Now if you think that catalysis using gold would be a market that'd require upwards of 3000tons/year, yeah, it would matter. But even the market for platnium, whose main use is as a catalyst only covers some 150 tons/year (we stick platinum in cars and powerstations ffs).
So you're trying to argue gold is valuable because 0.06% of available gold (or about 2% of yearly production) might be used as a catalyst, even though the actual use of it today in that role is probably closer to 0.0006% of available or about 0.02% of yearly production.
That's straight in the category of gold foil in satellites, UV filters for astronaut helmets and use by gold plating in conductors, it just doesn't matter in the big picture of valuation. Reserves in existence would cover over 150'000 years of use, and yearly production exceeds use by 500000%. If you where to apply this to fiat, that's like arguing the dollar is deflationary because Ben Bernanke who draws his salary from the government is eating out once a week in a posh restaurant.
That's not a circular argument. For whatever reason that hasn't got anything to do with actual use, gold is valued to levels that sustain production far beyond any conceivable use. Platinum is less rare than gold (it's about 3x as abundant in earths crust) and we only produce about 150 tons of the stuff a year. Platinum is also far more useful, so if the demand was there, ramping up production would be no problem.
If you want to estimat the true price of gold based on actual use, the price per troy ounce would have to be in the range of about $60/oz.

0.014 was a good call. But then they kind of deprecated against btc down to 0.002, which was where I bought back in. And now they're doing quite a run.
I think the reason this happens is that they're basically depending on the attention/health/valuation of bitcoin. The miners never stopped cranking up NMC/LTC difficulty but the price didn't follow because of a general lack of interest in everything coin-y. Now that interest is trending, they're literally exploding out of their undervaluation.

Hm, aren't you confusing 2.98% interest with 2.95% yield.
The yield is climbing because the bonds are trading lower, not because the interest rose. At the end of those 10 years, the US treasury will still redeem the bond for face value and have paid you the interest due on it, it's just that you got to buy that bond at a lower price, that doesn't raise the treasuries debt obligations.

Well, issue was that the other commentors couldn't concisely explain why that's impossible to a layman, although it is concisely explainable.
Bitcoins are a distributed ledger of transactions. Each transaction requires the spender to prove that he has the right to execute it. He does that by signing it with his private key. Each 10 minutes the ledger gets validated by the network and double spendings or wrongly signed transactions get rejected. A recipient is only really in posession of the coins if the transaction has been validated by the network.
So counterfeiting is near to impossible for two reasons:
* The cryptographic hash function used to sign transactions is very strong, so attacking it is difficult.
* A phony transaction can be validated by the recepient and is encouraged only to be treated as valid once the network has independently confirmed it. Many exchanges treat 6 validations as sufficient. More paranoid may require any number of validations.
Of course if anybody tried to explain that to the clueless guy, he'd just had him cut-off mid-sentence after 3 words. But meh.

No, but the way that prices are **supported** gives it validation. Speculation alone can't account for consistently rising floors. Speculation can account for wild swings, but over the long term this is noise. So when you see a price level supported over long periods of time, it means that something else than speculation is supporting it.


* Some businesses offer discounts

Try buying something with bitcoin sometimes, it's amazing, even at its current somewhat consumer unfriendly state.
What you forgot to ask is what bitcoin offers merchants:
* Lower transaction cost
* Faster transactions
* No intermediaries (like paypal) that can block you
* No chargeback fraud


Bitcoin (like facebook and twitter) enjoy the network-effect benefit. The more people there are using it, the more attractive it is. For an altcoin to offer a credible threat to bitcoin it has to have the following characteristics:
* Be substantially better than bitcoin, while incorporating all of bitcoins features.
* Have these improvements be fundamentally incompatible with bitcoin (i.e. not be threatened to be subsumed by bitcoin adopting those features)
* Win the network-effect lottery


A substantial innovation of bitcoin is counterparty-risk free, secure, transactions. Institutionally backed altcoins cannot by their very definition offer this advantage. And hence such an altcoin would come with all the usual caveats that brought you paypal, visa, mastercard, paper-gold, egold, liberty-reserve, world of warcraft gold and so forth.


The answer to this is nobody knows. The argument that only instruments backed by something, are worth anything, is making an unspoken assumption. The assumption is: Only if you have a real physical object backing an instrument, is that instrument reasonably secure from manipulation (i.e. inflation).
There are two counter arguments I would point to:
* Bitcoin proves (not attempts, or tries, but does) that it is possible to have immaterial goods, that are safe from manipulation/inflation and that don't require counterparty-risk.
* Backed instruments (like paper money, paper-gold etc.) aren't as secure from inflation, because they require counterparty-risk (you need to trust the issuer). It's historical fact that gold-backed instruments so far have always had trouble staying on the gold backing.

EC cryptography depends on a set of coefficients for the curves. The NIST standard on this has been published long ago, and right when it was published, the first comments that where made where that the coefficients can't be shown to be derived from any process (such as specific digits from a constant, a pseudorandom number etc.). The NIST, US government and NSA have remained silent against this critisism and the opponents of the coefficients where laughed out and ridiculed as tinfoil fashion sporting conspiracy theorists.
I believe that Satoshi knew about this discussion, as anybody who's even a little bit into cryptography is knows. And I believe that, like many, he might have had nagging doubts about the NIST standard because of that.

I fail to see how it would stabilize things. If there was some easy way to drop it in as an exchange instead of another Gox that'd be fine. But far as I understand it, that will never happen.
Ripples run on XPRs (their coins). They somehow have &lt;insert magic here&gt; to exchange account balances in fiat -&gt; XPRs -&gt; fiat. Ok, fine, I can run with that.
But now you want to receive $20k trough ripple. How does ripple know the sender actually has the fiat, and is going to make it travel around? So far as I can ascertain, you don't know that. So your account balance in ripple is whatever the hell you say it is. You create it from thin air. Then you send somebody ripples and presto, in a few minutes the fiat land in your ripple account. XPRs are irreversible. For all intends and purpose of the system, money has now changed hands. But wait, the guy who claimed to have the fiat does a no-show. But, I have the XPRs for that amount. So technically I can now spend those to pay somebody else, though the guy who was supposed to pay me, never did. Somehow magically there appeared now $20k of money in the system, but nobody put it in...
I just don't get it.
But ok, maybe that's not how it works. Maybe you have to gain the XPRs (which btw. decay over time) in some way that involves spending fiat to get them. Ok great, now the XPRs represent value. But wait, you want to send somebody $20k trough ripple. How the hell do you get the XPRs for it? Nobody in your "path of flowery trust" has that XPR liquidity... So where's the liquidity to convert Fiat to XPRs coming from?
I still don't get it.
Ok but maybe that's not how ripple works either. But then I look at their homepage, and it's all PR-speek all the way down. No statement of what's actually going on. How do I even know I can trust this? Has anybody verified how that thing works? Is it actually resistant to attacks? Well, no software released, and they say they're not relying on proof of work... so. Not really.
What is is this? The social network of currencies? I still don't get it.
Ok, but maybe that's also not how ripple works. But wait, if that's all of it not how it works, how does it actually work? Fuck knows. And let's say I'm a merchant and I want to receive ripples... When do I get them? Months later? In minutes? And where's the money come from, in the end, really? So when I've got to make my monthly bottom line, and I didn't find anybody to convert my ripples to money, what do I write there? "This is how much we earned... maybe". Really?
I still don't get it.

Two blockchains in a simple fashion doesn't work. You need to keep accounts correct, which means you need to prevent double spending.
Suppose you have two chains and somebody broadcasts a transaction which gets picked up by miners to package into a block.
Now let's say two miners at the same time pick up your transaction, but each works on a different blockchain. So they both produce a block that's valid in respect to their blockchain (the transaction wasn't double), but if you look at both chains, then the transaction is doing double spending because it now exists in both blockchains.
So from this follows that if you want to follow trough with this scheme, that the network would have to validate each new block of one blockchain, against every chain, before considering it valid. However, that doesn't solve the scalability problem, if you need to sync with all blockchains in order to verify a transaction for whatever purpose, you're still achieving zero scalability.

There's interesting altcoins, that do genuinely new and interesting things. Things that Bitcoin can learn from. I'm not gonna argue if Litecoin is one of those or not. But I am gonna argue that for instance Namecoin is one, because it solves a completely orthogonal problem, in a neat fashion, that bitcoin doesn't solve, and so far hasn't shown any plans of solving.
And regarding the threat, it's actually pretty simple. If bitcoin doesn't "make it", so will none of the altcoins. Have you looked at what happens to all the altcoins when bitcoin is in a slump? yeah, that.

Bootstrapping a currency, contrary to popular belief, is actually really really hard. It is so hard because in order for it to mean something, it doesn't just have to work technically, it also has to represent value. Without a central authority, value is what people believe it is worth and are willing to exchange it for. So the big big problem is how do you convince people the currency is worth anything?
Bitcoins answer to this problem is mining. But still, it takes a long time to get the momentum of opinion of value going.
So any new cryptocurrency (and there is no lack of them) comes up against this problem. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to reddit or minecraft clones. Yes, there are lots of them, but none of them capture significant mindshare, despite what the odds might suggest from the sheer number of reddit and minecraft clones.

You'll have a problem doing that. For if you do, you're gonna have to declare any gaming loot and currency illegal. For that matter, you'll have to declare credit institutions illegal. In fact you've got to declare modern banking illegal entirely. No more Valve, Blizzard, Eve-Online, Visa, UBS, Mastercard, Debit cards, and so on and so forth.
You'll have to declare illegal people exchanging value without using issued real world fiat. Not the finicky bits&amp;bytes hopping around the network and making the world tick. No more bartering of any kind.

Don't forget the other deflation == bad argument usually used by inflationists. They say:


Without outside intervention, inflation/deflation depend on the balance of demand and supply for goods. Deflation can happen because:
* Demand is declining and supply is not (that's a bad economy)
* Demand is static and supply is expanding (that's a good economy)
* Demand is declining but supply is expanding (that's a strange economy)
It just so happens that everytime we observe deflation, it's because demand is collapsing. That's not causation, that's correlation. Remember, correlation is not causation.
Bitcoin shows deflation **not** because demand for goods obtainable in bitcoin is collapsing, that would mean bitcoins economy is contracting, and that's not the case. Bitcoin has deflation because the monetary base is increasing by a fixed and small rate, but the supply of goods obtainable with bitcoin is exploding. That's because bitcoins economy is growing. A growing economy is a good economy.
Another more subtle argument in these discussions is usually that all things being equal, why would an inflationary economy be inferior to a deflationary economy? In a deflationary economy if:
* the economy is overproducing against a static demand (deflation), then it encourages people to spend less (their money will be worth more tomorrow), thereby putting a damper on unsustainable economic trends, the economy has auto corrected.
* the economy is underproducing against a static demand (inflation), then it encourages people to spend more (their money will be worth less tomorrow), thereby stimulating the laggard economy, the economy has auto corrected.
Inflationary economy is not auto correcting, it needs to be coaxed to be in a functioning state constantly. Therefore inflationary economics is unsafe, inefficient and inferior.

There's always oscilations in the valuation. It could have a downside to $20 or less, or it could soar to whatever fantasy number and swing back to $100. Who knows. We know some things however that are 100% certain.

* It is a useful technology compared to the alternatives
* The cap of 1 billion dollars is not anywhere near large enough to transact a serious scale of economy with it.

Competition is good. There's over 80 actively run altcoin variants. But Litecoin isn't exactly like bitcoin, there's some important differences:
* Litecoin uses scrypt hashing, which can't be run well on ASIC hardware, so it appeals to a different market segment of hashing operators.
* It's got a blocktime of 2.5 minutes, which means you can have 6 confirmations inside of 15 minutes.
* The cap is 82 million litecoin, and it matures faster than bitcoin.
If that's better or worse than bitcoin is up to the market to decide really. I know that the block time in bitcoin was chosen for a specific reason, and that if you make it too short, you're gonna run into all kinds of problems (like the kind of problem that feathercoin has had).
Overall, litecoin's a bit boring an alternative, it hardly adds anything substantial. I think namecoin is much more interesting, because it solves a real problem that bitcoin (and litecoin doesn't) which is name resolution without the hirarchy of trust that is DNS.
Another interesting coin is probably anoncoin. Although it hardly deviated any from bitcoin (yet), it's going to be interesting to see what features they tack on to solve some of bitcoins anonymity issues (and then to see if bitcoin is going to adopt some).
I'm a bit sorry for primecoin, it's such a cool idea, but, recent advances in prime number theory have made finding prime numbers much easier.
I haven't heard of a PI-coin yet, anyone? (or TAU coin, you PI haters) :)
There's plenty of unique problems for which a specialized coin could offer a solution, especially if bitcoin isn't going to cover that. But that really doesn't invalidate bitcoin, or litecoin. It just means that there's different coins for different purposes, and they happily co-exist. Except those too similar to the one everybody is using, because of the network effect, they're going to be marginalized until they offer something uniquely different.

Gold backwardation?
Far as I understand it, that is when the spot price exceeds the futures price because physical demand is high so supply is exceeded.
Why is that bad?
UPDATE: oh, I get it. To bring the gold price in line with the futures prices (and back to contango) there'd need to be arbitrage of people willing to part with their gold and take on a futures contract. In times of monetary turmoil that seems to be unattractive (I don't know the reason for that yet). But it means people are willing to pay a premium to get a more "solid" security (paper gold) rather than a more flimsy one (paper gold futures). The last time gold was in backwardation was around 2007/2008 (date rings a bell?). So there's the theory that gold is the canary in the commodities mine, and that a backwardation indicates that the commodities market is bracing for impact.

So you did trade with small amounts and you are mashing the order buttons wildly.
You see there's a problem, exchanges have limited capacity. Limited bandwidth, limited CPU time, limited RAM etc. Those are real world scarce resources, you can't snip with a finger and make them appear.
However HFT traders have been hogging those resources heavily, doing lots and lots of small trades, and nobody else could trade.
That's been bad for the exchange, bad for its users and bad for bitcoin.
So the solution to these problems is higher fees, selective lag and minimum trade sizes. It might suck if you're looking to do hairtrigger trading. However, it's better for everybody else.

There was a link the other day where they talk about lifting the block size limit as a means of scaling, and how that might be feasible because only full-nodes need to download the entire chain.
While I agree that this will make it usable beyond the 7tx/s that would be possible today, I don't think that this will hold out terribly long once you get into that vertical section.
The reason is that while increases in blocksize might help scale a factor of 10x or so, they don't help to scale a factor of 10'000. Visa transacts a peak of about 10k tx/s, bitcoin currently does a bit less than 1tx/s.
Imagine a blocksize of 10gb, every 10 minutes. That means you'll need a sustained bandwidth of 130mbit/s down, flat, just to keep up with new blocks arriving. But usually full-nodes also answer block queries, which exceed the block download traffic by a factor of about 10... So you'd need a 1.3gbit/s up, flat, to be even able to service the network sufficiently.
To store the blocks you'd also need to have storage media that can accept 2.4tbyte/day, or roughly 1pbyte/year.
No, increasing the block size is not a sustainable way to vertically grow. It's a stopgap measure that can buy us some more time.
Now it's a great pitty that a fundamentally decentralized system is limited by having a single, shared atomic lock (the blockchain, the shared ledger) to keep it back.
Still, the shared ledger is important to provide safety of the transactions, it's the only known mechanism to man to achieve double spending excluded keeping of accounts.
But, perhaps this could be solved if you had multiple block-chains. Each account would live on one of the chains. Sending coins around in one chain would work just like today. But sending coins from one chain to the next would be different. How to send coins from one chain to another is the most important problem to solve. Because once you have solved that problem, and solved it in a fashion that doesn't simply lockstep all chains, but makes them truly scalable, you can easily scale to 10'000 blockchains.
Now the problem with altcoins is this. Yes, altcoins can increase the transaction limits, decrease the transaction time, and heck, since they are their own chain, they add more network capability by default, and that's fine. But one, or two, or a dozen altcoins, even taken together, still don't solve the 10'000tx/s problem. You'd need roughly 10'000 altcoins to do that. And then you'd still need a way to exchange all those altcoins for each other...
And we're back to sending coins across blockchains problem.
Now let's suppose an altcoin does crack that problem, it's exceedingly likely bitcoin will want to integrate that feature pretty soon.

The ghash double spends are nasty, but they're not threatening, and here's why:
The various gambling sites do something that's essentially unsafe to begin with, which is to use zero-confirmations and fulfill a delivery they can't undo.
This isn't appropriate use of the protocol.
* Appropriate use  of zero-conf: e-commerce. Because let's say you're amazon, you can instantly confirm payment, but delivery takes days, so that's plenty of time to wait for confirmations so you don't fullfill an order that's double spent.
* Appropriate use  of zero-conf: Micropayments and small amounts. Because nobody is going to bother attempting a zero-conf double spend to defraud you of $20.
* Appropriate use  of zero-conf: revokable digital delivery. Anything like games on steam, games on consoles, books that're DRMed (like kindle) or any form of online subscription. You can immediately confirm and deliver, but if the payment was a double spend, you just revoke the delivery again.
Inappropriate use of zero-conf: Immediately confirm and issue non revokable goods delivery.
So gambling sites are targeted by ghash because they do something incredibly stupid, not because ghash would do something incredibly dangerous or unanticipated. Every merchant integration article/tutorial on bitcoin you can find advises you not to make unrevokable delivery of any good before you've not got 6 confirmations. None advise you to do it with zero-confirmations. If the value of the deliverable is low, you might entertain less confirmations because it's not worth it for small sums.

No, the demand isn't going to disappear. But the front for that demand has disappeared. Think of it like this.
When was the last time you heard in the press "Oh the USD is doomed, they took down that dealer on the corner."
You haven't heard that of course. And the reason you haven't is because the "front" in that case has a very small share of the market. If you went and say, took out HSBC or Bank of America, then you'll hear it: "the dollar is doomed".

I think there's a reasonable case to be made to own both.
Bitcoin will be very volatile for the forseeable future. Gold isn't as volatile. Suppose there's a payment you know you'll need to make in the future (buying a new car, paying rent, paying employees, taxes, etc.). Now suppose you held bitcoin, but at the day you need to make the payment, the price has gone all against you. Sucks to be forced to convert (to fiat or goods or salary or rent) at the worst possible time.
So what you want is a way to "lock-in" a certain price. That means converting to a less volatile asset. As long as fiat is relatively stable, you can use fiat for that. But what if fiat, at the time, isn't stable?
That's where precious metals come in. They're likely to be more stable than either fiat (in a crash) or bitcoin (for the time being).
So if you're so inclined to speculate on the precious metals, this basic reasoning applies to people no matter if they can have, or hold bitcoin, or fiat. In a crash the precious metals are still probably the asset with the least volatility, and to run business as usual, you need to be able to lock in some wealth stably.
Additionally, there'll always be a need to be able to exchange without a mobile phone and internet connection. Maybe because the shop you're in doesn't have a connection, or maybe because your mobile phone can't reach the network, or maybe you broke your mobile phone, or maybe the whole internet is intermittently down etc. So it would kinda suck not to be able to buy groceries because of that. So precious metals can be the backup for everywhere you can't use bitcoin.
This will probably lead to an increased demand in precious metals which could be undervalued by one or two orders of magnitude. It'll also likely lead to an increased demand in cryptocurrencies, which might be undervalued by more orders of magnitude, but will probably be more volatile.

1. Complete bunk: You're thinking of the fully banked, having multiple credit cards and bank accounts and enjoy the full benefit of every conceivable financial service. As soon as you start shooting holes in the idea, take out building blocks of these services out, as is the case for many of the unbanked, underbanked and discriminated against (this actually includes 6 to 7.8 billion people), then bitcoin becomes hugely attractive for all parties involved.
2. Complete bunk. Wire transfers take days, sometimes weeks, sometimes they don't arrive at all. CC payments are instantly confirmed, but the actual money doesn't make it around into your account for days or weeks later. And even when it has arrived, it's subject to chargebacks at any time, so it's not really yours to spend to begin with. Bitcoin on the other hand, you can instantly confirm the payment (zero-conf) and after an hour you can see it as permanent, you're now free to spend those bitcoins and do whatever you want with them, they're irrevokably yours. You're trying to compare apples and oranges.
3. Again utter bunk. Amazon, like any retailer, can't just accept payment and "hoard" it. They've got to pay whoever gave them the goods in whatever fashion in the first place. If they don't do so, they wouldn't be able to get any more goods to sell in the future, that's not a sustainable business model. Also, they can't "own" a portion of the blockchain to "double spend", you basically seem to have not the faintest clue how bitcoin works. Outright hoarding of coins (i.e. speculation) can be done with bitcoin, as with any other asset. But usually companies who aren't hedge funds don't do that, the risks in speculation are, to put it bluntly, insane on an institutional level.
4. Bitcoin isn't anonymous. It isn't insecure and it isn't inaccessible. Bitcoin is synonymous, which can be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on your concerns and preferences. Users should use bitcoin in the fashion aligning with their preference. Bitcoin has never been hacked, it's not insecure. Wallets can be stolen, which an entirely different topic, and the subject of an array of hardware wallets that are cropping up. Bitcoin is the most accessible currency in existence, period.
5. Complete bunk, the current financial system is vastly more likely to disrupt itself without any help of bitcoin.
6. Complete bunk, many older people are using bitcoin. The old are not technically illiterate. The technically illiterate are technically illiterate, and there's nothing that bitcoin can do or don't do to change that.
7. Complete bunk, governments will have much less trouble detecting tax evaders by inspecting the blockchain then they will have with traditional financial institutions. Complete bunk, bitcoin isn't ever going to replace fiat currencies (of which governments can print and lend as many as they want). It can co-exist with fiat currencies. You're going down a line of argument that goes like "gold is bad, people can use gold, that threatens fiat currency". It's delusional at best.
8. Complete bunk, "new things change things, I don't like change, change bad", seriously?

Arbitrage Advanced...
Either market buys apples cheaper than they sell them. The price at which they buy apples is called bid, and the price at which they sell is called ask. Bid is always lower than ask, and often there is a gap. This is called spread. Let's say each market has a 2% spread, so when you arbitrage you need to buy into the asks and sell into the bids, making it a total of 4% difference.
But wait, each market also charges a fee in apples so you can buy apples from them, let's say each market wants 0.5% fee, so a pair trade carries a 1% fee.
Now while you execute your pair trade, you might be reacting to old data, or the orders you enter don't get executed immediately while the price moves against you and so forth, so let's say that in 10% of cases you make a loss, and in 90% of cases it works. This is called risk, so you need to calculate that in as a cost, of 10%.
Risk + Fees + Spread = total cost of the trade = 15%
But you also want to make a profit, let's say you want to profit for a third of the cost, so 5%. This is called profit margin.
Risk + Fees + Spread + profit margin = target difference = 20%
So if the prices between the markets exceed the target difference, you pull the trigger on the trade. If they do not, you don't.

I believe that removing SR is good for bitcoin, for several reasons:
* SR occupied around 4% of the bitcoin economy, which is a huge chunk, so any aspiring SR successor will have to start from scratch, and it's unlikely any single one will be able to capture 4% ever again.
* SR comandeered about 30kbtc in constant circulation and about 500kbtc in stashed coins. That's a huge whale to burst to the surface anytime DPR wants to cash coins. Whale -&gt; uncertainty. Uncertainty -&gt; depressed valuation. Kill a whale, remove uncertainty, more confident valuation.
* The most prominent association with drugs has been taken off the table, which is good to know (others will grow in its place, but slowly, and none will capture as much as SR alone).
* The FBI acknowledged bitcoin as having legitimate uses, a small bonus, but nevertheless. Yay.
* The US govt. now sits on about 30kbtc and if they can lay their hands on DPRs stash, it might be up to 500kbtc. This puts them in a fairly funny situation legally. That's going to be interesting to watch.
* 1/24th of the bitcoins in existence have been taken out of the equation for the forseeable future, that's good for valuation.

To find a block you will have to:
* Hash the block (producing an sha256 hash)
* Compare it to the target
ASICminers are nothing else than efficient sha256 hashing machines. Stick string in, get many hashes out (bumping the noonce part of the string).
In theory they could be used to attack sha256 hashes brute-force. However that requires a rainbow dictionary (a list of strings you target).
Rainbow dictionaries are not possible for blocks, because they're not comprised of expectable, fixed strings, but rather contain random parts as well as unforseeable data (list of transactions etc.)
But if you're hashing passwords, that are possible to attack with rainbow dictionaries, then a 60gh miner will probably be able to crack a sha256 password hash in less than a second if it's not properly salted (including a random part to make rainbow dictionaries impossible).
That's a reason why hashing often takes the form of sha256(sha256(data+salt)). You would first have to attack the first hash, which is a 256-bit number, and so has 10^77 combinations. If you wanted to store a dictionary of that you'd need storage room for 10^76 bytes. The number of atoms in the observable universe is about 10^78. Building very many of those harddisks to store the sha256 rainbow dictionary could prove... difficult :)

So you'd adjust to coordinate at a random time that you publizize in a forum... &lt;facepalm&gt;, and you'll lose a few coins.
Alright, you stop posting public information about shakeouts and you pick a random time and you're involving say 50 big stakeholders. But a few annoying big holders don't honor your made-up agreement and pre-sell, and you're losing a few coins.
Frustrated with how it all falls appart you're now doing the shakeout all by your lonesome at random times. Got enough coins for that? Reasonably any shakeout is a risk, somebody might buy back before you can. And you'll need a heap of coins to do it, say about 20kbtc would do it. Of course you shouldn't risk more than 10% of your holdings on trades, so you should hold more than 200kbtc. Not that many people who have that kind of holding, and I'm betting they're not gonna give a shit about shakeouts.

I don't think that would work for two reasons.
The first reason is that "exchange" implies you exchange one thing for another thing, for instance USD &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has solved the issue how to transfer ownership in bitcoins, it has not solved the issue of how to hold USD digitally. Let's imagine for a moment, that there was such a thing as, let's call it an USDcoin of the same working principle as Bitcoins. Separate chain, all that. In theory you could then have a third system building a chain of exchanges of USDcoin &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin. But has that helped you really? How do you exchange USDcoin to USD? Who says that one USDcoin has to be one USD? I'd dare you find an exchange service that accepts USDcoin at 1:1 against USD for as long as people can mine USDcoin. But let's say you had a bunch of exchanges that are honor bound (scouts honor) to exchange them 1:1 no matter what, what's to prevent another exchange offering more? Say 1.2USD:1USDcoin? So in the attempt to solve the distributed exchange problem, you've now created the same problem of a central exchange, only now you have two major Cryptocurrencies to deal with. Instead of getting easier, the problem got harder.
The second reason of why it wouldn't work distributed is because distributing the task takes time (the churnover so everybody can verify the new transaction chain or reject it). It's not instant, it's not even in the range of reasonably fast. It takes a long time (minutes, hours maybe, who knows). That is a problem for multiple reasons.
* You will need to perform a matchmaking of bid/ask. If you cannot discover bids/asks fairly quickly, you cannot satisfactory fill orders contained in the system. This will directly influence liquidity in that less exchanges will be made than people have standing exchanges that could be filled. And you will not know until 10 minutes later which orders where filled.
* A goodly chunk of the liquidity in a market is provided by people who are high frequency traders. Twitchy fingers, arbitrageurs, algorithmic traders, what have you. If you take that out, then those sources of liquidity are gone.

The "justification" for this expectation is that:
* txfees have gone up fairly reliably in equal measure with transactions.
* Bitcoin does about 50'000 transactions/day. Visa alone does more than 200'000'000/day. That means bitcoin has so far captured about 0.025% of transactions that one credit card provider does, out of a multitude of credit card providers. There's ample room for growth.
I have done projections on txfees and I come to the same conclusion. Somewhere before 2017 txfees exceed 12.5btc. And projecting out further (at which point bitcoin still would be in the single digit percentage share of the CC transaction market) it'll grow to &gt; 50btc.
It's fairly certain that the block limit is gonna be solved, wouldn't be much good as a system if it couldn't grow anymore.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that mastercoin, fundamentally, can't work.
They derive their mastercoin from a specific bitcoin address, which was funded prior to the exodus block.
So far so good, nothing wrong with calling these bitcoins now mastercoin and trading these, except that doesn't seem to be what mastercoin attempts to do.
It seems that mastercoin attempts to use these bitcoins now as a carrier for messaging. Essentially using the blockchain to emit messages that carry meaning to clients which presumably would understand mastercoin.
These messages carry meaning, such as sending of coins, trading and so forth, quite like bitcoin transactions carry meaning for bitcoin. But there's an important difference. In bitcoin you cannot generate a faulty block by including transactions that can't exist (such as creating bitcoins out of thin air, double spending, etc.). You can't because if you do, that block will be rejected by everybody else by way of not basing their next block on yours. So your chain will be orphaned and the one with the most work that is valid will win.
This functionality is central to securing the funds of everybody. You can think of it as a built-in "undo". If somebody tries to do things that would put everbodies funds in jeopardy by violating the rules by which bitcoin operates, that block is ignored and you go back to the last valid block and base your next block on that one.
But in mastercoin, if somebody emits a message that puts everybodies mastercoins at jeopardy, by going against the rules that mastercoin operates in, there is no way to undo that message by the network. Because the bitcoin network doesn't adhere by the rules of mastercoin, it adheres by the rules of bitcoin. So that exploitative transaction in mastercoin will live forever.
I have played this scenario trough in my head many a time. It essentially comes down to the simple fact that a globally serialized communication channel isn't sufficient to implement a cryptocurrency that follows rules such as to keep everybodies funds secure. You need a communications channel that only permits valid messages, so you need a mechanism that can exclude invalid messages. And that's what bitcoin does, and mastercoin doesn't.
It seems to me that it would be quite foolish to expend bitcoins to obtain mastercoins.

Well tx-fees are still a small percentage (any idea how much?) of the block reward. But fees are finicky as the price rises (they tend to drop), and they'll not make up a large part of the reward for some time.


I'd really rather see that being reinvested into the infrastructure full than putting any of it into dividends. The real fight's on the infrastructure IMO.


Well it depends what your strategy is. If you're re-investing the dividends to get more shares then the risk of holding the shares is higher then when you're not doing that. Regardless, holding shares is a risk because the movement in share price can easily wipe out any profit from dividends or make a loss.
Take for instance without re-investment:
* Buy 10 shares at $1btc/share --&gt; -10btc
* Get dividends --&gt; +5btc
* Sell shares for 0.5btc/share --&gt; +5btc
* Total: 0btc
With reinvestment:
* Buy 10 shares at 1btc/share --&gt; -10btc
* Reinvest dividends during the year to buy 5 more shares ~1btc/share
* Sell 15 shares for 0.5btc/share --&gt; +7.5btc
* Total -2.5btc
That's why I worry about higher share prices, and that's why I advise for a btc-cost average. The risk of holding the shares is substantial, and the share price seems to have entered a time of increased volatility.
I'd like to hold the shares for a long time, far beyond a year. And I'd like to fund ASICMiner in the small way I can because I think that they're doing important work. I think that long-term investment is far preferable than shorter term speculation. And of course I'd like to avoid making a loss :)

The recent $1000'ish spike has not yet arrived, and skilled miners will have sold some bitcoin at the top to put into mining hardware due to come online in the next 2-6 months.
At least that's my speculation on where the hashrate is gonna go, todamoon, so to speak, err an exahash somewhere mid 2014.

No? In 2011 the USD fell from 1.1 against the CHF to 0.7. You know what stopped it? CHFs being printed by the bucketloads to buy USD.
Now we're falling together. And you know what I noticed, last year alone my cost of living went trough the roof like it didn't do the years before that. A simple breakfast goes for 20chf here. It used to be around 10chf 2 years ago. 3 years ago 50kchf got me trough a year and allowed me to put savings away. in 2012 50kchf barely left me anything and I'm stuttering off my debts to the tax office and social security because I don't even have the money to pay that. Yeah, that's right, if you're a single non married guy living in a 1-room flat in switzerland, you're now functionally poor if you earn less than 50kchf. So fuck you ok?

No they won't. And there's a simple reason why they won't. Let's say USD &lt;-&gt; BTC. The most traded currency pair around the bitcoin economy.
Say you have a block chain of "$coin" and a blockchain of bids/asks for $coin &lt;-&gt; Bitcoin.
**Problem 
How do you ensure that everybody accepts 1 $coin/USD? You can't have the $coin be decentrally produced, or the exchange rate to USD isn't 1. Likewise you can't have people just claiming they have $coin, there'd just be cheating. And lastly, you can't have a central authority that mints $coin because they'd be shutdown by the government, and the government isn't interested in running a $coin mint. So while in theory you can bid/ask across blockchains, it won't work because there's no feasible mechanism to introduce $coin.
**Problem 
Let's suppose problem  is solved somehow. A distributed trade block chain would just be spammed by manipulators with trades where they repeatedly trade small sums between their own accounts to make the price look depressed or enthusiastic, when in reality it isn't. It would be even easier to manipulate than MtGox.

@_date: 2013-09-04 20:35:15
Both sides of the trade can get scammed. The seller of bitcoins can experience chargeback, and the buyer of bitcoins can experience non-release.
The buyer is protected insofar as a conflict resolution in his favor can release the bitcoins from strongcoins escrow (let's ignore for now how that conflict is actually resolved).
The seller isn't protected from chargebacks, so any conflict resolution on that front would have to happen with his bank.
This is a classical trust issue. One approach to solve this problem is to establish measures of trust in a network. Though this isn't a perfect method. A node in the network can masquarade as a "good", but turn bad later, in which case the dammage that node can do is rather severe.
StrongCoin may solve the issue of OTC/Localcoins somewhat, and it may solve the issues of Gox etc. somewhat, but what it essentially doesn't solve is that it increases the chances of you getting scammed.

Congress is responsible to work out what the government should do, the president is then responsible of assembling a budget from what congress told him to do, and the president has then to send the budget back to congress so they can sign off on what they asked for in the first place. It's part of Congresses job.
The current crisis is political, in that congress refuses to sign off on a budget, that includes the things, that congress asked the president to do, unless they get to attach conditions to the budget that involves dismantling the healthcare law. In other words, the current crisis is entirely political, and congress is holding the whitehouse, senate and supreme court hostage over the federal budget, for reasons only the ultra right wing republicans seem to understand.
(as a sidenote, when something similar happened in australia, the queen had the entire parliament fired) on the grounds that the speaker first failed at his job, and that the dismissal of the speaker then created an imbalance that that made parliament corrupt, and hence parliament was dissolved and put up for reelection entirely by royal decree)
So the next thing that's coming up is the debt ceiling, to understand how that works you need to understand that the US government doesn't print money. It borrows money, from the federal reserve, which is about as federal as federal experess. the FED is a private bank, that has the license to print money, and then give the US government credit. In particular, the treasury is the part that lends money from the FED. The debt ceiling is a regulation that states how big the loan can be maximally, that the treasury borrows from the FED. As the net expenditures and interest exceeds the net income from taxes, the treasury racks up a credit debt. And when that debt bounces against the debt ceiling, either the debt ceiling needs to be lifted (which is congresses job, again) or the treasury has to start defaulting on its obligations (stating that they can't pay for some of the government expenditures they already racked up, or that they can't pay some of the interest on their debt or both). That state would be called a government default, and it would be a very bad (tm) thing. Bad as in, zombies roaming the streets bad.
The US is currently anything between 2-3 weeks away from this. So the government needs to resolve their issues before that deadline passes. Unfortunately, it's again congresses job to raise the debt ceiling, and congress currently seems to be populated by terrorists.
The US has never been in a shutdown that was unilateral as the current one. And if they can't resolve their budgetary differences in the next 3 weeks, which is the smaller of the two issues (the larger one being the debt ceiling), then a resolution on the debt ceiling would seem quite hopless. As you might remember, the republicans tried killing obamacare with the debt ceiling before, and it's with little doubt that they will try to do so again.

New and exciting way to "own" bitcoins, a comparision between your own wallet and this thing:
* Capital requirement: Wallet=**$0** vs. Trust=**$25'000**
* Anual Fee: Wallet=**0%** vs. Trust=**5%**
* Can Spend Coins: Wallet=**Yes** vs. Trust=**No**
* Can Receive Coins: Wallet=**Yes** vs. Trust=**No**
* Safety from seizure: Wallet=**Yes** vs. Trust=**No**
* Security: Wallet=**DIY** vs. Trust=**fingers crossed**
* Fraud/Fractional Reserve/Creative accounting protection: Wallet=**yes** vs. Trust=**hope for the best**

People are already hit by hyperinflation. Regardless of bitcoin. The US is currently dumping its inflation on the world with quantitive easing, and the cost of living for everybody has gone up around 100% in the last 3-5 years globally. Sure, you can still buy a gallon of milk in the US for $2, while it costs $15 in switzerland, it used to be more like $5. They've also ratched up taxes, got rid of progressive taxation, ratched up healthcare insurance costs, ratched up VAT, etc.
When you get to the situation where a single person living in a one-room flat in another country earns more than 3x in currency exchange than the cost of living is in the US, but yet is practically poor because of barely being able to pay the tax and health insurance on top of everything else, something is very, very fishy.

Just a tiny nitpick, I think flattr is a scam. They charge you a fee to be able to receive flattrs. If the account is zero, you can't spend any flattrs, and you can't receive any. If you didn't spend flattrs, they donate them to a charity (or so they say). They charge you a fee to load up your flattr account, and they charge you a fee to withdraw from your flattr account.
In my opinion flattr is a scam disquised as a form of crowdfunding designed to leech every participant in the "flattr economy" of whatever they put in there.

That's pretty spot on. On the eurozone crisis, the term "quantitive easing". That's when some or another government starts printing money like mad to buy USD to prevent a deflation of their currency against the USD. The whole world is starting to bail out the USD as one bank after the other is going belly up in the eurozone. It's not gonna go on forever like this.

I have been warning people for a while now that AMC/VMC is a very [risky proposition]( to speculate on, for a number of reasons.
One of the most glaring reasons is obviously that AMC needs to raise funds and that the variety of IPOs have so far yielded about $50'000-$100'000 (excluding the last round).
Examining the last round, in the last 5 days 1.4 million shares changed hands for a total of 2800btc. Assuming about half of that goes into AMCs pocket that's another $140'000. That brings his companies liquidity into the range, at best, of about $250'000. That's not bad, but still not nearly enough for the couple $ million that he needs to raise to be able to produce chips.
The share volume suggests that AMC is still sitting on the majority of their shares, and that they've still not raised the amount of money to compete in the game with Asicminer. That means AMC is going to continue to aggressively pump their share price, and dump more shares on the market. And that, dear investor, is bad news for you if you buy into the pumps.
Now it doesn't help AMCs share price that he dilluted the shares by listing another 60 million on another exchange, bringing the total share count to 100'000'000. If you are optimistic then you'll expect AMC will beat (or at least draw even) to Asicminer in hashrate. That means that you expect AMC to capture about 30% of the newly minted coins by mining. Which means you'll expect them to get around 1000btc/day from their business operations. Putting the whole of that into dividends would mean around 0.00001btc/share/day. So if you expect the same ROI that you get with asicminer (around 1-2 years) that means an AMC price of 0.003-0.006btc/share is about as far as you can go on optimism.
That means that as far as upwards mobility of AMC price goes, it's already pretty close to as far as it'll ever go.

So first of all, yes, he has some point, wealth is an illusion until you actually realize your profit. And if everybody tried to realize at the same time, as is wont to happen in panics, price crashes and there will be losses.
Now let's get to the point where he's wrong. At any time in trading there are people claiming they know what's gonna happen. They don't. Prophecy and soothsaying is the province of charlatans. Maybe it crashes tomorrow, maybe it's gonna hit a million tomorrow, maybe it never crashes, nobody knows.
That being said, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be obliviouis to the risk. Invest in a manner suitable for these risks. Invest what you can lose. And invest such that if either of the most dramatic scenarios happen, that you are happy with it.
Now, where he errs, dramatically is that bitcoin is not its price. It will not crash to zero and stay there. It tried to do that, but perplexingly, it didn't happen. Why not? Because bitcoin is more than a company, or a financial derivative, or a currency. It is an ingenious system innovating and disrupting an industry that hasn't invented a single thing in 40 years.
Many people believe in this system, and they're in for the long haul. They play for keeps. These people will not only "ride prices down". They will buy right into the crash until it bottoms out at zero, and when it is there, it has nowhere else to go but up again. Because the system is sound. And when it does, those who would have bought right trough the crash, those are the ones the next round of peaks will endow with wealth.
Bitcoin is volatile. And it attracts a lot of peoples attention. But it also weeds out. It weeds those out that are not convinced to their core. The last crash weeded out some, but left more convinced. If the crash ever comes, it'll do the same, and it'll rise again. And again. Like pheonix from the ashes.
So don't fret. Stay calm. Play for keeps. Look at the long picture, the next 10 years. Don't get snared by the prophets and soothsayers, look at the system, look at what's wrong with finance in the world, and make your own decision.
