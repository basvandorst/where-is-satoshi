My proposal is to just remove all Chinese exchanges from the trackers like bitcoinwisdom and such, until China exchanges start providing proven real numbers. After watching that video, I now think that the promise of China banning those fraudulent exchanges is just about the most bullish news you could hope for.
Until someone comes up with real, proven numbers, China's btc-market share is overblown by multiple factors of ten.

The market cap of the US stock market is actually more than all the money that exists in the world. Market cap is a misleading metric. There is not enough money to cover US stocks and clearly shows that it is a ponzi. In 2008 this ponzi scheme almost collapsed when most people wanted to cash out their shares.

I bought bitcoins for $1240 on Mt.Gox, held strong all the way down to 91. Now they are in goxed storage.

At least bitfinex is transparent about its swaps and provides numbers to work with. With btc-e and others we have no idea whether they are just lending out coins of users without their consent.

Let's make China poor, lol.

Of course the puppet masters running this sophisticated ponzi will come up with all kinds of nonsense to hide that there isn't enough to cover their propped up stock market.

Good luck attracting big money with such a primitive system. Demand would dry up.

Would 50 doge do?

A market dominated by mainly peer to peer barter would be a highly inefficient one and the illiquidity caused by such a system would render the whole thing obsolete in terms of competing with fiat currencies. 
Edit: I can barely believe that I just responded to someone who doesn't even understand basic economics. Ok enough reddit for today.

Exchanges are what give bitcoin value. Without them, bitcoin's prices would be much much lower. Since bitcoin and bitcoin exchanges are so closely linked, the poor exchange system is an honest criticism of bitcoin.
