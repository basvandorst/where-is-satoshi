The comparison to CC chargebacks is a bad one. Credit cards are tied to an identity, whereas Bitcoin addresses are not, and the CC company makes acts as a mediator to decide in favor of the merchant or customer. If a customer goes on a chargeback spree with zero evidence the merchants screwed the customer the CC company will side with the merchants.

I haven't thought through all the details of exactly how such a protocol would work, but these are all solvable problems.
We can stuff data in email headers, DNS records, etc. Or clients could even negotiate over email itself and only display a message to a user once it's postage has been paid, or prioritize based on postage amount.
Yes this probably depends on the ability of Bitcoin, or a higher level (off chain) layer, to support microtransaction volumes.
As for giving the fees to miners, again the important thing is it costs the sender money, it matters less where the money goes since it's a negligible amount per email, but in aggregate adds up to make spamming unprofitable.

The level of trust and size of transaction is important in determining how many confirmations you should wait for.
Additionally, instant payment protocols could be built on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:53:37
Comparing Bitcoin confirmation times to the credit card chargeback period is a terrible comparison.
* Credit cards are linked to your identity. Bitcoin addresses are not. You may be able to get away with one or two fraudulent chargebacks but eventually the credit card company will catch on. Bitcoin doesn't care how many times you successfully double spend.
* Just because you initiate a chargeback doesn't mean the credit card company will rule in your favor.
That said, I agree the risk is low for small in-person transactions or virtual goods with minimal marginal costs, especially if you monitor for 10-30 seconds for network propagation and double spend attempts.

I understand the workings of Bitcoin pretty damn well and think this is a valid question.
If transaction volumes continues to grow transaction fees will certainly go up, especially if the 1MB block size limit isn't increased. Even if it is increased, if the transaction volume outpaces bandwidth/CPU/memory increases there will be a point where transaction fees will have to increase to support the costs of running the network.
"Off chain" transactions using technologies such as OpenTransactions are probably the solution.

This should be obvious to most people, but note that just because a service can prove they hold your funds doesn't mean they can't or won't outright steal them in the future. "Proof-of-reserves" only tells you whether or not they have enough funds to cover their obligations, not whether they actually will when it comes down to it.

I agree, I don't think Bitcoin is ready for mass adoption.
On the other hand, the Bitcoin has opened the floodgates and you can be sure there are competitors gunning for Bitcoin. I'm not talking about trivial altcoins, but things like Ripple and probably a whole bunch of stealth projects, perhaps funded by banks or governments.
I think Bitcoin will be much better poised for mainstream adoption in 1-2 years, once we (hopefully) have more clarity on government regulation (in particular in the US), fleshed out technologies to better manage security (hardware wallets, multisig, hierarchical deterministic wallets), and a whole bunch of venture backed companies in the pipeline.

One possible solution to securely changing the the address without going through the proof of identity would be to allow a user to sign a message with their current address telling them which address to update it to.

No, a drop in price makes all mining less profitable, no matter what the hardware is. Once hardware is obsoleted by more efficient hardware the only possible way it would become profitable again is if the price of Bitcoin rises rapidly enough that the production of new mining hardware can't keep up, but it will inevitably be temporary.
It's unlikely to rise fast enough to ever make PC mining profitable (I haven't done the math though).

I would caution people against escalating things too much directly with TigerDirect. They use BitPay, which promises to handle all these crazy weird Bitcoin details for merchants. If it turns out Bitcoin is too much of a hassle for merchants to deal with we could start losing major merchants like TigerDirect, which would be a blow to Bitcoin.
On the other hand, raise as much of a shitstorm with BitPay as you want. They should have a better method to recover transactions in limbo.
To clarify, I agree in theory it is TigerDirect's sole responsibility to deal with BitPay themselves, I'm just saying, practically it may be in the interest of you as a Bitcoin enthusiast/investor/whatever to go straight to BitPay with these issues.

@_date: 2013-11-20 18:37:24
I don't see how that would work. Each block they ignore makes it exponentially harder for their fork to catch up. Miners with stricter policies would have a much harder time keeping up.
I think a better solution would be a self-adjusting block size limit, similar to how the difficulty adjusts itself. See my other comment.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:57:24
You could have a rule that no block may be larger than X times the average size of the last Y blocks or something (or adjust it with each difficulty adjustment). Basically let the protocol slowly scale up over time, but not too quickly.

Not reusing addresses does increase security because the public key isn't publicly known (just a hash of it, aka the address), but normally even knowing the public key shouldn't matter. As others have mentioned that was due to a bug in certain wallets and has been fixed for all known vulnerable wallets.
