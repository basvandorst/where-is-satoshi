I stopped by here with some friends and the place was closed for a local holiday. Called the guy, said he was a couple hours away and not coming back into town that day. Was super bummed, but oh well... Looks like you ran into the same problem! My friends wanted to use the ATM for their first coins, just to say they bought them there I guess.

Where in the airport is this located? Which concourse?

The operator just installed it 2 weeks ago, literally a couple days before I was due to arrive in country. Was surprised to learn that they've already got quite a few around Tbilisi, Batumi, ect.

Well cringe not! This was purely a novelty transaction. Been in the space for a long time.

Required only my fiat and a receiving address. Was 3 or 4 taps on the screen, no KYC that was customer facing.

In the Tbilisi airport on the departing side, right in front of the Georgian and Turkish airlines ticket counters. You can see the big yellow ₿ from the street when your Taxi arrives!

Playing devils advocate, percentage fees don’t matter much if you simply want to convert your Georgian gambling winnings before leaving the country. The machine allowed up to 30,000 Lari to be fed into the machine. Perhaps there are KYC with that volume, don’t know. I’m not endorsing that use case, but doesn’t mean that people aren’t using it for that!

You’re country is beautiful, I really enjoyed my time there. I particularly enjoyed the ‘Chacha’, very strong stuff!

I bought, didn't sell. That 200 Lari was left over from my two week trip. I also wouldn't be opposed to $220k BTC!

No, you have to exit the arrivals terminal and turn right, walk 50ft down the sidewalk to the departing terminal. Buildings are side by side but not joined.

Exchange rate was in Georgian Lari but right around 8%.

Yes, this one was buy or sell. Most are buy only, but nice to have a two way in a pinch I suppose.

I think the Coinstar integration is really interesting, will be interesting to see how other ATM operators compete with the sheer number of their machines already in the wild.

The internet’s great!
