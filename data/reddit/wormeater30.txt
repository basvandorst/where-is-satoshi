Cumulative Bids is the most appropriate way to measure a shit coin since the whales that own 90% of that shitcoin could clear the bid side of the book anytime they want aka cash out.  It WILL happen to at least one major shitcoin.
It has happened many times already- look up deadcoins there’s a list of hundreds of cryptos that went to $0 or close to it and have no volume, no devs, no nodes.

Until we see this happen to an altcoin, followed by a dump in price and anger from community, nobody will care.
Same thing about attack due to centralization of nodes.  Until the worst happens, all the losers will ignore the problem.
Bitcoin is one part solution to problem people recognize, 9 parts solution to problems nobody has yet.  Resiliency is good long term not not short term.

They said that months ago that they MIGHT add it.  5 days ago they said they WONT add it.  Then they added it without even a 1 hour warning.

Hm I wonder why roger would want to pump bcash.... gee can't think of a reason...

He spent time in jail for selling explosives.  He spins it as fireworks, but the type of explosive he sells when you search for it on YouTube you see videos of people being maimed, losing legs, etc.  Not fireworks.
Sadly he got into bitcoin and spends most of his time shilling Alts by lying about bitcoin.
Since he runs a service of sock puppets or as he calls them "birds", he can spam social media.  He will spam whatever you'd like if you pay him.  He uses this to shill his bags before he dumps them.
He's gotten involved with several altcoins but most noticeably bcash. The entire marketing for bcash is based on selling it as bitcoin, saying that it fixes flaws with bitcoin.  In reality bcash has no real development or purpose, it simply changed the size of bitcoin blocks to be larger, which is not something bitcoin devs recommend nor is it something majority community wants right now.
The only thing bcash added during the fork was the "EDA" or emergency difficulty adjustment, which sent block mining on a rollercoaster of difficulty.  Although roger and co pretended this was unintentional, it had two purposes: 1. Allow for blocks to be mined faster than the normal once per 10 minutes without directly changing that spec (plausable deniability).  2. Cause problems with the bitcoin network by having wild fluctuations in mining profitability for bcash, driving bitcoin block times to become almost as unreliable as bcash.  Of course, bcash wasn't actually being used for anything so it didn't really matter that it fluctuated.  It hurt bitcoin, it was an attack.
Roger is trash.  He tarnishes the community and its up to us to point out bad actors before they become the face and voice of the community.
Like any classic snake oil salesmen if you watch him debate he dodges questions and makes constant appeals to emotion instead of logic.  He doesn't care about having quality people on his side, just quantities of suckers to buy his bags, so the more simplistic and emotional his argument the better.  These people who fall for his bullshit don't have a legal or moral right to be protected from scammers but our community should stand up to roger and other scammers and try to help newcomers if we can.

I’ve been following since version 1 but haven’t read every post.  I truly think it can revolutionize torrent protocol and that every single young person will one day know about it and use it.  Just today I was looking for a bar rescue show torrent I could not find because the show was too unpopular and old to have seeders.  I’m sure money incentive would change this.  
How is JoyStream handling micro payments?  Trusted third party or lightning network?

8 dead development teams.
I can make a github page and never work on it too.
I can make a wix.com website and claim I’m a developer.
Smoke and mirrors.
If roger wants some sort of update for bcash he’ll pay a programmer to make it.
That doesn’t mean bcash is open source community developed.

If you have two IDs and build each’s reputation carefully then don’t you deserve the credit given to each? :)
What are the IDs for anyway.?

This provides a very short and non-technical basics of the 2017 and 2018 upgrades to bitcoin protocol: segwit and lightning network (LN).
This sort of article is a gem that can be shared with friends and family who want to learn more about what’s going on with bitcoin but don’t have time or technical prowess.

More like 46 trillion if you include borrowing from social security fund, which is now run as a ponzi (not as intended).  Social security liabilities IS debt.

Centralized exchanges will be regulated.  No going around that.
We should be pushing for more fungibility in BTC RIGHT NOW.  Regulate the exchanges; not the coin!!!!!

It certainly encourages saving while inflationary fiat encourages spending.
It’s hard not to see it as both gold and cash though since it’s so easy to spend.  For every gold  buyer there is a gold seller after all.  This day in age of technological efficiency why bother holding intermediary’s such a fiat?  Why not just go straight from store of value to needed goods (food etc)?
Fiat is an unnecessary intermediary between things we want and store of value (savings, investments).  It’s doomed.  Much like the now-looked-down-upon bank “savings account”.  The fed and banks were too greedy with their fiat and we are going to cut them out using new technology.
And bitcoin is so damn easy to use may as well be using it as cash, or at least slowly increase its use as cash as adoption increases over the decades.

You are better off buying here or dollar cost averaging.  Unless you are a full time trader?
Retesting those lows means we probably are going deeper, may as well hold for 4.5k-5k if we retest that low. A “double bottom” is always possible but less likely than a move up here or a push down to 4.5k-5k.
If you want in, get in.  You can’t time the market or predict the market.  That isn’t what traders do.  Check my post hx.  Traders find periods of asymmetric risk reward.

Uh no lol.  We get chargebacks for $700 at my business and there's nothing you can do.  I've tried.  Have all the paperwork and patient information even their social security number, still can't get the 700$ short of filing a police report.
