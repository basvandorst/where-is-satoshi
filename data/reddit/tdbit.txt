To exchange value on a decentralized blockchain, the entries in the ledger themselves must be valuable.  Otherwise, you need a third party to interpret what the entries mean.  With a token that speaks for itself -- bitcoin -- nobody has to ascribe some value to the ledger.  Everyone knows and trusts that bitcoin's value is the current exchange rate.  Everyone can look at the ledger and know exactly how much value changed hands.

If they created a new blockchain for "crypto fiat," I would imagine it would serve the same function as bitcoin except they would be calling it "crypto fiat" instead of fill-in-the-blank coin.  Using the existing blockchain, I don't see how someone could put some other unit of measurement on top of it.  There has to be a ledger entry to transfer funds, and that entry has to be in bitcoin.  
But my understanding of all of this is pretty limited, so I defer to anyone else who knows more.

The reaction I always get when I tell people about bitcoin:  "How much is it?  That's expensive!  Do I have to buy a whole bitcoin?"  
Even after I tell people they can buy fractions, they always frown at the idea of buying part of a bitcoin and say something like "I want to buy a whole bitcoin, I'll wait until the price comes down or I save enough to buy one bitcoin."

Nobody gives a shit about merchants fees, but people give a shit if they have to pay a fee.  
Not sure if it is still the case now, but back in the day with Full Tilt when you deposited $100, your card would get charged $107 and your account credited $100.  That is huge, especially for poker players where having a 1-2% edge means the difference between winning and losing in the long term.  But as someone says above, those exorbitant processing fees might have just been charged to American players in the past, so it might be a moot point.

What you are describing is a local bank who has contracted with a third party to develop their banking app.  First, I would never download such an app. And if that is what happened here, Coinbase's tweet about the app didn't communicate that.

I'm speaking of short selling in general, not Finex's specific maintenance requirements.  If you short a $10 stock, and it jumps to $100 overnight, you are on the hook for the extra $90, regardless of how much money you put it into your brokerage account and/or their maintenance requirements.  
"Or wherever" - are you specifically aware of the maintenance requirements of every single entity that lets you short bitcoin?  I can let you borrow 1 of my BTC to short it.  And if it jumps (theoretically) overnight to $2,000, I am going to want my $2,000.  I am not going to say "its cool, you only shorted 1 BTC so you can buy it back from around $800."  That's not how shorting works.  
EDIT:  the article says Finex lets you leverage at a maximum of 2.5 : 1, so it would be appear your statement that the most you can ever lose when you short bitcoin is the amount in your account is also wrong when applied to Finex.

Maybe I'm missing your point, but I don't see how an ETF changes the nature of bitcoin itself.

Significant matters involving one currency are relevant to other currencies because they are same asset and market type. 
To illustrate, if there is subreddit on. say, American pork belly futures, and there is news about a pig disease spreading in, say, Poland, I would think that news would be relevant even though it does not specifically mention American pork belly futures by name.  Similarly, news about a currency panic in one part of the world is tangentially related to all currencies because they occupy the same space.

WU has a massive infrastructure in place which comes from being in business over 150 years.  
Convenience from a 150 year head start on infrastructure will only carry you for so long, and Bitcoin is undeniably superior to WU for transmitting money.  It is going to take time, effort, and education to put in place the infrastructure for someone without a bank account to walk up to a counter and hand over fiat, have the fiat instantly converted to bitcoin and transmitted across the world to the recipient, and have that recipient know what just happened and have the ability to seamlessly convert or spend bitcoin.  But it's definitely not impossible and I'm sure there are companies working tirelessly on this in many different countries.

Okay, I think this makes sense.  One description of Bitcoin that threw me off is that Bitcoin is a piece of the ledger, as if the owner of Bitcoin has some sort of property interest in the ledger itself.  When in actuality, it is a recording in the ledger that says this public key holds that much Bitcoin.  In order to transact within the system, you need an entry in that ledger.   And the more Bitcoin you have, the more buying power you have.  It sounds really simple when spelled out, but I think conceptionally spelling it out like this helps get over the "no intrinsic value" hurdle.

If you are using it for financial services, people who talk about separating Bitcoin (or any coin) from blockchain don't seem to understand the function of Bitcoin. From my limited understanding, if I send $10 to someone in England who wants pounds, there has to be some unit of measurement in the ledger that says I put in $10 worth of value so the recipient can get a corresponding value in pounds. Hence, the purchase of $10 worth of Bitcoin. "Buying" $10 worth of Bitcoin is what has to happen for me to use a decentralized blockchain to send money.  Otherwise, how else could someone verify I actually sent $10?  
Bitcoin isn't a superfluous add on like Robinson claims. It serves a necessary accounting purpose for the ledger.

These rewards aren't given to consumers out of the goodness of the credit card companies' hearts.  They make money when you use credit cards.

You don't seem to understand the concept of shorting.  I'm not speaking specifically of Finex's precise maintenance requirement.  I don't have an account there and I haven't tried shorting there. 
Do you understand that when you "short" something, you are borrowing that share/asset, and you are promising to buy it back at a later date?  Is this correct?  Or is this a "misconception" permeating the subreddit?  And that said share/asset can appreciate in value?  It can appreciate, theoretically, 5, 10, or 100 times?  
The money "in your account" is essentially collateral for the loan you took to borrow the share/asset you shorted.  Maybe Finex has maintenance requirements where they liquidate your position if your losses equal the amount in your account, again, I don't know what their specific requirement is.  But those maintenance requirements would be specific to Finex, and there are more liberal brokers who let you borrow more than the amount in your account. 
The fact that you keep referring to "an account" as if it is fixed amount that  you cannot possible ever lose more than when you short something makes no sense.   Hedge funds short.  Look like Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife.  Losses can be huge, and are not capped by some "account."  
Let's say you want to short 1BTC from me today at $400.  If you put $400 into an account, that is collateral for the loan.  Your "account" has $800 worth it in - the $400 you "sold" the 1BTC for, and the $400 collateral you put it.  When you keep referring to as "you can't possibly lose more than what's in your account" is simply what happens when the price hits $800, and I force you to buy back 1 BTC at $800, keeping the collateral.  But if I'm more liberal, and know you are good for it, I don't have to force you to buy it back.  And say it hits $1000 and you want to cover you short position.  You will owe me the extra $200.  There is your explanation of how you can lose more than what's in your account.  A novel concept called "owing" money, which is what happens when you borrow things.

If 'more are on sale' only to a very, very small subset of potential buyers, how does that directly impact the price available on the open market?

Good point, but I'm not so sure the inflation from mining is that significant.

And after the next halving it will be a much smaller % increase.  Either way, one would think the price would go up dramatically after the next halving.

From what I understand, additional decimal places can be added by consensus.  Every single bitcoin will never be hoarded, but even if there is only one satoshi available - by consensus that satoshi can be divided into enough subunits to spread around.  One cent in change can never be divided in this way.  
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:04:39
"Hording" fulfills one of bitcoin's functions as acting as a store of value.  It reinforces bitcoin's price and value.  Moreover, hording has no effect on whether bitcoin spreads because the supply of available bitcoin is infinite by divisibility.  Thus, whether Person A buys and doesn't spend bitcoin in no way diminishes Person B through Z's ability to buy, sell, and spend.

@_date: 2015-04-09 10:59:37
Unlike other things that can be hoarded, if someone buys and holds bitcoin it in no way diminishes anyone else's ability to use it.  The overall supply of bitcoin can be infinite due to divisibility.  Bitcoin is scarce, yet it isn't scarce at all.  That's the beauty of currency that is divisible - humankind has never had that before so it's hard for some to wrap their heads around.  
@_date: 2015-04-20 13:10:05
Good point, but I don't think you would  be running if the approximately 1 min difference between running and walking saves you 3 cents.  However, you might be less inclined to leave your car in a lot for that extra hour because you already paid for it.

I think it removes a step in the process.  Instead of learning about wallets, private keys, maintaining a login and password, etc, the computer takes care of all of that without the user having to think about any of it.  The mining function provides initial liquidity to get the ball rolling.  
This is the first step of payments being built into the IoT.

I feel like we are going in circles here. Any other micropayment system would require some coordination on the part of the participants, and would require a third party to manage the system.  With bitcoin, bitcoin itself is the payment system.  21, I believe, is building the infrastructure to make this possible - but 21 itself will not be a payment system.

It depends on one's risk tolerance.  
If someone has a 55% percent chance to double their money, I would say push that edge as much as you can tolerate, and if that is only 1% you have a very low risk tolerance.  Mathematically, though, you have a very strong edge when you have a 55% chance to double your money.
If you have a greater than 50% chance to 4000x your money, and if you have say $50,000 to invest, and invest $500 while fully believing there is a greater than 50% chance that will grow 4000x, then you are being way beyond incredibly conservative.

He says there is a 50% chance Bitcoin will go up 4000x, so you should have about 1% of your savings in Bitcoin.
I think Casares is brilliant, but this advice is nonsense. Either you believe there is a 50% chance Bitcoin will go up 4000x, or you don't. If you do, then simple math says you should invest far more than 1% of your savings in Bitcoin.

They could get away with fees because they were providing some kind of service - verifying the sender has funds, is debited with funds, and making sure the recipcient is credited.

Good question - it's technically not legislation, its an administrative regulation.   Administrative agencies act under the executive branch of government, they are given power to make "rules" under some legislation giving them that power, which is sometimes pretty broad authority.

It seems one thing the "love the blockchain hate bitcoin" camp can't seem to wrap their heads around is the fact that digital tokens need to be valuable. They have a strong aversion to thinking of valuable digital tokens as currency, but "blockchain shares" may be something they can grab onto. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 18:00:33
Great post.  The fact that BTC is being exchanged across the world with a price that is readily determinable is a near miracle that makes Bitcoin's blockchain far superior to any others.  
Two parties that do not know each other can exchange value because the token itself that is being exchanged is independently valuable.  We don't need BOA or Chase to look at the ledger to interpret and moderate the transaction.  They can create their own blockchains, but absent a token with value that stands on its own, a trusted intermediary is necessary.
