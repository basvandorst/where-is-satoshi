Not saying it should be linked to your BTC address, saying it would be a searchable way to get an invoice to pay to you. Relax guy. What are you, Jason Bourne or something?

Maybe, but most likely most small nodes will connect to at least one big (well connected) one, and the big ones will usually be connected or connected through not that many so I think you won't need more than 4 or 5 hops even then. The theory of network routing has been a topic in computer science for quite a while now so the literature for shortest path finding is quite strong. Will be fun to see in practice in the coming months at this rate, and in years it will be insane if it goes on. What's happening behind the scenes when you send a LN payment really is incredible.

I'm thinking a lot of companies and banks and governments, even gaming sites etc will just keep issuing tokens and everything, like in a way has been happening for a long time with airline flight trust points, tradeable phone money minutes which is common in Africa and so on, and each country will probably have their own thing(s) that the citizens there are used to and trust. What will always be common though across the internet and the world if you'll want to convert or go abroad is Bitcoin and I definitely see space for both it and these other "Currency as a Service" type moneys that represent the status quo.

I just wanna say guys that I really love Bitcoin and seeing Lightning Network blooming like this really gets me so excited. Somehow though it seems quiet. Too quiet. Like the ocean calm and everyone enjoying themselves, having forgotten that there are deadly sharks roaming looking for blood. Like the calm that comes before the storm.

Come on man, enough with the paranoid fundamentalism. Not saying that you have to do it and put it on blast but for convenience I think it would be great when you wanna split a bill or whatever

According to their github, the keys are actually on your device and never leave it. Not sure how exactly, but I think they just let you use their channels operated with the LNDHub wrapper, and at least the on chain segwit wallet on the app is controlled wholly by the user of the app. I've only had good experiences with BlueWallet at least, and it's a great innovation for convenience of use of bitcoin. 
I would actually love it to see other bigger institutions starting to host their own LNDHub and offering this type of service, and I think for less technical people who are used to trusting companies and banks it would be comfortable to use, at least in the beginning of using bitcoin because then they'd have someone to blame if it goes wrong.

Why do you think it's a bad idea? Right now I think if you link 1ml to your node it would be possible to see your balance which I don't think would be that smart if someone has a very high amount in their channels, but I was imagining a way to have a checkings type account, and then some sort of link that you can access which generates an invoice for you without necessarily showing the actual node or balance.

That's fine, but maybe for the people who already gave it up a long time ago which is like 90% of the world it would be a nice service.

I don't think bitcoin fundamentally is about privacy, it's about sovereignty first and foremost, and having a service like this does not disable others from being anonymous. You seem very close minded and a little stuck in your ideals.
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:52:24
Kind of, but I don't see how else it would be possible to run a service like that, and they pay for the channel opening and closing so that's nice. If you end up with a lot of satoshis you can always open up your own channel using another wallet, it's not like you can only send satoshis to other BlueWallets.

No, you're right about the phone number part, it's perhaps not the best. Just the idea of a registry you could use to access people you know or want to pay.

I would imagine it to be quicker in the future as the software becomes more optimized and more nodes come online and connect - and also not sure about this last point but the internet infrastructure and computer hardware may get better.

You should buy $50 of bitcoin and try opening up a channel of your own, and [LNBIG.com]( now open an incoming channel for free to anyone so you can play around with it. If you don't know, an incoming channel is a channel where you have 0 balance, and the other participant have 100%, so you can receive on it. Typically when you yourself initiate the channel with someone else it's the opposite. They charge kind of a high fee (0.08%) or something I think on private channels that aren't meant for routing, but rather actual receiving, but if you just wanna play around I'd say its a good offer.
Lightning wallets have now abstracted away the complexities of making transactions that make channels, so they pretty much just have a button and an address field that you can enter any public node ID of a node you find on [1ml.com]( and you will have a channel set up. You should try to choose a node that is highly ranked and has many connections if you only want to open 1, to ensure you are more likely to find a route quickly.
For convenience and using it on your phone you could set up eclair, LND or c-lightning on your desktop computer and open up channels there, and send a little bit of the satoshis you enable on the lightning network to Wallet of Satoshi or BlueWallet to play around with too. You don't have to leave your computer on to have the channels open, but you should start the node program at least once a week as far as I know to check if the other participant is trying to close the channel with an old state. If the old states are in your favor though (as they would be if you only sent satoshis out) you don't really have to worry at all.
For setting up a node of your own if you don't like the command line then Eclair is the easiest since it has a very nice graphical user interface.

I believe it is running one. This version is equivalent to LND, c-lightning and eclair, although targeting low end simple hardware. Afaik it will be used for applications like IoT devices.

Sorry, it should be "Ptarmigan", not "Ptermigan"
