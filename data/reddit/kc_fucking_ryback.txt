Wasn't Doge supposed to be a joke?  A play on the greed we see in the other cryptos?
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:56:21
yeah.   i also believe it is these large miners pushing the price down.  funding a large operation is different than a hobbyist eating the electric bill each month and just holding coin.

asicminer is rotating some funds from the mining and sales.  Possibly passing on dividends to shareholders tomorrow.

Might want to sit on them until the rules get hammered out regarding money transmitter laws, etc.

I'm getting an error.  It was real slow earlier.  Things are hot in Bitcoin World right now given the price rise.  They may just be bogged down(weekend maintenance?).

Waiting for the trade engines to crash and panic set in.

How about another hint?

Yeah,  I have to agree.  Besides, you gotta cash your paychecks somewhere so you need a bank....

I'd be careful.  I shudder at the thought of Windows users getting into bitcoin.  Then you're talking about linux.  Booting off a thumb drive.  Paper wallets.  They have to give their info to coinbase, etc.  Messing with other peoples money(and identity) is always a shitty box to open.
Maybe hook 'em up with paper wallets.  Later on they can say they wish they bought more but it is WAY too much for most people to wrap their heads around at this time.

Your questions will have you removed from the circle jerk.
And yes, I can watch bitlisten all day.

You'll likely get it back before summer ends.  You were speculating.....lessons later in life are far more costly.
Chill out and enjoy the summer.

What operating system?  Please say Windows.
Do you use a phone wallet?  Lotta apps?
Google 2FA?

Looked on blockchain.  The transactions were on 8-19 &amp; 8-20. If those were his addresses, maybe he did het fucked.

I'm just a long term holder now.  I'd be better off if I just held onto what I bought after the big crash.  I was buying at 70 and selling at 75, etc......sounds dumb now.  I'm all about dollar cost averaging now.  Wish I went in big earlier rather than hemming and hawwing.
