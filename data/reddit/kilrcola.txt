So passive aggressive. I wouldn't want to mess with you in a dark back alley.

As I am at work, I will respond briefly in a clear and concise manner. I have read a great deal on this subject and there is obviously bias on both sides of the fence. I am currently Switzerland and trying to remain pragmatic in my approach whilst filtering out the BS.
After watching the debate between Roger Ver and Richard Heart; I felt they agree on certain topics and without attacking either guy ad hominem I feel their debate answered a lot of questions regarding this. However this is my take, and my take only. I need not influence anyone, as you can make up your own minds.
I am pro BCH because:
*Low Transaction Fees
*8mb Blocks fixes the 'current' issues with Bitcoins full blocks.
I am pro BTC because:
*I believe in a free market, without the need of Governments telling us what to do with our money.
*I beleive there should be a currency on the internet where we can spend our money unfiltered and with minimal transaction fees.
That being said, I dislike what Bitcoin has become. Big banks have now invested with Blockchain and LN; are now supplementary layers that are being sold to us as a way forward, but in reality they are a way of adding extra payments to a system that wasn't envisioned in this direction. I am referring to Satoshi's White Paper.
If you think High Fee's are a good thing for bitcoin, I disagree. I see it as those in power got greedy and are now turning into making more money for themselves. This is never what it was about. 
BCH gives me new lease on life for cryptocurrencies, I am also invested in other altcoins too, but let me be clear, without legacy Bitcoin all other cryptocurrencies will not survive, as if it were to crash, every day people would get scared and not use it.
Here is the debate for those that are interested.

I can pay all my bills. Thats all i need.

Censorship in general is a terrible idea.

Meanwhile there is 60k transactions queued in your memepool

I guess the thing is to look objectively at the situation. There seems to be a lot of this back and forth. You can make an argument based on facts without ad hominem. 
Care to share the exact reason for the banning? They dont give out bannings for no reason OP. 
I am all for free speech but spreading FUD goes both ways and im seeing a great deal on both sides.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:22:35
You still haven't provided me a reason as to your banning. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:34:31
Ad hominem. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:21:33
You knew exactly what i meant. But yes BCH

This seems like a nice way to control what people see by putting it into one single post but hey. North Korea.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:09:48
Which kind of defeats the purposes of having it. What are the use cases if you cant use it? ��
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:36:00
I dont hate on bitcoin. I think its a great idea. I just think bitcoin cash is v2.0
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:24:27
Early days grasshopper. Might I remind you that the split was less than a month ago and follow up with. How long did BTC take to get its legs?
I am pro BTC and pro BCC.
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:05:09
Replace 'shills and paid trolls' with concerned owners of btc that realise that the chain is outdated and critically flawed. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:56:43
I had a guy at work offer me to come to a seminar on this. A simple google told me its a ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:55:19
and 3 more in the next 15 minutes. It should be 7.5 blocks per hour at this current rate.. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:35:08
Nothing wrong with that. A little hard for me to compare a currency which has market share right now, to one in its infancy but still has use cases and room to breath in regard to transactions per block.. but hey. Stick with what you know.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:03:19
Who are you validating? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:23:47
That makes no sense at all. Tell me when you purchase something. Do you purchase for $20 plus a 5 dollar transaction fee or use a network which charges 5 cents. I know which ill choose.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:01:10
I guess that makes sense to make your argument fit. Why wait 1 day when you can wait less than a few minutes for a transaction to clear. Tell me what is better?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:08:09
Says crying.. but in reality is shit posting. Nice one mate. Showing real maturity. 
You dont see me coming into here and shitposting because i know that for the greater good of crypto we all need bitcoin to survive.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:19:45
What if this is just a test to see what happens..
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:37:01
Neither. Just uninformed. What do i call it? 
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:46:36
Ok, so the main issue for most people is it is a hard fork, not a soft fork?
