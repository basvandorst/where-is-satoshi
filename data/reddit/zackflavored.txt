Airbitz all the way
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:40:22
No...this is referring to the jihan/ver circus saying that blockstream are paid shills to push the core agenda and the high fees benefit core and core is causing the high transaction fees because of not pushing bigger blocks when it is the miners who benefit from it.

@_date: 2016-12-30 02:35:12
Think of it this way.  My mode of thought is, if I expect it to become $2000 eventually (which I personally believe to be true as well), then buying it now or later, will not matter, you will see a gain/return eventually if you buy now at $1000.  I never take too much thought into the price if I am planning to HODL.  I kick myself for not buying at $700's, but still buy now.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:18:44
I think youre missing the point, hes saying that fees are going to miners not blockstream, which is absolutely true.

Wish this would get more exposure or understanding.  Bitcoin is technically whatever you want it to be.  Its applications are boundless and not limited to anything but the software.  So when people tell me its not worth anything or won’t amount to anything, that’s totally fine, but it doesn’t mean that it eliminates the value for other people.  Its literally digital monopoly money or gold or immutable math.
@_date: 2016-11-04 19:31:40

Yeah think about how well you would do with networking integrated into your self-reliance. As someone who thought the same as you, networking makes all the difference.  Ask the most successful people.  Sometimes you cant build bridges alone.  
Think about bitcoin without our network of deva and github, btc would be fraction of how amazing it is.  Whatever my words probs lost on deaf ears.  Good luck
@_date: 2019-02-24 17:25:04

@_date: 2019-02-23 19:05:14
Not to mention the way you talk about “ connections gets them nice gigs”shows me you know little to nothing about networking.  That is literally networking.  Go to an event/school/party/social gathering, make yourself known and meet great smart people and get something out of it for yourself.  Yes that will make your life better, making good connections.  If you look down on networking/connections i feel bad for you.

If you think the rich and famous get into Harvard then you literally have no idea how good of an actual school Harvard is.  Rich people want to get their kids into Harvard sure but i recommend you check the qualifications of what it takes to get into Harvard.  
Your life will be better if you realize that your associations hold no weight, just because someones from Harvard or Fidelity or somewhere probably doesnt mean theyre elitist.  It probably means theyre smart as hell and you would be better off learning from things like that rather than dismissing them.  You can do whatever you want though its your life.

Honestly, its people not seeing the value and doing their research.  Yes it will be skewed but it will be skewed to those who dont have an open mind and can see the potential.  Bitcoin is a household name for sure at this point.
This is just how it is, you could have capitalized on the internet could you have not have? somehow if you knew the information you knew now about the internet.
Its the same thing, the internet is a utility for humanity but of course there are people out there without it.  Bitcoin will be out there and available for all but not all people will be able to use it.  Its a skewed system but those who can use or appreciate bitcoin should.

You know what.  What the fuck, I don't really care cause you're technically right and I'll go along with it. 
Still not backing down that it is the best store of value the world has ever seen.  Whether it's hypothetical or not at this point because of the "demand" or stability.
Can't be stolen or confiscated (technically).  An extremely liquid asset that can be transferred anywhere anytime. Limited amount with scarcity.  Throw on being able to program it if necessary to whatever we can imagine, whether on the first or second layer.
You tell me what else can do that.

Liquid means something a little bit different than what you think.  It has nothing to do with price or volatility.
So yes there can be and have been countless forks (see how well that's turned out for the forks) - the best developers generally will stay with the crypto that has the strongest network, least centralized and best protocol.  Hence BTC. The limit can also be increased but bitcoin has obviously been built to be resistant to those kinds of changes.
Yes absolutely people could decide that the OG version didnt give enough people a fair chance to mine but it did.  And no reiteration will give anyone a "fair chance to mine".  Bitcoin did everything in an organic matter while everything else has a person or company behind it.  Making all other coins WAY more centralized than bitcoin ever will be.
And as you say - the network of miners behind it would have to go to this "new bitcoin" would they really want their hash power going to it?  Look up Segwit2X and if you already have then you should know what happened.
You want to treat it as insurance, go ahead, I like to look at the facts and history.
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:21:55

@_date: 2018-11-24 01:57:57
So there are plenty of exchanges that are willing to accept bitcoin - its pretty fucking liquid.  Minimal loss of value is not what makes things liquid so dont start that shit.
Yeah people arent supposed to ever hear of bitcoin let alone crypto - this is just how the world works.  its going to be one of the biggest redistributions in wealth, just like with any new tech (email, internet, whatever) people who catch on quicker get a bigger share of the cake.  People who don't want to catch up on good, sound money can be left in the dust.  
So by your argument, people would want to be part of some "equal" mining thing (i dont even know what the fuck youre imagining).  A "new start" to allow a wider distribution - rofl - i can't even imagine what kind of shitstorm that would be, this isnt kindergarten, life aint fair but it moves on with good tech.  I'm just not sure you understand how difficult it would be to start a "new" bitcoin - please look at coinmarketcap.com and look at ALL the thousands of alts that have died off.  
And then miners would go wherever profitable, youre right.  That's what makes crypto so good.  And smart miners - as they do - will do their research on what is most profitable.  And people who have a stake in BCH or ETH will mine that and so on.
Finally - bitcoin isnt even a decade old.  It literally has no track record but thats the fantastic part about it - people who realize how GAME CHANGING this invention/technology is - doesnt need to speculate worth a damn.  It is by far something that we have NEVER encountered before but those with a vision and can see globally and can see how many countries/PEOPLE NEED this in their lives - can predict (not saying im correct) the direction this exciting new form of money is taking.  
Don't be bother answering im done, i wont reply, was fun talking to you.

So lightning network is an additional network layer that utilizes the bitcoin network. There are no two tokens as it uses bitcoin for transactions but essentially you have to fund the lightning network with real btc before you can utilize it.  But by opening a channel and funding it, you can transact with anyone on the LN.  It is not possible to withdraw to bitcoin from the app at this time so I recommend only putting in small amounts.
Here is a video for dummies :) Probably can explain it better than me but this is my first time using LN as well.
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:57:58
Definitely great that you are excited about helping out the bitcoin community, but 2 things.
1. Bitcoin core isnt really in charge or making any huge strides for lightning network
2. Bitcoin core is never really trying to put out stuff as soon as possible so that they can “compete” with other coins.  They are trying to make the best possible solutions for bitcoin and are willing to make sacrifices such as speed for it, please dont rush people who are doing amazing things and for free nonetheless.
If you believe in Bitcoin and understand why it is so great, you wont worry about other coins.  Once you grasp that bitcoin is fundamentally better, its not a race at all.  Not that you shouldnt care about the price, but if youre worried of the competition because the price will drop, then you might as well go with alt coins.

It is a TAD bit different.  Not as simple as send and receive to a wallet address but you create an invoice to receive/send.  It's not the exact same but worth checking out!

Please elaborate on how POS is the only viable consensus mechanism then please tie it into decentralization.  Thank you.  If you dont reply I will just assume you dont know what youre talking about.

Don't listen to him, volcano insurance isn't the best store of value this world has ever seen that has deflationary traits.
But still don't spend more than you can afford.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:41:08
I mean, I fucking hate BCH but hes literally selling it as Bitcoin Cash now and just having it first.  Fuck him but he's not exactly scamming.  I mean by labeling BTC as Core, maybe.

This seems fake and dumb sorry.  First, why reveal your net worth online.  Secondly, why cash out ALL of it if you love the community and btc so much?  You can do half or even less if you want.  
This post is weird all around, not sure if looking for attention or what.
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:50:51
Oh there you go good sir, since you seem like you don't.
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved. More generally, a store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future.
I think you're confusing volatility with store of value.  Just clearing that up for you.

Pineapple fund is/was already doing this.  And adoption doesnt mean price hikes.
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:47:54
 Np, now go see the places that accept LN :) 
I personally went to try out slots and doubled by money :) $0.02 only lol but it was fun winning and cashing out instantly back into my wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:47:30
What was it supporting before? (Too lazy to check sorry)
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:50:27
Im so glad that good actors like Nicholas are in the btc space.  Makes me hopeful, propee open source stuff always wins.

I really might consider going the Raspberry Pi route someday soon, thanks! :)
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:56:12
Yes, you don't connect to your own node etc. with BlueWallet but it does show how accessible it is right now.  Just put in $40 earlier to try to mess around with LN and then decided to see if I could grab my tips from before.  
Once your wallet is set up, you just have to click "Receive" create an invoice, copy the invoice code to your clipboard and send !withdraw &lt;invoice number&gt; to lntipbot in a PM.  INSTANTLY received my tips.  So goddamn fast and intuitive once I messed around with it, furthering my excitement for bitcoin :)  Thanks u/MakeTotalDestr0i and u/jeffjefferson3000 for the tips to make me try it out!

You create a wallet and accept bitcoin.

It makes 100% sense.

Sorry to break it to you but this been going on for freakin years.
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:48:00
As much as I love Bitcoin, it's not one of those things I would rep on my computer.
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:57:51
For example, I didn't have any balance to pay your tip, so I funded the invoice that the tipbot gave me.  Now all you have to do is withdraw it :) I even recorded my deposit for your convenience.
@_date: 2019-01-26 01:00:37
Click send first and then type 
Edit i mean click marketplace in between the wallets and transactions
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:12:03
This is either a great joke or a sad person.
@_date: 2019-01-24 21:38:26
Bitcoin is bitcoin.  People can choose do use it how they like in the FREE MARKET.  It is sound money, doesnt mean that people have to follow the white paper to a T.  What you quoted there is already achieved.  
Sometimes these things are what is needed to grow.  Lax up.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:35:49
I second Edge.  Theyre from the makers of Airbitz and although its not as fleshed out its probably going to be developed very well in the future as itll slowlg receive what airbitz had in the past
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:09:04
Thanks bud!
@_date: 2019-01-07 21:43:35
are sending something like !withdraw lnbc01gvioejg98v0rwev(etc)- something like that? to the bot?  You should have created an invoice  in BlueWallet

@_date: 2019-01-24 21:34:35
Think about what youre saying.  It is in the eye of the beholder.  So which bank is best to create this coin you speak of?  Chase? Deutsche? Bank of America? Bank of Japan?  
Or would a coin that has no central authority that no one has to trust because its mathematically-secured, not by any one organization would you be willing to stand behind because it doesnt discriminate.  
You need to break out of your set world views.
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:49:15
I'm not 100% as I haven't tested it yet :( But I don't believe so?  Worth testing out!

Do your research on what btc does
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:24:26
No one knows why the price drops exactly but a lot of the hash power went to the BCH forks so there were some concerns for Bitcoin, I'm sure.  Selling doesn't exactly have to be the reason the price tanks, peoples belief in BTC can affect it too (which yes causes a lot more people to sell).
I mean, people might have sold BTC for the BCH so they could take advantage of the forks as well.  Who knows, but you get the general idea.
@_date: 2018-11-10 20:26:50
Holy crap i would love this if youre still offering, id be willing to drive wherever

Hey guys the price is going to go up or down btw.  Just in case y’all werent sure!

Its not that small of a community.  And also you got a cool story bro cause youre just tooting your own horn for buying some bitcoin and accidentally doing it twice.  Its really not particularly interesting, but still good on you.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:43:20
I dont think bitcoin itself can “sponsor” sports, they may be promoting or showing love for bitcoin though.

Yeah I echo the comments in this thread.  You lookin for a cure-all bud?  Cool go make that happen.  BTC is still better than so much already.
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:11:35
Nah man, Craig Wright just wanted to go learn more about fraudulent activities, so he stopped developing bitcoin.

Doing math and thinking about bitcoin all the time is going to drive you crazy.  If you want to have a less stressful life, buy, hodl and don't think about it for a while.  If you believe in bitcoin, the price will go up eventually.  Especially at halvenings..
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:55:09
Go buy bitcoin cash, youre more than welcome to.  Even if bitcoin cash became $8000 and BTC became $1500 i would still stay with bitcoin. (Core btw because you might be confused)
@_date: 2019-09-09 22:47:23
Don't listen to the people here, yes you should probably use a hardware wallet.  However, Wasabi Wallet is a fantastic choice.

Do you understand the principles of bitcoin and how it functions?  Its extremely hard to push for innovation at this point, by the consensus needed not to mention the support from miners.

Lmao if thats what the article is about fuck that and fuck you OP
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:26:40
Not to mention, yeah lets not let BTC actually mature and be adopted, we can just jump to "there is no hope for decentralized world ever" already.
Not like BTC will be spread out more evenly as life goes on and people time preferences change.

I don't know why you're getting downvoted.  Shit is the absolute truth.  Bitcoin is fucking awesome but without proper change in our lifetime, Bitcoin will be meaningless in most real world cases.
