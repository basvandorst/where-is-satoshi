You are bragging about buying a lambo due to your belief that Bitcoin will increase it's value in fiat. Lol
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:17:51
Lol. "In the future....."
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:47:11
Using Bitcoin does not inflate it's value. Trying to convince people it is worth millions in an attempt to benefit yourself financially makes your trust factor less than 0. That's the point I was making. No shot the person the OP is talking about says Bitcoin is great. He is fincially invested in it. That makes his opinion self serving and biased
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:47:28
Bitcoin has no value outside of converting it to dollars. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:33:11
And I'm sure you're not extolling the virtues of Bitcoin cause it would financially benefit you. Lol. 
"Hey guys if we all tell everyone how great this is and they believe is we can  all make free money!! What can go wrong?"
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:02:33
Bitcoin isnt a currency. What a joke. It lost any claims to be an "alternative to fiat" when everyone extolled it's virtue in going up in value as measured in fiat dollars.
"Hey man, fuck dollars, buy Bitcoin!"
"Cause you can sell it later and have more dollars!!"
@_date: 2018-05-30 02:06:45
Keep dreaming
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:06:23
Lambos are not priced in Bitcoin. Almost nothing is. The only way to buy anything with Bitcoin is to sell it for fiat. Which means Bitcoin isnt a currency. It's a collectible
@_date: 2018-05-29 20:09:29
And there a no way he's saying that cause he has significant assets tied up in Bitcoin. Honestly! The fact a higher price for Bitcoin would result in a direct financial benefit for him has NOTHING  to do with his endorsement of it!!
Lol.

And if fiat goes belly up what will your Bitcoin be worth? Zero. If global economies collapse no one is going to have a laptop and internet connection to use fucking Bitcoin. They'll be trading toilet paper and shotgun shells.
Bitcoin nutters are the weirdest cross breed of oreppers and goldtards I've ever run into
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:38:04
Right. If Bitcoin goes to it's true value of zero, he is out of business. 
He's a tire salesman telling people to buy cars. Not exactly an unbiased source
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:56:06
It wasn't a speculation. It was/is a huge pump and dump scam where institutional fraudsters used the stories of the few who made millions to fleece everyone else into making the fraudsters billions
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:21:48
That's a bad thing. Economies prosper via trade. In a fixed supply system, you get trade imbalancea that leave customers unable to buy goods since the seller has all the currency. When one side had all the Bitcoin, who can the sell to? No one.
This was figured out many many years ago and is why no one is on the gold standard anymore. Fixed amount of currencies would drive most of the world to poverty and starvation as counties got poorer and poorer and the available currency concentrated to a selct few at the top. The wealthy get all the weak and everyone else starves.

Real estate has value, you can live in it. Equities and bonds pay interest/dividends, so create economic value. Commodities are used to manufacture goods. Cash can be used as a medium of exchange guaranteed by the government to be accepted, and so has value. Currencies also pay interest. 
Every single thing you listed has economic value. Bitcoin just ... kinda sits there? The only "value" bitcoin has is when it's sold for a useful currency. 


Bitcoin isn't great for saving. LOL. Yeah, I'm going to put my savings in a vehicle thats down 70% in 6 months. Great plan!!
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:39:06
Sure he does. If Bitcoin drops to zero, he makes no money. He is financially incentivized to keep Hawking Bitcoin so people treat it. 
He's a pepperoni salesman telling everyone to eat pizza. Not exactly an unbiased source of information. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:03:41


You are wrong. Mindshare matters. Ultimately things only have value because we as humans ascribe value to them. 
You are stuck in the "rational" model of economics which has been proven false time and time again. Behavioral economic has supplanted it at every level. There's a reason it's a Nobel prize winning theory. 


Haha. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:25:51
You have it exactly backwards. You are espoauing economic theories that were examined and throughly rejected and replaced over the last 40 years. It's the economic equivalent of being a flat Earth or anti vaxxer
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:20:04
No it doesn't. I can declare canned peas a currency, go out any buy all the canned peas I want, and am not any more free. Declaring Bitcoin a currency hasn't made it a currency. 
It was something institutional frausaysrs lept on and used FOMO to defraud people. Sorry you fell for it. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:48:25
Lol. Sure thing. Never argue with a True Believer 
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:27:56
Wait a minute, you're telling me someone who has a financial interest in Bitcoin going up in value is predicting it will go up in value and telling people to buy it? Shocker! What incredibly unbiased advice!
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:20:33
And with global economies collapsed, no functioning government, no utilities, services, or law enforcement, how valuable will your BTC be?
"Yeah, well, we got no power, no heat, running low on potable water and food, and are stockpiling our ammo to fend off the roving gangs of desperate people trying to take whatever they can to survive, how many Satoshi's will this transfer be?
If fiat currency collapses the only thing your laptop with your Bitcoin will be good for is throwing it at someone
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:54:19
Lol. And since then those Bitcoins have lost over a million dollars in value. What a deal!!!
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:57:38


That makes zero sense. The existence of a currency does not guarantee anyone financial freedom. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:05:03
And at current rates those transferred fund are worth over a million dollars less then they were when sent. Take THAT fiat currency!!
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:54:19
The only reason bitcoin ever had value was because people were able to make USD off trading it. It never had any value as a "currency"
It cracks me up to hear people say I should buy bitcoin cause it is the money of the future, and because they make so much USD off it. If bitcoin is going to replace USD, why do I can about how much USD I can get for it? Why would anyone ever sell?
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:18:20
Funny I just bought my lunch with fiat. Which makes it infintly more caliabks than Bitcoin
