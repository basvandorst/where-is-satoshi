You seem to have a lot of anger built up. You shouldn't take it out world just because of mistakes that you've made. 
I replied to prove you wrong. You troll the internet with negative energy. I suggest you do some research instead of pretending you know the technicals.
Hopefully you figure yourself out and find peace.

Look at his other videos, makeup tutorials. He's clearly not intending to inform his audience, he's just trying to make a quick buck.

Here's another thought -
The 2% that they have insured, do you do they are valued at the current market? Or is it a fixed number? Would be interested in find this out.

Wake me up when it's over
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:02:52
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured"
"Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage."
Offline storage is NOT insured by shit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:41:54
Don't listen to this dude. He's giving out blatantly incorrect information.
@ 4:00 - He claims coinbase insures your crypto assets up to 250k. Coinbase only insures your USD in your USD wallet NOT your crypto assets.

This is the end boys. Good knowing yall
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:10:48
What did I just watch?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:16:53
"if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
  
It doesn't say anything about offline storage.
  
Your only implying that physical security is cold storage - it doesn't state that anywhere in their statement.  
  
Do you actually feel safe keeping your $ knowing that can be hacked and you will lose it all?

im gonna throw up

And we should listen to you because you know how to operate the paint application....?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:59:14
lmao. this is was on point
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:18:23
I agree with this. The private company that I work at has been trading it for a while now.

The patriot Act enforces companies to Know Your Customer. This law was put into affect after 9/11 to prevent terrorism.

A one hour spike isn't going to do it. Just look at the volume over 24hrs, you'll see it's relatively low.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:07:39
Go to TradingView website, create a login, type in BTC/USD, and then finally type in Volume under indicators. You'll see what I mean
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:54:44
got 'em
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:27:31
There's no volume. The move up was because of a thin order book. It's coming back down, we're still in a bear market.
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:32:55
I can confirm the same. No issues with PNC also. Maybe because my dollar amount deposits were under 10k
