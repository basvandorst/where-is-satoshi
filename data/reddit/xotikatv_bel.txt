No, not currently. However, you can the Xotika Telegram Chat Group, which has a bot that reports with a link, preview, and notification any time a channel goes live.
You can join here: 
We intend to have more notification options in the future!
@_date: 2017-02-18 08:21:41
We have recording capabilities (VOD) planned for a future update. Soon(tm)!

Well, I happen to think efforts to improve Bitcoin governance are silly and merely a desire of those that wish to bend Bitcoin to their will.

You can join our group in Telegram chat, where we have a bot that reports every time a channel goes live. Http://t.me/XotikaTV
Also, you can follow us on Twitter,  
We're working on adding more notification methods too!

CORRECTION The show will be an hour later than the original tweet, 8AM UTC, 3AM EST -- Sorrrrrry!

Thank you for all your coins. Also, from looking at your browser history, you've got some pretty odd fetishes yourself!
@_date: 2017-01-29 20:10:07
lol at the "guards", so ridiculous...
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:49:22
lol, there's no malware, we also don't have ads.

Xotika is actually a subsidiary of the CIA, whom pays all of ours, and Bitcoin Uncensored's salaries.
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:50:07
All of the coverage was recorded, and will be posted after Chris sorts out all the editing and rendering, etc
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:19:08
I totally agree, I was cringing.
@_date: 2017-01-19 14:51:44
It's quite suitable for OUR work, maybe you need a new job!
@_date: 2017-04-17 05:36:08
Xotika.tv accepts only Bitcoins and actually runs its own nodes. fwiw
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:54:45
The NSFW stuff is here:

Thanks for taking the time, but as the other commenter suggests, you have some things wrong, and in general are singing to the choir.
Xotika doesn't use Flash anywhere but in the live video player. The front end is written in AngularJS, utilizing CSS, etc. 
The color of the site is obviously something people will have subjective opinions on. Either way, the site is already being rebranded and your opinion will be taken into consideration. Eventually we'll have some default skins, etc too.
Actually most of the rest of your suggestions are already being addressed as we develop the 2.0 version of our platform. 
What you might not appreciate is that things take time and money. We are a small business competing and surviving in a market made up of whales. 
We are already aware of the needs you mention and working our way forward. 
In the meantime, relax and join our Telegram group if you want to stay up to date on our progress and be notified when shows go live! 
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:58:28
Go for it.
@_date: 2017-04-23 11:15:55
Ideas are cheap.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:07:50
Bad advice is bad.
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:10:05
How can we accept an agreement that doesn't include any research or reasoning? 
WHY do they insist on the hard fork? 
What do they hope to achieve with the fork?
Is there a target tx throughput? A target cost per tx?
Why should we accept arbitrary decisions by central actors?
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:03:55
Sorry! I was going from Chris' notes! 
@_date: 2017-05-03 19:21:50
It's an adult show, and while most of the nudity is male boobies, it does happen on occasion!
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:44:26
No, hard fork is off limits, particularly when it's entirely unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:40:51
We've been signaling Segwit for a while now, and one of our nodes is also signaling UASF.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:40:20
Won? Gimme a fukn break. Asking for passwords is outright absurd. Witchhunting for info is horrible in general.
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:02:56
No it's not news. It's a public ledger, of course they can track the coins...
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:27:20
I believe there's also a maximum % they will let something drop in one day.
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:30:19
It's not unheard of at all. For example, Bitfinex has a special bot/algo to handle large liquidations and cascades to mitigate their effect over time.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:59:16
Sigh... You don't need to be told, you can assume the coins are tracked, just like every other major hack or theft of coins. Mixing doesn't work on chain. However, knowing the destination does not mean they can retrieve them or stop them from being laundered off chain. It really isn't news.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:39:49
Why? Is it not interesting to know whether Bitcoiners are buying these things? I know I'm not...
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:27:58
All they said is that they know the destination, which means they tracked the coins in ledger and not much more.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:04:25
Some pro traders I know have observed it in action, but you'd have to ask bfx for confirmation or details, which they might not even wanna share.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:36:45
Your headline reads like the opposite of the highlighted text...
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:55:55
I was around when Luke was blacklisting. If I recall, it was mostly about stopping satoshi dice "spam". Not sure though...
