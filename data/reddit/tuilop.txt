Don't forget that bitcoin value is increasing. So even if it's not much, miners are receiving more  (in USD) because transactions fees are in a way  locked.

Amazon only wants profit. Making this kind of move is a nice try, it's not the first time some people will get fooled this way.

It is normal ! Of course they are making profits ! They would not be there if it wasn't the case...
But I think this kind of mesures is dishonest buisiness. People buy this credits and will have to spend them on their apps (just like gift cards) and will not be able to get them back if they don't use them (and in the law amazon will not have to, because it's not an actual currency).

Bitcoin art, nice ! Some of them are quite original.

I know I should buy some of it, but I don't do it. When I was younger I used to get money on the internet and buy some stuff with it (steam games, objects on ebay and other stuff). So Bitcoin is like another challenge to make money on the internet.
Anyway I am a bit positive by mining (Yesterday I used ~4,2 KW/h = 0.50$ and I made ~0.03 BTC = 0.60 $)

That's what Gpu miner were saying a few weeks ago, but if they kept mining they still would have won money because of the increased value of bitcoin. I am still mining with Gpu's (even at a little loss) because of two things:
1) It is fun !
2) Because I think these bitcoins will be much more valuable in the future. So I am not only thinking about their present-time value (which is quitte stupid and I'll tell you why after) but I think mostly about their potential value.
Why do I think it is stupid to think about the present value of bitcoins? Simple, when we mine it's a perfect example of a free market economy (every body produces the same thing [bitcoin], there are no entry fees so everybody is able to participate [you only need a Gpu], and the profit each miner will get is determined by the difficulty level (which [please correct me if I'm wrong] increses with the number of miners). So if we say that a miner only mines if he can get an immediate profit from it (which is quite logical amd it is the logic followed by many miners) the profiit everyone will get is just enough to pay the electricity and their graphic cards (because the market has too much supply [every person want to make money, and they will until there is no more money to make]). So unless there is someone with a substancial advantage (like the first Gpu miners, or the first asics now) no body will be able to do massive profits, but I think reasonable profits are still possible even with Gpu's now (just enough to pay your electrocity bill). I don't know if this model can be applied in a few months, because asics are not owned by everybody (unlike Gpus) plus they are quite expensive (not a pure free market economy anymore).
But the point is that the value of bitcoin is directly correlated with the price of mining them, so talking about their present value (it is what everyone does) is not a good logic because it does not take in account the future incresed difficulty of mining them. 
Sorry for the poor english, or the mistakes i could have done (i'm not a native speaker)
