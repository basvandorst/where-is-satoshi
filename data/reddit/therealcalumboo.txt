I'm sure you do!

Nah chance.

Where have you taken this data from? Which hours has it hit $5200?
Edit Ah sorry, AUS dollars. Like the other person said, we're on an upward slope for the long run. Get in. 
If you want it cheap as possible, you'll need need to micro manage, as in be checking every hour or less and looking at the trends.
I've got the feeling it will be coming down even moreso this morning, since last night (British time here). That's a feeling, no evidence.

I don't believe the QR scanner would accept the code if it couldn't read it correctly.
There is error correction features in QR codes as well, dependant on originally created code. More error correction will result in a larger code block. I.e. a QR code with big blocks does not have much error correction, opposed to a code with lots of small blocks, which has more error correction.
If that slab is from 7 years ago, when BitCoin was not as expensive, I'm guessing it's simply an issue code from a batch.
Depending on what it's made from, it's probably worth the same as or less than a BitCoin was worth in 2010?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:17:52


Same here. Bitcoins to the USD is up though ;P
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:18:42
:) It's part of my R&amp;D in BitCoin so its a win win!
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:56:56


If it's a 5 digit code, I can't see how that relates to anything BitCoin that could lead back to a public/private key or such.
All QR codes look the same, you could probably even generate that QR code online by sticking the same number in 'text' field.
I know this because I worked with QR codes when suddenly everyone  was using them for all sorts of things.
I believe they were invented for logistics, like packing where containers could be damaged through transportation. If you turn the QR code upside down, side ways, etc... you'll see it still reads the same string. Try it.
What I would do, is find out where the brick has come from and then you'll find your answer. I can't imagine many people creating these, especially back in 2010.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:26:27


Why not invest some of that in bitcoin then??
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:25:54
'Bosses' can be shitheads. They do realise that YOU make the money right. Hope you enjoy the ride!
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:10:53
How is it possible for them to take that much and use it yet not be traced?  There's only so much they can buy with BitCoin; surely they'd want to convert to fiat at some point.
The blockchain will show the wallet trail, which eventually (even after years) would end up at an exchange? 
Even if you sold it for cash, the BitCoin still needs to be transacted to other wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:22:11
Yes, tax.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:09:23
Looking at those blocks. They looked machined. I bet those codes read the same number out right? Doesn't make sense for someone to create them and change the digits by 1 each time. Just throw the block on and let the machine engrave.
I remember seeing something like these blocks on eBay awhile back.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:22:40
Fine fine. I've sent you a little!
I hope this gets you started off! 
Enjoy (
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:22:56
Sorry to hear that buddy. Know how it is.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:23:06
Have you got any at all?

What is it about BlockStream that has everyone in a fuss? Do they have a huge mining farm or hold a lot of coins?
Or is it that they apparently an employee that works on BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:20:41
Ah man! I'd say buy some BitCoin but that wouldn't be wise of me!
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:14:54


Haha! Deal!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:14:37


Maybe you could help buy one of these guys a coffee? Never know, could get a date (:
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:15:29


You're a live and breathing, it's nice that you get to feel shitty!
Seriously though, maybe next time!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:16:51
Wouldn't we all, guy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:08:44
Details please. You must.
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:09:59
Bawahahahahaahahah!! Excellent!
So I'm not the only person to have to clean that shit up!
Coffee coming your way...waiting for confirmations and it shall be sent! Open your windows too; you stink.

Where would one buy many bitcoins from a trusted exchange? CoinBase is very limited in how much you can buy.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:52:17


Sorry, which wallet are you talking about?
1. Register CoinBase.
2. CoinBase creates some BitCoin/LiteCoin/Etherium addresses (wallets), although I believe transfers (selling/buying coins) works internally off of the blockchain.
3. Provide ID (takes a few minutes to approve)
4. Provide Payment Details (Bank/Debit Card)
5. Make a payment from your payment card you added. Say £10.
6. £10 will appear in a 'wallet' named GBP, which basically represents your balance on BitCoin (there is EUR wallet too FYI).
7. Buy BitCoin using the GBP 'wallet'. 
8. GBP 'wallet' is reduced by £10 (with fees included).
9. BitCoins are transferred to your BitCoin wallet and balance updated.
If you want to sell. Simply sell from your BitCoin wallet, which then ends up in your GBP 'wallet' again... or transfer funds to your payment card.
Obviously, there are fees also involved in the process.
In regards to GDAX. If you are talking about transferring BitCoins from GDAX to CoinBase, you can send from one address to the BitCoin address in CoinBase. 
BitCoin does not allow sweeping or importing wallets but that's a different topic altogether regarding cold storage and hardware wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:11:17
I've used CoinBase with no problems. I've only had the account for approximately a month, however.
The only problem I had was before the $1400 dip, my ID was denied several times. After a few weeks, it was validated within minutes. I presume there were a lot of people trying to get in on BitCoin at that point.
I have carried out some research on them and in general, quite positive reviews on Reddit. You will be limited with debit-card, however; so you will need an international bank account to increase limits.
LocalBitcoins is good if you want to buy in person or even direct online, just be careful if you meet someone in person.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:11:05




lol! Excellent. Your name seems appropriate. Enjoy! (
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:08:02
From around 5AM this morning, the price has constantly dropped from $4.4k
At 4PM, it hit a low of $3.9k in that hour. The lowest within the hour was about $3.8k.
It's creeping up constantly now; with a lot of which I presume buying.
If anyone is thinking of buying, maybe now is a good time?
*Edit Every time is a good time.

Ya, my bad.

@_date: 2017-08-17 22:36:17


Lol! Why though?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:20:58
Ah ok. You got Fri, Sat, Sun! Plenty of time to relax.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:24:06
You sound like a suspiciously like a broker.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:29:21
Sent. Couldn't not do this one. Cheers buddy. I found that the confirmations are taking quite long, even at the wallets recommendation. I will be reviewing all of this along with some screenshots. I wish I could work out how long the confirmations took for each transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:16:42
I always found the opposite! Meetup coffees always seem nasty to me.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:04:36


Enjoy your coffee!
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:57:24
I'll have a read of this. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:19:13
Ahh! A picture may have swayed me!
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:31:37
Congrats dude! That's some life of luxary money at 25 right there. Stay humble.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:41:34
Yeah I get that. Not sure about lost coins though, as many have coins in long-term storage.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:36:39
My question should have been worded better but I was trying to get to; where is the demand actually coming from? Is it just more people are exchanging fiat for BitCoin or is this in addition to new coins being mined.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:24:19
Why's that then?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:17:30
Maybe next time buddy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:15:56
Yes, yes you are. Looooooong stretch! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 22:06:43
Poor boy! Coffee coming your wait. Waiting for confirmations to complete, then I'll send! Enjoy your days off.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:29:35
Go for it! I didn't buy at £500 / BitCoin. It's on the up and up, just look on the week on week trend. 
The only spanner in the works that I saw was the BitCoin split with BitCoin Cash. That's when it hit a low of £1400. I couldn't get in on time because I didn't register my account early enough.
If I would have invested before that, I could have sold the BitCoin Cash and bought more BitCoin.
The announcement of the Blockstream Satellite is good news (I can't confirm, however) too. Individuals and companies are putting major money into this. It's a good time to be starting BitCoin IMO.
Don't invest money you can't lose, although tempting. Just get in, even £10 and seeing it go up-to £15 will break your fear!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:24:56


LOL! Catch you next time. Just don't start with using the dollar bills.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:23:42
Can someone get an IRC server hosted up in that bitch!
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:18:11
Ah man! Maybe next time. You should buy 2 anyway :P
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:21:52
I've actually not even looked at GDAX but heard of it. I'll have a look later.
Yes, Visa Debit is fine. You will be severely limited to approx. £350 but that goes up within a month. The money will be taken from your account as GBP and not converted to Euro or anything like that; thus no currency conversion fees. It takes a few seconds and you'll have money deposited in your CoinBase GBP wallet where you can buy BitCoin, Etherium or LiteCoin.
It's pretty easy once your ID is verified.
The price is creeping up now, so if you're thinking of buying (whatever amount). Get in now maybe but it's your prerogative.
For anyone else thinking of joining up. Just get an account at least because some limits can only be increased by time!
