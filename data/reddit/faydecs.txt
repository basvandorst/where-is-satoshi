Getting there, but I still believe it will grow again. That’s why I bought more and am not panic selling

I suggest you setup a buy ad on localbitcoins, a lot of people are selling right now and that would allow you to buy bitcoins for below their value. I’m also from Canada and buy through etransfer.
I also suggest setting up an electrum wallet as it is very beginner friendly and easy to use.
If you need more help Dm me.

Electrum probably because you don’t need to download a copy of the entire blockchain and it is native to tails.
