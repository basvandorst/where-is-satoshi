I'm putting out this warning everywhere. The exchange in question, QuadrigaCX, is run by a known scammer who was convicted for fraud in the past, Michael Patryn aka Omar Dhanani.

That's what you seem to think but I'm not. I see you've been making new accounts bashing other exchanges hoping I'll take the bait. Sorry to disappoint you but I don't give a fuck. Bash anyone you want, you will not find me coming to their defense. The real issue I'd like to address is your ties with international criminal identity theft mobster Omar Dhanani 'Patryn'.

Oh so now you show up in the forums after more than a week of complete silence. Afraid people will know who you guys really are?? Patryn aka Omar Dhanani, Midas Gold owner and ponzi scammer?

Michael Patryn is one of the founders of Quadrigacx. He is part of a criminal mafia mob and has been to jail before for carding theft, ID theft and ponzi schemes. His real name is Omar Dhanani. Here's an article from coindesk that names Patryn as the cofounder of QuadrigaCx:
Omar Dhanani aka Michael Patryn was one of 6 men arrested for internet ID theft and credit card conspiracy fraud back in 2005. They were operating Shadowcrew.com, a web mob of highly organized criminals. For more info google ShadowCrew.
At the time ShadowCrew was busted by the US Secret Service Omar Dhanani was a resident of Fountain Valley, California. A search on Intelius lists Omar R. Dhanani from Fountain valley, CA along with his relatives, Nazmin Dhanani and Nabatbibi Dhanani.
Now here is where it gets interesting.  Nazmin Dhanini and Michael Patryn have apparently registered several companies together, one of them being MPD Advertising:
Omar Dhanini relatives: Nazmin Dhanani and Nabatbibi Dhanani
Michael Patryn: registered at least one company, MPD Advertising Inc with Nazmin Dhanini.

Why do you PM me? *This* is my issue - your link to ID theft criminals and the fact that one of your cofounders did jail time for carding fraud. You need to address this publicly, not by PM'ing me.

The comments on your Facebook page seem to contradict that. So many complaints about lack of response:
