Please don't try. There is always something to live for. Hang on :)

Which weren't actually a time period. That's an anachronistic name for the early middle ages. And anyway, science DID advance through the early middle ages. Improved building techniques, crop cycling etc

Poor old Cliff, he's been running from that quote for a long time. He's a terrific guy, and it's well worth reading his book 'The Cuckoo's Egg', had to read it for my Comp Security class several years ago and I loved it. Incidentally I was the only one who read the book as part of the assignment in my class, and got an HD, remember kids: do your assignments!

Someone buys the risk. New people will buy your sold B2X coins. They have in effect bought your risk about the certainty of the chain.

Average is about $58,000 according to [here](
That doesn't include government payments, so prolly somewhere in the region of $40-50,000.

Gotta say, I've always thought that this sort of stuff is key to getting a lot of people to understand Bitcoin. They don't have to use it, but to understand that it's not magic internet money for drugs.
I'm actually setting up a website right now trying to explain bitcoin to everyday people. Stories like this would be excellent for it :)

Okay. Now what does that mean in English?

Page 3.
"To format the footnote, use
initials for the author’s given names and write his last name in full; optionally list degrees held
by the author, separated by a *common* "; 
Should read: comma
First noted on page 3, and then used throughout the manuscript.
"Appendixes—Relegate to an appendix material that would distract from the flow of the
article, but that is required to rigorously prove claims made or concepts introduced in the
paper’s body"
*Appendixes* should read Appendices, as correct plural of Appendix.

Word for word my story. Even the programming stuff. Weird :)

Also the phrase, "literally every major bank" is hyperbolic. Consider stating, many major banks instead..
@_date: 2015-09-30 02:59:38
You cross just slightly into hyperbole at the end there, but generally very nice to read!

FYI though, a 220% increase does not make 455 PH/s into 1 EH/s. It would instead be ~122%

Would making characters yellow in the style of The Simpsons be considered IP infringement?

I believe that ELI5 is more Explain Like I'm Not Well-Versed In This Topic Whatsoever (ELINWVITW doesn't sound as catchy though)
It's more that we're trying to move hard concepts into more digestible and relatable concepts. Most ELI5s still use words a 5 y.o couldn't understand.
@_date: 2015-09-17 18:25:17
Lol that's not how percentage increases work. What you mean is 2.2 times increase. 220% implies over a tripling. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 09:46:21
I agree, but it has stuck like mud.. It's not going away in a hurry, but I guess that is part of the deal..
@_date: 2015-09-03 23:43:39
Excellent ELI5. If you wrote this, well done!

Technically alt coins don't share the common blockchain ancestry. They typically mine their own genesis block. I get what you mean though.

Thank goodness, I only found Bitcoin in Jan 2014. I felt late to the party :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 00:48:17
Haha, at this point, it gets very vague and non standard in terms of definitions 
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:16:43
There is a typo on the main page:  
**printint it out**  
Second paragraph of the paper wallets section.

Gotta get someone to do that for you, unless you are game with a tattoo needle.

I thoyght that the whole point of the coins being conctracted into a lightning channel was that once you have staked the coins, you can't have them taken unless you sign the tx. If you don't sign, you get them refunded back to your address?

I've had the same problem with MultiBit losing track of my wallet. I just backed up the key, and did a restore. Hopefully that works for you too.  
And if that is your address, your BTC is still there, you just need to get MultiBit to like your private key again. You can try using a different wallet to see if that helps as well, using a restore from private key or BIP38 seeds.

Popular is different from having a large market cap, which is what the site ranks by.
