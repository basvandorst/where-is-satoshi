not done yet. Will test it again...
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:44:31
its called shorting it. You sell, wait for it to dip more and rebuy, saving you the loss and picking up more BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:55:13

@_date: 2019-07-02 04:11:32
Bitcoin's going to hurt its nose if it keeps diving like this.
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:03:49
Yes. More than likely.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:53:43

@_date: 2019-07-11 05:17:38

@_date: 2019-07-14 22:00:04
No just smart. Short it and take up more BTC on the way down.
@_date: 2019-07-02 12:37:59

@_date: 2019-07-01 01:18:15

@_date: 2019-07-21 02:28:53
Back down to at least 9k in the next couple of days. Mark my words.

About to have major correction
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:04:53
lol at anyone "buying the dip" then "buying the dip" then "buying the dip", losing every time.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:27:32
No wait. The next couple hours are critical we could go down fast.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:11:06
Dropping down to 9-10k. No worries.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:36:47
HERE COMES THE DIP!!!! SELLLLLLLL!
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:36:39
you might be onto something there...
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:56:45
I tried it for gmail and it worked.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:52:15
Here we go down the slope, again.
Can't we all just agree that we could hit \~9.5k before going up again to 15k? All indicators do clearly suggest that.  Just let it do it's thing.  Short it if you're brave.  In the long run it will not matter. :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:16:32
you waited this long and you want to leave now?! When you're at the brink of a fortune in 1 month!?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:27:36
Binance is down thats why
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:55:47
I think you are a true pessimist.  Are you just salty you didn't buy at the bottom like a lot of us did? Dont worry you can still buy.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:28:17
its already starting to go back up. stop spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:23:10
It was a problem with my phone
