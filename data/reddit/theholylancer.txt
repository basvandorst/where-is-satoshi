hmm thanks, i know that if I ever install one I need to keep an eye for it, but it seems that bitcoin miner based virus seems to be a bit more craft than the normal stuff.
if it wasn't for the fact that the fans on this clevo is loud i may have not caught it at all, since the CPU usage even when I saw it with speedfan was like 50% of one core out of 8 
Honestly, I wish that the spec for bitcoin mining specified ports, so that its reputation is more legit than something that could be used for immediate malware builder benefit (compared to hostageware or CC/cred farm) and almost untraceable due to its nature.

but unlike a work machine, it won't have the latest copy of xyz
for example, bioshock infinite would not be on here, and even if steam took care of it, it is still an hour of download at best...
i could have say office, firefox, vlc, some other tools installed in the image, but the other stuff is not exactly imageable, esp thing like eve online and league of legeneds, where an old version takes just as long to update to current as if you just had redownloaded the damned client from % via their website.

well at this point, it seems that is the way to go, the sopheciation of these bitcoin related bugs are a lot more than the normal ones that I am used to dealing with (IE the bit that it sees that resource / task manger is on and shuts it self off).
guess I should speed up my SSD upgrade process and get a new ssd and wipe the W7 off.
well, nowadays its a lot easier for me to afford eve or other things, and the damage to my rep if I ever do something like this in my company is not worth it at all...

hmm okay
thanks for the heads up.
i wonder how long before a common bitcoin miner that could be run without install and be propgated easily and is hard to detect is built and infests a HS's computer lab
thats what I would try to do rofl then maybe i could afford eve online a lot earlier ha

Its my personal W7 install, that would mean many hours of work (even with steam doing all the heavy lifting...), I am just looking for a simpler way, I know how to remove it, but doing a system scan every-time I feel that something is off is not my thing.
If this was a work machine that can be reimaged in a jiffy, I would not be here.

same here, but i keep my enviroments jailed on VMs, a ubuntu VM for development work
I just wish that VMing could be 1 to 1ed with gfx one day, so then I can use linux as base, but have a windows VM that could "take over" when I want to tgame.

unless you don't play video games, its MS or Mac, and I refuse apple
