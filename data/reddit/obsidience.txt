So I checked with my Chinese friends and they say this is absolutely legit.  They're in the process of patenting some new process called FermentationBoost that not only yields more beer but also dilutes the beer of all of their competitors.

Beerchain is a great idea but unfortunately I don't know how to code.  I just sell memory, video cards and shill tweets from time to time.

What if I told you that the free market is a system, not a single actor?

* Dogecoin has been gaining value compared to BTC in the last few weeks.
* Doge has 1 minute blocks vs 10 minute blocks which adds more capacity and allows for lower fees at the same block size as BTC.  It's like Bitchoin Cash but four years ago and using a faster block time rather than a larger block size...
* Doge has been around for quite some time and the community is still active...
* From what I hear, many people will convert some coin to Doge to move to another exchange because the market is liquid enough that large moves don't affect the price too much.
* Who doesn't love Shibas?

He's not licking crumbs, he's using raw tongue strength for extra hodling power.

You know, I've started to grow to this opinion that altcoins are basically side chains that help with scaling (using exchanges), but with atomic swap capabilities - it takes it to a whole 'nother level.
I wasn't aware that they would also have connected lightning networks.  I'm going to do some more research.  Thanks!

Awe, after all that hard work he gets hit by a bus at the end...

That make sense, thanks.

Like others have pointed out, Lightning transactions are indeed IOUs as in "This is a signed contract that the recipient can redeem in Bitcoin once broadcasted to the Bitcoin network".  There's nothing wrong with it being an IOU as long as there are no bugs in the design, implementation and usage of LN.  
So I think your post may be adding to the "uncertainty" and "doubt" aspects.

Large numbers should be expressed in something our little minds can understand: houses.  
Average American home price is around $200k.  That's ~355,000,000 houses worth of new debt in 11 years.

Wow so the price of Bitcoin has eyes and motives now.  
Good to know...  Good to know...
