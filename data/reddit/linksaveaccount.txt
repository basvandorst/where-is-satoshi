I did.  Looks flat this year.  Up from 2017.  Range is like 10 cents per ringgit over the last 20ish years.  Literally more stable than bitcoin

I'm going with an expert who has made a compelling statement based on facts that can be independently verified, vs a hasty generalization made by Anonymous guy on the internet. If you want to sit there and point out logical fallacies then you should understand when you yourself are employing them as well.  Please refer to the fallacy fallacy

Right and the added complexity that you're referring to is not the additional complexity I was referring to. Because your situation is a minority situation and not the actual intended goal of the OP or of the movement of Bitcoin in general.
Using Bitcoin everyday, or even semi frequently, add absolutely nothing but complexity.

Yeah I'm going to go ahead and say that the CEO of one of the largest investment companies on the planet is a better source of information than some random idiot on Reddit. Especially when she's actually using data to support her assertions and not tingly conspiracy feelies

There is literally no point to doing any of the things that you are thinking about doing. All it does is add more complexity to things that are super simple right now. Life is way simpler if you just don't try to use Bitcoin. Buy it, invest in it, whatever you want to call it. But the minute that you try to actually use it regularly in financial transactions throughout your daily life, you are making your life way more complicated and every transaction way more complicated, for absolutely no reason or benefit

Where's the paranoia coming from what is it that you think is going to happen if you just keep your money in a bank account
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:21:38
Just look at all of the extra s*** you are adding into your life for no reason at all

Why would you be looking over your shoulder or hiding your money? What exactly are you trying to obtain Peace of Mind from?
I interpreted your message as meaning that you are using Bitcoin and adding the complexity of using Bitcoin to avoid having to hide your money and look over your shoulder. Not following IRS guidelines in order to avoid those things. If you were referring to the IRS portion of that then you missed the entire point of my post. Which is to say that the usage of Bitcoin in Daily transactions add so much more complexity for absolutely no reason or benefit

Good Lord take it down a notch man. You're not sitting up on some pedestal high-and-mighty. You act like some know-it-all self-righteous jackass. And then you try to hide behind what you believed to be a proper interpretation of how to form arguments. And then you fail to actually do that.  
So because there have been, and in some cases still are, negative interest rates, you believe that that means that the system - the entire system - is on the verge of collapse? That's quite a leap. Especially when you consider that, for example, the United States had negative interest rates and no longer does because they served their purpose.
