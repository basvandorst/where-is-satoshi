You mean transaction?

Right on the peak before this crash several days ago.

I just know about Litecoin.
You forget bitcointree.net and getbitcoins.info.

On basic I only know that you need to queue the operations request and control the commit (DML) timing. Thanks for the explanation.

Btw you got pretty much there (0.000001). I was only getting 0.0000001.

Sure he means the listed sites, not yours.
I tried one or couple sites while procrastinating. I am using online wallet.

Is it real BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:27:09
Invest no money. Just collect some free uBTC and have fun tipping around among poor ones.

Not a hard BTC user (have less than 0.001 afterall) but save this for future on maybe other needs!

So it makes its way to gambling now? Hmmm
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:04:25
From that daily free BTC. Sometimes you are just bored on shift and do that. I only visit sites that request me nothing except entering cap with address and SFW. However it is still very risky.

Support this question, I want to know too. And how to trade it back to real currency?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:45:00
The farm or the site?
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:28:46
That's worthy for experiment.

I also don't think Google Docs came out on 4yo internet.
But beside that, I still get the point of this post.

Not a DB expert so I don't laugh.
Not user of the service too so I don't cry.
Poker face.
