With news of Korea accepting people to trade from the 30th, lightning network coming along nicely, segwit adoption at nearly 20% and low btc price right now, I think it’s the perfect time to get in as February is looking very promising! I’m excited!
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:46:18
Yep! Exactly how I predicted! We are seeing a backwards table pineapple ascending downward side to side bounce graph! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:42:39
Stay level headed, Monday will be a good day. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:41:58
At 100k people will ask why you were stupid enough to sell at 10k... 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:49:55
You’re absolutely right! We just smashed through the daily high. Lol go back into Hibernation
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:05:02
90% of people invest in shitty alt coins to make a quick buck and nothing more. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:14:24
Price will go up to ATH after the next expiry on the 26th then when the next contracts expire each month yes we probably will have a dump but the dump will be much higher to what it is now because bitcoin would have gone up a substantial amount between now and then if that makes sense. We’ll have a much higher low.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:03:24
Do people really think bitcoin will crash and everything will slowly die and phase out?? Wake up. Bitcoin is here to stay. Bitcoin will continue to rise. Relax, the next few months will be some of bitcoins best :) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:33:14
Everyone is so focused on the price. Take a step back. Look at the big picture. Seriously, do it. Bitcoin hasn’t even begun to crawl yet. Bitcoin is and will change the world. Believe in bitcoin, believe in the technological revolution it has started. Two years ago 90% of you wouldn’t have known what the word crypto currency even meant. This is still such an early stage. Bitcoin is here to stay, and once it grows we will all reap the benefits. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:54:03
I was under the impression the general consensus was that it was a good thing because it’ll stop a lot of manipulation?
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:15:30
Hold. February will be an absolute bull fest!
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:11:29
This is VERY good news for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:13:14
This is an example of why you should NEVER lose faith in bitcoin. +1100 up since the bottom about 4 hours ago. It may dip again but this just goes to show how quickly it can recover and everyone’s mindsets can change again. TO THE MOON. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:11:59
Another incredible prediction! 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:55:33
Yesterday showed us that no one can predict bitcoin. Get out if you’re scared, otherwise enjoy the incredible ride this coin will take you on! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:27:26
Hahaha it’s been like one month. This isn’t a get rich quick scheme. Relax, bitcoin will ALWAYS come out on top. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:24:37
Btc showing great signs when weekends are notoriously known for being days of big dips recently. We are coming out of the slump! Monday is liftoff

Feb will be the month of the bulls. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:12:30
People are scared. Dont stress, give it a few weeks and I promise you it’ll have reached a new ATH
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:03:46
Probably the last chance to buy such a good dip before we shoot off to the moon on Monday. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:13:57
Ofc no one can predict bitcoin. But a lot of FUD from the last few weeks is slowly dying off, as well as segwit adoption slowly creeping up, as well as the lightning network being tested and implemented across the board. All this combined with Korea allowing people to sign up to exchanges tomorrow and big new companies jumping on board bitcoin everyday. Given all this I see February being the month bitcoin goes on a bullrun! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:23:41
If you invested in this price two months ago you were in an area of massive profits. The same will happen again now. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 10:30:17
What is everyone worried about? If it shoots down to 8k the amount of people that’ll buy back in will propel btc into a massive bull run back up to 13 - 14k and beyond if it is sustained. This is a win win. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:30:27
Don’t worry guys, Monday will be a break upwards, into feb which will be a smooth run up to 25k. Trust me. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:25:44
Hold guys. This will separate weak hands from the rest of us. Feb is the month bitcoin will take a turn for the best. Trust me. Three weeks from now you’ll be kicking yourself if you sold. Bitcoin is about to take off again. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:19:30
$23,375 ath
@_date: 2018-01-27 05:46:47
If we have learnt anything it’s that bitcoin is unpredictable. Sure, be careful when you invest. But who’s saying the next spike won’t come tomorrow? Buy the dip is simply people having open minds about how fast the next spike will come.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:21:55
Lol, lightning network gaining traction, Segwit adoption improving, futures going bullish, robinhood opens btc trading BUT NO. Chinese New Year will dump this market. Hahaha
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:58:55
The last week our lows have constantly been tested and every single time we bounce back. It’s only a matter of time before bears realise they can’t short this LOL
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:14:53
Hahaha wait till feb 
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:38:11
The bull run that’s about to occur that will get bitcoin back in the spotlight again
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:54:36
Stop being spooked by all this FUD. The worst is over, we will not see a new low before a new ATH. Starting from Monday we’ll see a good run and early feb a new ATH
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:29:52
how can you increase your chances if nothing is certain?

@_date: 2018-05-24 08:54:01
I dont understand.. why would he not sell yet try and drive the price down? It makes sense if he was to short but youre saying he isnt?? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:18:37
I do know one thing though, bulls they come they go. Saturday through Sunday Monday, Monday through Sunday yo. Maybe I love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow, till then bitcoin just get yo drunk on the fucking 10k road. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 08:41:22
must feel bad to have shorted at 8.9k

honestly if you're buying in right now, you have balls of steel. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:23:33
6.7k bottom
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:22:27
It'll bounce because people are greedy. No one will let this hit 0 lol. There will be a point (my guess is around 5.5k) that a lot of people will start to buy back in and thus starting the hype of a bounce again. Of course it'll probably crash again after we bounce, but then we just rinse and repeat until the hype is so great it continues to climb. Thus starting the "mooning" hype again.
@_date: 2018-03-05 15:56:17
Chipping away at that 11.5k wall, it'll break on the next big push. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:49:31
most people on here are usually wrong. Thats why I think today we'll see a rise in price. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:44:36
6.5k is the buy in. Wait for it.
@_date: 2018-03-05 12:14:33
I'm actually in love with this slow and steady climb. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:02:16
why are people complaining hahahahah literally short and buy back in when its finished dipping and its easy profit. I love it when bitcoin does this.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:12:05
11.1k fomo will hit like a freight train. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:30:07
Yep, definitely manipulation. It's not like thousands of people have seen this drop and cashed out. It must just be manipulation. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:19:36
There is NO end to bitcoin lol. The price will go up and down but bitcoin will never just phase out. Short and wait until the price has finished crashing to buy back in. I've been doing it for a while now and have almost doubled my bag. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 16:02:31

I’m from the future by the way

this will see 6k again before 9k

hop on boys, here we go!
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:45:07
I don't think its ended. It'll go sideways for a while and then jump up again.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:40:55
we'll climb to $9000 and people will still be convinced this is not a bull run lol

@_date: 2018-03-30 18:49:51

@_date: 2018-02-25 14:05:17
short and reload at 9k.

Classic Mortar and pestle forming on the hourly, stay tuned for more accurate graph predictions 
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:46:58
the only prediction I can make is that the people that keep 'predicting' a bull trap are the same salty ones that shorted at the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:58:10
higher lows... higher lows...
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:36:15
Just a quick reminder for everyone. Just over 2 months ago bitcoin was at around 19k. Two months before that bitcoin was at around 9k. We can go up as quickly as we can go down, we have almost recovered from the crash. This year will be incredible for bitcoin! We are only $7.5k away from the ATH. We have gone just over $5.5k since the recent crash. Knowing this, if the bullish run continues we will see a new ATH in the coming month. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:34:05
watch the charts. Watch the order books. You're dreaming if you think this can pick up and sustain momentum in the short term. We need a drop down to 6k again to create more hype when everyone starts to buy in again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:18:38
If you’re worried just remember that no one likes to sell for a loss. 90% of people are shorting and will buy back in once we reach bottom. This will create a new FOMO at a much lower price which will skyrocket the price back up. Anyone that has currently lost money, don’t stress, be grateful that you’ll finally be apart of the next massive run! 
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:38:58
the bigger the drop the bigger the next run up. Short and wait for it to start, its easier to make money in this bear market than when its bullish. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:46:43
falling wedge blah blah don't buy now blah blah bitcoin to 7k blah blah LOL IT JUST JUMPED $250. friendly reminder you can't predict bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-19 02:22:04
goes up $4000 in a week. Drops $500 in a day. Quick everyone its gonna crash!!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:48:36
The lower this goes the bigger it'll bounce. We witnessed this with the drop to 6k recently. Bounced to 11k in a week.. thats almost double. I hope this drops, because once we hit the bottom its money making time. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:40:28
this subreddit is literal evidence of how easy this market is to predict. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:57:19
We've seen 6k, now lets see 9k. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:00:17
God I'd be nervous if I shorted because of the tax day fud.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:07:55
I'm sick of hearing all this absolute shit about manipulation and "bad news" making the price drop. These pump and dumps is just normal day trading combined with people that have never invested before shitting themselves only to buy back in later, rinse and repeat. You're making it so easy for the rest of us to make money on these swings when you know half the market will panic sell at a $100 drop in price.
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:10:33
lots of sell orders triggered at 9k. I don't think many will want to get burned again. Give this another small push to 9k and we should climb quickly to 9.1
@_date: 2018-04-15 14:55:42

@_date: 2018-04-22 16:30:16
omfg the 70btc fake wall keeps moving backwards, someone really doesn't want their short position burned hahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:53:46
What a battle! I think we will see 9.1k within the next 24 hours. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:59:58
4k by tomorrow. WHERE ARE YOU NOW
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:35:50
crypto doesn't revolve around the US like everyone thinks it does. Just like futures etc, this will have little impact. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:01:10
I really don't think you'll get another chance to buy below $8k. Risky if you aren't in now.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:33:24
He had opened up a short position at $7100. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:34:15
all these people suddenly telling everyone else to sell. Sounds like shorts are scared they'll get burned come tomorrow hahaha

he deleted it like I said he would hahahha
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:07:40
in theory this makes sense but its not practical. Bitcoin is priced on its worth like anything, it was worth more a few months ago because more people invested in it and more money flowed in. There is no "reasonable price" because you can't measure reasonable. Yes if you take out the boom late last year we are still growing, and I understand what you're saying, but bitcoin "shouldn't" be anywhere because its not something we can measure. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:58:33

I live in Australia and can say with confidence this is a BIG thing in terms of people starting to not trust banks and look elsewhere. This is very good for bitcoin and crypto in general. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 23:16:34
every drop is being bought back just as fast. The last week has showed us this is clearly going to keep moving up. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:16:09
why people are shorting now is beyond me. Begging to be burnt. Been saying it all week lol
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:57:38
You literally just confirmed what I was saying. Its so easy to make money when you know people will short at fake walls.
