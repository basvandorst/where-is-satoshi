That’s BS.  It’s not a scaling issue. It’s a management issue.  
Let’s say you start up a restaurant and it gets 5 star reviews and there are lines out the door every day.  All is good until one day your stove breaks down.  You can’t serve any food and it will take days to repair.  The normal response would be to regretfully send your customers home and close the business until the stove is fixed.  But the Coinbase response is to continue seating customers, taking orders, and charging for food that isn’t served.  And, while people are complaining about not getting their food, they keep cramming more customers into the restaurant.  Then they send the manager around apologizing for their “hyper-growth” issue, while continuing to shove more customers into the building.

Read up on the [1792 Coinage Act](
The dollar was tied to the Spanish silver dollar, not gold.  It’s a common error stated by the Bitcoin community.

Still has nothing to do with the original point which you continue to miss.  Not surprised though. You’ll learn more when you get to 9th grade social studies.

It’s just hard to take your opinions seriously when you have a very serious gap in knowledge.  We have such easy access to info, and yet you were so insistent on something that was easily proven to be wrong.

I’m dead serious.  You need a history lesson.  Read up on the [1792 Coinage Act]( When the dollar was created, it was pegged to the Spanish silver dollar.  Yours is a very common and incorrect misunderstanding.

It wasn’t tied to gold. That’s just wrong.

Except it’s not.  Try selling your rental car to someone and see how that goes.

That’s not even close to true.  The fact that people upvote this shows the inherent lack of basic economic understanding by many in this sub.

You should look at this sub as an opportunity to learn. Don’t be frustrated when you’re wrong.  A lot of people have a limited understanding of monetary theory and it’s history.  You’re not alone.

Your two initial claims in response to the USD going up “infinity” since inception were:  1. The US dollar was tied to gold at inception and 2. The Us Dollar was initially a claim check that could be turned into a bank for gold.  Both of those points are false.  
We’ve established that the dollar was tied to Spanish silver and, the larger point is, you could not take a US dollar to the Spanish government and get Spanish silver in return.  The US dollar initially had value because we agreed it had value. It was not backed by Spanish silver.  So all of your blurred points are inaccurate and/or misleading.

Because you’re not taking into account the dealer’s hand.  Greater than 50% chance of not busting =/= greater than 50% chance of winning.
