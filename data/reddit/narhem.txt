Look at the united states denomination, its people that helped make the country what it is. Most of these people have nothing or very little to do with tech other than Alan Turing.

I'm sure if you took the value of the box when transacted it will be closer to $1k, either way I saw r/bitcoins ads all over reddit for a good amount of time so I'm sure at least some of that money was well spent.

do you throw away you credit cards every time you use them? no so they aren't as bad. I go scuba diving pretty often, do you know how many credit cards I have found? 0, do you know how many plastic bags? usually once a dive. 
Honestly you sound deluded as fuck. Median household income for the US is 50k, with 2 earners per household. I mean don't get me wrong in my neighborhood everyone has their porsche and/or a ferrari plus a GL or X5 to haul their kids around. I don't go on the internet and say it like its nothing. Doing that would make me sound like an asshole(I do see the irony). 
Especially reddit which consists of relatively low income single guys do not like hears they don't make X or Y income.

I mean I'm sure you saying your income doesn't help. Especially if you are making that much but aren't smart enough to realize why they do it. You are also saying saving the world by reducing waste is "shit".  This makes you look like a bad person.

They do this to discourage having non recyclable trash. You are supposed to bring your own non-disposable bags
