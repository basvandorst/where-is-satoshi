Why don't they report on all those buses that DON'T crash into a ravine? And where have you been, the hype was absolutely insane prior to this crash.

You're sitting on a pile of internet funny money watching its value collapse, but my landlord is an idiot for owning actual land? Lol.

Not until you get your money back, right?

This is what dumb money sounds like, folks. Anyone who sold in the last few weeks should thank idiots like this. You wouldn't have made your money without them lol

I'm not putting any rent money into crypto, my point was that crypto is functionally useless in the real world until exchanged for something people like landlords and car dealers, etc, will accept. I'm actually waiting for the price to hit the bottom of the crater and stay there for a bit before buying some myself. I'd rather buy some cheap, and cash out a modest return before most of the people "hodl"ing here even get back to breaking even from buying at the ath. If the price ever goes back up to around 20k again at all. They'll probably be waiting years for that, and in the meantime will need actual money to pay bills.

Maybe focus on making a useable "currency" that's isn't laughably volatile first, then move on to public infrastructure lol.

More like it's still not attractive. Maybe for a subset of paranoid libertarian types, sure. But banks exists because they make things easier, making up a convoluted "solution" to bank who's only advantage over banks is "no bank" just isn't attractive to broader audiences.
