As a new exchange, we have the chicken/egg problem. We need buyers to get sellers and sellers to get buyers. The 'free' period is a way to entice people to place orders and build up the orderbook.

haha. True. We actually have a prioritized list of TODOs. The first being a trade-feed-api which will come online in the next day or so. This will allow 3rd party charting. Second, we are working on integrating our own charts into the website.
Our top priorities are always accuracy, speed, and security. Look for a 2auth option to be added shortly.

Ideally, we will make the fees both flat and lower. If we are processing trades efficiently, we should still be making enough to cover server costs. We don't care about the costs of code development. That's the fun part for us.

thanks! We have limited resources and while beautifying the site is important to us, it's not a critical feature. "It's on the list!"

looks like we're having a problem with Chrome. We're looking at it now.

Hello, The Chrome login issue should be fixed now. thanks!

Good question. Our intention to build up a reputation for quick, accurate, and safe trades. By being free, we are hoping that people will give the service a try, and let us build up that positive reputation.
When we eventually start charging a flat-rate exchange fee, it's going to be something like 0.02 bitcoin. Something way below what the major exchanges charge.

We're still determining the final requirements. We have 180 days to sort it out with FinCEN.
Also, one benefit of being a free service is the simplification of our taxes for this current year (assuming we can afford to be free until January).

That's a valid point, but we are trying to set ourselves apart from other exchanges, and give people a choice. The whole thing is debatable, however, we most likely won't be charging exchange fees until January 2014, and we'll never have withdrawal fees.

We are based in southern California. Since there are no hard-currencies being traded, we can be in the USA.
We are free for the foreseeable future. At some point down the line we will start charging a small flat-rate exchange fee. This will cover the costs of the servers. However, we will never charge withdrawal fees. It's ludicrous that other exchanges have withdrawal fees.

There are no exchange fees and no withdrawal fees at CoinedUp.com. Typical exchanges will charge a percentage of your trade as a fee. Most exchanges will also charge a fee to withdraw your bitcoin, etc..

We still have a few CSS/ajax improvements to make, but it's mostly all there.

Great Idea! As a dev, I hope this subreddit does well.

Thanks for the input. It just takes time. We only have so many resources to put into CSS. We will be making iterative improvements.
