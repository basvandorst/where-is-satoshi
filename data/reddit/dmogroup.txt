hi I wasn't aware you can give extra fee for a smoother transaction ;) 
I can switch it on , to ask ? I guess that way it asks me how much I want to pay to the bitcoin network - 
how long did it take your brother in laws transaction to complete , in the end , rough idea .. ? thanks

hi, not sure whats going on -  how do I check if the fee has been removed - that may be it they thinking cheap skate let him wait lol ! hope not
@_date: 2015-03-05 13:55:31
if I was to up the fee to the network do they process it quicker ..
I didn't even know about the fees and weather you can set them or not - so at the moment , the transaction may be slow because a low amount of fee is offered  ?
I don't mind waiting as long as my 2k is not lost ! do you know how long the wait may be , and is there a way to give the network more fees 
thanks in adv ..

hello buddy , 
thanks for the reply - the 2k is in process - so if I phrased it to the bitwallet - do you think it would stop all transaction and bring the 2k back - also (im on bread wallet - so will it matter , im trying to send it to bitwallet)
