I think you should investigate race attacks.  No compromised node is necessary.

Thanks.  Very much appreciate your replies.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:59:59
Got it, so after six confirmations it is available to me?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:21:26
Yet again...
People have holdings in both Bitcoin and in dollars. When presented with an expense that can be paid in either dollars or Bitcoins, in an appreciating bitcoin market they will choose to pay in dollars.
They will not pay in bitcoin because their bitcoin are appreciating significantly.  They will not convert dollars into bitcoin simply to immediately pay via bitcoin because that is significant extra effort for absolutely no benefit when they can pay in dollars directly.
Yet again...
If people have holdings in both dollars and Bitcoins, then when they are presented with an expense that can be paid in either dollars or Bitcoins, in an appreciating bitcoin market they will choose to pay in dollars.

What I am saying is that bitcoin is rising so precipitously that people are reluctant to part with them to buy goods and services.
If you have to buy something that costs $1,000, you won't pay for it with a bitcoin that will be worth $1,100 tomorrow, you will pay USD.
The rocket appreciation in bitcoin price will, for as long as it lasts, have a serious limiting effect on actual bitcoin commerce for real goods and services.

So if Mike's payment to me gets one confirmation and the funds are made available to me, and I immediately spend those funds with Bob, but then Mike's transaction is discovered to be a double-spend on the fifth confirmation, then no action is taken with me but Bob is the one out of luck when his transaction with me proves out as a double-spend?
Sorry, you can not respond at anytime, I'm not electing you my tutor.  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:12:15
No one is doing A or C right now because they are trying to keep as much capital as they can in bitcoin.
If an expense comes up and they have the opportunity to pay with USD or Bitcoin, they will pay with USD to keep their bitcoin in the market.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:24:30
Yup, although I'm trying to look past the experimental phase a bit.
Although necessary, I can tell you that asking them to come back is a non-starter unless that's part of the product model.
Dry cleaners, shoe repair, all that is fine.  But no retailer that doesn't already do that will bother.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:06:52
But if we are going to reach an era (sooner than expected) when no additional Bitcoins will be minted, doesn't that mean a constant attrition in the number of coins in circulation as various people die, or forget to back up their wallets, or lose devices with wallets on them with no backup?
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:50:04
This and your other posts make me think you are responding to the wrong thread or something.  What you're posting is completely disconnected from everything I've said.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:57:27
Understood, and the parts that are fuzzy I can follow up on my own.
Great post, thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:22:07
Thanks, but I don't need reassurance overall, I'm just trying to get the details so I understand it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:45:53
Thanks.  Are my "what I know" assumptions above correct?
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:03:42
Not everybody, of course.  Only people who are bullish on the future and think about what they're doing.
If you think that bitcoin will keep appreciating like it is, and you had a choice today and yesterday whether to spend bitcoin or dollars and you choise Bitcoins, then that was simply a dumb financial decision.
In a market the majority of people will act in their own best interest which, under current market conditions and if you believe bitcoin will keep appreciating, is to spend dollars.
Making a terrible financial decision puts you in the serious minority.  Most people will actually think their decision through.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:28:57
Thanks, I'm digesting this now, but a quick response to part of it.
For smaller retailers like me the chargeback comparison doesn't really work.  
For big retailers it's just an expense.  For people like me it's really an arbitration process in a dispute with a customer.  I fight all my chargebacks and haven't lost a single penny to them.
I suppose some people don't consider the time responding to chargebacks to be worth it, but ultimately they are substantially under our control, we know who the customer is, we know the transaction, and the card company acts as a third-party arbitrator.
With bitcoin none of that exists, and it would just be lost.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:11:04
Yes, a second transaction. 
The retail transaction is, for example, sent without a transaction fee.  The retailer lets you out of the store with 0 confirmations, but unknown to them I have sent another transaction with a transaction fee to another account I control.
There is a likelihood that the transaction with the fee will be processed by miners first, making the retail transaction a double-spend and invalid, but by then I'm long gone.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:14:43
Great information, thanks so much.
There is some time, but not always, and a hundred different ways for an entrepreneurial mind to deal with waits in a positive way, from processing the transaction and then pulling it from inventory all the way to letting them use practice rooms for free while they wait.  
But for people who just want to run their business, have no interest in geek stuff, and are indifferent to finding ways to make Bitcoin work this is a serious barrier.
I know a lot of guys with the same size places as me, a few locations, but definitely not a chain, and they don't give a shit about *anything* but keeping the doors open.  If they're told that they have to train and then trust their part-time minimum wage senior in high school counter girl to hold people until X many confirmations if a sale is over X dollars but can let them leave right away if it's under Y then they just won't bother.
Please understand, I'm obviously on Bitcoin's side here, but I'm a geek.  Local merchants, Main Street storefront businesses, have a million things to worry about already and I guarantee they won't look at anything that isn't plug-and-play and cash-and-carry.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:45:52
Nope, just a transaction against a vendor accepting zero-confirmation transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:55:21
For thing that you can pay for in either dollars or Bitcoins, converting dollars to Bitcoins and then paying in bitcoin is just dumb.  It adds an elaborate step.
It also has nothing to do with what I was talking about.  Of course you can convert currencies and pay immediately if you want.  I'm discussing people's propensity to pay a new bill out of their Bitcoins or their dollars when given a choice.  With bitcoin appreciating the way it is they will choose dollars every time.
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:28:49
Yup, reasonable, but I'll be very interested to see how many, if any, actual purchases you get after the initial novelty has worn off.
People are holding their Bitcoins because they are appreciating so fast.  I can't imagine anyone in their right mind spending them.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:02:44
Yeah. I get a little worried when the word of the day is "everything will be fine as long as all participants in the economy are irrational enthusiasts working against their own self interest."
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:12:54
Okay, listen carefully.
I am only talking about *one thing,* and have only been talking about *one thing.* I don't give a flying fuck about anything else you want to talk about.
That one thing is:
*If people have holdings in both dollars and Bitcoins, then when they are presented with an expense that can be paid in either dollars or Bitcoins, in an appreciating bitcoin market they will choose to pay in dollars.*
That's it.  It is correct.  If you do not believe it is true then you are wrong.  If you need to have it explained further then go talk to an economist.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:18:21
So what happens if I spend what's been put in my wallet after 1 conformation, but the transaction after 3 confirmations comes back as a double spend?
The whole chain of transactions is thrown out, I suppose.  
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:57:56
For chrissake, for the ten thousandth time, I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT CONVERTING BITCOIN INTO FIAT CURRENCIES.
I am talking about people who are holding bitcoin and holding dollars deciding which to spend on a new expense.  With bitcoin appreciating so fast they will choose dollars.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:15:13
I never said selling them for dollars.  People will hold them.  That's the whole point.  People are holding them and aquiring as many as they can to hold.
They won't spend them on product and they won't sell them for dollars.  They'll just hold them.  They won't be in circulation and the real bitcoin economy will be frozen.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:37:44
But isn't part of the attraction of this not getting back into middlemen again?  I'm trying to leave Amex behind, not create a new one.  :-)
Network notification always takes just a few seconds?
And once retailers accepting Bitcoin becomes widespread, and the incentive to try to pull off double spends becomes widespread along with it, how often will it happen then?  Is this, for example, something that someone could design a black-hat wallet to automate for people who aren't technically savvy?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:42:57
Got it.
I tend to back into services like that.  I kind of need to know how to implement Bitcoin with just a legal pad and a toaster first, then I use the services that make it easy once I understand it from the guts on up.
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:08:28
True, but they lean strongly against charge-backs, so I'm on the right side if their bias...  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:29:25
Absolutely understand, but I'm asking so many questions specifically because I'm not only trying to look at what's necessary for us to take it at my stores but also look at long-term adoption as a whole.
I'm very familiar with the challenges of sub $5 million local retailers, and the mindsets of their owners, so I want to understand the state of things now so I can potentially contribute perspective as things move along.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:40:16
Yes, but see my post above regarding chargebacks.
This isn't a comparison that works for small retailers that challenge chargebacks.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:32:18
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:35:39
It doesn't take much at all, really.  We usually get three or four a year and they have *always* been attempted fraud.
They buy a trumpet (it's a music store) leave with it, and then try to get it for free by claim it was defective.  People doing chargeback fraud are not that smart however, and don't know that you have to show proof of an attempted return of defective merchandise, so when challenged they quietly drop it.
My understanding from other owners is that chargebacks aren't really a big deal for companies my size.  If something's defective, real customers come back to the store and we always make it right. If you're Target and get a hundred a day I'm sure it's a different story.
You say customers would have to go out of their way to do them, but isn't that just a result of the fact that it isn't too common yet? From the descriptions of the technique would it be possible to just program a black-hat app that takes care of it for people, putting even non-nerds in the game?
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:13:27
Yet again, I have no idea what the hell you're talking about.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:38:58
Good advice, I'll follow up in that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:18:17
Okay, so I see that the transaction has occurred, and that tells me what exactly?
1. That they have a valid Bitcoin address.
1. That they have enough Bitcoins associated with that address to cover the transaction.
1. The Bitcoin I've requested have been put into a sort of "pending transaction queue" but aren't mine yet.
Is that correct?
If so, when do they become irrevocably mine?
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:03:52
Unless I'm misunderstanding you, transactions aren't the same as blocks, and you aren't trying to manipulate  into a longer chain. Your just trying to get your single double-spend transaction to be confirmed before the retailer transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:59:13
Then I guess I'm not sure of the value for anyone of accepting bitcoin.  It just seems like you've added an unnecessary step.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:11:29
That is an English expression generally interpreted as "the vast majority."
If you are not a native English speaker I apologize for the confusion.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:25:58
And how much actual cross-country international purchase of goods and services with Bitcoin are you suggesting is happening right now?
Are you seriously asserting that it is even a detectable influence when discussing the effect of bitcoin holders not spending their coins in an appreciating market?
I'll answer that for you:  While everything you said is a generally correct statement about bitcoin it has no effect on what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:13:52
Yes, of course, but I am talking about what is happening *right now.*
Bitcoin is appreciating so fast that people are holding them.  Not paying for goods and services with them, and that won't end until this explosive growth ends or reverses.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:03:32
I didn't even say bitcoin was irrational!
Are you on drugs?  Your responses have nothing to with what I posted.
Honestly, I don't know what youre talking about and I'm sick of having to type that, so see you later.
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:48:12
I don't even know where to start with that.  I didn't say anything remotely close to that.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:21:24
I have to a certain extent, but I'm still in my how-it-all-works stage.
I'm kind of a detail guy.  :-)
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:53:19
How are you insulated from exchange rate fluctuations?
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:47:12
I think you are missing the point here. I'm not talking about people trading Bitcoins, I'm talking about people spending them on goods and services.
