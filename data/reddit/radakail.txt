He's saying is.... your missing a what there. If your gonna trash talk people at least write in coherent sentences.

Therefore enforcing the original message of crypto. No more centralization. The people using this want to have the government out of their money. They think they can suddenly shove their hand in and not get bitten. It won't just get bitten. It'll be chopped off mailed back with a big sign to the rest of the world "hey see how they won't let you touch your own money? Yep that's why you need us."

It's not totally true. I invested because of reddit... you guys made me jelly as hell seeing all these post. I also bought into some of the smaller cryptos because well... bit is so expensive now. But I came around. Mostly cause I'm a jealous piece of shit but I still came ;-p
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:52:54
Honestly I do care about other people. I don't want people to starve and I don't want people to not have an education. You invested in bitcoin cause you got tired of the government taking your money and the banks... So basically you got tired of the top taking advantage of the bottom... and now you want to just flip the table and do the same thing to everyone else that they did to You? What good comes from that? It doesn't solve anything and will lead to another revolution being built and bitcoin collapsing because it won't be seen as fair.

Just curious cause I seem to see everyone saying stuff like this. Do you really only see a future with 1 crypto? And if so... Why? Why would we only want one coin and not 4 or 5 that are all solid. I'm genuinely asking here. I want some competition. If we ONLY had bitcoin then there wouldn't be anyone to push it to do better. The main reason LN is being pushed so hard is to catch up to others. So imagine if it wasn't being pushed.

What exactly did Ukraine do to piss of Russia? Your argument doesn't hold up here. Also men shooting out of houses doesn't stand up to a military vehicle with a 50 cal on top. Stop spouting nonsense dude. I get wanting a smaller government but some government is nessecary. Just curious..  do you consider yourself a smart man? Do you like being able to read or write? And last but not least.... DID YOU GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL? Yes? Oh okay then.... glad you are literate thanks to... well you know what I'm going to say here dontcha?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:37:29
Okay well at least I get your reasoning now and I think similar to you just not exactly the same. Have a great day and thanks for the convo.

Ha foreigner you think all Americans are dumb eh? Well look whose dumb now. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:52:28
But school taught you to read right? Without being able to read or count you wouldn't have been able to invest in bitcoin from the beginning..   anyways have a good day buddy. I try not to insult people so ima just leave it at that. I'm glad you would rather live in an apocalyptic world than accept that some government is nessecary and I'm super glad the rest of the world doesn't think like you.

Nah... its gonna start spiking just like last year and most likely settle slightly lower than last years ATH. Just my guess tho...

You can assume anything you want. Doesnt mean its correct.

Sticking with the core 3 seem to be the only safe bet. They are the only 3 actually pushing for usability and not just trying to make money. You know what these 3 are....

Honestly all you gotta do is ignore the price for a month. Literally dont look at it. In 1 month I will start back trading. Done this every "bear" run. It works well. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:53:41
The only really safe way is a paper or hardware wallet. But unless your holding significant amounts of coins, keeping them on coinbase really wont matter. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:02:19
Your country shouldn't have a 40% tax on long term investments. Now if he sold in less than a year... than yeah that's probably the rate. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:17:57
Imo bitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin. You could argue 1 or 2 more but this is just my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:03:45
Hell I have to buy ethereum in chunks even during this dip lol
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:12:01
Exactly... coinbase is a business trying to make money. Wtf does this dude expect?
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:37:18
It is sadly the truth... I have investments in the big 3. (Bcash doesnt count cause it just sucks) I did that to have more diversity in my investments. I tried to get people at work involved and guess what they did? Went to a fucking cloud mining site. Now they are all mad and lost all their money even though I told them all dont touch anything other than the main 3. And NEVER let someone hold your money. Always pull it out to your personal storage.

There are 15 million millionaires in America alone... don't know where you got that number. Almost 20% of Americans are millionaires in total assets.

If I ever use crypto to make a purchase I feel like I'm losing any future gains. If Amazon ever takes it, I might buy a gaming computer but that's it. I won't spend the rest. Seriously.... If I bought a gaming computer for 1500. That's 10 litecoin right now...  If it goes to 1000 in a year. That's almost 10k I lost. Not worth it until the price stabilizes. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 07:15:44
Yeah see we both obviously get it. I took 1 litecoin and turned it into 3. I took 1.5 out and put it into my nano. Trading with 1.5... You get what I'm doing. I understand what your preaching so keep doing it bro. People like you kept me from going all in day 1. As of right now I just trust gdax and even if they went out today, it wouldn't be half my total and I would still make a profit. You get it. I get it. Sorry for going so hard man. So many people just talk shit to talk shit ya know. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:29:13
My god... yes that's true. And as soon as word got out that coinbase didn't give people their crypto the business we be out overnight. There a reputable company. It's fucking yours. That's proven they will give it when you want. Stop acting like a fucking 2 year old. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:19:40
How So? Right now bitcoin is at half the price it was a month ago. Investing right now is the best way to get future gains.... 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:08:15
No bank can do that either. You think any bank can magically come up with the cash if every single customer asked to cash out? You have to have trust that a company is reputable based off the history they have shown. Coinbase is about as good as it gets in the crypto world. Also most know gdax is where it's at. They usually move from coinbase to gdax when experienced. It's one of the best and EASIEST to use which is really nice in a world where people who have NO CLUE what there doing are rushing in. I went from 1 coinbase purchase to day trading on gdax in 3 months. It's a great fucking company and I love them honestly. If this new place ends up being legit I might use them as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:50:27
Very possible but most people involved in crypto don't think that will be the all time high. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:16:37
Your wrong. Almost every major u.s credit card company stopped the sale of crypto. I know because all FOUR of mine got stopped.

Isnt ripple literally backed by banks? Genuinely asking...

I'm a paramedic and have investments worth over 150k while being in less than 5k of credit card debt. I think your just a douche who thinks WAY to highly of themselves and you should probably check your cockiness before someone checks it for you. Have a great night.

So you made a good buy in the housing market... BEFORE the housing market collapsed in 08. MUCH WOW, SUCH IMPRESSIVE!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:52:37
I'm not some dumbass that just doesn't listen to what your saying. I actually am going to follow up on the things you have mentioned. I haven't been in the crypto game long. 6 months. I am living paycheck to paycheck. I put 500 into crypto and have turned it into thousands via gains and day trading. I might have found my knack. Idk... I want the best out there. I WILL use the best out there. Right now I haven't found anything better. Maybe???? Binance but I'm not trading 1g at a time so their out the picture. I just hate hearing people talking so much shit about them. I honestly get they have issues. Every company does. But some people talk as if they are literally the devil and they aren't. That's kinda my issue. Sorry for going so hard my first comment. I also don't quite believe shit I read on reddit. We already have proof of banks paying people to shittalk crypto... how do we know those aren't comments from people paid to trash talk coinbase? Not saying I don't believe you. Just saying I don't believe every horror story about a reputable company.
