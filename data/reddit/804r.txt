It got sent to my Localbitcoins wallet, tied to my profile. I transferred some money from there to a market wallet, but they never arrived. Like I said somewhere else, the block seems alright, too.

Last time I checked, 85. That should be enough, right?

Thanks! I'll try that.

It was actually only ~$100, but yeah... It's the only option, so why not?

I bought it from a local seller via localbitcoins.com. This is my first interaction with bitcoins, so I  figured I'd start (relatively) small with 1 BTC. It arrived, no problem, and I spent parts of it without any issues. I sent it to a wallet generated by a market (not sure if such should be discussed here). Like I said, I'm very new at this, but aren't you supposed to not share your addresses?

Thank you, I'll look into it!

No, sorry if that wasn't clear. It was about 0.27 BTC.

Well, I've had a 50% success rate so far, so I guess I'll avoid especially that market, anyway.

Thanks for the tip! What info should I give them and what info should I *not* give them? It's a pretty reputable market, so there shouldn't be a scam involved. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:09:22
It definitively is. I've tried contacting the admins, but no reply yet. I  don't think I got scammed, but I'm definitely not using that market again.

No, I only transferred ~0.27 BTC. What details do you need?
