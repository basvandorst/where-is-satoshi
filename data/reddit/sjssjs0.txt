First korean exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:46:36
About wages, his statement was right for now.
But it’s just early stage. 
For now big gainers want to sell btc to 
solve their fiat problem first.
But after several up &amp; down, 
ppl will choose bitcoin rather than fiat.
When we all know bitcoin don’t move much,
we can get wage by bitcoin.

Korean bitcoin price is now new record high. 
It takes one month to make new record.
Very good atmosphere here.
Korean first bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:46:13
Yeah. Actually it’s not insight.
Every korean investor know korean gov want to kill bitcoin but they cannot.
And plz get the word out at your community what I said.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:10:02
South korea exchange hit new record high.

I can tell reason why volume didn’t surge for one month.
Korean MOFIA (banker + gov) really hate crypto cause they can’t take money from individual investor at stock market anymore.(Korean stock market is uneven playing field for individual player who called ant)
So after bitcoin surge and ant’s money shifted to crypto market from stock market, they started to make and spread FUD.
You can see sudden drop DEC. That day is when korean gov announced to make FUD and it worked (cause noob - who started bitcoin after seeing 10k - didn’t experinced drop &amp; surge of bitcoin so they oversold their bitcoin)
But now situation is different. Even korean noob witnessed rebound of bitcoin price. Now korean gov’s FUD strategy doesn’t work well. FUD time is shorter than before and FUD price is higher than before. 
Korean gov is loosing control now.

Is there rollover or not? Anybody have link? Plz~ 
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:01:13

Foreigner can be banned soon.

@_date: 2018-01-06 03:00:21
Buy more bitcoin and remove korean premium. 
Then no tumble again. 
@_date: 2019-07-31 23:56:06
You idiot. Hodlers don’t search bitcoin on google.

I’m south korean. I hodled 4 years. And what’s tether? We south korrean now just crazy. It’s our temper. We were always fastest follower to be rich in every industry.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:51:49
Me too. $600
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:13:20
16k in south korea now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:16:39
Ok thx. Now I inderstand.
If my bitcoin surge without reason, I feel nervous.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:25:43
I’m south korean. I can tell you. 
For now korean goverment didn’t banned bitcoin.
Our goverment are afraid of two scenario.
If gov approve bitcoin as money and make regulation, every korean could speculate and make side effect.
And if gov banned bitcoin exchange totally, korean can be loser in bitcoin industry.
So this time gov just heared from specialist.
And didn’t mentioned much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:46:15
I think whales should remain world reserve bank.
Fed is not made by goverment, either.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:35:00
I intend to get rid of weak hand.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:51:41
It’s not good. 
Until now programed exchange get less profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:21:09
17k south korea hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:46:44
Thank you very much. I'm happy now.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:17:10
Yes you are right. 
And I think whales should be ready for being
world reserve bank for public. 
Fed is also union of bank.
Bitcoin can be like fed, too.
And about winklevoss
If they would sell every bitcoin to make 
disaster, why are they interviewed and 
blamed for disaster they could make? 
I think we should talk abot whales, 
but don’t worry too much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:40
Really? I didn’t know that.
Sorry. 
I feel shamed
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:41
Hey bro, It’s already 15k in south korea.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:59:00
You understand what I mean even though my english shortness. Thx.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:17:30
It’s also can be a reason. Thx.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:50
Hey, I know about tech and programming, too.
Before ligtning which takes several months, transaction can be slow. 
But 3rd party company help payment fast. 
And fee is not expensive cause so many company will compete.
Then, not as programmer but as consumer, what’s important for me? 
For me bitcoin is convinient currency which’s value is going up, and I don’t have to change korean won to america usd. And when I buy some product it takes 0.02 second. 
That’s why I deposit money to bitcoin every month.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:04:05
Yes that’s what I’m saying.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:14:36
It's written in korean language.
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:45:39
Bitcoin future exchange open soon. 
If bitcoin don’t tumble even though short attack, ETF money will come.
So we should get rid of rabbit.
People invest with borrowed money become rabbit. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:48:23
I think whales should remain world reserve bank.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:24:31
Yes. I think so.
But bitcoin is first mover. 
And I think it will dominate crypto system with eth.
And altcoin’s target is not just crypto. 
Some altcoin will go up as well.
Some altcoin will fail.
And some altcoin like dash should be failed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:43:01
That's what I wanted to say.
But my short english make me write post which is difficult to understand.
Thx clever friend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:29:03
Programmed sell domino. Some people use automatic api to get more profit than average market participants.
Api are programmed to sell large block if there’s big drop. 
This make problem now.
But it’s chance.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:34:26
Actually that’s what I’m worried about.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:50:55
No. 
Every economic system use multiple effect.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:58:27
Yeah. But It’s happy ending now.
Let’s be a good rich man.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:11:16
That's exactly what I want to say.
Fuck my english.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:13
Even korean gov want tax.
If they charge tax for exchange, 
bitcoiner can claim our right.
In korea, atmosphere is different now.
It’s because gov want tax, and bitcoiner can make sound now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:13
I totally agree with this.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:05:42
It’s first huge drop for south korean public. Most of them started recently and lose money these days. We always said ‘don’t invest recklessly.’ But some people borrowed money for shor-term profit and they are failed. So weak hand is big here south korea. 
But if bitcoin price hit 25k again, people will think bitcoin as real money.
And about korean mofia(money mafia), they are actually fucked up. 
They want to invest ico or future trade with national fund money, and it’s more dangerous than bitcoin investment. They think they can rule bitcoin like south korean stock market. And it will make problem.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:47:58
I don’t sell. 
I buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:27
Yes. Now they have just one option. 
They have to buy long more and buy bitcoin more to survive.
It will be hugest short coverage in the history.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:20
Yes right. 
Real transaction occur later.
But I use bitcoin at real life like credit card!
What’s wrong? 
If new tech start, small technical flaw make no matter. 
Cause 3rd party company can help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:59:06
every month. 
I deposit at bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:27:28
Thank you very much. 
Actually you can speak korean, it’s helpful for me. 
Telegram? Or email? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:54:20
3 or 4 years ago. And It stumbled, so I forgot about it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:41:14
Yes right. 
It’s not limited by one country’s price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:19:14
retouched 17k in south korea.
@_date: 2019-06-29 05:29:52
Yeah. 
And it was easier in 2017 cause the volume was smaller than now. 
It’s getting more difficult to manipulate.
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:15:02
Every poison they can inject have been injected. But it won’t work.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:30:12
It’s just image from internet.
Sometimes asians call americans ‘burger’
It’s kind of nickname asians made for usa guys.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:30:13
I think second buyback chance will not exist.  But if you want buy some dollar. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:28:20
Sorry. I’ll delete this post.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:52:14
Thank you very much. After betting before expiration date, plz open your position to the public if you are confident about short position. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:13:44
I didn't say any word about legal punishment. 
You misunderstood my post. 
And I'm not just waiting served justice.
I'm proposing punishment from Bitcoin conference. And that's why I'm writing it in reddit/bitcoin. 
You are just sittting in a chair and watching situation and saying 'oh we can do nothing with law~ we are weak~' in Reddit/bitcoin.
I think you need real lesson. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:05:59
Yeah. I know time to stop. When many people want to teach me, then it's better to stop for me. 
And I started online sentence correction service. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:44:19
'No understanding of bitcoin, economies, law, or English'? 
Wow you seem understand bitcoin and economy well. 
Then can you tell me why it's 'sloopy incoherent mess'? 
Hey genius plz explain how fund with moral hazrd could avoid punishment(with english).
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:32:10
Ok before I go to sleep, I need to tell you something. I'm not mad at jp morgan. And you think bitcoin doesn't work that way. But already bitcoin have conference to make BTCC. 
And post - I write sometimes about truth of jp morgan and proposal of disadvnatage to them - doesn't have reason to annoy you.
And when I'm bored I can argue it. Because it's not 'illegal'. JP morgan and related guys can feel annoyed about my post. But it's also 'not illegal'. 
And they deserve it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:45:47
About bcash I still have it, too. ㅠㅠ
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:24:13

Bitcoin is endgame. 
I want to make venture to change world.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:20:54
Yeah, actually I want to make coin for basic income system. I have an idea for system, but my main job is dentist. I’m worried I can’t make it. That’s why I thought bitcoin as good player.
@_date: 2018-07-20 11:24:31
Is here anybody want to make it with me? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:10:57
