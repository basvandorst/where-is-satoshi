Sincere answer: Segwit is not the answer as IMO its just a temporary bandaid in my opinion. As well as you have people trying to literally dominate the blockchain and you guys are literally at war with your own kind on which is better segwit vs segwit2x. Like come on, this is just getting crazy. With BCH, I feel like the larger block size IS the the right path, and as I feel this way I do not care what happens with bitcoin. I focus on the future of my own preferred coin.

Whats with all this childish degradation of a people who hold a different coin than you. This will only shove crypto in general to the ground. Bunch of childish nonsense.

If you think this in an attempt to hijack bitcoin you're very paranoid. I am solely on board of BCH for the simple preference of its technology. I felt that bitcoin itself needed this for awhile. However, since nobody can agree and it is in fact a shit show at the moment. Ill take my own safe preference. BCH.

You are the grade A example of an uneducated user. Thanks for strengthening my argument.

You're not debating with me here, what I'm saying that the "trucking" may soon enough come to an end.

I don't personally believe it was bad as the present situation and what might happen on August 1st.

I first bought BTC in 2013, don't assume buddy.

My main point here is just the uncertainty of the holders with the UASF coming along. I'm sure there is a way to fix it, however, it feels right now the BTC reddit is torn into two and that would affect the price. I feel that August 1st will be a big moment for bitcoin regardless what happens and based on what happens will influence my purchase back in or not. I hope that this event wont cause negative outcomes.

Bitcoin isn't done, however I think it will face challenges that might make people move to currencies that are more ideal.

Here you are with an irrelevant statement. Where did I spell it incorrectly? Sorry my capitalization doesn't appeal to you. Learn the difference.
