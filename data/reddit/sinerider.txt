I like screengrab. I've been using it for years.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:50:42
It looks like an imitation of reddit. Are websites allowed to imitate other websites like that? I'd be worried about getting sued.

Even if it does not become a useful currency, Bitcoin will be a great way to store and transfer wealth, without shipping gold bars around the world, for example.
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:29:18
Really cool, nice work!
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:55:51
Troll harder dude.

They might actually be working on that...

Post the number here so that this can be verified.

Yes, normal withdrawal form. For some reason this is affecting only some people. My account is verified but I don't have 2FA enabled.
@_date: 2014-06-09 15:08:56
I think that people outside the Bitcoin community have no idea about all these exciting things. Bitcoin needs a killer-app or another period of media hype in order to raise awareness, and therefore demand.
@_date: 2014-03-03 02:50:20


So how are they still active, and their domain not seized and hosting company raided?
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:08:00
"You can't ignore it" phase confirmed. Next bubble incoming.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:39:50
Bitcoin could crash to $1 tomorrow. Or a nuke could detonate in Wall Street. Neither are very likely to happen.
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:36:49
The Bitcoins you are buying are held by localbitcoins and released to you after you confirm that you have received the money. The people most likely to be scammed are the ones selling Bitcoins, not the buyers. Try it out, it's a great system.

I bought it for Destiny. I'll probably have to buy a Xbox One for Halo 5 next year as well. I'm a big Halo fan.

Paypal requires a bank account. Not an option for many people.
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:07:50
Good point. Anyone that dumped a large sum into bitcoin in the early days was already loaded. You'd have to be, to consider gambling large amounts of money on a new experiment.

It's easy to say you'll keep buying as the price is falling. But at some point you have spent all your money buying and the price is still falling. That was my situation.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:00:02
There are even Bitcoin banks now, that provide cold storage services and insurance.
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:39:52
No point arguing with him. He clearly stated that he has more BTC than everyone else, therefore he must be right.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:05:07
Nice find. I commend him for his experimentation. But I find it incredible that anyone would actually deploy a self made SSH server written in PHP in a production environment.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:38:05
And yet the price continues to slowly slide down and feels like it could go into freefall at any minute.
@_date: 2014-04-18 10:46:29
Nothing because I haven't sold yet.
@_date: 2014-11-25 14:26:55
Women + Bitcoin? Does not compute.
@_date: 2014-01-21 10:26:28
Such lol
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:51:13


Or maybe just not good with computers. My friends believe in Bitcoin but they have no idea how to get any and store them securely. I don't encourage them. Their computers are ridden with viruses and keyloggers.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:13:11
I thinks it's near the bottom now. People who are selling now are gambling. There will be a fast upwards correction.
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:36:28
There is no problem buying Bitcoins in the UK.
I have a regular account with NatWest and have sent large amounts of money to Bitstamp dozens of times without any problems.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:50:18


Not necessarily. Whoever owns the wall can easily modify it to make it seem as if it is being eaten.
@_date: 2014-08-25 03:27:33


Doesn't look dead to me. $6.6 billion market cap, and I recently used it to buy a PS4.

I have all my wealth in Bitcoin. Exiting now when the price is low would be the worst thing to do. This is the time to buy. Bitcoin is not going to die.
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:09:40
I am guessing that he was spreading wallet-stealing malware somehow. It feels good to know he has been taken down. Possessing 100g of coke is even enough to jail this parasite.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:38:56
Before Gox we were stable at $800+. This recovery is underwhelming so far. I expected more, but I guess people are still nervous.
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:13:48
There's no way they will ban it now. But they will try to regulate the hell out of it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:43:21
Nice. I am tempted to take out a loan. There may never be a better time to buy.
@_date: 2014-09-19 12:03:41
You have sold at, or near, the bottom.
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:52:59


Nice conspiracy. But they didn't buy anywhere near enough coins to be able to do something like that. Soon these walls will start to get bought.
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:27:53




I agree, although I think the obsoletion of smart phones is at least a decade away, not near future.
@_date: 2014-02-20 17:08:38
Withdrew 12 BTC only a few hours ago. No problems. My account is verified.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:51:13
Satoshi probably has something better than Tor.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:23:23
I think we'll see higher than $1000 this year.
@_date: 2014-04-07 07:44:22


You could use localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:31:31
Cashing out now would be fucking stupid. BUY!
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:15:50
Why would that worry you? I think it is good that it recovers so quickly.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:26:16
So you only buy Bitcoin to make money?
If I had more than enough money to live comfortably, I'd store a large chunk of it in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:23:13
Check this out for a glimpse into the future:
@_date: 2014-12-10 02:39:45
There are only about 13.5 million BTC in circulation. But lets assume blockchain had 25% all the BTC and they all got stolen... The Bitcoin price would crash hard, but it would not die. Progress would be set back another year or two, no doubt.
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:28:46
He was implying that Mt. Gox was a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-03-29 12:48:11


Why wouldn't they? Bitcoin is not dead.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:48:03
A stop-loss seems like a bad idea to me. It's a pre-programmed way to sell at a low. A better idea would be to simply invest less, if you are worried about a total collapse of Bitcoin down to zero.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:21:52
I would apply in a heartbeat if it was practical for me to move to Finland. I am a web developer between projects and looking for something Bitcoin-related to work on.
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:28:24


$10k worth of Bitcoin? :P
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:43:13
Snap. My average is about $850. I bought as high as $1100. I have little doubt we will break even again soon.
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:30:41
The least he could do is apologize. But I don't think he even did that. The fucking scumbag thinks he's untouchable.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:56:10
But surely the worst has already happened. I can't imagine any news that can be as bad as what happened yesterday.
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:07:36
I'm impressed by how quickly he built this business from scratch.
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:05:13


Those are commercial products. Bitcoin is a protocal and a currency, and it can be adapted and improved over time.
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:24:15
No future? Maybe you didn't notice that Bitcoin is still under heavy development. Both the protocol and the infrastructure. People are quitting their jobs to work on Bitcoin startups. There are mining operations the size of sports fields popping up all over the world. I have no doubt that sooner or later a huge wave is coming.
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:34:58
Nice ;)
@_date: 2014-09-11 10:51:04
Tell that to the early adopters.
@_date: 2014-02-17 15:58:54
If you hold, you don't have to realize a loss. The only reason to do what you suggest, is to take a gamble on a falling price and buy back in lower.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:43:18


Great answer
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:44:26


Translates to me as: "I want an entire economy to collapse because I had years to buy Bitcoin cheap but I didn't and now I can't afford to."
Think about all the people and businesses that would be fucked if Bitcoin did actually crash to single digits.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:39:23
You're obviously trolling. Go and do something interesting with your life.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:28:37
I don't hate AWS. They deliver a great service. I use S3 for all media storage. But I run all my apps and databases on my own hardware outside US jurisdiction, for obvious reasons.


Another reason not to use it.
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:05:52
Wait until what? The price has recovered? In crypto, you don't make gains by playing safe.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:56:01
Running on your own hardware is cheaper, more secure, lets you have more control, you can run whatever operating system you want, no traffic limits / additional charges and you can host websites anywhere the world. Not to mention that cloud hosting is a form of centralization.
@_date: 2014-09-09 00:01:39
He wouldn't have lost anything if he had not been so impatient. It's sad actually.
@_date: 2015-01-10 17:30:14
AWS employees would have root access to Amazon's virtualization hypervisor but not to the OS instances running within. They would have no way to log in to Bitstamp's servers / databases.
None of your attack vectors are possible.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:01:27
No chance. This is targetted spam.
@_date: 2014-07-28 03:20:59

@_date: 2015-07-20 20:44:17
No but I would be happy to contribute some bits to have your scummy site hacked too.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:23:27
You sound surprised that they did the *right thing*. That is kind of sad.
@_date: 2015-07-20 21:00:47
Well for a start you need access to the data they stole. If you can get that data, you can make good money via either spamming or extortion. I'm perfectly cool if you want to do that to Ashley Madison's userbase.
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:27:12
I like their service, and commend you for donating, but they should have given it back. They have just lost a bit of respect from me after reading that.
@_date: 2015-04-17 12:49:51
Except there is a skill to trading the stock market, trading Bitcoin is basically gambling.
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:41:39


I don't think so. A total economy collapse will take down all services, internet and power, with it.
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:44:07
But what about the hundreds of thousands of people around the world who work full time to keep the internet running. Will they still turn up to work for free? And how will they get to the office without fuel?
@_date: 2015-09-29 21:43:19
There's nothing wrong with Ruby, or any language, if you know what you're doing.

How can you prove that someone isn't running a network of reddit bots, interfaced with something like Amazon mechanical turk or some kind of cheap paid human input, to game the system by posting hundreds of entries?
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:52:41
Actually I believe that is possible. If Bitcoin starts to dominate world finance, there will be a tipping point and it will change the world as we know it.
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:12:25
I use them for hosting. I would like to use them for domains, but they don't support the same level of whois privacy as namecheap. They will hide your street address and email address, but not your name.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:53:04


This is a good idea, and it should be relatively simple to implement. I hate having to open my BTC wallet all the time in order to check my balance.
A minimum threshold could be configured in order for the chime/alert to be triggered. Or maybe even different sounds for different sized payments.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:13:43
Just stop trading, buy at market price when you need/want BTC, and get a real job.
@_date: 2015-10-20 16:00:41
Sorry I deleted my comment because I don't feel comfortable discussing this, then I saw you'd replied already.
I don't know how the people who run that site can sleep at night. I wondered if it is some form of activist statement, artistic maybe, not to be taken seriously. But I worry that people do actually use it with serious intentions.
