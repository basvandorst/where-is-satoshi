Even if you picked a legit company back then, they were most likely swept under in the bust. And it took 5 years for things to really start cooking again.
That's what they hated &amp; that is probably what will happen with crypto too at some point.

Gold has lots of interesting properties that make it ideal for use as currency. 
It still has a place in a balanced portfolio, especially considering almost any other asset is overpriced these days.

Things like crossing 10k have big psychological implications.
It's not a symmetrical risk.. the upside is maybe 1-2k, the downside could easily be 5.  
Sitting back and watching anyway...

I think guaranteeing a (non-exploitative) job to anyone who wants it would be more valuable.  Most people find their own way, but for the 5% who don't - work at a living wage should be a basic human right.
There are plenty of menial jobs that are currently tendered out by government - e.g. mowing your local park could be in-sourced as a social programme.
And if they couldn't find you suitable work, some sort of no-catch subsistence payment would be the safety net (some people really shouldn't be working anyway).

So when they want to mess with Iran in future, they have incentive to mess with bitcoin. Probably fix Venezuela at the same time.
I'm not sure this is what you want.

Earn fiat online, cash out to amazon gift card, trade for crypto online.
Or you could starve I guess...

Because there are heaps of legit anonymous ways that pay amazon gift card. Gonna be hard to open up a paypal or whatever from Venezuela

Maybe that's more of a comment about what's going to happen to the USD. Inflation will show up eventually.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:25:26
um.. don't think you've thought that one through.
The debt pile already can disappear whenever the US wants it to (print).. but if they have a worthless currency, people will want security going forward in some other currency or commodity that can't be printed. 
Oil or gold maybe.

[These guys are doomsayers]( but still it makes a lot of sense.
You get to attack and undermine rival economies, without losing control. E.g. imagine Aliexpress paying affiliates in Yuan crypto, and then those people using it as a parallel currency - esp in the 3rd world.
It's a case of "do it to others, before it is done to them".
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:30:59
I think an official crypto Yuan is a real risk at this point.

Even better, you could generate the power anywhere in space. You're converting it to crypto, which you can transfer back without any cost.
At a certain energy cost (especially if there is a carbon/pollution cost), all sorts of solutions become viable &amp; it would unload the burden on Earth's energy supply and environment. Especially if you're going to Mars anyway.

Depends on what you buy with it. $1 now gets you way more computing power than in 1988 for instance.

You can take a walk down to a gold dealer and get a standardized price for well known bullion coins..or spot minus a % if it is any other object. This works in any country, worldwide. Then you buy your bread.
That's how it has worked for thousands of years - and it's a far easier way to buy bread than with bitcoin

Selling across the board will suck money out of the space generally

@_date: 2018-12-07 03:32:45
Sure you can do that, but why should they tolerate you if you exercise your "freedom" to transfer money to their rivals and undermine their rule of law.
Failure to recognize that crypto is the natural enemy of almost all types of government is what has got it where it is today. Only failed states like Yemen and Zimbabwe have no say over their currency.

It's pretty dumb that it traded that high when people could sell futures at $19K as the cost of mining was a few thousand.
It's all about where the cost of mining will stabilize at once the weak hands are purged. In that respect I don't think we've even started yet.

I really don't think so.. crypto in its current form is an insignificant bug that can be stepped on in a million different ways. It's broken by design.
@_date: 2018-12-06 18:46:46
It also undermines the sovereignty of a country and affects their ability to issue currency and debt - e.g. capital flight in Venezuela. Widespread flaunting of capital controls eventually leads to parallel currencies and a subversion of democracy.
For the people who live in these countries, that's a bad thing - unless they like being a colony.

Well after BTC is sub $1 and any dude with a couple hundred bucks can 51% it I think you might say job done.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:53:42
If you've held since $20K in the belief BTC would take over the world you'd be right to be upset... cause you are clearly wrong
I think the premise has promise.. but this version of it is simply garbage that can't even withstand a couple of rich people with rented hashpower. BCH is not much different to BTC and it is being totally eviscerated right now.
