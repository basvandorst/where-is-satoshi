Can you get Hearn to code you your 30gb per 10 min paypal please? And craig wright to keep it malleable and turing complete?

The main reason pow is better than pos is it can be usurped. Hence decentralized
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:04:18
I think he even said centralized in the video.
But hey 30gb per 10 mins plus chinaweb latency would totally not make btc a paypal for retards... Theyd go to chairman mao with their muh my asics algorithm argument...

Whereas your sadshit for brains has been around here for 4 weeks and you still havent sold the bitcoins for the electricity it should be costing you to make them in a truly decentralized mining scene. Keep up the shilling and youll see yourself how long Jihancoin utxo bloat spam bloat chinacoin lasts where things really matter, and just how much a pow changewill cost you.
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:16:15
But my point is how was btce supposed to know if he didnt tell anyone while it was happening?
Btce has definitely let lots of stolen coins but if it didnt btc wouldnt be fungible itd be worthless

Whereas you want miners to risk angering 90% of the community into a POW change. After all 90 per cent is what proof of vitalik managed to drag onto his chain and it is much loved over at your echo chamber. Otherwise im sure the community will love your 30gb per 10 minute plan. The one hatched up by shitcoiners that hate decentralization and gold standards.

@_date: 2017-07-08 05:40:03
Bitfury did the study of 95% drop off of nodes at 8mb. Jihan has often showed disregard of non mining nodes and thinks bitcoin only goes on a datacenter. Bitmain did write up a blogpost threatening to hard fork if he didnt get to assign thedevs. You dont get to entice noobs by saying this is only 2mb when its a scaling debate, not just an insignificant compromise, and those 30gb per 10min are very much on the road map of the 2x crowd.
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:26:53
Soft fork. Corrected it for you buddy. Get busy on your bitmaincoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:05:47
Rbitcoin doesnt censor. It merely forbids attempted takeovers and altcoin silling.
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:29:23
Fork when theres true decentralization and proper code. Not a chinacoin paypal 2.0

2x isnt 2mb. Its 8mb as core had already planned basic segwit which lifted the size. To 4mb. Miners want it all on the base layer so bitmain posted a plan to hard forl on his blog that includes sonething 200mb blocks or so by 2019. And 30gb per 10 minutes is what it would take to serve the planet all on the base layer
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:03:01
They'd induce shittier tx onto the chain, bloating it and devaluing it. Solution is altcoins on sidechains and second layers. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:23:32
Wow. Is that all the slimeballs at rbtc have taught you?
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:43:53
Look at you waxing all romantic just because you got the mining cartels and a flurry of shitcoiners over at the other sub looking to centralize bitcoin because bitcoins decentralization and innovation renders them useless. Consensus doesnt mean shit and is worth zilch without decentralization. Because its worthless in and of itself.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:44:15
Two wtfs:
Bitcoin includes stuff all the way from qeditas to maximalism. At every stop of the way decentralization is a tastier apple than consensus.
Modest increase? LOL. Did you see your benevolent dictators roadmap? He said 16mb blocks by may 2019. Case closed.

@_date: 2017-06-13 00:40:27
Decentralization is the end. Consensus is ever changing and banal. Consensus is merely a means to the end, one of many means. Thats why they call bitcoin antifragile. Thats why you do backroom deals with miners and exchangers but not with coders. Jesus, dont they teach the shitcoiners at the other sub anything?

@_date: 2017-06-30 15:24:03
Miners merely give security to the code and verify the network. Miner profits tend to zero because youre supposed to be competing with other miners. The error was to give you lot and your easily replaceable algorithm veto power.
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:29:04
Bitcoin never required consensus for anything. Bitcoins only requirement is decentralization.
@_date: 2017-06-26 05:21:09
But the base layer should be antifragile and big blocks centralize. Transactions and experiments of all sorts can go on second layers and bloat them instead.
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:48:01
Nah. Ur just a vector of attack from profiteering miners buttcoiners and shitcoiners. You hit on the sacred concept of decentralization, and all because miner profits which should tend tp 0, are a bug not a feature. Yourchinacoin understanding of bitcoin is 0 and your crappy paypal ambitions are over 9000.
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:47:14
Oh so now fees are a good thing? The wambulance chinacoin clan should make its mind up.
