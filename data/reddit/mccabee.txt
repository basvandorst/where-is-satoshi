It does have a large importance in industry, computer chips, medical equipment etc. however I assume the majority of it goes into producing jewelry. Back to the point of people giving it value, 1000-2000 years ago gold had absolutely no practical use besides a form of payment people agreed on to make the exchange of goods easier. Too weak to produce weapons, no electricity yet, it looks pretty...

Good point, grandfather was a jeweler so I feel I should have known that lol. 20 year old 10k ring always looks worse than a 60 year old 18k one.

Polkit is more permissions gone awry. Redhat released a statement on it saying that the attacker would likely need access to the computer but could then just as easily reboot the box in recovery mode. It still poses come risks but not nearly as much as heart bleed or shellshock since not all linux kernels have it

Okay, forget the kidnapping. How much does Lindsay Lohan getting another DUI apply to anyone's lives?  The point is mainstream media is nearly always focused on the doom and gloom, the controversy and the sensational. Studies show that people who watch the most news are more likely to have a negative outlook on the world.

Thanks! I'll certainly give them a read. It is interesting/sad how the government has manipulated our money. Nixon dropped the gold standard to raise the national debt funding the Vietnam war while avoiding the possibility of any countries calling in our debt in the form of gold forcing them to only be able to take reserve notes. This all took place close to a decade after the second link you posted was written. I guess it's that old cliche if we don't learn from our mistakes we are doomed to repeat them.

Media always love a good panic causing sensation, how many times do you hear "white woman kidnapped, could your daughter be next?" Vs the NFL player who left a 34 million dollar contract to feed the homeless or someone doing good for their community?

"It" didn't get hacked. The blockchain which creates bitcoins is essentially a giant transaction history. Too long to explain. A btc exchange was hacked earlier this year yes. Hacks are nearly impossible to completely defend against, it just depends how big of a target you are and the reward for successfully hacking you. Sony has been hacked numerous times in the last couple years with devastating results, does that mean no one should ever buy a play station again? Same for Target. Of course gold is used as a hedge, USD, furniture and everything else is now being used as a hedge against roubles because the world market agrees they are with more. Read more about the history, development and all of that. I have no money in BTC I just follow because I find finance is interesting. For the BTC community as I see it, this is a time where they constantly feel on the defensive and questioning or derision of it causes great offense. Lurk more

Again thanks, I was obviously reading outdated information. Read up on bitpay and coinbase. The 1% fee is equal to or less than the fee of anywhere from 1%-5% for accepting various credit card transactions. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:43:26
Thanks, that pretty much blows most of the cons out of the water. That's one of the services I have not really read into yet. That was one thing I wondered why someone hadn't filled that gap yet. The article I read on coindesk about ways to convert btc to cash made no mention of bitpay. It only mentioned selling on an exchange, in person, or P2P where you give someone bitcoins after they purchase goods with cash.

How about we take all of this fervor and energy directed at paycoin/josh garza and turn it into something positive for bitcoin. I've never seen such a storm of posts about anything before. I understand paybase was a huge scam, a bunch of people got burned and we need to spread that information. Let's shift the focus from this con artist douchebag to something constructive. If you look at Great Auk Wireless(his former company) they have nothing but awful reviews. He can burn a few small towns in New England but this is far greater. He is a career con man, I assure you he will have his day when this all catches up to him. Look at how unified everyone is right now, let's take this same amount of energy and put it to use developing, innovating and sharing the amazing aspects about bitcoin with the public.

UN can do that, look at drugs. If you try to legalize(not decriminalize) drugs in your country where they can be sold to the public, the US will put on harsh economic sanctions, cut off any financial aid, or whip out a full blown trade embargo.  Put a strangle hold on any businesses finances based out of said country preventing money from entering or leaving the US.  They can't technically "stop" anyone from using it but they can make their lives a living hell until they do.

Of course people never listen. It's really sad, hubris and greed everytime. People tell themselves, "no this one is different," "I'll be able to see it coming and get out ahead," and "that will never happen to me." It's almost like crack or heroin, everyone warns you not to do it but you tell yourself "I won't be that homeless guy on the street, I know when to stop" and 2 years later they're broke and homeless. It's unfortunate but people will always make poor decisions no matter what  you tell them.

Make a few arrests that link terrorists to the use of bitcoins, seize any exchange that sold bitcoins to said terrorist, start a media shit storm destroying the publics view of Bitcoin. Pass legislation outlawing the use of ALL CRYPTOCURRENCY as an amendment to the PATRIOT Act. Put on a couple of show trials for money laundering and terror charges. Go to UN and pass an international law similar to narcotics legislation outlawing bitcoin in all UN member countries. Have the NSA specifically watch for internet traffic that matches bitcoin transactions. Send in Interpol for anyone still operating an exchange or mining and seize all equipment, extradite to US and send to prison for 20 years. It's obviously not destroyed it will just move underground but the view of crypto will be "terrorists and dopers use that GO 'Murica!!" And no legitimate business will touch it. However, if you just go after their money and shut down any exchange as a money laundering operation, there will be no place to cash bitcoin out and it loses it's value since you can't do anything with it.   
Edit: they essentially did this with online gambling by going into foreign countries like the Isle of Man, and New Zealand seizing websites, charging money changers with laundering and site operators with illegal gambling operations. With complete permission of the host country.   
Edit 2: bonus points if you call in Geraldo Rivera to do a Fox News Special Report on how "Your children are using bitcoins to buy drugs and it's funding ISIS"
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:18:17
About the only way they could possibly completely eradicate it is if tey brought it to the UN, and then had the FBI get involved then do what they did with online poker a few years ago. If they just went after any sort of exchange around the world and shut them down on money laundering charges no one would want to put their money at risk to be seized by the US govt. If they were to keep people from converting it to cash even 60-80% of the time, it would lose it value just because it's to risky to use.

Thanks! I figured I would try cause people keep saying "how can we better inform people about scams?" I figure an active area for open discussion is the best route. We can't rely on "journalists" anymore since so many allow the posting of paid articles and sponsorship from companies with bad reputations.

I'll be interested to see how long Microsoft plans on keeping 50% or whatever they claimed they would hold with this price slide. I haven't seen much besides saying they are expanding where they accept bitcoin so I have no idea if hodling is still on the table for them.

Basically said the same thing, if you link it to terrorism and go after it on that front you could pretty much destroy it in a month.

BTW lawyers have this thing called a DISCOVERY that lists all the evidence used to make an arrest against the defendant. The legal team goes through this and tries to find anything to help the defense such as violations if the 4th amendment, etc. the defense already knows what evidence they are up against, now it's up to them to attempt "jury, beyond a REASONABLE DOUBT, did my client pay for the murder of multiple people? Evidence points to DPR but can you say BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT that my client was DPR at that exact time? He may have been DPR in the beginning and end but was this HARMLESS NERD a certain dread pirate Roberts at the exact day the hit was ordered?" if they are admitting Ulbricht was a part of Silk Road they kinda know they're already fucked and will try to plea down to a lesser sentence.

As I said above I edited the pic to hopefully obfuscate any EXIF data that might come back to me. It's the same dark blue, I just cropped the personal info out and used software to put a gray filter over it. If you have IOS, check it out. To my eyes the blue on the app looks a little darker than on the regular CB site. It is mostly just a wallet with buy and sell features, none of the other stuff you find on CB.

It's not a problem, but you hit the nail on the head if you are just buying and holding bitcoin. There are exchanges with all sorts of features included like short selling, I've never been active in the exchange scene, so I wouldn't be of much help there. As far as Adsense goes I took over a website that my dad used to own. After it was hacked and he got tired of dealing with it, I took over cause I had started a blogger with Adsense in the past with little success. Turns out people don't want to read the bitchy poetry of a former heroin addict lol. But that's another story. I was lucky because it was already well established so I rode in on his coat tails. You need a website with content and google will review it to make sure it follows their terms of use and if you are excepted they will notify you. The easiest way to do that is create a blogger.com page  through a gmail account and use the monetize option since blogger is owned by google now they have it all built in. But you need a site that will draw people in order to make any money, if you just click ads on your site google will drop the ban hammer on you. Search "google Adsense" and "monetize blogspot" for more I depth info.

That's what I've been trying to do, I'm not exactly wealthy right now since I'm still in college and pull a little income from Adsense, eBay, odd jobs for neighbors and the occasional freelance web/IT stuff for friends. Splitting most of it between girlfriend expenses, the  bank and crypto until I can get a steady 9-5 and put more into BTC. I pretty much gave up on LTC and wishing I had bought into DRK when it was almost a dollar. DRK has been making crazy moves lately.
