oh boii better sell my bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:32:55
he is kinda right tho all those cryptocurencys that are made to be curencys will fail so unless your token has a use its going to go down to 0, bitcoin will be the one and only cryptocurency to be used in real world as a medium of exchange but once all these coins start going down btc will only go up because thats where they are going to run, in bitcoin i predict 100k by the end of the year and once lighting network starts working fine boy are wegoing to see some gains. also hers a tip HODL!! the banksters want to get in this game dont let them fool you and give u  their worthless fiat for your precious bitcoin just hodl till u can go to anystore out there and spend it 
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:43:48
why do u all even care about that old fuck im sure he needs all that paper to keep him warm where he is going but we got future infront of us and we dont need fiat there
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:23:59
idiots just keep nosing their head likea yeah yeahand they go whine about not having any money 
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:26:44
yeah stop being profitable if btc stay at 8 k lol, this isnt biased at all, just more fud on every corner once btc gets to a mill it gona be profitable and it will get to a milion trust me its just evolution of money nothing too hard to understand u cant expect the whole world to change and our monetary system to stay the same thats not how it works crypto is the future and bitcoin is the king end of story
@_date: 2018-05-03 12:03:28

@_date: 2018-05-03 13:49:39
i dont think machines will ever work for us like that i mean if everyone has it intheir home then how can it earn money for everyone? work made a man we will all beed to work but the diference is the average worker wont be exploited to the max like he is right now everyone should be able to afford a house a carand a vacation for his whole family and work only 6 hours a day max
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:30:13

@_date: 2018-05-04 00:06:29
oh my god thats it governments should detax everything paid with bitcoin it will make people use it thats 20% for everything u buy it will allso create a lot more money to be spent therefore inflating it more and speeding the procces of death of fiat but is it in governments interest? off it is but who runs the fovernments is it in his?
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:30:55
im dont care about the price man. yeah those too are smarter then average. as for the gold and silver its prety obvious god gave us that money usa fed is not god they cant print money end of atory they abused that power they are financing war and terror acros the planet the gap between rich and poor is insane milenials cant afford shit etc 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:46:31
btc doesnt even need money to work it just needs adoption and insee more and more stores accepting it every day 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:29:05
well for me he is 
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:23:08
nope btc will replace it banks were allready on their way to remove cash completly and use creditcards only so they can have full controll but btc fucks thwir plan up
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:59:51
if we people start buying prices will go uo noone can do shit 
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:14:38
even if that is the case its better then dollar 
btc is limited eventualy those adresses will have to give a lot of it away in order to buy stuff the only way for them to keep it is to have bussinesses and create jobs and thats not a bad thing
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:04:10

@_date: 2018-06-05 09:55:49
i guess hudge money is waiting for an entry point, maybe all these oump and dumps have a reason they want everyone to think that when btc gets to lets say 9 k it will go back to 7 in that way peoole will sell more and they will be able to get in cheaper 
@_date: 2018-06-03 11:03:44

@_date: 2018-03-31 22:18:54
because it will ruin thw banks and is not comercialized noone in the mainstream media or the tovernment is telling you go use bitcoin its better then fiat because its not in their interest u have to figure it yourself and force it upon these mafiosos
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:08:50
lots of people are buying btc because they like the idea not because of the money it is very young and will go up to 100-200k in a few years for sure 
@_date: 2018-03-25 05:19:42
uwant to say the fed is not printing money out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:10:37
i had this analogy how bitcoin and satoshi nakamoto are like jesus because bitcoin is going to free us all from the bankster scum so i guess he died today but soon he will resurect and fullfill the prophecy
@_date: 2018-03-31 22:40:37
im in to destroy bankster scum but its true i bought some btc directly from miners round here and from what i concluded they are iterested only in the money bunch of nerdy pussys if u ask me

@_date: 2018-04-15 23:32:35

@_date: 2018-04-17 21:53:06

@_date: 2018-04-29 21:40:00
well i bet ta enforced to the people unlike bitcoin bitcoin must be enforced on the governments by the people because it doesnt benefit them nor the banks and banks actualy controll governments most of the people are just dumb sheeps in the end we just have to wait and see but that was my opinion
@_date: 2018-04-14 13:30:34
its not socialism its usa
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:26:33
they are using the debth to controll the demand ao they can cobtroll the inflation by adjusting interest rates
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:39:52
btc is just like gold we just took everything thats good in cold and remove everyhing that is bad and we got bitcoin now we have no need to use this fiat based sustem that is proven itself to be very faulty and even shitty
