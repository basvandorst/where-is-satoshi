@_date: 2017-12-06 17:15:00
Bitcoin is arguably the most valuable asset in a ~$100 trillion market. It can easily capture 5%-15% of it... if it does we are looking at a market cap in the range of $4 trillion and $15 trillion. 
There are risks to bitcoin, but the upside is still insane. The risk-reward ratio still blows away any other asset class.

That is not how it works at all.
Bitcoin's plan for future scalability is also fundamentally different from what Bitcoin in the past. Core's persistence on limiting the block size to 1MB is a huge red flag. This is not only not sustainable, it is not supported by any comprehensive metric. Show me some numbers that support the idea that 2MB-4MB blocks would be detrimental to the network.
Bitcoin used to be great for transactions. It is no longer. It used to be great as an entry/exit ramp for fiat, and it is no longer. It used to be great for arbitrage, and it is no longer. This will have a direct impact in the brand and the network effect of Bitcoin. The bad user experience provides an incentive for investors to switch to a new crypto... trhere are some cryptos that are arguably technically better than Bitcoin, and others that may be worse, but provide a better user experience. This will have an impact in the price of Bitcoin. There is absolutely no guarantee that Bitcoin will retain its dominant position, and the leading reason that would cause it to fall is poor user experience caused by a slow/unpredictable network, expensive fees and/or over complicated usage when compared to other cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:57:10
I am not very knowledgeable, this is why I came here to ask the question. What I do know for sure is that if the cost of on-chain transactions stay above $1 then it will severely limit Bitcoin usage to participants in poor countries. The LN network exponentially scales the potential of the main Bitcoin chain, but that scaling it is still constrained by the block size. A synergistic approach appears to be the best solution.
@_date: 2019-07-09 15:41:24
The funniest thing is that the majority of the people here have no idea how and why other cryptocurrencies can also have value, what other uses cases are, and how some are arguably better than Bitcoin in many technical and practical aspects.

The median trx cost is now bordering $20. BTC is risking loosing interest from small investors. It is loosing support from vendors, and it will lose its position as the main entry/exit ramp between fiat and cryptos unless they bring those fees down and quickly. I want to know what on earth is preventing the block size from being increased to 2MB or even 4MB. I have not found a good post on this subject... and respectfully raising questions related to this have ended up with mods censoring new posts. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:38:15
Well, that maybe happening too. Lol. Fortunately futures should help reduce the volume of on-chain transactions. The LN better be ready soon, the lack of appropriate timeline is worrisome. In all honesty, I also can't fathom why they haven't increased the blocksize to 2MB - this would increase the cost of spamming the network, and it would dramatically reduce transactions cost. I have not seen ANY metric that supports the idea that 2MB blocks would cause a detriment to the network or the effectiveness of decentralization. Block sizes should be constrained by these factors, otherwise what is the reason to set limits?
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:39:47

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:49
There wouldn't even be a need to have this discussion if Bitcoin's devs had dealt with scalability issue in a sensible way. The bottom line is that it costs at least $15-$20 to make sure a transaction is included in the next block. This is utter shit, and it WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE PRICE OF BITCOIN. Many people here have been calling it for a long time, but the troll posse kept shutting down the argument. Well, congratulations.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:06:40
I agree, but here is a possible scenario:
Wallstreet players have been buying BTC recently in order to accumulated enough to sell it all after shorting on the futures market. This could shake up a bunch of real Bitcoin holders, thus driving the price even further down. They could then buy BTC once the price is in the gutter and close their contract positions. Voila... they have just made shit-tons of money at the cost of the little man.

Please show me the specific metrics that were used to determine 1MB blocks should not be increased to 2MB-4MB.

Here are a few reasons why it is "
* Bitcoin is the most secure digital ledger in the world. This is the most fundamental property of Bitcoin, and it is the core reason that enables it to fulfill all other qualities associated with it.
* The Bitcoin ledger operates with its own international currency: one that has limited supply with emission controlled by a transparent, immutable, mathematical formula.
* Bitcoin is trustless and permisionless and as such it is the only form of digital ledger that allows participants to hold assets and securely transact without the need of a third party.  This is an option of the system, however I am sure that traditional financial entities will operate with Bitcoin in the future for those who prefer to trust a third party with the burden of securing their assets.
* Once scaling solutions are implemented, the transaction cost of Bitcoin will be radically lower than of current digital currencies and assets.
* Bitcoin will provide financial services to the world's population who are currently unversed by traditional banking. The only requirement is a mobile phone with internet access.
* New generations will have access to Bitcoin before they have access to traditional banking. There will be little incentive for them to transition out of Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin fulfill its role, it can easily capture 5% of the global M2, and it would then be valued at over $300,000 per bitcoin. This can easily happen in the next 3 years.

To be honest I don't know all the details about how IOTA works. On the surface it sounds like it would be appropriate for a redundancy system. If the network fails, it just means that redundancy is lost and parties would have to rely on their own data management. 
I came here looking for an answer to how LN will secure transactions and implement redundancy. A system that does not have native redundancy implemented is very bad IMHO, but I would love to hear what the options are.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:53:46
The sole point of imposing a block size limit is to ensure the stability and decentralization of the network. Transaction fees should not be the focus of the discussion. The decision of block size should be use a number of comprehensive metrics to determine a reasonable limit, and allow small gradual adjustments to be made to block sizes (including the ability to reduce the block size).  This way the real world effects of a block size change can be observed and help devs to get a better understanding of the impact of the changes. 
Ultimately, the block size should increase as long as there is no detrimental effect to the network.

When the hell will the answer to this ever be a no? 
It does not matter who created a public blockchain, once the code is out there, it is available to anyone to adopt change and expand on it. Currently there is a group of people who is primarily responsible for the development of Bitcoin, and another group of people for the Lighning Network (which Bitcoin is heavily counting on for scaling)... so under your own definition, bitcoin is centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:40:10
Third point was referring to crypto in general. The rest of it is the answer to the current valuation of Bitcoin. Another important thing to consider is that Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first crypto and it has gained from the network effect and tons of exposure. It is very hard to take that away, but not impossible.

That's the only type of ETF that the SEC should approve for security issues related to theft and fraud. Anti-theft measures are going to be the desisive factor that will determine the degree of success of cryptocurrencies. Some of the characteristics of block-chain create technical issues that weaken the real value of cryptos. Scalability is the hot topic today, but fraud protection will become much more talked about in the near future. People need to be able to trust exchanges and online wallets, and for that to happen we will ultimately need a certain degree of government involvement aka SEC oversight. If the US is stupid enough not to pursue it, another country will... a good guess would be Switzerland. So, given our political status quo, we'll end up with Swiss backed exchanges and wallets. The Swiss might end up creating security measures that are external to the cryptocurrencies to accommodate for unresolved security risks. At the point the US could double down on stupidity and forbid US citizens from having accounts in foreign hosted wallets. I think this is very unlikely to happen, but then I need to remind myself that every other week we are breaking new grounds on political madness.

The choice will be made by individuals and businesses. Besides that, if the dollar is hit by strong inflationary pressure then it very unlikely it will continue to serve as a global reserve currency. If countries do not choose to officially adopt cryptos as the new their national currency, they will still have a very strong incentive to choose to allocate a chunk of their reserves as crypto.

It scales primarily based on Bitcoin's price. Price is very much influenced by the organic growth of the network. So, it is not a complete fallacy to say that energy consumption scales with the network because it is indirectly correlated to it.

Agreed, but if we want to be the bigger coin, than we must act like the bigger coin.

1. It is not sustainable, but core is not willing to compromise the integrity of the network to pursue scalability. 
2. Bitcoin is growing in popularity, and there are spam transactions that are making the situation worst. The solution is to scale via "layer 2" chains like the lightning network. It will take ~2 years for the lightning network to be live for Bitcoin interaction. 
3. Andreas agrees with prioritizing the security and distribution of the network. Bitcoin must me trusted and immune to censorship to serve as a store of value and ultimately as a medium of exchange - scaling by increasing the size of blocks would ultimately lead to centralization.

I agree that the current model for consensus will need to change in the long run, but its not that easy (specially if you are talking about switching off POW). Anyone can mine with a CPU/GPU, but it is not nearly as efficient when compared to specialized hardware built to crunch up a particular hash function (what is normally called ASIC - application specific integrated circuit). There are hash functions that are very complex, making it more difficult to create specialized hardware, but its hard to tell how effectively that would work. The recent Bitcoin Gold fork does just that: its a switch of hashing algorithm to use a ASIC resistant hash. Support stays with core, and will stay with core, until a real issue emerges that affects core where a fork is more resilient.

Under the assumption that current levels of decentralization and security are sufficient. With time there is progress with the different variables that are related to the ability to process bigger blocks. The variables are: the cost and availability of storage, memory, processing power and network speed. If all of these improve favorably over time then it is safe to assume that the network capacity can be increase while maintaining the same level of decentralization.

I am yet to see the model with specific metrics that was used to determine 2MB is the current appropriate block size. There is a LOT of room between not expanding the block size and indefinitely expanding it. What we don't need is more post like yours, that come here defending a conclusion without a single reference to a scientific model that can explain how and why the conclusion of 2MB limit has been reached.
What are the specific variables and constraints affecting storage, memory, processing power, network bandwidth and latency. Where is the model with actual numbers? Technology has evolved and has gotten cheaper in the past 10 years, and will continue to do so in the future. 
It is absolute nonsense to declare the blocksize should not be increased while all factors that drive the determination of its size are improving. How in the world will we know when and how much it is possible to increase the block size without a model?
Where is the model? Where is the model? Where is the model? Save yourself and everyone else from a pointless argument and and just present the freaking model.

The whole point of this post was not to advocate for bigger or smaller block size, but rather that we need a model to establish a comprehensive understanding of how the block size impacts network decentralization and security. Without a model you are arbitrarily picking the limit. 
You should also learn what a metaphor is.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:38:54


Thank you for proving the point of how mindless your reasoning is.
The value of Bitcoin is not only defined by how secure the network is. The cost per transaction is a factor that cannot be ignored and it is quite important for global accessibility and inclusiveness.
You are suggesting that that the estimation of block size is purely arbitrary - this is nonsense. What we are looking for is comprehensive understanding of how block size is correlated to network security. If we were blindly pursuing network security than we should indeed decrease the block size to virtually zero (and that is what it should have been from the start), but there is a balance between security and functionality that may dramatically improve one without compromising the other. There must be a basis to determine how severely changes in block size can affect network security.

The copied transaction would still be in the other chain's mempool. What happens when I broadcast a new transaction on that chain - wouldn't that automatically be rejected until the transaction in the mempool consuming the same input is confirmed? I don't understand the protocol well enough, but is there a validity check in the mempool, or is it possible to have 2 transactions with the same input in the mempool? In that case I supposed I could increase the fee of my side-chain transaction and hope that it would be confirmed before the fake one (that would still be a major pain).

I am a big fan of Andreas, but this interpretation of the LN security model is very disappointing. A LN transaction is NOT the same as a bitcoin transaction precisely because it has not been broadcast to the bitcoin network and therefore it is not replicated through an immutable network protected by massive redundancy. In addition, the channel must be actively monitored and ready to respond to a potential attempt to cheat.
The need for safekeeping of unpublished transactions, and the necessity to actively monitor and publish a transaction under a certain time constrain make the theoretical security of the LN inferior to Bitcoin.
