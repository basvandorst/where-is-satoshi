With all the news about exchanges screwing over users, and the philosophy of bitcoin in general... how the hell do people keep falling for the same trick over and over?
Bitcoin means that you control your money.
Bank means someone else controls your money.
Stop letting people control your money FFS

I'm not sure if you're referring to bitcoin userbase or reddit. But there are people who use bitcoin who don't even know reddit exists.

Can anyone answer the big question: will bitcoin be worth thousands if not millions of USD in the future? This is the only real interest I have in bitcoin besides buying drugs. like seriously.

I want to believe. I'll be following this for updates.

Problem with greece isn't banks or the government, its lazy idiots sitting around collecting welfare and getting angry when the government can't give them anymore welfare to sit around abe lazy. so natrually these people bite the hand that feeds them.

you must have been one of those people who were on welfare and had to get a job, sorry for your loss.

Bitcoin may not get much higher, but everything else will eventually get lower.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:24:31
Very true, but you can get a better idea anyway. 
My prediction is that either bitcoin is going to improve it's speed or become easier to use and become popular, or something that has those qualities will overtake it. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:20:31
I sorta feel that there is too much "hope" that it will be useful / successful though. Time will tell but I am one of the hopeful people.

this is terrible news, because they gave him that bitcoin so that he reports the app as trusted, It should not be trusted, several people have been scammed with this app. this post is not in good faith. ONLY USE TRUSTED APPS.
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:44:50
You have a good point. To add to that I'd say: Don't let your emotional attachment to a crypto-currency affect your ability to think rationally. Too many "believers" on this subreddit and not enough realists...
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:53:13
So apparently after looking at the reviews for this app it appears that many people have been scammed out of their bitcoin. the positive reviews are likely fake.
bitcoin wallet is the one I use and never had a problem with it.
Please read the reviews before you even download an app.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:50:00
Only Americans are allowed to have bitcoins. /sarcasm
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:36:58
we still mostly are against it in the U.S. But our government and main stream media is forcing it on us. as well as Hollywood. They are trying to make it seem acceptable.
@_date: 2016-06-16 22:08:54

Stop being an idiot, lesson learned: never ever trust anyone but yourself with your own money. they have no reason to give you money.

@_date: 2017-08-12 01:22:47
Please stop. Please go down. Please let me catch up so I can buy a whole bitcoin. PLEASE

if the c02 traps heat into the earth as it comes down - creating a greenhouse effect... why doesn't the same c02 BLOCK the sun from coming through in the first place? so wouldn't the amount of heat coming through be diminished in the first place?

yep, uneducated immigrants are gonna use a crypto- currency to send virtual money to even less educated citizens in a country with terrible infrastructure so they can better their lives in a country ravaged by poverty and death.

I actually watched someone cut open their sack and cut off a testicle, fry it and eat it, and believe me, you don't want to see that shit. it was very disturbing.

This is the area I really see bitcoin taking off. International payments. They are quicker than fiat (nearly instant) You can send as much as you want, and you can use an atm to get your cash or link your bank.
@_date: 2015-08-02 00:18:19
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:42:31
I would guess never. If you look at the trends of alt coins you can see most people will use the coin until it hits its peak, then they will dump it all and make a huge profit, the same thing happened for bitcoin. It's unlikely that will ever occur again unless someone shills a bunch of people into bitcoin. with how difficult it is to understand bitcoin, that's also unlikely.
We will see waves but not bubbles.

Don't ask, Don't tell. 
Unless you spill the beans you're buying bitcoins then you're screwed.
Say it's a gift and you won't have any trouble.

So what is the actual price of bitcoin at this time? I predicted it would fall about this much but I don't think its actually worth $2600 - taking any advice now, or i might just go out and buy now anyway
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:37:41
You could probably use this as a legitimate argument for going all in. There may be a day when fees are so bad that bitcoin simply isn't worth investing in. Anyone care to tell me why this is wrong? (I hope it is)
@_date: 2017-06-26 23:26:56
if you didn't predict this you don't know bitcoin well enough. I seen this shit a mile a way and now im buying like fucking crazy every time it drops. I'm not better than anyone by any means but i have been watching and learning for over two years now.
