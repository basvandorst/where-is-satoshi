But no whites “genocided” the original African inhabitants.

Pinapple is objectively superior to every other topping.

You may not have fully synced your Bitcoin Core client yet so it still has to download the rest of the blockchain.

No they didn’t, retard. You’re probably thinking of America.

Colour me surprised.

That is great news, but I hope Bitcoin doesn't get too large yet. We need much more accumulation before it becomes mainstream.

I bought 50 lottery tickets in 2012 and their value already peaked at 245k this year.

The best is to just do exactly the opposite of what TA tells you.

To be fair, they don't associate it with your email address, so your phone number can't be used as an identifier. They definitely store your phone number on their servers though.

All the currencies you mentioned besides Bitcoin are shit and can’t scale without becoming centralized.

Developing LN and encouraging merchant adoption doesn’t risk decentralization.

Noobs won't necessarily be able to tell the difference between the tickers. They just see "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Core" and they buy "Bitcoin" when in reality they're getting Bcash.
They may also then send it to a BTC wallet, which will lead to a loss in funds if it's a segwit address.

Did you just write this comment to purposefully make r/bitcoin users look bad? Your argument that Satoshi didn't invent Bitcoin to be Paypal 2.0 doesn't make much sense, especially within the context of the submission you're commenting under.

Thanks for the red circle! I wouldn't have noticed it otherwise.

There is definitely some kind of astroturfing campaign going on. Even on other forums like /biz/ on 4chan, there has been a sudden, massive influx of Bcash shillers recently.

Of course they were scammed if they were deliberately misled into buying the wrong coin. What you perceive as good investment advice doesn't excuse what Bitcoindotcom is doing.
