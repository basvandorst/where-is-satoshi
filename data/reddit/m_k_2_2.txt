No need to buy in all at once. Dollar cost average (Buy lesser amounts monthly to get the average price). Then you won’t worry about buying high/low.

Stock prices are based on how much someone is willing to pay for that stock. Market return is the return on the underlying stocks that make up the market you’re looking at i.e. S&amp;P 500 is made up of 500 large companies in the US. I assume you’re saying the people that sold their bitcoin for large profits either bought enough goods/services to drive up the values of those companies, or they directly invested their returns in the market, which would in turn drive up prices.  Since there are two sides to every transaction, a buyer and seller, one side will lose while the other wins. Wealth was not necessarily generated from Bitcoin but redistributed. The money used to buy bitcoin was money that was taken out of the market. The buyer used money that either came from the market or is no longer able to be invested in the market while the seller can now use that money to purchase goods/services, save, or invest the monies back into the market. This would result in a zero sum gain. Also, as a previous comment pointed out, bitcoins market cap is in the billions while the market is trillions. I would not think that bitcoin/crypto would drive market prices up. I would think that as bitcoins price rises, more investors may move their wealth to bitcoin, which could have a negative impact on the market.

Bitcoins market cap is 180 billion. The US debt is around 20 trillion. That’s 20 thousand billion...
