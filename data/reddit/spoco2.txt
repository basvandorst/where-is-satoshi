Bingo. I'm really tired of the Bitcoin faithful going:
"It's not really confusing"
"Yes, yes it is"
"Ok, fine, it's confusing, but it's early days, it'll get better"
"But it's confusing NOW"
It's the same as Linux acolytes trying to convince people that command line is *so* much easier.
People who love Bitcoin HAVE to accept that right now it's a pain in the butt to use, and is scary to use because it's confusing as to just what's going on.
People shouldn't HAVE to understand about all the inner workings, but at the moment they're somewhat forced to.

I do torrent. But I don't think those who upload things should be paid for their services... that's taking something that's at heart a community of people sharing to actual criminals making money via stealing other people's work.
When someone starts making money from it, it stops having any sort of high ground at all and should absolutely be prosecuted.
It's the same as the dicks who make pirate DVDs and Blu-Rays and sell them at markets... you're making money from other people's work.

Holy shit... I thought that was going to be some simple explanation (because it's meant for a five year old, and because it has pictures)... but NOPE, it's pages of guff.
If you need PAGES to explain the basic concept, it's too complicated, you've failed, try again.
(I'm not saying Bitcoin has failed, I'm saying this explanation has failed.)

I too have just jumped into the waters, although I've started with way less than you, and only currently have 0.0985... 
In the week I've had it the value has gone up though :P
