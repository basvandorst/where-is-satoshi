Trump defunded the Financial Protection Bureau. Concerning them with this is a waste of time; the present presidency doesn't care about consumer protection. The bureau is essentially defunct - 
Even more reason to be very cautious with where you keep your crypto. If something goes awry, THIS administration - which values corporate profits over consumer protection - is certainly not going to help.

Typical right-wing rhetoric.
I'm sure you think this is fine:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has quietly dropped an investigation into a payday lender that contributed to Mick Mulvaney’s campaigns.
Mick Mulvaney is the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Embarrassing that you're on the side of payday lenders over the American public. But then again, you are a Trump supporter, so not too surprising.
Hmm... I wonder why this is:




I'm sure there's no conflict of interest that will encourage Mulvaney to lax regulations on payday lenders and other predatory scams. /s
Face it: your daddy Trump favors billionaires over the majority of the country, and his eradicating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is one of many examples, in addition to appointing a boatload of Goldman-Sachs execs and modifying the tax code so that the wealthy are the enormous beneficiaries.

A lot of people investing in crypto are first time investor, who haven't even so much as gambled, so they don't know anything about bankroll management.

guessing you have reading comprehension issues, considering I clarified that I was new in the first two words of my post. not sure why you even bothered to ask the question.
your pretentious attitude directed at me simply for not knowing much about Bitcoin is fucking hilarious tho. great way to treat those willing to learn more, considering that public interest in Bitcoin has an impact on its value.

noob question: is there any remote possibility bitcoin's value soars again? Or is it expected to hover around the same value and just keep dropping gradually as it has been?
Just by the looks of it, the value is in decline with no hint of a recovery. So I'm assuming Bitcoin's primary value to speak of in 2015 is its role as an immediate transaction tool (sell, convert btc to $, put in bank account) as opposed an actual investment opportunity?
