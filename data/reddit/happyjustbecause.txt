Can somebody ELI5 to me why people get so worked up (and scared?!) By altcoins? Are they bitter for not investing in ltc, doge...  Seriously I don't get it, I mean if Bitcoin is superior in its design, it is always going to win in the long run, right? especially with such a big head start.

Looking for a serious answer,
What if I find a USB stick in a landfill site with 1 BTC on it, do I need to pay taxes on that as I spend it?

Ahh, OK that makes sense. So if I find it on a day when bitcoin is worth $500 how much % tax do I spend on each purchase?
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:47:04
How much, theoretically, would I pay?

10 = 1 Gigoshi
1 = 1 Bitcoin
0.01 = 1 Megoshi
0.00001 = 1 Kiloshi
0.000001 = 1 Hectoshi
0.0000001 = 1 Decoshi
0.00000001= 1 Satoshi

I bought a small pack of batteries off amazon through these guys, though I haven't heard anything from them for about a week.  Have you bought from them before?

Since the value you exchanged is not astronomical, I would not worry about this too much.  Just sit tight and you will probably find in a few years that this has been a good investment.

I, for one, welcome our new bearish antagonists.  They bring balance to a somewhat one-sided sub.

Also, these inputs can be used to provide entropy for generating very random addresses.

Bitcoin-Killer, eh? Goodness, sounds scary, I wonder if they will release the source code?

Another interesting thought: of the 11 million or so bitcoins out there, many have been irreversibly lost due to neglect or carelessness and as such we are valuing the market cap on both 'known' and 'lost' coins. Does this mean the market cap is valued too high or too low? If coins are lost, do they still contain value? I suppose they do make the remaining coins worth more...

Does anyone else think Bart Chilton looks like a Marvel movie supervillain?

Brings a whole new meaning to [this.](

How much did you pay?
