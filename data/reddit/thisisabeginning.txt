They pumped the crypto price. They launched a futures market. They shorted the market. They sold their crypto and drove the price down just before contract expiration. 
They profited by the pump as new investors piled in. 
They profited from the dump with the expiring contracts. 
Classic pump &amp; dump in an unregulated market whilst also profiting in the regulated market that’s tied to the unregulated. 
Probably a one time profit event as they’ll ban regulated markets being tied to unregulated markets. 
In addition, the huge price drop may actually damage the banks providing the backing to the contracts as they’ll have to cover any excess beyond the agreed drop which I think was 30%.
But if all they need to do is print more fiat to cover the loss, all the better for BTC. 
This war has only just begun. Who will win? Fiat or Crypto?

This is just like when the powers that be decided to crack down on illegal music and video downloads....Sure a few people wanted to be ‘good’ netizens but it didn’t stop people using BitTorrent and co.  And this news is hardly going to stop some people using wallets and exchanges that couldn’t give 2-sh1ts about kyc rules. Sure most people will want to be good btcizens and will stick by the rules. 
So I read this as greater credibility given to cryptos and not as a locking down of cryptos.

That saving plan calculator is HorseS. If you have enough coins, draw down enough (max 1/3) to change your life for the better like buying a house in full then maintain the rest like a normal investment plan. If you haven’t got enough, then look at it like any investment. 
Also, you aren’t investing in a company. You’re investing in a collective ideal that you are part of. If you want your ideology to grow you must do what you can to help it grow. Encourage use and adoption of BTC.  
I’m in a similar boat. I drew down recently to cover the entirety of my initial investment. 
My next draw will be to buy a house. 
Then my plan will be max 3% per annum used for  broadened investment only. Eventually to have a spread of investments with BTC hopefully on the moon that everyone considers it cash so then it becomes a case of ‘why hold cash when you can invest it?’

If you want to know what happens when a coin is discovered to be a fraud just look at the history of other coin frauds. First the exchanges start to delist the coin. Then fud machines ramp up to claim everything is A-ok so that those who see the coming fail can dump as much of the shitcoin onto unsuspecting mugs. Then the truth outs and the media goes into overdrive of how bitcoin is a scam. The speculators dump. The HODLers HODL together. The smarts buy the dip. 
Oh, and if any exchange has been denominating their USD holdings in tether then they’ll probably collapse only furthering the need for decentralised trustless exchanges.

I'm totally with you on that and at one point I had 150BTC. Recently I just got scammed by the TON.ico out of a good portion of my remaining BTC. Just HODL onto that 1.5 to stay in the 21million club. It's only money and it cost you next to nothing in 2012. The only way we can give the final middle finger is if enough of us HODL until we reach a currency parity. There's a world currency war going on and crypto only joined that war 9 years ago.

Thanks for the post. The point of a hardware wallet is that you don’t have to keep it in a safe. If someone finds it, entering an incorrect pin 4 times locks it out and the keys are encoded on-chip so unrecoverable. It’s the seed that matters and you should keep two copies in two separate places so that fire and theft become irrelevant. I feel for you. I’d be so pissed about it. I’d be doing what I can to find the coins. I’d even bribe a police officer to help you find it in exchange for a big reward if the loot is still there. Or get a good PI on the case. It is possible you were robbed because of your own loose lips online. If that’s the case and you were specifically targeted then I’d say they are long gone. You should report this to the cyber crimes department in your country as they may also put a track on your coins or have a better idea on recovery. It’s also part of your insurance claim so make sure they include it.

Did exactly the same. Learned about bitcoin in 2011. Found it complicated and thought it’d never take off. Deleted 200BTC. 2013 comes and price is going crazy! Buy in 850+ and buy mining rigs. Got scammed out of a rig. Lost loads of the BTC trying to daytrade then price crashed just after I sold the mining rigs that I figured would never make a return at 90% efficiency. 
HODL’d what remained and fell asleep until 2017. Quick deep learning - Wow so much has changed! Amazing! Exciting! Cash out some, lose lots to the TON scam, put some into ALTS(f’ck). Now HODL’ing again. Slipping back into a coma. Will see you all again in 2022 at $100k hopefully.

There are 3 types of Crypto users:
HODLers: those holding for the long run. They are the ‘store of value’ users - Gold bugs. 
SPEDNers: those who see and perceive utility in bitcoin. Currently the biggest space for this has to be illicit uses but with greater utility and ease of use along with stability brought about by long term HODLers this will increase into your coffee shops. 
SPEUCLators: Those trying to profit from the liquidity fluctuations which right now presents huge opportunity if you know what you’re doing. If you don’t then you’ll quickly exit claiming bitcoin is a scam and watch from the sidelines.
All 3 are essential for any successful currency. If you can’t see that then you’re not seeing the bigger picture.

Upvoted for the etymology. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:40:33
As the BitConnect scammers cash out of their BTC into fiat(because they only see BTC as a scam itself) and the TON scam also cashed out in BTC and ETH along with the timing of the S. Korea ban scam (nice payout for those officials) all have driven the BTC &amp; ETH / fiat price. 
Consequentially, since alt coins are tied to BTC or ETH typically, there will be a panic flight from the ALTs into the core BTC &amp; ETH. So even though the price of the ALTs will go down in comparison to Fiat since the price of BTC/ETH goes down, they will also go down faster as the capital flows out into BTC.
In addition, those who can’t, don’t want to or try to maximise will also move from BTC into the lowest decreasing peg so with the announcement of BCD(Diamond) announcing its wallet some are transferring from BTC into BCD. However the meteoric rise in BCD can easily collapse as those with BCD cash out whilst the flight in is happening. 
All fun and games in cryptoland.

I suppose if a government like Venezuela specified that its oil can only be bought with bitcoin and specified the price per barrel to say 90uBTC (the equivalent of currently $0.09 and far below USD barrel price) then you’d get a flood of demand for Venezuelan oil with arbitrage causing a net demand of BTC. The Venezuelan Government would effectively be dictating the value of Bitcoin until another country does the same. It would drive BTC into the hands of the Venezuelan Government and drive competition. This is exactly how the USD have created their demand by pegging the USD to Oil purchases.

True: those who have coins and are spending it for fiat will drive the price down as general investors have low periods but it’s adoption, utility and reach that will drive price back up. As price goes higher more people will accept payment in bitcoin. Once people stop converting it back to fiat, the value remains locked in.

This is not buying a house in bitcoin. Just because you gave it to someone who converted it to shitty fiat doesn’t mean you bought a house for bitcoin.

I did laugh... But I also see how it's confusing. Think of it this way: Imagine there was only one cake in the whole world. The cake is about 12" wide and 3" deep but everyone wants a piece of the cake because the cake is super special and people have decided that cake is what we will use to transfer value between one another. If the cake then has value it is determined by the demand for the pieces of that cake. The more cake you have the more value you hold. So go get some crumbs.... Also, every now and then someone makes an ALT cake, keeps half of it and runs a marketing campaign telling everyone to use their cake instead so they can sell their shit cake as fast as possible. Don't buy into these cakes. Also, everyone loves cake. ;)

To a degree I agree but I think this is more of a semantics challenge. The broker is an intermediary facilitating the transaction and is not the vendor. 
I’d say purchaser paid using bitcoins but that the house wasn’t purchased with bitcoins as the vendor of the house did not receive bitcoins for the house. The broker facilitating the transaction made a conversion of currency for the house which was denominated presumably in Fiat instead of BTC. 
In my mind a true purchase of anything in bitcoin has to be when the vendor and purchaser utilise BTC without any intermediary conversion.

Amazing response. Yes I agree that tokens will form a basis as an on-ramp for utility to ‘The one crypto’ but I have doubts about localised or alternate currencies being necessary once you have side chains and layer 2 apps. For a long time many businesses continued to run competing network protocols like ARP NET, MS NET, APPLE TALK etc but in the end we all agreed on tcp/ip even though it could be thought of as lesser than some other protocols. We built on that foundation and rejected attempts at centralising and controlling the base protocol. I’m sure there’s still some alternative networks running in some buildings/across businesses to serve niche purposes but it’s just not widely adopted. Vis-a-vis crypto.

If you see BTC as an asset class rather than functional money then I’d agree with your assumption. But let’s say you’re young and you’ve received your salary in BTC for the last 5 years and that over that time your BTC cash has appreciated in value. You want a house to own simply for the pleasure of owning a home. What are your options then? Ideally you’d want to exchange a house for your BTC without having to consider putting it through another currency first. 
Also taxes are paid in what ever is the local requirement which for Florida I believe they are considering payment in BTC.

This guy gets it. Shorting the market is like placing a bet. You’re betting the market will go down. And if it does go down your call on the short drives further downward pressure. But there comes a point where the lower the price the greater the buy-in demand. 
But if you want to put the conspiracy hat on here is what they can do: buy loads of the currency, put short sells in place, sell the currency to drive price below your short sell, win on the short sell, buy the panic dip, rinse and repeat. 
Only so often can you do that but each time they do they’ll have added liquidity and capital into the currency market because you’ll always get a net of hodlers waiting for the return and happy to risk certain amount of capital. 
Then again if everyone lost trust in the currency that would drive the price to zero. The fundamentals are what matter. 
What you’re talking about simply isn’t possible otherwise you would have seen them do it to other countries currencies already.

Oh dear. Seems like you want to use the offensive tactic of trying to hurt my 'feelings'. Boohoo....
It is nothing like the ocean. 
Imagine everyone were to trade coffee beans for wheat in a closed room. There's a hundred people in there. For the sake of simplicity, there are only 100 people in the universe. 
They all overhear each other in this room and what the price is typically trending as so its reflected quickly in the market. But lets say that a guy called Bob meets brucejennerleftovers and says 'Hey Bruce... I've got a huge stash of beans that I want to get rid of but I cant tell anyone about it because I kinda found it. Are you interested in buying? I'll give you a big discount. ' Thus a deal is struck off market without affecting or flooding the main market price. 
Later, instead of flooding the market with his fresh cheap beans, Bruce decides he wants to maximize his profits from the cheap stock he bought. So he uses his awesome wealth to go into the market and buy everything up as quickly as he can. Everyone sees this and thinks woah! What does Bruce know that we don't? Lets get into that shit and buy us a shit ton of these beans!!". 
Meanwhile, Bruce has a friend quietly selling his cheap stock into the market Bruce has been inflating. They maximize their profit on the cheap off-market stock. Then Bruce starts to sell the stock hes been buying up to inflate the market while the frenzy continues. If he plays his cards right he'll create profit on that stock too. All in all, Bruce walks away without owning any beans and now has a shit ton of wheat. 
Because at the end of the day you can make bread with wheat and live, but you can't live off coffee.
And that is how the markets work just on a much bigger and convoluted scale. 
Insults not required.

I'm just going to posit that as more miner manufacturers enter the mining space (thus driving price competition on the mining machines as currently the demand outstrips the supply so the cost can somewhat dictate the price of bitcoin) and as more individuals buy a miner to run in the background (thus driving the cost to mine higher than it's possible to make a return and decentralising hash power further) that large mining farms will become a thing of the past as they'll be uneconomical to run. What's essential is to have more choice of mining pools to maintain decentralisation.

Name calling.. Classic Astroturfing. Yes I have heard of Invisible hand. Buying OTC does make a difference since you won't be bulk buying all the micro sell or buy orders. You'll be market matched to individuals who will pair well. Thus you'll be doing a trade that doesn't wipe out the market depth on an exchange and having other exchanges reflect that through balancing. Long term your price will be reflected in the market but not in the space of a few minutes which is exactly the type of manipulation the OP is talking about. If there was no OTC benefit, there would be no need for an OTC market. The benefit is that you get the best price without immediately affecting the market with your order.

r/btc should be reserved for BTC discussion... the currency code for the crypto currency known as Bitcoin. (Not Bitcoin Core. That’s another altcoin. You can look them up now)
 r/bitcoin is for discussion of the protocol and its development. like second layer developments, side chains and lightning. Anything that ‘benefits’ bitcoin movement and adoption.  
Want to talk Bitcoin Cash price moves? Head over to r/bch where it belongs. 
Want to talk developments in bitcoin cash? Maybe r/bitcoincash if it exists.

I can appreciate the investigation could have far reaching consequences but to say bitcoin has no utility is a bit ridiculous. It’s also acting like the reserve to other cryptos so as it’s price fluctuates so does the other cryptos. 
What is frustrating is that banks are simply being anticompetitive and stoping fiat being transferred to exchanges. If they allowed free flow bitcoin would rise hugely.

I believe OP has seen the bcash propaganda hit piece video on bitcoin and has probably hung out in the BTC sub so he’s been somewhat brainwashed but is still on the fence because he needs some objective responses to confirm the ‘feeling’.
There’s a good response video with twitter responses calling out the bs from the video. Perhaps someone can link to it. There does need to be a more thorough debunking video to call out the bs from the bcash community (heavily marketed by those who would benefit most).

Two things for me: the graphic he used is a misnomer in that you can’t consider it a store of ‘value’ unless it has been used as a means of exchange and you can only consider it a unit of account if it can be considered to be used for exchanging ‘value’. It’s the reverse and so far bitcoin has the math to be considered as a unit of account, has been trusted to be used for exchange of value and is now beginning to demonstrate its ability to be a store of value as demonstrated over 9 short years. I think it took a lot longer to convince people to accept gold as a currency/store of value. 
Lastly: the eventual result will be that they are forced to integrate as regulate and isolate are both methods of restraint that will buckle under the weight of fiat currency manipulation + continued erosion of trust in central banks. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 08:52:22
ETFs don’t help bitcoin as there is no immediate obligation to settle or hold the underlying asset therefore the trading is happening ‘off-chain’ so to speak. This only helps institutional investors protect themselves from the price swings. It can also allow them to short the ETF thereby driving an artificial price metric that others will measure by irrespective of the actual demand.

I invested a good portion of my wealth in 2013 when it was peaking at $1200 then it tumbled to $300 and stayed that way for years. But I believe in the potential for the tech. I’m not in it to get rich although that is going to be a welcome benefit. I’m in it for the huge social benefit it will bring to every single person on this planet. Including those without tech. It will restore trust in money. 
So Hodl my friend. Hodl. If the experiment fails you’ll still be able to hold your head up high and say ‘I participated. I stood up to bring us freedom. I risked and lost but I stood for what I believed in. I am no fool. I am a warrior who stood by my btc-brothers to fight the evil tyranny that we now stand in’.
And if it succeeds you can help those around you and those you love because you’ll have some of that redistributed wealth.

There are two options here: Either this is a clever deception to attempt reverse psychology and take ownership of bitcoin whilst simultaneously destroying it or DHS really did fund the production of Bitcoin. 
Anyone with half a brain can see that this was created by a well managed and secretive group and given the dollar is about to pop it makes sense to create something like this as a continuity of monetary control. 
Either way, the fundamentals of bitcoin remain regardless of who created it. After all TCP was created by the military to transmit information.  PGP was created by MI5. So this makes perfect sense and Infact if proven that it was created this way only strengthens bitcoin fundamentals.

Take away the credit and property prices fall into fundamentals and not available ease of credit supply. Ie lending to dumb asses that can’t possibly pay it back...
Fundamentals: building cost, land cost, location demand, desirability. 
If fewer people can buy because they don’t have access to cheap lending then the demand will be lower and so the fundamentals will reflect a price closer to its true value.

Sadly Ver and Wright see themselves as successful entrepreneurs. But they are only successful in as far as riding the train early on. They think the success is down to them. It wasn’t. So they need to prove it to themselves by doing what they think they already did. They’re chucking lots of money at it to give the perception they’re succeeding. There is some merit in what’s being said about big blocks but it doesn’t really solve the problem. Only a band aid. And that is what Satoshi would say. He’d say, ‘consensus has spoken’.

Question is...why would they allow it on a major network show? Just 5 minutes of effort would reveal this scam. Clearly the headline coming in a few days/weeks is how it was a scam and how bitcoin is bad. They are literally promoting this scam on a major tv network show and the result is people will lose real money.

Greed...The all powerful motivator of the banking system that will prove to be its ultimate demise.

Exactly this. The bankers sitting in their ivory towers receiving large bonuses enabling them to buy houses that seem ‘affordable’ to them cannot comprehend why the average salary in the U.K. of £26k is putting pressure on individuals with rampant inflation and house prices averaging well above £300k in metropolitan areas. Yeah sure....the economy works just fine if you’re in the banking industry. Just perfect. Idiots. The system is imbalanced in every nation. It’s time to re-balance that bullshit.

How the F is it controversial? It’s a block explorer for bch masquerading as an explorer for BTC. There’s nothing controversial about it what so ever unless you’re sucked into the whole BCH conspiracy.
