I have like .011 bitcoins in a wallet (using multibit wallet) that I have no idea how (or if) I can somehow change into real money. Tried sending it a few times, each failed. On top of that, Whats this transfer fee? I don't remember it back when I minded the coins and bought a hard drive with it.

That site just got me back one of our clients data (over 5 yrs of family photos) but in this case, it will not work. They just got hit with cryptowall. They have most of their stuff in backups, and unaffected files, but their is some picts that got hit. Those picts are part of an potential costly lawsuit.

My client want to buy it by C.C. but it sounds like all the services he/and my coworker have found takes a few days.

And when the end of bitcoin mining comes, how is the blockchain validation going to continue? 
And for a bonus that I have never been answered, Why do I need an online service to hold my bitcoins? Why can't I use my bitcoin wallet?

Has anyone tried this service to get a little bit of free bitcoins? Can you cancel the sms txt that they sign you up for?
