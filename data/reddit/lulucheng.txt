I usually watch the market using the coinbase app, i start mining when the price is up and hold off when the price is down. 
That said, i could lose it all and not really be upset (as it was just a few hours of my time at best, and even then it was in the background while i still did my normal daily things). I think i'll keep a close eye on the price as it falls and climbs and wait until it's at a steady pace enough for me to start mining again. 
I'll do more research into a hard wallet, thanks for the heads up!

Unskilled i may be, but you were unskilled too, I have to start somewhere. 
And i'm not looking to make a profit, electricity where i live is cheap and i don't pay for it. I already have an alright rig, it's shit when compared to others but it'll do. I'm just looking to make enough to buy a game or two every month (Like a neat indie game), maybe the odd Amazon purchase every once in a while. 
By no means should you treat me as a "miner", because it's just hobby. It's just easier to use as a blanket term.

Instead of being rude, could you please refer me to a mining related sub? 
As far as the sub rules go my question is perfectly fine as I'm asking about Bitcoin.

Nope, didn't even know that it was a thing. Most of my knowledge comes from experience and whatever explanation I could find.

Oh, so that's what happened. 
I was mining about 1$ worth of bitcoin last month before dropping it for awhile, went back to it to see how it was going and was only pulling in 50¢, i was wondering why.

I would if i could, but i am nothing but a broke rural teen who's testing out a hobby. I just think the technical aspect of it all is neat, its like a p2p network of digital currency (If my understanding is correct, i know it isn't a 1:1 comparison, but it's how i make sense of it in my head). 
My plan right now is to mine some then start the buying and selling game when i land a job.  
And if i can help out, i'll do my best! Many thanks!

Oh, I've been there, they were nice.

I usually get about 50¢ to a 1$ a day (depending on how it's doing) using my GTX 960 SSC, but to be fair i don't pay for my electricity. 
I'm interested in mining Altcoins, but i don't really have the know-how to scout them out. Not to mention my wants are more immediate than what Altcoin mining can provide. It's a great investment sure, but i don't think it's really all that good for me just yet.

Neat, sounds like a smart guy who didn't expect it to blow up like it did. 
I wonder if he/she ever meant for it to become the powerhouse like it did?

By no means am i troll, i'm just trying to figure out what's going on before i do anything that would be deemed "Stupid". 
I know my word doesn't mean much to you, but even if you don't believe me it doesn't hurt me. I'm just a simple wanderer trying a new hobby.

I already have an initial investment (My computer rig that i use for gaming and general browsing). I know it doesn't make much sense but i'm mostly going from 0$ because it's really just a hobby. When someone accepts me for a job (most of my peers have taken all the fast food/cart pushing jobs so my best bet it to just wait for one of them to quit unfortunately) i'll start buying bitcoin, but for now i'm stuck mining what little bits i can.
