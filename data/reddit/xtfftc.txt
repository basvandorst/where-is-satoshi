You are responsible for protecting yourself, but spreading awareness so that others take note of dangerous practices can also improve the overall situation a bit. Nothing wrong with this.

Spotify don't pay nearly as much to independent artists as they should. You should be giving Bandcamp your btcs, not Spotify. :)

Mostly because it's whole purpose is to be funny/do-goody. Nothing wrong with that but it won't necessarily work with a 'serious' currency like bitcoin.

Companies such as Apple will never be a part of the solution.

Spotify has different deals with different labels: major and indie. The majors have shares in Spotify - and it just happens so that they get a better deal.

Wasn't that like four months ago?

Again, services like Bandcamp. Many labels and artists put their records on there with a "pay what you want" price. And even those who have a fixed price have the album available for streaming for free. So you check it out, decide if you want to pay something to the artist, and do so. 
Unfortunately, the payment is done through Paypal, but hopefully they will add bitcoin as an option soon.

Don't count on it, the City is just as corrupt.

Agreed... But I don't see how this is related to what I'm saying :)

Plenty of examples, [here's one](

Sigh... Even more similarities between governments, East and West, "left" or "right".

Just as New York.

In case it was not clear: indie labels get a different deal. So indie artists - who are, naturally, on indie labels - get paid less. 
Everyone has issues with the way Youtube pays royalties. The difference is that Youtube is not heralded as a saviour from piracy when it's actually just a way to redirect revenue from the small labels to the big ones.
Here's some reent news regarding a declaration made by some of the most prominent indie labels:

Curious why they are asking for a fair deal if Spotify's deal treats them well and there are "massive flaws" in the argument against it.

But that's only going to be the cast as long as cryptocurrencies are just a novelty used by a small group of people. And I'm pretty sure the point is to get ordinary people involved.

While artists should definitely use bitcoin, it wouldn't necessarily change the artist/label dynamic.
There's some amazing platforms such as Bandcamp that allow artists an easy way to monetise their music, so even those who don't want/don't know how to publish their music online can do it now. But many (most) of those artists still have labels because labels do much more than sell your stuff. There's much more to the process than this.
But bitcoin (just like Bandcamp) can be yet another step in making artists and labels more independent. 
P.S. We should totally encourage Bandcamp to start acceptin bitcoin as soon as possible. It already is a groundbreaking service in terms of their model. They pay a much higher percentage to the artist than big label services such as Spotify or big corp services such as itunes do; they provide DRM-free music; they support many different formats (FLAC and ogg anyone?); etc.

I found it pretty despicable even though it's also predictable.
