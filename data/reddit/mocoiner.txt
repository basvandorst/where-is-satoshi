It is very doable. Check out BTCPay. It has pretty much everything you need.  
Setup takes seconds.

I think Libra is pretty much toast as far as something that will challenge Bitcoin. Mnuchin said repeatedly that Libra is a no go in his book. Other people and politicians have said the same. It Libra does become real, it will be neutered and regulated to such a degree that it will be akin to buying gift cards.

It's Bitcoin not Crypto, but anti-bitcoin Armstrong always tries to tell people otherwise. 
Trust him like you trust Ver - they are anti-bitcoin and always will be.

This is an alt-coin post spreading Armstrong's push to promote alt coins against bitcoin. Should be downvoted.
No criticism of op. The message sounds positive for bitcoin. But it is Armstrong's always ongoing attempt to promote alts and hurt bitcoin.

Thx OP. Very true, except Bitcoin not crypto.

1) Fees are $0.05. Use a good fee estimator for now: 
2) Use L2 in the future for almost no fees

Bitcoin (either on the base layer or on layers above) can and will do anything that can be done with cryptocurrency. 
Anything worth doing will be an attribute of Bitcoin's stack.

That's a bit harsh. I think he was saying that even with a limited understanding of bitcoin, one can see and know enough to know why Bitcoin is the future. And at that moment and ever after, you want more.

Excellent. Looking at this list and the main thought is that the value of all of these currencies is unstable, because their supply has no cap and no firm rules.
This is nominated for best new Bitcoin site of 2019!

Should be fine. Addresses don't change, they remain. But the wallet may display/provide a different receiving address each time you go to receive funds. This helps increase anonymity. All addresses should be tied to the same master key/wallet.

This is for currency exchange, BTC to EUR? Very cool. Very big adoption step.
The day will come when there is no need to convert from BTC, and this is a step towards that.

The SEC wants to hear from us on this. Give them your voice.

Sending bitcoin out of cashapp (withdrawing to a BTC address) is sending bitcoin from one address to another, and that is not a sale and is not a taxable event.
If you sell/convert the bitcoin to another currency, that may be a taxable event, but moving is not.

The SEC is running out of reasons to say no. and having the ETF actually functioning in the real world, even to limited audience, will give further momentum for approval.
Wondering if this was coordinated with the SEC - if they recommended it as a next step towards approval.
Will be curious to hear [ take on this later today.

Cobra has been a shill for Bcash and should be removed from bitcoin.org. 
On ex: 
Just search him on twitter for plenty more of his shady vacillations.
Fortunately he does not have sole control of bitcoin.org and cannot sell out to Ver.

The VanEck people are hoping we comment as well.
Look at this tweet yesterday from their head guy on this...saying "strength in numbers" and a link to the doc:
My comments are along the lines...Dear SEC: The US must lead in economic participation in Bitcoin or other economies will. Bitcoin has the potential to be a global economic force like none seen before. The risk of not embracing Bitcoin is much greater than the risk of an ETF.

He does not live the company mission: "At Coinbase, our mission is to create an open financial system for the world."
His employees do and they are telling him in his surveys that Lightning is where they can fulfill their mission. But he does not get it.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:11:30
They would only approve **because** Bitcoin is a threat.
The US does not want other economies to have power/influence over the US economy, so the US must lead in anything that could influence Bitcoins economic impact.
"Bitcoin is too big to ignore"

 \&gt;Ultimately Cobra owns the domain 
[bitcoin.org]( has "co-owners", not controlled solely by Cobra. At least that is what was said a few months ago when there was a push to get cobra removed and that is what the site says now.
What would the site be if Cobra had total control? Just look at his tweets the past year...seems likely we would have bitcoin .com version 2.
But agreed, it does not matter to bitcoin.
