-Accepted everywhere
Only everywhere in the US/country of origin.
-Transactions are instant
Try sending $1000 to a HongKong bank and count the 4-7 days
and count the fees.
A couple of minutes, close to zero fees.
-Easy to use
Bitcoin even easier in many cases.
Try Bitcoinspinner on you Android phone.
Just point at a QR code and click send.
Anyone can do it.
Try sending Bitcoins via email by getting an account on blockchain.info or simply use coinapult.
Send Bitcoins in email, twitter, facebook.
Try doing that with old fashioned Fiat.
Which money do you think the future belongs to?
-Fraud protection
Sure a little more.
-Reversible transactions
Thats a huge negative for lots of merchants since its the most
common type of fraud against them.
A transaction with creditcard can be withdrawn up to a year after
it was done.
Now imagine you have a shop and sell someone a car.
One year later that money suddenly is withdrawn from you. This is a pain for lots of merchants and one of the advantages for them with Bitcoin.
Creditcards VS Bitcoin.
Creditcards have a 100.000% higher fee per
transaction. Bitcoin wins on knockout! 
Fiat - Can be forged.
About 50% of all usd in russia is forged. Probably even more now!
 
Bitcoin 100% real!
Value storage:
Bitcoin, only currency with mathematically known supply in advance.
Bitcoin can go up hundreds of times in value.
Fiat will only go down, allways forever.
Do you wanna have all your money go down in value forever?
FIAT low risc
Bitcoin Highrisc
You chose.
I would chose some in booth (would be stupid not to) and I think thats what most people will. There are billions of people but only 21 million Bitcoins.
Which means the sky is acctually the only limit for Bitcoin in the long run.
