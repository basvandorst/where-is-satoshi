People running nodes? Are they allowed to offer themselves for free?

How much are lightning network fees?
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:12:45
Interesting, thanks. Who exactly gets the fee for lightning transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:41:01
Thanks. Now I'm curious to hear you play devil's advocate against yourself, if only for debate purposes. I'm just trying to understand all the angles and perspectives here.
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:40:54
No, I cannot.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:27:15
Yeah I'm aware. Mostly I'm trying to understand how to engage in dialogue with people who think BTC is controlled by Blockstream.
@_date: 2019-04-26 17:40:36
I'm just humbly trying to learn more, partially so that I can effectively argue with BTC detractors. Not sure what stories you have in your mind about my motivations. BTC is my largest holding.
@_date: 2019-04-26 18:45:08
Sorry if I chose the wrong sub, I'm just trying to learn. I'm trying to learn some of the main talking points to engage people who believe this conspiracy. Not to propagate it.

This question is not about whether LN is good, but about whether it can scale enough for worldwide adoption.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:35:37
What block size are you hypothesizing we might increase to throughout that time period, and how many years might that reduce the 38 by? If, as you said, global adoption might take 15 to 20 years, will lightning Network be able to remain relevant if they can't get users on fast enough?
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:37:45
Fair enough. I had been starting to think it meant there would literally be as much scaling as we'd possibly need.
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:33:20
Google knew they could slowly build data centers. Is there a rough consensus about how lightning Network might reduce this long figure I quoted for the number of years required for mass adoption? If plans are a dime a dozen, please tell me: what plan/plans are LN enthusiasts thinking of for addressing this particular scaling concern? Or, just tell me your personal opinion. I'm surprised, I thought that there would be some sort of consensus from LN proponents about this concern. (I don't actually know how much of a concern it even is, at first I thought it was just Bcash trash talk but now I'm starting to see his point...or rather, failing to come up with a good response to him on Twitter).
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:47:37
Oh. That's a decent solution I guess. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:53:44
Would the LN ever theoretically be able to open up enough channels for everyone on Earth? I was talking with a Bcasher who told me that, since max average on-chain transactions per day ~= 500,000, we'll never be able to sign up all the people on Earth. (Eventually, but at this rate it would take 38 years) Is this true?
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:32:46
Thanks, these are the kind of answers I was looking for. It has somewhat restored my faith in the future of BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:37:58
In that scenario, where people might "use a third party service to do the lightning transactions for them", wouldn't that still necessitate the person sending bitcoin to that third party??? How would that circumvent the issue?
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:43:24
I am not trying to bash or compare to other coins here. I am simply trying to understand if LN can scale to worldwide adoption. And, if it can't in the current state, what are some of the major changes that proponents of LN expect/believe will be able to make it possible in the future as bitcoin evolves? Or is that simply an unknown at this point? I have been very excited about LN until I heard about this particular scaling issue... I'm under the impression that it has a solution I'm simply unaware of, seems like it would be a common FAQ thing...?
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:44:43
In this discussion, I don't care about decentralization. I am simply asking, even with decentralization aside, if it's possible to scale enough with LN.
@_date: 2019-01-07 18:39:47
In that case I am curious to hear, what might evolve in the future to allow LN the ability to scale to worldwide adoption. Come on people please shill me harder on LN. I want to believe.
@_date: 2019-01-08 04:06:27
Thanks for the response. That was very helpful. I'm wondering, for the remaining 10 to 20 x improvement in that you said we'll need, are there  hopes/fears about whether that remaining efficiency can be obtained in a way that's still trustless and decentralized?
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:06:31
Thanks for the reply. I don't know, even if the blockchain got to be several terabytes or whatever, I still imagine there'd be plenty of people hosting it if it were cheaper than using VISA or BTC on-chain fees. Please point out the flaw in that logic thanks. If I get no response I will simply Google. You're not compelled to answer.
@_date: 2019-05-22 03:19:51
that's a nice philosophy, I really truly like it, but isn't it true that as long as there are enough nodes being run, I do have freedom in my money? Who saying that everyone has to run a full node?
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:12:51
Thanks for the reply... Can you help me understand, what is the difference in BSV that makes it so that a small group is able to change a critical consensus rule on a whim? I missed that point.
Also, on your second point, can you help me understand what is the difference in BSV that makes it so the threat of block subsidy diminishing is a thing, whereas in BTC there is no threat of block subsidy diminishing? Thank you!
@_date: 2019-05-22 03:12:02
So, there is indeed a transaction fee on BSV, is that what you're saying? Please help me understand exactly, how larger block sizes compromise chain security. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:22:30
Thanks, I'm aware of the importance of decentralization. I'm not aware how many nodes BSV has, or whether it's considered to be sufficiently decentralized at the moment. Do you know?
@_date: 2019-05-22 03:08:02
I was under the impression that his argument states that the size of a transaction determines the price that is paid to miners? That if you want to for instance upload some data to the blockchain, that you have to pay more based on how much data it is?
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:49:48
About the fee's here's what somebody told me on the BSV subreddit. (Thanks for your thoughtful replies, I really appreciate it). : "What is spam? Miners decide the minimum fee per Transaction so they remain profitable. From that there is no spam. A big transaction is priced more as the price is relative to the size but can depend on anything a miner needs to take into account (like script complexity).
BSV will allow you to set a minimum fee for strangers to email you for example. Will you call it spam when people pay you for sending you emails? If you dislike the content you just ask for a higher fee and that's what miners would do. Thus there can be no spam attack on BSV as any spam attack is just giving free money to the miners.
As for the blockchain growing in size, this is addressed too. First by moore's law making storage extremely cheap. We now have terabytes for a few hundred dollars and datacenters can afford so much more. Secondly, by the fact that the BSV mining client is already being prepared to be split into specialized fields. Some "miners" will specialize in hashing, and will not store the blockchain, while others will specialize in storing the blockchain and making it retrievable (for micro fees probably).
The centralization aspect is misunderstood. No one is able to define what decentralized means. What matters is that Bitcoin is competitive and free to enter (with an initial hardware cost of course). This means that any bad behavior is economically punished. Any such free system will converge to a few dominant players dominating market shares. Think Apple and Samsung dominating smartphone market share. But you don't consider the existence of smartphones risky because you know it's a competitive business and that dozens of small players are waiting to take their place.
The same happens in bitcoin, any change to the protocol is opposed by miners that can see the long term value of the original protocol and fork (as happened with BCH and BSV now). Even having a lower hashrate is no big deal when you have principled miners that have a lot of hash and can mine at a loss like the BSV miners already proved to do, because they actually don't mine at a loss, just a short term loss but for a long term profit.
Once people accept the fact that the protocol is set in stone and any change will fail, we will not even have minority forks like we have now. And nation states and banks will enter mining as a business and the competition between them will make bitcoin even more stable. 
Also not what you asked but metanet is necessary for bitcoin to grow monetary stability and monetary use as its intrinsic value is the storage in an immutable layer. No money can emerge without a first intrinsic value that is non monetary. Gold as jewels gave gold as money, which backed fiat currency to give it value which was then unbacked. But it always starts with a non monetary use that gives a monetary use later. Because the non monetary use allows for better price stability and gives an initial motivation to a lot of people to hold some. This is necessary (Mises' regression theorem of money) and is what metanet is here to do. 
Hope this helps"

Sure, first-mover advantage is a big deal. but, I'm trying to understand in the future, whether or not the technology and security of Bitcoin is somehow superior to BSV, or if it is simply the first mover advantage.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:31:22
I'm just asking for clarity on his points. I'm trying to get the knowledge.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:37:35
Thanks. What about BSV makes it possible for CSW and Calvin Ayre to change whatever rules they want? How exactly is that possible? Was there some change in the consensus mechanism that allowed that?
On your second point, that makes sense about the transaction fees. For the sake of education, could you play devil's advocate, do you know what the BSV folks would say about the transaction fee problem? Thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:45:19
I was under the impression that on BSV, the price per transaction depends on the size of the transaction. Here's what somebody from the BSV sub told me: 
(thank you for your thoughtful replies. It seems like the only way to have a reasonable discussion is for me to simultaneously have discussions on both subreddits and then pick the most mature people and copy and paste the responses to each other).

I agree with you on that point, about mining at a loss. however, if it's true that transaction fee depends on the transaction size, that sounds like there are indeed transaction fees to pay the miners...
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:30:42
That's an interesting point, but it still doesn't convince me that hosting a node will be so out-of-reach for enough businesses to make it sufficiently decentralized. Even if, for example, there are only as many nodes as supermarkets in the USA, that would still be pretty damn decentralised. And a pretty easy investment from the supermarket's point of view to process payments compared to all the credit card fees?
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:44:59
Just the fact that big blocks means more transactions for cheaper, and faster. (I'm not saying this argument alone is true, or, even if it were true, that it would mean that bsv is somehow better than BTC, but this is the type of argument I'm referring to that I would like to see debunked or explained why BTC is still superior in light of this difference). Thanks.
