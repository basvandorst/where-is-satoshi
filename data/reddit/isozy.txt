Yea marketing and advertising doesn't seem to be your field of expertise.
Take the example of popular brands staging that their twitter account got hacked, sending random tweets and then finally apologizing after getting viral.

Definitely worth a watch if you want to become a pioneer in this business.
I had to watch 6 times to find the secret behind the clear waters in this movie, I'm now ready to become a cryptonaire.

Actually I think the Wall Street guys have a thing or two to learn with us.

Don't know what to tell you low ambition people, that's as bad as being broke.

I dont remember the last time I had to use my bank account to pay any bill,  cash does the job.

Guys this is obviously a marketing stunt by Cryptsy and it's working, please don't give them anymore attention... Just look around...

Finally, now you can open yourself to new technology, try the Galaxy series. (It may be hard to adapt because you have been stuck to older technology for a while)

Looks like a marketing stunt to me.

Use bter.com as alternative to cryptsy, that's what I did.

You're dumb.
The 934 weren't stolen from a wallet, the 'hacker' replaced everyone's address for payouts to his address, so the auto payout was paying to him.

Of course why comment if you don't read the whole thing?!
Also it makes bitcoin look bad for newbies as they will think they can get easy hacked and also he is assuming that the pool owner is 'careless' when the guy just paid the miners from his own pocket!

And which customers lost any money? All I see is 2 guys claiming to be getting free btc. Can you drop the 'retarded'? Its annoying and childish.

In brazil you havd to go thru a metal detector and armed guards just to get in the bank,  I felt like I was in a war zone.

The user above is speculating. LTC is not an alternative to BTC anymore and as soon as there is something exchanging FIAT &gt; LTC the charts will differ from BTC and gain a fuel of its own. It will be worth a lot more in 7 months.
