If this should work "for the masses" this must be work differently.

my board arrived just in time for the weekend.
Installed the IDE on MacOS and installed ```mkdir -p ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/espressif &amp;&amp; 
cd ~/Documents/Arduino/hardware/espressif &amp;&amp; 
git clone  esp32 &amp;&amp;
 cd esp32 &amp;&amp; git submodule update --init --recursive &amp;&amp; 
cd tools &amp;&amp; python get.py```. 
Now I get this error:
/Users/xavierfiechter/Documents/Arduino/btc-ticker/btc-ticker.ino:3:30:

So, everything is too expensive? Can't consume enough?!

A hand full of Opendimes from Coinkite. These are awesome little UTXO storage devices.
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:43:17
It's about a web based wallet to build PSBT and allows you to track the price you payed per UTXO.

Hope that you're right.

This is really, really bad for beginners.   
I remember back in 2017 - I was on [bitcoin.org]( [bitcoin.com]( .. depending on the search result Google presented me.   
Lucky me I did my homework....   
Is it possible to report the scam directly to Google?

I'm OK with higher later... much higher – but later.
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:11:14
Noooo. I'm not done accumulating. Keep the &lt; 4K price for 3 or 4 more years...

If scenario 1 happens there is not real way to cash out BTC to any fiat, right? BCC would be possible.

We should send them a glitter bomb...

Good question!
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:15:29
great idea!
go and build it.

Thinking around the same topics for a few weeks now as well.  
I'm interested in: 
* green energy (solar, water) and consume the energy where it's produced (desert for sun, mountains for water, ..)
* re-using/harvest the generated heat from the miners
* how to make this "distributed" 
* mining

You could write a high quality post on your blog and inform your audience about it. Do not forget to link to bitcoin.org to keep the  on  in the SERP.

So because of the new set of addresses even by undoing the replay protection, all coins on the Nano S are safe, right?
@_date: 2019-02-08 23:17:06
Can't scan the code...
@_date: 2019-02-02 21:27:21
Are other cases like this where a lot of coins got lost forever?
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:37:11


I do not see a problem with that. Have 2 Nano S, 1 Trezor and soon a Trezor Model T!
Do not put all your eggs in one basket. :-D

Great!! I asked my Yoga Teacher (as well a girl) month back if I could pay with bitcoin. The answer was no – bitcoin is a boy's toy. ��‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:32:06
Will just using the split tool from Trezor or Ledger Wallet do the trick? 
Or should one create a new BIP 44 wallet-account below the same master seed and move the coins? 
Has every BIP 44 wallet-account it's own keys?

I'm pro Bitcoin and long term bullish, but from my point of view this has more to do with "mass collecting exchange fees" from you, than with "mass adoption".

We need the person who predicted the 30k, and a bit more exact what "this year" means to be able to track the prediction on the

Is this still an issue? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:48:33


97-3 is the stand of today. To ignore people just because they are the minority is ignorant and does not help a mass adoption at all!

Would love the get more insights....

You could re-buy after spending. Just let it flow :-)

It took me a while to get this network thing fixed. Could you give it a try?

Hi u/sumBTC
Thanks for your patience and opening the channel!    
I'm still in the learning process...   
I just figured out a few days ago how to decrypt a lightning invoice using [ 
or \`lncli decodepayreq &lt;invoice&gt;\`.     
There is the new invoice:

AWESOME! Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:12:52
Thanks for your replay.  
So what's the best practice? 
  
I have 3 devices:
* The node itself (localhost),
* a laptop in the same LAN and 
* a mobile phone with static assigned IP address
All of them should be able to connect to the node.   
Thanks for your hints. :-)
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:43:35


Could you paste your invoice for 200 sat?
