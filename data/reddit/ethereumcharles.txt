PoS does work and we have security proofs for it to be released in Mid-August. The debate is over.

Java is a great langauge and quite fast. It isn't 1998 anymore. Java 8 is an enterprise langauge, reliable, extremely easy to develop in and fast.

I'm sorry to hear this happened, but it's the nature of people. Unfortunately, some don't want to invest real time in understanding how things work and why they are valuable. Rather they want to be spoon fed a good story by a conman in order to believe they have the future figured out. Take solace in the fact that you'll still be around after the dust settles and your friends will have to accept the truth eventually. 
In the meantime, enjoy the ride, make some money and welcome to the revolution.

My understanding is yes. I don't speak for rootstock, but I believe the code is based originally on the ethereum java client and that the license will be preserved. Theyou have made considerable changes and improvements. There is also the pegging logic to move value between bitcoin and the rsk network. In general, these systems do not work well unless they are open source and the code is available for peer review. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 15:51:29
Yes the code has been written over a long period. It's in Java and it works. I saw it in person while down in Argentina.

Where is this only a whitepaper non-sense coming from? Have you downloaded Daedalus? Have you seen our Repo? Literally billions of dollars worth of Ada move around on our mainnet every week. We have already even done a softfork.

Yeah those three years I've been working on Cardano have been really inconsequential. And that company I've been CEO of since 2015. Huh it only has 100 employees and operates in 10 countries.

It's funny Bruce, they say the same thing about the Iraq war. Different administration, it's in the past. Let it go. I'm sorry man. The Foundation will not achieve any degree of legitimacy without an audit.

Because they have for better or worse attempted to claim the mantle of representing the Bitcoin community as a whole. Again this was done without any attempt to gain consensus and with a strong arm. So either they explicitly reject this former mandate and drop the global representation brand or start including the community in the debate

I find it incredibly ironic that on one hand Ethereum gets hammered as a massive security risk to all who dare touch it, but then suddenly, on the other hand, the Bitcoin core developers say all the innovation can be quickly forked into the protocol[?]( The whole point of altcoins is to provide a safe testbed for innovation while protecting the Bitcoin ecosystem from unforeseen issues.
Trying to turn the bitcoin protocol into a one size fits all currency is like trying to make a one world currency. There are too many disagreements, legitimate technology concerns, legal and regulatory issues as well as cultural barriers to expect it to happen quickly if at all. There is also the requirement of convincing the network participates to adopt the changes, which they simply won't do if it has the potential to collapse the currency's value. 
Bitcoin should be the ecosystem's safe, conservative store of value- keep it secure, simple and easy to acquire. Stop chasing the sexy new trends or engineering ridiculous, underpowered overlay protocols. Guys sometimes a truck is a truck.

SHA256 doesn't care about Shor's algorithm or any other Quantum computer algo. The answer is don't worry about it.

This article isn't representative of NSA culture anymore than the Harvard crimson is representative of Harvard culture. NSA is the largest collection of cryptographers In the world studying every kind of scheme imaginable. 
In all academic fields there are disagreements, rivalries, and differences of opinion, yet this shouldn't be construed as the modus operandi of the NSA rather just a cultural artifact.

I actually posted this on reddit a few days back and no one picked it up. Here's to a pithy title. The paper is currently in the peer review phase and subject to a lot of changes based upon feedback.

Wait so am I in charge or ETC or not It's hard to keep all the attacks straight. The caspers guys say I'm a scam artist with no technical skills and I guess here I'm a disgruntled ex-employee of the EF (I guess CEOs are employees too) out to make a quick buck.
Could you guys sync on your lines of attack and ad hominems? I'm getting confused. I guess it's because I confuse easy being so stupid and all.

Anything Ethereum can do, Rootstock can do and more securely and efficiently. It's an incredibly exciting project and has an excellent team.

Because they are not ubiquitous and are fundamentally unnecessary for bitcoin the currency. Bitcoin the internet of money needs completely different tech to be competitive.

Bitcoin deserves everything it's got coming to it. The community is pretty sad at times. The worst are the CP people. They should have suffocated by now after having their heads up their own asses for so long.
@_date: 2015-10-20 21:28:41
Because bitcoin represents a particular distribution and economic philosophy. It is naive to believe when we don't have consensus on things like politics, religion, programming languages, networks, operating systems and even if we went to the moon in some circles that somehow the whole world is going to say yep Bitcoin is the way. 
More likely than not, we'll see a large ecosystem of altcoins with different security mechanisms, levels of anonymity, economic philosophy, distribution and the focus ought to be the efficient, secure movement of value between the chains as well as making sure they can talk to each other. 
@_date: 2016-05-02 20:32:39
No it is not. You are completely wrong. It is a modified fork of the Ethereum Java client.

I was surprised to see a TED presentation for protonmail but nothing yet on bitcoin. I did a TEDx in Bermuda not too long ago; however, I don't think there is a proper TED on bitcoin yet. Truly astounding considering the social impact of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 20:58:55
I never argued for token free tech. I just think there will be an Internet of money instead of one universal standard. I'm much more concerned about the secure flow of value and communication.
