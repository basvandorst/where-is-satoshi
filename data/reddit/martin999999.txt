I started thinking seriously about bitcoin in accounting when I saw this presentation  in which itBit CEO Chad Cascarilla (CFA) mentions briefly some of the possibilities... Unfortunately he doesn't go into the details of how it could work... Links, comments and opinions are very much appreciated. Thanks

the existing wealthy elite have a net worth upwards of 500 million each. To match that wealth your 50 bitcoin would need to be worth 10 million each! That's just not realistic at all

True, I believe bitcoin's escrow hedging and derivatives potential will put it ahead of traditional reserve currencies from a 'plumbing' standpoint

Thanks. You're a star!
Here's a few more i found:
[Sveriges Riksbank](
The UK Government Digital Service link is to a blog post. It's a bit ambiguous and it doesn't mention bitcoin or the blockchain directly. I came across it in this coindesk article 
Thanks again

Nice. I'm interested to know, as you are heavily invested in bitcoin, are you concerned about the price? will you cut your losses if it falls further? As you may or may not know, the IMF and China have stated their intentions to include the Renminbi in the SDR basket this year. For the Renminbi to stabilise the SDR it's peg has to go. So i'm hopeful for the Renminbi

americanpegasus reminds me of myself except my investment philosophy is to buy 45% gold 45% yuan 10% bitcoin. Sell after the yuan is floated and Chinese gold holdings updated this year &amp; buy 45% commodities futures 45% commodities stocks and keep 10% Bitcoin. When all your friends are buying commodities and everyone's going nuts about commodities 10-15 years from now, sell them and go to the next asset... Whatever that may be 10-15 years from now!

By positive I mean neutral, positive or progressive, but not negative. I've read most of the negative analyses on bitcoin and I find them repetitive and a bit narrow minded. They use the past as a model for the future when thinking about new products and possibilities. Furthermore Bitcoin has been scrutinised for six years now and I think we've heard all about it's negative aspects and flaws already.

Yes, but If you'd really like to share some negative ones I won't be offended. Cheers
