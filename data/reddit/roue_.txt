"History will show that one of the authors was an idiot". What does that actually mean? What he wrote is reasonable. The high demand for Bitcoin is primarily from speculators who hope the value will rise in the future. t is quasi currency but mostly a digital commodity.

A finite supply is not necessarily good. It restricts economic growth, unemployment increases (due to people HODLing because they know their value will inccrease) and when there is a recession there is literally very few things that could be done to stimulate growth. Bitcoin is also not immune from manipulation. It is meant to be decentralized but depends heavily on sites such as coinbase and bitpay. 
A world where Bitcoin is the new standard is this a pipe dream and nothing but delusion on a grand scale.

Again does the OP specify his grandmum has a "Relatively good income stream?" No. So your statement is again as presumptuous as mine. The fact remains that you would not recommend it to your family but you think it is a good idea for someone else's family to gamble their money away.
And there is no such thing as "Money to spare." There is always a superior use for that money she wasting on bitcoin. She could be putting money in a college fund for her grand-kids or saving up to treat her family to a holiday in Disney. Again she can do whatever she wants with her money. But most sensible people would agree that there are far better uses than purchasing bitcoin.

Apple also has climbed so hard because they sold a record amount of iPhone and released Apple Pay (Set to revolutionise digital payments). 3D printing has fallen so hard in companies such as Stratasys because of the entrance of new firms such as HP and GE. Not because of people "losing their faith." I normally do not wish evil on people but please go all in on Bitcoin.

There simply would not be enough money for that to happen. Students loans, mortgages e.t.c The demand for credit is astronomical. Without fractional reserves this would 100% not be possible. Either that or interest rates would be significantly high because the demand would outstrip supply.

Sigh, our economic system will not exist without access to easy credit.

Lol. This comparison to the internet is something that bitcoin neckbeards continuously do. Bitcoin wishes it offers a fraction of the benefits offered by the internet. You still catastrophically fail to answer the simple question. What benefits does the usage of bitcoin offer to the average consumer? Transferwise makes one of the main selling points of Bitcoin; "Cheap way to transact money globally" redundant. 
My point is most of bitcoins selling points are already being or are going to be offered by technology in the future. So how can you realistically expect bitcoin to replace fiat it its already low intrinsic value is being eroded by the very technology it was built on (Internet).

Its fine for you to dismiss figures for subjective claims using useless metrics. 
And as for "bail-ins" the Yahoo Japan article you linked talks about investors in a bank not savers with a bank. Clearly a difference. And in the EU you get a £85,000 allowance that is protected.

Firstly saying bitcoin is  a currency is ignorant. It is Quasi currency but acts more like a digital commodity. Its current value is primarily due to speculative investors who believe 1 Bitcoin  will be worth $1,000,000 in a few years. When this grandeur illusion is gone the value of bitcoin will fall to nothing. No one buys USD or British Sterling in the hope that it will be worth more. Why? Because that is not how money works.
@_date: 2014-08-24 02:31:14
Exactly. Doesn't Bitcoin understand this system is needed in order to stimulate the economy. Access to credit is crucial to our economy. From new start-up businesses, someone looking for a car loan or a couple looking for a mortgage, credit is absolutely crucial to the economy. Which would grind to a halt and millions of people made unemployed if this system did not exist. This is why bitcoin will never be mainstream or replace fiat currencies. It simply does not fill this crucial requirement.

Downvotes, jokes and zero coherent replies. People here compare Bitcoin to the internet. But when Bitcoin fails miserably to offer any benefit to western consumers you know it is not going to make fiat obsolete. 
And the government gives two shit about bitcoin. If it was such a threat they would have shut down coinbase, bitpay and blockchain.info. Gasp! a decentralised currency that depends heavily on three websites.

 "Freedom to choose between a finite currency supply owned by everyone or a currency that can be manipulated at will by the financial elite.
Disruption is absolutely the right word."
The second reply suggesting the bitcoin is the superior alternative. My reply suggesting that the first comment is more than likely more accurate of what will happen in the future. Also new money is not "Being printed all the time." The Fed has ended QE3.

A credit card used by a financially educated person is the ultimate weapon.
1. 1% to 3% Cashback on your spending. Effectively giving you free cash if you pay your balance off in full each month. Lets say you spend $1000 dollars a month. 3% of that = $30. 30* 12 = $360 of free money that can finance an indulgence.
2. You basically get an interest free loan for a full month. So they lose money when you pay off in full.
3. Some cards have very good rewards. And normal spending on groceries, bills and rent can earn you a free holiday.

This simple mentality means you do not understand long term equity investment. Even though the SM is at an all time high individuals are investing for the long run. So investing now  rather than some arbitrary date when they think the stock market would be lower is a superior tactic. When the market finally corrects they can always just dollar cost average all the way down and up again.

I would agree with you on deficits. They are not sustainable and eventually when the interest payments on debt gets too large the country would either default on its payments or hike up taxes. Japan picked the latter ( And I do not think the middle class is  going to suddenly stop spending. People will always spend. The saying "Money has no value unless it is spent" rings true for a lot of people. 
Debt to GDP is currently at 101% 
So unless the US public vote in a government that drastically cuts public spending for the next decade. The ratio could reach the levels seen by Japan. But this is really 2 or 3 decades away.

Yes but they do not hold on to dollars for a few years. I have literally read tons of posters talk about how they will leave their bitcoin in cold storage and hope it appreciates in a few years time. Totally different from FX trading. Bitcoin in my opinion has the characteristics of a very volatile stock. Some people day trade and hope to gain profit and some are long term investors hoping that their current investment will be worth more and a time in the future. Its supposed job of actually being a currency is obsolete because merchants see it as to much of a risk to take on. So tell me if Bitcoin is supposed to revolutionise the world, make fiat currencies, governments and central banks obsolete, and cause power to return back to the people why does it fail miserably at doing the only job it is meant to do? The only thing keeping Bitcoin afloat is the armchair investor looking for somewhere to put his money in because he read a doomday article for 10min that told him the stock market is going to crash and the US dollar will become worthless. When that is the only reason this new money is surviving then you have a problem. 
From what I have read the only benefit it offers if that it does not devalue? Due to the fact that there is no central bank controlling its supply.

You do realise that there is cost push and demand pull inflation. The former can be caused by other factors, so your point that "Inflation steals from the people and rewards the inflaters" is moot. 
And of course people will still demand food and water. We call those life necessities. But what about luxury goods? New phone or a bathroom upgrade. With a deflation rate of let's say 7%. People WILL postpone their purchase of such items. Our economy relies heavily on consumer consumption. And a deflationary currency like Bitcoin just would not work. 
What I'd even more worse would be that Bitcoin is more fixed than gold . So deflation would very much be in the double digits. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:48:59
Did you read the last linked article? The "significant liquidity injection" is according to Slate "is sequestered from the actual economy and may as well not exist for most purposes." The most likely "Black Swan" event to happen in the next 2 years is a stock market crash when interest rates start to rise. Apart from that, your wet dream scenario of hyperinflation is definitely not going to happen in the next 2 years.

Again that comment literally has zero meaning to my argument that a world Bitcoin is the new standard will fail. Bitcoin is described as a deflationary currency and often touted as such.

"Aren't all currencies in competition?" No they are not. The USD and the GBP can both increase in value. The GBP derives it value from a mixture of economic factors. While you suggest the collapse of the world currencies will drive people to bitcoin. Again a currency that depends on the failure on another for it to gain traction is a failure.
And where in my post do I suggest demand will stop? But will demand be what you envision it to be? No. The world is not going to switch to bitcoin. 
A point raised by another user. 
Bitcoin is valuable because it is artificially scarce.
If, at some point, the world does switch over to a cryptocurrency, why the fuck would they use bitcoin? You don't think a single bank let alone the entire financial system could create their own cryptocurrency, one without a bunch of nitwits like Roger Ver controlling more than half the money supply?
I'm sure it's a fun little libertarian dream for them, though.
Again the world does not share your libertarian fantasies, bitcoin offers little incentive for the average guy to use it, and the cult like personality of its community is just repulsive. Keep on suffering from your delusion of grandiosity, hubris and exuberance. Put all your savings in Bitcoins. Worship your digital currency because you think it is the future. 
But when  the future comes. This sub will still think their little insignificant currency will be the future.

Zenith bank in Lagos already offers internet banking. More and more banks will do so.

"Spend within your means" tell that to people who otherwise would not be able to afford to go to university or buy a house that is in the six figures (a lot of houses).
And a deflationary currency will affect the average man more. What happens when he loses his Job because demand drops. Your first point is misguided. Even people in this sub have said they do not want to spend their bitcoins now because they think it will be worth more in the future. Imagine that HODL mentality on a global scale. Demand collapses and economy grinds to a halt. 
Again no modern country still uses the Gold standard or a commodity backed currency. Why? Because they just do not work. And you are simply not smart enough to argue otherwise.
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:58:58
A currency that depends on the failure on another for it to gain traction is a failure. "Currencies and economies are collapsing all over the world." Lol What countries? Russia?...
"What drove it from pennies to where we're at today?" an increase in demand ... Just like any other item. 
"Bitcoin will eventually be ready to receive them with open arms. It doesn't have to start or end with the dollar." Bitcoin will remain a instrument used by a small minority of the world population. It will never replace fiat and it will never make governments redundants. 
Your idolisation of a currency that can be easily replicated and that has little to no intrinsic value is very interesting.

You just created an arbitrary number to fit your narrative. Inflation is currently at 1.70% which is definitely not 10%
Could it be 10% in the future? Absolutely. But claiming this figure to fit your narrative is just stupid.And how is bitcoin a store of value when it has lost more than 50% of its value in 2014?

Except the opposite is true. In deflation the debt burden increases.
