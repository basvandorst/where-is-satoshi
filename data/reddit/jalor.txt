Maybe the problem here is the fact that this information is restricted at all.

Obvious scam is obvious.

Just pretend you were talking about Fiat cars the whole time.

It survived by becoming centralized. I don't think that would be good for Bitcoin.

If you gave me Chinese yen, I'd ask what alternate reality you found them in. Yen are Japanese and I strongly suspect you're a troll.

Then the problem is him having an attitude about it. Being a dick is being a dick, no matter where or how you do it. If someone insults people while playing an online game, does it mean online gaming is bad? No, it means that guy's behavior is bad.

That's a strawman argument. A "gift" like that is an obvious insult, but a Bitcoin wallet from someone who's clearly into Bitcoin is probably a really good gift in his mind. Imagine if you had a family member who was into occult shit and gave you a talisman to ward off evil spirits as a gift. You might not have any use for it, but from someone who actually worries about evil spirits, that's a thoughtful and well-intentioned gift.

People are so goddamn entitled nowadays. It's a gift, stop complaining.
