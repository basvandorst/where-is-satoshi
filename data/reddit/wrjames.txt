Why do people use MtGox still? They've shown their incompetence more than enough times, and it's not like there's a shortage of competitive exchanges.

Upvote for a good idea.

Fucking tell me about it.

I've been watching BTC for about 3 months now. I actually remember when it rose to $30 and considered getting in then. When the price dropped to $100 today, I didn't let that chance slip by me again. I'm in for a least a few years, if not more, so any future drops will only encourage me to buy more.

This market is bad for the idea behind bitcoins. People won't accept BTC for their goods if their currency has a record of dropping value 50% in two days.

Real money.  Lol.

I do all my exchanges here.  It's much less susceptible to panic, it seems.  Or, that's what I've noticed recently anyways.

I didn't mean literally, but I very much appreciate the humor. I'm in a similar situation, where I'd love to invest a little more but am hamstrung.
I'm in it for the long haul, so I wont freak out, but I'd like to get more BTC before each one costs $500.

Your answer basically boils down to "There are smart people who work on Bitcoin, we should trust them."
I could use the same logic and say "there are smart people who work at the FED, I should trust them."
That's awful. I think that the OP raises valid concerns, and we should do more than just trust that Bitcoin will do well because there are lots of intelligent people behind it. Intelligent people came up with our current model of economics, and if they see BTC as a threat, they'll put their smarts against it.

Hello Reader!
See what the OP has posted? Take that thing and don't do it. Do not do that thing.
Do not invest more than you are prepared to lose. In fact, as soon as you buy Bitcoins you should consider the money spent. If you pretend that you'll never get your fiat back, then Bitcoins market fluctuation will never scare you.
OP's advice is horrible. Do not follow it.

Your username is probably sending people some really mixed messages.

Sorry to say this, but your post wont be received well. You are basically begging for coins, and in the current market you wont get much sympathy. If you're truly interested, try creating some content that you can sell for BTC. Write articles about the market volatility or how to build GPU mining machines or something.

Make your own decisions based on your personal position financially and mentally.

Nobody can accurately answer this for you, and if someone tries to to tell you they know more than anyone else, they're probably full of shit. 
Bitcoin will not disappear, but really there is no way to predict it's market value right now. It wont go as low as $.1, and it wont go as high as $1M right now. It might hover around $50, and it might drop to $30 or $15. 
You're asking a question that can't be honestly answered. If you believe that bitcoin will climb to $100+ again someday, then now is a good time to invest. If you don't believe that, then wait. It's you're call, and you're the only one who can make it.
