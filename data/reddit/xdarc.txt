This thread is hilarious.  60 comments in and you guys can't even decide which ones are the bad banks as some people post different experiences.
So far as I know, no banks in the US outright have a policy of blocking all crypto transactions.
That doesn't mean your credit card issuer won't block them.  CapOne credit cards recently did.  Not to be confused with a CapOne 360 bank debit card.  Those work fine.
That doesn't mean the debit card tied to your checking account won't get held up by fraud monitoring since coinbase uses a card processor in Great Britain.  You can easily call to verify the transaction; often times without even speaking to a person if the bank has a newer automated system.
That doesn't mean that you can conduct crypto transactions out of a business checking account.  Unless you are registered as a money services businesses banks will close your account for this.  
Otherwise banks in the US really don't care about it so far.

These are cap one credit cards; not cap one 360 bank debit cards.

It is a point of concern when inflation adjusted wages are stagnant across the board and for most households likely worse than 10 years ago.  I mean, why do you think a reality TV guy is in the white house- it's not because everyone's just having a wonderful time I'll tell you that much.  Anyway this board is turning into ZeroHedge- I like it.

It's absolutely their responsibility to know.  They are audited regularly and they can't just claim ignorance when it comes to money laundering regs and fines are huge.  Honestly if you have a business account and money services is not your business then you have no business running crypto transactions through that account.  You will be doing yourself a favor come tax time when the IRS wants to know exactly what the hell it is you think you're doing buying crypto with Joe Blow incorporated.  
Use your personal account and no one will care.  The IRS does not provide the guidance here, the OCC and FinCen provide the guidance and the FRB and SEC enforce.  Banks aren't stupid or being lazy here, and if you want to beat them at their own game you better wise up.
Also the people confusing card blocks with the account closure warning this guy got... The transactions have come through from the UK, standard fraud prevention software will toss a flag when foreign transactions show up, no surprise.  You call and say yes I approved them and that's the end of it.  You're not going to get a letter from some low level avp in loss prevention over it threatening to close your account; that privilege is reserved for people who use their business accounts irresponsibly and end up burning their own ass anyway.
Unless you really want that IRS audit.  It's funny, people always bitch about it being "muh money," but when the IRS gives those same people trouble they then get mad at the banks for letting them do whatever they did to catch unwanted attention.

It could be a DBA and it's still technically a business account.  The caption would be Jordan b Spencer DBA DJ Jordan.  looked over his Facebook out of curiosity and he made a post about shutting down his DJ business in 2013.  That's the exact way he phrased it, not a gig or side job, bet it was a biz acct and he just kept using it as his personal account, I see it all the time.  I read through the original post in the Facebook group where it was first shared and he doesn't say much about it one way or the other.  Made one follow up comment to say he called PNC and some other bank and whoever he talked to said they either have or are implementing a policy against it.  Which I doubt, probably got some level 1 CSR who started in the last few months and just wanted to get the dude off the phone.

This looks like the option that banks have to transfer from accounts you own there to accounts you own at other banks.  Key thing being accounts you own.  The company that used to do it was cashedge, but not sure if it's them or clearxchange/zelle.  Anyway if you choose to do between banks rather than to a person, and your money is going to a 3rd party, they will spank you eventually.  
Reason is between banks/external option is only for accounts you own, not only can you send money but you can pull money from that other account.  If the account don't belong to you, then they suspend you.  They don't always check these unless they are in top x percent of transactions for that day.  Maybe the guy was using the wrong option, doing a bigger transaction than usual, and finally made the top of the heap for a human to check names on accounts involved.  Once they catch it they have to suspend the service.  Usually they just explain and advise on the correct use of their service or suggest ways to pay 3rd parties.

I posted guidance from fincen earlier which says that person's engaging as a business in the purchase of crypto who send it to others can be considered money transmitters and would have to register as an MSB.  That's all the reason a bank needs, they can't control what you do with it and they don't know so they won't take your business.  If they get audited the auditor says you have accounts which should be registered as MSBs which are not because of crypto; "we didn't know" will not get them out of penalties which could include losing their bank charter.  It's literally an entire departments job at every financial institution to know.  You guys don't understand how seriously banks take this stuff.
And if this really was some bank crackdown, why one podunk credit union?  Small banks do not lead the way on interpretation of regs and establishing policy.  No.  If it were a crack down you would know pretty good damn fast.  It would start at the mega national banks like chase bofa Wells etc and they would allow update their policy around the same time and regional banks and smaller would then follow.

Just has to hold 13 and we're still looking good for 16700 on Sunday/Monday.  It looked to me like a pattern of slightly higher highs with slightly higher lows was forming over a span of about 3/4 days.  Still looks ok to me.  The whole korea ban scare from yesterday left the selling a bit overdone.

So Jealous.  I also bought a home around the July 2012 bottom for 75K and now I could easily sell it for 130-135... but my gf doesn't want to move in with my mom and does not want to do an apartment again.  Meanwhile it's been perfectly ok for her single mom sister to shack up with us for the past 6 months while she doesn't work and earns a little babysitting money here and there.  I had to install a solid core door just to watch tv with subtitles on after 11.  Sit on the sidelines and homes will drop back down in 2-3 years after this next fed bubble bursts... save enough for a nice down payment; 20-25K.  Pay off debts next.  Then gamble with the rest.  Good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:27:35
I wouldn't call that left shoulder a shoulder since it punched up to the 19s on Dec 7th and that isn't reflected on the chart there.  More like double top followed by the correction which we went through already followed by consolidation period of higher highs and higher lows... if this patter holds over the weekend we're in good shape.  If we lose 13K this will probably cause another wave selling which could see us dip into the 10s.  I'm just keeping a little cash in my account in addition to my holdings,  I'm ready to buy either way because there's still a lot of time for this to go bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:10:54
You guys need to understand this guy was probably using a business account to get this letter since biz accounts subject to rules for money services businesses where they have to register with fincen and if they banks ignore it and they get audited they will get hit with a fine.  Fincen guidance a bit hazy when it comes to businesses and crypto and what the IRS says about it just for you and your taxes; it's not guidance on anti money laundering regulation.
If you are using a personal account the worst thing that will probably happen to you is your card may get blocked because coinbase uses a card processor in London.  It's annoying but you just call number on back of card and say you authorized it and you're good to go.  In some cases it's automated entirely and you don't even talk to a person.  You certainly won't get a letter threatening to close your account.  
But yes the rules are different for business accounts.  This guy hasn't said if he had a business account but they call it a "business" transaction, extra word, probably means business account.

Oh yeah we're gonna, costs me a fortune in paper towels- lol.  I like your idea of buying 1 coin; ought to leave you with enough to pay down debts, save a down payment, and have a nice emergency cushion as well.  I try to have 6-12 months of bills saved up in case the jobs toilet flushes again like it did in 08.  Just be ready to have brass balls if you decide to buy a whole coin; crazy price swings lately.

Ok you guys still don't get it.  Open a business checking account at any bank.  Start buying crypto.  See what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:56:00
Some of us work for banks.  Rather than watch you guys spew ignorance and fud we'd like to try and explain what is actually going.  Every time someone's card gets blocked for foreign transactions or they get a phone rep on a power Trip there are bank crackdown articles on the web.  There is no crack down and when there is one you will know.

Letter says "business transaction," is this a business account?  If so banks won't take the risk because of regs in regards to transaction that could be MSB/money services business.  It's part of AML/anti money laundering regs and compliance violations are steep.  
Bitcoin is a grey area for banks  
They're going off of the guidance above and if you read it businesses can be considered exchangers or money transmitters if they send crypto to others but not if they're using it to purchase goods. There's no way for the bank to know what you're doing so they'd just rather not take the chance since the guidance mentions persons engaged as a business and they this reg definitely applies to business accounts.  Last guy I saw who posted a letter like this had a graphic design biz and decided to run crypto transactions through it and got the same treatment.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:20:53
No.  You don't understand.  Fincen.gov registers money services businesses.  The IRS saying Bitcoin is property is for you and your taxes, it has nothing to do with banks.  Anit money laundering regs do and fincen.gov writes the rules on that too.  When the guidance had a broad interpretation banks don't take the risk.  Trade crypto in business account that is not registered as an MSB at ANY bank and it's very very likely they will close your account.  Personal account?  They won't give a shit because fincen says personal accounts can only be classified as users and not an msb. 
Further where a company is registered has nothing to do with where that company's card processor is based out of.  Coinbase uses at least one in the UK.

Yeah I'd buy at 13,500 there's definitely going to be a bounce there if it touches.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:51:00
It failed to hold 13,500 the other day and broke to 12,500.  The bounce to 14 is nice, but I am afraid it won't hold since yesterday broke the pattern of slightly higher highs followed by slightly higher lows. I sold yesterday when it broke support and I'm waiting to pick it up lower.  We probably won't see any really big moves until after the new year when volume picks back up.  Even if it just moves sideways for the next few days that's a healthy sign and will help to make any further coming dips less painful/deep.

Stopped reading when he said he had an account for his Web development business.  
They aren't going to give a shit if you use your personal account.  They aren't going after regular customers, but if you have a business account and you transact in anything that could be considered a money services businesses; even party stores cashing checks- you bet your ass they will shut you down if you arent registered as one.
It's not little bill's savings account that he opened with birthday money, it's a business account and amazes me the numbers of business owners who don't read.  No wonder 90 percent fail in the first year.

A loss has to be less than your basis cost.  Your basis cost is the 100$ you put in to buy the asset.  When you sold the asset/bought the games you got 250$  So you would have a gain of $150.
From what I've been reading most people don't bother reporting that income, and if the exchange doesn't have your ID or SSN there's no way they could report that income to the IRS.  I remember having to give all of that to open a brokerage account; I was surprised to see you don't have to give any of that to coinbase unless you want higher limits.  
I was reading that right now they don't report at all (they don't send out 1099s) but the IRS summons sent over to coinbase in July is asking them to hand over any info they have on users from 2013-2015; it specifies things like copies of IDs and SSN- but payment methods and any device info (IPs) are so far out of scope.  
This is why all coinbase has is a name/email/phone number and I don't want to give them anything else.  If coinbase ever ends up having to turn over payment method info; even that may be enough.

Work for a bank.  To enroll in some services, it's not uncommon to send your personal information through a soft credit check to verify your identity.  If you have no credit history, you're basically off the grid and these services can't enroll you without some manual intervention.  That's why they say "younger adults," nice way of saying you don't exist as far as almighty credit agencies are concerned.

You know whats crazy on gdax there's like 600 coins in the way of 9000; limit orders- from there to 10K there's another 1200 coins up for sale; but after 10K the limit orders are mostly flat- like 300 coins from 10k to 14k.  To me that's a good sign.  People will always change their orders or do a market order- but there's not a ton of selling pressure and buyers are finally having to compete with one another after a week of consolidation.

Money services also includes businesses that exchange or convert currency.  That's nothing new.  Those kinds of businesses have always been under extra scrutinty due to anti money laundering regs.  If banks are negligent or in violation of compliance they get slapped with huge fines. 
 What's new is banks are realizing bitcoin is exactly like traditional currency exchange and if you run these type of transactions through a business account they will close it out if that's not your business.  They gave this guy a bunch of stuff to fill out and since he's not a legit MSB I'm guessing his explanation of why he was doing these transactions didn't make them too warm and fuzzy.
Bottom line don't run this stuff through a biz account and you'll be fine.  If you have a personal account you are fine.  People getting blocked at chase is just standard fraud prevention- personal account holders will not get their accounts closed out like this guy did.

Whoops- I misread basis cost in example as 100 not 200- so yeah it would be 50$ gain.  Also I did not report my brokerage activities when I started trading the first year ten years ago; I figured I didn't owe any money so I didn't need to report.  Brokerages send out 1099s to the IRS so they will know about the trading.  Anyway, couple years later they sent a letter that I had trades totaling 100K with no cost basis so as far as they knew I owed on 100K in gross sales; just from 5K trading back and forth- and all they had me do is fill out the schedule D showing the trades and it was all good.  In fact after it was all over we found a mistake and they cut me a check for $77.  They can't penalize you if you didn't owe; if you do know you're going to owe them on those trades- yeah that's another story.
