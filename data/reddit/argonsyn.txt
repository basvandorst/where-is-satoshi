Not in the US then, anyone know what the regulations for this sort of thing are like in the UK? I know they operate here as well.

Was just about to link this, this should be more visible.

I mean, it's been quiet on the bitcoin news front for the last few days, and the value has been pretty stable...

While I have a lot of respect for Andreas, I was asking someone who knows Dorian what they think the best course of action would be. 
Not everyone would appreciate a huge chunk of money from strangers on the internet.

I feel like a bit of a vulture here, waiting for Mt Gox to crash so the price of BTC crashes and I can get some more cheap coins.

He doesn't strike me as the kind of guy who knows about altcoins.

Neither of you visited the website or read what the OP said huh?
This is a wedding venue, a place to hold a wedding. Like all locations you rent for a special occasion, you need to pay for the privilege. This place, can be hired with bitcoin.

If you had hacked his account, this is a pretty boring use for it, don't you think?
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:49:37
Stick them all on Mount Gox! 
I joke, that's a horrible idea. Seriously, don't do that. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:22:13
Statoshi is back in the news in a big way, not too weird that people are checking all known Statoshi accounts right now.

Remember how hacking is usually punished under the wiretapping laws that were originally penned with telegraphs in mind, and it doesn't seem too far fetched that they'd do this.

Maybe we should contact coinstar in the UK/Ireland/Canada then? Different finance regulation might make them more likely to do it.

Any chance you could let me know when the crowd funding starts, this sounds like something I'm like to be a part of!

I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying they can do it though.
If your bank doesn't let you buy BTC, then you're fucked. You can get no BTC, do nothing with BTC. They have stopped you from using it. They've guarded a road and stopped you getting on a plane.
Obviously they don't hold all the power though, you can switch banks or just work/sel stuff for BTC.

The point of entry for bitcoin just got much lower, potentially putting a bitcoin ATM on everystreet corner, although it's a longer process.
I personally can't wait to try this method of buying later today.
Edit: Seems to be a 3% fee, is it because you can go to the shop and pay with a credit card? That might explain it.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:53:55
Well it depends what country you live in. If you're in the US, I've heard coinbase is a good, easy way to sell although I've not tried it myself.

It's from when the bitcoin community was more like today's dogecoin community.
I still love it though. I partly want bitcoin to succeed just so this image appears in future economic and history textbooks.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:26:41
Ah, but you still need to take the road to be able to get on a plane.

Just scanned you and sent you some BTC, you were both my first QR code scanned and first amount sent to someone that wasn't me. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:52:02
Also in the UK, [Bittylicious]( Only supports bank accounts that feature faster payments though, and a trade limit of 0.2BTC per order right now.
Also, a ridiculous name.

Yes, quantum computers would enable better encryption, but first they have to be commercially available. 
Until then the NSA will have a huge advantage (assuming their quantum computers work as planned.) Until then, they have super code breaking and we don't have super codes.

I'd say sell some of them. Having $3,000 is nothing to be sneezed at, and you still have a few saved up in case the price does skyrocket.

I guess that the coin was minted in the US? I'm just guessing though.

Buying on localbitcoins is less safe though, ans near me at least, cash in hand trades have higher prices than bank transfers.

Is there any way that the community can help your brother, without intruding into his life anymore than has already happened?
I imagine he just wants all this to die down and go away, but people here still want to help.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:44:39
Yeah I think I've got two actor authentication on, that's like needing my phone to log in, right? 
And thanks for the advice about the cold storage, I'm looking more into it as I get more into bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:12:10
That is a fantastic idea, I wish you luck. 
All the other suggestions in this thread are machine to machine, but you might be able to come up with a way someone could easily remember their address and tell it to others, something important if this all takes off as an easy to use everyday viable currency.
It's gotta be pretty foolproof though, one misremembered word and that BTC is going to someone else.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:14:12
When talking about paying a tax on buying BTC in Germany did that woman suggest carrying around dollars as a backup currency? Really?

I was one of those new users that signed up this week, and let me explain why I did so.
I've been wanting to get into BTC for a while, and looked into it a couple months ago but was put off with having to download the software and having a wallet on my PC because it felt really complicated and I didn't want to lose my money if    my PC sUddenly died. I know it probably isn't that hard to use the software, and I could back my wallet up, but the fact is that it seemed really difficult and so I didn't.
But then I came across coinbase, an online based wallet and its really user friendly to a noob like me. No software donload, just my BTC right there in my browser wherever I am.
I can't comment on their coin selling abilities because I live in the UK and they only accept US bank accounts so I went to another site to actually get some coins in my wallet.
Anyway, I made this account just to let explain to you guys why it's so appealing to people who might have been put off by other methods of getting into bitcoin, since it's been all over the news since passing the $1000 mark.
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:15:22
I'm from the UK too and initially signed up to coinbase before I realized it was US only.
I've used both [bitbargain]( and [bittylicious]( to buy bit coins here, no id process and you can buy in minutes from startup if you use a bank transfer to pay, although you must make sure your bank account supports "faster payment". 
If you use bitbargain make sure you're buying from a seller with a high number of previous sales, then you'll be able to trust them.
It's nerve wracking to send the payment out into the blue the first time and hoping you get your coins that's why I recommend only buying £1 or so to start with and building up so you don't have a heart attack.
