You realize it costs money to maintain a bank account for millions of people, and when those accounts are empty the bank can't make money on them. Having a bank account isn't an inherent right.

There are minimum standards of cyber security, customer service, financial reporting and compliance that all cost subststancial amounts of money. Plus all of the services like bank transfers, credit cards etc

Idk why everyone in this thread is so salty, personally I think yes within a few years 10k will seem cheap. Bitcoin just needs to get further along in development/implementation/adoption before another massive fomo bull run will pump the price

Im very sceptical of these results... the survey only had a sample size of 2000 with what is most likely a self-selection bias. I'd be shocked if the real number was anywhere near 8%

As someone who sells on ebay, this would be huge if fees were low enough because buyers wouldn't be able to fraudulently refund their purchases at will
