What do you recommend for USD to BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-13 06:59:44
You're not wrong. It's just the point of Lambo is you have so much wealth that every issue you brought up is trivially insignificant.
For perspective pretend there's someone from a third world country criticizing every aspect of your life. You're already someone else's Lambo.

This reminds me of the time Katy Perry engaged a troll on twitter. Turns out the guy was just mad he couldn't afford his medical bills.

In the future kids will taking economics class will learn about the time the market rejected the chance to be on the ground floor of a revolutionary technology...
And instead watch an irrelevant old man eat his own dick.

You're just frustrated, it's ok to let of steam by going on a rant, we have all done it. If you don't like my comment don't respond or just downvote.

Yeah but it's best not to be too aggressive. At work I'm now referred to as "That guy who won't shut the fuck up about bitcoin"

Not too distant future: "I should have bought at $4,800!"
Psychology is weird. I was interested in bitcoin back when you could mine with a raspberry pi. Had too many doubts tbh. I never got off my lazy ass and actually did anything about it. I'm happy I bought a couple weeks ago and been enjoying the upward roller coaster. Now the optimists say $1000 is the new floor. :)

**PLEASE READ THE SIDEBAR BEFORE DECIDING**
I just bought bitcoin for the first time today and all I can give you is my reasoning:
1) I intend to hold it for the "long haul". It's very volatile but trends positively.
2) I won't spend more than I can comfortably lose (Think responsible gambling/ Entertainment budget)
3) Not to get political, but I try to stay informed: In light of recent political turmoil here in the US and abroad, buying bitcoin "feels" like the right time for me now.
Good luck!

iirc they use 2 factor authentication. Do you have a cell phone and bank account registered with coinbase? There are so many ways for them to verify your identity and get your account. Good luck.

How does 1 bitcoin stack up against a bushel of wheat?

Remind me why two completely unrelated things can be compared again?
@_date: 2017-02-27 02:58:21
How long has it been restricted?
 In my experience there's about a 1 to 2 day delay for Coinbase to verify the banking information.

On Moblie. There was a reddit post with sauce to SEC rules.

Yep.  
Yes (Approval) = Yes  
No (Denial) = More proposals down the pipeline to consider  
No Decision Reached by March 11 = Automatic approval

Sounds like a phishing scam/fake site. I set up an account last week and I didn't have to do any of that webcam/pic stuff.

Nope. If every person and business stopped accepting USD you'd still have to pay taxes in USD.

I am not a lawyer but I think having the wording "prevailing rate" is a pretty safe bet. Might hurt large corporations that pay millions in taxes if the gov fudges with the rate a little to get more money.

None of these comments are going to teach you anything. You won't learn anything until you see Bitcoin go back to ATH then quadruple in value.
