Buy it. Not a joke - you need to educate yourself so you don't appear like a **complete** retard. Linking this to you, or anyone who seriously believes in crap like this is a public fucking service.
And i'm afraid you'll have to buy it with fiat.

Don't worry. It's anally impossible for bitcoin to go below 6050.24321

If i want a HTPC, i'll buy a goddamn HTPC, not a half-ruined PoS. I don't purchase second-hand electronics for private usage, for the same reason that i don't buy second-hand underwear. 
I applaud the people that do this, but realize you can't just shove 5000 damn ASIC's on Ebay and expect to sell them all.
This is, quite literally, just garbage. Scrap it, melt it, recycle it.

I know another - you don't need to worry what to buy or do with your money anymore!  
....Because you will no longer have money ;).

Here's the problem with that argument - and no, i'm not "missing out" on anything i consider valuable.
If you believe your own investment thesis regarding investment X, you'd want the price to drop in order to purchase more of the same. The whole concept of wanting others to "HODL" is pretty damn indicative of the great big pyramid scheme that many avid and capable investors with decades of experience consider most cryptocurrency to be.
Sure you've noticed the S&amp;P has dropped quite a few points over the past 2 months - as a result, my own investment portfolio (which holds exactly zero magical internet money) is down a few percent a bit for the fiscal year. Do i care? Do i give a shit as to when the next "run" is going to be?
No. As far as i'm concerned, it hasn't dropped even CLOSE to far enough for my taste. I'd like another 30-40% drop before i'd consider investing in many of the awesome companies on my watch list. And the companies/investments in the red don't bother me for a second, because a) I'm exceedingly diversified and b) i consider my investment cases in all of them to be sound and volatility to be irrelevant.
The entire argumentation regarding this so-called "store of value" reeks of people wanting other people to buy their heavy bags so they can cash out at the expense of clueless imbeciles. If you're convinced by crypto, you shouldn't be whining about the next "run" - you should be hoping for another 50% drop.
A huge payday? I don't consider investing in magical internet money to be any kind of payday - huge, safe or otherwise. If you do it - awesome, but if you spend your days here trying to calm your nerves and convincing others to invest in this garbage, you might wanna take a step back, pull your head out of your crypto-encrusted ass and consider why there's that treacherous feeling in your gut that Bitcoin won't be having another great "run".

What utter garbage. Complete fake. Move on.
@_date: 2018-11-24 12:58:21
Believe me - we won't. It's almost as funny when it's a "run" as when it's crashing :).

I wouldn't buy a miner with PSU for 50 bucks. Too much of a hassle to make anything with it.
Hell, i wouldn't take a miner for free - i'm not in a habit of keeping garbage around my property.

Any product that feels the need for advertising is probably not worth buying in the first place. Good products sell themselves. One of the problems with things like cryptocurrencies are the ads that are reminiscent of a specific kind of advertising.
Advertising found on porn sites and the like.
If someone is trying to shell you some shit-product on the street, or the interwebs, chances are you're better off not buying it. Simple.

You're right. This is obviously a good move for bitcoin, and for cryptocurrency overall. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:12:03
So, a video with 93 views vs BBC, Times, NYPost and other major news outlets?
Seems legit, bud.

No magic interweb-space-money for me, my man. Thanks.
Maybe i'll buy it as a goof when it hits $0.50 or so. Blockchain tech is exciting though, but my investments are centralized around things people actually need. Food. Toilet paper. Tissues. Oil. Energy. 
In a few months, i'm guessing part of my dividend income will be coming from the tissues the bag-hodlers are gonna be buying :P.
In all honesty though, i wish you the best. And if you've lost money at today's price, i feel for you. If i were in that position, i'd be offing my bitcoin - or any cryptocurrency - as fast as my internet connection would allow :).

Bitcoin will fail when people realize the amount of actual FIAT invested in bitcoin is only a small portion of what people believe it is.

Are you like, actually on fucking acid? You think the indian government is going to give two flying squirrel tails about an online petition from magic internet-money-users?
Expect this to happen in more countries :).

The only revolution will be the one in your stomach when you hurl every meal you've ever eaten once your magic interweb coins reach the strong "real" value of $0.00000.
But hey, good luck. 17k on 1.3 billion. Going strong, right.
