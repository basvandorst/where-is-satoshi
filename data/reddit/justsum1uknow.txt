I rechecked blockchain, the total input was 27.99 where as I only had 27.95 on my account, could it be that I'm missing the 4 cents for the fees or is it automatically taken away from the 27.95?

It's confirming &lt;3

Welp imma just give up on it, I'll just assume the money's gone and uhh, yeh, thanks for helping.  
If I ever will touch BTC again I'll stay the fuck away from Copay.

Nope, just PC

Also, I have very little faith in support from well, any company.  
After waiting for 30 days to get back an account which I had all the proof for (bank statements, emails, etc), I highly doubt I'll get my answer

I'm using Copay.  
The first two transactions confirmed, the last one hasnt

I really don't get it, blockchain has confirmed two of the transactions but no action on my wallet?  
SS of Copay wallet history:

Well, what can I really do to fix the situation?  
Just pray that I'll somehow magically get my money back?

There's no way to change the actual fee, all I filled out was the BTC address, the amount and the note

It's been roughly 5h now, I'm really starting to lose hope.

To be honest, that's a dead end 100%, I'm pretty sure I chose the single fucking worst wallet ever, Copay, their support leads to github,
