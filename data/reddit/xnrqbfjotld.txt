Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

I heard if you say "bcash" 3 times while looking in the mirror, Jihan appears out of nowhere and tries to FUD you.

meanwhile, bankers continue to be protected by laws that allow them to generate money out of thin air, and give it to themselves while they continue to drive the world economy off a cliff.

Whatever he's got, he should sit on it for at least the next 5 years. I really believe that the next pump will rise to numbers in USD terms that seem big now, but in 2023-2025 or so, it will be much bigger. 
If Bitcoin becomes a reserve currency, shits gonna be off the chain.

There will soon be many people in Gaza who only know 12 or 24 English words, and those words will all be from this list:
of course, they could choose  
* [Japanese](
* [Korean](
* [Spanish](
* [Chinese (Simplified)](
* [Chinese (Traditional)](
* [French](
* [Italian](
too :-)

me too. 
even worse, I sold off almost all of mine to survive through a really rough patch. I was actually homeless for a while, trying to tough it out, but I have too much going on and it was too stressful, so I caved and started cashing it in to be able to have a roof over my head to be able to focus on healing some medical issues.
as much as Bitcoin will be worth in the future, it wouldn't be worth anything to me if I died

\&gt; You did well man, forget about getting rich and focus on getting better. 
Thank you. 
It's an interesting thing for me, that I had to go through a trying to get rich phase, then to get to the point where I have almost no BTC left, for me to get where I am now.
I now know that trying to get rich was not about me wanting to hoard money, and get lambos and shit, and it never was. 
It had everything to do with being able to feel secure in my ability to provide for myself, and also to contribute to the greatest good. I can do these things wihout a giant pile of money. Money makes it easier, and I wouldn't refuse it if a windfall comes my way, but there are other ways, and those ways also help me heal physically, so I am working on those. (Community being a great example)
Money is one way we control what we are contributing to (this makes it all the more important that society takes the parasitic banks out of the equation), but it is not the be all end all. It only feels like it is when things are manipulated so that we mistakenly believe that money is the only means we have available to us to take care of ourselves, and each other.
It's not. It's just a tool. A tool that had been turned into a weapon against us, that Satoshi took back.

It's cool, man. It's a conversation. 
My primary thought on reading your post is that I totally see where you are coming from, and agree that the 'on the run' thing would taint the earnings form it.
That said, though, I feel like it's important to emphasize that the root of that issue has nothing to do with weed itself, and everything to do with the oppressive laws around it.  
Also, getting to the point where you felt like a junkie with weed is neither a mark against weed itself,  or against your character, imo
Weed is a tool, kind of like electricity. Electricity can make life better, or can be used to intentionally end life, or can accidentally lead to injury and or death. The more powerful the tool, the greater the need to respect it's power.
Addiction is rooted in trauma, and we live in a society where trauma is basically the status quo for most of us. Western culture is a culture rife with addictive behaviors because of this. 
If you aren't familiar with it, there was a kind of famous experiment that fleshes out what I am talking about here. Google "Rat Disneyland" if you are interested.

I know you put "/s" but you are still implying that he does have a stash somewhere and that in turn implies that his request for donations is less than ethical 
Can you clarify?

You seem to be under the impression that as fear levels rise, rational thinking either stays the same or maybe even goes up. 
The reality of it is that there is a tipping point for fear levels where rational thinking kind of catastrophically fails. 
If you have ever been in a truly high stakes situation, you may recall that to some degree there is a level of "autopilot" that kicks in. Whether or not that autpilot is an idiot or Neo in full on Prophesied One mode is determined by a lot of factors.

Really? That is the ONLY explanation? 
Really? 
No other explanations possible? 
Nothing that maybe you didn't already think of?
Nothing?
