Human stupidity. I recommend the book, Debt: The first 5000 years (David Graeber).

You are allowed to participate but posting the same fallacies from 30 different accounts is quite pathetic.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary payment system. 
While it has risks, it cannot be mentioned on the same page with the things you wrote.
There's a sub for the likes of you: @_date: 2014-07-05 14:15:12
He ignored all the warnings and spent his life savings on a joke currency.
I cannot feel any sympathy for people like him.
One could say that I'm a bitcoin true believer but I wouldn't put more than 35% of my wealth in bitcoin at this stage, and I would avoid any altcoins as they are only useless clones.

That's the key part. Even now, most people don't know about bitcoin or don't understand it.
Most people are hostile towards things they don't understand.
I believe bitcoin currently spreads on the peripheries of our society, especially in the following groups:
- Tech savvy, well-educated, individuals
- Risk tolerant investors
- Groups which highly value freedom 
Most of the progress have been invisible for the majority of the population.

I guess then in your weird reality any investment can be considered as gamble...


it's all relative.

No, I think you're only a miserable being having no other "hobby" than talking complete nonsense about a particular technology.
