So this transaction just moves coin to itself, adding a 3883 Satoshi/vB of fee just to eat up space in the already overly full mempool. 
A Serious (mem)Pool Attack Manipulation - whoever is doing this, great job of demolishing some value here.

I think it's awesome! Thank you

Yes there are 117 heatsinks on each hashboard... 
@_date: 2017-02-06 01:33:28
Was it this one?
(Me likey)

nice article, usable to inform some of my non crypto friends about BTC... too bad the page is a bit ad riddled... Thx for sharing anyway
@_date: 2017-02-12 18:52:01
The Trezor also has a seed string you can write down and store somewhere safe so you will always be able to get your coins back...
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:36:25
Interesting... It's indeed a block full of simple transactions of the smallest size. It's related to this previous discussion: 
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:38:35
If this is some kind of distribution wallet from a large payout system (sending coin to all sorts of addresses, pretty much all of those unspent) then they've probably never heard of sendmany...

Horror with difficult to retrieve non accepted wire transfers are exactly why we're all switching to BTC... Unfortunately the FIAT part is still subject to all this. I hope your funds will be retrieved before BTC runs up.
With wire transfers it's extremely important to follow exactly to the dots on the i and the strikes through the t to get them to their final account quickly without troubles...
@_date: 2017-01-02 22:23:44
100% agreed. The way they describe it is wrong and also does not mention scarcity at all
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:25:32
.... and then there was ....
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:55:27
BCH still at 478558 probably for a very long time... 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:39:25
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:11:13
Can’t make this stuff up:  Block 478.478 is the last block mined before the official  enforcement of Aug 1 (UTC)
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:04:26
Yeah... I made that same mistake thinking block 478478 was the last of July31st but because of MTP....it wasn't :)
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:05:21
+1 on privkey
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:47:31
Found the answer already... The time shown is Median Time, which is a moving average over the last blocks. "MTP is a statistic calculated over 11 blocks, and trails behind wall clock time by about 6 blocks. This means that the last common block will be approximately the 6th block with a timestamp after 12:20pm. The block after that will be different on either chain."
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:38:48
Is the clock used on  off? The times it mentions when finding new blocks are odd...
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:52:54
Yep, just found that out too... Confusing, all these different time notations... Never a dull moment though...
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:15:16
It's an OK article but it is rather vague about the specifics... (What else is new :-) 
Still good to see renewed media attention.
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:03:16
There's more!

They cannot, but their accelerator basically puts priority on eligible transactions flagged into their system, which they will try include in the block they are working on currently. That way, when they find a block, it will include those accelerated transactions, which oftentimes are having way lower fees than the ones a pool would normally select
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:38:15
Sorry, got caught in the historic moment here... ViaBTC mined block 478559 which was the first one after Median Time 12.20PM UTC and it mined it on the original BTC chain, leaving the BCH chain at 478558 as can still be seen on 
@_date: 2016-12-14 23:00:18
Is this via Flexepin?
@_date: 2017-01-11 01:09:22
And this: 
I feel an app coming up to use this way of communication!

A good friend of ours created this Bitcoin song to bring some positive vibes to these interesting times
Hope you enjoy

Time will tell - just found it funny people already panic after one day of a mild (I think healthy) correction
@_date: 2019-12-21 06:04:53
A loud atm probably...
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:30:24
Just be careful as they seem to want you to put in your private keys when I looked at this. Big nono in my books. Not sure if they changed this. Also look up their address, it's at a cheap business registry in London with a bunch other companies including a pizza place.

The lightning network already works with millisatoshis to expand the possibility of micro payments. To settle these on the blockchain they'll have to go in batches of whole satoshis. It's fun playing around and testing this, now that fees are very low to open and close channels on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:29:11
True. I just hope they mine there because it's an awesome spot on the map...
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:37:37
Well... in the lightning network the millisat is the smallest unit so that's what I went with. Let's hope that'll be valuable at some point then we'll all do really well
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:38:04
Looks to me like the geographical middle of Canada, probably as a result of an IP that only reveals Canada as geolocation. Still pretty cool to using a bunch of miners there as a heating system if the location actually is some place... Just my 2 millisatoshis...
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:21:44
While funding a channel for lightning mainnet I just had a transaction go through at 0.483 sat/B for a rather large number of inputs. Gotta love it! 
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:04:07
It's a scam? Oh man... there goes my chance to become a member of the Royal Warrant Holders Assiciation
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:31:24
Nah... I have switched my reference system completely over to crypto  :) 2 millisatoshis it is (because I find LN a cool thing)
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:04:14
I think they forgot to include a change address in a rawtransaction. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:30:59
Try to play around building a transaction that includes exactly the 2 change txo's and preview it to see if there's no dust being formed before attempting to sign and broadcast. You could maybe hit two birds with one stone
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:50:54
You can try a child pays for parent fee transaction. If you have control over the receiving end, try spending one of the unconfirmed outputs in a transaction that has a high fee, something like 2 or 3 times the normal (high) fee. This way the whole chain will confirm once a miner picks up the high paying child transaction. Make sure you set the electrum advanced options for manual fee so you can override the default settings.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:26:23
Was discussing digital currency and inflationary currencies with my son, which made him point me to this funny sketch where the value of a currency is used as weapon against an enemy government. I never saw it before, it's a tad dark but funny nonetheless. So glad we have alternatives to govt issued currency today....
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:34:40
The extreme high fees were only in 2 transactions and I think those were result of a faulty system that forgot a change address so all change turned into fee by mistake. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:26:03
Wow found another one that looks very similar just a few blocks ago. Same sorta thing,  paying 32000+ satoshis per byte probably because of a faulty system that does not insert a change address so all change is considered fee. OUCH
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:29:03
Aye... that's too bad. How about trying the same thing for your first transaction  looks like the 0.0033 BTC should not be considered dust, methinks
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:11:39
Sending .002 is not feasible anymore with the current state of Bitcoin.... Something's gotta change for sure
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:32:52
Have you previewed the transaction to see if there's indeed dust being formed? Maybe you can fiddle around with the numbers while keeping previewing the transactions until you get something that might resolve
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:46:37
Looks like the top 2 transactions are wallet consolidations gone awfully wrong. Bixin raked in a nice 30 BTC extra in this block.... Surely this one confirmed straight in the first available block
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:08:03
In this transaction: 129b7b6f2e501828e49e106168ae09e2b0cf4c9d174c3f80d8603d536d71a0e7
The 1CDMr5rbBkzrQr3BMPpiuPmop88XaiFE5G looks like the change address which should be in your wallet. If you try sending that funds from that unspent address to yourself including a high fee, that should help
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:32:46
Another thing that drives me nuts is the insane amount of scam related transactions that move someone's "investment" into a collector address while applying a high fee which is always the same fixed fee of 0.0008 BTC for a 191 or 192 Byte transaction just so that the funds move faster into the ponzi. Lots of blocks have up to 10% of those types of transactions in them now. This is starting to become a serious problem as well but no one seems to take notice...
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:39:17
Makes one think indeed if there are algos used to create blockfillers just for that purpose. Fill up the 400+ Sats/B space strategically to keep the high fees flowing in
@_date: 2017-06-04 21:11:37
26.3 kB of small outputs all to the same address with a fee of over 600 Satoshi/B doesn't look like it has any purpose at all other than to keep the blocks full.
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:31:00
This is another block full of transactions by some faulty system that forgets to add a changeaddress to their rawtransaction... As a result the 6 or so BTC per transaction now doesn't get returned to the changeaddress but instead is designated as fee. I've noticed transactions like that before and by the looks of it whatever system it is, it isn't fixed yet. OUCH.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:48:11
What wallet do you use?
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:02:13
That's right. It's a very costly mistake though... They did 3 transactions with this type of mistake today. I'm sure they'll fix it but have a rotten day because of it :(
