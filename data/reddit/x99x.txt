Many of the bitcoin fanatics fail to grasp the nuance of how the world actually works.  Like you point out, complex systems and regulations didn't appear in a vacuum, but instead are responses to real-world problems.  
Unless Bitcoin is adapted to function within the existing financial framework it will fail.  Sadly for these guys, if you adapt Bitcoin for that, it really becomes no better than the existing currency system, and it fails for that reason.  There just isn't any place for Bitcoin in legitimate enterprise, which is why it mainly appeals to libertarian wingnuts.

You mean **THE** Charles Evans who taught introductory business classes at the world renowned powerhouse business school Florida Atlantic University?
I'm sure the rest of the world's elite economists will have no choice but to get behind bitcoin now.  I mean when **Charles Evans** gets on board people stand up and take notice.

why?  They were saying all along their plan was to introduce a bitcoin etf.

It would probably be wise to share your development background and team leadership experience to attract capable members.  From the description it sounds like a lot of "idea" talk which can come off as a red flag to some developers.  Just my two cents.

Because BTC is a purely speculative endeavor with no tangible value to support a stabilized price.

The company processing the transactions is Coin.Co LLC.  In a remarkable twist, they are represented by the same law firm that now accepts bitcoin.

You're right.  Who cares if your bitcoin expert was convicted of selling explosives on ebay and sentenced to 10 months in federal prison followed by three years of supervised release.  Totally not relevant to his 'expert' views on bitcoin and the totally unsubstantiated predictions he made.  Whatever it takes to maintain interest in bitcoin right?

Maybe people believe that bitcoiners are pushing bitcoin everywhere just they can drive up the price and make a buck.

After watching r/bitcoin with fascination for some time, this is typical behavior.  They rally around anyone with a semblance of financial background that likes bitcoin.  The guy in this article is basically a nobody but you see the kind of hero worship that flows his way just because he makes a quotable statement on bitcoin.

For comparison the gold SPDR ETF has a ratio of 0.4% with around $30 billion under management.  This trust will have a substantially smaller amount under management.  The expense ratio could be much higher than 0.4%, particularly given the absence of competition.
The larger point is that these guys will be able to cash in a large block of bitcoin by selling off the etf shares which is probably the primary motivation.

It doesn't happen and market cap is not the correct term to use here.
Derivatives are contracts between two entities to hedge/speculate for/against various events.  For example banks can use derivatives to protect against changing interest rates and manufacturers can use derivatives to minimize the impact of price fluctuations in raw materials/commodities.  
The total value of these contracts (ie a contract to buy steel in March 2015 for $50 million) is what adds up to the multi-trillion dollar derivatives market total.  It does not represent a "market cap" and the derivatives market is not something bitcoin or any other single asset can supplant.

Dogecoin searches increased by 239,842% (70 vs 167,960) during the same period so using your impeccable logic the future of Dogecoin is much brighter than Bitcoin.

Ever noticed how companies that actually make ~~money~~ *intelligent decisions* have a lukewarm interest in accepting bitcoin?

So people are printing out their bitcoin now to hide from hackers?  Does anyone else realize how absurd this sounds for the "currency of the internet"?
