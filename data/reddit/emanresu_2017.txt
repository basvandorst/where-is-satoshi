Have a read of the privacy FAQ:  . It's mostly open source, and getting pretty close to full open source. Man in the middle is not really relevant. It's just grabbing balances off the blockchain which are all public anyway. Also, it's in the app store so there is a higher level of trust seeing that Microsoft and Google vet all the apps.

Trezor or also open source. I will definitely look in to Coldcard. The only thing about that is that it doesn't seem to support many coins.

You like to keep it simple? That's understandable.
But, Hardfolio is mostly about tying together balances from multiple coins. That's the main thing that Hardfolio does that the wallet software doesn't generally do by itself.
Nonetheless, I'm adding this to the roadmap so that you can aggregate Coldcard Bitcoin with other hardware wallets.

Hope so. I've been hearing more about Coldcard. The firmware is open source that will make it easier to understand the protocol. What's attractive about these wallets? Do you have a preferred one?

You're agreeing with me. The timing was the important part. That's the thing that is suspicious. My guess is that they did it to cause the dip in the market. 
Why'd you'd bother trying work on damage control is well beyond me but knock yourself out.

Look, you obviously like defending credit card companies, so if you want to peddle that, that's fine. 
The point of the matter is that a bunch of credit card companies got together and changed the merchant code at the same time. That is very suspicious, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they knew that this would cause a dip in the market which would allow them to buy up. It's just obvious.

I have no idea if you're a shill or not (if you're not a shill, why would you bother sticking up for credit companies?) But that's totally irrelevant. 
You're not getting it. Yes. I can see that from a credit card provider's point of view , giving away free money for people to buy crypto doesn't make sense. But, that's not the issue. The issue is that a whole bunch of providers did it at the same time, and then the market crashed. Coincidence? Possibly. But, it certainly looks extremely suspicious. If you don't get that, you're too dense to see the problem.

You could look at it that way. But more like "shit! The finance sector just gobbled up a tonne of crypto while we got caught with our pants down because we can't pay the credit card debt we bought the coin with"

Whichever way you look at it, if you're suddenly accruing extra interest because the credit card merchant suddenly decided that you're making cash advances, there's a good chance it's going to be harder for you to make the repayments.

Many credit providers did this at the same time. That is very suspicious. This happened over a few weeks before the huge dip. I have to wonder to what extent, this was an attempt to force the price of Bitcoin down so that large financial institutions have a chance to buy crypto at a low price. I know that there are already class action lawyers investigating this.

I disputed the charge with my bank and they took the charge off.
