I think this is good for crypto. But remember you dont own the btc you buy. They do. You can't withdraw in BTC.
EDIT: u/trsra checked that you can withdraw the BTC. Sorry for miss information.

That’s great for what happened last week. But please.. we need to get this better. 
How much was the game? I guess 1 dollar is good. But this could be a lot lower. 2018 is going to be a decisive year to btc. Currency or Gold v2 or the best of both world

Both will probably win

Ok I really need to learn more about lightning network. Didn’t realize that you had to be monitoring the transaction ..

There is no general consensus.. Bitcoin is a super volatile asset, but it’s still a drop in the ocean of the money in the world. 
In the next year a LOT of money is coming to bitcoin. That will give us a boost.
I think you can look at it like this: 
If bitcoin serves it’s purpose as Gold v2 and keeps growing and solving its scalability problems you can expect great returns. 
If bitcoin keeps having his issues and not coming up the solutions, sooner or later the problems will overcome the good things and it will crash hard.
TLDR - If you hold 10 BTC you can expect to be rich in the next couple of years. Or you can expect to have 10BTC that are nothing.

I still have a stop loss order for 9100 active and cant cancell it, it didnt even fill.

No.

Given that you usually use btc to pay for stuff I would advise you that in the upcoming weeks you just use ETH. BTC is currently under attack. 
Solutions are coming. They are not imminent. Try to work something out with eth. 
I love the path that btc is taking as a store of value. But it’s not the best peer to peer transaction for those kind of amounts.
PS: This subreddit is becoming ridiculous. I enjoy memes like everybody else. I love investing. But please acknowledge that BTC was firstly designed to do fast peer to peer transactions for low fees.

Shhhhuuuu, She doesn’t need to know... keep holding ��

Don’t kick yourself for selling.. 
Only sell if 
- You need the money 
- You don’t believe it’s going up more.
If you want to feel bad for yourself, be because you didn’t buy more when you could 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:44:40
I guess that is right..

23?! That's a great age to buy bitcoin! Buy what you can now then keep adding more. I personally have 20% of my income going to a diversified portfolio of stocks / bonds and occasionally I buy more BTC. 
If at 30 you own 1, 2 or 3 BTC you wont regret. Don't forget to make an emergency account with +- 6 months of salary. Research about personal finance on your own but I think it's pretty good advice. I even advise you to head to r/personalfinance

Miller back at it again.. He is known to do this kinds of “bullish” bets. But 30%? That not a bet, that’s value investing. He is believing boyyyyss.
