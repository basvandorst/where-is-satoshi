We will, thanks for your suggestion :)
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:42:25
We allows users the choice to generate the HD seed on the device (more security) or the app (more convenience). 
@_date: 2018-08-31 01:50:46
We will definitely bring this up to our development team, thanks for the suggestions :)

Yes, the screen displays bitcoin addresses. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:26:17
We use a native app for iOS and Android. And yes, we use a mnemonic recovery method, just like any other wallet - including the Model T. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:24:25
Yes, it's quite secure.
* **Hardware-Based Root of Trust**: Our hardware wallet has a secure element to store private keys and process transactions. This security component is dedicated to protect sensitive information against a wide range of physical and remote attacks.
* **Layered Security and Defense in Depth**: Multiple security countermeasures are in place to address a wide range of potential attacks in the case an attacker steals your hardware wallet, roots the device with malicious firmware, or otherwise compromises your mobile devices.
* **Transaction Display and Confirmation**: Our hardware wallet is equipped with a trusted display for verifying the transaction information as well as on-device buttons for confirming or denying transactions.
* **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Digital certificates securely update the firmware and enable the device to conduct remote attestation.

Agreed. We warn users in abundance about these dangers. The app side is a more convenient option because it drastically reduces the effort and time to set up their wallet.    
But giving users a choice on how they want to use the wallet is core to our values and better reflects the needs of the diverse bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:05:03
We also have an app for iOS too :)

Hi  we're CoolBitX, maker of the CoolWallet S. Nice of you to have smart, informed questions. Let us do our best  to answer these questions:   


It's connect to iOS and Android devices via Bluetooth connection; a connection secured by a two encryption layers, including a 56\-decimal hash function.


The wallet comes with a native app for iPhone or Android devices. You can write your seed there \(written on your seed recovery card, of course\) and confirm it by pressing a button on the card. 


It shows the entire address on the card.


The user is the final piece in the transaction protocol.  You'll be prompted to provide either your finger print, face, or password to confirm any transaction. By then, you would have already confirmed the transaction by visually checking the amount and the address on the wallet's screen and pressing a manual button on the card to confirm the transaction. We call this 2\+1 Factor Authentication.   
If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:17:59
We've sold over 100,000 wallets since December 2017, backed by $13 million USD funding round from SBI Holdings. Yes, it's a legit product.

I'm sorry for my mistake, I'm just the PR guy and I should have double checked that with our security specialist.

On the card.


Yes, the unsigned transaction is sent to the card either via NFC or via BLE.


 
The CoolWallet can generate the private keys using the Secure Element chip following the BIP-32, BIP-43 and BIP-44 standards.
 
About the seed generation, some people might prefer to generate a BIP-39 (mnemonic words combination) compatible wallet which we can't do on the CoolWallet due to display constraints. So you can either generate the seed in the CoolWallet (in a unique number set format) or generate the more common BIP-39 mnemonic words combination format as your seed on your phone in the App. We are working on how to best do this securely and it will likely involve standalone device for seed input.
 


In the scenario where the seed is generated on the CoolWallet:
"A True Random Number Generator (TRNG) specially designed for smart card applications is
implemented. The TRNG fulfils the requirements from the functionality class PTG2 of the AIS31
and produces genuine random numbers which then can be used internally or by the user software."
The True Random Number Generator in the Secure Element chip generates the seed. If you're interested, you can find out more about the Secure Element in the Common Criteria protocol document [here](

@_date: 2015-01-31 13:43:43
We'll be implementing a portion of the Bitcoin address for visual verification on the CoolWallet.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:56:09
Thanks! We have spent a *lot* of time getting the design right so we hope you'll like it if you choose to get one. We're going to launch a crowd funding campaign on Indigogo next week!
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:42:58
Thanks! I wasn't too sure about that, but what you say makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-29 15:29:25

Thanks! We're launching our Indigogo campaign in a couple of days where we'll have more details. For now, you can find some more details on [our website!](
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:52:24
Thanks! Please keep in mind that the payment process will be simplified over time to be just TapTap. We'll need to work with Bitcoin payment processors to develop point of sale hardware but this is the next step.
@_date: 2015-01-29 12:10:49

We're addressing this issue by implementing a portion of the Bitcoin address for visual verification on the CoolWallet.
@_date: 2015-01-31 11:03:40
We're very confident that our security on the CoolWallet is impenetrable to hackers.
Our security mechanism prevents hackers from changing anything in the Secure Element, including the receiving address.
We also think that the Bitcoin address is not a convenient identifier for people to need to visually match when paying.
EDIT: To address the security concerns raised, we *will* display a portion of the receiving Bitcoin address. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 18:15:10
No, it uses an accelerometer.

We seriously considered crowd-funding on Lighthouse but we chose to go with Indigogo because of a broader audience and Lighthouse is still pretty early in beta development.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:27:03
You need to use either your phone and the CoolWallet, or your computer and the CoolWallet. We expect most of our customers will be wanting to use the CoolWallet to make payments on the go and everyone already carries their phone with them.
We know the process in this video looks a bit confusing (it's the engineering version!) but don't worry, we're working on making it a lot simpler and faster.
It will be as easy as scan merchant's QR code, or choose an address from your address book, then TapTap or press the button to pay!
@_date: 2015-01-29 16:09:43
We're excited about Lighthouse too but we don't want to test the system if bugs are a reasonable possibility.
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:31:39
You will be able to help us fulfil this project by buying it with Bitcoin on [our website!]( (Will be implemented very soon!)
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:15:44
We think this is the best way to stop hacks. Thanks for your feedback though, we are considering hiding the OTP process in the next generation.
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:13:39


You will need to buy a new one. However, we'll give generous discounts to existing owners in a loyalty program. We're also working on an exchange where you'll be able to trade safely, storing the bitcoins in cold storage the whole time.




Sure, at initialization the seed can either be generated on the CoolWallet as a number set format, which follows the BIP-32, BIP-43 and BIP-44 standards, or, generated following the BIP-39 mnemonic standard.
The restoration process is in development.


Yes, we will have an API with command line tools.

@_date: 2015-01-29 13:43:07
The screen is very durable and will definitely survive pressure from sitting on it inside your wallet. It's also flexible to 15 degrees and waterproof!
@_date: 2015-01-31 15:51:20
Any functionality that depends on a central service (such as our Apps on iOS and Android and software on computers) will be open source. We will work on Electrum compatibility/functionality as well.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:48:26
It's extremely safe.
The platform uses a security framework developed by Infineon Technologies, who are a global company based in Germany.
From the the Common Criteria evaluation paper that validates our security model:


and peripherals. The major components of the core system are the 32-bit CPU (Central
Processing Unit), the MPU (Memory Protection Unit), the MED (Memory Encryption/Decryption
Unit), the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC), the Instruction Stream Signature Checking
(ISS) and the Cache system. The Secure Element contains the co-processors for RSA/EC (Crypto2304T) and
DES/AES (SCP) processing, a CRC module and the peripherals random number generator, four
timers and two watchdog timers and several external interface services. All data of the memory
block is encrypted, RAM and ROM are equipped with an error detection code (EDC) and the
Infineon® SOLID FLASH™ is equipped in addition with an error correction code (ECC).
The memories are connected to the Core with the AXITM Memory Bus and the peripherals are
connected with the APBTM Peripheral Bus.
[See more about the general features of the hardware chip here]( or if you'd like to read more of the technical details in the Common Criteria validation paper (EDIT) [you can get it here.] (

@_date: 2015-01-29 15:26:34
Yes, but for our existing customers we will introduce a loyalty program.
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:25:07
Hi there, thank you for your feedback! We understand our product is not for everyone, but we're committed to making Bitcoin easier to use and with very high security standards.
In the interest of transparency, we use Infineon's Smart Card IC SLE97 libraries with a Crypto2304T Asymmetric Cryptographic Processor.
We utilize a Common Criteria EAL 5+ certified chip (Secure Element) to protect the private keys from hacker probing. By using this chip we can not open the firmware to the public.
We as the (Secure Element developer) needed to sign Non Disclosure Agreements with the chip vendor to obtain the development environment and confidential documents. On the other hand, you can treat us as a trust worthy company that has the trust of the SE vendor, who choose their developers strictly.

@_date: 2015-01-29 16:27:00
If your phone or laptop is compromised, the OTP is very important to prevent hackers from remotely requesting a transaction. It ensures the transactions can only be done by the CoolWallet holders. Remember you can just TapTap instead of entering numbers manually.
@_date: 2015-01-29 17:00:00
We seriously considered crowd-funding on Lighthouse but we chose to go with Indigogo because of a broader audience and Lighthouse is still pretty early in beta development.
We're going to be selling for Bitcoin on [our website]( so if you want to you can still help fund us.
**Open source**
Our mobile app, BLE chip and micro-controller unit on the CoolWallet will be open sourced, as well as the Bitcoin logic source on the Secure Element chip.
However, the cryptographic libraries that we use on the Secure Element  are under NDA so those will not be open sourced.
**Battery life**
Between charges: ~ Two weeks.
Total battery life: ~ Two years.
For Apple users, we can't implement NFC until they release the software libraries. iPhone users will be able to use the CoolWallet with Bluetooth with no issues.
**Security features**
They include WatchDog (if you leave your CoolWallet behind your phone will notify you), complete physical isolation of the private keys from the Internet, button on the card and one time password.

How does the Wallet know when to generate a one-time-password?


The one-time-password entered on the Phone. What does the Phone do then?
The one time password is needed for strong authentication. In this workflow, the phone sends a request to the CoolWallet which randomly generates the one time password and waits for the phone to send that matching password.
Once the CoolWallet is satisfied that the phone is authenticated, it will be able to sign the transaction. Think of it as a second factor authentication.

Although the the card can store thousands of accounts, we limited it to 5 for simplified management and we can only display 5 accounts on the screen.


No, cold storage will be sufficiently secure.

Your phone connects to CoolWallet via BLE (Bluetooth low energy). Earpieces that do this are through Bluetooth (without low energy).


We do this to protect your bitcoins in case your paired device gets hacked and is being controlled remotely.


Again, the idea that you need to type in a code on the phone adds something: protect your bitcoins if your paired device gets hacked and is being controlled remotely. Hackers cannot reach your CoolWallet so they cannot get the code and type it on the phone.


The TapTap is just a process that saves you time from having to manually type in the code on your phone. It is not required.


The second-factor-authentication takes some time to understand, but it makes the CoolWallet very secure and we believe we've made the process more convenient by having the TapTap function.


Indeed this product does require many highly technical skills. However, we guarantee you that these technologies have existed for years and that we are more than capable in producing the CoolWallet.


It's clear we have a bit more development work to do, particularly around the App User Interface and process optimisation. But we have demonstrated the hardware side of our product works!
We hope that by addressing your concerns we can reduce your scepticism. Thanks for your interest in the CoolWallet!
@_date: 2015-02-04 12:48:33


Although the phone and the battery are in constant connection, CoolWallet only receives communication when the phone sends requests. We tested the CoolWallet and the battery already lasts more than one week at current stage.


We already have application-layer encryption between the app and the wallet. However, for some users this is not enough.




This is different to your example of the banking website with password in the tooltip. The CoolWallet and phone are in separate environments.


We have a [demo video here](


We're actively looking for independent people to verify our product. If you are or know anyone who is suitably qualified, please send us an email. info at coolbitx dot com
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:37:55


Agreed. We'll be working on this!


We're also currently working on an exchange platform so traders can keep bitcoins safely on the CoolWallet and trade on the blockchain! Fiat balances would be managed by us.
