Pruning the ledger for everyone or only for some end-users that want to?
Because storage is cheap, and I would personally like the entire ledger. No reason not to keep all of it, even if it's not as decentralized as some would like.

I thought Gemini was near-impossible to get into?

Are you aware of what an anecdote is? It's hypothetically possible that only one transaction has ever gone smoothly with them and you're that one.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:52:13
What's a good alternative?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:14:34
It's inherently different than anything we've ever seen before, so it seems fair to approach *anything* about it with a fair amount of skepticism. It has no physical form, and more of it can be "found" at any time. (in extremely increasing difficulty, yes) 
Either way, it's not hurting anyone to say "if". You aren't a fortune teller so you can't declare my "if" to be somehow incorrect. It's how humans discuss uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:34:53
Regardless the reason, not available yet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:18:59
Well, obviously those people would get hurt the most. I'm just saying that if/when that bubble pops, anyone with any amount of bitcoin is going to lose. Yeah, anyone with diversified investments will probably walk away without losing much, but they'll be losing something.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:47:51
And as I already pointed out: this has sufficient differences from any of the historical events that we would normally reference, making it inherently unpredictable. I agree that it will likely happen, but you don't need to have a shit-fit over me saying "if". The differences are great enough to draw in uncertainty.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:52:48
I agree that it's likely following a pattern. I disagree that either of us can be certain about that, one way or the other.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:58
I'm saying the banks have their own internal rules. Not that they follow any overbearing government rules.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:24:44
I'm just saying that in general, rules are there. Hence, not really Somolia. Yeah, it's shitty that they're adding retarded rules on the fly, but there are still rules.

I believe they verify residency with driver's license, so good luck with that.

*Everyone* gets hurt if/when the bubble pops.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:23
I mean, American banks have rules, they're just usually shitty rules.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:58:09
Fair enough, thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-28 14:18:36
I'm sure they don't care all that much as long as I take down the illegal stuff. 
Subs like this already exist, I just made a new one because the other ones are all either too inactive, have inactive mods, or ban-happy mods.

Mind telling me how BTC will help in this? Is it expected that the worth will rise again?
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:18:01
No, I won't wait with bated breath for my heros to be torn down. I can accept news as it might come to light, but I won't expect it, because that unnecessarily sullys a memory.
@_date: 2014-10-23 23:05:11
Thanks, I'll give it a look.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:16:37
Fair points. As someone pursuing a career in freelance programming/web design, bitcoin seems great so far. People can't dispute transactions, and I can't get ripped off. I always considered myself an honest person, but I rarely trust others to show me the same courtesy.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:05:53
Why is that? The exchange rate affects everything. If I go to a hotdog stand that takes BTC, and I want to buy a hotdog, the vendor is going to want $5 worth of BTC no matter what, not a static amount of BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:02:48
Ok, fair enough. That's smart.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:57:46
Interesting theory. It definitely has some merit.
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:10:10
Ok, fair enough.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:51:12
Thanks! Here's to hoping it actually comes to fruition unlike most of the crypto-subreddits.
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:56:15
But even though you -- on average -- bought it for cheap, it's worth so much less now. What's the point? (In your opinion)
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:55:14
I love a lot about bitcoin, but if I get paid $50 worth of BTC tomorrow, and I want to spend it in a month, what's the point if I'm only going to have $40 worth?
@_date: 2014-12-09 18:36:43
The fact that it still hasn't happened might lead me to not believe them. So when is the world going to end? /s 
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:59:13
So you believe the price will rise again?
