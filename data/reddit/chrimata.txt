@_date: 2018-01-03 17:24:04
I think your second point isn't true at all. Non mining nodes are passive participants just checking blocks they receive are valid. They by definition don't have any say in the proof of work consensus
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:08:26
Sure. Keep posting memes and spreading misinformation about the basics of bitcoin then. I'm not going to argue with a wall
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:27:50
Yeah DHT predates bitcoin, it's from torrenting. That has nothing to do with whether full nodes participate in the consensus algorithm. They don't. They just passively check the signatures of blocks they receive and never create any
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:27:21
I consider a node which only receives blocks and checks that their hash is valid and does not produce any blocks itself to be a passive participant. You are calling this a full node. 
Your statement about consensus on rules doesn't make sense. The word consensus has a technical meaning here. What constitutes a valid transaction is determined 100% by the miners. It has nothing to do with transaction ordering unless you consider an attempted double spend an "out of order" transaction
It might be worth you rereading that white paper...

Yeah I'm not sure why they would add all of the other stuff lightning uses just to make an id system. None of the onion routing or AMP are needed for a decentralized id. I also think L2 is probably a catch all term for off chain

No because turing completeness already assumes an infinite memory tape. Our computers just "have enough" to call it essentially endless. Weaker computers are still turing complete
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:00:00
That's nothing to do with the instruction set's turing completeness. Also the script could be in multiple transactions

I had thought the instruction set for bitcoin had recently been shown to be turing complete. I'm not sure if that set includes disabled op codes or not. Completeness would mean any complexity contract could be implemented

An appeal to authority? We should believe BTCdrak because he's a member of Bitcoin Core?
I thought I was arguing against an appeal to authority :)
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:24:39
Thanks for answering! I think that's a huge problem then, for algorithms like A* the completeness guarantee means it needs to know all of the nodes and the weights of the edges to find the solution. 
The edge weights of the graph will be updating with each transaction. This is a huge problem!!
If the network grows too large a LN node CPU will be doing nothing but planning paths.
It also loses the completeness guarantee with the hop limit being there... this should be removed immediately it's in the spec!

Well it's relevant because it's false. There are many competitive GPU manufacturers. 
There are only two major GPU designers. Nvidia and AMD do not manufacture. 
For what it's worth, it's actually easier to manufacture a 16 nm ASIC than it is a general circuit like a 16 nm GPU.

This is only true if the new software update has gone through the package review process. It could also be true if you choose to trust a 3rd party ppa. People should be cautious in this space about trusting random ppas on the Internet
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:49:07
In terms of the blockchain yeah, the node can't write to it unless it has hash power. It only can check the blocks it got sent are real blocks. 
In terms of the network though it can do other stuff like if someone makes a new transaction the non mining node hears about, it can forward it along to other nodes so that eventually the person being paid and the miners hear about the new tx. A malicious node could intentionally not forward certain stuff. 
Ignore the people talking about economic activity. They don't know what they are talking about. Economic activity has nothing to do with the networking messages being sent. 
Your technical knowledge was right! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:20:15
BCH has it's own issues. As does dogecoin. Right now no one has scaled up to high transactions. 
No one is ignorant that the network split happened either. I was just contrasting one solution with another on the basis that they are competing solutions. 
Zero conf transactions are a feature that was added by Satoshi so it's a more plausible micro transaction solution than whatever doge is doing - if any
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:05:13
I'm not sure how many ways I can rephrase the same statement, but there are more than 2 GPU manufacturers
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:10:39
Neither of those papers deal with what lighting is doing. LN the edges on the graph (links between nodes) change weight with each tx sent. This is a much harder problem than routing in general or even TOR
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:55:28
Well in that case a trademark dispute would make that come down. The ford.com owner would need some fair reason he could keep it. 
I think this happened to nissan or someone a few years ago. Someone named mr nissan bought the domain and the court ruled he got to keep it. 
Bitcoin can't be trademarked though because it's a network protocol. Even if it could, bitcoin.com promoting bitcoin cash is likely fair enough a court would say they could keep it
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:56:14
Hi I have a question about the routing here: 
What path planning algorithm is being used? Do you know what the plan is for the hop limit when more nodes are added to the network? 
Specifically I'm concerned about a central hub blocking a transaction using this hop limit. If the tx needs to route around an adversary it needs to do it in a few hops otherwise the tx is blocked. This is especially true for larger transactions as it will need multiple paths. The liquidity will be smaller for near-leaf nodes. 
Does the path really need to be replanned for every transaction? In routing for the Internet the bandwidth of a link does not change for each packet that goes through. For lightning the liquidity does change for each transaction. It seems like this problem grows geometrically with each new node making payments
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:21:23


That's your own personal trust tolerance. I personally don't trust anonymous strangers on the Internet for shit. Who knows if that screen name is even a real person
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:07:08
With TOR the bandwidth of the link it is running on does not change. Worth LN each tx uses some of the liquidity. LN is a much harder problem
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:20:33
Right, I'm familiar with the ASICboost stuff. Still not sure about halong being real. Not enough detail from them. Either way they hardly have any mining volume yet and are not disrupting monopolies anytime soon. I'm looking at Samsung and GMO since they are big outside of crypto
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:40:27
They could sell the private key not on the blockchain and it would never be made public
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:18:30
Yeah the threat is on them being able to get your private key from the public one. 
The search space for sha256 is reduced to 2^128 with QCs but even though that's a massive amount ASICs will be much better at mining for decades due to cost. 
All of this is on the article on QC on the bitcoin wiki. You are right the person you're replying to probably hasn't read that
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:46:28
They would. It was a 3rd possibility
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:14:15
Nvidia and AMD have a fabless business model. They outsource manufacture to other fabrication foundries like TSMC and GlobalFoundries. TSMC is the largest but there is more competition than 2. They also don't solely make mining equipment like bitmain. Bitmain is buying the wafers from TSMC and importing them to China
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:01:01
Hey I had a long weekend! I wanted to reply to you earlier but I wanted to give you the time for a thoughtful response. 


I'm sorry too, I realized afterwards I probably came off as someone who was coming into the party thread and trying to rain on the parade. 
I'm sure this took many months of development efforts and hard work. You guys should celebrate :)
Honestly the vitrol caused by the forking I think is one of the worst things to happen to bitcoin. 
I think since so much money has been pouring into the space it inevitably became a political disagreement rather than a technical one. 
I won't hide that I'm in the BCH camp but I think that a lot of the hate LN gets is undeserved and is animosity people are feeling towards bitcoin core being projected. 
Building logical layers on top of bitcoin will be a great thing, even if ChrimataCoin or StileCoin ended up being the base layer in the end.  
There are probably tons of applications that can be built that people can't imagine yet, similar to how the designers of Ethernet would never have anticipated how much HTTP is used today.
I just hope the cooler heads on both sides will prevail. I think all of the new people pouring into the space isn't helping the tribalism. People are tending to buy one coin or another and dumping on perceived competitors instead of trying to promote the tech of the whole space 


The path planning layer was logically below an upper layer where the robots were working together in a swarm algorithm and the incompleteness was breaking the upper layer application. They should have been logically separate, and they are now that I fixed it!
I can PM you a link to the thesis if you like, I published it open access. I just don't want to doxx myself on reddit


Ah I see. The smaller or larger message size would let them know the path length. It's how many layers there are on the onion and you need to pretend they are all the same size. I wonder if you could have nodes add layers as well as remove them?
Say there are 20 slots, the second node decrypts his slot and instead of just seeing where to send it to node 3, he also sees node 21(also stored in his slot) and encrypts slot 2 again with slot 21's public key. That way the slots get treated like a ring buffer. 
It leaks one path node modulo the slot length, but only in the case where the path is longer




















All great points. I'm sure you guys will be prioritizing stuff as it becomes apparent what's needed from real use


Hmmm doesn't this involve trusting whoever is running the subnet? I'm envisioning a NAT-like setup where instead of planning a path to who I'm paying, my path is to my default gateway


I see so the liquidity is reserved until the payment reaches the end. Have you seen the IEEE time sensitive networking standards? They add to Ethernet a bandwidth reservation for streaming high priority traffic in real time. Mostly being used for audio and video right now. In a similar vein to LN, there is an aspect of "can't play the video right now" if the bandwidth for the stream can't be reserved end to end. 802.1Q clause 34 I believe


I didn't mean to come off as demanding a change :) I'm just a person who is vocal about my opinion. You're right though, I only have a partial set of info so it limits how valuable that opinion can be. If there's a mailing list or something I would love to subscribe and keep tabs


Yes it does, I'm not sure it will be a substitute for the guarantee though. It might end up being the LN causes researchers to look at the problem more because there's now a real world application. An algorithm with a completeness guarantee for path weights that change would be powerful. Perhaps since the channels are bounded in weight by the amount of funds a guarantee can still be found


Oh interesting. Is it using the block header for the timestamp? I'm not sure if there are tight requirements on the timestamp. I think I remember something vague like it just needs larger than the last timestamp. Though I'm not sure if there have been any timestamp based bitcoin attacks yet. 


I bet! Good luck and happiness to you both :)

Isn't halong just a bitmain reseller? The miner looks exactly like the S9 but with a halong logo. 
They have a slightly higher advertised hash rate but they might just be overclocking the s9.
If this is the first batch they ship we get to find out if it's a scam company or not right? 
Bitmain is one of the largest purchasers of wafers from TSMC. I wouldn't call it a "disrupted" monopoly haha. 
The hash rate drops of the pools might just be miners switching to the BCH chain. The article doesn't even mention that possibility
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:50:15
I believe this is the node breakdown:  
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:43:15
Oooh neat. If you don't mind me asking, what was the total cost of the setup?
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:35:53


Doesn't this mean that the path I just planned to the person I'm paying might not be valid anymore? What happens to the payment I sent when it hits the node that just ran out of liquidity? 


Without this the user might stay in a state where they can't make payments to a specific person forever


The failure rate will grow as the network grows because the centrally connected nodes will have more demand for their liquidity. Without completeness nodes won't be able to find "the path less traveled" and will use these big nodes a lot. 
It's a nontrivial problem to figure out who person A should open a channel with to optimally improve routing


I don't know what AMP is but everything I just learned makes me super skeptical on LN :(


To be adopted it needs to be useful and to be useful it needs to compete with other crypto payment methods, most notably zero conf transactions on BCH.
These problems of completeness and multiple agent path planning are on the forefront of CS research and aren't easily dismissed by saying "we probably don't need it" you know? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:38:02
That would be interesting. I'm not sure why halong wouldn't just buy them and resell though. ASICs take multiple years to design. Look how long it took bitmain to get to 16nm

I'm still not really sure what your point is, it's not like AMD would limit what programs can be run with their chip. I was just pointing out you're oversimplifying the situation saying there's only two. It's totally different from the ASIC market where the logic can be patented
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:50:26

I thought we were having an academic discussion. I asked you why you felt justified in ignoring a guarantee that's been a cornerstone of that field of computer science since 1956 and your response was "lol"?

It seems like he defended his idea well. Seems totally reasonable to use cryptographic proof you possess some other resource on the network
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:44:20
You should forward the port to the internal IP address running your node so that only that application allows others on the Internet to connect to you. Small detail, but security wise it's the difference between opening the door to anyone and opening the door to just bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:59:36


I was. Is there any evidence in the real world that they are not just a bitmain reseller? 


I guess it's controversial not to trust anonymous people online? Like if that guy's account got hacked how would you know who is the real BTCdrak


Some people's threshold for optimism is higher than others. I would love if there's more competition in the mining space, I just think it's more likely to come from multi billion dollar companies like Samsung


Ok, if you want to be mean for some reason
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:14:59


Hey I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. I'm not sure what basis you think I'm a troll other than I disagreed. I'm genuinely curious about the path planning. 
I actually saw your account tagged on twitter for LN announcements and I was like hey this is the guy I was just arguing with on reddit! I saw you're a contractor for lightning labs. I retract my snarky quotations of expert! 


I actually did my thesis on multiple agent path planning for robots working cooperatively. I initially actually made the same assumption - I didn't need an algorithm with the completeness guarantee for my specific application. I got burned by it and lost 5 months of work switching to a new algorithm. 
The completeness guarantee has been a cornerstone of the field since the 1950s and I found out the hard way it shouldn't be shrugged off lightly. 


The hop limit will impose incompleteness on an algorithm even if it does have a completeness guarantee. It's not allowed to search deeper into the tree than the hop limit. Even if a solution exists down there it's not allowed to find it. I just find it interesting that algorithm implementation is left up to the client, but if I want to choose an algorithm with completeness the spec doesn't allow me to. 
If there's high congestion along one of the main paths to the destination I might try an alternate lower liquidity route (or multiple with AMP). This isn't allowed to be more than 20. Maybe 20 is enough, maybe it's not. Depends entirely on the network topology and congestion at the time. Hard to know beforehand.
I think you mentioned too that path changes aren't propagated for each transaction? Its a catch 22. If lightning network scales to thousands or millions of users you might see this bite you for having incomplete state planning the path, if you do propagate changes its probably like O(n^2) or something crazy. The client would be constantly updating


Is rollback and retry what happens when the race condition occurs? 
If I planned a path and then sent the money the liquidity of the path might change during the transmission. I'm assuming there's some mechanism to return the money if the path fails. It's a more complicated race condition with AMP too since only part of the payment fails. 
There's a race condition returning the money too since the path you took on the way here likely has the liquidity but doesn't necessarily if a payment went through after your packet. The graph doesn't necessarily have bidirectional edges. 


Well academically speaking, not all of the path planning researchers and professors are subscribed to the lightning network mailing list. Your peer group is larger than that. 
My huge problems thoughts were based on seeing the hop limit in the spec for onion routing and knowing that limits completeness. I originally asked about the path planning and you said the guarantee isn't needed. I still think that's a huge problem. 


Hey congrats! That's really cool. What's an HTLC construct? 
I'm not sure I would have made the connection unless the paper citation uses your reddit name!


I saw when I found your twitter that you just had a baby! Congratulations! That's really exciting, I hope you and your family are very happy :)
