first of all I don't think a fed agent would try to get info off of a forum on how to try to hack bitcoin.  Sounds like you have a pretty big ego and a lot of time on your hands.

I agree both points but an agent wouldn't be looking for something like this.  By the way stop flooding my post.  Maybe someone has actual content to provide.

Everybody make mistakes except for you.  You're the best and will most likely be king of the world one day.  How old are you again?  Why didn't you want to PM me again?  You couldn't bully me on PM like you can on the forum?

This is my wallet.  Coinomi doesn't require a pw when sending to wallet and I sent it from coinbase.   I haven't used the wallet for 3 months and forgot.  I cant believe it myself.

I've been looking for the last 2 weeks  I wasn't planning on keeping the funds in the coinomi wallet for very long.  Im not using that wallet again until they change their configuration.   Every other wallet requires password before you open wallet.

for coinomi they are 18 words.  I did, I remember I wrote it down in my car but cant find the paper.

id be fine with paying for a cracker that works.  Did you make the application yourself and can you upload your own dictionary?  Why don't you sell the program on the web?  There are only 3 out there that I know of and they wont support coinomi or mycelium wallet files.
