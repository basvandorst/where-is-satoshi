If you can time the market then selling high is clearly a no brainer.  But get it wrong and your left sitting by the side lines praying for a crash. Loads of people sold high for the '10k dip'. Btc is currently down 30% ish so do you sell now, hodl, buy more? Personally I'll take my chances and hold and cost average into this dip.

Its party time! The last thing most people want to be doing on nye is trading. I expect I might have the odd glance at blockfolio but thats about it.

Mellenials as a group have been somewhat disadvantaged. Playing to division is the oldest trick in the book and more does not help, it will just be exploited. Btc/crypto can play a huge part in solving some of the problems we all face. It may also come with its own problems so we need to expose and understand the reality of the issues at hand as clearly and objectively as we can.

No explaination and you have to wait 10 days?wtf! That's absurd. Disgraceful that a bank can do that. I'd seel advice and get in touch with the ombudsmen first thing today. 
Btw if its any help Ive been sending gbp from Lloyds to revolut, converting to euro, sending euro from revolut to fire bank and then from fire onto Kraken. 0 fees and takes 1-2 days. It just takes a bit of time to get set up.

If bitcoin (or another coin) can eventually succeed in its original purpose then that will make it valuable in itself. For it to work as peer to peer digital cash, by definition it has to have a value and therefore also function as a store of value. In the meantime it will inevitably face obstacles, attract speculators and go through a process of development. The most important thing is that the story and technoligical principles of its creation survive.

If Ledger ever went under and stopped support, is there still a way of accessing your keys?

Trustless, decentralised, peer to peer, incorruptable. Thats what gives bitcoin its value. Blockchain was invented because our institutions and governments can not be trusted.

I'm in the uk. I buy btc on Kraken although you can only trade there with euros so... I transfer gbp from my uk bank account to Revolut and convert to euros (Revolut allows exchange to euros at or close to the international exchange rate). You cant deposit to Kraken from Revolut so next i tranfer euros from Revolut to Fire bank and from fire to Kraken. Its does take a week or two to get these set up due to kyc, making some test deposits etc but it doesn't cost anything. Bit long winded but once its set up it only takes around 2 days to complete a deposit.

The crazy thing is we need to be reminded of this. Equally as crazy is that most people probably haven't ever thought this through
