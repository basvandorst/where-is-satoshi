Money or no money. Any time you can claim ownership for a resource the ability to create slaves is there. Bitcoin doesn't create slaves anymore then this guys pretend resource based economy does.

Agreed bitcoin wouldn't have been attainable by a good portion of people without Coinbase.  There were 0 other places you buy bitcoin directly back in the day. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 00:43:30
again. none of those exchanges did direct bank transactions. you could not use your credit/debit card to buy bitcoin on those exchanges. 
I'm not saying that coinbase was the first exchage I'm saying it was the one of the first if not the first to allow direct bank transactions without having to wire money or go through any 3rd party hoops.

Not sure what you're talking about but yes as far as ease of transactions coin-base was by ahead of pretty much everyone out there. You buy the coins with a credit/debit card then get them without having to wait a million years or talk to some local bitcoin fanatic, send off a moneygram or moneyorder. It was a pain in the ass to buy bitcoin back in 2011,
Coinbase made it available to those who aren't just in the know about where to get them or how to buy them.

We have maybe 5 or 10 years before quantum computers are able to crack any encryption tech. they already are getting very close. Once that happens all encryption is useless including bitcoin.  the speed of transactions also couldn't keep up with the smallest credit card company's transactions a second and the lightning network helps but it's far from an ideal fix and overly complicating a process that's already complicated to most non tech people which is going to always stop wide spread adoption

Only 50,000,000 to go before being 1/4 of visa transactions per day!

There is literally no reason to hodl. The state of Bitcoin is dismal with very little in the way of real scalability other then lightning which isn't any kind of real fix. Not to mention the tin hatter's who think using it is somehow sticking it to the bankers on top of the People who want to keep trying to define what Bitcoin is "supposed" to be used for doesn't help the cause. In my opinion, Until it can do as much as easy a credit card or at least be cheaper and easier then wiring money there is 0 chance of it taking over easier cheaper payment options at least In the usa.

True a fact is a fact.

I see it as a short term drop there is no reason that it wont go back up again. people panic and sell then regret it later. It's one of the biggest problems with the coin is panic sellers or people who think that they can time the market. 
I myself will be buying more as soon as i can. Bitcoin will not go away its been proven as a working system along with a lot of the other alt coins. It's as close to an honest system as people can get. if thats not worth supporting i don't know what is. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:49:09
If you wanted to spread the word of bitcoin then why the fuck wouldn't you put a link to somewhere telling people what bitcoin is or what the billboard is about or anything other then a giant yellow sign saying "BITCOIN now give me money"? 
Wasted money on a really good opportunity. 
For people to get involved in something you have to make them want to care and be a part  of it. This gives no reason for either.

I got taken.... Already filed with the BBB and FTC, pay pal and my bank. I highly doubt ill ever see that money but hopefully putting enough shit about the company up will keep anyone else from throwing away cash to these guys. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:04:48
those billboards make me sad.

It can't keep up with demand as it is. Market cap gets to 1T it will take weeks for any transactions to go through. Not to mention the crippling fees.

Man some people hate Bitcoin. I'm no expert but most of these reports come off like sour grapes then anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 21:50:26
I got tired of trying to spread the word of bitcoin by standing at the side of the freeway entrances with a give me bitcoin sign so I decided just to but a billboard up instead. 
I'm not trying to get money by putting signs that say give me money, I'm only trying to raise awareness to bitcoin by the simple statement send me bitcoin. 
If you like the billboard though send me money of which i'm not interested. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:00:51
Ha I already made that mistake. Fool me once. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:58:58
Giving them money was a terrible mistake.

Sure any of the alt coins "Could" replace bitcoin. but why? I haven't seen a single one that does anything better then bitcoin They just change a few of the parameters coins are mined or transaction times but none really have anything more to add to the table. Everyone trys to say this coin or that coin is better but they are all based on the exact same protocol. I think if someone added to the functionality of the protocol wed see a major shift in which coin was used. Something like minor voted charge-backs or an option to have completely identifiable and verifiable addresses and the ability to only allow transactions to those addresses. A more user friendly interface along with an easy way to pull and put fiat into the coin.  
Bitcoin is the most readily available coin out there, like it or not. until I see a dogecoin ATM go up or anyone willing to trade goods buy drugs or the tons of other things you can do with Bitcoin right now ill be skeptical of it.

around 2000 got a 60ghz BFL minor. Took them a year to deliver and got one payout before it became completely useless. So it paid for its self but if I would have just purchased bitcoin instead id have around 4000 btc...
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:28:09
It was only a matter of time. I think the billboard was a good idea but the message is shit. Lets make a national story about me getting more rich by butting up a bunch of billboards.... Fuck that guy/girl. and how the fuck does sending bitcoins to an address make an international story? I do that shit every day I don't see one news van outside my place. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:58:12
Yup I waited a year to get my paperweight. Ended up putting in a BBB claim and an FTC claim before they finally sent it out. I didn't even want the thing at that point just my money back. lesson learned though never will do business with them again.

its easier to create a secure wallet then it is to get a bank account.
