I've been looking for an app, or some kinda of application to monitor + track my balances across wallets + various exchanges because I use some automated trading bots that may trade multiple times per day. Would your app be a good solution for real-time monitoring?

Great work, I've been playing around with it for the past hour. I'll be making suggestions/request in the official subreddit

Popping to "here" is still higher than 6 months before that point. I guess its how you see the bitcoin technology. Sure you may thing my statement is "super long term" but that just means you don't believe it will be around 10-20 years from now. Remember, we are the early adopters, it may be rocky right now, but it will eventually stabilize.

I agree they do, and I do use them. However I am looking to trade some altcoins too.
