Depends how his company was set up. "C" corporations are required to use accrual basis accounting. If that were the case, the date of the sale, not the date the revenue from the sale was realized, would be the sale date for accounting and tax purposes.

Except that I didn't give any advice, and you suck at trolling.

Imagine explaining to your grand children, "I had a whole bitcoin, but I lost it all."

At least when I bought my GPU 2.5 years ago I figured, worst case scenario, I could game on it. Good luck with those ASIC miners, though.

To be fair, anyone who had mined that bitcoin was committing real resources to the network at their own expense and risk, for no reward except that of discovered bitcoins. However, I doubt many bitcoin speculators even believed bitcoin would reach $100 in 2013, especially considering it had never topped ~~$20~~*$30 prior. It does seem like bitcoin is suffering from hyper-intense currency speculation that is driven by those that intend to capitalize on "investing" in bitcoin during a period of economic uncertainty. Really though, it's currency speculation, and although bitcoin has many attractive properties as a currency, it's hardly designed to be an investment vehicle.

I forgot that it rose that high until I just checked the charts, but my point was that early speculators held beyond the market's willingness to pay $30, leading to the correction. I believe in bitcoin as a medium of exchange, and I casually mine, but it's not an "investment" like I think some people may be trading it as now.
