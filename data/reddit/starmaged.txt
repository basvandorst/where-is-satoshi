They very well may have flagged this transaction behind-the-scenes. Just because you see it from you bank doesn't mean that the thief was successful. Coinbase support should be able to get this all settled for ya.

It's entirely possible that someone stole your debit card and used it on a different Coinbase account. Contact support so that they can look into it and advise you on the next steps.

I would argue that Ethereum doesn't use a blockchain. They just pretend to. In reality, they use a centralized database where if the underlying blockchain doesn't agree with said database, a new blockchain is created.
The underlying blockchains were never tampered with or revised.

Almost always this is a result of someone having stolen your debit card and then using it on another Coinbase account.

Another source of confusion that you may have is that, in the course of an IRS audit, if you don't have records of your purchase price, the IRS will assume a basis of zero, forcing you to pay taxes on the entire amount. So, keep good records. However, this only matters if you get audited. If you report bitcoin at all, they will likely pass over you when looking for targets.

Segregated Witness does NOT get rid the transaction signatures. The data is still transmitted and verified by nodes. What it does do, though, is that ANY *valid* signature for the transaction can be used to verify it, not just the specific signature that was used when it was placed in a block. This is important since there have been issues in the past where people could take a signature from a transaction and mutate it in a way that is still valid, but isn't exactly the same as it was. As a real-life example, think of it like you signed a check and somewhere along the way after you passed it along the ink smeared a little bit. The check would still be valid and would still be made out to the same person for the same amount, but it's technically not the exact same signature that was there when you made out the check.
Going back to Bitcoin, now, while this isn't an issue once the transaction is confirmed, this means that you can't base a new transaction off of an unconfirmed transaction because you have no way of knowing for sure what the signature will be when the transaction is mined into a block. The signature is part of the way you point to a previous transaction to say: "I'm spending the bitcoins that I got from here."
All that SegWit does is remove the final signature from that reference. The transaction still needs to be signed and valid, but when it comes to pointing out which previous transaction output you are spending,  it doesn't matter whether the ink got smeared a little bit or that someone else got a copy with a slightly different, but valid, signature in some way.

MAST can be used to decrease the size of Lightning transactions. In fact, if you read between the lines in the OP, that's exactly what it says:


A lot of these new features that are coming out are directly related in some way. Try not to miss that.

Yes. This is why it is critically important that the group of miners remain diverse with no single person or group getting more power than the rest of the miners.
This is called a 51% attack.

A year ago, I would have agreed with you. However, they made a shift in their focus a few months back to work more on their core business of being an exchange.
That being said, they might see enough value in acquiring the user base that they'll buy it anyway.

Lightning Network Bitcoins would just be a withdrawal option, much like PayPal, ACH and Wire Transfers are for the USD side of things.
Last I checked, no exchange has separate listings for BTC / USD and BTC / PayPalUSD.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:35:39
Well, at this point they may as well wait for Lightning Network rather than come up with their own exchange-to-exchange system.
The sad part is that such a trusted channel system as you proposed could have been done a long time ago. If I remember right, this is what services like GreenAddress were trying to do.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:23:36
Yeah, this is a very reasonable concern. I am hardly an expert, but my understanding is that there is no way to restore a channel from a cold backup without providing your counter-party with an opportunity to take advantage of that situation by lying about the most recent channel state.
If you weren't keeping real-time backups, your best hope is to pretend to be offline and force a unilateral close from your counter-party in the channel. If you were at least using third-party watchtower nodes, this is perfectly safe other than the fact that your counter-party could keep you funds locked up indefinitely, albeit at the cost of locking their own funds up. If you *weren't* using a watchtower service, well, your counter-party doesn't know that, so you're probably still fine.
The good news is that this is a fully atomic system, so real-time backups can be directly implemented in wallet software in such a way that it is impossible for the backup to be behind the primary system. These backup systems would only need to handle encrypted blobs of data (using a key that you backed up when you initialized the wallet), so they don't need to be kept all that secure, but this would be separate from the watchtower services.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:05:46
That would be a situation where you would want to use an escrow service (which can be done natively in the channel). "Cheating", in the context of standard Lightning transactions, is defined as publishing an old, obsolete state that the channel was in earlier. You prove this by publishing a key that you only could have gotten if that was not the most recent version of the channel state. This proof is absolute.
@_date: 2018-01-09 21:35:17
It is, indeed, a feature. The idea is that if an entire country gets knocked off of the global internet (this has happened before), it will take a long time for newly minted coins on that minority fork to mature and be usable. This buys us enough time to figure out how to reconnect the nodes in the country to the global Bitcoin network.
No other cryptocurrency has this safety mechanism.

Thanks to the invention of [Channel Factories]( holding larger amounts inside of each channel might be more practical than previously thought.
Your point still mostly stands. I just wanted to point this out in case you or others missed it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:54:50
The escrow service would follow whatever policies and procedures they want to use to make the determination. Every escrow service would be different.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:31:06
Ah, I see your confusion. The transaction with the current channel state has two outputs: 
1) to the other side of the channel that can be spent immediately.
2) to you, but can only be spent after a certain amount of time after the transaction gets into a block OR to the other side of the channel if they have a key that you provided after that version of the channel state became obsolete, which can be spent immediately.
The transaction that has outputs 1 and 2 is valid at any time. Fees are included as normal.
A transaction that consumes output 1 is just a standard transaction, and not that important to this example.
A transaction that consumes output 2 that meets that first condition of just being signed by you is invalid and CANNOT be included in a block without causing that entire block to be invalid until that time lock expires. On the other hand, if a transaction that consumes output 2 meets the second condition of having the key that you provided and is signed by the other side (in which case they will probably send everything to themselves rather than you), that is valid immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:14:27
That's fine, because once it gets into a block you can't spend from that transaction until the time lock expires. The other person who you tried to cheat, however, can spend the entire amount from that transaction immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:35:00
You are correct. Centralized services will always be able to do everything that Bitcoin does, but faster and cheaper. But, this comes at a big cost: they fully control your money. Your money can be kept hostage until you do something, it can be stolen or it can be blocked from being sent to specific people that the central service or the government that oversees that service decides that they don't like for any or no reason.
THAT is what is revolutionary about Bitcoin.

The problem is that those Coinbase people paying in pennies are buying the most profitable products in the store. It'd be hard to convince management to turn them away.
Besides, they are the number one grocery delivery company that delivers from your store. There are better delivery companies that offer to deliver from your store, but the people who use Coinbase Delivery Company don't know about them.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:14:29
And the crazy thing is that Coinbase has enough volume that these "busses" could depart every 5-10 *seconds* so there wouldn't even be an impact to the end users receiving the funds.

Interesting. I knew that n-way channels were possible, but I was concerned about the scaling issues that would have since every participate would need to sign every update. Instead, this treats that n-way channel like the blockchain in that you can commit back to it. This means that if two entities are transacting back and forth a bunch, the other participants don't need to worry about it.
More importantly, this makes Lightning Network warm storage possible and useful: you can store some keys offline and only expose them to the network when you need to make a deposit or withdrawal from your warm storage in the channel to your hot storage within the channel.

The biggest problem with this will be, unfortunately, Bitcoin Cash. If a Bitcoin Cash user deposits into a SegWit address (which they will since they were stupid enough to buy it in the first place), that money can be stolen instead of just lost. It's so annoying that this is a concern that has to be dealt with.

Initially, you asked a very fair and valid question. You were rightly upvoted for that, since other people on all sides felt the same way.
After that, you went and changed that question into a statement of fact and a hit on the moderators. Now it looks to other people as if you must have been highly upvoted because those statements appeared to be accurate and were going to be censored. But that's not why you got upvoted, meaning that you are blatantly manipulating the conversation.
Once someone reported your post and got it deleted for this manipulation, you would have been able to declare yourself a victim of censorship. You probably had a screenshot all ready to go with your initial version of the post, so it even would look like you got the post deleted for simply asking a question!
The best part is that you worded both versions of the post in such a way that the replies still appear to be contextually correct. You would have gotten away with this pretty easily as long as none of the people who originally saw your post looked at it later and remembered what it originally said.
As for why it still gets upvoted, that's because it was upvoted to begin with. Psychologically, people tend to agree and support what it appears everyone else agrees and supports.
If you truly were acting in good faith, that either would have been a labelled addition to the post by keeping the original comment and adding the new comment after an "EDIT: " line, or you would have said that as a reply to one of the people who replied to you.
So, please stop this manipulation. It hurts everyone on every side of the issue.

They will also take that code while it is still being tested in Bitcoin and release a production version for bcash well in advance of it reaching Bitcoin's production release.

Even this line of thinking is too two-dimensional. Businesses have to pay suppliers, they have to pay employees. Such payments can be made per delivery for suppliers and per hour for employees. Theoretically, a business could operate with a single channel that only has the capacity of their most expensive item. That's the way you have to start thinking.

I'm not a CPA or an accountant, but I've worked closely with one for my personal situation.
It's only a grey area if you have no proof that you sent it to yourself AND you get audited by the IRS.
If you are self-reporting every very clear and obvious sale, the IRS will likely just believe you on the other stuff and not bother auditing you. However, since you can be audited for any reason, you should make sure that you never delete any private keys/wallets and keep any other proof you can that you transacted with yourself.

Bull. Shit.
I reported to the IRS for every year covered in this request. I used Bitcoin.tax each time, and it was this easiest thing I've ever done.
The tax years in question also all had due dates *after* the IRS guidelines were released.
If you didn't report your gains and you got caught up in this, I have exactly zero sympathy for you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:16
I used Bitcoin as a cash system pretty extensively. For any purchases where I didn't keep a receipt, I used the daily average price to calculate the sale price. Hell, bitcoin.tax does that for you.
Exchange failures and hacks are a bit harder, but you can reconstruct those records easily enough, especially if you used Bitcoin as a cash system.
Altcoin trades and donations were handled natively in the tool. Those were non-issues.
If you truly don't want to file your taxes without perjuring yourself, then just send in a check for your best guess. You can file the return itself later. This isn't an excuse to not pay up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:59:25
Yup, this is the only reason why I bother responding to certain people. It's also why I'll stop responding to them once the post is no longer very visible. Which is honestly the key takeaway: pick your battles and don't let yourself get sucked in to something that will never be seen by others. There is other misinformation that needs to be corrected that people are looking at right now and that's far more important.

No. There is literally no line where you can even report such a thing to the IRS, even if you wanted to. Also, that part about the 1099-K sounds wrong. I believe that's only if you are operating like a business and it's based on incoming transactions, not outgoing transactions.

You're actually thinking about it from the wrong angle, assuming that you're providing advice to Coinbase over how to price their bounties.
As far as pricing bounties go, the real question to ask is: "How much money could we lose if this isn't reported to us first?" At first glance, those questions appear to be the same. However, you need to consider things like insurance. It's entirely possible that you could steal $100k from Coinbase and it only ever costs them a small fraction of that.
Of course, all of this is ignoring the fact that there is value in being able to be publicly recognized for finding the exploit and not having to deal with the legal issues from hacking someone afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:05:07
The problem is that they are now being convinced that such a small dip is a "crash" and that it can't possibly get any worse. It will get worse. Much worse. People need to know that this thing can drop by 90% or more. Not just 1% or even 30%.

Yeah, it always surprises me how few people realize that Lightning is a game-changer. Although, it really shouldn't surprise me. Looking at it very closely, you realize that Lightning is as big of a technical leap as Bitcoin itself was.
Thus, in the short term, I expect a ton a investment to go towards Bitcoin Cash due to its legacy way of thinking. But, in a few years, people will realize what's up. The cool part about Lightning is that it will largely no longer matter which cryptocurrency you keep your value in, as long as that currency is Lightning-compatible (which Bitcoin Cash is not). So, the currency that you hold your value in will be based more on that currency's security properties. Many people liken Bitcoin to Gold, and I feel that this is an apt comparison for the currency of bitcoin in such a new world. For large sums, you would want to keep it in the denomination of Bitcoin to keep it the most secure. Therefore, the price has amazing long-term potential. Again, the transactional properties of a coin will not matter after Lightning. Only its security properties. It's a totally different way of thinking.
On this point, Litecoin also has strong long-term potential due to its code compatibility with Bitcoin, its strong development team, and the separate battle-tested mining algorithm. It is looking very much like it will be the Silver to Bitcoin's gold.
Anyway, that's my evaluation.
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:49:15


To be fair, they usually do that because other people seem to believe that Satoshi's code is infallible. Over time, that probably became a preemptive response to those people. Finally, it became something that you just say.

Forget about what you bought in for. That's in the past and has no relevance to today.
Pretend all of that money is cash sitting in your bank. Given that and your other current finances, how much are you willing to put into Bitcoin right now?
Once you answer that question, correct your holdings to reflect that. You might even decide to buy more than you currently have if your financial situation outside of Bitcoin has improved since the original purchase and you can handle the risk.
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:38:58
1) Regarding "Interpreting history to support your argument / Bait and Switch". This is, actually, a valid argument to make. However, it has nothing to do with Satoshi the person. Rather, it has to do with what people believed the social contract to be when they started with bitcoin. As a result, things like increasing the number of bitcoin's ever produced will need to overcome this argument. That being said, in the case of blocksize, it's a non-starter as an argument. What ended up defining the social contract was the bitcoin wiki page on scalability, not anything that Satoshi said. Anyone with any reasonable involvement in the project saw that page at some point, so I think that it's fair to claim that as the base of this argument. Obscure quotes that few people saw at the time should be ignored. They have nothing to do with the social contract.
2) Re: splitting apart the blocksize debate and the hard fork debate: that would have been fine if certain people didn't force us to consider these things together by releasing an implementation before the base concept had consensus. The nice part about the Scaling Bitcoin conferences are that they allowed us to start over, considering every piece individually. If you want to see a better quality of discussion, look to those conferences as a starting point.

On the contrary, he went well out of his way to make that *not* be the case. He gave the miners only the power that he couldn't avoid giving them: deciding the order that transactions occurred in. Anything that could be determined independently, was. For example, no amount of deciding can increase the number of bitcoins that will be created. Satoshi could have very easily not had full nodes enforce that, but he made sure that they would.

@_date: 2015-12-20 18:18:14
Yeah, that sounds to me like what happened. As soon as his account went negative, that probably triggered a security alert on his account. Operations locked down the account and passed the relevant info to Dev. The first time, Dev probably received the hacker one report first, which is why OP got paid at all. However, since Dev likely has no Prod access, they didn't know that any actions were taken against the account. As for the second report, the automatic report probably reached Dev first, hence OP not being paid. And of course, the restrictions on the account worsened because Operations thought that this was a blackhat attack.
I've seen this happen to so many companies that it seems like the most likely explanation. I doubt that Coinbase was purposefully being malicious.

As long as they don't have to sue their insurer like *some* company did \*cough\* BitPay \*cough\*, I doubt that we would have ever found out about such an incident. Coinbase would be under no obligation to disclose that it occurred due to it not affecting their ability to repay their customers, so the only person who might discuss it is whoever stole the funds.

That's why the you would have the transaction that spends to the extension chain be an anyone-can-spend transaction. It would only take a soft-fork to then enforce that only spends from the extension chain to the main chain can spend those previous anyone-can-spend transactions.
Whether you *should* do it as a soft-fork is a whole 'nother matter, since you effectively reduce all existing clients to SPV-level security.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:50:20


No, that is not true. If the longest chain includes blocks that create 1000 new bitcoins each, no full node would accept that.


Miners do not vote. They assert what they believe to be the state of the network and other nodes either consider that to be acceptable based on the block history or they don't.
Miners are also not needed to activate new features via a soft fork. The only reason that they are currently used this way is that it makes the process cleaner and more convenient.
Miners are employees of the network, not upper management.

Normally, this would be all well and good like you say. But now that certain miners have decided to do SPV mining, we can no longer ignore blocks like this from a security standpoint. A SPV miner might build on top of this, giving the rest of the network time to finish validating this block as they waste massive amounts of hashpower. Yet another reason to despise SPV mining.

I'll go ahead and answer:


Yes. Miners serve only one purpose: declaring the order in which transactions occurred. Not because of any democratic ideals, but because there isn't any better known way to do that in an untrusted, distributed environment.


That's correct. There is no real need to have a certain level of miner support prior to activating a softfork. It just makes things a bit cleaner and more convenient.

No, I'm not in denial. I used to moderate here. I reviewed each and every entry in the modlog during that time.
Did censorship occur? Were people oppressed? Yes, they were. And I was extremely vocal about it. But, 99% of the people who posted to claiming that they were among the oppressed were either lying about why action was taken against them, faking that they were banned/had a post deleted when we did nothing at all to them, purposefully misquoting us, or taking us out of context. Actual oppression was extremely rare, maybe once every other week. Even then, those were usually not due to malice, just an honest mistake or misunderstanding.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:32:38
This is what I like to refer to as bitcoin's emergency self-destruct mechanism. At a certain point, a chain will have so little hash power compared to the difficulty that long block times become a major usability issue to users. This reduces the value of coins on that chain, which causes fewer miners to mine. That, in turn, creates a death spiral. To make matters worse for the users of that chain, the continued reduction of hash power makes it so that it will take longer for a difficulty adjustment to happen, so the situation doesn't get better. In fact, that difficulty adjustment might not ever happen due to this.
The best part is that we know that this mechanism works. Many alt-coins - even bitcoin's testnet - have had to hard fork to stop it. As a result, few modern alt-coins have this feature anymore, so hardforks (and even just netsplits) are far more dangerous for them.
This is why I advocate for 95% hashpower agreement for hardforks, despite miners not really mattering from an ideological point of view of who matters in a hardfork. Anything less than that may fail to trigger this death spiral.
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:52:12

That is objectively false. If it is possible for 25% of the network's hash power to still be on the original chain, then that chain will almost certainly survive.
You need to set the hash power numbers to be such that the original chain will take months to change difficulty. Even then, you need to hope that nobody is lying about their support for the new chain.

Note: I'm not a lawyer, but I've consulted with one (in the United States) to go over the legality of being paid in bitcoin.
As long as you aren't buying or selling products or services that are illegal to buy or sell you are fine. Report any capital gains on your taxes when you sell (bitcoin.tax is a good site to use to calculate this for you) and don't make a business out of selling bitcoins to people or companies that aren't licensed as money transmitters without having a license yourself. Any exchange that markets itself to Americans likely has this license, so don't worry about that. That being said, trading bitcoins for legal products and services is just fine and doesn't require either party to have a license.
Hope that helps!
@_date: 2015-06-12 00:54:44


Not to derail your point (which is very important as a response to this post), it actually sounds like the poster merely oversimplified what they were told.


This is true, if you do so as a business and you buy or sell from someone who isn't a licensed MSB. This shouldn't be taken as legal advice, but one quick way to tell if you are doing this as a business is if you wouldn't have made the same exchange with a licensed MSB. If you sell to someone and then immediately buy back in, you are almost certainly a business. If you work a job that pays in bitcoin and you occasionally sell to people in person to get cash for your wallet that you will need in the near future (much like you would an ATM), you probably aren't a business.


This is also correct. $1000 is probably a good guideline for guessing if you might be a business, but there is no real dollar amount that matters. If you get paid in bitcoin, you could easily find yourself selling $100k/year to non-MSBs and still not count as a business. On the other hand, you could sell someone $1 in bitcoin for $1.05 and immediately buy back from Coinbase for $1.01 and you would count as a business subject to the regulations.
None of this should come as a surprise.

Yes, you do, in a way. Hence why I said you shouldn't make a business out of selling bitcoin without a license to people that aren't licensed themselves. That is why Know-Your-Customer laws exist.
That being said, as long as you stick to exchanges and trading bitcoin for products and services, you're fine. Whatever happens to the bitcoin after a trade for goods/services or a licensed exchange doesn't matter to you anymore in the eyes of the law. But seriously, don't directly sell bitcoins to people for cash.

Many of the best subreddits are considered to be heavily censored.
@_date: 2015-12-02 02:56:14
The biggest misconception about the moderation in this subreddit is that people aren't allowed to talk about BIP 101. That simply isn't true. Then, people also claim that we ban discussion of XT. That is mostly false as well. The only things you can't do are promote XT the software to users or discuss topics that are specific to XT the software.
To make your analogy more accurate, this is really like another teacher barging into the classroom and telling the students that instead of doing their real teacher's assigned homework assignments, they must do only his assignments if they want to go to college some day. He has no real authority to force people to do that, but the students don't know that and are confused over who to follow. Some vocal students who really want to go to college in the future decide to take this other teacher's word for it and follow him.
The original teacher was stunned by the brazen actions of her colleague, but since he might be onto something, she allows him to justify himself in front of the students. In addition, she also decides to ask the opinion of some experts in the field of education to see if she should just start assigning that same homework to her students directly.
While she was doing this, however, the other teacher decides to start talking over the original teacher while she is teaching as if this was his own classroom. She realizes that she really only has two options for how to proceed: give in and let him take over the class, or force him to move to another room. Given that the educational experts had major concerns over his lesson plans, she decides that the best option is to allow the students to make their own decision rather than doing it for them if she were to step aside. So, she kicks the other teacher out. However, to be fair to the students, she tells him that he can come by every once in awhile to try to argue for his educational ideas.
Although I could extend this analogy further, that's as far as we've gotten. I don't know what is going to happen to those students in the future, but I look forward to finding out.

Ah, yes, that is true. Not that there's much of a practical difference between that and a double-spend, but that is an issue. Regardless, you would need to lock the coins coming back for 100 blocks for other reasons, which is why I was initially confused.
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:43:02
1) Some people (like me) are worried that without an explicit cap you end up creating a new incentive for miners to raise the max block size as high as possible to reduce competition. We believe this to be a valid concern, since mega-corps like Wal-Mart have employed this very tactic in other contexts to eliminate the competition.
So, why not make the cap be decided by using one of the lower values we've voted for? Well, imagine what happens if most miners use that strategy: 90% might what larger blocks, the others might not. However, as block size goes up, those people wanting smaller blocks get eliminated. Then, at the new block size, 90% might want larger blocks, so the block size goes up and more miners get eliminated. Then, at the new block size, 90% might want larger blocks, so the block size goes up and more miners get eliminated. Then, at the new block size... You get the idea. We end up in a death spiral until only a handful of miners can continue to mine.
An explicit cap - *any explicit cap* - avoids this from happening altogether.
2) It simplifies the code that needs to be changed. The network messages would have to be redesigned to support &gt;32MB anyway. Might as well avoid doing that work if we don't have to.

Quite true. If an attacker has almost perfect control over the links between real nodes, they could split the hash power in such as way that the person they are scamming will be on the side that finds 6 blocks, whereas the double-spend gets confirmed on the other side of the split with, say, 8 blocks.
In practice, this isn't as big of a problem as it may appear. Primarily, that is because some of the network links aren't actually random: most of the major miners already have direct connections to each other to help reduce their orphan rate. Secondly, as soon as someone notices this attack (which will be really quick), all people have to do is connect to a single trusted node to protect themselves, as mentioned in an earlier response.
I'm not too worried. Honestly, I'm more afraid of someone cutting the undersea internet cables to force a network split.

Here's my understanding of the timeline:
1) Around May 31st, the researcher found what appeared to them to be an exploit.
2) After one of the wallets got a negative balance, a safety measure prevented all external transfers from the account until that was resolved. This was the first "lock" that was being referred to. The researcher still got paid for it, however.
3) Around October 20th, the researcher found what appeared to be a similar exploit and reported it.
4) Some back-and-forth occurred as Coinbase seeked further clarification.
5) During that process, the account was banned by Compliance for unrelated reasons. This was the second "lock". After that, the researcher was obviously not able to continue working on the problem.
6) Some time later, the researcher created a new account to try to reproduce the exploit again, but it appeared like the exploit got patched in the meantime.
7) More communication to Coinbase, but Coinbase never responded.
8) User posts on Reddit. The rest is history.

Anyone who can afford to become a majority miner in the current algorithm can afford to do so when the algorithm is changed. That is because the existing miner's hardware would also be made useless in the process. If ASICs don't exist for the algorithm we switch to, they could take control of the network by just spending a few thousand dollars on Amazon S3. Even if ASICs do exist, it would take only a fraction of what it cost to take out Bitcoin the first time to take it down again.

He may have been coerced into thinking that he was also breaking the law or at least that he would be perceived as such by the police. Remember, few people, especially 17 year olds, realize their rights under the law. Hence why the vast majority of people talk to the police when questioned, instead of remaining silent. They wrongfully assume that the police officer is the judge, jury, and executioner.

I deleted those comments to *prevent* censorship here, actually. Any politician can tell you this: one of the most effective ways to censor an idea is to shift the conversation to being about the person bringing the idea forward or another idea altogether.
However, this other, more hidden, censorship was a much more pressing matter, which is why I was willing to drop the issue.
As for your confusion over my stances, that stems from the fact that sometimes I am explaining the "official" opinion, which can differ from my own. It would be inappropriate for me to mention my personal opinions in such a context.

This cannot be overstated enough. It must be in bold and italicized. One dollar is the cost of a small coffee at McDonalds, but it can make a world of difference in terms of perception. That entire tipping thread was started by giving out just five dollars, but for the people who saw that thread, I can tell that it did more for their personal perception of bitcoin than every piece of good news we've had all year.

That's the whole idea behind the theory: each miner only needs a single full node. Since that is a fixed cost no matter how much mining hardware you have, it is always to the benefit of most of the remining miners (by hash power) to make that cost as *completely UNtrivial* as possible to kill competition. With an unlimited blocksize, they could actually do that.

Interesting way of point of view, thanks! I think the core of the issue is that people agree that calling someone out as a troll is acceptable when they're legitimately trolling. Due to the circlejerk effect, that gets generalized to calling out anyone who has ever trolled every time they post anything. As a result, the "troll" gets downvoted on legitimate posts and the attack against their character get upvoted.
I wonder if there is a way to prevent that from happening without resorting to a blanket ban on personal attacks, which is something that I am against.

Dear God. Don't speculate until you have a stable financial base to build on. The  pitfall speculators succumb to is trading emotionally, which results in them buying high and selling low. You can't even *start* overcoming that as long as you can't afford to lose everything you put in, yet alone just a few percent.
Just start saving any money you can. Over time, it will build up and you will be able to afford to take risks. Most millionaires didn't get rich by taking huge risks, they got there by being extremely frugal and only taking calculated risks when they could afford to take a total loss.

That doesn't appear to show that Iowa State is blocking it. Rather, it appears that you have been caught by bitcoin.org's DDoS protection. Someone's computer on campus must be part of a botnet that is DDoSing bitcoin.org.
The reason I say that it is unlikely that the campus is blocking it is because unless a firewall is aware of the *exact* number of hops between you and bitcoin.org, there would be no way for it to target only the last hop of the trace since the packets that a tracert sends for each hop only differs by one field: the time-to-live.

As someone who has been around for three years, I can say that you are absolutely correct. Of the people that I never mentioned bitcoin to who now have bitcoins, almost none of them are even aware of this subreddit let alone Bitcointalk. The ones who are programmers mainly read and discuss it on Hacker News, along with all other things dealing with technology. The ones who aren't programmers talk about it around the watercooler (so to speak) much like any other news story.
The bitcoin communities really could disband today without any negative repercussions. The bootstrapping process completed successfully. Good job, everyone! That wasn't sarcasm, this was really awesome to see and be apart of. I can only hope to be apart of something like this again someday.

This is a slight over-simplification. Minors *can* enter into contracts, but they are allowed to void the contract without penalty any time up to their 18th birthday.
In terms of bitcoin exchanges, that means that a minor could buy bitcoins at one price and request a refund *at that same original price at any time* if they so choose, even if the price of bitcoin goes down. Obviously, that's a risk that no exchange would want to take.

This has been proven to be false. One of the biggest scammers in bitcoin, Pirate ran a pool alongside his ponzi scheme. After the ponzi fell apart, his pool still had almost all of its miners for several *weeks*.
The problem with constantly warning people about issues like this is that you very quickly end up with a pool that is made up entirely of people who don't know or care about what they're doing. All they know is that they're being paid. Actually, they may not even know *that*.

Yes, of course it has merit. However, for most people and amounts, the marginal security gain from using a hardcore paper wallet would not be worth the effort.
At this point, I would only advise creating a hardcore paper wallet if you're a terrorist storing over a million dollars in bitcoin. Nothing is stopping you from doing that anyway, so if you want that level of security you can have it. That's what is really nice about bitcoin!

@_date: 2014-05-20 19:05:37
I can see the appeal in using a DHT, since it enables dead-simple zero-trust mirroring of the data. However, I fail to see why Bitcoin is involved.
You'd never want publicly updatable refs, so the refs would only be updated by authorized people. Any attackers would also have the keys necessary to change the refs, which you wouldn't be able to stop at that point, regardless. Therefore, all that we're worried about are natural conflicts where one person updates a ref before they hear that another person updated a ref. That can be solved deterministically, because once again, we have to assume that we're already screwed if an attacker is involved.
In Bitcoin, these conflicts aren't solved with deterministic algorithms because the person who can move coins at one point in time may not be the same as the person who can move them in the future (you wouldn't want someone who used to have the coins be able to re-spend them at any arbitrary time in the future).
So, that leaves us with defining permissions. That's the only place I can see this being useful, since it would allow you to revoke permissions for a key instead of just adding new ones. However, this is mostly a non-issue, since that can also be done by defining a repository owner which can never be revoked.

I'm sorry that you've never been on more than a one-person development team. However, given your tone, I can understand why.
Any developer who has worked professionally knows how misleading your 5-10 minute claim truly is. Sure, they could fix the issue that quickly, but at best it takes over an hour of bureaucratic nonsense to get the patch published. Even that assumes that a developer with the relevant knowledge of the code with the issue was told about the security vulnerability within seconds of it being received. Releasing a fix in thirty minutes is possible, true, but it would require perfect communication all the way through the chain. I don't see that happen very often anywhere.

Yeah, if something is already on the front page of hot, it is usually too late to do anything about. At that point, it has had just enough visibility that we're damned if we do delete it and damned if we don't delete it.
The only time I have deleted a front page post in recent memory was the whole Western Union event, and that was only because it was taking up about 50% of the front page. Even then, about 8 WU threads were unique enough to stay.

If you were to ask an economist, they would say that this is impossible because the exact opposite situation should be going on - a deflationary spiral.
Of course, the real answer is that the value of bitcoin may go up one day, but it might go down the next day. Neither extreme is likely enough to depend upon.

Your bank is required to return your money within 6 months if they close your account, I believe. Most of them will give you the money sooner than that, however.
Your bank knows what you're doing. They will contact you if they need more info. That said, if you are acting as a business, they need to know that.

As someone who is extremely involved in the Blizzard community, Bitcoin sponsoring anything StarCraft is huge. Gamers really don't trust bitcoin yet mainly because the gaming companies don't either. And the gaming companies don't trust it because their fans don't demand it. Mainstream gaming is ultra-conservative these days. If we can get Blizzard to open up to bitcoin through their fans, it will create a domino effect that will not just capture an entire industry, but an entire generation. That's a much more important goal than one minute of TV air time, in my opinion.

I joined the mod team *precisely* because I felt that went too far. I was not involved in that decision nor did I have any knowledge of it until it was publicly announced as a method to "fight spam". I rightly called the mod team out on that bullshit and joined the mod team to fix it. Since then, the karma needed to be auto-censored here has been decreased from 0 to a negative number that I am not allowed to disclose. I am also actively whitelisting not-bad posters from the filter when they are affected by it.
You see, unlike most of the people here, when I saw something bad about an organization that affects Bitcoin, I didn't call them criminals
 - I did something about it.

Automoderator has already been tuned to do a more advanced version of this with very few false positives and false negatives. We try to avoid false positives whenever possible, since restoring those posts don't put them back at the top of /new, meaning they unfairly miss out on most of the exposure a post normally gets.
Regardless, though, none of this solves the problem you are seeing. The truly disruptive trolls are the ones who get up voted. We can't do anything about them automatically and most of the mods are afraid to do anything manually, lest people cry "censorship". Imagine the outcry that would occur if we deleted "thermos is a fraudster" thread 
If you have a solution to that, I'd love to hear it. We love feedback, so I look forward to the community's thoughts on this.

That is a total strawman, because today people are lucky to receive *one* tip, let alone two.
Once someone is setup with a changetip account, tip as low as you want. At that point it's all automatic and they don't have to do anything to claim it, so they will appreciate the gesture. If they have to create an account, however, it's not gonna happen if you don't tip well.
It would literally* cost me more money to create a changetip account than I would make by claiming a few cents. A dollar is at least worth looking into.

I do not believe that it's our standard trolls that are the problem, either. The problem is that is has become popular to bash certain people and topics without having to think about it, so much so that the only people willing to comment on those issues anymore are people that agree with the crowd. We need to change that.
It is a well-known psychological phenomenon that when a large group of people appear to be unanimous on an issue, people will join them in agreement in order to conform with the crowd. After doing that, they will justify that by thinking that they must have personally agreed with that side all along and that they must be right. The people who don't conform then typically won't speak out, since the issue usually doesn't affect them. Things just spiral from there.
As for how we can change that, the answer is simple. If you disagree with the crowd, be vocal about it. The issue being discussed may not personally affect you, but the next one might. If we create a culture of thought, we can have much more depth to our discussions and accomplish so much more. However, if you *agree* with the crowd, seek out posts and comments that rationally disagree and UPVOTE them. NEVER downvote a post because you disagree with someone. Only downvote posts that you would want deleted so that they wouldn't have to be seen by anybody.

Exactly. Doing this would open up a very common design mistake that is one of the worst you can make: centralized attackers earn a HUGE advantage over normal miners. Attackers could trickle out their block until just as soon as someone else publishes a block. There block is guaranteed to win, so why not? Meanwhile, they can mine away on their half-sent block. A 51% attack becomes a 25% attack, at best.

To understand why this is requires you to understand the very nature of how ACH works.
When Coinbase has their bank pull funds from your account, their bank informs your bank that the funds were removed from your account. It doesn't ask if it can or confirm that it's possible, it just explains that it happened. Even if that bank account doesn't exist, Coinbase's bank can only assume that the transaction was successful.
This is where the delay comes into play. For your bank to explain that the transaction was not successful, they must do the same thing in reverse whenever they get around to it. If the transaction was successful, they don't send anything back at all. To make matters worse, these transmissions only happen once per day in a large batch.
To put this to an example, here is the *best case* lifecycle for a transaction that fails that is sent on a Monday before the batch for the day has already been sent:
Monday afternoon: Added to the daily batch and sent by Coinbase's bank.
Tuesday: Transaction is received by your bank. Failure message is sent by your bank.
Wednesday morning: Failure received by Coinbase's bank.
That is 3 business days right there, and that's the absolute best case scenario. If you miss the cut-off time for the daily batch, add an extra day. If a bank is in a bad mood, add a few more days.
Because this system only informs the sender of errors, not successes, Coinbase has to wait as long as the longest possible delay for hearing about errors before they can somewhat safely assume that the transaction wasn't rejected for basic clerical reasons (of course, reversals for things like unauthorized transactions can happen after a much longer period of time, but that's not the purpose of this specific waiting period).
As for bitcoin-to-fiat, it's possible that Coinbase doesn't keep much of a balance in their bank account (a very good idea, because you don't want all of your company's funds tied up if your ACH processor decides that they don't like you any more). As a result, their bank has to wait a couple of days to make sure that Coinbase really did have the account balance that they seemed to have when the transactions were originally requested. This is because any/all of the credits that Coinbase has pulled in during the past few days might not exist.
Companies like PayPal either segregate their sending account from their receiving account, or are trusted enough by their bank to be extended a line of credit should something go terribly wrong.

Karma. Down votes are supposed to only be used to indicate that someone isn't contributing to the conversation and that their post shouldn't have to be seen by anyone. Obviously, that isn't always how it is used, but it works well enough that the moderation team considers it useful. Anyone who drops below a certain karma level will have their new posts and comments automatically deleted until a mod can review it (usually less than an hour). If the content is not bad (pretty low bar), it will be restored. If a mod notices that most of the person's posts are being approved, they will be exempted from the karma filter.
There is no list of who gets their posts auto-deleted, only a list of people who are exempt from the filter. If a person regains their karma, they are returned to good standing without any action on our part.

A store could decide that they would be willing to let people give credit card  and stuff over the phone, making it possible for people to do this with credit cards. However, what this post shows is much more important than the action itself: Bitcoin's permissionless nature, all the way down to the scripting system, means that recipients don't have to do anything special to enable new ways to pay, and senders don't have to do anything special to enable new ways for the recipient to receive.
Want to pay someone using funds that require 2 of 7 signatures to send? No problem, the recipient doesn't know or care. Want to make sure that funds that you receive are locked down to require multiple people to send? No problem.
That's the real point here, and I think that is truly amazing.

Yup, news doesn't effect the price of bitcoin, usually. What typically happens is that there's a price movement and people then attribute it towards the closest positive or negative news story that could reasonably seem to have caused it. For example, the bubble from $1 to $32 then down to $2 in 2011 was commonly thought to have been collapsed by MtGox's first hack. The hack happened several *days* after the pop.

This was your problem. When you are buying and selling bitcoin, banks need to feel that they have enough visibility into your overall finances to know that you aren't likely laundering money. Since they didn't "know their customer", they were forced to close your account.
@_date: 2014-07-04 21:10:05
The Bitcoin Foundation is not incompetent. Rather, their present mission is too broad. However, they (or someone like them) will always be needed to handle the much less "sexy" parts of the project, since nobody would ever be able to successfully crowdfund things like reviewing pull requests (proposed changes to code). Lobbying is also a very dirty business where nobody would fund someone who is actually honest about what they will do.

Martingale is only useful for changing the effective odds that you are playing at. However, since you are able to pick the odds that you play at with dice games, you are far better off just betting a single large high-odds bet, especially since the house takes a cut for each bet.

Unless he can prove that it was a forgone conclusion that the owner of the data on the server was a US citizen, I fail to see how he has a case. Otherwise, when you're dealing with anonymous servers, the investigating agency would be required to get a warrant from every country where the owner may reside, which would be overly burdensome. I highly doubt that a judge would rule that that must be done in cases like this.

It is not a conflict of interest as long as he abstains from any actions that would support this initiative more than it would support bitcoin. The other seven board members can call him out on the conflict if it ends up being a problem. If they fail to do that, we can call out The Bitcoin Foundation once they allow something through that supports Brock's personal projects more than Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2014-05-21 19:51:04
If you want an idea of how far it has escalated, now his bot will copy the title of another post and link to a post or comment on Reddit. I was able to setup filters to deal with that most of the time, but obviously there is only so much that can be done at this point. What sucks about him linking to other posts on Reddit is that we can't even hope that the mods on the other subreddits will do anything about it, since mods can't *ever* delete a post in a way that would hide it when someone directly links to it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 06:00:47
I am quite aware of that. However, normally we are able to permanently override the ban on a per-post and per-comment basis. If he was banned for that comment, then the initial deletion would appear in the mod log as being made by an admin.
@_date: 2014-06-28 22:46:45


Exactly! I think you're starting to understand what I'm saying.
If these posts are clumped together on the same page of /new, delete all but one if they are *almost exactly* the same. If one hits the front page, then delete regardless of clumpage.
I don't know about you, but I deleted *plenty* of GHash posts. Only posts that were somewhat unique and not represented on the front page made it through while I was online. That was still quite a few posts, but that's just fine.
I haven't had time today to look into *this* situation, but it was quite manageable around when you got online and didn't yet require any intervention. However, if people are messaging you to tell you that the posts are out of control, that's generally a good sign that you should intervene.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:03:11

Uhh... Mark no longer controls the wiki. That's a huge misconception that even the other mods had today. It is presently officially owned by either Bitcointalk or Theymos (I don't know which, but it's the same, anyway). In fact, the payment system for registering as an editor is being ripped out and replaced with the awesome new system from Slickage that Bitcointalk financed.
Many changes were made today to prevent future problems, with more in the pipeline. Stay tuned!

Yes, they would, but only if they didn't do anything about it. From my experience, only the congressman themself usually gets the wrath. At any rate, I don't think that is a very good comparison to this issue.

Bitcoin Core is built deterministically and verified by multiple people before the binary is made available to download as the newest release.

We are very quick to override shadowbans because the reason for most of those bans are completely absurd. For example, a person can lose their privilege to speak here by abusing their voting privileges. That has nothing to do with the quality of their comments, so we restore the person's speaking privileges via automoderator. If we end up manually approving a shadowbanned user's posts often enough to notice, we add them to the whitelist to avoid wasting further moderator time. It's that simple.
Our bias is to whitelist people, so please report posts where this charity is abused. We will still see those reports. Also report users to us via mod mail if they regularly abuse this. They will be reviewed for a ban just like anyone else would be.
If you want someone banned in you must go through us. We will take the admin's judgment into account, but you cannot just go above us and expect the ban to stick.

So, this is what probably happened: In October 2011, hacker  re-created the account.

Absolutely. So many people blindly downvote every comment from people that they deem to be "troll". As a result, those people who may have just had a few trollish comments but were otherwise well-reasoned with their other posts were pushed out of the community, causing the community to become more extreme in their views. This continued in a downward spiral of insanity to the point where even the bitcoin developers were downvoted to hell.
We're starting to recover from this, but it will be a long journey. If you (the community) want to help this along, please upvote minority opinions and comment when you disagree with what appears to be the majority. If you don't do that, you're part of the problem.

Gavin, you're getting emotional again like you were with Luke during the whole BIP 16 debacle. In case you've forgotten, I'd like to remind you of one of the core guiding principles of the bitcoin community: Ideas, regardless of who they come from and are defended by, should be judged on their own merits. Put simply, you shouldn't even *care* who says something. If a topic keeps coming up in a way that has already been refuted, feel free to ignore the conversation and just link back to those criticisms until they are addressed. But as bitcoiners, we are above these petty squabbles.
As a moderator, that is something that I constantly have to remind myself every day. However, I feel that it is truly needed if this technology is to stand any chance in this world.

Ah, you're going *that* route. In that case, I would try to deposit funds using any method other than cash, such as a check. If you are able to determine that it was really a cash payment, then I will admit that you are safe from fraud. However, if the bank ever found out what you are doing, your account would be closed fairly quickly. Companies have been trying to do what you are doing for several years.

Here's what I think may have happened: It's very likely that a bunch of people reported the post and AutoModerator trashed it. Very few subreddit mods will actually review the actions of AutoModerator and there is usually too much spam in modmail to notice any appeal.
The mods there are probably understaffed and overworked.

We are keenly aware of this, but its a tough balance.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:04:14
Agreed. They should consolidate their funds into known bitcoin addresses so that we can easily track this. It would be neat if they could then tag every spend to explain the purpose of the transaction. This could be rounded out with quarterly summaries of the expenses so that the lazier people can get a higher level view of what the money is being used for.
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:00:38


BashCo, thanks for bring this to my attention. What you just described is one of the very definitions of trolling. Normal people, after being shut down a few times, stop arguing for a point. Only someone trolling for attention would continue.
I have given him a temp ban in hopes that he will correct this behavior.

@_date: 2014-12-13 20:35:33
Absolutely. However, more important than that, if you *do* have critical thinking skills, don't let the consensus silent you. If you disagree with the crowd, we need you to still voice your mind. If you don't, you're part of the problem.
Most of the Bitcoin Core team is afraid to comment any more for this very reason. We cannot allow this to continue.
@_date: 2014-06-19 05:04:27
Yes, but since I started getting paid in bitcoin, it stopped bothering me. Sell off what you need for today and the next six months at the very minimum. Even *that* is almost too much exposure to Bitcoin.

I hate to say this, but this is actually good news. In order to sell the bitcoins, they would have had to:
1) Make a bitcoin transfer.
2) (most likely) Setup an account at an exchange.
Both of these are very useful for creating trust in bitcoin, and emphasize why it is so critical that we tip people well to increase awareness for bitcoin. I would be much more worried if people simply held on to the coins.

The reason why no exchange will take you as a customer is because minors have the right to void any contract that they enter into (with a few exceptions). That matters because a minor could purchase bitcoins at a high price and then indefinitely maintain the right to return those bitcoins at that same price even if the price of bitcoin drops. No exchange would be willing to take that kind of risk.
@_date: 2014-11-15 08:36:37
Due to NDAs, I can't be specific, but I personally know a well-regarded software consulting company that bills that amount for each senior-level developer. Since this company isn't located on either of the coasts, this is most likely a bargain.
That amount is not for a salary. It is not supplemented with a benefits package. You also have to consider administrative overhead as well as some extra profits to deal with the large non-billable gaps that you will inevitably have between contracts.

The Bitcoin Foundation is not incompetent. Rather, their present mission is too broad. However, they (or someone like them) will always be needed to handle the much less "sexy" parts of the project, since nobody would ever be able to successfully crowdfund things like reviewing pull requests (proposed changes to code). Lobbying is also a very dirty business where nobody would fund someone who is actually honest about what they will do.

The positive feedback is directly related to the value of the tip. You usually see negative feedback when people are tipping pennies *or less*. The moral here is that if you're going to tip outside of the cryptocurrency subreddits, tip well.

True, but most professors don't think that way. Hence, Satoshi was probably more along the lines of your everyday programmer that just put a few good ideas together. Basically, I agree with the rest of your post.
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:31:52
This is really just Bitcoin going back to its roots. Prior to early 2011, tipping was extremely common. In fact, like early Dogecoin, it was really the only use for bitcoins. This is the main reason why so many people on Bitcointalk.org had their bitcoin address in their signature.
Dogecoin may have reminded us of the marketing power of tipping, but the tipping culture has always been part of the movement.

You must be in the wrong sub, because this is a post about stating a no trolling rule in where trolling is purposefully not defined for the reasons I stated.
Psychologically, it's far easier to convince someone to do the wrong thing when their own written definitions contradict what they believe.

It was a BS excuse for the banning, since the mod that did that banning isn't used to having to explain himself. Ad hominems are the things that can get you banned, but only in specific cases.

The use of Slickage specifically was never discussed publicly, but it was always implied in the new forum bounty thread that the entire stash of bitcoins were first and foremost to be used for getting new forum software. It just so happens that it took so long for theymos to find someone good to work with that those bitcoins grew to be worth several million dollars.
Think of it like a Kickstarter campaign that blew right past its goal by a couple of orders of magnitude. Would you be okay if they just pocketed the difference, or would you DEMAND that they expand their original scope to take advantage of those extra funds?

No, I am not misunderstanding at all. Having a private key written down is all well and good, but without the software to determine what the Bitcoin address corresponding to it is, you can't ever send money to it. If I recall, said software simply didn't publicly exist until 2011.
It's possible that he compiled a one-off bitcoind that injected a hard coded private key into his wallet, but I would suspect that he did not, since the *idea* of a paper wallet didn't exist yet either (although I may be mistaken about that).

It's not like bitcoin builds upon or was dependent on ECC technology, so I fail to see the relevance.

There's a very good reason why you have to be 18+ to buy bitcoin: As a minor, you permanently hold the legal right to undo any purchase you make for the original dollar amount you spent. That means that if the price of bitcoin goes down, you can return your original purchase and avoid losing money. No exchange wants that kind of liability.

@_date: 2014-06-16 20:54:07
Counterpoint: the most qualified applicants aren't ever *actively* seeking employment, so they will never apply  through regular channels, regardless. Instead, the company seeks them out directly. Therefore, applications through the normal process should *only* be about searching for diamonds in the rough.
@_date: 2014-05-21 23:41:49
Not really... If they are even remotely competent in their investigations, they can screen out the vast majority of people trying to exploit their process. I know this first hand, since I used to do this job at Bitcointalk.org back before there were reasonable subsitute sites for trading (we stopped doing it because it was an extreme amount of work and these other sites popped up).
Not to mention, it's not like that information would be very useful to someone malicious. There are far more easier ways to get someone's current IP address (just not previous IP addresses if you didn't seek that out ahead of time), and you can easily guess what someone's activity is by checking social media.

Early 2011, $1. If you wanted to see how Bitcoin worked (which was necessary at the time since you were only investing in Bitcoin's future), your only options were the original whitepaper and [theymos' blockexplorer]( The [first bitcoin explanation video]( didn't exist yet. Wanted to buy bitcoins? Well, you could buy a few (not much in $$) from a guy who sold them for PayPal, you could buy a few hundred by mailing cash to some shady guy in Canada, or you could buy a few thousand by wiring money to some *even shadier* guy in Japan (I came into bitcoin after Jed sold MtGox). Unless you mined bitcoins early on, acquiring them en masse was almost impossible unless you accepted and embraced the possibility that the guy you sent money to could and would steal all of it. Anyone who got rich from that time period was merely lucky.
That being said, while I'm not ultra-rich, I don't actually have to work a normal job for the foreseeable future. It's pretty neat! I get to hang out here with you guys simply because I want to, not because I have to.

There is actually a cell phone network in NK, but it's theoretically only for government and tourist use.
And while I'm at it, I might as well answer the other question this response brought up: North Korea has tourists. As long as you aren't American, you can book a tour there fairly easily through Chinese travel agencies. If you *are* American, you'll have to pay them extra and provide them with some lead time to set you up with fake documents. Either way, you must stay with the tour group at all time.

The biggest mistake you're making here is that you are assuming that news causes the price to move a certain amount in a certain direction, depending on the type of news. It does not. The price goes up because the price is going up. The price goes down because the price is going down. All that news does is trigger the event to happen, but the event itself was already predetermined by the current sentiment.

Because, sometimes, you realize that none of the existing solutions are good enough for your needs and you also happen to have a large stash of money lying around. When Google was working on improving Gmail, this was the exact problem they faced, but with web browsers. You see, none of them were fast enough or otherwise provided the experience that Google was hoping for, even if users installed browser extensions. [1] So, they built their own browser: Google Chrome. It is now the most used web browser in the world. [2]
If you feel that a comparison isn't enough, the same thing actually happened to forums back in the late nineties. vBulletin, one of the most well known forums used today, was made as a rewrite of a forum written in VB that they wanted to have written in PHP. [3] It was a massive success.
THAT, my friend, is why we need a million dollar internet forum.

Agreed. The "sexy" new features that you can point to should really be handled by crowdfunding mechanisms like lighthouse. I really hope that starts happening in the future. The problem is, *because* The Bitcoin Foundation shouldn't be funding these awesome features that don't require a foundation to happen, it is hard to point out what exactly it is that they do. Of course, that problem of ambiguity is the same reason why something like Lighthouse cannot easily completely replace the role of foundations. Important developers like Gavin shouldn't be personally spending a bunch of their time raising awareness for their money paycheck campaign and worrying about whether or not their paycheck will be the same for that month as it was the month before. With foundations, you just apply for the job once. The foundation then takes care of everything else.

Reddit will shadowban anybody who (appears to) vote from multiple accounts. Instead of just revoking the person's voting ability, Reddit also prevents them from speaking. We do not believe that is right.
@_date: 2014-06-26 09:56:10
I can't move votes or comments to a different post, so removing the first submission of something would be disingenuous to those who already voted and commented. Besides, you're not *technically* supposed to submit your own stuff to Reddit, so we can't make special exceptions to allow the content creator's post to take precedence.

No. The "whole fucking point" is having a system that is decentralized AND usable (in addition to other qualities, possibly). Otherwise, you end up with this nice decentralized system that most people would not be able to use in real life.

Ugh... There's nothing wrong with removing repeated self-posts. Just make sure that, like when you remove duplicate articles, the self post doesn't bring up new points or raise new questions. If someone is just like "check out this weird PM I got" and that same PM has been posted, it's a dupe. Delete it.
An experienced mod can go a step further and generalize this to deleting posts based on the expected comments, but that sense doesn't form until you've missed for a couple of years.

Not saying it is right, but the US technically has jurisdiction over any website that can be used by Americans. That said, the FBI, et al. often coordinate investigations with foreign law enforcement for cases outside of the US whenever the case affects Americans and the other country needs a push in the right direction.

People are lazy and need summaries. A "What we accomplished in the past 3 months" post that you can submit to Reddit would go a long way to dispelling a large amount of hatred towards the foundation. Put simply, the foundation is too humble for its own good.

Ah, I see what you're doing there now. The definition of what is and is not on topic directly relates to how much it distracts from the topic at hand. As you can see, this thread of conversation directly tied back to the concept of censorship in this subreddit, and is therefore on topic.
@_date: 2014-04-21 07:35:43


Hilariously enough, this whole issue started because people wouldn't let a real conversation happen.
In all seriousness, we maybe *should* start requiring that people with poor reputations use throwaway accounts when posting serious ideas.
Maybe *everyone* should have to be anonymous. Have AutoModerator delete anything made by an account older than one day. It would certainly fit the Bitcoin philosophy. What do people think?

Spammers would start personal subreddits and post their comments there with a link to a post here so that totes would pick it up and post for them. They knew that we wouldn't simply ban totes, so they did this in hopes of forcing our hand to either allow them to post their spam here directly (they even told us as much) or ban totes. I call them spammers instead of trolls  because this happened at a rate of 10s of posts per minute.
I was fine with most of the links.

I meant that you couldn't figure out the Bitcoin address for an *arbitrary* private key without putting some hacks into the bitcoin client's code. Sure, satoshi was certainly capable of that, but if he did it often he certainly would have automated it. Hell, Tor support existed fron the beginning just because he personally used it, so this would have too if he had used it often.

@_date: 2014-11-15 08:10:12
While I agree with that sentiment, I must also admit that any such discussion would have just been discussion for discussion's sake, only delaying things further. First off, as theymos mentioned, he would have to ignore most of the responses:


If you didn't donate, you have no moral grounds from which to speak to for how the funds should be spent.
Once the donors reviewed the various commentary, they would have decided whether or not to move forward with Slickage. If they thought spending that kind of money would be extremely inefficient, they would have found themselves in a situation where they have to wait even longer for the goal to be met, or they would have had to come up with some other way the funds could be spent to benefit the forum (as that was the original intent of the funds). Given this, it was unlikely that a consensus would have been reached, thereby forcing the default case of waiting even longer.
At least this way, something is happening. True, we may never know how the donors would have acted if they were allowed to weigh in, but I don't believe that is that bad of loss.

I barely understand it myself, and I was there. Basically, he announced that he would be hosting a Bitcoin conference in Pattaya, Thailand, which is known for male prostitution. It came out via some posts on a non-bitcoin-related site that he mentioned enjoying the "boys" when he went there in the past. Bruce explained that "boys" is just the local term that they use there to mean male prostitute, but everyone ignored him and claimed that he was really having sex with children. Just like most of the members of the Bitcoin Foundation are now, he was scared away from the community. Supposedly he's still around in the background, but I haven't heard that for some time now, so who knows.

Sorry, but even offensive comments must stay. Offensive comments do not violate either Reddit policy or this subreddit's policy, as they currently stand.
This issue came about because I was mistakenly under the impression that off-topic *comments* (not just posts) were against policy. Your confusion likely stems from the fact that offensive comments are typically off-topic. That was literally the only criteria I was using.
@_date: 2014-06-28 08:17:40
They weren't very specific with us. My understanding is that they suspect that the email is false and that all of this is libel.

If a cashier somewhere were mean to you, would you complain about that specific person on the internet, or would you go to their manager? Actually, I forgot that this was Reddit, so don't answer that. The point is to prevent a witch hunt and to allow us to try to resolve the problem in good faith. The public would take care of discovering *what* actions are bad, and theymos would take care of the *who*.

This patch would allow something where miners could agree to audits (in the same way that pools audit their miners - by submitting shares) and possibly leave a deposit with BitPay and pals that says that you won't accept any double-spend for a transaction that they send you, allowing them to better gage the odds of a doublespend for a transaction. In exchange, they pay you higher fees. Nothing about this would have issues scaling to many or even most miners.

@_date: 2014-12-21 06:45:09


Some context here for those who don't know: It is our general policy not to interfere with highly commented posts because of how much grief we will get for doing so, even if the post blatantly goes against policy. This is also why most people think that we don't do anything. When we take action against a post, it usually only has a handful of comments. Therefore, you probably didn't even know that the post happened. However, if for some reason all of us are asleep, trolls get free-reign on the front page and there's nothing we can do at that point. We're working on being a little more strict on front page posts, but as you can imagine we're taking this very slowing and gauging the community's reaction. For example, a few weeks ago I deleted about half of the Western Union posts on the front page (leaving 8 of them up) and the community responded well to that action. Hopefully, this restriction will become less of a problem in the future.

I could put my real address on an order, but tell the site that my email address is BILL_FUCKING_GATES (yes, I'm being purposefully stupid here) and it will happily mail me my order to the address I gave them while also delivering an email confirmation of my order to the random email address I gave them.

This seems to be a really common complaint. If anyone from The Bitcoin Foundation is reading this, I highly recommend publishing quarterly reports to the community that show off TBF's contributions to Bitcoin. This is so important to do that I can hardly think of any successful public-facing non-profit that doesn't at least do something like this on an annual basis. If people could easily see what has been accomplished, they might start appreciating the foundation more.

Not really. If you take 600 ms as an absolute minimum propagation time (that's just under the amount of time it takes for light to go half way around the world), that translates to a 1% orphan rate for 1 minute blocks. Indeed, that is acceptable, since we do worse than that as it is. However, that is the physical limit. Even with all physically possible optimizations, the orphan rate with 1 minute blocks is merely "acceptable". Let that sink in for a minute.
As for people using central pools, I'm referring to a future where only ONE pool, in total, would be used as a result of the otherwise high orphan rate.

That is a much harder angle to justify. Instead of weighing the pros against the cons (like we are with the block size debate), you would have to show that decreasing the time between blocks is extremely safe.


You can't optimize the speed of light, unfortunately, barring huge scientific breakthroughs that would change the laws of physics.
By decreasing the time between blocks, you increase the orphan rate. Because central mining pools don't suffer from orphans, you increase the pressure to centralize.

On the contrary, by OKCoin's own admission there are regulatory risks to sending money to Roger Ver. Even if such risks are not real, attempting to knowingly avoid them constitutes money laundering.
Given that OKCoin is an exchange that is required to actively seek out people who do this on their own system, this is beyond a minor issue. This means that they haven't likely followed financial regulations elsewhere.
This admission alone is enough to have all of their funds seized, regardless of the later findings of investigators.
If you have funds there, get out now.

Bleh, I was off by a factor of 10 in my math.
So, a perfectly decentralized network with optimal software and networks would have an orphan rate of slightly more than .1% with 1 minute blocks. That gives us a little more breathing room. I think it's enough to say that it will one day be safe to have 1 minute blocks.
Going back to the topic of centralization, a 1% orphan rate is just fine. I even said as much. However, that is only 10x the losses due to physical limits. It's doable, but that's asking a lot from technology.

Basically, you add an additional restriction to the block validation rules (something that only requires a soft fork) that all new blocks must also validate a side chain. This allows you to treat the two chains as one, effectively increasing the maximum block size. Thanks to P2SH, it is possible for old clients to send bitcoins to the extended chain without even knowing that they are. As for going the other way, the block validation rules would enforce that.
Anything involving an old client would forever be limited to 1MB, but transactions between new clients would have the new limit.
All of that is just the way I came up with a couple of years ago. I'm sure that the solutions have improved since then.
That being said, it's an ugly hack. It makes things significantly more complicated, which as Gavin brought up in a previous post, is a thing to be avoided.
@_date: 2015-05-22 05:58:06

On the contrary, we live those effects every single day. As for going as high as proposed, Gavin and others have already researched the impact.
What isn't well understood (or rather, wasn't [until]( [very]( [recently]( is what happens when we *do* hit a limit. For effectively bitcoin's entire existence, the 1MB block size limit hasn't even come into play, much like the US debt ceiling. Unlike the US debt ceiling, however, we can't wait until we hit the block size limit to decide what to do. Due to the nature of the change that is needed we need at least a 1 year lead-time to get the updated client out there. We can work on preventing the need for this in the future, but now is not that time. We must act.

Matthew, I actually agree with you. Take a look back at all of the new Bitcoin businesses and you will almost always see the same pattern: the first business failed, but later ones succeeded. MtGox and TradeHill both died, but CampBX is still limping along, despite coming about in 2011. Coinbase followed all of them PLUS BitInstant as competitors, and is extremely successful. Blockchain, Inc. came about well after theymos' BlockExplorer, but through constant dedication quickly made BlockExplorer irrelevant and then branched out in other ways, too. Hell, Litecoin wasn't even the first Scrypt-based chain, and look where it is now.
High thought and dedication to an idea really and truly is more important than being "first".

It changes the incentives. With a hard limit, miners have no incentive to spam max-size blocks. With a dynamicly adjusted limit, however, you create an incentive for large miners to spam transactions into blocks to increase the limit and drive out competitors.
We don't know if that's what will actually happen, but many people feel that the risk is too great. From that perspective, we're better off with unlimited size blocks.

It seems that you may fundamentally be misunderstanding how the Bitcoin network works. In the Bitcoin network, every node independently verifies each and every transaction. They can do this because the blockchain establishes the ordering of the transactions, which is a process that goes well beyond the scope of this reply. At any rate, this grants an interesting property to the network: no matter how many nodes lie to you, as long as just a single node is telling the truth, you will remain synchronized with the network. As a result, you only need to have enough connections to reduce your vulnerability to a Sybil Attack to minimal levels. The core developers currently believe that 8 outgoing connections is enough to avoid this. Since every node is equally vulnerable to this, there is no reason why Coinbase needs to have more connections to the network than a single person.

@_date: 2015-05-04 20:00:43
It's possible to do it as a pseudo-softfork, but it's *really* ugly. Put simply, you enforce the rules of a side-chain at the network level. At that point, a new client sending to a new client could have their transaction recorded in the larger blocks, but transactions involving old clients would remain on the 1MB chain.
Doing that is extremely complicated and should be avoided if possible.

Not only is it technically possible, it only requires a soft fork, not a hard fork. However, for that very reason, people are rightly concerned that using a soft-fork to block *any* transactions is a slippery slope that sets the stage for blocking other people's transactions. It would also open the door to governments having the authority to block transactions, since we would have proven that it is possible.

The earlier removals were not in accordance with policies. There was some confusion among the moderators about whether a statement made in the post would require it to be deleted.

This is exactly how all of these exchanges came into being. Every time every exchange refused to allow trading for a new coin, a new exchange popped up about 2 weeks later from a member of that coin's community.

My statement is more in regards to how poorly designed the Reddit interface is for giving bitcoin tips, not about tip buttons in general. If you want people to be able to tip you for a post you made on Reddit, Reddit gives you only two ways of giving your bitcoin address:
1) Actively posting it in each post (this is primarily what I was referring to).
2) Assigning yourself flair that has it, making it a passive action. This would be great except for the fact that it would prevent us from assigning other flair (like the 'expert' tag), moderators could edit it at any time without notification (so changes by a corrupt mod could go unnoticed indefinitely), and it would only appear in Hopefully this helps you understand our side a little better.

The reason it seems odd is because you are only considering one side of the equation.
Consider a person who always, without fail, submits a transaction exactly 5 minutes after the last block was found. You would think that in order for the 10 minute block time average to work out, that must mean that it would only take 5 minutes on average to find the block after that point. Unfortunately, this fails to consider that a block can be found in substantially less time than 5 minutes. Because those blocks don't last 5 minutes, our hypothetical person wouldn't submit a transaction during those blocks. However, those blocks still have an effect on the average block time. Therefore, the average amount of time that the person has to wait for their transaction to get into a block is still 10 minutes.
Alternatively, consider the classic example of a six-sided die. You roll the die until you fail to get the number '6' three times in a row. What are the odds that the next roll will be a '6'? 1/2 or 1/6th? The correct answer is 1/6th. The die doesn't 'remember' how long you've been throwing it.
@_date: 2015-05-12 00:04:42
I recently paid for a car with a personal check. For some odd reason, they didn't detain me or the car for a week - which is how long it takes just to find out if the account has the money, not even whether or not the check will ever bounce.
I understand where you're coming from, but if we're going to reduce network security by increasing the block rate, there needs to be a compelling use case that it would enable that would otherwise not be possible.
One good example that I've seen is adding pre-paid time to your cell phone. Since those transactions cannot generally be undone, it is likely that prepaid reload sellers would wait for some number of confirmations before contacting your carrier to add the funds to your account. At the same time, you probably want to use your phone right away.
Unfortunately, that is also a case that is mostly an artifact of our current system. Prepaid phone usage is a perfect candidate for payment channels.
So, to recap, we're looking for cases where you:
1) Would be willing to wait a few minutes.
2) Would not be willing to wait over 1 hour.
3) Aren't (usually) able to plan in advance that you need this thing.
4) Are purchasing something that can't reasonably be provided with zero confirmation. By reasonably, I mean something that a competitor couldn't undercut a company on just by waiting for confirmations.

We need to know the *exact* wording directly from FinCEN.

Exactly. What people often forget is that the current voting system works extremely well ~95% of the time.

I can tell you from my personal experience as a former moderator of that such actions were extremely rare. You may get the impression from reading the other subreddits that you were only hearing about a small fraction of the times when this happened, but in reality you were hearing about almost all of them PLUS a bunch of the times where the post was obviously trolling (a post made just to rile people up).
Did some censorship occur? Yes. But the mods dealt with the issue behind the scenes to prevent it from happening again. Mods are human, and shit happens.
To help you challenge your impressions, let me ask you this: do you believe that Coinbase bans most of their users? Do you think that most of the complaints that you've heard were really from (legally, under US law) innocent people?
If you thought both of those were true, I probably won't be able to convince you on the censorship issue. But, if you knew those statements were false when I said them, I ask that you look at what you've heard about moderation in the same light.

Exactly. This is not the first time where it has been possible for the sender to make some simple transformations on their side to make it so that the receiver would have to upgrade to see the transaction. A great example was when we started using compressed public keys in transactions. Turns out, people won't send bitcoins to a completely different bitcoin address and assume that it will somehow work. Shocking!

I think that the point is that it's a little hypocritical to say that Core should have stood up against the censorship when you, yourself, did nothing to denounce the extremists on your side.

Exactly. There are a large number of people out there who want bitcoin to enter another bubble, and they feel that an instantaneous increase of the capacity of the network is the best way to do it. That is why you hear them being against SegWit. Due to the nature of SegWit, that capacity increase would be more gradual as wallets upgrade, not instantaneous. It would be harder for another bubble to form in that environment.

That would completely defeat the purpose. If you are immediately re-buying your bitcoins when you use the card, it might as well be a normal debit card attached to your bank account.

Honestly, I feel that this is one of the biggest problems that I have with the moderation in this subreddit. Back when I was mainly in charge of Automoderator, I noticed that every time I improved the automation, the other mods got less and less active. For good reason, though: they had less to do. They would log in, go through the queue, and log out. I get it. However, it meant that response times went through the roof. That's a huge problem when you are heavily dependent on simplistic automation.
Volunteer moderation doesn't work well in such an environment unless you have absolutely tons of moderators. But that would be a problem, too, since the more moderators you have, the more you have to strictly define the rules. That just turns them into human robots.
The whole thing sucks. I blame Reddit.

@_date: 2016-01-27 19:07:29
In reality, it isn't. What's actually happening here is that Coinbase is fronting you the money in hopes that they will later be able to collect it. If you go to your bank immediately after you buy the bitcoin, you will still be able to withdraw those funds from your bank account. The idea behind requiring you to add your credit card to receive instant purchases is that they have an alternative method to collect those funds from you if the bank transfer fails.
Unfortunately, the method that Coinbase is using to charge the backup credit card only works if they are selling you a product, not cash. For them to do that, they would need to classify the charge as a cash advance, which they want to avoid because that usually incurs additional interest and fees to the customer from the credit card company.

So, now we have to ask: who would be powerful enough to make that happen and didn't want Bitcoin to take Hearn's path? Possibly Satoshi Nakamoto. Or at the very least, whoever it was that sent that email pretending to be him last year about the dangers of populist rhetoric. But who knows.

The problem is that they don't, which is a major reason why debates over the scaling issue are so difficult. Until yesterday, even Brian Armstrong, CEO of one of the biggest bitcoin exchanges, *legitimately believed* that miners had full control of bitcoin. From there, he came to the conclusion that the miners were in some way giving up this control to the development team.
Although his wish to have the miners reclaim their power seemed noble, it turns out that he was really advocating for a hostile attack by the miners without even realizing it.

The current process used by Bitcoin Core is completely public from a code standpoint and involves several months of testing and review, which offers you plenty of time to make your own decisions about the code they are changing. Miners, on the other hand, are capable of being completely private and offer no opportunities to provide external review other than what the protocol requires. Since no amount of dictatorship can truly centralize the development process, while the same is not true of miners, the higher priority should be in keeping the miners decentralized. Or at least capable of being decentralized.

No kidding. I know that a lot of people rag on Blockstream, but we as a community need to ask ourselves: how did we let this happen? How is it that so many core developers were on the market at the same time? And before you say that they would have centralized on one company anyway, remember that these developers aren't stupid. If they actually had multiple competitive offers on the table, I believe that they would have done the right thing and joined separate companies. So why did nobody give them that option?

Actually, it has, but I don't blame you for not hearing about that through all cries of persecution by Blockstream that people had, along with other rhetoric.
While everyone here was bickering, the Bitcoin Core developers kept working hard on the sidelines, largely ignoring us. They worked out their technical disagreements and now they are almost ready to release the product of their hard work.
The system works.

No, they strongly believe that overall capacity should increase without having to depend on centralized solutions. Very few people believe that this can only happen if a hard fork occurs. Or at least they would if they actually knew the whole story.
Unfortunately, many people have been convinced that anyone who doesn't support, specifically, a block size increase, is lying, attempting to take over bitcoin, being paid, etc.

No kidding. I keep thinking about how their technical decisions would have been handled if they were found to be the best option for Core. As soon as it would have been decided to do a hard fork, they would have opened a window of time to accept additional hardforking changes from the hardfork wishlist. If Classic wants to genuinely improve bitcoin, they should try to be Core, but where the bar for doing a hard fork is slightly lower.

Do they, though? Every day, I continue to be surprised over what people just assumed to be true and never really questioned. What makes this line of thought so special that it's immune to that effect?


Great! Now the discussion is actually getting somewhere!
Let me ask you, looking at the two versions of the question you/Armstrong raised, which one is more likely to be taken seriously by the other side?
With this new version of the question, I feel that I could provide an answer that would, in fact, be relevant to this debate. Like you said, the original question and answer is part of "a pointless and semantic debate". I agree, so let's not waste time with it. But for that to happen, we need people to stop bringing it up. Hence this post.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:04:57
Yup. People keep saying that the fact that we are even having this debate means that bitcoin has failed. That's absurd. It's quite the opposite, actually. This is what the system looks like when the system works.
I continue to be impressed every day about how well bitcoin was designed.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:35:10


Ah, I see how this works now.
Why are we even having this argument? It's all semantics. What users and miners call it is besides the point. Trying to assign a different definition to a highly specific technical term is as pointless as asking whether the polinating bee or the flowering plant produces the honey. They both depend on each other to make the delicious treat.
I'm certain all the parties arguing over this understand this, so I'm not sure what the point of it all is.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:04:51
The thing to point out is that both of those say "grow". For some reason, many people don't realize that.
@_date: 2016-01-29 04:55:10
Indeed. In fact, the system is very much designed so that miners will work to eliminate their competition. Normally, this is a really good thing! Bitcoin's design channels that energy into the creation of faster and more energy-efficient mining hardware. As a result, Bitcoin becomes significantly more secure against attacks.
Unfortunately, a very large or non-existant cap changes that. Rather than investing in mining hardware, a miner could instead invest in better network connectivity, more RAM and better CPUs. Then, they pump blocksize all the way to 11 to eliminate their competition. Unlike eliminating competition through making their mining hardware obsolete, this not only causes miners to not spend as much money on the actual hashpower, but it also **reduces** the hashpower on the network due to an increase in orphans. An attacker doesn't have to worry about either of those things (beefy non-hashing equipment and orphans), so this is great for them.
It's amazing how even a subtle change to the system can have major effects on the incentives, but that's why we need to be so careful.

That's not what the technical debate is about. The technical debate is about what the implications of changing that one\* line are.
\*It's not just one line that needs to be changed, but for the sake of debate that is a good enough approximation.


That's a good point, but if you get too comfortable with that argument, someone like Luke-jr will probably perform that attack on an altcoin for funsies. Come to think of it, it'd probably be helpful if they did try that. That way, we'll have real data to talk about for that attack.






Largely due to things like P2Pool, the relay network, and of course SPV mining (unfortunately).


If that's the case, would that technically mean that you got the hard-fork blocksize increase like you were asking for? If so, great! I'll just not bother arguing against that because it is yet another "pointless and semantic debate". Seriously, we just went over why such unrelated arguments stifle the scalability debate.

The Poisson nature of blocks are such that it will always be 10 minutes on average, not 5 minutes, until your transaction makes it into a block. Sounds odd, I know, but you have to remember that blocks have no memory of when the last one was created in terms of whether or not one will be found at any given time in the future.
5 minutes of wait on average would be correct if blocks were found exactly every 10 minutes.

That doesn't seem right on it's face. So, let's break this down with an example:
Let's say that, in order to send me an email, you would be required to pay someone a few cents. If someone paid that and still sent you promotional/bulk emails, would you consider that to be spam?
Actually, that service already exists and you probably receive messages like that all the time. It's just so low tech that you often forget about it: the postal service. So, go through your mail. Did you get any spam? According to this argument, that is not possible. All of the letters you received must therefore be valuable.

Exactly! If Classic really wants to usurp Core, they should at the very least have a roadmap like Core does before they release. Hell, they can modify the existing one for all I care, as long as they can show that they can still accomplish it with the developers they have.

The neat part about how SegWit is designed is that we will start seeing an effective blocksize increase the moment just one person starts using it. It just won't be maximally effective until nearly everyone is using it, but that's fine.
Also, you don't *have to* upgrade your nodes, wallets, etc. to see a benefit from this. If other people are using SegWit, that frees up room for your old-style transactions.

I disagree. From what I've seen, *loves* to hype up companies that haven't released anything yet. This strongly reminds me of Circle's hype.
As for why this happens, that's easy: bitcoiners have an extremely strong financial incentive to promote these companies. Before they release anything, nobody can really denounce your claim that said company is going to "make bitcoin great again". By making these indisputable claims, people believe they can pump the price of bitcoin. Once it is released, however, you can no longer do that, so everyone just moves on to the next new thing.
Do companies come in here hoping to abuse that incentive? Probably. Impossible to prove that, though.

Indeed, so if the devs end up agreeing with that, I don't think that there will be any pushback from the other stakeholders. The problem is that they don't agree with that. Because this is a highly technical issue, I think that many of the people that make up the other stakeholders would be right to be wary about proceeding without the dev team's support. What the people who are arguing that we should proceed anyway seem to be saying is that deferring to the development team for a highly technical issue is wrong. Hence the personal attacks against the developers.
Interestingly enough, the tactics that *do* work are exactly what you think they would be: presenting data to the developers to convince them that they may be wrong. That's exactly what the Scaling Bitcoin conferences were all about. And out of that conference, we got a softfork method of implementing Segregated Witness, which also happened to give us the opportunity to effectively raise the blocksize via a softfork while we are at it. Unlike extension blocks, it's not even that big of a deal to do it this way, since SegWit is such a great addition to bitcoin on its own that it would make sense to add it even without the blocksize debate. That's why it's so awesome.
@_date: 2016-01-08 00:17:39
There is a strong incentive for miners to eliminate their competition. Normally, this is good because it leads to a more secure Bitcoin. However, with this, all you need is for a majority of the hashpower to consider using large blocks as an acceptable means of eliminating competition to create an infinite loop of raising the blocksize.
When the blocksize goes up, fewer miners will be okay with a further increase. But, some will be forced to stop mining, so their 'vote' no longer gets counted. If the hashpower that stops mining is greater than or equal to the hashpower that stopped supporting a further increase, you create a loop that will eventually end up with 2-3 miners remaining and a crazy large blocksize that creates a high cost barrier for someone new to enter the mining scene.

There is protection from this, but it's entirely social. What I think you really meant was: "why isn't there *automated* protection against swathes of miners absconding?"
The answer to that is surprisingly simple: Bitcoin makes the assumption that over 50% of the mining power is "honest". It does plenty of things to encourage that, but there is no way to outright force it.
Consider another situation where 90% of the mining power could go missing: a disaster where the internet connections between continents is fully severed. How can any automated system distinguish between that event and something like 2x? So, a decision was made upfront to assume the former over the latter. Most other cryptocurrency made the opposite assumption, whether or not they even realized it. Which assumption is better is up to you to decide.

In terms of infrastructure, 2013 was probably the sweet spot.

It's more like you go to a merchant that uses Euros and you pay with your Visa card that is denominated in USD. They don't directly accept USD, but they accept Visa which can make the conversion for you.
This distinction is important since cryptocurrencies don't keep a static exchange rate with each other. In my Visa example, what you basically have is that the buyer prefers to keep their money in USD either for convenience or perceived stability relative to who they normally transact with, and same for the seller but for EUR.

This is a fact that is easily forgotten. Most of the properties of Bitcoin are not new or revolutionary. Consider Liberty Reserve or other such systems that existed before it: they had irreversible transactions, they had anonymous transactions, they had rapid settlement. However, governments took them out fairly quickly. Knowing that, would you be comfortable leaving money in that system? Hell no. This made the economy of those systems very inefficient.
With Bitcoin, you know that no government can seize your money, no matter what. You can leave money in bitcoin. This creates a much more efficient economy where you can take advantage of opportunities immediately. This creates real value in the real world.
Unfortunately, it's hard to put a monetary value on that security until it is gone. Not to mention, most people can't easily distinguish whether or not any given online currency has that security. It's a tough situation to be in.

Even then, that doesn't tell us anything. The time window in which this occurred was small enough that BitcoinXio could have seen the post in either of the two states depending on when he loading the page. Mods don't receive any kind of warning when they click to remove a comment that has been updated since they loaded the page.
If BitcoinXio saw the comment in its initial state, I don't disagree with the removal of the comment. I think that it was very helpful for you to have brought that version of the comment up, so thank you for that. However, it is entirely possible that when it was removed, it was in the state nullc said it was in, but BitcoinXio thought it was in the original state. Both sides might be in the right. So, I say we should just blame the Reddit software. Sound good?

There are major advantages to stores keeping open channels to the Lightning Network. You see, stores receive significantly more inbound transactions than outbound transactions that they send out. Because of that, any time they would have to spend the bitcoins that they received, they would have to make massive transactions (in terms of bytes) to consolidate those transaction outputs. That means massive Bitcoin network fees if they only accepted standard bitcoin transactions. Lightning would do this consolidation for you without pushing a bunch of tiny outputs on to the Bitcoin network.
Stores also tend to send most of the money they receive fairly quickly since they have to replenish their inventory and/or pay their employees. Because of that, the channel won't be entirely one-sided and need to be constantly updated on the block chain to add more bitcoins to one side. This makes the channel even more efficient.
As for why *you* would use Lightning, you're right. Initially, there's not much use for you keeping a channel open. You, as a person, tend to receive large (in value) transactions fairly rarely. You don't see much advantage from the consolidation that Lightning does for you.
Same thing for balanced channels. You currently probably do not spend most of your bitcoins within a few days of receiving them.
However, that will eventually change. Imagine a future where you get paid in bitcoin (via Lightning since your employer likely has a channel already). Also imagine that most of your expenses can be done in bitcoin. Most people tend to spend most of their currently USD (or whatever Fiat) income pretty quickly. They also do it to many different entities. Now it makes sense for you to use Lightning. This circular effect will push most everything to Lightning. It'll be great!

They are doing no such thing. Assuming that the court order survives Coinbase's legal challenge, all Coinbase will do is pass over all of the raw information. The IRS can then interpret it however they want to for the purposes of finding people to audit. If you are selected for being audited by the IRS, you will be fine as long as you maintained your own records and reported them appropriately. Honestly, if you self-reported anything at all it is unlikely that you would be targeted by the IRS unless it is quite obvious that there may be a huge discrepancy. If you failed to report anything at all, though, you should be really worried. Go back and amend your previous returns right now.

If you understand why the anti-doxxing rule exists, it become much easier to properly interpret the intention of Reddit's administration.
Here's a simple test you can do to determine if a post contains dox:
1) Does this post encourage people to gather and post more personal information?
2) Does this post encourage people to use the personal information to negatively affect the real lives of the people linked to said personal information?
Given that this post is phrased more like a completed report rather than an attempt to find more evidence, it doesn't fail the first test. As for the second test, this isn't a post that is primarily about magmahindenberg, so the indirectly-linked personal information about him in that article isn't a problem. As for Roger Ver, he is a very public figure, so it's fine that the article states his name. If this would be considered to be dox in spite of that, then so would every anti-Trump article.
It's grey enough that I'm sure that the admins would allow it. Or at the very least, you wouldn't get in trouble for not removing it. At the end of the day, that is all that matters. If a mod somewhere decides to remove it on their own, they should do so with the full understanding that are doing this entirely of their own accord.

This was always public knowledge. Hell, he posted about it on his own blog in 2006. You have to understand that we just had to deal with working with these kind of people back then and hope for the best. That's why we almost never brought it up.


I believe he said that he leaked this information out on an anonymous account. Sure, it would have been nice if he posted such information in a more authoritative manner, but I don't blame him for taking the more legally safe route in case he was wrong. Even if he was right (which he was), most of the damage was already done.
Regardless, Mark would have just called him a disgruntled employee and we would have believed that. That's how gullible we were back then.

One thing I would like people to start discussing is how dangerous the 75% mining power threshold is.
If the original chain still has 25% mining power, it can recover after one difficulty adjustment. For 8 weeks blocks will take 40 minutes, which isn't terrible.
If we instead used a 95% threshold, bringing the original chain to 5%, just the first difficulty period will last 40 weeks with 200 minutes per block. Because of the factor of four limit to difficulty changes, it will take three difficulty periods to recover. This is almost guaranteed to kill the original chain, leaving us with a single bitcoin. XT didn't go this route.

Look at a log chart. Amazon is staying linear on that kind of chart, Bitcoin is going exponential on it.
If you remove the bubbles from Bitcoin's history, it looks pretty similar to Amazon, yes. So, if you have a bunch of money that you don't really care about, putting it in Bitcoin is not a bad idea. But, that was never the point of the OP. The point was that if you invest more than you can afford to lose in the short term and know that you would not be able to withstand a drop to $1k or less for an extended period of time without being pressured to sell at a major loss, you should re-evaluate your investment decision.
That is why we always push for dollar-cost-averaging: you put in what you don't need from every paycheck and HODL until you hit the moon. Over the long term, even an investment at bubble prices will do exceptionally well, at least according to past performance. The key is not to sell when you are down 90%.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:25:29
Ah, yes. The classic "New Paradigm".
Just because Bitcoin is an amazing and revolutionary technology (perhaps even quite literally "revolutionary" in that it might cause entire countries to collapse!) doesn't prevent it from having classic bubbles. It only means that the resulting crash *probably* won't send the price back below the initial base of the bubble, in this case ~$1000. Everything down to that point is *highly likely*, not because Bitcoin isn't totally incredible, but because there is currently a massive gap between what the changes to the fundamentals would indicate the price to be and the insane speculative levels we are at right now.

To be fair, only one of the two comments in question were posted by approved posters. The main one in question was one that was manually approved within 180 seconds.
...which makes total sense because a mod wanted to reply to it as an example. It also makes sense that the comment that was used for this was so recent: the mod queue lists posts and comments by newest first. We know that the comment was flagged by Automoderator, so that's not much of a logical leap.
Just wanted to clear this up before people start accusing you of omitting facts.

We don't specifically hunt down brigading attempts, if that's what you're asking. We delete them when they are reported and we are able to verify that members of this community were posting there, but we don't keep track of how many times we've done this for each subredddit. Not to mention, we consider it the responsibility of the linked subredddit to let us know their preference for how we link to them. By default we require the "np" prefix, but we can either whitelist them (no longer requiring np) or blacklist them upon request. These seem to be pretty sane defaults to me.
Our modmail history seems to disagree with your claim. If you contacted us at all, it was via a comment reply to a post that we never read.

I don't really like how Mike is just dismissing the hard fork vs soft fork argument when comparing BIP 101 (XT) to BIP 16 (P2SH) without addressing the counter-arguments people had on the linked article. The thing I really like about Gavin's posts is that he knows how to completely destroy the arguments made by the other side. I want that. I want to lose this. But it's hard to accept the things someone is suggesting when they don't even acknowledge your arguments.
Just like how Peter Todd and friends fail to acknowledge that zero-conf is a spectrum, Mike is doing the same thing with forks.

@_date: 2015-08-16 07:05:32


Indeed. And discussion of them will then be just as banned.
Just like many people in the blocksize debate, you are confusing the present with the future. Yes, right now it is just an alternative client. However, once the hard coded fork activates, it becomes an alt-coin.
Should we allow Etherum posts just because they used bitcoin in their pre-sale? You will probably say yes, but that is why we are especially strict against alt-coins. You see, once we allow one alt-coin to post things like that, the shilling for other new alt-coins that do the same thing begins.
This is not theoretical, this has actually happened in the past.

In these situations, people will dox the moderators (post all of their personal information). Then, other people will harass the moderator's place of employment to the point where:
a) The mod gets fired.
b) The mod is forced to step down.
They also often physically threaten the mod's family and friends. Personally, I know that is an empty threat since nothing was ever done to even the most hated figures in bitcoin, but try telling that to the moderator's family.
All of the above was done to Theymos in the past 24 hours.

Indeed. That was my impression from previous discussions about why such a mechanism wouldn't be added. If it really was added, I'm curious how they went about preventing that. I may have to look for this code later, if it exists, and do a git blame on it to find the relevant discussion.
@_date: 2015-08-17 17:51:15
Extension blocks would roughly *double* the complexity of the bitcoin code and protocol. It is indeed a compromise solution, but it is one where everyone loses.
It's like if two people are arguing over who gets the last cookie and they decide to throw the cookie away and eat muffins instead.
Since it only requires a soft-fork, we should only consider it if everything else has failed and the blocks are already completely full.

People tend to get this weird idea that 10%+ increases per day are totally sustainable and that, worst case, it will probably only drop 20-50% in the case of a crash. People need to understand that a 90% drop is not only possible, but extremely likely based on previous bubbles.
Earlier today I saw someone say that you should buy now because if we get to $25k, it will only crash to $20k! No. If we get to $25k and it then crashes, expect to see a drop to ~$6-8k followed by a bounce back up a bit, then a very slow drop to $2.5k. This scenario has happened before. It might even be worse this time, who knows. Either way, you better be prepared for that to happen.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:48:08


Just the fanatics, who unfortunately make up a large number of the posts we get. Sadly, the nature of Reddit is that subreddits tend toward becoming an echo-chamber, so the mods have to do what they can to prevent that. That is why I support maintaining good relations with the community.
@_date: 2015-08-28 03:38:11
Mike, I'm not arguing that one way is better than the other going forward. All I'm asking is that you acknowledge that hard forks exchange securing old nodes with securing SPV nodes, and therefore should be treated slightly differently.
With soft forks, only one "Bitcoin" exists at least 50% of the time. With hard forks, both chains still exist as the longest chain, with the client you use being the deciding factor on which one you consider to be Bitcoin. This remains true 24/7. The clients never come back into agreement. Again, I'm not arguing that that is a bad thing, just that it's different.
@_date: 2015-08-23 06:44:24
It technically is, but because of the two-way peg the currency itself can continue to be expressed in the backing currency. For example, you don't see signs saying "Medium coffee: 2 VisaCoin". Well, unless you're talking about a gas station I suppose, but as long as there is no (or very little) conversion cost to get back to the backing currency, what I said holds true.

Follow that formula and you can convince people of almost anything.

Again, I agree with you on that. The point is to keep honest people honest, much like locking a door.
If you take down identity info, that doesn't mean a whole lot if every person could trivially change the output via full-RBF. People would do it all the time since you would have too many people to go after. That's kind of similar to shoplifting: if you don't have any deterrents in place, such as alarms by the door, you'll be wiped out. The alarms don't physically stop people from leaving, nor do they deter determined theives, but it brings the level of theft down to levels that can be individually investigated.
My point is that security is not a binary state, but rather it's something that exists on a spectrum. Full-RBF reduces that security to the point where zero-conf is unviable for ALL types of transactions.

I have now reviewed the entire mod mail history. You have never contacted us for any reason over the entire existence of this subreddit. As a subredddit moderator, you should be very well aware of the fact that mods do not review every single post, let alone every comment. If you requested this via a comment in the past, we probably didn't ever read it.
And yes, this lazy attitude of blaming the admins for every little thing and assuming that everyone can read your mind is the problem with Reddit right now.
As the main AutoModerator rule creator in this subreddit, I find it quite insulting that you consider me to be incompetent given that we have among the most complicated AutoModerator rules on Reddit.
Lucky for you, I don't involve personal feeling in my moderation decisions. If this were any other subredddit, they would have not made this change just to spite you. Here in we process moderation requests in the same way regardless of how we came to learn about it (assuming we see it in the first place). Had you just messaged us we would have done the exact same thing, but probably faster. If you're going to continue being a subredddit moderator, you need to learn to treat your fellow moderators with a little more respect. If you cannot do that, you should step down. As it is, you have caused many people to lose respect for the mod team today. I pray that you can get that back.

@_date: 2015-07-24 18:02:30


(I'm assuming that 'it' = 'zero-conf')
Of course, but that is not the "broken" that I am referring to. You are saying that if it is possible to double-spend outputs that were spent in an unconfirmed transaction under any circumstance, it is broken. That is indisputable, which is why that is not what I am arguing about.
The "breaking" that I am referring to is making it possible for anyone to have an almost guaranteed chance of being able to double-spend an unconfirmed transaction minutes afterward even without having planned on doing so prior to sending the transaction. Since that is the typical situation, it is the far more important one to look at.


We have gained a way for miners to feel good in knowing that they aren't assisting people in ripping others off, thereby helping to keep zero-conf feasible.


In terms of average bandwidth usage over time and amount of processing needed, yes, you are correct. However, this is more efficient in terms of block space usage. Just as efficient as full-RBF, in fact.

It takes 1-2 years after code is complete for non-emergency hardforks to activate. That's the urgency. Nobody has said that we need this additional capacity today.

On the contrary, if 5 developers could make the decision the block size issue would be solved right now. We actually allowed development to get so decentralized that concenus is almost impossible.
I know that it seems like only a few people matter, but once that core group decides on something, they need to then convince:
1) other developers
2) security experts
3) miners
4) the distributors/outreach groups (bitcoin.org, bitcointalk, etc.)
5) the exchanges
6) the merchants
7) the users
Any single group has full veto power if most of the group decides to assert that power.

understands bitcoin more than you realize. He built the first block explorer back before the bitcoin client provided block information for you. Hell, the block format wasn't even documented back then.
The problem here is that Mike managed to completely miss the point despite all but saying it himself: soft forks completely obliterate the previous version of bitcoin, whether people like it or not. Therefore, since the previous bitcoin no longer exists, it is safe to give the name to the new version.
With hard forks, that isn't guaranteed to happen. Bitcoin was *designed* to recover from dropping to 25% mining power, so a 75% activation threshold for a hard fork is *extremely* dangerous. It isn't until you hit around 5% that you activate bitcoin's economic self-destruct, causing a death spiral of longer and longer block times. This self-destruct has been proven in alt-coins, hence why most alt-coins no longer allow it to happen.
That's the real problem here. If the previous bitcoin is still able to exist by recovering from the loss in mining power, which fork gets to keep the name? Theymos asserts that in such a situation, it is the original that keeps the name. If you want to argue against the censorship, that is the point you need to argue against.

Thank you. I really appreciate that you are willing to discuss this with me.


Absolutely! This has always been the case. If you notice, we don't ban discussions about the blocksize or any BIP.


No. Ultimately, this subreddit has little effect on bitcoin anymore. I learned that a long time ago. The only purpose served by banning direct XT discussion is to avoid setting a precident that alt-coins can be spammed here as long as you use the new "alt-fork" loophole. If we say XT is fine, we're bringing personal opinions into the mix.


Yes, just like I often do for dogecoin and Etherum posts.


No. Subredddits should be as granular as possible so people don't have to see topics that they don't care about. Even if 75% of the subreddit supports Ron Paul (this really happened), the other 25% shouldn't have to deal with it just because the demographics match up.




Maybe on accident, but I would support restoring the post upon appeal. Again, that is directly useful to readers interested only in bitcoin.


If you ask a question about that, no. That is relevant only to XT users. That would be like posting a question here asking which exchanges support Dogecoin.
If you're announcing a new wallet or compiled data on wallets, then that would be fine.

For the most part, we don't. However, as Mike alluded to, those thoughts were used to establish the social contract that many people relied on when deciding whether or not to become part of the bitcoin ecosystem. That's why the things he said in 2008-2010 are still relevant when we need to make ideological decisions rather than purely technical decisions. In fact, if he came back today it wouldn't matter what he says now, since what matters is our interpretation of the things he said that convinced people to join bitcoin, not the person who said it.

Your thought (in one of the replies in here) about why we added this was correct: whenever we've had to delete highly upvoted comments that were hijacking useful discussion, it ended up creating a worse problem in that the resulting thread was unreadable and made the moderation appear worse than it really was.

The biggest counter-argument that hard forks are different enough from soft-forks to be treated differently is that soft forks completely destroy the old bitcoin and that such destruction is guaranteed as long as just over 50% of the hash power enforces it. With a hard fork, the point where that happens is not as clear. 75% could indeed be above that level, but nobody has really investigated that. That's the kind of analysis I want to see.
In case you were wondering, here's my definition of "destroyed": the odds that there will be a fork of 100 consecutive blocks generated within 1 year that follow the old rules but not the new rules AND would be accepted as the longest chain by old clients is below 0.1% in reasonable models based off of evidence from situations that involve similar human behavior. There are some arbitrary numbers there, true, but they seem reasonable enough.

Other than personal curiosity, they don't really care what you invested in. They just need to know the risk profile and how much money is involved. If they ask, just deflect the question towards what to do about the sum of money that you are discussing today.
If they get pushy about wanting to know what the investment was in or if they try to push you to sell everything, find a different financial advisor.

I would like to point out that in the US, it is illegal to buy or sell bitcoins as your business from unlicensed individuals unless you have a money transmitter license. What that "business" part means is undefined by the law, but it's safe to say that this would count. Both your "friend" and his customer WILL be caught if they do this.
Stick to only buying when you otherwise would have bought anyway.
This is not legal advice, nor am I a lawyer. With this amount of money in play, he may want to invest in one.

Doesn't matter. Any one of the versions of the transactions can hit the blockchain and it will work itself out.


Yes, because doing so proves that you aren't trying to screw someone over. It also means that if the first transaction hits the blockchain rather than the modified version, the second transaction is still valid.
It's clear to me that you don't care about the technical benefits of full-RBF. You just want to break zero-conf.

Indeed. Buying and selling bitcoin as a personal investment, whether or not that "person" is a business (since businesses are considered people, as per SCOTUS), is exempt from needing a license. Turning around and immediately reselling the bitcoins does not meet the standards for that exemption unless some extraordinary event occurred (such as realizing that you bought too much). You can't give such excuses for each time, however. The judge and jury (if you have a jury trial) are not stupid.
You might be fine if you expose yourself to the market for a few days before selling, but somehow I feel that the friend wouldn't want to risk that =P

@_date: 2015-07-16 03:25:30
Only the last* one ever hits the blockchain, that's what. The only difference between this and full-RBF is that the amended output signs off on the change. If you don't like this (assuming there aren't any technical flaws that I'm missing), then you don't like full-RBF either.
By the way, you can keep using that process to repeatedly add more outputs without creating extra change. It's not a one-time thing per transaction.
*unless the first one does, but that can happen in any type of transaction replacement.

Except for a small number of radicals that I could count on one hand (out of over 100,000 people), that never happened. That whole idea was a strawman attack used to push people to the opposite extreme.
The Core position has never changed. It has only recently been made more specific, but that's it. At a high level, they always intended on first making a block size increase safe, then executing it. And that's exactly what they are doing.

It is entirely possible to do that in a safe manner with transaction flattening. I can't possibly be the first person to come up with this, but all you have to do to get this efficiency in a FSS-RBF implementation is make it so that an output that is used in another transaction can be replaced with the output(s) of the later transaction.
Essentially, if a script signs something that says to re-assign the value to another script, we can safely pretend that that output never existed.
Example: say we have tx1 with input a and outputs b and c. c then gets used as the sole input to tx2. tx2 has outputs d and e. You can safely replace tx1 with tx1'. tx1' has an input a, and outputs b, d, and e.
I *believe* that this has no more technical downsides than full-RBF in terms of DoS capability, but I could be wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:51:18
If you manage to DDoS a watchtower that just happens to be what is used by one or more of your channel partners, there is an easy solution to this for the watchtower: pass new transaction information that comes in to another node on another network. Therefore, with a DDoS in progress, you can prevent the watchtower from agreeing to watch new channel updates that are submitted to them (which would show as a warning to clients that don't have secondary watchtowers set up), but you can't stop them from acting on anything they already accepted. This is similar to how miners protect themselves from DDoS.
If you compromise them, they still could restore from backup.
And all of this pre-supposes that the client on the other end of the channel stays offline continuously for several days at a time. Oh, and that they didn't use multiple watchtowers. Also, they would have had to not learn that a wide-scale attack was in progress.
It's just not worth the risk to try publishing an old state under any circumstance.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:41:30
It is still the case that you will be able to tell what is true once you have the information, it's just that this information is stored in fewer places that you specifically define. That's how you save money.
You could, for example, set up live backups of the channel state to 20 different untrusted locations and as long as just one of them sends you the real most recent state data, you will know to ignore the old data that the other locations have.
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:51:36


Not exactly. You can use your loss carryover from previous years against an *unlimited* amount of capital gains in a later tax year, up to the amount of the carryover, of course. *In addition*, you can  apply up to $3k of carryover loss against your ordinary income per year.
For example, let's say that you had a bad year where you ended up with a net loss of $10k. For that tax year, you apply $3k against your ordinary income, leaving you with a carryover of $7k. Next year, you net a $2k gain. First, you apply $2k of carryover loss to that gain, then you deduct $3k from your income, leaving you with a carryover loss of $2k. In the next year after that, you net a gain of $3k. You deduct $2k from that gain and pay taxes on the $1k of gain that remained. Since you used up all of your carryover losses against your gains, you are unable to deduct anything from you ordinary income. $0 of carryover loss remains for the next year.

It's not going to help much, but if you haven't done so already, you should include transaction and trading fees in your cost basis.

This has been my experience as well. People were telling me that they bought a few hundred dollars worth of various cryptocurrency and that they knew a single "high-roller" who bought a thousand dollars worth of cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2018-03-26 16:11:05


Fundamentally, no, there is not. However, they risk having the channel force-closed under normal circumstances where you do know the current state and they still do lie, which isn't optimal for them. If they request the state from you rather than you requesting it from them, they have no idea if *you* are lying, which means that if they take the risk that you are telling the truth by publishing an old transaction, you or your watchtower could claim the penalty.
All that being said, once we get production-ready clients, there should be no reason for you to depend on the counter-party telling the truth, anyway, since you would be backing up every state change to a remote location. This isn't a problem since every step of the Lightning process has contingencies for if an update isn't acknowledged, so you just don't acknowledge an update until you have it backed up. That simple.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:00:52


I'm pretty sure that isn't correct, minus a few exceptions. The reason being that "using" a Bitcoin, for any purpose, not just personal, is really difficult.
There are a few ways that a Bitcoin can be used:
1) as a means to timestamp information
2) as a means of recording a transfer of an unrelated asset (think colored coins)
3) as an intermediate medium for transferring value.
Where I believe this claim comes from is that last one I mentioned. Yes, if you buy Bitcoin specifically so that you can buy a certain product, then a loss couldn't be deducted. However, if you buy Bitcoin then several months later trade a small portion of that to buy a product, that wouldn't be personal use. It all comes down to what your intention was when you purchased the Bitcoin, not how you happened to trade it into something else.
Of course, you then have to prove all of that, so I can see how the conservative answer would be to just not trade Bitcoin for anything other than USD, but I believe that this was more nuanced than you made it out to be.
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:04:30
Yup. That's why I feel that it's a little unfair to claim that the average joe will never be able to use Lightning because of this event without claiming the same thing for Bitcoin as well. Just like that client issue that caused a person to lose funds in Bitcoin, this client issue also has technical solutions in the works that would prevent such issues from occurring in the future. Just give it time.
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:39:40
Sounds about right. The whole reason why developers are focusing so much effort into privacy in Lightning Network is for the very reasons you stated. Although it's an improvement in some scenarios, it's worse in others.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:41:53
The term "backup" was never really accurate for Bitcoin in the first place. Even with wallet "backups" today, there is no way to restore them to a previous state, no matter how far back you go. Once you send bitcoins to someone, you can't just pull up your backup to get them back.
All that Lightning does is that it pushes the burden of keeping redundant copies off of the broadcast network directly on to you. In return, you can reduce the costs associated with transacting.
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:26:03
All you have to do is just not acknowledge the state change until it is replicated to another device. This isn't different from how databases in general computing handle power loss and the like.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:35:25
In addition to what said, there's also an additional short-term incentive to miners to have larger blocks: the larger the blocks, the harder it is for other miners to compete. The more competing miners you can get to drop out, the larger your share of the block rewards and fees you get.
That is absolutely stupid in the long-term, since you would eventually find *yourself* having to drop out because you would become a victim of your own greedy strategy. But it's great in the short term. That's especially why you will see that large miners are all for larger and larger block sizes.

A long time ago, if you didn't manually back up your Bitcoin wallet after each transaction, you risked losing almost everything. All beta software starts like this, give it some time.
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:24:25
Yes, actually. You can either back up state to thousands of nodes (the blockchain) and pay the appropriate cost of doing that, or you can back up to a smaller number of nodes that you control or semi-trust and pay the appropriate cost for that. Or, I guess, you can not back up at all, if you don't mind the risk. This is what freedom is.
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:30:21
That was my thought. It seems to me that the failure mode for privacy in Lightning is that someone could determine that one specific address sent to another specific address. The only real difference in Lightning is that those addresses get re-used, whereas in Bitcoin, they generally don't. However, it's not all that difficult to perform a cluster analysis on those addresses in Bitcoin in the first place, so the address reuse that is needed in Lightning isn't as bad as it may sound. Any improvement on top makes a huge difference compared to standard Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:29:41
A new keypair was generated with each transaction for the change address. There was a person who, indeed, lost almost everything because of this.
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:43:19
You come up with the best guess you can with the records you have.
If you want to be safe, you can do this: for the acquisition date, put down the earliest date that you can prove that you had the coins. If you sent the coins from the mining site to your wallet, that date would be great. For the cost basis, use the lowest price between that date and when you have a receipt for purchasing the mining hardware. For claiming the income side of that mining income, use the highest price between those dates.
If that sounds absurd, then just keep looking for additional records to narrow things down.
For trades, look for emails that you may have received that confirm the transaction. If you don't have those, use bank records and Bitcoin transactions to reconstruct things as best as you can. Take you best guess at a date of sale (erring towards earlier dates than later dates) and sale price (erring towards higher prices rather than lower prices).

Encouraging an emotional response (whether by trolling, troll-baiting, ad hominem attacks, insulting people, etc.) that distracts from a discussion.

I see why this appears to be the case, but I can assure you: this was all the doing of our moderation team. We kept it in stealth mode for awhile to try out some new policies along with a corresponding Automoderator update, but things seem to be going well.
Without looking at the exact numbers, I'd estimate that mod actions are up 20x, mod removals are up 3x and bans are up 5x compared to about 2 weeks ago. If other mods have different estimates (or hard numbers), feel free to chime in.

Indeed, that used to be the policy. Over the past year, it has slowly been eroded away as we've upgraded Automoderator. As of last week, it is completely gone.
The main reason for that policy sticking around for as long as it did was because we didn't have the tools to make bans be meaningful. Because of that, we figured that it was better to allow people to personally tag trolls once rather than having to constantly tag the same person every time they changed accounts. However, the Automoderator upgrades I made have now made bans much more meaningful, so that is no longer a factor.

Why would you *want* freedom in a modern civilized society? By that, I'm referring to the "true" unrestricted freedom that you are referring to. If I was alone in the middle of nowhere, that might be fine, but I would not want people to have the freedom to murder anyone they like in our crowded modern society.
Freedom must necessarily be restricted to some degree, but no more than is necessary. This subreddit's community has proven over an extended period of time that freedoms needed further restrictions, so we are responding accordingly. I will ensure that this doesn't go farther than it has to.

Keep in mind that this only allows them to safely mine blocks with zero transactions (other than the coinbase, of course). As the block reward decreases, SPV mining becomes more and more worthless.
Of course, that's assuming that a soft-fork that makes SPV mining more dangerous/impossible isn't implemented, making the whole point useless to bring up.
If you really *do* think that SPV mining should remain viable, would we then have to change the block rewards to remain as a larger chunk of the block reward indefinitely as part of the hardfork?

They most certainly did. In fact, the ability to discuss it here was better than other places.
Contrary to popular belief, we weren't censoring people who were trying to gather concenus to change. What we censored were the people who were misleading people into consensus by claiming that the concenus already existed when that was clearly not the case. There were posts where people were needing help with Bitcoin Core and people were like: "ah, I know the problem! You are using an old version. Download the newest version here: &lt;link to XT&gt;." Did you know that we went out of the way to keep the XT manifesto up, despite numerous people trying to hijack the post?
If you want to form a concenus, that's fine. It's just that you'll need to do it on the merits of the proposal, not by using populist tactics.

Altcoins are off topic unless you are purely discussing the technical side of things. We actually have a very good reason for doing this, too: prior to making altcoins off topic, almost every post would be about yet another coin that does nothing new but that people are trying to pump. Bitcoin news was completely lost in the noise.
As for the price decline, most price posts in general are now off topic, for the same reason: it buried actual bitcoin news. If you want to hear price news, create a multi-reddit for bitcoin+bitcoinmarkets. That would give you the same feed as if we allowed that here.

This is correct! But, I wasn't talking about BTC. ;)


None of the BCH wallets would have ever generated a SegWit address, correct. However, a 3* address (better known as a Pay-to-Script-Hash address) doesn't necessarily *have* to be a SegWit address. It could, for example, be a multi-sig address. Before SegWit, 3* addresses were rare, but clients had to support being able to send to them to allow for situations where the recipient, say, wants to instantly lock those funds down by requiring multiple signatures to spend it later without requiring them to keep a server online that would have needed to create a new transaction to sweep the funds.
What happened here is that the seller gave the OP an address that their *BTC* wallet generated. The OP, not realizing that BCH is not BTC, sent BCH to that address. Their BCH client didn't block that send because it can't distinguish between SegWit addresses and other uses of 3* addresses.

Never be afraid to report something. The vast majority of reports result in no action taken, so feel free to let us sort it out.
Reports will not automatically result in a ban. Only human senior mods can do that. They *are* used as a factor in some Automoderator rules, but that will only remove the individual post. All Automoderator removals are reviewed within about 3 hours, and we constantly re-tune the rules to prevent false positives, so again, don't worry about it.
In a recent test, I found that there are far more verbal reports than reports via the report button. That needs to change.

@_date: 2015-09-08 08:00:29


Most developers agree with you. 90% of the developers that have made commits to Bitcoin-Core said that they support raising the blocksize to whatever is technically feasible.


I agree with most of your post, but I especially wanted to call this part out. We need to make some kind of decision, and we need to make it soon. I feel that a hard deadline has been set in place with XT that such a decision must take place by the end of the year. You won't hear many anti-XT people say this, but I am glad that Gavin lit a fire under the asses of everyone else. I just wish that he would have put the fire out after everyone's pants got charred. He made his point, he doesn't have to stick with it. Mike Hearn, on the other hand, is really taking advantage of the whole situation as part of a power-grab, which really sucks.


Good for you. Seriously, that's awesome. I hope you stick around.
However, in general, facts don't matter much in this subreddit. As long as someone keeps saying something enough, people will get tired of refuting them. With nobody refuting the thing anymore, it becomes accepted consensus. Sure, at that point more people will come out of the woodwork with the facts that refute the argument, but it's a much harder fight that both sides will ultimately lose. That's what has happened with XT. As for both sides having lost, check out this rare gem that is unfortunately not very rare these days:

But at the same time, the proportion of the block reward that comes from fees has dramatically increased as well: both in terms of absolute bitcoins and value in USD. To SPV mine means giving that up, making it harder for SPV miners to compete 
@_date: 2015-09-16 14:50:31


That wasn't censored. What we censored were posts where that was a foregone conclusion that was not up for debate. Posts like: "You can download the most up-to-date Bitcoin client here: &lt;link to XT&gt;", or "PSA: Hard fark in January, make sure you have the newest Bitcoin client!". Those types of posts were done specifically to mislead newbies.
Often, I'll let such posts stand if there isn't much risk if people believe the post. A hard fork is not one of those times. If there is anything that people should make their own decision about rather than having the crowd do it for them, it's hard forks.
I also might let a misleading post stay up if one of the top comments is someone pointing out how the post is misleading. That didn't happen with the XT debate. Anyone who argued against XT was declared a "small-blocker" (even if they supported some kind of increase) or a "Blockstream employee" (even if they have nothing to do with Blockstream). And of course, anyone that received those labels were summarily downvoted regardless of what they said.
The job of a moderator is to step in when the community fails to police itself. On Reddit, moderators serve no other purpose due to the voting system handling everything else.
Admittedly, some valid posts got caught in the crossfire, but that was not intentional. For a few days the mod team was overwhelmed, so some hasty moderation may have been done just to get through the mod queue. Additionally, we had no time to audit mod actions or deal with ban appeals. That made things way worse. However, now we have a larger mod team, so these problems should not occur again in the near future.
Hopefully this helps you better understand why we did what we did.
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:43:51


Like I said, there wasn't really the time or manpower to audit mod actions. As a result, reality may not have matched our intentions. This issue has since been resolved.
Also, things weren't removed just because they mentioned XT (again, at least not intentionally). It's just that a lot of the stuff at the time was either (1) complaints over moderation, which we asked people to move to the sticky to avoid spamming the subreddit, (2) not anything new, but upvoted anyway because it had to do with XT, (3) direct promotion of XT.

I know that this is hard to hear, especially in this age of slacktivism, but there is very little that the end users can do to *actually* support BIP 101 at this time.
If you want to actually do something, find some experts that support this BIP and can defend it. Then, raise funds for them to visit the people who make decisions at the various Bitcoin merchants.
If you are such an expert yourself, volunteer your time to do that.
Once the merchants are on board, you can get the miners and the users on board. But you can't do one before the other and expect much success.

On the contrary, he is *legally required* to spend all of the donated funds on a new forum, since that was what the funds were gathered for. He wasn't allowed to do anything else with that money. Tell me, what should he have done?
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:28:16
If it turns out to be a SegWit address (it probably is), then the recipient will also have to work directly with a miner to publish the transaction since SegWit transactions are not allowed over BCH's broadcast network. And all of this is besides the fact that anyone can steal these funds once the public key for that address is revealed, which happens once that address makes any transaction on any network.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:53:32

And I have, repeatedly. However, that does not justify allowing innocent posts with great discussion to be derailed. Would you rather that we instead just delete the OP whenever we have to delete a response to the top comment? Because other mods have expressed support for going down that path (since *post* deletions don't leave any visible evidence, unlike comment deletions), and that scares the shit out of me.

@_date: 2015-09-10 15:21:34
You certainly could have a system like this, but it has some interesting tradeoffs:
If you were to prune old transactions on your local node, someone could replay an old transaction to your node, assuming that address still held a balance, and your node would have no way of knowing that the transaction was already used. So, in order to prune old transactions, you would need to either keep track of the transaction hash forever or store a sequence number for each address. In the former case, that is worse than Bitcoin since Bitcoin only needs to store unspent transaction outputs. In the latter case, interesting things happen. For one, you would either need to require that transactions aren't accepted until their sequence number is next, or, if you allow transactions to skip sequence numbers, you would only be able to safely have one unconfirmed transaction per address at any time (assuming you want to ensure that every transaction clears).
At any rate, you can't get around the fact that each address, even empty ones, require data to be permanently stored. Unless, that is, you make it so that it costs money to create an address. By requiring people to keep a deposit on open addresses, you can implement a system where people have an incentive to close that address. When you close an address, you acknowledge that the network will no longer keep track of which transactions from that address have already occurred (via transaction hashes, sequence numbers or whatever). If you ever reopen that address, it would be on you to provide that information.
Now, address-based systems aren't all that bad. They have plenty of benefits as well. Ripple would be a good system to read about if you are interested in learning more. It's just that it's way easier to reason about the security of systems that are transaction-based.
@_date: 2015-09-28 15:39:08

Well, it would allow people to attack the network in a less wasteful and more obvious manner, which is a good thing. This is very much like how data transactions were specifically allowed: you can't stop them, but at least you can have people do them in a prunable manner.

Thank you, I really appreciate it. I'm glad to see that the opinion that I linked, regardless of how valid it may be, won't be lost in my soon-to-be-downvoted comment.


WARNING: Read beyond the first sentence of the below. It is not going to argue what you think it is going to.
To be fair to him, we also don't have 1 MB worth of transactions to put in the blocks yet, but that has happened quite a bit recently. Code doesn't differentiate between spam and what you consider to be real transactions. As we have seen with these "stress-tests" (more accurately, Denial-of-Service attacks against the blockchain), if someone *can* generate enough transactions to make us hit the upper limit, there is a good chance that someone *will*. This isn't about "conserving resources", this is about preventing spam from making it impossible for all but the richest people to run a full node.
Let me quote a statement that is very easy to miss in that post:


Does that *sound* like someone who thinks that we should stay at 1 MB forever?


Given the intended audience, it very well should be. Had this been posted on the bitcoin-development mailing list, that would be very inappropriate. However, in the context of it is very appropriate.
Imagine being a climate scientist 10 years ago, posting on Digg, and everyone is telling you and every other scientist that you're wrong about climate change existing because one famous guy said so. That is what you are currently doing to the Core team.

My guess is that they're going to do something similar to the maker/taker fee model of exchanges. Essentially, you get charged for the cost of cleaning the UTXOs up at the time that you create them instead of when you remove them. This is good because otherwise it could easily turn out that it costs more in fees to combine tiny UTXOs than they are worth.

If you would like to use the income from the sale of bitcoins, you will need to provide the full list of transactions that you've made on Coinbase over the last three months. Those transactions need to show that you held those bitcoins specifically in your Coinbase account for the past three months. If you didn't, but they were still in your possession for the past three months, you will need to go deeper in what you provide until you've provided the full ledger for every account that the bitcoins were part of for those three month.

In order for miners to even consider mining the transactions that can only be included in small blocks, the transactions would have to almost make up the difference in fees that the miner would have able to collect from mining the bigger block without those transactions.
As far as user experience goes, an attacker can already do this. That's what the recent DDoS attack was (and no, I refuse to call it a "stress test"). This way, at least we don't end up with a ton of blockchain bloat for the miners.

@_date: 2015-04-08 18:03:40
There's not really much point in me discussing this with a single person. I'd much rather do this publicly so that I don't have to repeat myself.
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:21:25
Well... maybe. You see, normally when this happens with alt-coins being sent to another currency's address, the answer would be "yes". In fact, had the address that was used here started with a "1", then that would have been the case.
Unfortunately, this address starts with a "3", so more likely than not this is a SegWit address. It might not be a SegWit address, but it probably is. Assuming that is the case, as soon as the public key for that address is revealed IN ANY WAY, anyone can spend the balance of that address, even miners. That is because Bitcoin Cash never put any protections in place to prevent people from sending to an address that it is incompatible with.
So, yes, the recipient MIGHT be able to work with a miner to return these funds. But, the slightest mistake could result in someone else taking them. There's no way to prove which of those scenarios ultimately occurred, either, so it's really just a matter of trust now.

The nice thing about a conference is that everyone in attendance is *required* to hear you out completely on your facts and opinions. If you attempt to interrupt a presenter or (at some conferences) even walk out of the room, you lose your opportunity to speak. That's something that just can't happen on the internet.

@_date: 2015-09-02 18:18:28


Indeed, it worked pretty well. Of course, it normally does anyway. Unfortunately, "pretty well" didn't include posts that went against the mob. Nor did it include posts that were unrelated to the scandal of the day.
When we turned moderation back on, the difference was night and day. There was actually *variety* on the front page. I never realized how much moderation could improve things until that moment.
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:51:03
Honestly, I was thinking about instituting a board of users for which their sole purpose is to detect censorship, but I haven't put a whole lot of thought into it. Know of any good example of this on Reddit?
As for now at this very moment, would de-mod me if I just unilaterally gave you temporary mod powers for this purpose. In addition, the stats are pretty embarrassing right now due to some broad filters being added by theymos that I am working on getting addressed, so an outside opinion agreeing with what all the mods know to be true doesn't really help. But again, I'm working on it.
Like I said, though: I would really like to hear of any long-term suggestions you may have. Convincing just one person doesn't do anybody any good.
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:37:28
I hopped on board the moment I found out about it, which was March 2011. Within a few months I became a Bitcointalk moderator because of how obsessed with it I was. Back then, I read every new thread that was posted there within 24 hours of the post, so that only made sense. That's not really doable now, but back then there were usually only around 100 new or updated threads per day, so it wasn't that difficult to keep up.
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:11:43
Thank you for this, and sorry for not replying earlier. Over the past few days, we have mostly implemented the policies that you've discussed (mostly because it was standard policy here already and we've finally gone back to that). However, it has seemed to make things worse.
As for the altcoin argument, if we accepted it as not being an altcoin, that would really put us in a pickle if someone else attempted this later (which, in my experience, always tends to happen with altcoins when they figure out a way to weasel themselves into the main bitcoin discussion areas). We would either have to admit that we were playing favorites by allowing XT-specific posts, or allow them to spam us. Altcoiners are very good at making their stuff not look like spam, so their stuff would certainly reach the front page. How would we deal with such a situation?
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:08:02
It's not. Both situations aren't good. However, for a community that claims that it is trying to get rid of dictators, we're really fucking good at creating new dictators. See: Mike Hearn with XT and now Roger Ver with bitcoin community sites.
If we're going to have a dictator regardless (which this situation has proven to be the case), I'd rather it be a guy with no external commercial interests.

We've instituted the most hardcore filters we've ever instituted in order to stop the paid spam. Because it's real users posting this stuff, there is no pattern we can block. Expect every post you (as in, anybody) make about Coin.mx to be automatically removed 
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:46:11
Just to be clear, the reason why posts like this are allowed is not because the author simply replaced "XT" in a sentence with "BIP 101" and called it good. It's the promotion aspect that matters.
For example, it is perfectly acceptable to post "I think Bitcoin should implement feature 'X' from Dogecoin/Litecoin/etc." It is not okay to post "Here's why you should switch to Dogecoin/Litecoin/etc."
The points that such posts bring up might be very similar, but how you frame it is important for keeping content in this subreddit relevant and useful.
Consider the Greece economic collapse posts: the ones that just posted the headline had discussions that were not too dissimilar from or before we deleted them for being off-topic. Bitcoin was only even brought up a handful of times. However, the threads that framed the discussion to Bitcoin were much more useful to furthering the Bitcoin cause. For example, those threads spawned questions about Bitcoin ATMs in Greece, how we can better promote Bitcoin in Europe and much more. That the power of correct framing.
That said, if you want to see threads that aren't framed to the Bitcoin perspective, there are other subredddits for that. That's the whole reason why subredddits have such narrow topics. If you would rather that subredddits be broad, just subscribe to And if you can't find a good subredddit to post something to with the framing you're going for, make that subreddit. It doesn't cost anything to do and Reddit doesn't limit subredddit creation to power users, so go nuts.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:58:41


Indeed, I haven't seen a single supporter say that XT is intended to create two separate long running chains. However, code doesn't care about people's intentions. As it is currently coded, the 75% miner activation threshold makes it fairly likely that the original bitcoin chain will remain viable for the people that don't change clients. I have brought this claim up several times, and yet nobody has gathered the evidence to dispute it like how Gavin did with the blocksize debate on his blog earlier this year.
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:41:09


I disagree. If you read every day, it is very easy to get that impression, so I understand why you think that. However, a lot has changed over the past year. It'd probably be helpful if someone made a compilation of what we've made progress on, but I have a few things:
1) Blocksize: One year ago, many people were saying things like "we should let Bitcoin hit the 1 MB limit for a while to let a fee market form". You don't really hear that anymore (other than as a strawman argument, of course).
2) Vision: This is still unresolved, but we've made progress on the payment network vs store of value debate. It has now shifted to payment network vs settlement network, and most scaling proposals try to (and are kind of actually able to) compromise between those two visions.
From a technical standpoint, it turns out that back then even **1 MB** blocks weren't really feasible. Now, they probably are (I don't know if that's true, but that's my impression from what I've heard the devs say). It turns out that the debate was premature at that point anyway, at least from the technical side.
Since I've been around since 2011, I've really learned not to take progress for granted. Without thinking about it, a person that was involved in bitcoin every day since then would think the same thing about bitcoin as you think about this debate. But massive progress has been made. In early 2011, your choices to buy bitcoin were limited to (1) PayPal to some guy for small amounts, (2) Cash mailed to some shady guy in Canada, (3) wiring your money to a buffoon in Japan. If you take the time to look back at things objectively, you would know that we haven't been caught in a rut for the past year. There is still hope for this debate.
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:17:53
The point is that users (where "users" is an undefined group of people that we can't deal with on an individual basis, like we can for employees) should not reasonably expect to personally gain anything by discussing a site.
The best way to show this is by answering this question: if you were really poor and had no sense of ethics, would you take the time to advertise for the company here even if you prefer their competitors?

Any features that could be applied to Bitcoin are relevant here, regardless of where they came from.

Mike Hearn had successfully riled up a mob. There was no good moderation decision that Theymos could have made.
1) Do nothing: The Bitcoin community would now consider XT to *be* Bitcoin. It likely would have successfully forked in January, but due to censorship by the community (downvotes) over reasonable objections, half the developers and businesses would have left. Bitcoin development would now be under the sole control of Mike Hearn, leading to fatal bugs within a year.
2) Censored XT in its entirety: nobody here would have even noticed anything. None of this would have happened, but we'd all be worse off for it.
3) Censor just the software: people would be well aware of the censorship, but every side would be on more equal ground to discuss their ideas. Few people would abandon Bitcoin if XT still succeeded, since it would have properly completed the concenus process. This is what Theymos went with.
Since this is such a charged debate, instead of arguing over what theymos should have done, let me ask you this: Say that you are the Ferguson Police Department just over one year ago. The crowd is already riled up, busses of people looking to loot have already arrived. How do you handle the situation? Do you:
1) Let the city burn (I was guilty of this, sorry).
2) Shoot the protestors. (Much like China)
3) Forcefully subdue the riot when it becomes violent. This will potentially injure bystanders and create animosity towards you. It will also be safe enough for news media to broadcast the whole thing live.
What would you do?
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:07:27


I agree. However, unlike the police, there is no way to appeal an issue in a way that an independent group can overrule the team that performed the action. As a tax-paying member of society, you have the ability to elect people who can do something about police misconduct, so you have some limited right to review body camera footage. That's not the case here. The only people who have any say over moderation decisions are Reddit and the mods. Every single one of those people have full access to the mod logs.
If Reddit decides that their ad-viewing customers should have some say as well, they can make that happen. That's up to them. But there is no link between Reddit and the mod team, so there is no incentive for them to be accountable to anyone other than because of altruism.
Long story short, if you want public mod logs, complain to Reddit. You actually have some power that way.

For the record, I've temporarily reverted that after it completed its trial run (which all new policies and AutoModerator rules have). I'm going to fix it to make it clear that a comment's parent comment was deleted.
The problem is that when people see a line of [deleted]'s as a child to the top comment, they automatically assume the worst. Honestly, I don't blame them. Without any visibility behind the scenes, that's exactly what it looks like. Unfortunately, that means that mods can't even safely remove *spam* that was a reply to the top comment without completely derailing the entire comments for that post.
If that worries you, turn CSS off and message me whenever you are concerned. I will happily provide the uncensored contents of the message upon request, unless doing so would violate the rules of Reddit (such as comments with personal information).
@_date: 2015-09-04 02:19:34


That is correct.


I know that this is Mike Hearn's position on it based on a conversation that I had with him earlier, so you're probably right about that in general.
Which is a shame, because we have tons of data on networks falling to 25% hash power in one difficulty period from the early altcoins. All someone needs to do is compile that information.

We aren't asking you to be silent, just to stick to the facts. The way you worded your post, it seems like you were purposefully trying to disband the foundation to further your own goals of personally controlling bitcoin (you couldn't even if you tried, but you seem to think that the Bitcoin Foundation does). They could have been under budget by just $100 and your post would have seemed just as valid. We call that "acting in bad faith".

A retrospective:

That post contributed no new information. In addition, it was mostly an advertisement for an altcoin. Finally, the Reddit admins deemed the site to be spam. While we don't give much weight to that, shadowbanned domains have a higher quality threshold to surpass to be approved since we treat those posts like an appeal (default action of delete) rather than a report (default action of approve).

This was almost certainly a lie to move things along. Since the funds aren't needed, the lender sees no reason to pursue investigating these funds. If they *were* needed, I assure you that they would have a different tone about the bitcoins.

Actually, if we applied the same logic, we wouldn't allow any client that included this feature to be promoted on this subreddit. Basically, we'd remove the announcement thread for the update and remove the link in the sidebar. That's pretty much it.
That being said, since this change doesn't change consensus rules such that it would have the potential to create two long-running simultaneous forks that are both called "bitcoin", none of that really matters. I'm willing to be convinced that this rule should be extended for other reasons, but I can't think of any way that the existing rules as they are would allow for removing such posts.

It certainly seems that it doesn't change existing functionality at a glance, but when you consider the UX it changes everything. Think about it, how would opting-into this be presented to the user? Probably a checkbox saying "Allow me to update this transaction to include higher fees if it gets stuck" or something like that. Great! So, I'll just check that for every transaction since I can't ever know ahead of time if it will get stuck.
Now, how does the merchant handle this? Do they tell their customer, "sorry, you checked a box that you shouldn't have, so now you'll have to wait about 10 minutes," or do they just accept it anyway to prevent the bad experience waiting would cause? If it's the latter, congrats, we just introduced full-RBF to the network, no opt-in required.
Before such a feature is added, the UX needs to be figured out. Otherwise, this is a solution in search of a problem.
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:24:02


Full-RBF doesn't change that. Once a transaction is announced, it is *impossible* to know if that one or a later one will ultimately be accepted. All it does is increase the odds that the later one will be accepted. However, the whole point of full-RBF is that zero-conf is a black and white issue, not something that exists on a spectrum, so I'm not sure how that would help here at all.

As long as you aren't promoting that we all start using boxes made with a box creation method that could start resulting in larger boxes before the community has come to a consensus to do so, you can say anything you want. Keep in mind, many box engineers still have concerns over this, as has helpfully mentioned:
As long as there is the potential that the change to the standard could result in two different standards in common use for boxes, the name of the new standard must be different to prevent confusion.

Because it is entirely possible that two active forks will result from BIP 101 activating.

First off, the top one (from your image) is a dupe of the older one on the bottom, so the top one (again, from your image) *should* have been deleted. Unfortunately, it appears that the moderation team failed to do that, I apologize.
...oh, wait, you think that we deleted it? If we did, you wouldn't have been able to see it on that screen since you weren't the one to post it (mod-deleted posts are only still shown in the listing to the person who posted it).
People probably downvoted it for being a dupe, which was the correct thing to do in my opinion. Not that my opinion matters much there since I only have one vote.

Because an issue has never really come up where there was disagreement among the mods about whether or not something has consensus. There has been disagreement about whether or not that matters, but not actually about whether consensus has been achieved.


Well, the mod team then, I guess. I figured that answering how that decision is made was more useful than talking about who makes that decision. What, were you expecting me to say that we would unconditionally follow the lead of Bitcoin-Core?


They could only do that if they keep finding legitimate issues that haven't been sufficiently addressed. We won't just say, "well, one person keeps saying the same bad things about this that have already been addressed, so there must not be consensus". The link in my previous comment goes into more detail about how we would likely get out of such a situation that you mentioned.
Additionally, what we decide here has nothing to do with bitcoin development. The only impact any decision we make will have is which "bitcoin" this subreddit is about. Trust me when I say that this subreddit isn't that important to most bitcoin users.


A huge majority of the American populous would like the U.S. government to give each of them $1 million, but that doesn't mean that doing so is smart.


Probably not, but many really smart people seem to have well-founded concerns that the "how" *might* be important. We should at least give some time to hear them out.


Minority and majority doesn't matter. What matters is that there are legitimate-looking concerns that haven't been addressed.


In my opinion, it's not. There appears to be sufficient consensus on that fact. There are still people who disagree, but that doesn't matter since their concerns have all been addressed in some way.
What still needs consensus is how to go about raising the limit.

I fully understand that you stated things in that manner in hopes that we would delete this post, but I don't think that such an important topic should be relegated to obscurity because people downvoted it for that reason. Therefore, to give this topic another chance, I am removing this specific post. Feel free to re-post this without the snark. I will personally approve it, if necessary.
@_date: 2015-10-14 02:21:10


Huh? How'd you come to form *that* impression? It is quite literally an insult to call someone a Blockstream employee, that's how negative the community is towards them. That needs to stop in general, since it should *never* be an insult to be working for any company in this subreddit, but that's besides the point.


Agreed. I'd like to hear more of your thoughts about that in a new post. You could probably mention how private sidechains like Liquid increase the barrier of entry for other exchanges, legal and illegal ones alike. You could liken it to the idea and importance of Network Neutrality. (hopefully you can already tell how unhappy I am about Liquid)


And my assertion is that if a company name becomes an insult, that's gone too far. Ad hominem attacks are not okay just because it involves a software company that you don't like.


Again, I'd appreciate a post about that, especially in light of Liquid being announced.
One final note: posts like your reply are completely acceptable. You back up your assertion with reason, and then explain why. Had you been banned and sent this to modmail as an appeal, I would have accepted it and unbanned you immediately.

Just to be clear, I believe that you are saying that XT clients will still relay low-fee transactions, so if the goal of this patch is to prevent low-fee transactions from getting into a block, it totally fails to do that?
If so, that is completely missing the point of why this patch does things the way it does.
By eliminating the lowest fee transactions from the memory pool when it runs out of space, you make it so that people still have a way of getting their transactions into your memory pool (by sending transactions with a higher fee than what is getting kicked out), BUT, unlike XT, this *keeps* the transactions that it has kicked out, out (until some time has passed with extra room in the memory pool).
At the individual node level, this doesn't matter all the much. However, when the number of nodes that do this rather than random kicking become a large chunk of the running nodes, this prevents an infinite relay loop.
You see, when you randomly kick transactions, it becomes possible to receive a transaction, relay it, drop it, receive it again, relay it again, drop it again, etc. in a never-ending loop.
The global mempool that you speak of is a game of hot potato where there are more potatoes than people. You can do it, since you can use the air (internet network lines) as a  temporary storage mechanism, but you're constantly throwing and catching the same potatoes.

Most notably, that was well after the October 2013 raid where they found files on Ulbricht's computer that proved that someone was leaking investigative information to him. If it weren't for Bitstamp and Venmo raising hell (which both caused independent investigations to start around the same time), this would have gone completely uninvestigated. In fact, I bet that if Venmo was the only one that complained, the case wouldn't have gone as far and as deep as it did. You could seriously argue that this investigation happened solely due to Bitstamp's report.
The existing regulations allowed the government to catch a crooked officer. Tell *that* to the regulators next time they say that the existing rules don't go far enough.

Not entirely the same. Chase has the ability to say "no" to any transaction you make, so technically *they* are the ones transporting currency between the countries.
If you store your bitcoin in, say, a Coinbase-controlled wallet (so not their multi-sig offering), that would then be the same thing as having Chase's app on your phone. If you hold the private keys or something that can access them, though, that is more of a grey area as far as the law is concerned.

Close, but not quite. You can't be paid to give any company any favors with your moderation tools that would affect the organic ordering and visibility of posts and comments. For example, you can't be paid either directly or indirectly to sticky an ad for a company, nor can you remove negative posts and comments about a company that you have a financial interest in.
Our moderation team is in the unique position where none of us trust anybody else (which is usually the same trait that got us into bitcoin), so we have the checks and balances in place to prevent this.

There was a great post about this the other day that describes something really similar to how the mod team would determine that:


Consensus is needed whenever someone using an old Bitcoin full node would permanently end up on a different fork than the client being promoted if that client was fully activated and used by enough of the hashing power that it could stay ahead of the old chain. Put simply, a hard fork.
We may also apply this to other types of forks if there is also major technical disagreement, but it's hard to say.


Neither did a situation that would call for such a rule.


Personally, I'd say keeping the limit is more controversial. However, personal opinions have nothing to do with moderation.

...which can only happen if those users are aware that a discussion even exists.

If mods had a "don't let this comment be hidden from users no matter what" button, we'd use that instead of deleting anything. Unfortunately, we don't have that.

This has been done very successfully in the past. However, there are two problems you will experience:
1) Proving that you can be trusted to hold the money.
2) Maintaining interest in the lottery. The very nature of bitcoin lotteries is that the barrier of entry is extremely low, so any success will result in hundreds of competitors cropping up overnight that will each take a smaller fee than you do. However, the very nature of lotteries in general is that you need large jackpots to remain interesting to players. You will find that this dynamic causes things to quickly break down and collapse the entire ecosystem.

If you were banned for discussing ideas, reply to the ban message or send us a new modmail if you can no longer find that message. We almost never review bans after-the-fact on our own, so you need to contact us if you would like to appeal. I, for one, review every appeal and regularly unban people. From what I see, bans that we end up reversing occur only about 1-2 times per week out of the 10-20 bans that typically occur in that time period. Even then, most of the successful appeals were because we gave the person the benefit of the doubt, not because the original ban was improper.
When I am looking at an appeal, I look for any redeeming factors in your recent comment/post history (I may go further back if the person disagrees with the assessment of their history that I send in my reply). You can be the biggest troll in the world, but if you contributed one new or useful piece of insight to a discussion recently, I will unban you. Many will say that this is too lenient. To them, I say that not doing that is censorship.
When a ban against you is successfully appealed, you tend not to get banned again anytime soon after that unless the unban was conditional to you changing sonething. Just look at for proof of that.

This is true in practice. However, if someone really wanted to, it is possible to prove that you were given the correct genesis block by comparing the amount of work preformed on every chain that people tell you about and seeing which one has the most absolute work, assuming that you are able to communicate with at least one honest node that knows The Truth. As mining becomes a larger industry, it also becomes easier to show that a minimum amount of time must have elapsed since a given block, based on physical limits. If that block also happens to contain a piece of information that you personally know could have only been known after a certain point in time, you also know the maximum amount of time that could have elapsed since a block was created. Using this information, you can make a fairly decent guess about whether or not you were told about the concenus chain *even if nobody tells you about the concenus chain*. This difference between the trust of PoS and PoW is very subtle, but it has major theoretical implications.
@_date: 2015-10-08 23:39:18


Yes, but then you need to have the bandwidth to receive it.
If almost every node used this patch, it would be possible to create an almost-infinite loop where everybody keeps downloading and uploading the same transactions repeatedly. Here's how it would happen.
1) a new transaction comes in.
2) you kick out a transaction and broadcast the new transaction since it is new
3) another node that had previously kicked out the transaction or never saw it gets it and broadcasts it.
4) repeat step 3 for a couple of hops.
5) during  the first node evicts that transaction.
6) the first node receives the transaction again. Return to 
This requires a massive number of transactions to pull off, but once you have that it is self-sustaining. The only thing preventing an attacker from doing that is the fact that XT nodes are mostly isolated from each other by Core nodes where other methods of blocking spam are being utilized.

It seems that you forget that an attacker could take advantage of this and create a persistent DDoS on the relay network. To emphasize what I am saying, I am saying that an attacker could create a bunch of transactions, shut down their computer, stick it in the microwave, watch it burn, then retire to an island in the middle of nowhere. Despite that, the Bitcoin network will continue DDoSing itself for weeks/months/years.
Sure, if you assume that there will be no attackers, XT's method is good enough. Unfortunately, attacks are inevitable. No amount of anti-fragility will prevent attackers from taking advantage of such a fundamentally flawed design.

I guess that you will have to do that, since they shut down a local bitcoins seller just this week.
Contrary to what you might think, these companies aren't going well above and beyond the letter of the law to impress the government. They're doing it because the banks that will work with them require it. Even with the extra due diligence, I can count on one hand the number of U.S. banks that will work with Bitcoin brokerages/exchanges. The banks, in turn, require this because of how overreaching the KYC/AML laws are. If you want this to change, contact your Congressman. Don't blame the Bitcoin companies. You should not have to know your customer's customer if they are a registered MSB, but that is exactly what the laws require. Take the banks' requirements out of the mix and things will be much more reasonable.

We rely pretty heavily on user reports to tell us when something is off-topic, so please report those posts!
Often, we will look to the comments to see if something is sufficiently off-topic. If the comments resemble what we would expect in another community more than what we would expect in that's a good sign that the post is off-topic.
If there are no or few comments, we will make an educated guess based on how the discussion of similar past topics tended to evolve over their time on the front page.
If a link doesn't mention bitcoin at all, but a great discussion over how the article applies to bitcoin starts in the comments, we'll probably leave it alone.

*That* is biased moderation. To purposefully not remove something so that it dies off is unfair. The decision *not* to remove something is often more powerful than removing that thing. A moderator must be consistent even if doing so would result in the opposite of what they want.

Honestly? I'd probably allow it if you aren't misleading people and aren't drowning out other conversations. Afterall, that's largely the reason behind most of the rules.
The first thing that I tell new mods in training is that this subreddit has no rules, only guidelines. If a comment or post significantly contributes to the conversation without misleading people or creating spam, it is acceptable no matter how many guidelines it breaks. For example, a post could use a link shortener and have a referral link and/or a bitcoin address in the post, but if it's otherwise a really great and useful post, we'll approve it. It'll probably be initially filtered for mod review by Reddit or AutoModerator, but we'll approve it when we get to it.
If Mike's comment had been transparent and upfront about XT containing a consensus change prior to or immediately after mentioning XT for the first time as a possible solution, I would have allowed it. I also would have overriden any removal by any mod other than theymos (which if he removed it, I would have still at least complained to him).
Hopefully that helps.

Removed this for violating rule number 3:


No explanation of how this is relevant to bitcoiners was provided, nor was one easily inferred.
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:21:07
I doubt that this was intentional.
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:14:37


Well, that depends on why he murdered that person. If you kill someone in self-defense, that is still technically murder in the same way that deleting a post is technically censorship.
@_date: 2015-10-12 14:41:34
That appears to have been moderator error. I have started a modmail discussion to address it, so hopefully this won't happen again when the suggestions are appropriate for the context.
Issues like this are regularly discovered and dealt with during the deletion review process, so don't read too much into this. Keep in mind that we have a bunch of new moderators, so mistakes sometimes happen.

What about the idea of transaction chain flattening, where the first unconfirmed transaction's outputs would be allowed to be substituted in a replacement transaction with the outputs from the transaction that one or more of the first transaction's outputs were used as inputs for?

As far as I know, all of those people were fully compensated by Coinbase. The only thing they lost was the opportunity to sell or otherwise use their bitcoin for a few hours.

Are you seriously worried that he removed *positive* news for ChangeTip? Those actions were no different than what any other mod would do.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:43:35
On the contrary, this thread proves that they did a stand up job of informing people. You can't claim that this thread got no publicity either, since it was on the front page of Reddit for most of yesterday. Despite all that, the number of complaints can be counted on two hands. That is an extremely good result for any election.
@_date: 2015-10-08 15:31:07


I fully acknowledge that. However, whether or not doing something would give that thing more attention should have no bearing on a moderation decision.
I would also like to point out that people were obviously interested in discussing general economic news,  politics and altcoins like Dogecoin in this subreddit as well. To say that we should allow something to be discussed here because people are interested in it is naive.
If you want to see things that other members of the subreddit are interested in, you should encourage Reddit to add a feature to the front page that will also show you posts from other subredddits that were upvoted by members of a subredddit you're interested in. Either that or just subscribe to related subredddits on your own.

There was in fact such a post here on Reddit. However, it didn't do very well:
@_date: 2015-03-26 00:31:03
It was done for a few reasons:
1) To make it harder to beg for bitcoins. By including a bitcoin address, you are essentially implying that your primary purpose of posting is to earn tips. By requiring everyone to use a tipbot, everyone is on equal footing and tips are more of a deliberate action taken by the tipper rather than something done out of pity. It's the same reason why you aren't allowed to say "Please upvote this post for visibility!".
2) It encourages giving to people who may not yet have a bitcoin address.
If you are posting about things like charities, it is perfectly acceptable to post their direct bitcoin address (if you provide proof that that is their actual address, of course).

I find it interesting how the votes for this comment and comment have changed as the Saturday morning crowd has left and the Saturday afternoon crowd has joined us. I wonder what the differences are between the two demographics.

No shit. This is how FBI agents were found to be corrupt in regards to the Silk Road investigation.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:39:11
I do realize that, yes. How this issue got publicity is besides the point. The fact of the matter is, despite this issue receiving the publicity you wanted the election itself to receive, not many complaints over the process were generated.
@_date: 2015-03-28 03:17:15
Not sure what you want me to do here. The email probably hit some suspicious words.
If you're suggesting that I remove this post, no. Circle, Coinbase, etc have posts like this here all the time. The security of major Bitcoin companies is very relevant.
By the way, it seems that you missed the memo that witchhunt target of the week is ChangeTip. =P

If Chase would let them open an account, I'm sure they'd want to do this! However, as it is, they are lucky to have a bank account in the US *at all*. Due to regulation, most banks aren't willing to risk fines and jail time if it turns out that their bitcoin customers are less than perfect in their compliance procedures.

Removed for brigading. Feel free to re-post the video (unless it was posted recently? I don't know...), but don't ask people to take part in the comments.

This is true, but I would also like to point out that it makes it significantly harder to *keep* control of the blockchain over the same period of real time for &lt;51% attackers, since more blocks over a time period means lower variance of the result after that time period.
It quickly becomes a matter of what we consider to be more important.
@_date: 2015-10-16 14:50:15


Not really, since that safety deposit box only exists in one location. If that location isn't on your person, then you aren't transporting its contents into a country.
So, how about debit cards? Well, you're still not transporting money. Your bank is the one doing the transporting at the time of use/withdrawal in the foreign country (although some countries count pre-paid cards as currency, anyway).
That being said, many countries don't consider bitcoin to be a currency, so it'd probably be treated under different rules.

Unless that spectrum is regulated, there's no way you're going to get very much range due to interference. In that case, you're just asking the government to give you, personally, free spectrum.

Do you know of any bots or software that we could use that would enable better transparency? Honestly, I would rather it being the case that people could see what we've deleted if they want to so that they can see the crap we deal with.

What, you mean the low-traffic/little used system that was specifically linked to in the third top-level comment of a front page Reddit thread? If few people complain even when the controversy over the election process is big news, I have trouble believing that there was a problem in the first place.
If you truly wanted to be elected, you should have been on top of this for yourself in addition to personally calling your supporters to remind them to activate. Compared to the get-out-the-vote campaigns I've seen and been a part of, a thousand people is nothing. This is politics 101 level stuff here.

This is a historic day. First we were told that we couldn't have a bitcoin: URI. [We did it]( [anyway]( After that, we were told that we would have to use an existing symbol for bitcoin. Not anymore.
This is a great accomplishment for the bitcoin community. Thank you to everyone who made this possible, whether you are a dev, a user who used this character in running text, or one of the people that helped out with this proposal. You made this possible.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:24:24
Well, TIL. I wish you the best of luck in this, since something like that would be awesome. Thanks!

Unless your timestamp is outside of the time range I mentioned and linked to, the only effect you can have is if you happen to solve a block right at one of the 2016-block difficulty adjustment points, you can make it seem like the time it took to solve 2016 blocks was an hour or so shorter or longer than it really was. This will usually balance out again after the next 2016-block period, so it's barely worth thinking about.

You aren't immune to this yourself. I'm giving you a three day ban to chill out.

Gee, this would have been nice to bring up *before* the election. Of course, in true tradition, that wouldn't have caused the desired drama. After all, we can now say that the Bitcoin Foundation is literally Hitler! It's hard to say that when you actually mention these things up front and people vote accordingly.
@_date: 2015-03-03 01:39:05


Possibly. You might want to talk to a lawyer about that one.


Note: I am not an accountant, tax advisor, or lawyer, so please take this with a grain of salt.
As long as you keep good records to show that you didn't sell or otherwise transfer ownership of those coins along the way, that should be able to survive an audit. Keep records from every point along the path. Specifically, you will need to be able to show the transfer to the tumbler, the transaction log on the shady website showing the tumbled coins arriving and later departing to LBC, and the LBC records showing their return. You DO NOT need to follow the coins on the block-chain beyond the link from the send to the receive by the service (what ever address(es) they gave you to send the bitcoins to). Keep in mind that most real-world transactions of fungible property don't have the hardcore traceability that bitcoin does. Because that is the norm in the world, you can consider each service to be its own black box with your money coming in and your money going out. Also, all of this only matters if you get audited. Unless you get audited, all that you need to report are your gains (purchase price, sales price, and the difference), if any, and the purchase date and sale date.

No, of course not. However, if 90% of your posts consist of ad hominem attacks, you're liable to being banned.
You cannot be banned for a single post in this subreddit unless you're new or you break a Reddit.com rule (such as doxing). We always review your other posts before taking any action.

In peer-to-peer networks, there is no such thing as a global time. There are only times that you consider to be reasonable from your point of view and those that you don't. In order to prevent problems, bitcoin is very lenient on the range of times that are acceptable. That means that sometimes later blocks will appear to come before earlier blocks, but that is just because different computers have different ideas of the current time.

If you want to write about the many ways that bitcoin can specifically solve this problem and decide to cite these weekly articles as evidence that the problem is real, I will be the first person to upvote you. However, none of these posts do that. Not even the comments mentioned bitcoin at the time of the removal. The COMMENTS of a thread posted in I'm not even setting the bar very high here, come on.

For the record, I knew that it was genuine concern all along, and would have treated it as such. That's why I'm not too concerned that this policy will lead to censorship.
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:11:10


Even better. This attack depends on transactions being dropped before they make their way back to you, so this is actually easier to pull off than I thought.
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:59:18
That post was fine, hence why it wasn't removed. It's his other posts that are the problem.
@_date: 2015-02-09 02:07:42
I reviewed both sides and determined that they were both intentionally trolling. It just so happened that I had a convenient reply to attach that to once I made the determination on so rather then editing my previous comment, I replied to his.
Now a bunch of trolls are trying to spin my actions.
Wanna know why we usually aren't this transparent? This is why. I would love to make posts like this more often to encourage more reports, but it seems that you guys prefer to believe that we do nothing. It's a real shame, too, because that line of thinking causes us to do much less than we could since fewer people report stuff, believing that we really *don't* do anything. Oh well.
@_date: 2015-10-18 06:35:28
If 99% of potential transactions have to be censored to avoid giving a single person the ability to censor 100% of potential transactions, then so be it.
There are security trade-offs in both directions: too few transactions and the network can be taken over, too many transactions and too few people can afford to handle the load.

I don't disagree. There are far more traditional methods of catching tax evaders that doesn't involve directly targeting Bitcoin. What they are trying to pull here is absolutely incredible, in the crazy kind of way.

If I felt that I actually understood enough of the Russian text using Google Translate, I would be happy to help out. However, Russian is just too hard of a language for the Global Moderation team to feel comfortable moderating in.
It sounds like we might need some more Russian mods.
Pinging @_date: 2016-07-25 15:20:31


Indeed. Just like if you asked people back in the day if they would rather have a faster horse than their current horse, they too would answer "yes". To claim that hearing that response should directly indicate the better course of action is a misnomer. Of course people claim that they want faster horses. They always will. But, that misses the point.
*WHY* do people want to increase the block size? That is what you should be asking. Answer that question and then you'll be on your way to a solution that the market will actually respond to, not just one that they say they will.
Do we actually need a larger blocksize? My guess is no. We just need to make transactions be fast and cheap. That is what people really want. How we get there is irrelevant.

He probably paid for the ad out of his own pocket. If the ad was paid for by the company, yes, that would be theft. If he used any of his special abilities that he only has because he works there, it is at least highly unethical.
This is all besides the fact that even the appearance of a conflict-of-interest may cause a PR issue for the company, so actions like this should be avoided even if there are no ethical issues.
@_date: 2016-07-30 00:40:25


It was terrible. People got so riled up about supposed mass-censorship that they started making informatory posts with the sole purpose of hoping that the post would get removed and/or that they would get banned. This was done with the justification that other people might be too afraid to speak out about it, so these people are just volunteering to be the victim on behalf of those who were afraid to speak up. Now with more proof in hand, even more people decided to do the exact same thing with the exact same justification. This just kept on going in a never-ending cycle.
Not once did anyone stop to consider that all of this ruckus was over fewer actual instances of censorship than I could count on one hand. All of which can be explained by poor judgment or human error, not intentional malice. All of which everyone in this subreddit still ended up reading about even if they only read this subreddit.
Trust me, I know this. I was a mod here and saw the mod logs and reviewed every action during this time period.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:59:36
Wasn't it because he didn't meet Voat's strict moderator activity standards? They're really insane: you are considered to be an inactive moderator if you fail to post at least one discussion or link per month in the subreddit plus at least one comment. This is regardless of your moderation activity or how often you log in. You can even be conversing with your own mod team *while they are secretly conspiring to remove you for "inactivity"* just minutes before the admins review the request and it doesn't matter.
Now, a person may think that those are reasonable activity requirements, but try to remember just how small Voat's community is. There's just not much to talk about there without talking to yourself.
Neither of the current mods there are considered to be active, so anyone can go ahead and claim /v/bitcoin if they want at this time.

Checkpoints would be considered to be a soft-fork. Any branch created prior to a checkpoint are considered to be invalid to clients that have the checkpoint, but not to clients that don't have the checkpoint. Even if that branch has a greater proof of work.
Obviously, it's pretty moot since a rollback that large would be rejected by the community, but they are still technically considered to be consensus rules.

Any time you find yourself regretting making purchases like this early on, just remember: you probably would have sold it for a slightly higher amount a few days or weeks later. Not anywhere near the current price.
It takes balls of steel to hold onto bitcoins when you've already made so much off of such a small investment.
