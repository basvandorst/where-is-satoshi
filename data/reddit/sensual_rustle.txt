Yeah no. This isn't an issue of "bitcoin isn't friendly to women" it is:
"women don't like being nerds. It's hard. It's icky"
Simple as that. This is present in everything of nerd/geek world. It isn't something that women typically care about. And the few that do, will show up anyways. 
This is kinda like saying "Why I run a group for men in cosmetology/nursing"
And let's be real. A lot of women don't like geek society because we typically value your knowledge of what the geek society is, more than who /what you are. 
/unpopular opinions. 
I wish you luck regardless. I just am under the opinion that it doesn't really address the problem that it is a thing for "geeks" or "nerds" .

Oh really now. Pray tell. Please.
@_date: 2015-06-05 17:23:29
Allllrighty then.....
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:46:40
You realize bitcoin core is only area where blockchain is actually developed and tested? Right? Everything is just a clone with different rules.

It will see another bubbly I think at least
@_date: 2017-08-17 13:58:41
Hi me. How am i doing? HODL'n stronk?
@_date: 2016-11-18 05:05:54
I've missed you, buddy :)

When a block is found by 2 miners at same time, one is propagated, the other is abandoned, or  "orphaned"
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:29:49
Either orphaned blocks, or transactions. The transactions could have been double spent, too. But does need clarification
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:09:08
Seems to work. Getting hits just going through here. nice find.
@_date: 2017-04-01 15:44:08
Congrats. Now we just have to get rid of the Lightning side chain crap. :D
I'm happy to see Gavin is still active.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:37:13
not much karma going on.
Sorry mate. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:21:56
Fuck it. I can't find the cross site scripting hack i read at the office. All I know is I saw 8 remote logins from various different countries on the account access history in my account.
I just expired all those active sessions. Not sure how they got access at all. 
Either that or my password was figured out on this account and I never got an alert of any login attempts.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:45:57
Sigh. I exposed the wallet because of this cross site attack. Laziness and complacency . Should not have put it on a shared storage service.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:46:41
Not sure what you mean. I knew where they were. Just someone else found them. They even took out the Bitcoin cash :(
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:56:53
 
Also found this
But further:
Multiple google results about mega.co.nz result in numerous other vulnerabilities similar. I just chose a bad remote storage service.
Don't forget the secret key is based on original used password here and once gotten, teh account is forever compromised.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:05:00
Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:54:55
thus why I posted. I'm a retard. Don't do me
Luckily this was mostly free money so I'm not heart broken. Just spirit broken 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:58:44
Speaking of a mega employee.
But it was not in a .wallet file on the site. It was in a tar.gz that was a gneric name with a 30char password. 
But the password wasn't purely random and something I knew by heart. So I assume it took a month to crack the passwords but once they were in they were in.
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:10:05
Passworded tar.gz file
The tar.gz was a generic name and the wallet inside was passworded. There was a passworded keepass file with the recovery key
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:44:14
Manual labourer. :S
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:54:19
I'm assuming. I've had some odd activities on a few email accounts recently and can only guess. Pure linux user with a windows successful login about 5 months ago? I changed most account passwords but might have missed something. Didn't think this could be related.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:49:17
Mega.co.nz paraded itself on launch about it's security. Turns out I didn't look into it since it was announced and just assumed.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:53:32
Gdamnit. Wrong link. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:48:27
I mean I did 1 initial no no which was using a memorized password. Second issue was I put it on a system I thought was secure but didn't verify before I did so
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:17:43
not my best thought. I figured it was only for  a short time and I will remove it off before it is on there too long.
Didn't even occur to me it was compromised from the get go.
I can't really express the dread.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:57:02
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:23:18
but seems to go back to the original article. Doesn't seem like I can find anything that will explain the access I've seen on my account.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:20:12
A "litmus test", if you would
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:38:44
Least I'm honest lol
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:08:17
unless the system gets compromised. If it is a storage wallet, print it. honestly that is what I should have done but figured what I did was 'good nuf'
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:16:26
Trusted a remote storage system I thought was secure, hadn't been keeping up with happenings and the accounts access history.
Got owned.
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:39:28
Yup. It's dumb. I have used wallets for over five years now, and I lost all my coin because of a cross-site scripting attack on my browser.
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:00:42
I really fucked up. 
And I can't do anything about it. 
Just going to claim it as a loss on taxes and move on with my life. start investing in it again fresh. never going to have that much value of something in my life again.
