Because as much as y'all pretend it's useful and simple, it isn't. But i sure do love making money off of it.

Thank you Cryptoholic, I'll take the advice to heart.

Get rich quick redditors will always throw out random years with random prices... They don't have some secret knowledge

No risk, no roof.

It's because the price is all speculation and anything can cause it to go up or down
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:30:32
Lol fuck you

I tried imagining it, but i could only see Bitcoin.

So not profitable, got it

What is there to wonder? A large sell order was completed
@_date: 2017-06-07 20:05:51
I would kill to have that interest rate on my bank account

Who are you trying to convince?
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:06:15
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:27:17
Why would you ask that here and expect a reasonable answer?

"Bitcoiners actually believe this"

Huge red flags for what is a scam
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:42:25
They could just make one transaction and have it all disappear
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:24:45

Good joke, good joke

Why would you ever think that
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:36:21
They said the same thing in 2013
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:52:07
To further convince people here that "this can be you too!", Except for the part where you are 4 years too late
@_date: 2017-06-10 03:52:04
Do not listen to this subreddit for advice on this stuff, like all subreddits this is an echo chamber for a specific topic. People have a vested interest in you backing the same coin they are backing.
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:29:46
Yeah good luck with that bud
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:38:03
Haha fees are good
