2nd best part is the leader board:
    Address	Bets	Wins	Losses	BTC Bet	BTC Winnings
    15HJgk	1467	379	1088	82,129.28450000	7,729.95349641
    1EP4rM	3962	968	2994	256,924.43131000	6,760.43272121
    17sjYP	433	135	298	35,926.68180000	4,750.57501594   
    14wQQy	6911	3749	3162	29,155.60150000	1,581.77389717
Looks like the leader has lost about $75 million USD.  The 2nd place person has lost $250 million USD.  Scam fail.

Right, but if the banks cannot process transfers with the exchanges, what does that leave you?  In-person exchanges?
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:14:27
No idea.  That screen popped up when I was signing up.  I did a little more research and opened an account with CoinBase.  I need the account to accept some coins.

The only way to get the code is to install Authy. (which is fine)

Albert is the Nigerian Prince of Bitcoin.

My bank would never allow this.  They would be challenged with security questions due to an unknown IP address.

I agree that in a vacuum, eventually this would play out the way you describe.  *But*, in the same vacuum,  if demand for natural gas goes down, so does the price of natural gas.  No?

I just signed up with CoinBase to accept some coins.  Would you suggest a different exchange for a US person?
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:29:53
That's what I thought I was doing.  They just sent me an SMS with a link to the app.  I have no problem with using the app for 2fa, just that it needs access to be my location and camera.

To be clear, you give your bank username and password to trusted sites?  Never, in my life, have I heard of this.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:32:57
It seems the stories coming out today are saying just that.  Banks cannot send your money to exchanges.

The verification you are talking about is what I'm doing right now.  There is another verification where you give up your credentials; that is what we were discussing.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:51:00
Thanks.  I'm going through the bank verification on CoinBase right now.  I wonder if anybody is actually crazy enough to give them their bank credentials and allow a CoinBase employee to log in and verify the account.  I'm waiting for the micro-deposits/withdrawal.  Also, seems a little ridiculous that the app required for phone verification, Authy, needs access to my phones location and camera.  Oh well.

Same requirements for Second Market.

My coworkers bought it at $3 a few years ago.  I was too suspicious.  They bought 100 coins each.  They got excited when it hit 30 and sold most of it.  A couple of them have a few coins left.  I bought in waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy late.

If I read this correctly, you *cannot* exchange (buy or sell) Bitcoin for Chinese currency.  You *can* exchange Bitcoin for goods and services, i.e. barter.
This is good news if you look at Bitcoin as the future of digital currency.  This is uncertain news if you are an investor.  This is bad news if you are a speculator.  
In my own personal experience, the people I know buying Bitcoin are mostly investors and a few speculators.  They don't necessarily care as much about buying a car with Bitcoin as they do in hoping to get in early and see it hit 100k.
What's interesting in all of this is that I think China and Japan are the perfect cultures to really push Bitcoin for barter and thus standardize it as stable, global currency.  People in the West are just too quick to dream of winning the Bitcoin lottery.  No offense to all the people in the West doing really great work for the future of Bitcoin; I just don't know too many of you :)

Got it.

Yes, however, Albert has named me his secretary, you can just send me the $50k.
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:31:21
That's a pretty expensive project.
