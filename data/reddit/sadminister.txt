Im not asking when it will confirm. My balance was .74867 when i imported the paper wallet in electrum. I only sent the .58 to another address. My question is what happens to the remaining coins. Are they in my electrum wallet or did i do something improperly and they are now lost?

Never purchased bcash, this is the transaction id that is shown on my electrum wallet. from a BITCOIN paper wallet

Thank you so much for taking the time to help me out. I can see what you mean when i look at it it on blockchain.info myself. Tbh i was reading about importing paper wallets and change addresses and i got really confused. Probably should have just slowed down and tried to figure it out but i completely panicked, thank you for your help! Merry Christmas!

i have a 13 word seed and the passphrase is clearly written off to the side. When i type in the seed the next button goes gray and i am unable to click next.

My first wallet was a mycelium wallet and as far as ease of use goes i dont think you will have a problem. They do have ads on the app now so that is annoying but not a total deal breaker. You also have the option to pick a lower transaction fee so thats nice since most wallets dont offer that. However, im pretty sure they are not segwit compatible so be warned. Im no expert but i recommend making a paper wallet using bitcoinpaperwallet.com

Before you go "investing" it is important to do your own research. Bitcoin was created admist one of the biggest market crashes and bailouts in U.S History. It aims to solve many of the current problems that plague our banks and financial sectors. I believe it a superior alternative for storing and exchanging value. I see it as a hedge against the dollar which is an endlessly printed fiat currency that hasnt been backed by silver or gold since the 70s. Bitcoin is a transparent, decentralized, deflationary, form of currency that allows people to freely transact without massive fees and corporate supervision. Bitcoin sitting in a paper wallet is safer than money stored in the bank. The invention of the blockchain is one of the greatest inventions of our lifetime and its use case can change voting and countless other systems for the better. Dont let the price of bitcoin blind you from its real value.
