If someone’s been here for 4 years, you can probably assume they’re not completely ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:01:50
You’re kidding right. 15K was the obvious short term limit. You can’t really predict it.

He’s definitely relevant in the story of Bitcoin and it’s creator.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:12:01
It means you thought I should know something.
And I’m sorry. It doesn’t say you’re subbed to those but it’s number 2 on the subs that you’re active in. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:42:28
Okay smart guy.


You clearly meant this as an insult, implying someone who’s been here 7 years should know better. That kind of proves my point. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:52:53
Of course it’s not him. He’s still relevant. He was the biggest red herring we’ve had yet. Magazines and newspapers declared him Satoshi during one of the largest surges to date, only for him to turn out to simply be a charming old dude who wanted a sandwich. 
Im not saying you need to know who he is to buy bitcoin but if you have followed its “story” for more than a year, you’d probably know of him because it’s interesting. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:32:50
You didn’t have to explain it buddy. It was obvious and doesn’t contradict what I said at all.

@_date: 2018-01-16 17:54:00


You really don’t get that you saying I should know after seven years proves my point that people who’ve been here longer should know more?
I never said anything could be gleaned from 1 day old accounts. I agree.
And I acknowledge that people can stay idiots forever.
But to get back to the original point, it’d surprise me if someone in this sub who had flair showing they’d been here for 4 years was freaking out about a 10% drop like some do. That’s it. 
If you still don’t get it, I don’t know how to help. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:02:12
You said he isn’t relevant. I said he was to bitcoin’s story.

On an anonymous forum, one of the only indicators you have about other people is the amount of time they’ve been there.

@_date: 2019-07-21 00:43:40
It being digital means everything here though. She’s not asking for him to regift her a bunch of money with interest. She’s asking if there’s anything that can be done about what she lost.
Him lying to her about it is spiteful and petty.
In the original thread, he even said he’d give it to her children someday, which he meant like he’s great because he isn’t keeping it for himself but to me came off as “she had her chance, and she didn’t like my present, so I’m done with her.” Doesn’t sound like someone I’d want to spend much time with.

I have a friend who owed me $900. He paid off $300 a while back but it’s been a while. His wife lost her job recently and they have a 3 year old so I haven’t been pushy about it. The other day he told me he was taking his family to New York for a splurge weekend trip, which set off an alarm but, whatever. People should take vacations. 
An hour later he brought bitcoin up and I made the mistake of saying I had “some”. Immediate response was “then why should I owe you money?”
That’s when I had to say “I haven’t gone on vacation in 2 years. Give me my money.”
EDIT: just out of curiosity, how much do you think one would have to have in the bank to drop a $600 debt to a good friend?

Well, if that was all I knew about him I’d say the same thing. But the whole truth is he’s been there for me and a lot of his friends in hard times (helping with money, time, a good meal, etc when needed). He can be a dick but he’s been a good friend for ten years.

I don't like paying taxes either but If you rent an apartment, do you complain about the landlord taking your money?
But you'll choose to live in a country that requires you to pay taxes, then act like they're stealing money from you. 
EDIT: I'm a libertarian. I just think "they're stealin' my money"  is an oversimplification that hurts your argument.

We're getting off topic but to answer your question, let me tell you why a smart consumer might own an iphone.
I got my first in 2008 when it was by far the best functioning phone (for my needs). In 2010 when my contract was up, there were competitors but apple's app selection was far better. In 2012, I thought about jumping ship but now I have all these apps and honestly at that point in my life, I didn't want to spend a month researching and getting acclimated to a new interface.
Next time I'll probably move on :/
For the record, I've always built my own PCs. I have about 8 with 4 different OS's. I usually use macs at work (designer) and I think it's ridiculous that most of my coworkers think that designers HAVE to use macs.

Is it really free to trade? How do they make their money?
EDIT: I got three different answers and from my own research, it looks like they're all wrong.
1 .They don't charge a higher rate. Their rate fluctuates. Though it does seem to be higher more often.
2. They don't charge a baked in fee. They sell at the same price they buy.
3. They don't charge an awful rate. Even if you want to see the higher price as a fee, it's about 0.5%, or half as much as Coinbase.
I can guess that they make money off people buying through them, and using it, rather than hoarding it, but that still doesn't seem right

That's a great suggestion. But may I add to it? I feel like a greater win would be to be genuinely polite. People can often sense when you're trying to "high road" them. You may risk coming off as sarcastic, arrogant, or condescending.
If you can look past someone else's temper or ignorance and respect them regardless, it's better for YOU and you'll be a lot closer to turning their opinion when they see genuine respect.
That's how I see it but you may be right too.

I think there’s info in the sidebar about bitcoin. The technology, history etc. 
If you’re looking to buy, Coinbase or the Cash app are okay places to start because they’re user-friendly. I’m sure others will suggest “better” places for different reasons but they’re easy and established.

I just had a coworker ask me about the “huge drop”. I checked the price and was like “it’s higher than it was yesterday”.
Also I don’t make a lot of price predictions but it seemed pretty likely that there’d be a lot of people out there that promised themselves they’d “hold till 10,000”
I think it’ll jump up and down this week and then steady out and then a whole new batch of people that just caught wind of it will start trying it out.

Maybe “talk shit” is bad phrasing. Different cultures definitely show love different ways. But in my world, a little bit of guff is essential to friendship.

Also, Americans understand metric and use it every day. I've never heard an American argue against metric. It's more a matter of how and when to switch. Some industries (including my own) are entirely metric. NASA produced a report a while back that a switch would cost them $400M.
