Was just replying to a post elsewhere and realised something which might cause a problem for btcbuilder - for at least a week after it started unverified accounts could transfer goxbtc and sell them (I thought about doing it). Now its looking like MtGox are analysing their transaction history for fraudulent accounts which will get eliminated from any refund.
What I can't remember is whether the bitcoinbuilder site required verification from the start.

I've had an IG account for years, in many ways they are more like a bookmakers/gambling firm than a financial one. Dont know about the US but in the UK we arent taxed on gambling winnings (the company offering the bet pays taxes on its profits), so this can be a tax free way of speculating on the markets.
Having just said that, I know IG will hedge most of their financial bets on the actual live markets, so its entirely possible they would do the same with bitcoin if the volume was sufficient.

With the timing its possible that Gox tried to move a large bunch of coins out of their cold storage and something went wrong, which might explain the extended "working on the problem".
Or someone was able to steal the coins from the cold storage, but of course if it was proper cold storage that shldnt be possible.

Yes, recently its been looking too much like bitcoin theft is the perfect crime - hack an exchange or wallet, steal a bunch of btc, tumble them a bit then convert to fiat. 
Much fuss and hand-wringing in the bitcoin community but no police investigation. No regulation doesnt mean no laws apply, it sometimes seems like the attitude is that all the responsibility is on bitcoin owners to secure their holding, and having btc stolen is a tax on stupidity.

10 PH/s added in two weeks? I havent been keeping up with ASIC design but I guess that means a fab somewhere has been churning out a new chip. Give it few more months and sites like cex.io will have to use TH/s as their basic measurement.
It worries me a bit that there is now so much money invested in the mining infrastructure it becomes a liability - say a theoretical new weakness in the SHA256 algorithm was discovered then there would be a lot of resistance to hardforking the blockchain onto a new algorithm.

I believe its more of a circular flow, as long as more fiat comes into the system (i.e. the demand for btc is higher than the supply) then the price per btc will rise. You're right that the demand has to keep increasing with the rise, otherwise the price per btc will fall until it comes into equilibrium again.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:42:57
Yep, I read it as you get your balance in the new goxcoin, that would then just be tradeable like any other altcoin/btc pair. Except most of its "value" would come from peoples' perception of the likelihood of Gox refunding any btc/fiat eventually. Not unlike BitcoinBuilder.
It would be another mechanism for doing the "new user-owned Gox exchange" idea as before, but the advantage of using an altcoin is that users can withdraw it to their own cold storage. It would be nice to think that an NFP-GOX could recover balances through trading fees as well, but I fear that might be too much of a challenge as you'd need to build a completely new exchange platform. The only value you'd potentially transfer from the old Gox would be the verified user account base, and how many of those have already migrated to other exchanges?
@_date: 2014-03-15 23:00:00
You could point to several altcoins as "proof" of how mining can suck the value out of a cryptocurrency, and its a potential problem as long as the miners are converting their income into a fiat currency. However as long as the flow of fiat into the cryptocurrency from investors and new adopters is greater than that taken out by miners then it provides good flow of liquidity.

The Full Tilt Poker shutdown is an interesting comparison, for more reasons than the OP might think. For those who dont know, FTP was closed by US Gov without warning for basically "executive fraud" - those running the company were happily paying themselves whatever they felt like and not ensuring the players' balances were maintained separately. Figures quoted along the lines of $1billion in player deposits, over $400million paid out to FTP directors, all since the site started, and when the site was frozen players were owed around $350million. Accusations of a classic "Ponzi Scheme" because they had to keep players coming in to pay off those cashing out.
However since then, without admission of guilt, PokerStars has taken over FTP and paid $731million to settle the case, which includes $550million to reimburse players.
So yes, some highly dodgy accountancy practices, but the rest is open to debate.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:55:51
Yep, they're just trading goxbtc that were transferred whilst the site was online. I would have done it myself, except Gox decided to require verification for all btc movements sometime around Feb 11th so I was completely trapped. (My account dates from 2011 when you didnt have to be verified at all, and up until the problems could still withdraw btc)

Yes, I expect more grief in my recovery process, if there is anything to recover, but at least I should be able to prove my account is legitimate eventually. It was just the statement about issuing 1:1 for "verified balances" - starts getting complicated.
Interestingly there is no guarantee that all the goxbtc on bitcoinbuilder are legit either, for at least the first week it was running I could have transferred my unverified coins to it. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:16:15
Balance is correct for me, did a last trade 15min before Gox closed permanently and noted the balances, so the data is current. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:33:05
I dont think any of it is clear with Gox as usual, for the last few months that I can remember it said all over the withdrawals page "all withdrawals require a verified account", but in fact they didnt if your account was old enough.
Hopefully for Josh @ bitcoinbuilder he hasnt got a bunch of dodgy goxbtc in his account but who knows what happened at Gox.

Most of my questions are already covered, but one to add:
Can we request that the Japanese court appoint a bitcoin dev/expert to assist their existing supervisor, or otherwise validate the suitability of their current appointee to deal with this specialist subject?
Fwiw, I wouldnt in principle object to Gox being reincarnated as a community run exchange, but I've yet to see a plan which accounts for any setup and running costs. If it would require a significant proportion of any remaining Gox funds then its probably not feasible.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:42:54
Technically Gox is an exchange not a bank - banks suffer from runs because they loan out much of the deposited capital and therefore dont have the funds available to satisfy all their creditors at short notice.
Of course that still assumes that Gox havent been somehow "investing" customers' btc...
@_date: 2014-02-24 02:37:46
The only reason I've seen given for the increase in Gox's price yesterday was that traders were inspired by the ["light on the horizon"]( post, which does seem to correlate timing wise.
Having said that, in the following hours there were several posts, including from G.Maxwell (core Bitcoin developer), pointing out that the light was a false dawn but the price didnt drop back to previous lows.
I'm not sure that the general "mood" of the subreddit affects the price, but convincing rumours can do, particularly in a lack of genuine verifiable information situation like the current Gox affair.
You might find  interesting, actually tracks the "mood" of the subreddit.

Quite a lot of alt-coins now have variable block rewards, either on a "random" range for a luck element or just a decreasing scale to reward early adopter miners. Usual way for them to do a premine is a much higher reward for the first set of blocks, then when the coin is launched and the code released those blocks have already been mined by the developers and are on the new blockchain.
I say "random" because Dogecoin had to risk a hard fork recently and change their source code because some miners had figured out how to anticipate the variable reward per block and were only mining when the reward was likely to be higher, which isn't a good thing for various reasons :)

Irrespective of who is actually guilty of doing what at this point, this seems to be another incident of funds being stolen. The usual people appear saying "see, regulation is required!", and others saying "regulation wont help!".
The problem I have is that there are existing laws which apply to these situations, as far as I am aware theft is illegal throughout the world and I doubt many people would argue against that. The trouble is the scammers and crypto-thieves see themselves as immune from prosecution because noone gets prosecuted.
Of course if you add "drugs" into the mix then they will stretch existing laws as far as possible to prosecute the likes of DPR and Charlie Shrem. In comparison, the guys at Bitcomsec have a pile of evidence which makes a very convincing case to show that one person stole over 1k BTC from Cryptorush, yet Interpol etc arent interested in even looking at it.
If any criminal charges arise from this whole Moolah/Mintpal thing, I'm pretty certain they won't have anything to do with theft or fraud. Rather than campaign for or against new regulations I'd like to see existing ones applied first.

You can sign up with the Olivier &amp; co class action at mtgoxrecovery.com - currently it has a reported 250k BTC of Gox clients registered. And unlike several other US &amp; UK lawyers touting their "class actions" you're not asked to pay anything upfront to join.
I'm registered with them and so far it looks like a great job is being done - check the updates on the blog for details.

Bitcoin mining is an arms race, so miners have to keep purchasing the latest hardware to stay profitable. You'd think that hardware manufacturers who gained a reputation for shipping hardware late so it was becoming obsolete because they mined with it for 3 months first wouldn't keep getting new orders. Unfortunately the rapid increase in the price of btc has distorted the market so much that nothing seems predictable any more.
Its probably the reason more companies are offering "cloud hashing" these days - instead of purchasing the hardware and maintaining it yourself you just buy "GH/s" from someone else's mining setup. Those deals have never looked like good value to me, but are at least much more quantifiable than "$3k to buy a miner I may receive in 1-3 months, which may return x btc/day when I turn it on, and x is pretty much guaranteed to decrease rapidly whatever".
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:00:40
I saw that, (see [my post here]( if you want the rest of the analysis). Its not actually failed transactions, Gox pushed all their transactions to Eligius - the variable is called "freetxn" which would be a bit of a giveaway possibly

Go and look up nullc if necessary, but if he says "that's no proof that the address you are talking about belongs to Gox" then its hard not believe him.
Unfortunate, because I like the theory that Mark has done something bizarre with some private cold storage wallet keys (time locked storage vault?), and I really hope its true, but I wldnt bet more btc on it.

I can't remember exactly, but it was something calculable - there was post in a cpl of weeks ago explaining it with an example script you could use to switch your miner in and out of doge mining.

Does such a thing exist with fiat tho? I know there is plenty of regulation when it comes to things like the minimum reserves banks have to maintain, but is there anything which says the likes of Paypal have to achieve some form of security standard for their Internet presence? (This is an honest question btw, I don't know whether there is or not).
Gox is an interesting example, we wait to see how much of the money disappeared due to incompetent management and how much was down to theft. If it was incompetence then there are parallels with the 2008 banking crisis - regulation didnt help any consumers there, just governments bailouts. If it was theft then usually these cases dont appear to be too challenging for law enforcement to solve - the blockchain and server logs provide all the evidence, but there isnt the international co-operation or inclination to prosecute.
Anyway, put the debate about regulation to one side for now, my point is that there should be much more effort put into prosecuting these criminals.
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:49:23
My viewpoint is probably skewed from being involved in technology for so long, my "short term" means 1-2yrs max, mid term 2-5yrs and long term would be anything beyond that. I know that in the normal financial world you'd probably look at long term being at least 10 years.
Bitcoin has been going for over 4 years now so its not in a short term experimental phase any more, but then that doesnt mean I'd recommend it as a long term investment either. Pedantic semantics :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 02:15:25
If you've been following the forums closely then yes you may have withdrawn from Gox a longtime ago. If you decided a while back that you didnt have time to trawl through posts everyday figuring out what's real and what's not then you might well base your conclusions on:
* Gox are the longest running exchange around, if they were dodgy they would have gone in 2011
* Gox CEO is founder member of Bitcoin Foundation, no doubt its in their interest to make sure its ok
* Keeping coins in your own wallet should be safest, but look at all these people who have lost them to malware, corrupted backups, etc
Personally I lost coins on gox; I had one of my occasional due diligence moments at the start of Feb and decided to move them out, then I discovered the problems for myself. The previous diligence moment was before Christmas and everyone was still ectastic about the price rise and surviving Silk Road
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:02:20
Is it possible that Gox think they have identified one or more of the thieves?
Cryptocoins in general could do with seeing someone prosecuted for theft, currently it looks like a no risk / high reward crime. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 01:58:33
I think you have to look at pretty much all the cryptocurrencies apart from btc/ltc as being in a short term experimental phase.
Pretty much all of them are vulnerable to hash-rate based attacks, but the risk is limited by the lack of liquidity in most of these markets - look at the buy market depths on Cryptsy and you'll see that most of them have less than 10btc total order sum. Makes the potential profit from an attack a lot less attractive.
Its something of a Darwinian process though, the short lifespan of altcoins flourishing and then being overtaken by more successful versions of themselves leads to a rapid evolution. In three years time I'd be surprised if more than 5 altcoins still exist but they will have absorbed the best features of their predecessors.
OP's last paragraph is a good summary of where altcoin development has got to so far, these are all features that were launched by one coin and are being refined by new ones.
We may well end up with several coins optimised for different uses - small transactions/rapid confirmation, secure saving, market specific, etc. Some of the existing coins might be saved by merged mining with new ones but most will die as their value is transferred into new coins. 
What I really dont like is the altcoins with "pre-mines", always a risk of a scam which sucks value out of the alt-coin economy. Most of the money going into altcoins is highly speculative (some people might actually believe that EarthCoin will save the world ;) ), but it is funding what is effectively real world cryptocurrency research.

"Verified customers" gives me a problem, my account dates from 2011 when I didnt need verification, and I made all my fiat deposits before then. I didnt submit to verification after that because there was no need.
I wouldnt object to a need for verification to legitimise my claim to my funds in Gox, but I would object to any process that devalues my claim because I wasn't Gox verified. How would you handle that?

Completely pointless comment this as I'm sure nobody at Gox will read it, but if the call centre staff have no information to provide why dont they sum it up at the start of the hold music and give you the option to stay in the queue if you really want a human to tell you the same thing?

Interesting point though, in the (highly unlikely) event that Gox did eventually pay back 90%+ of outstanding balances, and yet the Goxcoin exchange trading fees had already contributed to 20% of thoses balances, would ex-Gox customers be 10% better off or would it be claimed back by the new exchange?

I'm not entirely sure about that, seems accounts had a different verification status according to when they were created, the post says he tried it 21 days ago and I wasnt getting "must be verified" messages that long ago, but was a week later. I also had a max daily withdrawal limit of 400btc, which I believe was higher than newer accounts.

Since MtGox turned on their auto login emails there's been a flurry of "my account hacked" posts, but dont think I have seen any where btc have gone missing. Makes me think these accounts were all compromised a while back and someone has a bot hoping for btc to appear in them.

I was able to submit BTC withdrawals on Gox until they halted them completely, and my account is definitely unverified. But I have had the account since 2011, when you only had to be verified to actually withdraw fiat, iirc.
