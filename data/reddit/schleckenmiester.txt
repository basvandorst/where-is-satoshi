Well then, thanks for the warning! What other debit would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:23:20
I didn't say it will, I said it could.

Should have called it Stark Industries. Next thing you know the Marvel Universe comes to life in a couple of years.

I prefer Bcash over Bitcoin at the moment, but Roger is such an asshat. I wish we had a different face of Bcash.

Yes, Bitcoin adoption was quite stagnant in 1993.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:25:08
I don't think Bitcoin will ever crash too much to not be absorbed and brought back up. Bitcoin has made a name for being worth a lot of money. If people hear that it's all of a sudden really cheap, they'll just buy it again, making the price go up.

Why don't we increase the block limit to decrease transaction fees?

What do you guys think of [this video?](

I just use Quick BT. Quick and banks doesn't seem to mind.
@_date: 2018-04-11 05:59:00
Do you think Credit Unions are any better than banks?

Oh hi mark.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:20:08
I think it's leading to that, but I don't think Bitcoin *is* that. Therefore, HODL.
@_date: 2018-04-27 06:30:04
And those are? Why don't we just do both?
