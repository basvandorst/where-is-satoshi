You’re reading the words of the real genius. I bought in mid Jan — all time highs all over. 
The dip was fine for me too. This current one? This is fine. My portfolio has lost 50% and I cAnt “buy the dip” unless I sell blood/semen

I really need to wrap this up here. We are talking past each other. It is hard to converse with someone who has already discredited an article they haven't read as a "shit piece" and continuously confuses the meaning of words.
The headline may give you the wrong impression. The point of the piece is to draw the juxtaposition of what FUD **used** to be i.e. an intentional disinformation strategy to what FUD **is becoming** i.e. any and all information, true or otherwise, that we don't like.
The headline doesn't encapsulate the whole piece, headlines rarely do, and as we can see from your responses, confusion is what results when we think this is what they do and we don't take the time to read the content. It is simply hinting at the contents of the piece which is trying to say that facts/thoughts/ideas/questions, just because you don't like them, do not **necessarily** meet the requirement of what FUD **traditionally** has been. 
Not as catchy a title, I know.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:46:30

@_date: 2018-03-05 03:15:47
We are largely saying the same thing RE what FUD can be. I don’t claim FUD can’t be based in truth. Again, read the blog. The point I was trying to make is that IF fear, uncertainty or doubt is your response to stimulus, that doesn’t mean the stimulus is incorrect. Which you seem to agree with. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:23:35
Well this was hands down the best read posted to crypto-related subreddits in about 4 weeks. 
I appreciate your work and write up. The ‘There Will Be Blood’ GIFS were perfect. 
More people should read this. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:09:30
Patronising, egotistical, self-absorbed garbage. The first paragraph alone has two references to your own genius and the comparison with bitcoin to cancer. 
Definition of hubris and hyperbole. 
There are so many errors in both grammar and content here that it’s insulting to waste people’s time asking them to read your uneducated illiterate bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:58:42
Thanks for the reply.  And your educated advice. 
However I don’t think you read the piece. 
Wikipedia: Fear, uncertainty and doubt (often shortened to FUD) is a **disinformation strategy** used in sales, marketing, public relations, talk radio, politics, religious organizations, and propaganda. FUD is generally a strategy to influence perception by disseminating negative and **dubious** or **false** information and a manifestation of the appeal to fear.
FUD traditionally refers to something with the **intention** of deceit. While In the crypto world it is quickly becoming an umbrella term for anything we don’t want to hear. 
The point of the piece is to elucidate this nuance. 
Before responding, perhaps actually reading the blog would be helpful?
Regardless, thanks for making my point.

The value of tomorrow’s euro is not guaranteed, whether it is backed by banks or not. 
The real question is one of value. People are beginning to value centralised controlled currencies backed by material like gold less and less.
Does bitcoin offer something of value? Of course it does: a decentralised trustless means of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 02:15:56
Correct. Nor should they immediately be dismissed as FUD.
