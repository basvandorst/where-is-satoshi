Maybe time will come Bitfinex can explain their side with the digital world on what's all about this tethers issue.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:51:39
so reading this thread here. they are telling me that tethers is a scam and it is associated with bitfinex.I wonder why tethers still in the market today and bitfinex continue getting its own audience of traders and they even have a higher requirements right now like You need 10,000$ to in their platforms

Maybe trading in this world is not safe if you are a gullible person.better put your money in the banks if you don't want to risk it. I think very one here has many opinions as what happening in the market,but only one thing is sure, business as usual for the traders

I think we need to have a data on the actual fund OF biTfineX AS FAR as we are concerned as to make sure it is .

True , The real reason is the subpoena issue last (December 6, 2017) and FUD'lers still spreading this news, but i think this time this news is going to dump because people got sicked seeing this issue for a whole month. and they're moving on now.
