How is that outrageous? I don't see a significant uptick in 2008.  Note that it increasing exponentially by design.

bitcoin is a currency, just a shitty one.  There is no way that the blockchain can handle even a fraction of the velocity of the dollar.  Ethereum does a better job, but has its own issues with security.  I still own both but treat the money invested as a loss

They wouldn't be as rich as they are if they just sat on hoards of cash.  Net worth is not their bank account balance.

while this chart is scary, it just gives the FED another tool to control the money supply.

People want to pay more for something that does well and vice-versa.  I'd put more money into bitcoin if something like trading volume was increasing as well.

I have a small position in Bitcoin because it'd be dumb not to.  However, blockchain technology puts a cap on trading volume so I have to wonder how it'll handle volume required for everyday payments like those processed at visa.

No, you buy those because you expect the company to grow
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:41:12
The price is directly correlated with the performance of the company.  You literally own part of the company.

Yes, the notes were redeemable at the time, but the case is still successfully used to defend fiat currency.
It states:


-Juilliard v. Greenman as cited in Milam v. United states.
Milam wanted to redeem his fiat for gold or silver, but the case was promptly dismissed using this Juilliard v. Greenman as evidence.
This supreme court decision gives congress the unquestionable authority to enforce Federal Reserve notes as legal tender.  31 U.S.C Section 5103 is the most modern piece of legislation that executes this power.
As far as demanding a high price in dollars is concerned, yes you could do that, but why would you want to?  Dollars have a higher utility than gold or silver because they are legal tender of the United States.

they're speaking about cash.  They have to accept the dollar as payment though.   This means that they can chose to only accept credit cards and whatnot.

Its almost like something else caused the inflation?

Where does that say only creditors?

Juilliard v. Greenman
Way back in 1884, the Supreme court ruled that Congress has the constitutional authority to decide what is and isn't legal tender.  Juilliard wanted to be paid in silver coins, and Greenman wanted to pay in dollars.  The court forced Juilliard to accept the cash.
It is important to note that both parties agreeing to payment using some other currency or store of value is fine.  However, unless otherwise specified in advance, the dollar is always acceptable.
As far as backing, it isn't backed by any physical commodity.  The dollar's value is figuratively backed by the authority of the U.S. government.

That law says otherwise.  Refusing service is not the same as not accepting the dollar.

an obligatory payment; a fee. - 	Oxford American College Dictionary
every transaction that you make could be legally considered a due.  It just means a bill.

They're banning purchases with credit cards because idiots are using them to margin trade

Not gonna lie, I sold my entire (&lt;.1btc) stake after seeing this.  Took my 350% profit and walked out of there. I'll probably buy again when it hits 1800
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:19:30
There arw so many ways to say that without being condescending
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:39:06
No, I was looking more for a stable 1800.  Honestly I have so little invested that I only check once a day, lol

What did you say if not that?
