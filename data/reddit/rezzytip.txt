More companies like BISQ need to exist. We do need more fiat to crypto options. More specifically, a Fiat to Privacy coin would be quite amazing.
When btc dipped to 10k, GDAX wouldnt let me buy until it got back up to 14.5k, &amp;this was with fiat sitting in my gdax acct.

Not the time or place to take a stand on common phrases that annoy you.

I had to do the same backlogging on the ltc wallet. It was kind of neat watching the progress bar go from its inception to present day and thinking of all the transactions that have taken place with the crypto. Really puts it into perspective.

How can I counter "USD is valued by the military and economic value of itself?"
Its not worth it.

You come to the bitcoin sub to say gold has value bc jewelry and accessories and that bitcoin can go to zero?

What criminal uses a completely traceable currency with a public ledger? You sound brainwashed by the media. Silk road was a long time ago.

I mean, how many years were bitcoin wallets blocked? Devs had to use loopholes just to get listed in the store. If privacy is the goal, apple isnt the best to work with.
Not trying to start an apple v android argument, they both have pros and cons, and I personally wouldnt keep a significant amount on a mobile wallet regardless.

Came here to say this. This may solidify legitimacy in some eyes, but for those of us already a part of the market, it is not good news.

Its literally the solution to everything for them. As if security isnt an issue bc you can always just make 1tb blocks. Its ridiculous.

You have got to be fucking joking. Roger, Jihan, CSW altruistic? Get a grip and do some research buddy. If you think that any of them are interested in anything other than profitting (in dollars) with mining operations and failed attempts at patents, then you're delusional.
It is not a safe assumption to believe everyone in the space is in it for the betterment of the technology. You will be used up and spit out if you don't remain vigilant, or at the very very least, skeptical.
