If intraday prices are out there, I would love that too.

Moore's law doesn't quite work the same way for bandwidth.  You can get a fiber connection, but the number of bits you can send down a fiber doesn't double every 2 years, it creeps up at a snail's pace.

Why do I need to download a 3 gig blockchain?  Surely there is some statisitical/hash codey way to ensure the same blockchain with a couple hundred megabytes.  And imagine how ugly the blockchain will be in 20 years if the currency grows in popularity.   I want my wallet on my computer or phone, but I don't want every transaction in history.

I would bet the farm on the next cryptocurrency that A) enables transactions to clear in ten seconds (i.e., the time it takes to swipe a credit card at a busy bar) and B) only needs a 500 megabyte blockchain fragment (so it's easy to download onto a cell phone).  I would be willing to put up with the occasional crisis if those two things held true.

Well, apparently there's not yet very much cheating at the low money tables.  On they don't like seals because they can't paste hands into hand analysis sites.

Ah, well, that's easy to beat.  Fold when quiet player raises.

I've been looking at these, and they still require communicating with an online source that has the full blockchain.  And that's not much different from having a coinbase wallet.   If that source goes down, the client doesn't work.  I'm sure there's some way to implement a cryptocurrency in which you don't need an entire blockchain, but just a hash of a blockchain, such that there's only an infinitesimal chance that your wallet won't recognize the legitimate blockchain.

Any companies never sell themselves to other companies in exchange for lots of money?  Reddit is raising a million in VC cash right now, evaluating itself as a $400 million company, which seems a bit steep.  Alexis and spez sold it for $20 millionish when it probably had an eighth to a quarter of the uniques it does now, but was experiencing much more rapid growth.

I can't count the number of times I was hesitant to give a website credit card info.  One bad employee, and your card is for sale on a Russian website.  I paid for reddit gold in bitcoin.  If the site gets hacked,  I won't get doxxed.

How is a nit bot different than a bot?  And are these bots any good in games that aren't HU?

How long did it take to confirm the transaction went through?  Did the buyer tip?  And congrats.

No, it isn't.  We hit the limit already, and it is silicon.  We can send signals at almost the speed of light, and we will never send signals at double or quadruple the speed of light.  And fiber optics has been around for decades.   Moore's law will end soon too, when we reach the limit of atomic dimensions.   And it has already slowed as far as computational power is concerned.  It used to mean that every 2 year's you would go.from 1 GHz to 2 GHz.  But now we are stuck at 4 GHz, even though we can make gates smaller and smaller.

How, particularly?

I disagree, people change their minds all the time.  Even I've changed my mind once or twice.  It's especially easy to change minds if they think there's a danger in your bitcoin address being hacked.

I can't even register for the site.  So far it says country not allowed for Canada, and Ireland.  It could be checking IP ranges.

Do you have a graph of traffic pre and post campaign?

As far as I know sealswithclubs is the only site where you can consistently make bitcoins if you simply play hands with positive expectation value.

Storage space isn't a problem, but bandwidth is, especially with phones.  I'm happy to indefinitely tether my internet connection with unlimited 4G.  It's fast enough for videogames, and okay for streaming.  Once the blockchain is 300 gigabytes, I wouldn't even think of trying to download a wallet.  I never even finished downloading the 3 gig wallet because it slows down whatever else I'm doing online.  And being dependent on an online source with the wallet loses some of the cool, decentralized nature of bitcoin.  
I'm just saying that I'm sure there's a better mathematical way to do the cryptocurrency, where you might have the latest 10,000 transactions and some hash of the rest.   And a way that gives an infinitesimally small possibility that rival blockchains could coexist.
