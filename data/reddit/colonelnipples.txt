I do agree, awesome suggestion. I will put a tether icon there shortly. This was never an issue before hahaha, but now, it is.

We wanted to do daily summaries since we have the data, for example, largest trade of the day, most active exchange, etc.

No, let's say I want to buy 6 Bitcoin at 3050 and the current price is 3100, that means my order won't get filled until the price goes to 3050. If the price is 3055 and someone sells into my 3050 that is a sell, since they are selling into my order.

Hey, I run this tool. The buying / selling pressure uses weighted averages to determine the 60s / 5 min pressures.

Yeah, I think HitBTC wash trades, but I'm not sure. Hard to say for sure or not

If someone buys into a sell wall, it's a buy. If someone sells into a buy wall, it's a sell. Same goes with when someone presses market buy / market sell, it essentially buys or sells into the opposing wall. Hope this makes sense.

Exactly, a lot of panic sellers which makes me think this is, or is close to capitulation (just MY opinion). We will see how this plays out

Glad you like it! Please share it, even mentioning in groups or chats helps us a lot. We are relying on traffic right now and have some great plans upcoming for the application.

You don't need money for the website

This tool does the exact same thing, but it also allows you too change the significant amount, and also has an upgraded chart with other tools like volume, trade sizes, etc. It supports same exchanges. It is always going to be free, but we will have advertisements on the sidebar at some point I think.

Yes, everything works perfect. If you see a large trade and you have exchanges opened you can see it in both places.

It is trying to make a localhost request against our server, since it was originally intended locally when we were running tests getting https working. We will remove these console logs shortly
