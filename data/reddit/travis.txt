I wasn't calling you a troll I was trying to reply to your post in your comment history that was deleted and posted it accidentally to this chain. But then general tone of all your comments have a holier than tho attitude like you're just waiting to start something. Again, its pretty easy to see how 'all those poor indians' could use btc. 
EDIT: Cool, I can downvote your posts too. Stop being so self-righteous

Well one of your deleted posts from what I can see hinges on a picture of less well off people in India with you self righteously claiming something like "how these people gonna use btc".
The same way [people like this]( use [something like this]( .

Jokes and all aside, its more likely because we're 203 days away from the next Chinese new year. This always happens 203 days away.

Man, everyone here has [turned into Oprah]( handing out coins willy nilly. I imagine people are feeling like scarface just handing out tips to plebs.
