Thank you for the help! To be more clear: I have reason to believe someone jailbroke my old iPhone without my knowledge and installed spyware on it. I know some spyware has the ability to take screenshots at intervals. If they happened to take a screenshot while I was looking at my passcode (a string of words that bread wallet generated for me) then they'd have it and be able to move my wallet to their device, right?
The reason I asked about passcode is that I put a new battery in the old phone today (success) in an attempt to see if the wallet there still had the Bitcoin, but my passcode to the phone doesn't work anymore (failure). Is it possible for someone who has jailbroken your phone to remotely change your phone's passcode? 
Sorry this is so complicated! At least I have passed the anxiety / freaking out / being sick stage and am now just alternately numb and laughing a lot about the situation.

I just spent $50 on a new battery, which is rapidly depleting, only to learn that my passcode on the old phone no longer works. 
I had reason to believe a year ago that my phone had been jailbroken and spyware had been put on it, by the IT guy I used to give unfettered access to my laptop and phone once a year. Hypothetical question - if a person had remote access to my iPhone, could they change my passcode?

I rebooted the phone and synced again. The sync is now complete but still 0. Thank you for the help btw.

I rebooted phone and synced again. Sync now complete but still 0. The old phone would need another new battery put in it and then it would start draining power quickly, but I could have it on for a while. If I go this route, what do I need to do once I get the old phone back up? Scan the "receive" bar code? Sorry I'm such a newbie  - apologies if I'm not getting the terms right. And thank you for the help!

If I get the old phone booted up again, do I also need to take the sim card out of the new phone and put it back in the old one?
