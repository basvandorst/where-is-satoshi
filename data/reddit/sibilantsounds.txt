that's what im saying though.  never heard of anyone actually buying these things at those prices.  I just see people listing them at that price.  It's like going through the "sale period over" section on ebay where you see people listing things way above what people are willing to pay for.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:43:52
Yeah but people are actually buying both of those things at the given prices.
I've never seen anyone buy a casascius coin for their 'appreciated' value.  they either bought it directly when it was first listed or try to sell it to people that try to bring the price down.

I'm not swearing at you, just in general.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:13:23
maybe not from the ledger itself but you'd still have the 24 word seedphrase which means you can revive the keys on a different device like the trezor (and vice versa ie if trezor were to collapse, etc.)
there might even be 3rd party services that can work.  myetherwallet supports eth and bitcoin on their website through trezor and ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:09:09
You will be able to revive your wallet on any BIP39 compliant wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-03 09:09:49
even if it were to get corrupted both ledger and trezor run on BIP which means as long as you have the seedphrase you can still 'revive' your funds on a different wallet.
hardware wallets dont store your coins on them, just your private keys.  as long as you have the passphrase you still control the keys/access to your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:59:37
not even close.
it's only worth what people are willing to pay for and nobody is going to tack on another 5-7BTCs onto a coin worth 10BTC.
People can value/list it for w/e they want but until someone actually purchases it for a given value it's not worth anything.

@_date: 2017-12-10 16:48:09
I see a lot of bids but no confirmation of payments or goods delivered.
Also June prices were around 3k USD.
Paying 45k for 30k face value plus memorabilia makes sense.  Paying 6 figures is deluded.  Even at current price of 15k per btc and a coin worth 150k face value nobody is paying an additional 5-7 bitcoin for a fancy coin holding 10 btc at current prices. 
5 to 7 bitcoin right now is "find a safer place to put it" money, not "put it into a different medium for more than it's worth" money.
I imagine people will pay additional for it, just not 5-7 btc.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:19:15
thats why you write it down, send a bit of coinage, wipe it, then test recovery with the 24 seed word.
then you store your seed words away from anyone else's eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:46:51
yes, the ones with errors though right?  That part i can understand people would pay premium for.  Regular coins for a 5-7BTC surcharge though?  I really question those figures.

I dont think it's fake, just a bad puzzle made by amateurs.

or they suck at making puzzles and even worse hints.
amateur puzzle makers that think themselves clever make the worst puzzles bc they think unreasonably difficult to solve = good puzzle when puzzle making is actually a really difficult thing to pull off well.

@_date: 2018-05-26 04:50:13
i'm 99% sure the puzzle can't be solved with the hints given by the creators.  creating hard puzzles that can be solved is really really difficult.
guaranteed there's a step in there like "and if you take the BIP # of these letters and "try +1" to the words above the X, and -1 the words below the X, all divided under satoshi's birthday (bc satoshi is always above us), you have your seed!"

The nano does have a limited memory but you can always uninstall/reinstall the apps on the device and you won't lose your coins.

Seems weird to visit a sub just to talk shit on it but the energy comparison isn't really comparing the same thing.
Yeah Visa doesn't use as much energy, but they use up way more energy constantly to keep the company up and running.
They're comparing transactions to the total energy use of sending bitcoin including miners.  It'd be more accurate to compare nodes and transactions or to compare miners, btc transactions, and all of Visa's energy expenditures in whole.

With how many people Visa has employed I'm sure if we factored one office PC to every white collar worker the energy expenditures is much higher on visa's end.
Plus miners dont have to be running all the time everywhere for btc to work, people can run nodes on a Pi which uses a minuscule amount of energy and it's enough to get btc moving. You just need the confirmations to know you'll get the money.

By all accounts from the ledger website it says that you'll know when you get a fake or tampered nano because of the verification process through their website/chrome app.
Reviews on amazon purchases make me wary of buying one although I do want to buy another one as a back up asap.  Some of the bad reviews also seem to be user error rather than the device itself; in any case presumably the item would be returned to seller and I would prefer not to have a used nano, even if resetting the device is safe.
it's also cheaper to buy on amazon than to buy through ledgers' website, etc.
 A lot of on one hand this, and on the other hand that.
Keepkey is another hardware wallet but doesn't seem popular on account of its size.  Trezor and nano can both fit on a keyring and is easily portable. Keepkey isn't 'big' by any means but I think most people prefer the portability of the nano/trezor.
I own a nano and I think it's awesome.  Ended up picking it because it's cheaper and I don't have to put in my pin on a monitor.  Verification is done on the device itself, which means i'm safe from key logging/screen monitoring.
That said it was a difficult choice as I am a big fan of open source, which nano is only partially while trezor is fully open source.

I mean... do you feel guilty spending fiat?
The resources spent on cash goes well beyond what btc uses. I don't buy the naysayers argument, personally.
Pennies cost more to produce than they are worth, we're crushing up land to find more copper just to keep the mining companies happy. Mining (literal physical mining) costs a lot of money, resources, and leaves a huge carbon footprint.
Beyond that, there's cost for actually getting fiat out to people. Cars, planes, trains, boats, all deployed to send physical money.  I've never seen an electric Brinks security van. I definitely know they don't send cash on electric planes or boats, and I'm not sure electric cargo trains are a thing yet? 
Yes, the argument can be made that other things are shipped on those methods of transports and not just cash alone, but it's still not as "clean" as people think fiat is.
Doesn't end there. What about storage?  Granted banks don't take up that much space but what about all the banks across the country? What is their carbon footprint?
Yes, it takes less resources to use a credit card if you think about just swiping, but what about all those credit card offices?  Servers running 24/7 all over the world, and massive buildings that's constantly needing energy and infrastructure to keep up with running water, new office equipment, who knows what kind of chemicals to keep it clean, massive amounts of paper waste, mail sent out (more greenhouse gases!), people driving to and back for work that blockchain can take care of (soft argument I know) - more resources and greenhouse gases.
People make the argument of credit card companies and fiat using less energy but they never take the whole picture it takes to keep fiat alive and credit card companies running, not to mention all the extraneous factors like cc advertising, marketing, sponsorship, etc. 
I bet if piracy was a bigger issue that arose today they'd make the argument that it takes the work of all the computers connected to the torrent running all the time to send a movie...

Market order you're buying the first available bitcoin that's being sold.  This means you might end up paying higher or lower than the current posted price as your exchange updates prices.
Limit order, you're setting the price.  That means the the purchase won't trigger unless it hits a your specific price for your specific amount of bitcoin.  
Upsides: if you catch the timing right, you'll get exactly what you paid for, and on GDAX (and maybe other exchanges as well), you won't pay fees on the purchase.
Downside: If you catch the timing wrong, your purchase might not trigger in time.  ex: You want to purchase at lower than the posted price but nobody put in a sell at your limit order and the price keeps going up so your purchase doesn't trigger as the price goes to the moon; conversely, you want to purchase as soon as possible so you set a limit order at a higher than market price hoping the price will catch up but it starts to dip immediately after you buy.
In stocks and crypto, there has to be someone buying/selling for them to fill your order, so it takes a bit of getting used to.  I've never had the latter issue in GDAX myself but have heard of other people having that happen to them.  I have had that experience in trading stocks though.

Dunno enough about the 90s models to say either way.
Haven't seen one on the road that looks like in good enough condition to warrant 5k either.

I had $300 in my PayPal and a POS Dell inspiron so I considered paying a miner for btc back in 09-10.
Then I thought "if I'm using PayPal to send money why am I bothering with this coin that I cant even spend yet?"

They do have something similar.
Just google "physical bitcoin."
I dont remember if it was real gold but they had the option of them loading the public/private key for you inside the coin that you can open up or you printing out and putting in the private inside the coin yourself.

If I were OP I would've asked "you have mining money?"

With the usb and ubuntu thing its just another layer of safety.
People aren't going to recommend unsafe ways of doing things.  If you're holding a large amount of money, its definitely worth the time to do it right with usb and ubuntu.  Make sure to do it offline.
It's not just a matter of viruses but possible network weakneses, key loggers, screen recorders, etc.
