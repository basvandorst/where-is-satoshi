When everyone thinks one thing is going to happen...

I am not arguing about which currency is better but I was curious what would happen if one of the forks became more popular than the original BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:36
any chance you can elaborate on that? I am just wondering what happens if BTC is no longer used due to something like transaction fees being higher or transaction times being too long.

I am not worried, I am just wondering how it would work from a technical standpoint. It sounds like the odds of the chain having a fatal issue is almost nonexistent.

LN is not the ledger, it uses the BTC chain for all final signatures and is built upon it. How would LN work without it?

That will be .0001BTC, please

Not to be a dick but, this is a simple google search. If you don't know what blockchain is, I would start there and then come back to asking questions like you have.

I would gladly take that hit and have sold at $19,000 to re purchase now.

Yeah, not like it is easy for people to get a brokerage account and start buying.
