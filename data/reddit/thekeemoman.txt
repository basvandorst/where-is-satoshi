Holy shit that is insane.

Yea, thanks, I got it. BL is bad. Don't buy from them.

So lets assume they shipped on time, thanks to for showing me the Genesis Block calculator, and [these are my results]( So I would break even in just under 2 months, and make a small amount of profit in march and april, right before it becomes about worthless. Couldn't I just sell it on Ebay for a couple hundred dollars?
@_date: 2014-09-06 17:56:56
How much did it cost if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:10:57


Wow, all in a $1 difference range. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:28:15
Oh hahaha, I had no idea. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 18:09:32
Nice. Congrats on the car!

Anywhere that accepts them.

Muslims founded algebra, among other scientific discoveries.

Im sad to have to agree.

I was under the impression that it was only if you got an invite?
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:08:22
In that case your a fucking genius. Did you sell any when it peaked? 
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:10:08
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:02:40
No offense but that was as a pretty stupid idea.

How do i make money playing color virus? 
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:02:36
Could you give us an estimate of the ratio of cash in to cash out? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:41:24
You can't be telling me that using data 35,000 feet in the sky on a chunk of metal is less than I actually pay on the ground in the emirates.

I don't understand the website. It costs more money to rent a server than you would make off of it? 
@_date: 2015-03-08 00:06:09
Don't know how I am going to rent a rig with 10 cents but thanks hahaha
@_date: 2017-07-14 10:50:59
Everything would be cheaper and we would have less money. It would be the same as it is now.

This sounds smart. It would be easy to code a bot to slightly misspel a different set of words in each email to trip up mail filiters. This seems overkill however.
