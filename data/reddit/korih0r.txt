Congrats on that, but anecdotes =/= data.
You will see 0 sat/byte transactions get confirmed all the time--but you'll see many more expire before entering a block. You got lucky.

Does splitting just mean 'sweeping' your balance on both chains? Once you have done this is there any further risk of replay attacks or loss of coins on either chain?
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:45:12
That would require a majority of BCC miners to switch to the 0.14.5 client by Aug 1 even though it just came out hours ago. Is that very likely?

This is the right answer. Make sure to short the housing bubble while you're at it. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:38:23
It's for sure.
Edit: Here's some info that might help you
* A [guide]( for moving from Coinbase to an external wallet (Electrum)
* Once the fork happens, you should sweep your BTC balance with an OP_RETURN transaction followed by the string "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". This will make sure that your balance cannot be replayed on the BCC chain. Then and only then you can safely withdraw your balance on BCC without any risk of your coins being taken. For more info, read [this](
* **Warning**: if you attempt to make a transaction on the BCC chain without first doing the step I described above, your BTC may be taken in a replay attack. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:58:35
The ETH fork was also several days *retroactive* (and "erased" the intervening blockchain history), whereas we know a week in advance that BCC will happen. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:05:34
I doubt you can. You will probably want to move the keys to a client that will allow you to edit raw transactions (Electrum on a desktop computer will allow this, I don't think the mobile app does). 
The basic idea is to write a transaction with your pre-fork wallet as input and **two** outputs.
* Output 1 will send all of your coins to the new wallet you are sweeping in to
* Output 2 will send 0 coins to an OP_RETURN output, followed by the magic string: "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
That second output with the magic string will ensure that the transaction cannot be replayed on the BCC chain. I really hope that somebody makes a way to do this more easily, but for now the only way you can do this is highly technical.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:21:15
What an idiotic thing to lie about. Minimum fee transactions often take less time than Coinbase. Hell, I've seen 0 fee transactions confirmed in less time than Coinbase. Meanwhile they make you pay some of the highest fees in the business and GDAX artificially slows it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:03:52
'Sweeping' is just emptying one wallet into another wallet in your posession. 
OP_RETURN is a script opcode added in Core 0.9 which allows you to embed 40 bytes of arbitrary data to the blockchain. It's basically a bogus black-hole 'address' that you can send things to. 
So what you will want to do is make a transaction with two outputs which sends all of your bitcoin to a new wallet you own (output 1) and 0 bitcoin to an OP_RETURN with the magic string (output 2). Do not send any actual bitcoin to OP_RETURN because they will be permanently destroyed. 
Since this transaction contains the OP_RETURN output and the magic string, it will be 'invisible' to the BCC chain, but in the BTC chain it will put your coins into a new wallet. It's all pretty tricky. I honestly don't know how to do this without using the Bitcoin RPC or editing a raw transaction. Maybe somebody else knows.

Censorship is when mods delete posts because they disagree with their narrative. I'm not going to comment on this sub's approach to censorship... but deleting posts that are trollish or incoherent is moderation and not censorship.
If you can show that the post(s) you were banned for were not blatantly trollish, that would greatly strengthen your point. They have public mod logs, so you don't have much excuse not to.

There's no way to be 100% sure unless you download it from Github with SSL and compile it yourself. 
The [Bitcash]( people host binaries. They don't post hashes, but I would consider this to be a very trustworthy source since it's hosted on a site with SSL and a domain known to be them. 
This is still not as certain as compiling things by yourself, and I would always suggest that people with considerable bitcoin holdings compile their clients.

That being said, you know people WILL be scammed because people will promise them 'Bitcoin Cash' and they will think they are being given real Bitcoin.

If shitcoin ends up with a non-negligible value it will devalue your BTC, which is why the lack of replay protection is really fucking scummy on ABC's part. Ideological things aside, it's worth it for people to secure their BCC. It's not 'free money' as a lot of naive people seem to be implying. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:44:24
It won't be 'automatic', but any value held by BCC will effectively devalue BTC (which is why a lot of people are hoping it will become worthless). Your intuition is basically correct. There are some naive people who seem to think that BCC is free money. It's not, any value it has will come from what is already in the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:18:34
No, I don't think you can edit raw transactions on there either. 
Good news though, you shouldn't have to worry about it. The ABC folks pushed out strong replay protection for their 0.14.5 client, so you won't have to worry about splitting your coin as long as that gets majority mining support (which it *almost* definitely will).
In that case you can just sweep your bitcoin on any regular wallet application and then safely pull out your BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:14:37

I'm no economist, but I'd imagine after Aug 1 would be a good time to buy since I'm assuming the price will go down because of general panic and uncertainty. No other milestones that I can think of, but maybe somebody else knows. One piece of advice that I would give is don't keep large amounts of coin (&gt;$300 worth) in an exchange or online wallet service. Set up an Electrum and move everything there as soon as you can.

@_date: 2017-07-27 22:25:13
I'm with you, and if I could wave a magic wand I would give all of the miner support to BCC. Unfortunately, since they failed to get consensus, I see alts as the better option.
The thing is, small blockers don't actually want bitcoin to scale. You'll see a lot of people say that it's a 'store of value'. Their vision is of bitcoin being a reserve currency with a limited transaction bandwidth which can be exchanged for low-fee, faster alts which do all of the legwork. 
Layer2 and offchain solutions may streamline things, but they will only ever allow marginal scaling. You can't get around the fact that 1MB / 10 minutes or even 8MB / 10 minutes is never going to be sufficient for bitcoin to scale so that it can actually be used by more than 10-20 million people. 
If Bitcoin were to reach Visa levels (which is the dream a lot of people have), the blockchain would have to grow by gigabytes per day. Big blocks are the only way to reach this, but they would represent a major shift in who gets to control and run the network, which is what small blockers want to prevent.
Also, the people in charge of deciding which changes are pushed on to the blockchain are the miners themselves who benefit from high fees.

Great analysis. It's very insightful to bring the idea of network effects into bitcoin. I will remember this in the future. 
As you said, this is a worst case model, and it's probably silly to assume that anybody who participates in the bitcoin network will abandon the BCC network completely and vice versa. Any pre-fork user will become part of the BCC network at zero cost, and I imagine most will participate in both (maybe one more than the other).
What would you say about the intermediate case, where not all who move onto another network are removed from the previous network?

Electrum will probably not support BCC as far as I know. I've set up a Bitcoin ABC node for the purpose of dumping BCC, but there may be an easier way out there that I don't know about. 
Before you touch your BCC, you must do [this]( to your BTC. This effectively sweeps your BTC balance with a special magic string "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" which will cause a replay attempt to be rejected on the BCC chain. It will also prevent BCC transactions from being replayed on the BTC chain, because a replay attack requires referencing a pre-fork txid, and the OP_RETURN transaction would have a post-fork txid.

If/when BCC splits, there will be two blockchains with a common history. From what I understand, there will be no automatic replay protection, so you will initially have the same balance on both chains. 
Additionally, I believe that if you make a Segwit transaction on the BTC chain, an attacker could use the information to make an identical transaction on the BCC chain and take your BCC. There are tricks that can make transactions on BCC invalid on BTC and vice versa. So far I haven't seen any method of coin splitting which I would actually be willing to try, though.
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:29:31
No, you dictate the fees yourself, and miners will decide how long it takes for your transaction to enter a block. Higher fees result in faster transactions, since miners take the fees. You can decide your fee based on how long you want the transaction to take, but client software will often take care of this for you using an algorithm which chooses a reasonable fee for you.
Hell, if you check today's blockchain you'll even see some lucky transactions confirmed with 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:34:17
Yes, it does! Following the fork, you will have just as many coins on the BCC chain as the BTC chain. Any BTC you spend after the BCC fork can potentially be replayed on the BCC network and allow anybody to take your balance on the BCC chain. If you don't care about that, then you're fine, but you may be missing out on a lot of money! BCC futures are currently trading at ~$4-500 USD, and IF BCC actually ends up trading at this level, it **will** devalue your BTC by a comparable amount.
So if you do not get your coins out of Coinbase by Aug 1, you may be looking at an attacker effectively stripping off ~20% of the value off of your coins. If you are considering getting off of Coinbase, you need to act fast, because they will likely put a 3-day freeze on your coins (as those fuckers did for me).
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:07:48
It will always be a hell of a lot harder to regulate than any traditional asset though. For example:
* You can't prove that I own a bitcoin without proving that I have access to the private keys.
* You can't prove that I have access to the private keys without getting me to divulge them or sign something with them, and the Supreme court has determined that Law Enforcement cannot compel someone to divulge up a cryptographic key. 
* If my keys are encrypted and I refuse to decrypt them (or just deny that I can), nobody can seize it, and neither can anybody even prove that I own the coin!
It's a lot harder to regulate an asset that you cannot seize or prove people own. When you want to seize funds from the bank account, you give them a phone call. When you want to seize cash or gold, you just kick the door down. 
They will try their best, no doubt, but unless they put up the hashing power they can never tame the beast.

This step could still get your BCC stolen since it relies on ABC competently implementing replay protection on their chain. They have [promised]( to implement stronger replay protection than the OP_RETURN trick, but you may still want to do it anyway. Other than that what you described is a good way to do it.

@_date: 2017-07-26 00:43:36
Yes you would want to do this after Aug 1.
Any wallet that allows you to make raw transactions support OP_RETURN, in which case you might want to get a hang of the blockchain [scripting language]( I think Electrum allows you to make raw transactions although I've never used it. 
The Bitcoin Core command line interface also allows you to do this by making [RPC calls]( The Ledger hardware wallet is the only one I know of which will do it automatically.
@_date: 2017-07-26 00:30:06
Yeah it's pretty damn confusing. You can thank Jihan Wu for that. 
Basically on Aug 1 you are being airdropped free BCC in an amount that is equal to how many BTC you previously owned. The problem is, the moment you make a BTC transaction, this transaction could be copied on the BCC chain by a stranger who could steal your coins. 
You can guaranteed prevent this by sweeping your wallet on the BTC chain with an additional output (for 0 coins) with a OP_RETURN script followed by a magic string "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". 
Team ABC have just pushed an additional update which will provide automatic protection, but which will only work if it is adopted by a majority of ABC miners. If 51% of ABC miners aren't running 0.14.5, then you may lose BCC coins when you make transactions on the BTC chain.

@_date: 2017-07-26 04:44:12
If you sign and broadcast a transaction on one fork, the same transaction will appear as valid on the other fork, meaning that an attacker can copy it over to the other fork (replay attack), and it will be accepted as valid without your knowledge or permission, resulting in you losing your coins.
This can be prevented by 'replay protection' when the developers of the two forks agree on a standard way to signal which transaction belongs to which fork, so that they will be recognized as invalid by the other fork when an attacker attempts to make a copy.
FWIW, a few hours ago ABC rolled out client version 0.14.5 which will enforce strong replay protection, so if it gets majority miner support you won't have to worry about replay attacks at all.
@_date: 2017-07-25 20:29:36

Not officially, although a few lines of python can do the job. The Bitcoin ABC client is basically a clone of the Bitcoin Core client with tweaks under the hood and as such stores all private/public keys in a BerkeleyDB format (wallet.dat file). 
It's just a simple key/value database. If you dig around somebody has possibly made the tool you're looking for. I'm reading up on it right now and I'm planning to use the [bsddb]( library for Python 2.
Edit: 
A much easier way to do all of this would be to sweep your coins into Bitcoin ABC **pre-fork** (make sure you have enough time and resources to download the entire blockchain or copy it in from elsewhere) and then post-fork follow [this guide]( to move the keys into Electrum on the BTC chain. Split your coins there and then you will be able to spend on both chains with no worries.

I get that LN would allow instant transactions between people, but I still don't see how it solves the problem of global transaction volume, since bitcoin would still have a hard ceiling of bytes-per-time that can be recorded on the blockchain--1MB/10 minutes. Unless Lightning Network or another off-chain solution could conceivably reduce ALL on-chain activity on the planet to under 1MB/10 mins in the case that bitcoin reached Visa-level adoption, it seems inevitable that this ceiling will have to be increased.
In a practical setting how often would I open or close a channel? Once a day? Once a month? Suppose one day I open a channel. Then I buy a coffee from Alice, then Bob buys a sandwich from me, then I buy an ice cream from Claire. At the end of the day I close the channel and the balances for myself, Alice, Bob and Claire are updated on the blockchain. How many less bytes does this require than the 4 transactions separately? Intuitively it doesn't seem like much is saved at all, am I wrong? The blockchain must still eventually record all 4 of our public keys + signatures and the changes in balance (even though the order of these would be very different from how it works now), and it would have to do so in a roughly 24 hour period. Even if everybody adopted the LN method, it still seems that the on-chain bytes-per-time requirement wouldn't be significantly reduced from where it's at. 
It seems that it would only be significantly reduced in the case that there were multiple transactions back and forth between myself and a single other person, but since it is now common for every recipient to receive each new transaction with a new address, every time I buy a coffee from Alice she would appear as a completely new person to the payment channel and the data savings are lost.

If your wallet is completely encrypted with a passphrase only known to you, then, provided you have taken the right precautions, nobody can take it from you unless you divulge the passphrase. 
Even better, if they can't decrypt your wallet and you have never leaked the public keys to the internet (running a full node is the best way to do this) then nobody can even prove that you have any bitcoin at all! 
United States v. Doe has ruled by the 5th Amendment that the government cannot compel one to produce an encryption passphrase. How, then, can bitcoin be taken from you by force if it cannot be retrieved without compelling someone to divulge an encryption key?

They froze a lot of people's transactions for 3 days, but from what I understand they only do this for very large sums (&gt;$1000 worth or something). If that isn't the case for you, then that probably isn't the cause of the delay.

I've looked into LN and 'micropayment channels' and I know how HTLCs work, what I don't understand is wouldn't every transaction still need to end up on-chain eventually? I get that I could buy a coffee from Alice off-chain and defer the actual recorded payment until later, but wouldn't every node eventually have to contain a record of my payment anyway? I get the appeal of home users being able to run nodes and the motive of keeping the blockchain small, but I have a really hard time understanding how off-chain solutions fix the fundamental problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:11:14
Because ~1% of bitcoin holders actually do this. Also not enough people run full nodes despite the fact that small-blockers have fought so hard to keep it practical.

You transmitted that comment over SSL.
Saying SSL today almost always actually refers to TLS. You apparently failed to read the very first sentence of the [Wikipedia article]( The most common implementation of TLS comes from a library called OpenSSL, and it's what I meant when I said SSL. You seem to be clueless about what you're talking about.


Shellshock? Heartbleed? They do not represent fundamental flaws in the cryptography but bugs in the implementation. There are no known vulerabilities in the *latest implementation* of OpenSSL. In theory, SSL is as safe as long as the discrete logarithm problem remains difficult to solve.
My point stands that most traffic over the internet is encrypted with SSL, so suggesting that the government could just 'block all crypto' is completely absurd and would be tantamount to shutting down the entire internet just to stop bitcoin. 
And no, changing the port would not cause a soft fork to bitcoin. The bitcoin client can already connect to other clients via ANY port through UPnP protocol. The 8333 port is just a convenience. 


This is true, the hardware they already use for password cracking or encryption cracking would probably be sufficient if it were directed at the bitcoin network, but that doesn't mean this would come at anywhere *near* zero cost to them. I still think it's fair to say that the electricity costs alone would make subverting the bitcoin network this way a multi-billion dollar endeavor (and not worth it), but I'll admit that nobody can really know for sure what they have up their sleeves.

How well do you trust this? Would you still suggest doing the OP_RETURN shit?
Edit: it seems like this would depend on a majority of BCC miners using the 0.14.5 client. How can people be assured that this will be the case?

If you look at the early blockchain, there is evidence that Satoshi owns ~1 million bitcoin (Sergio Lerner laid it out pretty well). That is around 6% of all bitcoin in circulation and 4.8% of all bitcoin there will ever be. If bitcoin reached a value somewhere around $87,000 (not unreasonable that it could happen, but probably not by 2018) then Satoshi would have around $87 billion worth of bitcoin.

Once Electrum gives you the receiving address, there isn't anything more you need to do. Once you send your coins to this address, Electrum will see the transaction when it appears on the chain.

I have no doubt that SW works well, but it only provides a limited scaling solution to bitcoin. At the rate bitcoin is being adopted 1MB (or even 8MB) every 10 minutes will simply not be enough to handle all transactions that people want to make, even with SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:25:00
But do you actually know? I'm not sure whether it's a static 8MB increase or an adjustable on-chain scaling method.

'Sweeping' just means emptying your current balance into a new freshly-generated key. 
Loading your wallet.dat into ABC will give it access to your HD seed and your private keys, which some people are worried about--ABC is a carbon copy of Core with the same BIP 32 wallet format.
ABC is open source and myself and a lot of people have inspected the code. I personally believe that it is safe to use and that it was not designed to steal keys, but I don't expect you to take my word for it! Do some research and make sure that all clients you use are trustworthy. If you are still worried about this I would suggest sweeping on the BTC chain first with an entirely new wallet.dat, since this will prevent any glitch or attack from ABC from taking your BTC.

They went to shit many years ago. I still don't understand (or care) what "Gamer Gate" was all about, but it sent the verge and many others absolutely off the rails. Ever since then Vox and all of its spinoffs have endlessly churned out tabloid-type garbage and drama.

2 days for a vault withdrawal and an additional 72 hour waiting period. Only then did they allow me to make the transaction which took several more hours.

Don't you understand? They're doing you a favor. They're providing a regulation framework with proper consumer protections so that people can invest in bitcoin without losing their life savings. /s
In all seriousness I believe the servers were located in Russia, so they *might* still be able to grab a new domain and get back up and running. The Russian gov't may take over operations as they have done before.

I'm not completely sure either, but I do know that the Gox coins were siphoned out very slowly in to wallets controlled by Vinnik and then moved directly into BTC-e's internal storage (they didn't go through any of BTC-e's customer deposit addresses).
Who knows whether BTC-e knew or cared where they came from.

You could lose your BCC if the ABC clowns don't push out 0.14.5 with proper replay protection to enough miners. If you don't care then don't sweat it, but right now BCC futures are trading &gt;$400 USD so you could be miss out on some big money.

You don't know that. ETC still has a non-negligible value a year after the Ethereum split. I damn-well hope that BCC is worthless but since I am not a clairvoyant (and I assume you aren't either) there is no way I can confidently say that BCC will have no value. 
In fact it's pretty naive to assume that it will. If it's worth a penny on August 2nd, you know there are going to be people who will buy the shit out of it. Next thing you know it's worth $10 on August 3rd.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:30:21
The security and integrity of any crypto currency depends on hashpower, which is one of the biggest reasons why BTC is the most trusted name in the game. 
If we lose that to Bitcash, Bitcoin would probably be dumped hard and Bitcash would become seen as the 'true' Bitcoin.

First sweep your regular BTC post-fork using Core.
Download [Bitcash ABC]( and load your wallet.dat. Make sure it uses a separate data directory, although you can copy your pre-fork blockchain data so that you don't have to download it all again. Sweep that to a new key and you're pretty much good.

The moment any kind of cryptography is possible, it is impossible for the gov't to distinguish between cryptocurrency traffic and any other kind of traffic. Stunnel, for example, can wrap absolutely any TCP traffic in SSL. You are correct to say that most miners and nodes are not using this today (since there is no need), but it would be a trivial thing to implement.


And if any become known, they will be fixed the next day because billions of dollars of business infrastructure relies on it. True of literally any kind of security software. Keep your stuff updated and properly configured 


The government cannot decrypt up to date and properly configured TLS. I'm sure they can do a hell of a lot more than people know, but they aren't magicians. The underlying theory behind TLS is solid, but if various implementations slip up that's another issue.
If your point is that the gov't *could* break bitcoin if they pulled out absolutely all the stops, I could hardly disagree with you. It would still be a mammoth task. For them to do so today, when it's used by 10 million people at most (most of whom are libertarian ideologues and people trying to make a quick buck off of price volatility), would be ridiculous and reckless. Maybe someday when it is more subversive and threatening they will try to take it down.

@_date: 2017-07-28 19:57:42


Do you mean encrypted traffic? You realize even China allows SSL, right? 
Almost **all** internet traffic in 2017 involves crypto. If the gov't were to use some sort of deep packet inspection to block ALL crypto traffic, then all forms of online banking or shopping would become impossible. In fact no online service that requires password authentication--including social media--would be possible, since any intervening party could trivially eavesdrop the connection and steal your credentials.
Bitcoin nodes can't even be stopped by blocking port 8333, since this can be instantly changed to any port using the `-port=&lt;port&gt;` flag. 
Also, while I agree with you that the US Gov't certainly has a hashpower arsenal that could be used to subvert bitcoin, the genius of the Proof-Of-Work method is that the cost/value breakdown of trying to subvert the network isn't ever worth it. The US government would have to invest more to break the network than they would ever be able to recover by doing so.
The cost of subverting bitcoin today would require billions of dollars worth of equipment and power, which is exactly why people are willing to trust billions of dollars of value in the network.
