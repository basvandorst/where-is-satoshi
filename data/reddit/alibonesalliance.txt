Is this going to make those bitcoin cash things appear if I add my private keys from my last wallet.
I haven't updated since 2.8.1.
Working fine since, I've never had too.
Just realized recently that there was going to be that last update that supposedly snatches all your wallets and gifts you BCC?

Great question, us it going to have the ability to sign transactions like comb.in or armory?

Authy is better in that you cab recover a lot easier than GA. 
Funny thing, it's not impossible to disable GA, just ask them to do it for you. Explaining you lost your phone and never backed up your keys.
They will comply.

Think about it, why would you let go off precious at key points,

Think of all the snail traders not cashing out by conventional means, however having purchasing power beyond archaic means. Now they find themselves holding liquifiable assets/commodity that has and will continue to take us for a roller coaster ride to the moon. I believe bitcoin businesses stand a chance (Overdtock.com), competitively by riding the next innovative ways.
