I disagree my friend. I can just about smile and ignore the "I told you so"s, the worst thing about bitcoin is I am buying a new kitchen and don't have the money to buy the dips in any meaningful amount. :)

Don't even try to, you will never buy the bottoms or sell the tops. If you have done your own due dill, buy it and hold it even if it keeps coming off. If information changed, changing your opinion, cut your losses and move on.

Fingers crossed for you man, it's not a nice feeling having so much cash in the air with little in the way of recourse should the recipient turn out to be lacking scruple.

2 bursts of reviews and all lower case titles, same broken English in all of them, this just screams "review service" to me. Anyone know if Audible have any sort of moderation in place or is may paranoia completely unfounded?

until you get filled as many times as you've clicked...
Then good luck making the roundtrip out of the extra position and wonder if you will overshoot that way next..

I was in a similar situation not a long time ago. I transferred 10k euro and it was nowhere to be seen until I contacted Kraken and it turned out that the bank person I asked to do the transfer, didn't put the reference quite right. 
Kraken support sorted it out very quickly though.
I know people seem to love to shit on Kraken here lately and as a frustrated user who just recently failed to do a trade 4 times in a row, then found out that I got filled twice 30 minutes later I certainly think the rap they are getting is well deserved. But I think this post does them a great disservice as so far I found no reason to doubt their reputation for being honest with your money and hope once this matter is resolved you will come back here and update us even if it turns out to have been your fuckup in the end :)

so a government being free to run their ountry as they see fit, is a sign of oligarchy? Ok, got it, thanks.

That is the story. I sure hope so but you never can tell

Since when is JP Morgan an authority on Bitcoin?
Didn't Jamie say he will fire anyone who invested into bitcoin or something? I should imagine the atmosphere a the company is toxic enough for people not to want to spend anytime understanding the "beast"

I beg to differ, "you will be proven right if you wait long enough", is a saying long predating bitcoin trading for a reason.
Bitcoin has no costs associated with storage and is not exposed to counterparty or venue risk, while your advice is solid, I think bitcoin lends itself very well to long term investing. The only things that I really concern myself with is affordability (don't spend on BTC what you cannot afford to lose) and opportunity cost (things that have a better return you could have deployed your capital into). The second part is not currently an issue unless you know somwhere else I could have parked my money at the beginning of the year and returned 228% after the "crash".
Every investment can go to zero in theory, so this is not a trait unique to bitcoin. I think holders are investing, people who sell as well as buy are trading, which is a completely different class of bitcoin participant.

Don't sweat it, bought it at 2300, 3400, 3495, 4100, 4500. It will all feel like a no-brainer in 3 year's time. Jut be sure to be able to afford what you spent and stop watching the daily noise.

can you ELI5 the whole forking thing please for those of us who are not passionate enough to keep track of and understand how blockchain works? I hold Bitcoin in the same way I would hold gold or oil, just one more asset I like and get the broad idea behind, not something I would spend hours researching.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:17:15
I can't, I already spent £30k this month... But I would aboslutely love to buy more. grrr.

I actually think that this might be the case too. NDRC love to try to set prices for commodities, such as coal for example, China consumes 60% of all coal. I am no expert on crypto, but from what I understand, China is also over half of world's hash rate with ambitions to dominate the crypto industry, so why not come out with these statements to influence the price if you can right? I think in both cases the ultimate price setter is supply vs demand, however, and it's people who do not realise it that are currently selling. My only worry is that I don't have more money to buy these panicked sells.

Without saying more than I am allowed to, I may be privy to some plans, currently being reviewed in another part of Russia that has super super cheap electricity and spare capacity to install a fuckton of mining gear.
On that basis, I'd say your optimism is Justified.
How did you invest in Russian bitcoin mining bwt?

For the same reason you would buy a shop gift voucher, locking yourself in to one store chain only, with an expiry date and at a 1:1 exchange rate... people are dumb.
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:34:29
I am scared too! I am scared this dip won't last long enough for me to buy more as I don't have much expendable cash left for this month.

I mentioned Coinbase in the very first paragraph. I have done all they asked for, yet the website is so counter-intuitive or poorly designed, I am still unable to make a transaction. (see details above). Will try Kraken. thanks for the tip

Thanks for the concise write up, I mentioned mining as the simpler alternative to buying coins (which is what I have done in the past)
EDIT: My complaint isn't the regulation on the ID front, it's the execution by what I thought was the biggest provider.
It's half-assed at best.
