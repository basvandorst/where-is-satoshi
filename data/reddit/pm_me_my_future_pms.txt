LN said the average would be 12-14 channels a year. 20 million bitcoin users would crash the 1mb block size and not be able to load or settle a channel.
You now think bitstamp will pay the channel open and settle fee for you? That would be nice of them, lucky they are not part of NASA I guess.




How much is that? Spending money so $500? No need to reload it all year or is Bitstamp going to pay the fee again for you? Ah in addition it will be a good idea to hold your spending money on exchanges, that makes sense, what could go wrong with 10 million people holding a grand or five on exchanges to cover spending.




    
Wallets have not added segwit in 6 months (sitting at 10%), most exchanges have not either, but they will add in LN which is orders of magnitude more difficult. Can't wait, and they will pay the load and settling fees, these exchanges are amazing.




My hope is bcash never fills a single block ever. My hope is bitcoin does not make itself obsolete despite a 9 year head start due to inaction in the face of a gridlocked broken tx system.

LN team answered many of these question.
They predicted 12-14 channels a year for a typical user.
Funding was also answered and they stated you will need -more- than what you expect to spend to be able to balance the nodes on each channel.
The actual devs gave the answers.

How many channels will a typical user open and close in a year?
    
How much will they fund each channel with? (how long will these funds stay locked up on the channel, is that normal to lock up large sums of money to make a monthly payment, essentially pre paying for a year)?
     
Will you need to overfund a channel to participate?
    
How easy is it for new people to learn and understand bitcoin? Now they have to learn a whole new set of steps to use it?
    
Side bet you won't answer these questions?

He would have gave that to them too.
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:49:17
It is a multisig tx so 1.3 times the size.
200 sat * 1.3 is 260 sat per byte to open and another 260 to close it.
$40 to complete the cycle on a hub sounds not fun at all, you would have to make 40+ tx on it to make any sense at all maybe 200.
    
Funding for rebalancing requires quite a bit more than what most will be willing to throw into the system, $1000 is out of reach of 95% of users.
    
But hey no worries this will fix everything and is NOT overly complicated at all. It is easy to explain bitcoin to new people, easy as pie, so adding LN to further explain this simple tech will be so easy too, so so easy.

Did you tell him it requires him to pre fund the channel with a fairly substantial chunk of bitcoin to participate on the LN?
He pays about 2% now for CC processing but he will most likely outsource the bitcoin/LN processing as well and it will have a fee too.
    
Should have told him to spend 4-5 hours going over his cost of goods to find 5-10 percent in savings and be FAR ahead. Guarantee his limited time in a work week would be better spent decreasing costs of goods and services while look at concrete ways to increase sales.

Injects politics into his talks, does admit to being colossally wrong but fails to entertain the idea he might be wrong again.
Prior to the massive donation it was legitimately difficult to tell which side of the bitcoin controversy he was on, once he had a massive vested stake on one side, he dropped the pretense of being neutral.
    
I used to like the guy 100% and think he deserved that donation and that Roger is a douche and hurts crypto, but now I like Andreas at about 60%

You might be surprised at how accepting the community is to a blocksize increase in light of the massive spike in adoption.
A hardfork to 4mb would give the coin some breathing room until LN comes onboard but at that time it would require yet another blocksize increase due to LN's needs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:03:02
99% of them, the rest use it to buy other crypto even though they should use eth or ltc
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:10:16
The big move has been away from bitcoin as the trade between exchanges, very few use them unless its a massive move. Everyone you know uses eth or litecoin to move between exchanges.
Wonder how interested the exchanges will be in locking up massive numbers of bitcoins in side chains.
Will lead to further consolidation of exchanges as they will play favorites.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:28:36


It already has horribly.
Had they done something to address usability, the coin would be at or above 75% cap, 3 maybe 4 times its value, and 1000s more stores would be accepting it instead of the daily announcements of ditching it.

50k is not too much and neither is 500k
    
It might be too much if it is all the wealth you own. To many people 50k is not a big deal at all. That is hard for a lot of people to grasp. These people look at you saying 50k is waaaaay too much and think you have no idea what you are talking about.

@_date: 2018-01-08 10:04:30


Wouldn't that lead big miners to spam the hell out of blocks to make minting new coins 10x faster?
Also the difficulty sets the average time, so the difficulty would need to reset per block instead of 2 weeks which opens up another debate.

People in general do not know or care to know about centralization, the money supply, fiat, QE1-3, libor, fractional reserves.
    
To the masses its completely over their heads, to those that care, they love Bitcoin for all the right reasons.
    
You should not be surprised when the masses can be tricked into backing a premined/never mined centralized fake coin(s). You can try and stop the herd but your will get run over no matter what.

You paid for an expensive lesson.
You used a public computer to access personal/financial sites (it could have any software on it installed).
    
You googled the site instead of typing it in directly (got phished with an ad link).
    
You did not notice the wrong url in the address bar.
You repeatedly gave the 2FA codes when they requested them.
    
You then gave away your gmail password to the fake binance site.
     
I mean how just how...

It reduces the size/weight of a tx.
So you can pay the same sat per byte and you would pay less but get processed at the same speed or up the sat per byte and pay the same but get processed faster.

Or you could just buy it yourself and not be weird.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:53:52
It will???
So the mempool is high with high fees.
    
Someone is going to load a LN channel and pay the high fee to get on the channel and spend their $300 in spending money (losing 5-10% just to load up).
And the fees won't go up due to the new pressure on the mempool?
Then you follow that up with a catch all, if not use litecoin?
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:04:35
My only point is that the official wallet has not even added support for it. If they aren't in a hurry to do it, no one should be surprised we are sitting at 10% adoption.

You would pay a high fee to open a channel then you would pay a tiny fee to pay each month then a high fee to pay off the loan and close/settle the channel. 
    
You would also have to preload the channel with more than just the months worth of payments but who doesn't like locking up years worth of payments on a sidechain?

What happens if post hard fork the new consensus determines the fork to be the 'right' bitcoin?
If 70% of the users, sites, miners all come to conclude that they will now call bcash bitcoin, then the system is working. If bad actors like Roger play dirty to get there, the system is still working as intended, meaning there is no central authority to over rule dirty tricks.
Then the 30% left are faced with the task of convincing the world that they are right, if they do so they win back the name.
It will be fun to see how it turns out and Roger is not playing to lose (despite him being a total douche).

The entire idea is based on consensus. If you fork bcash and can get exchanges and websites and users to take your side they can call your fork bitcoin.
No one controls bitcoin, there is no central authority to say 'this is bitcoin'. It is the masses that decide. You can try to appeal to authority but think for a moment if you want to give that power away.

The problem with these forks is they open you up to malware and or if you are not careful they can take your real bitcoins.
You need 3 PCs to do this with any sort of safety, one being a perma offline PC used to create bitcoin wallets offline cold storage.
You then send the bitcoins coins to a newly created cold storage wallet.
    
The old wallets private key with have the left over forked coins.
You then use the other PC that you never user for anything important at all ever ever, and DL a wallet that allows you to import and send the forked coins.
    
You send those coins to an exchange with that wallet, log into the exchange on your normal 3rd safe PC and sell them for litecoins, transfer those litecoins to coinbase, sell them for cash, and deposit the cash in the bank.
Reformat that 2nd PC

" In particular, each user has 14 open channels initially funded with 0.01 bitcoins. "
    
Did you read your own link?
    
They would have to spend $200ish in fees to open/load/join those 14 channels and another $200 to settle/close them if they have a balance left. They also would need $1800 to fund them.
I did not get further into the link.
    
10 million people would be 280 million tx on the blockchain and they are multisig so they are 30% larger so close to 400 million tx.
    
What if we have 20 million users? Ah thats right, we can't.

A 2mb increase would have cut the current mempool down to nothing. A 4mb increase might let us breath for 18 more months.
Neither would be a 10x increase time it takes to sync a full node.
The hard drive space costs less than 1 tx fee.
18 months sounds like a decent bit of room to allow segwit and LN to come on board.
Also it would crush the hopes and dreams of a certain person named Roger and that alone might make it worth it.

Essentially a paper wallet is/should be dead once you bring it online to spend it.
It is dead because you exposed the private key to an online machine, send the left over coins back to the cold storage address would completely defeat the idea of it being an air gapped offline cold storage wallet.
Meaning you start over with the left over bitcoin and have to move it to another new paper wallet like you did the first time.
    
It is why you really keep it for a long time in long term cold storage, due to it being a real pain and costly to do.

LN fails completely due to needing to be loaded from and settled on the main blockchain.
LN is dead for bitcoin except for exchange to exchange swaps maybe.
    
One way LN could help is the atomic swaps between coins, essentially creating a decent method for arbitrage, thus smoothing out markets but I think markets will still exist due to the nature of the need for micro second trading.
    
Segwit2x would get us from 4mb to 8mb in theory, the problem is the 14% adoption rate, not to mention miners have a say in all this and they are not fans now that things settled the way they did.

If you have 20 different addresses storing your coins and you want to spend them, you have to make a tx with 20 inputs and the 2 outputs.
Each of the 20 gets signed and that takes up space/bytes and costs more in fees.
This is supposed to make it so you only need the one sig to validate all 20 inputs, saving x number of bytes.
When it comes out could be another year along with another year for LN.
