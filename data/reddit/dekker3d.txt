If there's a &gt;35% chance that BitFinex will reimburse $1 per BFX token, it makes sense to buy them at $0.35 each. Same if there's a &gt;25% chance of $1 per token and another &gt;20% chance of &gt;$0.50 per token. As long as the average expected value is above $0.35 per token.

Torrents can be used for legit stuff, like downloading big files that you have a right to download. But most people see only the bad side. Bitcoin can be used for legit stuff, like paying people for innocent stuff. But the bankers will still try to paint it as terrorist money, as they have already done.

Looks pretty fascinating. 7 gbps mesh network? Gimme!
The ASIC is probably included for use with its own blockchain-type network, as they do discuss securing the thing with a blockchain somehow. It's probably an SHA ASIC, since Bitcoin is mentioned too. I'd guess it either has flash memory or can somehow be set to access your computers' storage via the network, as it does include StorJ support. Optionally but automatically selling your data sounds interesting.
... I think this could be neat, though it probably won't catch on enough for the mesh network functionality to work well. I do hope it works out though, I'd want one if it did.

It's not meant to. You send the btc, you send them back to yourself 10 minutes later. The transaction remains in the blockchain, showing what address you sent money from. Then, if you can sign anything with the private key that belongs to your original address (not the brainwallet, the one you actually used to send btc to it), you prove that you claimed that brainwallet user name first.

Well, you may just steal my vote away from the Pirate Party with this.
Bitcoin is mostly good for people because it puts banks and common people on somewhat equal footing again. If you want to send money somewhere and your bank won't let you, just withdraw your money and send it yourself. It's like cash in digital format, with all the pros and cons attached.
The biggest con, to any kind of politician, is that it'll be difficult to enforce taxes if people can find ways to hide their transactions. And given that many people in the Bitcoin community care about privacy, such methods spring up everywhere. You just have to trust people to actually -want- to pay taxes, which means you have to make them trust that their money will be well spent. Not exactly the approach the government has had until now.
Hell, the possibility that people may just not pay taxes over bitcoin transactions could lead to a form of democracy where you really vote with your money... a scary thought, given that some people have so much money, but it also means they'd actually be paying taxes like the rest of us if they want anything done in their favour.

Anyway, if you want to just enjoy the "omg they can't track me" feeling, sure.. that's enough. If you actually want to truly be hard to track, I'd suggest using mixing services or directly exchanging cryptocurrencies for other cryptocurrencies with people. And be careful what information you give to companies: they're much more likely to give that information to the authorities than any individual is, and the main reason one would want to be untrackable is because you don't want the government watching you for one reason or another.
Anyway, you're welcome, and I will. I've got quite a few bitcoins sitting around, just waiting until someone offers a lot of money for them :D

51% of miners would have to be mining on nodes that accept the unsigned transaction for it to work in the first place. Even THEN, whether it works also depends on people using nodes that accept the unsigned transactions. If I run a node that doesn't accept them, any bitcoin wallet connected to that node will just not give a shit and use the original blockchain without the unsigned transactions. It'd cause a fork, and anyone would use the non-tampered side of the fork by default because that's how the current software works. You'd pretty much need &gt;90% of all nodes to accept it, or at least the nodes used by companies like blockchain.info and other online wallet hosts.

You're HODLing it wrong. Is it an ipOhne?
@_date: 2014-10-26 21:29:39
It will happen, on average, once in every 4294967296 mistyped addresses, or about 4 * 10^9. As far as I can tell, there's only been 50 million transactions so far, or 5 * 10^7. This is from  and  seems to confirm that it's at least plausible.
According to this data, there would be a 1/80 chance that someone, at some point, managed to mistype an address in a way that the checksum still matched up, IF every single transaction ever included one mistyped attempt, which they don't. I think our definitions of "mistyped" are just different, it seems to be the most likely explanation.
Do you mean they copied the wrong address or something like that? Because for me, "mistyping" literally means only mistyping.

@_date: 2014-08-08 23:02:35
Pretty much. Miners currently limit block size so the blocks propagate faster. With that algorithm, blocks will propagate at the same (faster than current) speed regardless of size, so there's no more reason to limit the block size. And there IS a reason to stuff a block as full as possible: moar feeeees!

It may be wise to use a throwaway account if you openly state that you were mining that long ago. It does pretty much mean that you likely have a lot of bitcoin. If not back then, then maybe now due to its rise in value.

You can't speed up confirmations. The network is programmed to aim for 10 minute per confirmation rather than making it as fast as possible for a number of reasons, including bandwidth, storage space and probably some others. You also can't dedicate nodes toward speeding them up for specific addresses.
But yes, services like Bitpay can make this a lot easier for you. They handle it all and consider the transaction completed just seconds after it was sent. BIPS is an alternative worth mentioning too.

Not really. The 650 ti Boost, I presume it's a graphics card? Did you mine altcoins or Bitcoin? The latter would be kind of silly, given the massive competition out there. You'd need to be able to rival professional mass-mining companies out there to do well. Given that you can't produce your own ASICs, this is unlikely.

Melting metal into a shape requires a bit more energy than most 3d printing plastics do. There are low-temperature metals you could consider using, but most people would want to use the well-known metals with well-defined properties.. steel or aluminum. Which is hard.
Even if you built it yourself, you'd end up paying a few thousands of dollars just for the laser to melt the metal. Using a nozzle is pretty much out of the question due to the temperatures involved. At best you could just glue the metal together and put it in an oven to melt together, but.. yeah. It's not as simple as a normal plastic printer.
This ^ is the main reason that there aren't any good 3D printers that do metal, yet. There are some bad ones though, with awful resolution or other problems. I could look some up and link them if you want, but they won't help you do anything useful.

Quake Live doesn't allow user-run dedicated servers, which makes it unsuitable. Leetcoin needs a way to find out who killed who, and a reasonable certainty nobody will cheat.

Usually, your wallet will send the change from that 0.1 btc payment to a single other address in your wallet, not spreading it to all of them. Spreading would use more data, leading to higher fees.
If you send a transaction, the computer you send the transaction from will send it across the network. Other people on the network can detect your ip address. It's harder, but possible to also detect the ip address of the node that mined the block with that transaction in it, though you'd need to spend a lot of money to get enough nodes in the network to pull that off.
TOR works, it hides the address that you're sending the transaction from. It is not perfect, and there are people trying to snoop on Bitcoin traffic over TOR, with varied levels of success.

I respect your imho. Iyho? Eh. To me, ASICs are a somewhat bad thing because they cause mining to centralize more than GPUs or CPUs would. Anyone can buy a CPU or GPU if they have the money and live in a country with good access to tech. Buying an ASIC without getting screwed over is a lot harder, and it's less likely to be of use after its lifespan as a miner.

Sending address, receiving address and transaction output combined should make for a good unique identifier, since Mtgox can just make a new address for every outbound transaction. It'll take 10-60 mins longer to withdraw, but it works.
Faster way: get multiple hot wallet addresses, and just use the sending address, receiving address and transaction output again. Most transactions won't contain the exact same amount of bitcoins, and if they do, you can still send an amount of transactions equal to the number of hot wallet addresses you've got.

Others bought in at $200 and sold at $1000. It's a matter of luck or insight. The price fluctuations are unavoidable at the current, tiny market cap. If the price is higher, any individual trade will be a smaller part of the market cap so it will influence the price less.

From what I know, any random data can be a private key, and any combination of data + algorithm will make a public key that works with the private key.

Ignoring the silliness of keeping a block for days or weeks, each nonce has a certain "maximum difficulty" for which it is valid. For some, this maximum difficulty is low. For others, it is high. If the current difficulty rises, fewer nonces will meet this difficulty anymore.

Dogecoin is indeed an altcoin. The mining process is nearly identical, only differing in the mining algorithm (SHA-256 for Bitcoin, Scrypt for many altcoins). SHA-256 is much more effective using ASICs, so your GPU won't stand a chance of competing. A decent ATI graphics card could do well at mining altcoins with an algorithm other than SHA-256 or Scrypt though, because the other algorithms don't have ASICs yet. It seems like there's so many people mining them with their graphics card though, and so little money to mine per day, that even that isn't likely to be profitable.  is what I used to use before Scrypt ASICs appeared.

The 7 transactions thing is a result of the 1 mb block size limit. Miners were capping blocks lower than that, so increasing the block size wouldn't have helped. This directly increases the maximum number of transactions per second, in a way.

The part of the fork with the unsigned transactions wouldn't be continued without a 51% attack, so you DO need 51% of miners behind it. But if you have 90% of nodes, you would probably have 51% of miners mining on those nodes.

Well, the bitcoin fee will have to lower gradually as the price per bitcoin increases, or it'll become way too expensive. So if the price per bitcoin doubles in 4 years, while the block reward halves (due to reward halving) and the fees halve (due to bitcoin's price increasing), then we'll still have the same situation.
Bitcoin doubles in price faster than once every 4 years. So while the block reward gets lowered slowly, the fees lower quickly. Over time, the fees will be a SMALLER part of the total block reward, not a larger part of it. So, we should do something to incentivize filled blocks.

Well, SegWit uses anyone-can-spend transactions. If you want to undo it later, those transactions become spendable by anyone, despite formerly being SegWit transactions.
You could softfork again to deal with this, I'm sure, but another issue is that SegWit transactions will still be in the blocks that were mined while SegWit was active. You can't undo the transactions (you'd get an ETH/ETC style fork), you can't undo the blocks (same), so.. you have to keep them, and the logic to validate them, forever in your blockchain and codebase. At least until nearly every SegWit transaction has been used up in a regular transaction again to put it somewhere safe again.
So, it's practically impossible to cleanly undo SegWit once it has activated. The only thing you can really do is prevent more SegWit transactions from being accepted into blocks.
I think this is the most likely answer to "What can go wrong that cannot be corrected with an hard fork later?"

The blockchain is not completely immutable. If someone had more than 50% of the mining hashpower available, they could start mining new "alternate blocks" on top of old blocks, to invalidate the other blockchain built on top of those same old blocks. The bigger their share of the hashpower, the more likely this is.
If they had &gt;99% of hashpower, they could replace one old block per 10 minutes. At about 60%, it would take 50 minutes to replace one old block. At 51%, it would take about 500 minutes per block. This is all based on the assumption they don't just mess with the network in other ways instead.

Those soft forks had two advantages SegWit doesn't have:
1 - They fixed technical issues without affecting any politics. Nobody would've claimed that the version 0.8 database issue had any benefits. Many would consider a SegWit-less version of Bitcoin to have benefits over a version with SegWit, on the other hand.
2 - There were no competing solutions, like BU and SegWit being mutually exclusive right now unless you manually port SegWit into BU or port BU's blocksize stuff into Core.
@_date: 2014-07-26 15:54:31
You could implement it like this: blocks that are sent to other nodes are padded with the output of some hash function based on the nonce. The receiving node stores it without the hash output, but sends it to other nodes with the same hash output (because it can be generated again based on that same nonce). Any nodes owned by people who want fast transactions will only accept padded blocks, because accepting unpadded blocks means that the miners would soon start refusing most transactions again.
Storage requirements remains the same, propagation speed is suddenly the same for empty and full blocks due to padding, and the only downside is that bandwidth requirements increase as the maximum block size increases.
Increased bandwidth requirements seem to be a necessity for any padding technique, but storage requirements don't have to increase the same way.

Besides being shorter like elcheapo pointed out, it also means that Bitcoin is slightly resistant to quantum computing. As long as you haven't spent anything from a specific bitcoin address (easy, since you can just make a new address for every transaction), breaking the cryptography behind Bitcoin still wouldn't allow someone to steal your bitcoins simply because they can't reverse the hash as easily as they could break the encryption.

ASIC stands for Application-Specific Integrated Circuit. It's a chip like those found anywhere else, specifically made to mine cryptocurrency as efficiently as possible. There are SHA ASICs (for Bitcoin and early altcoins), and Scrypt ASICs (for newer altcoins like Litecoin and Dogecoin). An SHA ASIC is much more efficient than a graphics card, to the point where graphics card mining is utterly useless for any SHA-based cryptocurrency. Scrypt ASICs are a bit more efficient than graphics cards but in a rare situation you may still be able to profit from mining with a graphics card that you already have anyway (free power, high-end ATI card)
Most ASICs are devices that can be hooked up either via USB to a computer or via a network cable to your network. Either way, you'll need some software to set everything up but that's not too hard to learn.
You can use  to get an idea of profitability of any ASIC you see.
As an example,  does 3400 GH/s and would earn you about $15.38 per day mining Peercoin, an SHA-based altcoin.
Of that money, $4.56 would be used to pay for the 1900 watts it uses, if you pay $0.10 per kwh. You'd keep $10.82. But the difficulty will likely rise, so don't expect total profits to exceed more than 2-4 months' worth of mining unless you have free power. (That said, only 1/3rd of its earnings go back to power costs.. if Bitcoin's difficulty rises as slowly as it has since july, you could get 3 months' worth of profit out of it rather than 2-4)
That would be about $650-$1300, less than the machine is priced at. You can imagine why it hasn't been sold yet. Doing the math results in this guideline: don't pay more than $180 per 1000 GH/s (or $1 per 5.5 GH/s), and don't buy anything that uses more than 625 watts per 1000 GH/s.
Of course, this assumes the machine works perfectly and you can get it working at maximum speed. This requires skills and/or luck. Most of the above numbers assume some safety margins so you can get some profit out rather than only breaking even after a lot of effort.
Any brand-new ASICs will likely be used ("tested") at the manufacturer's place for a while until it's no longer going to earn back its costs in its lifetime at the original price, so second-hand is your best bet. And any second-hand offering is similarly going to cost more than it'll earn unless you find a great deal. This is why people say that Bitcoin mining is futile: unless you manufacture the ASICs, you're not going to profit.

By 2040, when 99% of all block reward coins have been distributed, bitcoin will likely either have failed, or become big enough that transaction fees become a significant reward for the miners.

If someone wanted to commit fraud within the Bitcoin network, and every block were just accepted, they could spam the blockchain with blocks that verify their fraudulent transactions (like double spending). Proof of work makes it so only one block is accepted per x minutes (10 mins for Bitcoin, less for most altcoins) and you'd have to be lucky 6 times in a row to confirm a fraudulent transaction. Or you'd have to get as much mining equipment as anyone else in the network, combined, for a 51% attack.
Long story short: it'd be hard to make such fraudulent transactions worth such a ridiculous investment, so one person won't easily be able to commit fraud inside the network.. that said, a pool can still use the mining power of a bunch of people to try the same, which is why we had the Ghash.io mess. They got too close to 50%.

@_date: 2015-01-14 22:34:09
So you're saying.. people use a bunch of old mining equipment and all the deactivated stuff to launch a 51% attack?
They could double spend. But it wouldn't be very feasible to try to get any real money that way, because no sane person would trade something valuable for bitcoins while there's obviously something fishy going on with the miners. And a 51% attack would be fairly obvious if launched in this way. Beside that, most of the old hardware is no longer used simply because its hashrate has become so incredibly low compared to the current state of the art. It's not just percentages, it's orders of magnitude. At least, that's what I recall about Bitcoin ASICs.
They could also temporarily reject specific transactions or all transactions. The uses of that are limited, though they could crash the price if you reject all transactions for a long time. That would cost a lot and you wouldn't see a return on investment for years.
Beyond double spending and rejection, there's not a lot they could do that an average Bitcoin client would accept as a valid block.

Basically this. The electricity cost of mining will always trend toward whatever your expected mining revenue will be. If there's too much of a profit margin, more miners will appear and cause difficulty to increase, reducing profit margins. If the margin goes away, the less-efficient miners will stop mining, reducing difficulty and increasing profit margins for the rest.

I think this attack doesn't work if 51% of miners use the same EB value, as some others have said. And miners would stand to lose a lot of money if they were attacked in this way, so they have a strong financial incentive to all agree on an EB value.
The main thing BU enables is for miners to change the EB value more easily, once they all agree to do so, because AD will prevent a fork from happening when the EB change across the network isn't completely synchronized.
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:55:28
You make a good point, but if even one exchange supports the non-SegWit chain (in addition to, or replacement of the SegWit chain), and it keeps enough value, your argument pretty much falls apart.
The non-SegWit coin will lose its value when people lose faith that it'll survive. The SegWit coin, on the other hand, will likely suffer massive reorgs which might tear down its value much faster.
Neither the SegWit chain nor the non-SegWit chain will be a sure thing, though the situation should resolve itself pretty quickly with one of the two losing all of its users in a matter of days or weeks.
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:00:41
After creating or receiving a new block, a moment of time is needed to verify transactions to put in the new block. It would be a waste to have your miners just idle during that time (and might be an issue with thermal expansion and such), so instead, the pool mines an empty block until it can actually verify and put together the transactions for the new block.
This process takes a few seconds, every ten minutes, so you'll see an empty block once in a while. The only two ways to avoid it is to either give up on profits (and collapse, as mining has small profit margins), or to make transaction verification take less time.
Both SegWit and the not-to-be-named alternative would reduce this transaction verification time and reduce those empty blocks, but right now empty blocks replace "no blocks" instead "full blocks".
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:29:28
Bitcoin would need to fork to something that can't be mined on an ASIC, to revert to GPU or CPU-based mining. When that happens, someone will create a new ASIC design that can mine with this new system. Then you need to fork again, to something new, to repeat the cycle.
If you can create any hardware that can mine a cryptocurrency, an ASIC will always be equal or better at it. Chances are high that it'll be better, which will drive up mining difficulty to the point where non-ASIC mining is once again futile.
Long story short: any proof-of-work based cryptocurrency that has existed for long enough and has enough of a block reward (or enough fees) will eventually be mined using ASICs. You'd need something else, but other methods have their own flaws.

The next hash could arrive in 1 second, 10 minutes or, sometimes, a tad longer than that. Still, the average time between blocks is 10 minutes (slightly less if hash power increases between difficulty adjustments), and it'll be on average about half a block time (5 minutes) since the last block when you submit your transaction. So, yes, your average first confirmation is in slightly-less-than-5-minutes, and any beyond that are slightly-less-than-10-minutes each.

Markets are sort of self-stabilizing. In many ways, if two people make use of the same opportunity, each one only gets half the profit they otherwise would've. So if you have a bot that makes a profit, it makes little sense to share it unless you can't make full use of the opportunities the bot finds for you, in which case it's only a matter of time until you have enough money that you -CAN- make full use of them.
So... open source bots will likely be experiments at best. Commercial bots will generally be a way for a company to get your money, for a product that wouldn't actually earn you anything. It's like in the gold rush, where they said the people selling the equipment were the ones getting rich.
The only way that makes sense, for you to get a trading bot that makes a profit, is to write one yourself. And that is tricky. I've been trying for a while.

Maybe all the commenters getting freaked out about how close we were to a hardfork due to all the SPV mining, has made the big blockers more excited about the possibility of a BU fork, and caused those on the fence to point their mining gear at BU pools. After all, a single lost block isn't that big a deal to a miner or mining pool. There have been 25 orphaned blocks in the past 75 days, or about one every three days.

"Child Pays For Parent" basically means that a mining pool will sometimes mine low-fee transactions that lead to high-fee transactions. If I send you 500 btc with no fee, it'll never arrive. If you then create a transaction that spends said 500 btc with a fee that pays enough for both, some pools will recognize that the second transaction will make up for the first, and include both in a block.

Wow.. I didn't expect my name to be on that list. I've never even noticed reed07 and Lixen, and.. "skiipy" only seems vaguely familiar. I wonder what methods were used to come up with this list. Going to read up on it some more.
skiipy and reed07 have written literally nothing about Bitcoin, in comments or posts. Lixen has plenty, and I do agree that his points and writing style are similar to mine, but I think he writes with a bit more confidence than I do, and about somewhat different things. Still cool that this algorithm managed to go "oh, these two are kind of similar, totally the same person fo sho".

That happens with orphan blocks all the time. The issue with a hardfork is that it splits permanently, rather than automatically resolving itself quickly.

The argument that it comes from deep in the earth and is millions of years old can also be applied to oil, coal and various ores. Chances are good that the carbon used for artificial diamond is also from coal, I'm guessing. Don't quote me on that though.

Miners do make their EB value known, from what I understand. A wallet can just compare incoming transactions to these values, and determine a risk factor. If needed, they can just wait it out. If the transaction doesn't get double-spent, it'll get into both sides after it's gone through the AD of the majority of nodes. If the transaction does get double-spent, no harm done as long as your wallet warned you to wait before considering it valid.
All of that would be utterly irrelevant with the 100 kB cap on individual transactions though. They should get that implemented.

@_date: 2016-12-02 14:41:41
Fair, but it's unlikely that the tx was that big by accident. A wallet could warn a user that they're creating massive transactions, and a company would be aware of the risk of big transactions. Beside that, BU caps individual transactions at 100 kB, I think.
So that's unlikely to be an issue.

To do that, you'd have to first create a block of the right size, and then do your double-spend in the time it takes to resolve the chain again. You'd need a lot of hashpower to do that reliably for the kind of transactions that have to arrive quickly (like face to face type stuff). A sensible miner will try to avoid mining on a split chain, so they will try to avoid splitting the chain in the first place.
You'd probably lose more money than you'd gain.
@_date: 2016-12-02 09:57:18
There would be two chains, one above 3 MB and one below. As soon as the one below gets ahead of the one above, all the miners start mining that one and the split is resolved. If not, and it goes on for 6 blocks, the first two groups' AD is hit and it'll start mining on the other chain, also resolving the split.
This would take 60 minutes, or about 1 hour. They'll have mostly the same transactions included, especially if there's no backlog. Reducing the backlog is the whole point of BU, so.. yeah. The average user would notice nothing, and companies might just consider transactions to be pending while there's more than one chain that has actively been mined on for the past 30 minutes.
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:08:30
They argue that SegWit might prevent further increases. I agree that it sounds silly at first glance, but Core doesn't seem interested in pursueing further on-chain scaling all that much. So the people who want bigger blocks will have to get around Core somehow.
Personally, though, I mostly care about the technical debt issue. Most programmers develop a near-instinctive aversion to needlessly complex code. I wouldn't mind SegWit as a hardfork, and softfork SegWit could be a way to get everyone to use an up-to-date client that's ready to adopt a later hardforked version of SegWit that's actually clean and simple, but the same issue pops up again: many people just don't trust Core anymore, and we all know Core is strongly against hardforks in the first place.
I agree that forks and migration are likely. I've been looking at other coins recently to see if migration was already happening, though that doesn't seem to have accelerated (it was already happening over the long term)

There's very little reason to use bitcoin internally for a company like Facebook. They'll always claim it's secure, because not doing that for a money transfer method would be silly. It's free because they already let you add money to your balance (for the micropayments on Facebook games) and can just remove some off your balance and add some to another user's balance if you want to send money. The only new thing, afaik, is that you can then withdraw it as money.. or not. Could be that you can simply pay for someone else to get play money on Facebook.

Yes, but miners would actively have to change back to non-Segwit2x mining for the confirmation period to fail. Right now it has 94% support. None of the miners have any real reason to switch back now. Some mining pools have hinted at changing back after SegWit locks in and before the hardfork does, that's all.

For those who already do shady stuff, Bitcoin doesn't change much. It's a tiny bit of convenience, but not the enabler everyone seems to see it as.

For those, like this guy, that want to -start- doing shady stuff... yeah, that's where Bitcoin makes things easier.

Lightning is a way to send payments instantly. Basically, you send a transaction for x BTC to an address and give whoever you're sending money to a transaction to move y BTC to himself and the rest back to you. If you want to send more, you give them a new transaction that is mutually exclusive with the last one and sends a bit more BTC to them. You also have a transaction signed by both of you that moves all of the BTC back to you after a certain amount of time, to make sure you're not locked out of your money.
FIBRE is a network to send blocks between nodes quickly. It's unrelated to Lightning, and doesn't even compete with it. I'm not sure whether it's for miners only, or will also be used for general nodes.

I was going to say "you can't just have the client tell the server about the surroundings, because that would allow cheating", but the exact same logic can be applied to GPS itself. Having the client tell the server that there's a lake x meters away and a street y meters away wouldn't let you do anything that much sillier.
Alternatively, you could use a middleware service: your app sends its surroundings data + gps to the middleware, gets back some kind of hashed data packet including all of the above minus gps location, and the app sends that to the server.. or the middleware sends it to the server directly. This would introduce 200 ms of lag and another point of failure, but for something like Pokemon Go's "wander around and find pokemon" gameplay, that's fine. And it shouldn't affect gym battles, the only realtime thing in the game right now.
Honestly, the former would be far simpler. But for either case, not having the GPS data would mean that the server can't adjust spawn rates per area, nor would it be able to show two players the same pokemon in the same location like it seems to do right now. A lot of the cooperative aspects would likely be lost, and that is really all that Pokemon Go has going for it right now.

Those "receiving addresses" are not rendered useless, afaik. It just keeps trying random secret keys until one generates a hashed public key that fits the expectations. The dozens of private keys are not saved, because they would have an infinitesimally small chance of ever being useful for "hacking" other accounts, and no bitcoins are put on those addresses either until one is found that fits the expectation.
Even an ASIC won't find a collision for a specific address anytime in our lifetimes using current hardware. If you fed it a list of all addresses that contain more than a certain amount of bitcoins, then maybe you might get results somewhere during the lifetime of this particular solar system.
^ I don't know the exact math here, but basically you're not going to get any results that way. There's just too many potential addresses, and they do not get "used up" the way you suggest.

The costs of mining are actually what makes bitcoin secure. Lowering those costs (mostly electricity costs) would lower bitcoin's security.
Anything that reduces the electricity cost would have to find an alternate way to prevent one party from gaining control over too much of the network. This would probably also have to be some form of constant cost. It'd have to use some resource other than electricity, or the computational device itself would have to be disposable and only capable of calculating a limited amount of hashes.

I love HappyCoins... when their site isn't telling me my account is less than a week old again, and I can't buy more than the minimum amount of coins. They offer low prices, related to the USD/XBT rate, rather than EUR/XBT, so occasionally I've actually bought bitcoins for LESS than the current rate in euro is.
I tried buying with Bitonic twice, but my bank prevented me from doing so because of "technical errors". I sold with them and got the money soon enough, and they're friendly folks on their IRC channel.
Bitplaats is slightly more expensive than Bitonic, having about twice as much spread. They do seem to have bitcoins when Bitonic doesn't, so that's nice. It's a good second option.
BTCDirect is about as expensive as Bitplaats, and I don't have as much experience with them. Bought with them once. It went through fine.
All four allow iDeal for buying (instant transfers from dutch bank accounts) and you get your coins in less than 5 minutes. Often less than 1. They also all seem to support SEPA for selling, so it should be smooth and cheap at any bank in a large part of europe.
