Oh... I thought you had a vector image

Coinbase can't be used from Romania. They say they don't support the geolocation... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:25:02
can you share the design?

I look at mining as an exchange where you convert your electricity bill into cryptocurrency.

i think it's called sarcasm in some parts of town
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:06:04
that bcc wallet looks so shady though... 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:28:57
Besides, getting hooked on the crypto game will make you lose nights on educating yourself and the excitement about every price movement.
@_date: 2017-08-07 13:44:48
What is pushing this price rise?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:16:15
we were expecting this
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:27:46
sarcastic comment accurately predicting price 
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:06:08
when its $100% up you expect it to go down a bit. Rinse and repeat

We can't know what doesn't work on your side of the pond. Try it and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:22:01
you forgot to add the cost of cooling solutions and the aditional power cost for that
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:18:12
It really depends on electricity cost and the cost on the hardware but even with fees it might be cheaper just to buy the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:35:03
trezor or ledger
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:31:28
Can I have the trezor then?
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:48:11
gonna need some sauce with that boss
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:53:36
It's too expensive to use. Exchanges here(Romania) are 5%+ over the major exchanges prices and there's aditional currency exchange commision and withdraw commision of 0.001BTC(4.59$ atm). Local bitcoins charge insane ammounts 10%+ over exchanges which is way too much for a little anonimity in my case. In this situation when you buy it you better make sure you don't spend it.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:45:09
whw.. those are some expensive cigs
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:16:42
the most resonating with your feelings*
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:15:55
How much are you loosing in fees(transfer and exchange)?
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:14:31
what about monero?
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:47:57
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:59:48
if you can use localbitcoins and it's your only option then use it and suck it up...
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:56:00
what if a goverment spends all the money on bitcoin without announcing it until after the deed is done. 
The citizens will probbly not know what they have and sell it cheap for usd/eur and the country will go bankrupt and some hodlers would buy it with bitcoin because that's the official currency.
sounds good.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:29:16
then buy off some friends
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:55:37
there's also Bitstone but it doesn't have anything to do with the coin
