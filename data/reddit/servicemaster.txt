Is credit even a thing anymore?

It blows my mind that enough is never enough when it comes to capital. I can barely make it month to month and I'll never even have the option of stealing enough just to survive,  let alone enough to buy a fucking car or luxury item.

So we need to show a vote was cast but not let it be known or traceable to the exact person? This is where I start to get confused as to how encryption works. I am not a programmer and I just assume there's a... riddle or equation that could easily solve this problem.
Also, I'm not looking for perfect. I'm looking for anything that's better than the current system of voting. As of right now, voting is at an all-time low in the US and I just don't understand how it could get any worse AND with how many other things we can do safely online, I just don't get why people keep telling me that we probably shouldn't vote online for very poor reasons.

Right, so Bitcoin gets to sit on top simply because it was first? Could bitcoin be the equivalent to Credits in Star Wars?

But can't anybody just go and make the same thing? I see other bitcoin-like digicurrencies.

To be honest, I keep thinking about the difference between Bitcoin and say World of Warcraft gold or Eve... dollars or even Steam Bucks which probably have a little more value than datayorbs. Couldn't these be a form of universal currency if Bitcoin can be?
Or should/could bitcoin represent the entirety of all online currency markets?

As true as that is, I don't see how it makes Bitcoin any less a scam, but more of an equalizing scam for the connected lower and middle classes.
Don't get me wrong, I am super interested in Bitcoin. But it's a lot of information to assimilate. I feel it may be a much needed step for a proper wealth redistribution (banksters ain't gonna give it up without a fight) so I can see this going a few ways, and it worries me that it might be before its time.
I know I'm not very influential, but a lot of diginerds are getting really excited about this digicurrency. I simply want to have a cautious optimism while being as skeptical as I can. So I might not be able to make Servybux, what's to stop Google from doing the same thing?
I probably won't be satisfied with most answers for a while, but thank you very much for your time. If you don't mind, I'd like to keep talking about this.

I am using this to end all of my arguments.
