The best defence here would be a killer use case that mandated bitcoins; by losing them to the state, the body politic cedes the benefit of that use case to states not practising confiscation. 
For example, *programmable money*. Bitcoins can be used to guarantee behaviour: "I'm a good guy and if I'm not, here's 1BTC from which to draw a penalty." This cannot be done with dollars. It would be suicidal to confiscate bitcoins in a world that expects such guarantees, and so, that much less likely.

\&gt;supply is suddenly restricted
The supply is not "suddenly" restricted, it halves every four years on an exact schedule. It has already halved three times before today. It will be approx 121 years before there is literally no more bitcoin to be mined.
In your baker's case, he will see volatility in the value of bitcoin in the present, so may eschew using it. In a hundred years time the quantity of bitcoin mined vs the quantity available as transaction fees will be far, far less so he would not expect a halvening (or indeed, the end of halvenings) to have a material impact because the value is so small.

Your problem is very likely your setup which a change to the repository has revealed, rather than a bug in the repo.
Logic: I've just installed homebrew fresh to my own machine and followed all directions through to discover both p2pkh (xpub) and p2wpkh (zpub) examples work as specified on that freedomnode page. I did not try the p2sh-p2wpkh example, the p2sh example gave me a different error to yours.
I'll note that:
* I'm using macOS 10.13.6
* homebrew has never been on this machine before today and was installed as per [
* I followed [ to clean up things, even though I'm not on Mojave
* I also followed [ in order to resolve an ext-gmp problem I had at "composer require bitwasp/bitcoin"
* I specifically installed php as per the freedomnode page, though later versions are available
* Everything else was installed to latest version
* I used Electrum 3.3.4, also latest version to generate addresses - they worked, as did the freedomenode address for the p2pkh  example
Before I go further I'll note that while I have programmed in PHP professionally, off and on, since the late 90s, I'm not a homebrew specialist. That said, that I can't replicate on a fresh set-up what you found reeks of a configuration hygiene issue - perhaps you have old copies of something hanging around affecting things.
My next step as you would be to completely remove homebrew etc and rebuild it from scratch - only you can know how keen you are to do that. I didn't look into how that can happen, it's something I'd guess these guys: [ should know more about.

[Fidelity Bonds]( were thought to point the way towards this kind of gatekeeping back then, but they look comparatively flawed to me: you are destroying satoshis to 'buy' an identity. What really makes it plausible onchain are P2SH addresses where a smart contract can be written to accomplish the same goal. Fees are of course higher onchain, but high value transactions such as security deposits are exactly the same kind of transaction - so I propose to start there. What it would take to implement over Lightning has yet to be seen!

Rather than Yet Another Wallet, I'm thinking instead of SMTP/POP3/IMAP where, if you know the hostname/username/password, your device - no matter how low powered - is able to access the email network. I suggest a similar server running on the Pi where hostname/credentials gains your device access to crypto network(s) through the Pi's wallet, without needing any crypto facilities on your device. This Pi/server would interact with LN, for example, through LN's [gRPC API]( Implementing drivers would be appropriate to add additional crypto networks to such a server, were that desirable. The server itself would arrange much more granular security (such as limiting how much crypto can be used for what purpose) as well as seeking 2FA approval for any transfers off it. 
In a PoS environment, your PoS machines would connect to that crypto-server to conduct business, so wouldn't need individual wallets. Which is also safer, as the crypto-server could be locked up. 
In my example from the OP, I'm thinking those willing to pay would be able to connect - with credentials - back to their own crypto-server to arrange payment to yours, in the same way they connect with credentials back to their own email server to email you.
The reason I ask is not because everyone would pay - I think only where the alternative is be price-gouged would people pay - but that I'm tinkering with what micropayment problems could be solved this way.
I much appreciate your comments!

Simple enough by providing a few packets of data, free - enough to make a payment, not enough to do much damage.
Or: create a new protocol. I am Alice, my wallet can be found at IP address B, if you ask it for amount C, using this data D it will be honoured. Alice's wallet - at her home address - checks D, honours C. Your router noting that C has arrived, approves the connection. Alice now has a route without herself having had bandwidth beyond your access point.
This seems simple enough to implement using a hash: you tell Alice your address L for payments, and your payment requirement P. Alice shares a secret S with her wallet. Alice can form hash H1 from hash(L, P, S). Your router could give L, P and H1 to her wallet on her network and it can establish H2 = hash(L, P, S). If H1 == H2, then you must have received H1, and thus gained approval for L and P, from Alice.

I can't imagine where we know each other from - I don't recognise your name. Maybe DM me your real one?
Anyway. It's unwise to focus on the tx/sec, IMHO. This is not a race, it's a build-out: we may one day be Visa's competitor, but they will never be ours. The BTC approach has been about *development layers*, mirroring that Internet Protocol existed before Transmission Control Protocol, and both needed settling before HTTP, which then supported HTTPS. Development layers are how I was brought up as a programmer.
There are two approaches to bringing up the overall transactions: the first is "Big Blocks" which has it's own adherents over with BCH. However Big Blocks do not *layer* well - all the work is going towards their Layer 1. What are the ramifications of Big Blocks? How much extra would someone have to spend keeping up with it? What is prevented from happening because of it?
The other approach is Layer 2. Nothing (or very little) changes with Layer 1 which should increase base level safety, reliability and predictability. All the risk then forms on Layer 2, so if it turns out to be wrong, BTC is unaffected.
My opinion is that BCH serves a purpose quickly demonstrating a cash-like behaviour from a crypto which can be thought of as driving interest. BTC has no need to demonstrate cash-like behaviour just yet - that's Layer 2s job. My opinion is that BTC, being layered, will soon enough support a much wider, much faster, much safer, much more private, system. My opinion is that blocksize increases should wait until we see what Layer 2 can do.

|time enough to send a payment
That's an excellent point. Thinking out loud: the device connects and asks for a route, the box says I need a payment, the device says "I need access to X to do it" and on that basis, the Pi allows traffic to X for a short period (say, Y seconds, using no more than Z kilobytes.) The payment having been made and confirmed over LN, the Pi then allows further access. If payment is not made, the connecting device is blocked for a while. I'm thinking these could be implemented using tc and iptables from iproute2 in Linux. I'm further thinking that the payment could be originated from the box, not the device ("Please ask X for the details you need"), further securing things.
You're absolutely right that prices would tend to zero, and rightfully so! Until they do, I'm thinking people could take a slice out of ISPs who are price-gouging.

All the time!
I've learned this is a general problem with journalism - very, very few journalists in *any* field have much more than the slightest idea. I learned this listening to healthcare workers complaining of obvious (to them) errors in reporting, teachers doing likewise. It came totally clear when a conversation I had with one was badly misunderstood by the time it got into print. Why are they not experts? It's unlikely that a Theymos or a Peter Todd would write the story, and undesirable too -experts are for us better employed elsewhere.
The clue is in the name: *journal*ism and not *expert*ism. Journalists record observations into a journal. About all the wise person can take away is that something (that may or not be what was described) happened at some point (that may or may not be when reported) and it affected person X in 'this' way - but might have been that way. And the fact something else wasn't reported may well be because simply a journalist hasn't yet discovered the story.

How much would such a back door be worth to sell on the darknet? $1000? $10 million? Any address storing less than that sum must be safe because they’d make more some other way. 
Now consider that as soon as they withdraw the bitcoins, everyone knows that someone, somewhere, has that capacity. The fiat value of a bitcoin drops to zero - so now not only can they not make any money, they’ve effectively shutdown any possibility of making more money by doing it twice. 
NB. Edge cases have an outside possibility of making small sums for a short period of time, but the more they do it the more likely they’ll be revealed as above.

BTC is $150b in size. There's no reason to think that the BCH halvening (even assuming it'll have an impact, PlanB says shitcoins don't) will have any impact other than on sentiment.

Speaking historically they're not far wrong; and neither is OP.
Would it be correct to say "The Internet IS the killer app"? Yes it would: it's now unconscionable for an authority to shut down the Internet in any situation short of war: contrast that the Turks have done exactly that to the unhappy Kurdish but the Chinese, facing extraordinary civil defiance, have not dared - at least not yet. 
What, yet, about Bitcoin makes it unconscionable to prohibit? Whether they can or not is a different question. Much of Northern Africa outright prohibits Bitcoin. What is the *killer app* that would make them 180 degrees and legalize it? What use is there of it that would be better for these countries than simply banning it, then seizing any found for their own purpose?
At this time there is no such killer app, and "Bitcoin IS the killer app" is demonstrably insufficient to induce legalisation. That Killer App has yet to be seen, and that's how we all know that these days are still incredibly early.

It wouldn't work because there is not a "shit ton" of Bitcoin available to be bought. While they could print $10,000 (or w/e) and buy one, the second one they want to buy would cost a little bit more because that's how order books work. By the time they got to the 500th Bitcoin, everyone has noticed - and it doesn't cost $10,000 any more, it costs $11,000. And the same all the way up - every successive Bitcoin purchased is more expensive than the last. Want 200,000 of them? The printing has now driven the price waaaay up.

A program on your computer, like Microsoft Word or Doom, iTunes and Google Chrome are all essentially a series of instructions that describe what should happen, when: what should happen when a key is pressed, what should show up on screen.
Bitcoin Script is similar, describing two things: first, it describes what conditions are necessary to spend a certain bitcoin. For instance "This coin may only be spent by someone with private key N". Second, it describes what right you claim to spend it. For instance "I have private key N". A miner sees that script and runs it: instead of writing a resume or exploding a hell demon, he gets a transaction out of a valid script. That transaction is now ready to enter the Blockchain.
The script needn't only be as described above, it can be much more complicated. For instance, the owner of the coin can say "This Bitcoin cannot be spent before 1st February 2022". The example above is pay to keyhash (p2kh). The example just now is another type, pay to script hash (p2sh). 
You're absolutely right that it's too complicated for non-techies, which is why most prefer a wallet to handle the details for them.

A good point, so let's work with it.
Printed money is used to buy up the order book at an OTC market, which then runs dry. Insiders know what's going on and buy up every coin they can find at other OTC markets, and in the open market. Within an hour other clients at the original OTC market realise that they've gone dry and start doing the same. Within hours the other OTC markets realise what's going on - but there are no more OTC markets - they're all dry - only the open market. Now, all of the OTC market participants are clamouring at the exchanges for whatever BTC is available, and the published price starts going up. In your scenario, the printed cash doesn't move the price immediately, but keep printing, keep buying, and it inevitably, and quickly, will.

Imagine a town with one shop and one customer, you. The shop pays you $10 a day to stock the shelves, and you pay the shop a different $10 each day for groceries. Instead of you both actually swapping the two $10 notes at the end of each day, you both just keep your own note and consider it settled. 
This is called "Cancelling out" and is how a single transaction works on Lightning: you put $100 up, and as you buy stuff it get's cancelled out to the shopkeeper's benefit. As you're paid, your $100 gets reloaded from the shopkeeper's account. No notes actually change hands.
Now say you want to pay someone $40 to clean your car. Instead of paying them directly, Lightning *Network* means that they can get the $40 from the $100 you set up with the store. They now have $40 they can use at the store, and you have a clean car. Again, no actual money has had to change hands.
Money changing hands is what happens when something is added to the Blockchain. But just as there's a cost to handing over dollar notes (you gotta find it, they gotta check it) there's a cost in fees to add to the Blockchain. 
This cancelling out means just as you can save the time actually swapping notes, on the Blockchain you can save almost all the fees.

What would happen is the fees would rise because of the lost block reward, and the change would be enough to secure the network.
Logic: unexpectedly losing the block reward leaves miners out of pocket when it comes to paying their bills. Some would go out of business, which potentially reduces the hash rate and thus the security of the network. This makes it cheaper and so allow older mining equipment to be pressed back into use. However the miners that are left now know that there's no block reward and so cherry pick only the highest value transactions for mining. In order to get onto the blockchain, users now know they have to submit higher fees ... and that's what they do. Fees rise, mining profitability stabilises, the network security likewise stabilises too.
@_date: 2019-04-22 12:32:40
Now read.
If I'm reading it correctly, in an undercutting attack an attacker will still need to maximise transaction fees to at least the point they can pay their bills, but once done, will seek to leave as much as possible 'on the table'.
This would disadvantage high-fee tx in favour of low-fee tx. Logically, attacker interest in maintaining the Bitcoin economy would see them favour larger blocks to fill with low-fee tx to benefit the widest number of participants.
Thanks again for that food for thought!

What defines a 'hoard' and so what constitutes a 'larger hoard' than 'typical savings' is something that would have to be decided by someone, or some group. That's centralisation, which is anathema in Bitcoin.
The kind of problems you'll face include: what's a hoard? Money unspent for a year? What about people putting money aside against children? Ok, money unspent for twenty years. But what then about putting money aside against infirmity? Well then, define a hoard as four times as much money as the average person earns in a life. But then a Madagascaran who can expect $32k in his life, and a Monocoan might expect a thousand time more. What about ill health? That can rapidly take you over the limit. How about 200x as much money as the average person needs? Now you have to answer - what about villages of 51 people that combine their resources and so go over that new limit? So now you need a regulator to certify an exemption. What a mess.

What an interesting question!
I'll rephrase the bit I like: Given onchain payments get less economic the smaller they are, do Lightning payments get less economic the larger they are, and what happens if the minimum for one becomes larger than the maximum for the other?
I do not count myself as a Lightning expert but I'll take a shot at that. On the one hand Lightning payments do not get "less economic" simply for being larger - if Alice and Bob have a million Bitcoin lightning channel between them, they can instantly transfer a million Bitcoin between them for no additional cost.
However Lighting payments do get \*more difficult\* the larger the payments are if there are intermediaries. LN has a capacity today of 1046 btc so a 2000 btc transfer might be waiting a long time. For smaller payments, each intermediate along the route has to have the whole of the value being transferred, so if Alice sends 100 btc to Carol via Bob, Bob has to have 100 btc available. It seems logical to think there are fewer routes to transfer 100btc than there to transfer 0.1btc, and so be more difficult to make that connection.
We can rewrite the original question then: what happens if a Lightning payment gets more difficult than the onchain payment is economic?
That's now a personal question rather than a technical one. One temporary solution might be to break the one big LN payment into ten smaller LN payments so reducing the difficulty (although increasing the risk.)

The block reward is actually in satoshis. By convention we refer to 100,000,000 satoshis as 1 bitcoin. Thus when we say that at the moment the block reward is 12.5 bitcoins, it's internally handled as ~~12,500,000,000~~ 1,250,000,000 satoshis (thanks When I refer to the last WHOLE bitcoin being mined in 2032, that's because the block reward will change from 1.56250000 bitcoins (which is 156,250,000 satoshis) to 0.78125000 bitcoins -- which is 78,125,000 satoshis.

Bitcoin fees are actually the difference between the total of the inputs and the value expected to arrive, and may *or may not* bear any relation to the number of inputs. That is, you could offer virtually nothing to collect all these little inputs, or you could offer a lot. Different wallets may endeavour to suggest an appropriate fee, but following them is not mandatory.
The new paper address will be one output when you come to spend it - all the inputs in the previous transaction become joined up. Kind of like getting a dollar in change from the last four stores you visited, when you go to the next store, you've got four dollars in your one pocket.

Transactions waiting to enter the blockchain wait for a block in the mempool; when a transaction enters the block and that block enters the blockchain, it's removed from the mempool.

According to my back of the envelope calculation, mining hardware that became inefficient within the last 15 months is now efficient to turn on again: while they're half as likely to find a block, fees doubling makes it just as rewarding when they do.
Now consider that's not the only feedback mechanism: halving the hashrate is likely to bump the price of a bitcoin: those who want to buy, cannot, because fewer of them are being mined (same scenario as the halvening.) Now, access to coinbase coins as well adds even more incentive to mine until the next difficult adjustment.

Paper Gold is far more than just a gold ETF, it includes gold stocks, depository notes, futures and others similarly 'not backed'. However your point does stand.
Your answer is that an ETF is positive for both price level, and price stability:
Price level: An honest ETF will generally seek to hold "physical" bitcoin in order to match the bitcoin price. That is, such an ETF will have to buy bitcoins at market price - and that would tend to see bitcoin prices move higher as demand exceeds supply.
Price stabilty: ETFs cast the net further still of who can buy in, and how - and a wider, deeper market is thought good for price stability otherwise the European Single Market wouldn't have got off the ground.

It isn't at all true, and here's why. Assuming Xi orders Bitcoin miners closed down:
1. The Chinese government will not act against miners not in China, any more than they'd wander around Boca Raton tax collecting - and for the same reason - leaving Bitcoin unaffected;
2. Some named person will be in charge of the effort, with lesser names in more local areas. Chinese functionaries can be considered every bit as corrupt and venal as their Western counterparts. With access to the right club over there, and an envelope full of cash over here, the shutdown order will not be applied everywhere leaving miners with swing untouched;
3. Not all electricity sources are metered - miners that use them could not be found from the center. And for those which are metered, generator staff are able to accidentally disconnect those meters, or filter their results, leaving miners with untouched connections;
4. Even if all the miners in China shutdown it will not take long for the mining equipment to turn up and be switched on in some other country leaving the hash rate essentially unchanged; 
5. If every Chinese citizen refused to use Bitcoin, they would quickly find themselves at a severe disadvantage to their contemporaries elsewhere. This is still many years out, I grant you. 
Bitcoin doesn't have a kill switch.

Miners receive 12.5 bitcoins for each block they mine, the halvening means they'll receive only 6.25 bitcoins instead. They are thought to immediately sell those into the market in order to cover their electricity and other costs. This is thought to suppress the price as it means bitcoins are available for sale, whatever the price and regardless of demand.
Fewer bitcoins mined -&gt; less suppression of the price -&gt; price goes up. That's the theory. The reality is a tad more complex.

Big, if true.
The story of [Galileo Galilei]( is instructive: By 1633 he was sentenced to house arrest for the heresy of proposing the Earth goes round the Sun, and not vice versa.
It took the Catholic Church 189 years to accept he was right. It took the Catholic Church 359 years to apologise for bringing the case at all.

The "close" being considered is not the close of the market (even though that's what it's called) but more accurately a close of a *period* be it hourly, daily, weekly etc.
Different markets use different periods (sun-sat, mon-sun, mon-fri) so you will need to check with the market you're trading what period they use.

Your point is reasonable, and deserves a serious answer.
Consider Bitcoin in the abstract (ie, please take these as general observations about blockchains, not as statements of technical fact about Bitcoin.) If you're condensing the timestamp you could go even further by storing just the difference between the timestamp now and the timestamp in the last block: that is, storing just "600" for the 10 minutes * 60 seconds difference. That's a saving of seven characters for every timestamp, right?
Here's the problem: you are forcing a trade-off. By compressing timestamps you are *adding* code to bitcoind, code intended to compress/decompress. That introduces potential bugs, so the trade-off may compromise security.
It makes the code slower as your compress/decompress routines are processed, potentially meaning an attack is easier as messages pass more slowly between nodes. In my example of storing the difference, to calculate the time of the current block one would start from the genesis block and adding the differences for each of 576,367 (so far) later blocks. To be fair there are ways around that, but none of them as fast as simply storing the timestamp. So the speed of communication in the network would have to fall.
Let's imagine timestamps are 10% of the blockchain. They're nowhere near but for the sake of argument, assume it true. If the blockchain is 255Gb that means your saving will save the average full node $6.25 in disk space (in 2017 diskspace was 2.5 US cents per Gb.) That's 25.5Gb - you can't even buy drives that small any more. Thus, the improvement doesn't save any money. 
The biggest idea for reducing the blockchain filesize is [pruning](

It will feel like enslavement to some, even if it isn't: American living standards are artificially high because of the dollar's [exorbitant privilege]( A general move from dollars to BTC could indirectly undermine that. Suddenly: all those printed dollars return from abroad and would need to be redeemed in Goods, Services, or bitcoins. Gasoline prices head up affecting drivers, welfare recipients get even harder hit, there will be less need for a military at the very moment there'll be less money to pay for it. Anyone on the wrong side of that move will feel 'enslaved' just as some feel 'enslaved' by the dollar.
It's arguable whether the above could happen (I would say it would not, any time soon) but there is an upside. Anyone with debts in dollars would see that debt wiped out.

"Intrinsic value is the perceived or calculated value of a company, including tangible and intangible factors, using fundamental analysis." [source](
There is a very specific meaning to "intrinsic value" being used, and those sceptics are using that specific meaning. Importantly, the meaning does not follow your assumption.
As fundamental analysis doesn't know how to deal with Bitcoin, it would be more honest for the sceptics to say "We don't know how to calculate Bitcoin's intrinsic value."
As they're at a loss how to apply what they know, if I read such an article I would move on rather than second guess what a blind man thinks about what he can't see.

What you're describing is how Paypal was originally envisaged - an online currency for the world. It's very likely how facebook-coin will be marketed too. They are all, essentially, pegged to the dollar (pound, euro etc) with the intention of being faster, more convenient versions of them. 
However they will suffer from the same problems as fiat (inflation and NIRP being two) as well as bringing a new set of problems (eg, centralized, arbitrary seizure.)
It won't take people long to realise that if you have an Amazon-coin or Facebook-coin you aren't using, you should sell it for something that has a better risk profile. Even fiat has that profile.
You might like to look into PayPal's many, many problems over the years, particularly how few people want to hold anything with them for any length of time. That's their future.

Also no: a cold wallet is when the private key is not accessible online. Where the public key is, is irrelevant. The private key can be on a computer, *as long as the computer is not online*. It can be written on paper, edited in a text file on an SD card or hammered into steel panels ... as long as it cannot be accessed online - as a file, or a webcam opposite your steel panel, etc.
Some online sites that generate cold wallets are not actually "online", but are javascript running in your browser such that an *offline* computer running it can create the wallet thus assuring that your computer is not leaking the data out. Ideally too, this would be a computer running off a CD. 
The point of a cold wallet is that there's no feasible method by which online action results in the private key being found.

Google/Apple could only 'ban' *bitcoin on their respective platforms.*
They would resist this: it would cost Google/Apple money - rather than the taxpayer - to police what counts as a banned app, and arrange for it to be prohibited. Further, it would be difficult to control access via a 3rd party. For example, by using a browser to access a bitcoin website. While it's easy to ban the website, it's easier to recreate it anew. Studying what's happened with The Pirate Bay would inform readers how it's likely to happen, and how ineffective it has been.

There'll always be *some* power, even if it [comes from humans]( 
If aliens land and make a convincing case that Electricity will become 1000x less abundant after new years day, you can probably expect two blockchains in short order, the first mined as currently, and the second shadow one mined with a 1000x less difficulty but continually extending the first chain until New years day after which it becomes the 'official' blockchain - and we're back to where we are now.
If you mean a cyber attack taking America (or China, 
or region) offline for who knows how long, Bitcoin will chug along just fine. If it look like mining would be significantly affected (Lets define that as "blocks average 100x too long") an emergency fork could probably be agreed. When your country/region rejoins the rest of the world, your bitcoins will be exactly where you left them. If you are within the region, but cut off, you may well find a local ledger springs up to be settled later - just as happened to US towns cut off for months at a time over 18th-19th century winters.
If you mean the entire world permanently cut off from electricity, well ... you're gonna have bigger problems than Bitcoin to worry about.

No, because for the same level of activity fewer transactions will appear on the blockchain.
Yes, because at a much higher level of activity, just as many transactions will appear on the blockchain as back then, and so transaction cost can be expected to rise to match.
