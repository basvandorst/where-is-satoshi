Agree with your frustration, I'd love to launch *all the security* right now, but we prioritize based on risks and exploitation. There are much more active attacks that require attention than compromised certificate authorities.


Yes. But you are now describing a compromised CA scenario. We agree that's a problem. Sometimes CA's get compromised, and SSL pinning helps mitigate that. 
However, your argument thus far has been that we are not validating certificates *at all* (your initial claim to us which you've corrected as erronous) and that SSL Pinning somehow defends against malware and local modification of CA's, which it doesn't, at all, and no one would ever agree with.


Client_ID and Client_Secret (in our app and by our design) are not even considered a line of defense, as I keep saying. They are not used for any form of authentication. They're useless in any attack. If you can create a proof of concept that proves otherwise, I have a bounty waiting for you.

Ryan from Coinbase here. Thanks for taking the time to work with us, and I wanted to make a few points about your post. 
Here’s the disclosure thread between us and Brian: 


You’re right, we do not yet have SSL pinning launched on our android app. However, on android, it is NOT easy to install another certificate authority unless the device is rooted and malware is installed (or you modify it yourself, as you have been doing). Your threat scenario describes a totally owned android device with a **locally modified CA**, which has much bigger risks than CA tampering. This was clearly described on the HackerOne thread. 
We do view SSL pinning as something worth having on our roadmap, but we've been working on bigger wins like Device Verification in the meantime, which has done great things against phishing attacks, which has been a much more frequent and probable threat compared to total CA compromises. Remember, remote CA compromises are the threat model for SSL pinning, not local compromise which is a malware issue.


As we described, despite these tokens being technically called secrets, these tokens are NOT designed in our app to be secret and have not been granted any extra permission to perform any additional action on our product. We’re aware that they’re published on Github and do not believe this to be a security risk. We also mentioned this in the HackerOne thread. These are literally only trusted for some level of basic metrics. If you have found otherwise, _then_ we're talking.
“Once the attacker has beaten the SSL connection, they can view the access_token.”
You’ve MITM’d yourself, so of course it will be visible.

Where did you play?

Hi, author here!
This is an informal project. It started out as my own personal list of BTC incident post-mortems (or the nearest replacement). I wanted an easy reference to easily point out how often existential security breaches have impacted cryptocurrency companies.
**The title**: The "graveyard" term plays off the security "post-mortem" in DFIR, since post-mortem is mostly about dead people outside of security. It just obviously happens to be that most of these entries are defunct. 
I also have to mention that part of my inspiration for this was to get a sweet 99Designs logo on something, but I didn't have a sexy vulnerability to publish. :(
This is a Jekyll site on GH pages, so submit a PR if you see an error or want a new breach added, as long as it sticks to the similar types of incidents up there.
Enjoy
