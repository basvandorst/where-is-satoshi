As one of the goxxed, I welcome the adoption of decentralized exchanges. I've eyed the space for a while and, call me a shill, but I'm very impressed with Blocknet. It is currently undergoing stress testing. They are launching beta on March 1. I look forward to utilizing DEX's exclusively.

How is Hal not perfectly deserving of the title?

Delerium just confirmed in irc that this user is fake:

Can you or a source comment on the status of the coins? Lost? Stolen? Trying to be recovered? The "Full Story" would include this information.
@_date: 2014-02-07 07:48:26
Yes, but there is a processing delay of two weeks.
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:28:57
Who are you and how do you know this?
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:49:12
Someone posted it in an irc. Then someone else said it was an old leak from 2011. I didn't want anyone to worry if it was unnecessary so I deleted the post. I replaced it after because I figured people should know if this happened regardless.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:04:44
Will you comment on this?:
   
   
Is this theory anywhere near correct, and if so, are the BTC still potentially recoverable?
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:22:37
The transactions are instantaneous, it's just that the withdrawal/exchange servers are located in space, ~1 light-week away. Therefore the turn around trip takes two weeks. If you have an issue, you can take it up with the speed of light and the laws of the natural universe and not our perfectly functioning exchange. Incidentally, the deposit servers are located right here on Earth so we can accept your funds as quickly as possible.

I think you're missing the point. He isn't going to be paying a stranger anything. It's just a dramatic way to assert that he really didn't sign the contract.

Agreed. Gridcoin.

it is absolutely trading on kraken

Perhaps we are just talking semantics I suppose. I would still say unprecedented due to how bitcoin is treated or not treated as an asset (it is not considered property) and the massive gains in the asset. Japan’s legal system is faltering here. We have hired attorneys and are pursuing options, of which, Civil Rehabilitation seems the best avenue.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:31:13
One thing we can certainly agree on is that I honestly have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:14:56
Thank you for always disclosing what you can. It is very appreciated.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:10:54
You are equating regulated securities and commodities with bitcoin and Gox. The law does not see it that way, although there have been some recent changes.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:14:44
In Japan, the value of your bankruptcy claim is established at the beginning. Even if the value goes up, you are only entitled to that initial amount per the law written as is. Despite the fact the all creditors could now be made whole (they won't) all surplus funds go to the shareholders of the company. Normally, even if an asset has increased in value, it is nowhere near the amount of increase which we have seen in bitcoin, where the amount insane. So the perpetrator  gains wealth beyond his wildest dreams, and the creditors are left with a fraction of their debt repaid. I don't see why you are arguing **for** this.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:18:11
This is extremely ignorant.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:15:44
I know but that is referring to the 202K BTC that were found later on.
@_date: 2015-08-30 01:57:40
@_date: 2015-08-01 14:57:11
Source for him claiming 200k never existed?
@_date: 2015-08-04 13:44:55
Hey now that Mark has been arrested, is there anything else you can let us in on? Has Deloitte completed their assessment of the exchange data? And is it possible that many of the "missing" coins never even existed?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:17:09
Why does it matter if the surplus value that goes to him is in bitcoin or yen or sand dollars? The whole current process is simply unjust. We are trying to rectify that. Additionally, Civil Rehabilitation could rapidly expedite things, which is something I think everyone can get behind. I think we'd all like it to be over.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:06:05
There is some misunderstanding here. I’m not talking about Mark holding coins. He will be the beneficiary of the gain in bitcoin’s value, which could afford to make all creditors whole. This will not happen and we are restricted to having ~25% returned. So he gets wealthy and we don’t even get made whole.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:46:29
That’s how bankruptcy works in Japan. The court adheres strictly to the law and views no other option. We’re working on it. If we can get enough eyes on this we may be able to switch over to Civil Rehabilitation where a sponsor could assume control of Gox’s assets and distribute them more fairly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:42:36
The case is unprecedented, so the laws aren't built to handle such a thing as bitcoin. Go ahead, find me an example of anything remotely similar happening in Japanese bankruptcy history. Some new considerations are in order. The trustee, however, only sees black and white.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:39:51
If a large portion of the missing coins were fake, that means the remaining 202K BTC constitute a much larger portion of the lost funds, and therefore all of us goxxed will be getting higher payouts.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:44:57
The creditors are limited to receiving a % of the value of their claim **at the time Gox entered bankruptcy**. They are not made whole, and the surplus value from the increase in Bitcoin's price since then goes to Mark. Seem right to you?
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:59:40
I thought Armstrong tweeted he was in for LTC. Did I miss something?
@_date: 2016-02-16 20:44:10
has been pretty phenomenal about communicating all he can. I imagine he'll be getting filled in via tomorrow's creditor's meeting and update us on the on-goings as soon as possible.
*edit: It is currently almost 3pm CST for me. Looks like the meeting will take place in only about 7.5 hrs.

@_date: 2015-04-22 17:09:44
I'd like to know this too. can you share what percentage of the lost funds were Gox assets? Now that they are in bankruptcy those should be distributed to creditors as well, lessening the 850K obligation and further increasing payouts correct?
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:39:03
+1 for LTC
