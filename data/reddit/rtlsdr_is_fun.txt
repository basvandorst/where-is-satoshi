Yes, my argument does count any ad, but in reality a small image like reddit uses, or Google text ads are fine. My argument is against autoplaying TV commercials embedded in webpages.

I don't have a 2gb cap (on my home internet), it is an example. Mobile video ads are on the rise too so the example remains.
The whole point kind of shifted to "lets get rid of data caps", but think of it this way. Ads are EVERYWHERE. Imagine if CPU sucking scripts were too.
Would you still defend your stance if everyone ran TidBit? You don't like it so you go elsewhere, but EVERYONE has it (remember, in this scenario it is as widespread as ads are now). So where will go you?
You may argue that current advertising isn't stealing, just like I argue that it isn't stealing when I modify the content coming through my network to remove said ads.
Hopefully we could both agree that a widespread 100% cpu script would be a bad thing for the web. That was my original point.

Pretty much the same thing I used to use DVD-R for but more space. DVD-DL is alright, but more suspect to post-burn damage (aka scratching) than BD-R, and BD-R holds over twice the data for nearly the same cost. (Compared to [Newegg's 30 SL BD-R for $29.99]( (not sure about the bad reviews I have yet to have  a single problem)
As for content, general backup stuff. Backups of my web hosting, [Steam Games Backups]( and most recently I've been collecting old podcasts, such as [Hak5]( and [Diggnation](
For example, Seasons 1-5 of Hak5 fit on a SL BD-R.
I think I will use one of the LTH BD-Rs to back up the Bitcoin blockchain (I use the Satoshi client). I'm kinda weary to use it for important data, but having a backup of the blockchain would be convenient. Also, I haven't tried dual-layer BD-Rs yet.

Gotta stay positive. I noticed after I ordered I accidentally purchased LTH BD-R. Since I use them for archival purposes, I need HTL. But I'm still happy with how easy it was.

Way I see it, both methods steal from the visitor.
Ads steal from those with a bandwidth cap. Tidbit steals from EVERYONE in the form of CPU cycles and utility costs.
So, in terms of the world today (profit at others' expense), it is quite innovative.
I have to side with NJ here. They are going after them for the computer fraud act, because running this is an unauthorized access of my resources. 
Alone, this site is not much harm, however if they win, and others copy this... Imagine every website you visiting having a tidbit type script.. Next thing you know, each tab you have open now is trying to use 100% cpu, at the cost of your electricity and the life of your hardware... for their own profit, and absolutely no gain for yourself.
Oh, and say goodbye to any laptop/netbook battery life if this kind of script becomes mainstream.

No, hardly. Popup blockers are just better. So basically you say we'd have to wait for modern browsers to block the functionality.

You make a fine point. I'll point it out here too but my comments aren't against publishers and sites making money, its how advertisers choose to present their data.
Advertising should be more efficient. It would even save the advertisers money to use 20k-200k JPG vs 20m-200m video files.

Shipping was not free, but was a flat rate by rate I believe. It cost me $4.99. I'm not sure exactly how much bitcoin, since their account system [rounds up to 0.01]( and I know it was not that much.
The total transaction was 0.0123, but there was also a fee (of 0.001) from the BTC network to send it. I'm still new to bitcoin, but I think this is because my balance is split across many addresses, so to send the required amount creates a large transaction size, hence the fee.
As for pricing, BD-R pricing is still all over the place in my opinion. Newegg has the best deal for single layer BD-Rs, but compared to Amazon and Overstock (which I did check first), they are about the same. Keep in mind I was specifically looking for blank BD-R media so did not pay much attention to other prices. Sorry.

I kinda feel bad for    ect. IIRC the original thread offered up to the first 5 people who smashed their phones. So if you were  or higher, you got fucked pretty bad.
If a company tried to do this, they would get sued into oblivion.

Times were a lot different when "advertising" was putting a 5k animated gif on a page. We weren't even metered then, just on dialup.
Now we are in the age of streaming video. You could tell me about your new tomato flavored chips in a simple 20k image, but you'd rather stream a 200mb video file of glorious HD potato goodness.
It is stealing of the user's resources. You are costing the user more (200mb video, say 2gb cap, so 10% of their monthly internet) than it cost you (did it take you 10% of a month to write that article)?
Way I see it, 1 of 3 things can happen
1) The user gets screwed over, because high bandwidth advertising is eating caps. The user doesn't figure it out. (This is what the advertisers and ISPs want)
2) The site gets screwed over, because high bandwidth advertising is eating caps. Customers realize that each visit is NOT free, and is actually costing the visitor money (% of monthly cap). Users stop using the service, the service folds.
3) We get rid of metered once and for all. It is data not a finite resource. (ISPs do NOT want this, advertisers wouldn't mind though, as its more hits)
*Yes, 200mb is an exaggeration, but it makes the point clearer. Also note that when I say "they are stealing", it is towards advertisers and not the publishers and content creators.*

I'm by no means savvy to bitcoin but from what I understand the option is for the new client version, and it is up to these sites you are mentioning to upgrade to it, and not charge a fee.
The fee is probably the sites themselves taking a commission, manually set the fee so the transaction takes place in a timely manner, or are still running the old bitcoind, which defaults to charging transaction fees.
I could be, and am probably totally wrong, so wait for someone to correct me :)

I seen this, and am excited, as it is a great start.

Of course, that is part of the fun of watching a new currency be born.
