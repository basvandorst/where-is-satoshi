what is ironic,  most people dont understand money mechanics of fiat and what gives it value - when they boldly ask me what gives bitcoin its value... 
People accept change they believe in [silly obama].. Maybe if we started convincing everyone bitcoin is the global currency talked about in revelations, people would start 'believing'.. but im just talking a bunch of nonsense

That is pure intimidation tactic bullshit. You can get away with a pound of meth in the trunk of your car, if they cant legitimize the traffic stop. Its all about lawyers and loopholes. Dont admit fault, ever. In fact, don't ever talk to the cops - even if you are trying to help them and be a good guy when they come to you for information about a different case involving other parties. They WILL use any information you give them AGAINST you. It is their job. - that is their perspective

In the United States, the crimes are categorized as misdemeanor or felony.
Most victimless crimes fall under misddemeanor, where as murder, money -laundering, and controlled substances [mdma, over 4 pounds of cannabis, LSD, heroin, etc...] are felonies. A felony is a stigma that sticks to your name for the rest of your life - even after you served your punishment. Once a felon, you lose the right to vote, own guns, and it becomes damn near impossible to get a job. It is a vicious cycle that perpetuates the crime here in America, we also have corporations who own lots of prison infrastructure and they seek to maximize profits by maximizing capacity [~$35k/per year per inmate via taxpayers] through lobbying for victemless crimes [such as the war on drugs]

I suppose there are two types of Big T, the plantation owners who grow the tobacco, and the manufacturers who mark up $.20 packs to $5 retail. I think the latter would profit from nicotine extraction, whereas the cigarette manufacturers have to transition/ adopt to a different industry.

i use coinpayments.net and cryptsy.com and coinbase - when  i receive a payment via coinpayments processor, it auto transfers the balance to cryptsy and set to auto convert to BTC at highest current sell price. Sometimes i will day trade with it, try to earn 5% and then transfer out to coinbase. from coinbase i can deposit USD into the bank.
I would say with the volatility that the lows and highs maybe cancel eachother out, and if you do hit a low - you can do trades to bring it up.

to be honest, i am fairly inexperienced - it was alot for me to process, and their support system was a big turnoff - it may just me and my impatience to read in circles.. but it seemed easier for me to use bluehost with their one click install of wordpress. i like how its fairly cheap 6$ a month isnt too bad considering all the features they have and a simplified display. also i believe they allow you to have as many domains as you want that are independent from eachother, but im not 100% on that. And if youuuu were to write a blog on how to create a start to finish functional woocommerce site and referred a link to the bluehost affiliate - thats 65$ per signup.. thats how they got me, baha
