Too bad BTC transaction fees are often times greater than $3

Is it really duplicable? I'd of thought it was duplicatable.

Vericoin is a better payment/value transfer alternative to LTC. 
It's proof of stake, who doesn't like earning coins daily just for leaving them in an open wallet? And the network has all the security of a proof of work coin because it shares a blockchain with Verium a POW coin. 
Vericoin and Verium Reserve for the WIN!

What's with all the down votes? Too many people are just sheep to their coins. Someone called litecoin dead and another person asked what was potentially better. I chimed in with my answer and a very brief elevator pitch for the project.
The tribalism in crypto sucks.

Why not check online for free? This is a pretty bad argument.

I gotta get me a Russell Okung Jersey! Thanks for spreading the good word Russ :)
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:50:44
Yup, exactly this. I came for the financial incentives and have stayed for the self sovereignty. I have zero intentions of leaving this space regardless of token price.
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:46:37
It's not quite the same. I suppose you could argue I wouldn't want my asic investment to be for naught, but a successful attack and dump of the stolen coins could be worth it. Plus, there are other Sha 256 algo coins.
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:50:41
You're probably right, but we can always dream. Bitcoin already uses more power than many nations and it's only going to get worse. I have a feeling this industry is moving towards POS, it's something BTC should at least consider.
@_date: 2019-04-14 13:51:49
Lol, because it's proof of work... It's a constant horse race for the greatest hash power. Proof of stake is an artificial hash power race, where the more coins you stake, the greater your theoretical hash power. In other words, proof of stake will never have that big of a power draw.
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:24:32
Keep telling yourself that buddy. It's a fool's move to think that Bitcoin is perfect and can't learn from other projects, or perhaps even lose out. Don't forget that as it stands, Bitcoin is slow, expensive, not all that decentralized and such a huge glut of electricity. It was first though, I'll give you that.
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:07:45
I know, I'd rather not dream too because it's a reality ��
@_date: 2019-04-13 02:38:00
Maybe. But the thing is, a 51% attack for a proof of stake network would require you to have 51% of the supply. You tell me, why would a rational actor Sabotage a project when they have such a large investment? POS is actually quite safe because it would make no sense for anyone to do that. Pow on the other hand, just requires 51% of the network strength. I could theoretically create an asic that is exponentially More powerful than any other on the market and destroy Bitcoin without owning any due to my 51% of the hash power.
@_date: 2019-04-12 22:29:08
Yup, that's why I dig VeriCoin for it's proof of stake. Has Bitcoin ever considered making the switch to POS?
@_date: 2019-04-12 23:40:52
Well, VeriCoin has been up and running for 5 years and has never suffered a 51% attack. I'm sure there are other POS coins with long track records of security too.
@_date: 2019-04-24 20:31:24
Highest Market Cap? Absolutely. Superior to all the Shitcoins out there? Nope, not even close. Bitcoin was the first and is thus king, it deserves its place. But superior? I'd argue no. There are a lot of really innovative coins out there, let's be a little more open minded, this space will not succeed without other coins filling in the gaps that Bitcoin alone cannot.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:35:38
But I argue, competition is a good thing. Competition brings forth advancements from everyone competing in the space.  You can't possibly argue against that. As it stands, there are "shitcoins" as you call them, that are faster, have less costly fees, are more decentralized and use very little electricity by comparison.
When was the last time you sent a BTC transaction and thought, "wow, this is as good as it gets!"?
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:21:17
VeriCoin, specifically once the Binary Chain launches. (Interweaving a POS blockchain and a POW blockchain). It's actually a very neat concept if you take the time to read into it.  
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:06:29
Who'd of thunk it!? This is truly groundbreaking journalism, my understanding of cryptocurrency has been turned upside down.

Nah, BTC is great and all but there is plenty of room for another Alt to step in. I for one, really like Vericoin and Verium Reserve. Combining a POW and POS to leverage the strengths of each technology is really neat.
At the end of the day, I don't think BTC is too well equipped to be a quick, cheap value transfer, it works better as a store of value. Vericoin with it's proof of stake is cheaper, quicker and pays holders for staking. And by pairing it with Verium Reserve which is proof of work, it is secure like any other POW coin. Oh and Verium Reserve is CPU mineable and asic resistant, so there's that too. 
I love me some BTC and XMR, they deserve their respective positions. But the currency race is far from over in my opinion. And what Vericoin/Verium Reserve offer is superior. It is secure, it has cheaper transactions, it has quicker transactions, it's ASIC resistant and therefore less prone to centralization and Vericoin holders earn interest by simply staking.
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:11:51
Can you not read? Where did I say Vericoin would supplant Bitcoin? All I said was that there is room for more than one value transfer currency because Bitcoin to me is best used for storing value, not purchasing every day items. I feel there is room for multiple currencies, and litecoin even though it's mostly a clone of Bitcoin, is proving my point. Sheesh...

Yeah, I can't wait for him to get fucked by this. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:21:26
Yes, Hitbtc is garbage. Exchanges are scary, but you need to use them if you want to buy alts. Stick with Binance and Bittrex and you should be good. Still, never wise to hold anything there. But I wouldn't be afraid to send 5 BTC to either exchange, they've proven time and time again to be reliable. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:22:48

He probably does. But you can't trade the BTC for any alt with a hardware wallet....

His parents were fucked by an economic crisis in Greece. I think if you had the same experiences with a human controlled monopoly on money as he did you may look at current systems in a very negative light as well. I agree he can be a bit extreme and one sided, but that's one of the things I like about him. He's an evangelist and obviously has a strong favor for Bitcoin.

I stopped using binance when they shafted Elastos for the community vote listing. Glad I did, don't miss a thing trading on huobi, bittrex and kucoin.
