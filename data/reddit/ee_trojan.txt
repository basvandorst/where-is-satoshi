I misread your initial comment. I still learned a good bit from this so thanks!  It is interesting to see how these issues are so global, I did not know much about the Australia issues going on, and that is a good point about how inflation has been measured.

Can you go into more detail for me or provide sources?  Historically low interest rates meant higher inflation, I know the US is sort of redefining that right now though.  
The fed has a stated inflation target of 2%, is the interest rate not one of the primary ways they control that?

The three basic types:
Market buy: I want to buy now for the lowest available price.  You will be buying from the people who have posted limit sells, meaning you will be removing liquidity. 
Limit Buy: you are not immediately buying, you are saying that you would be willing to buy X amount if the price reaches Y.  For a buy, this will be lower than the current market price and for a sell this would be higher than the current market price.  In a lot of places limit orders have no fee since they add liquidity.
Stop: this is a way to trigger a buy or sell if the price reaches a certain level.  For example, you could place a "stop sell" at $18000 so as soon as that price hits you would initiate a market sell. The down side of this is that temporary dips or manipulation can trigger this sell, and you'd be selling at the bottom.  
Playing around on GDAX, looking at the recent transactions, and browsing the depth chart should make limits pretty obvious! The sell and buy walls on the depth chart are all "limits"

I agree it is like that.  But if one tenth of Nike employees joined "Niked Shoes" and claimed to be the real Nike then the other 90% would have a right to be pissed.  Bitcoin supporters are the large majority still over Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:51:40
It does slightly... the Bitcoin brand is worth a lot in terms of trust and recognition.  It is like saying Nike shouldn't care about a company that starts calling itself "Nike Shoes" because Nike's product is still the same. Someone (Ver and Bcash) is trying to steal the trust and name recognition that Bitcoin has built up.  
Bcash won't be able to scale on-chain if adoption goes up so I think long term it won't be an issue, but there is some reason to be upset.

Don't try to time it too much.  If anything time average it so split up your buy over a few days or weeks.

Whateve mining group finds the block gets all the block reward and fees.  This is done through computation so it is semi random who will "find" the next block first.  Eventually the block reward will be zero but the fees will remain as incentive to mine.

I do not think bitcoin will die either way.  But I do see it as capturing a greater % of the market with some short term scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:20:22
I wish we could just increase the blocksize.  Off chain scaling is obviously necessary, but this short term game is painful.  A slightly larger block size would not have huge long term effects.

Ya Bitcoin adoption is pretty insane right now and outpacing development.  No one is happy with the current state of fees, but in trying to fix it the Devs are looking for the best 10+ year solution.   
I think that it is important to realize that there is not a crypto currency today that can handle actual worldwide adoption.  BCH can currently handle about 30 transactions per second, which is plenty for it's current usage because it is not as widely used as Bitcoin.  
But if they want to rival Visa or actual cash, 30 transactions per second will not do it.  Visa for reference handles from 2000 to 4000 transactions a second.  500MB Blocks every ten minutes is obviously not a realistic solution.  
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:36
I never considered this, thanks for the post.  
I don't think there is a good way to verify this, and even if it is happening there is nothing that can necessarily be done about it.  But this is a flaw in our trustless system I guess, and points to why miner decentralization is important. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:45:42
Scaling.  Bitcoin is at a solid price for its current capabilities, higher prices will require some form of scaling.  Hopefully Lightning is soon!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:32:03
This isn't really a solution though, it just means Coinbase will pay the fee for you.  There is still a fee it is just shifting the burden away from the individual. 
Admittedly this could help pressure them into Segwit, so that's a plus.  I don't know how they will continue to subsidize those fees long term though.  It seems like miners could spam micro withdrawals from GDAX and further increase fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:52:44
What power do Nodes have?  What are the main risks with Nodes becoming centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:09:35
I have a preference for Bitcoin, but I will try to summarize the facts and my views.
Bitcoin Cash is a group that did not want Segwit implemented into Bitcoin.  They thought the code was too complicated or that off-chain scaling deviated from the original vision of Bitcoin.  So they forked prior to Segwit implementation, as after this point Segwit would basically be irreversible.  
Another thing to note is that they implemented a block size increase, which gives a higher limit on transactions per second but comes with some downsides like increased memory requirements for nodes.  The main argument for Bitcoin Cash is that you can currently send money cheaper with it than Bitcoin, as it has a larger transaction limit than Bitcoin and much less usage than Bitcoin.  However, like Bitcoin it would run into scaling issues with mass adoption.
Bitcoin Cash uses the same mining technology as Bitcoin, so there is somewhat of a competition to recruit miners to one coin or the other.  This was made even trickier due to the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA) that Bitcoin Cash implemented, which was getting abused by miners to receive lots of mining rewards in a shorter window of time than had been intended by the development team.  The issues with mining profitability and sharing hashing power have died out a lot since the weeks following when the coin launched though.
I personally believe that part of the resistance to Segwit was to maintain the viability of ASIC Boost by certain miners, which is a patented method of improving mining efficiency.  The mining of Bitcoin Cash is more centralized and started out with only a few anonymous miners, who could have performed a 51% attack.  They did not which I am actually glad of, but it still spooks me.  This is a bit of a controversial point, but I personally believe that ASIC Boost will lead to miner centralization, which has a host of issues associated with it.
The reason I support Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash is that I prefer the Dev team of Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core), I think it has a smarter long term roadmap for scaling, I do not like ASIC Boost, and I think other alts such as Litecoin provide cheap and fast transactions than Bitcoin Cash so it is unnecessary.  
The reason the two communities are combative is a separate thing.  Honestly though, these things should hopefully be secondary to "what is the better crypto technology," and I think they are in the market.  That being said on a social media site like Reddit these issues get a lot of attention so I will address them.
The issue that most people have with Bitcoin Cash is that they are trying to replace "bitcoin" instead of just being their own separate alt coin. I think that they have shills on the internet, they pay for exposure, they attempt to market manipulate, etc.  A pet peeve is that they use the BTC ticker for their subreddit, and they slander this one. If they had just branded as Bcash and done their own thing it would not have been an issue, but most Bitcoin Cash supporter are pretty clear that they would like to become "the real Bitcoin" and completely replace what we currently have.
If you are trying to choose I would ignore the politics aspect, where everyone is extremely biased, and focus on the technology which is easier to do a fair analysis on.  Reddit is a bit of a bubble and the politics are overplayed here because they can be interesting and divisive.
TLDR of my views: Bitcoin Cash is a coin with some pros (cheaper transactions for the time being) and cons (worse long term scaling, Nodes require more memory, worse dev team.)  The reason that things have gotten so heated in the community is that Bitcoin Cash is seeking to replace Bitcoin as "the real Bitcoin," instead of just accepting its role as an alt coin.  
Hope this helps, if you have questions feel free to ask but I probably wont answer until the weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:23:57
Bitcoin Cash still doesn't have as many transactions as Bitcoin.  Bitcoin can handle around 4 transactions per second, where as Bitcoin Cash can handle around 35.  Ethereum is around 15.  Visa's average is around 2000 tx/sec for reference.  None of these coins are good at scaling and that is why so many people are hopeful about Lightning.

This sizing is true of nodes that will keep the entire blockchain. But pruning can reduce the storage requirements drastically and is good enough for most user run nodes. Also, storage technology continues to improve. If you designate say 20GB to your pruned node now, you will simply keep less blocks on your pruned node if Bitcoin changed to 8MB blocks.
No doubt, the full size of the blockchain will grow greatly but I think it is at least worth a discussion whether this trade off is worth it.

I tend to agree...  the limit orders being placed right now are not in line with prices on other exchanges.  Let these manipulators pay to keep the price appearing that high.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:44
GDAX announced they would let people place limit orders but not start trading.
The limit orders that came in on BCH/BTC said that someone was willing to buy 1 BCH for 3 BTC...  Which would be a 50k per BCH price.  This is not just stupid it is malicious, since it appears that you can buy at this price but trading is not live.  
It is meant to get people to buy BCH on other exchanges, but the GDAX prices are currently stupid because people like me can't even log in to buy this cheap Bitcoin.
I tried to log in 100 times to buy Bitcoin at 16200.

No, it is not.  Bitcoin Cash does not want Segwit, they do not want lightning, they only want to scale by increasing block size which is stupid.  That being said, there are many of us who think that a block size is a good partial solution and that Lightning will fix the rest.
Even with Lightning there will be a need for on chain transactions.

BCH/BTC trading needs to open on GDAX NOW!!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:09:38
I see that being the case in 2 years.  But two years is a long time. Bitcoin WILL be replaced in some of its current uses in the meantime.  I gamble online and deposit with Bitcoin, those sites now all accept other cryptos as well because of the fees.  I actually trust the core team to get lightning right, and investment wise I rely on BTC, but I would feel a little bit better if it retained those markets.
I think an extra ~800GB (assuming no pruning and all blocks are full, so worst case) on top of the blockchain is not a bad price to pay for far better performance during those two years.
The extra functionality for current users, getting new users accustomed to actually using Bitcoin as a currency, and the current/new use cases that will be discovered all make this worth it.  A 1TB hard drive is 50 bucks on amazon right now and a two terabyte is $66.
I get it is a debate but I am surprised it is not even thought of as an option.  I expect fees to just keep climbing without some block size increase.  I also think that 2 or 4 MB should be discussed. Another option to prevent transaction spamming that will artificial grow theingblockchain could be something like increasing blocksize but have a minimum fee, scale blocksize or scale blocksize based on Mempool.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:33
It's because it has the most adoption. 
 No crypto can handle mass adoption right now.  Bitcoin investors think that Bitcoin has the best scaling road map long term.

They had announced that they would be giving users access to their BCH by 2018.  They released not only the coins but started trading on their exchange yesterday with no notice, until the exchange couldn't handle it and everything crashed.
I personally was annoyed because they allowed limit sell orders to show up for hours that were well above market value, giving incentive for people to buy on other exchanges thinking they could arbitrage.  I also expect a lot of this to sort itself out once trading actually begins and people are allowed to sell on GDAX.  I am expecting a ton of Bitcoin users to dump their BCH as soon as trading starts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:12:52
Haha that's the whole point.  "Hey if I buy BCH elsewhere I can sell it for 50k at GDAX."  Don't fall for it people! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:31:26
I would say it is worth it to sell Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin.  If you use an exchange like GDAX there will be a .25% fee to do so.  
Taxes are tricky.  You probably have to report any new Bitcoin you get as having a zero cost basis, but the IRS has no rules in place for Bitcoin forks.  I would certainly recommend paying something when you swap it to cash though, I plan to just treat it as having an initial cost of zero.

Steam stopped accepting.  
Bovada.lv, largest US online sports betting site, started accepting Bitcoin Cash "due to fees." They used to only take Bitcoin (and promoted it heavily.)
Ignition.lv, one of the largest 2 online poker sites, also started accepting bitcoin cash due to fees. 
Overstock accepts litecoin and other cryptos.
When given options people will at least explore the other currencies.  And in the short term they may be better.  I would like Bitcoin to keep being the best option for both long term investors (I think it is now with no change) and near term users (it is not always.)

Ethereum DApp called cryptokitties is messing up that network and exposing some of the limitations.  They hit their transaction limit and now fees and wait times are going up, just like what happened with Bitcoin.  If a single cat breeding program can cause massive issues on your network, you may be in trouble.  
Litecoin is currently a faster and cheaper bitcoin but has struggled to receive adoption. With Lightning Network those advantages will be gone and it will not really have a benefit versus Bitcoin.

Yes. The core devs have mentioned it as a possibility in the past.  I think the original reason that Bitcoin Cash forked was because of disagreement with Segwit more so than for the block increase.  
I am a big fan of Segwit and Lightning, which Cash seems to dislike, but I am not a big fan of the short term fees.  I am excited about the future but I actually used Bitcoin as a payment method so the last six months has kind of been painful to me.

Yeah but depends on where you had the coins.
If you have seed words, I used electrum.  Input the keys to the wallet, then send the coins to an exchange (I used Bittrex) then swap them for bitcoin.  There should be more detailed tutorials online if you need them. 
If you don't have private keys (for example Coinbase does not provide) you will have to see how they released the bitcoin cash or when they plan to do it.  Coinbase will be in the next few weeks.

Hey, a bit of a self plug because I own this website, but check it out I just published something today!  No ads or paywalls or anything I just do it for fun.
Edit: also in terms of the when, probably not for about a year.  Lightning needs to be released and then actually adopted.  Hopefully continued Segwit adoptions will keep fees at least stable or lower them slightly before then though!  Especially if big players like Coinbase and Core get on board.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:23
UP.  At least at first, there is a line of people waiting to swap BCH to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:01:15
That is the question that we are faced with. I prefer litecoin to Bcash because it's average confirmation time is actually much lower for the same number of transactions (faster block times.)  So if litecoin is already successfully filing the gap of a coin that can do around 50 tx/sec, I think it is fair for Bitcoin to aim bigger as the coin that will do thousands of transactions per second with low fees. 
I think most Bitcoin supporters are looking beyond 6 months.  If bitcoin can do thousands of transactions per second in a few years, why will we need a coin that can do 40 or 50?  If Lightning Network does work be prepared for Litecoin and Bcash both to be worth near zero (which is a bit scary for me because I have lots of Litecoin!)

You can't time the market.  The price right now reflects speculation about it going up and down.  
If you do want to invest, I think as soon as possible is best.  If you are worried about buying a peak, the best way to safe guard that is to spread out your buys over a week or two, or even longer if you like.  
Bitcoin has a ton of upside, so it is a high expected value play.  That being said, it is a higher risk investment than many others so don't put more money in than you can afford to lose if the price dips.

Choose any major exchange, GDAX.com is my favorite as long as you don't mind the IRS having some idea about your buy.
GDAX is an exchange owned by Coinbase, so it is very reputable and sign up is pretty easy. I helped my family buy similar amounts and it is not a lot of effort at all.
If you've never used an exchange, I recommend splitting up your buy into four or five equal sized market buys spread out over a few minutes. 
Bitcoin is not that complicated as a user.  There is a lot to know if you want to study it, but as a basic investment don't worry about it.

I wanted to add that one of the main reasons bitcoin and Venezuela are discussed together so often is not necessarily a use case but as a warning about fiat. The government there implemented policies that led to their currency being basically worthless. One of the major arguments for Bitcoin is that government controlled currency is at risk of this, and Venezuela just happens to be one of the more recent examples.

Holding both means holding less BTC.  I will take my BTC over supporting a centralized chain that won't become decentralized as long as they support covert ASIC Boost.
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:21:54
ASIC Boost is a patented technology
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:18:11
I am curious as well... I am wondering if this was the point of Bcash in the first place, knowing these minors might look for somewhere else to guy.
If someone can explain the downsides of ASICBoost and why Core is getting rid of it I would appreciate it

You can't time the market.  The price right now reflects speculation about it going up and down.  
If you do want to invest, I think as soon as possible is best.  If you are worried about buying a peak, the best way to safe guard that is to spread out your buys over a week or two, or even longer if you like.  
Bitcoin has a ton of upside, so it is a high expected value play.  That being said, it is a higher risk investment than many others so don't put more money in than you can afford to lose if the price dips.

I feel like people forget that Bitmain is a company, with hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profits potentially coming from ASIC Boost, where as Core is an independent group of developers.  
Bitmain has money in the game, thats why they are pushing BCH so hard.

Or increase your BTC holdings before BCC dies. Holding both has a major opportunity cost. BCC is going to be dominated by the covert ASIC Boost miners

Not what you asking but... I just sold a friends Bcash doing this.  Blockchain.info to electrum.
I used the 12 word seed from blockchain.info, added a new wallet to electrum, said I already had a seed, selected Bip39 under options, typed them in, and was done.  
The first time I did it, the balance was zero because I had used capitalization in the seed words.  
I think with seed words you can do this in about 5 minutes.

Here is the thing about patents: if they are ever granted, anyone who infringed on the patent during the application period can still be retroactively sued as if it were normal patent infringement.  (This is at least true in the US, I am not expert on China.  I believe patent law is fairly international though.)  
I don't read chinese but it was my understanding that the linked patent was approved.  Even if that is not the case though, it is a null point because people can not just start making ASIC Boost chips until the patent is approved.  Once approved, they will be heavily sued for infringement, so being the first application on record basically gives 20 years of exclusive rights.  
Otherwise public patent applications would be ridiculous and not a thing, as it would just be giving away your ideas to competitors.

Bitcoin has gone on steadily, maintaining most of the price increase it saw in the last month with some dips. 
Bitcoin Cash has gone up in price, which has some worried.  Others say that it is an alt coin made to continue ASIC Boost mining and to get the patent holders rich.
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:47:33
Sure... BCH will adjust to become more difficult.   If ALL hashing power from bitcoin moved to BCH, then bitcoin would become more profitable to mine again after BCH adjusted the difficulty to one block per 10 minutes.  Obviously this would be bad, but pretty quickly the BTC chain would be more profitable to mine again.  
Realistically a lot of miners will jump back and forth to the most profitable chain.  This has helped BCH so far, as a lot of people thought it would never get this far.  But going forward it will not really benefit either chain all that much. 
BCH does have the small advantage of an emergency difficulty adjustment.  But it is unlikely at this point that either chain will die due to lack of miner support unless one coin becomes close to worthless.  Just my opinions. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:52:06
It is approved in China.  You may be thinking of the patent filed in the US that is pending? If approved it would overrule Bitmain's patent due to an earlier submission date, but many speculate that Bitmain purchased this patent through a separate LLC and either way it would lead to even more centralization. Bitmain is the only company allowed to use this in China currently, which is the main hub for mining due to low electricity costs.  No one else can compete.

I got this from the Bitmain website.  "Bitmain holds the ASICBOOST patent in China." So pardon my confusing on pending versus approved.  
The statement is a good read.  Bitmain considers the patents currently valid, and would like to work with a licensing system to other manufacturers.  
Semantics aside this is an issue that should be planned for.  I do not think it is FUD.  Even if patents are currently not issued, and patent pending lawsuits are not strong enough to win damages, that does not change the fact that when one of these patents is awarded a company can create a monopoly on profitable mining hardware.  Hopefully they will be kind enough not to use it or to make the patent public, but bitcoin should not be based on the goodwill of a small group.

If I had to guess, I would say you might be not have the correct 12 word seed. You can get it from bc.i from Settings-&gt;Security.
This is a different approach you could try? 
Finally, you could just wait.  Blockchain.info is going to add BCH support.

I think Bitcoin Cash has been in the news enough that it should be addressed, as it is a slight threat to interrupt bitcoin's adoption.  I think that it is deceptive though and is intended to profit certain people more so than to be the best thing for bitcoin.  I am a big believer in core.

This may be part of it, but I also think the extreme currency control and the fluctuation in oil prices definitely played a role. There is a planet money episode on it that I enjoyed, if you are interested I can try to find it for you.

There isn't almost any mining in the US, electricity is too expensive.  Net neutrality still matters a lot for bitcoin, but not necessarily for this reason.

You can buy/send one millionth of a coin.  Almost all transactions are made up by fractional amounts of coins.

Coinbase.com if you want the easy route... Gdax if you are buying a lot. GDAX is a little trickier to use as it is the actual exchange owned by coinbase.com but the fees are much lower.

I understand your sentiment.  I personally would not kneel.  That being said people need an outlet to protest peacefully and loudly, and I do think the things they are protesting are legitimate.  There are racial biases and injustices in our system. 
Yes, they are on the job but their bosses are allowing it, they are not hurting or even inconveniencing anyone, and game day is their main opportunity to reach a wide audience.  The reality is that athletes are nothing more than entertainers, they do not have critical jobs and them protesting while at work really doesn't affect as much as most other professions.
Like any protest group, there are people who are slightly ignorant (kaepernick).  I am into environmental issues but I can't stand the crowds at environmental protests, there are usually a ton of ignorant people.  But that doesn't erase the issues or mean the cause is unjust.
I guess my end point is that these guys are trying to do something good with their platform and spread awareness about something that is important in our country right now.  Even if their method was imperfect I do not think that is cause for outrage, I think that is nitpicking.  Kneeling during the anthem is not the worst way to point out, "Hey there is a big problem in our country." It does not need to mean you don't respect the military or appreciate the good parts of the country.

The term hodl, which is now ubiquitous on Bitcoin forums, came from a classic post by a drunk guy about not trying to beat the pros.  The best way for people who aren't spending lots of time studying Bitcoin to invest in it is to buy and hold. The current price is a decent representation of what the overall market thinks the value is right now. 
My advice is always the same: Don't worry about trying to time the market.  Don't think about short term gains to much.  Just buy and hodl.

Any clue if they allow you to file for like-kind? I traded some ethereum to bitcoin in 2017, I know the IRS hasn't made this clear but I would be willing to take that risk and file for like-kind if there was a software that could do that for me.

I don't see why Bitcoin supports this guy so much.  Sure he helped accelerate adoption, but if you truly believe in the technology and concept of Bitcoin I think we would be at about the same place today without him.  
At this point, there is pretty strong evidence he tried to hire a hit man and kill someone.  Whether you like his sentencing or not that is enough to make me dislike him as a person.

No one is complaining about the flag or our troops.  It started as a form of protest against racial injustices in the legal system.  
His rant is also against the people who kneeled after saying they wouldn't? He actually makes some great points about how the original reason for the protests got lost in the noise.
