who did you kill to get the money? :D
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:20:33
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:29:32
Why would it ever drop that low?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:05:49
can more people confirm this?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:39:45
No? Explain
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:18:06
I'm just thinking about selling right now and buy back in after new years.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:52:48
why? you have a source?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:50:51
A currency everyone can access
@_date: 2018-10-31 11:10:38
Sooo, happy birthday bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-04 07:10:58
Greenland belongs to Denmark, so It's legal (Y)
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:35:01
We can get previous transactions and that's it
@_date: 2018-11-08 10:25:19
Up you go!

@_date: 2019-05-29 10:29:32
I hold neither, I'm just curious why everyone here seems to prefer btc when it has so high fees
@_date: 2019-05-28 11:10:44
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:42:43
Seriously only looking for info about why bitcoin is favourable despite the fees and times.
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:20:39
Transaction fees are expensive
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:20:47
Seriously? Discuss instead. Massive twat.
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:03:11
Because I don't trust big coorporations
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:15:06
Bitcoin is very expensive and very slow
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:56:24
So far none of you have given me a single reason
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:34:20
Condescending. Great way of discussion.
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:05:02
Valued comment. Try to educate me instead of being condescending. Of course it isn't the same, but how if it different in a bad way?
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:26:24
They actually care about low fees and fast transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:14:31
Because its not a real blockchain
@_date: 2018-12-05 08:41:51
I do, I have my paper wallet typed down by hand. Call me paranoid, but that's me!
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:32:47
Why the hell won't a fast transaction be necessary in the future?
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:21:53
Bitcoin cash seems to do the same thing faster and cheaper, for instance.
