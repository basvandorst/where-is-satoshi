If you think money will make you happy,  I'm afraid your in for a shock. Economic freedom and equality are just some of the ideologies that have a greater chance of bringing peace/happiness in your life.  But you may get them as a result of bitcoin anyway. Good luck either way!

Hopefully the volume starts to increase there now as a show of support. No need for regulation when the community self regulates... 
@_date: 2014-01-05 11:54:44
Actually you are right there, my bad. 
I will say tho there are one million traded like you said but there is only something like 50k-60k coins on offer at the moment on exchanges (rough guess on my phone). Depends how quick that cash came in for what the price would do no? 
@_date: 2014-02-12 04:21:52
I actually like this idea on some levels. However, I feel that its not the bitcoin foundations responsibilty, but rather a new group should be formed that tackles these issues head on and is well funded from the community. 
Something with Andreas Antonopoulos (I do realise he can't be involved in everything aspect due to time constraints) or similar inspirational leader as head of that group. 
It is something that should be discussed, and if general consensus is achieved should be implemented. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:37:18
I'm not down voting you, I just think your missing the point. As the currency grows you keep dividing it. Its the whole point of bitcoin really. Nobody loses when this happens.

"By the way, as a company, we don’t have a bank account, and we have no intention of ever opening a bank account."
Fascinating article and that comment was actually really interesting. Seems like we have a revolution in the way businesses can actually conduct themselves online. I never really thought about businesses that can't or don't want to open bank accounts can now have access to a global economy and non traditional banking services, amazing times!
@_date: 2014-01-05 11:35:06
That's not correct. 350 billion dollars "looking" for bitcoin sellers would need all up at current prices of say $1000, 350 million bitcoins to fill that order. That many don't exist obviously and there is only a small % of the actual total number of bitcoins for sale on the exchanges. 
Also as the price went up you can't get as many coins, so 2.8 million per coin *could* be correct for sure. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:56:08
I will donate for this cause. Let's get it done. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:24:17
But at this stage they are only as relevant as we give them credit. They aren't a functional exchange at the moment and the price there currently confirms this.

Interview with Leah from Newsweek in 3 2 1
@_date: 2014-01-05 10:55:15
1% of 35 trillion dollars (estimate for cash in overseas bank accounts in 2014) is 350 billion dollars. 
If that kind of money came into the exchanges now there obviously wouldn't be anywhere near enough coins to fill demand. So I'm not sure how a final figure would be obtained, but its safe to say it would be north of a million. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:32:55
How would the price be set? Who provides the pool of liquidity? If I'm a seller on second market obviously I can't set my price, why would I use them? 
These are serious questions btw, curious.

DDOS to coincide with FUD above
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:08:41
Hmmm. I think that's not true. Bitcoin is revolutionary technology. On the same par as the internet some would say. Now obviously the internet needed special hardware to access it. So the same could easily be true for mainstream bitcoin security. Two years from now if bitcoin is the success we all envisage, then surely there will be Trezor like devices in every place that sells USB memory sticks presently. 
At least that's my thinking.

Touchy subject. But I believe the degree to which spanking a child has an effect on that child is huge. I'm not going to go into all here and I'm not saying its the whole answer either. But if there is one thing as a society we could change and having a great change as a result spanking is as good as any. 
BTW I do work in this area so not just saying things for the sake of them. Have had first hand experience on many levels.

So creating a block at the same time means they both completed the proof of work at exactly the same time (to the second) or roughly the same time (and it depends more on how far across the network it has been sent)?

"But Cohen also said the U.S. would choose “transparency,” or regulation, over innovation when it came to upholding the law. " 
My stomach turns a little bit when I hear these kind of comments. When did the world become so afraid? And of what?  
@_date: 2014-02-05 06:33:53
Eh no they don't. If you move the decimal place further than 8 decimal spots you aren't generating more tokens. Your just dividing what is out there into even smaller and smaller units. If you own 1 whole bitcoin it isn't being devauled by this; only allowing it to be split into more pieces then before.

That just isn't feasible. No way I'll be keeping track of my daily purchases and comparing them to bitcoin prices I bought at to calculate CGT, regardless of what the aus government decide. 
I'm not disagreeing with you, it's highly likely, but it's not something I personally would follow to the letter.

@_date: 2014-01-09 22:15:21
Which at this stage of the game makes sense. Seriously bitcoin would have to be infinitely more stable to expect them to give your bitcoins back. Imagine how many cancelled orders they would have every time bitcoin rose a significant amount (a daily occurrence nowadays at some point during that day).  
@_date: 2014-07-27 04:12:55
Visa has more incentive then ever to work with apple now that bitcoin is ever so slightly on their radar. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 11:48:26
Pretty good video actually. Sums up where bitcoin is at currently for those not in the bitcoin space and mentions the pro's and con's mostly fairly. 
Saving $50,000 for that business is a massive positive point regardless of where anyone stands in regard to bitcoin and can't be ignored! 
@_date: 2014-02-04 07:52:36
I bought a nexus 5 online yesterday, when that comes ill be selling my iphone 5. 
Pretty much because of their bitcoin stance, but also the closed system is getting me down, and ive never ever liked itunes or the fact that I can just drag and drop songs onto my phone... wtf!

Getting them off bitcoinwisdom would be a great start!!
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:42:38
Just watch the fiat side. Cashing out of exchanges into fiat will be one such area. Use localbitcoins instead and use cash transactions in person.  
Also every purchase you make with bitcoin and have a product sent out to your address could be tracked as well (but wouldn't unless you were audited). Think about declaring those bitcoins or risking it...
EDIT: Also keep wallets separate whenever it is possible. For instance if you buy some bitcoins from localbitcoins don't send them to an address where you have bought some bitcoins from an exchange and that you will be declaring. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:24:29
When traditional gold bugs start educating themselves about bitcoin I think we can safely assume that bitcoin will capture some of this market. It's essentially digital gold, having just about all the same features of real gold. Oh, and I believe it does have what they call "intrinsic value" in the security and flexibility of the network/payment system (the largest distributed computer system on the planet is valuable!). 
So we could assume bitcoin will capture some of that market. But I do like what you've tried to show here, just feel it's missing points, because bitcoin is many things to many people! 
Edit: just read your reply about taking only the most conservative approach - point taken. Any1 keen for an optimistic calculation? :)

So basically investing in seedcoin is essentially having my investment diversified into what havelock investments deems worthy? Sounds good.
Are dividends paid or just an increase in price to be expected for my investment? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 09:14:14
Bought PETA shares at a low. Now they are worth 30% more and I got dividends in the meantime. Did help that they just changed their system.
I was just testing it out I actually didn't expect to make anything. 
Wouldn't recommend it. But it can be done.

A tip i heard for google authenticator is to have the app on your phone and tablet at the same time. So if you lose one you can use the other to still get in to your account. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 17:40:40
Nope its all in bitcoin. Haven't considered the fiat equivalent. I know its hard to believe...

Good thing there is a little piece of evidence called the blockchain that can verify this either way. 
Hint: doesn't end well for Mt Gox

Why doesn't Ghash.io close up new subscriptions for the next three months? Short term solution I know, but effective as the collective hash rate of all other pools grows in those three months (or any other time period).

The part about faster than exponential growth is actually true, if bitcoin does reach that critical point where basically fiat currencies become useless, and the majority of people holding bitcoins don't wish to sell (for fiat).

If I want to pay in bitcoin and the owner wants to accept my bitcoin, why shouldn't I have that option of freely choosing what currency I use?
