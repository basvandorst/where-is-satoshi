Unless bitcoins goes down in value, than you're down 1 coin and 1 coin worth less.

In its 10 year history there are only about 8 months in which you would be in the red if you bought. 
Holders aren’t worried, the noobs are.

You're right how could people googling how to buy bitcoin possibly affect price.

Metal has a real world use, stop comparing the two.

You acknowledge there is a difference but insist on likening them together...

Yes country’s exchange gold. When is Bitcoin going to be used as money?

Meanwhile in r/bitcoin
The bankers will give us their money any day now, they always get in at the top floor of an investment.

The 90% correction cycles will kill Crypto. Going from $1k to $100 is one thing, Going from $20K to $1K produces a lot of losers but not globally noticeable. 
Going from $1M to $100K is apocalyptical. There will be a run on Bitcoin until it's worth 0.

Privacy/fungibility features and Hollywood + UFC sponserships. 
Also over the last year a person / group bought up about 15% of all litecoins and effectively took them out of the market which alleviates selling pressure. 
Edit oh and halving in 6 months or so.

Litecoin.

This argument made sense before Bitcoin forked 10 times. Literally created out of nothing.

Do you think it's easy to sell $1bn in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:10:50
A Blog post advertising someone who wants to buy Bitcoin off exchange so they don't increase the price themselves and miss out on gains.

Yea because you will never see someone on instagram with a million followers shill gold but they will all shill crypto. 
The young generation are morons and will buy what they are told to buy or perceive a good buy because their "idle" also "bought" it.

*Litecoin is top performing.

This all seems way to early I wasn't expecting moves until this time 2021. 
Has there been enough time since the last run for people to have forgotten and subsequently triggered into fomoing again?

He just said gold is useless. Think that invalidates anything he has to say. Incase anyone else is dumb like him, gold is used in industry, pharmacy and aerospace to name a few. I think his point about it being **literally** useless applies to fairy money.

Prices will never be that high. Do people forget bitcoin is meant to be another form of money? Fluctuations happen, the recent because of hype but at the end of the day, if something costs $5k, who's gonna go buy 1 bitcoin to then buy that item for $5k? Prices will even out at $100 long term.
