What are the Venmo security issues you allude to? Used only once, but interested in knowing your thoughts...

Pretty sure the rotation is just off. Rotate 90° to the right and it just a nice, soft, fluffy boob pillow.

Same thing happened to me, my phone broke, couldn't use it, then I got a new one with the same number, no chance to do a clean Authenticator switch. CB Customer service was quick to respond. While in comm with them I was able to access by logging in to the Coinbase mobile app cause it has limited functionality and did not require Authenticator, and I'm not sure if that helped in some way, but eventually it switched to SMS authentication with these actions. Point being you're not completely screwed, I got back in.

English is weird though...e.g. a single item is referred to as a pair (two items) of pants (plural) and a pant isn't a thing elswhere without the other. I'm gunna put on my pair of sleeves and torso cloth, pair of shoes, socks and my two pants now...

You got some replies with the OG link, however, I always thought it to be an acronym for "Holding On [for] Dear Life" - I made that shit up I guess...
