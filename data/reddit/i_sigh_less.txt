Considering they only paid a few million for those bitcoins, they are waaaay ahead.

I bought 0.1 bitcoin when it was at $17,125.  The trick is not to care about it's value in USD, because it's its value in bitcoin that will ultimately be important, and that isn't fluctuating.

Even a good person might be tempted.

This sort of thing is both the weakness and the strength of crypto currency.

It has a few electronic and chemical applications, but those are reletively recent introductions.

Or any currency at all.

So in other words, bitcoin is now a federally recognized currency?

I hope it takes a hit... Then I will buy.

It's not a scam.  Yes, more efficient fission would be great, but fusion is better over the long term.  We know it's possible, and it really is getting closer.

Well, gold does have the one advantage that you can stick it in a sock and beat someone to death with it.

According to some back of the napkin math I just did, consider the following:
Solar panels produce around 200 watts per square meter in direct sunlight.  You get direct sunlight less than half the time, but let's be generous and say we can average 100 Wh per hour over the course of a year.
The South Texas Project nuclear power plant produces 2,500,000,000 watts while both it's reactors are running, which is most of the time.  Each of the two shuts down for a few months every 2 years.  So, as a whole, it averages something like 2,000,000,000 Wh per hour.
So the equivalent area that would need to be deforested to support that number of solar panels is about 20 square kilometers.  Probably more like 30 if we leave room to walk between the panels.
Now, a fusion reactor could theoretically put out much more power than STP in a much smaller plant, potentially saving hundreds vast swathes of land for nature preservation.  Solar panels are likely to get more efficient, but even a perfect panel that converted ALL the solar energy (a thermodynamic impossibility) would only get us to about 300 watt-hours per hour when averaged over a day, and that's if we assume it's never cloudy.  In this theoretical maximum, it would still take 10 square kilometers to replace STP.

You aren't "selling bitcoin".  You're buying dollars.

Yes, the isotopes of Beryllium that are created by neutron bombardment are radioactive for a long time, but they are all still Beryllium.  It doesn't turn into the hundreds of different fission products that can occur when a U-235 atom splits.   That makes it fundamentally easier to deal with.

All I can say for sure is that we aren't mature enough to responsibly use energy that causes climate change.

How is it unrealistic?  They've done it.
How is it not cleaner?  It's only byproduct is a noble gas.

When you buy it, does it just go into your wallet?

If our goal is to transition to clean enegy, it's not overkill to consider what it takes to replace a large power plant.  Obviously, replacing fossil fuel plants would be the actual goal.  I was only mentioning the nuclear plant as I expect it to be more comparable to the fusion plant we were originally talking about.  But the point is that even solar is not without environmental cost in the form of land.  Of course, the real power of solar is that everyone can potentially have panels on their own roof, thus reducing some of the need for centralized generation.  But there will still be a need for it, and fusion is potentially the cleanest way to do it.

I think blockchain tech has high potential, but bitcoin may not end up being a really viable implementation of it.  Only time will tell.  I'm hoping it does, because I have a little bit (that I bought near the peak).  If it ends up not being viable, the price will drop to zero, and people will stop mining it.  If it ends up being viable, the limited number of bitcoins will make each one inflate in value over time.

Nah, that was completely unrelated, I'm sure.  After all, it didn't happen in 'Merica, so it can't really be significant.
