Ha, that's a good one. How's your customer service team with your tv provider? Or phone? Money does not imply quality of service.

Really the point of it that I can see it least is entirely development related. Since its always mining, I can always have a stream of Satoshis to work with testing different accounts, api, etc
For instance, in my store example, since I have multiple accounts (one server for the store one client for a test) I can have the chip slowly generating Satoshis to be able to test buying and selling to myself with, independent of my personal accounts. 
I could obviously use my own money for this as well, but this way I don't have to bother sending money from my wallet every time I want to test something.
It's definitely not meant to compete with an ant miner  or anything like that, only to supplement development processes it seems.

This isn't the only implementation of the 21 computer, nor is it one I am pursuing. I bought this device to experiment with, learn from, and contribute to Bitcoin, not to make money. The store concept was simply just an experiment.
I've only just scratched the surface of this thing as I've only had it one day, but I am excited by the possibilities

But by spreading the number of devices that are mining bitcoins, you strengthen Bitcoin itself and its valuation. So if said company is invested in Bitcoin to this extent, then the value increase of Bitcoin would outweigh the negative energy costs of running the device(s), hence still making them more efficient. 
Of course this is all speculative and utopian

If you are asking questions like this, you're probably best off not mining. 
However if you're still insisting on mining, do a bit of research first. Remember how volatile Bitcoin is, as well as how ever increasing the difficulty is. Very risky endeavor.
