Why is this more valuable than just holding bitcoin with the expectation that the price goes up? Do you expect that the ETF is going to behave differently than the bitcoin price? I think I don't understand enough about finance to understand why this is a useful construct.

I might be a bit happy when a gang banger with a knife comes at me and says 'your bitcoins or your life'. Then, I imagine him awkwardly trying to scan a qr code on my phone while still trying to look threatening and keep his distance.
(And then I report him to the cops and get them to use the blockchain to track him down.)

And I just bought Twitch Turbo (their premium package) for good behavior. I'll be making donations to my favorite streamers in the form of several month subscriptions via bitcoin once they opt in. I hope the payment processor gives the streamers and Twitch the ability to cash out in bitcoin or at least easily know how much of their revenue is via each method.
@_date: 2014-11-30 22:40:00
What's the mechanism for when they get the package and refuse to release funds? Call the cops? What if it's another country? Pay half up front?
Would be cool if you could send a self destructing box that destroyed the goods unless they paid up -- automatically.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:47:42
Well, you don't shut it off -- you just set up a system to lower the effectiveness of each user's hashing. Perhaps that's not feasible currently, but it's theoretically possible. Most users, I expect, wouldn't even notice.
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:45:55
By that logic, the bitcoins I bought a few weeks ago for 290 have gained about 100$ of value each. Wow, what a bargain -- spending those coins, I actually pay a discount of like 25% on anything I buy.
@_date: 2014-10-20 04:58:13
There is a service now from coinkite that is called Nyms. It assigns personal info to addresses. This could easily work as a centralized lookup for address. Heck, one scan of that qr code could send funds and email you a receipt at once.
I get nerd chills thinking about it :-)
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:39:07
Hey, thanks for taking the time to post this here.
Looking down the list though, it really looks like the only things that aren't solved by software are the printer-related stuff.
But I really don't think that's the way the world's moving. For example, I had the pleasure of using one of Square's PoS terminals a couple months ago: 
Which is an iPad. If you scroll down, they even have sweet little printers that work with it. But realistically, even the printer bit is going the way of the dodo. If you've used square with an independent merchant, most of the time, they just e-mail your receipt to you. That's way better than having a paper copy. I'm sure some people are still in the habit of paper receipt collecting, but I see absolutely no reason why it's a good idea.
Plus, although coinkite clearly tried really hard to make a nice list of why their terminal is better than a tablet, you gotta run the mental list through your head of the reverse. An iPad does infinitely more than this terminal can do. For example, you can run Square's software on it and pay fiat. Or you can avoid lock-in into coinkite's system. Or you can run a promo video on it while it's not in use. It's just a much better device.
I see no way that dedicated bitcoin terminal hardware will be around in 5 years. That's just trying to emulate the old way of doing things rather than moving forward.
@_date: 2014-10-14 19:30:53
Yeah, your example is an interesting one, though to play devil's advocate -- this can be done with any 3rd party, timestamped service. I.e. I could have just as easily put that hash on github's gist service, and point to it later -- "look, there's the hash with a timestamp from several days ago -- so clearly the photo happened then".
So I guess that I'm saying that I don't see the value of using the blockchain as a place to store data. You can just keep it on a service somewhere. None of the magic of blockchain technology is really leveraged here -- except that it's "indestructible".
But anyway, thank you, I think I have quite a bit more clarity into this particular facet of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:44:25
Who said anything about explosives? Anyway, yeah, the goal would be to build the box to be largely tamper-proof and legal to send. I was thinking of those legendary codex tube things where it just shreds the contents if you put in the wrong code.

Yep, I agree. Thanks again for taking the time to explain.
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:51:48

Honestly, I kind of suspect Satoshi saw this coming (he saw pretty much everything coming, it seems). I feel like this limit is what it is for the purpose of giving the bitcoin ecosystem a beginner's tutorial on global updates. This change is mandatory, but trivial -- and obvious when it will be required. Still, it means we must band together and coordinate an update.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:15:38
Yep, that's a good question. I don't have a good solution.
@_date: 2014-10-14 20:25:57
I had an equally pleasant experience with Coinbase fyi. They have a chat thing built into their sites, and that was instant and pleasant.
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:24:28
So part of this I have a hard time understanding -- ok, so you can store 40 bytes to the blockchain as part of a transaction. But bitcoins spent this way are removed from UTXO, and rendered unspendable -- an article elsewhere in this comment thread mentions that they can be redeemed as a mining fee.
So am I correct in understanding that this means that you in essence pay the miners to store some data for you?
But how is this useful for transference of digital property? It seems to me that it's kind of bad, since once you send someone some data using the OP_RETURN mechanism, you basically completely lose control of that token -- since it's now unspendable bitcoin that can only be collected as a mining tip?
I think I don't understand something completely.
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:42:37
Really? That sounds very bad. That could be used as an attack vector. Ex. say you're running GHash. Over time, you slowly run your network at lower and lower percentage capacity. I.e. instead of hashing at 100%, you slowly move it down to like 50%.
Reddit community celebrates that your share is dropping.
Then, when the difficulty is nice and low, you slam on your hashing power to 100% and enjoy having potential discoveries way faster for 2 weeks.
I'm sure this was thought of -- though I'm unsure exactly what the difficulty changing mechanics are. Does it happen gradually, or is it like timed that every 2 weeks the network looks itself over and makes a decision? Because if it's that second thing, then you could time your manipulation in such a way that you sandbag your hashrate the night before the difficulty change, then ramp it way the hell up the next day.
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:15:07
I'd love to hear an explanation of how I wasn't :-)
That sounds entertaining

One thing that I still can't figure out is how gift cards are becoming a method of payment above and beyond their designed usecase.
For example, Twitch recently announced that they accept Bitcoin. What weirds me the fuck out, though, is that when I used it, Bitcoin was like the 5th thing in their list -- after Subway Giftcards.
You can pay for Twitch with Subway Giftcards. Wtf? How the fuck are Subway Giftcards a means of exchange?

I've often wondered. What happens when blocks run out, and all bitcoins are found? And the people start to lose them over time to hard drive crashes and stuff. Can the limit be raised gracefully without causing a massive rebalance of value?
@_date: 2014-10-16 21:13:50
I mean, if your argument is that bitcoin is a volatile currency with an uncertain future, this is absolutely true.
But using stocks as a form of savings isn't exactly a new idea, so I'm surprised to find someone that thinks that "investing your money in stock-like entities is a stupid idea".
@_date: 2014-11-06 00:32:26
I don't believe this actually happens. The bitcoin network is a smart system -- when hashrate drops, difficulty also drops. The goal of the network is to always maintain block discovery every 10 minutes.
That said, perhaps there is some delay between hash rate changes and difficulty changes.
@_date: 2014-09-24 00:09:40

Honestly, I think Coinbase security is pretty good. They're a serious VC-backed US company. They have offline cold storage, multisig, and most importantly -- insurance.
So at the very least, I feel confident that Coinbase probably won't lose my coins for me. Of course, you can still lose the coins yourself by being careless -- set up 2FA, have a strong password, and keep the majority of your coins in their multisig cold storage vaults.
I also like to keep part of my stash on Circle -- you know, just to increase security by diversifying. They don't offer cold storage or multisig, but they're also insured and fairly reputable.
Anyway, so I think you'll be fine.
Tip: both coinbase and circle have a flag in their settings to let you allow circle/coinbase to handle bitcoin links. I.e. there's a thing that makes it so you can click a bitcoin:// link and it opens in coinbase/circle automatically, pre-filling the bitcoin amount for your purchase.
@_date: 2014-12-02 07:09:47
Yeah, I never really understood the desire for this -- but it's certainly already available via bitreserve.org. You can dump a bunch of USD into them, then automagically spend it "as bitcoin" on demand without worrying about price changes. Hell, you can get them to hold gold for you and spend that as bitcoin. (They recently gave a bunch of their early adopters like 1$ in gold as a thanks.)
But, again... dunno why this is helpful beyond protecting you from price changes. But if you believe that bitcoin's value is going to go down and you should be protecting yourself from price changes... why not use USD?
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:42:55

Really would love to know how many BTC the US Gov't seized this time. Iirc, they're still holding like 50k BTC from last time.
I'd also like to know if the US Gov't had to agree to give out some of their "proceeds" to the other countries and agencies that they had to work with. They were making arrests in Ireland even. It'd be very personally gratifying if the FBI had to send 30% of their proceeds to their partners or something :-)
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:10:26
I have been thinking lately that btc needs to be ubiquitous first and foremost. Probably one of the best things you can do for it if you live in a tech hub is to approach all businesses and get them to accept it. For example, silicon valley. Basically no shops anywhere in Palo alto, Cupertino, or Mountain View accept btc, even though it makes sense. Everyone who lives there loves new tech and works in tech. If I could buy all my local stuff with btc, it'd be a huge deal. It's massive advertising, and means you're influencing all the people who make technology. Plus, if there is even a small, localized area where btc is everywhere, there is no need to convert.
Another thing that WILL happen is that all porn online should be primarily btc. Its a supermassive industry, and it makes crazy good sense. That alone would carry btc forever and increase demand. Even hillbillies would want some. Right now, it's weirdly hard to buy porn with btc.
@_date: 2014-10-14 03:00:45
Yeah, but it seems that then you cannot transfer this token again once you have it, correct? It actually looks like the ownership goes to the miner - or is that just the value that does?
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:00:41
I looked at the coinkite terminals before, but you gotta ask: why the fuck would I spend that much money for a dedicated terminal when I could instead buy an android tablet with a sweet mount for less? Even on sale, their prices are ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:24:12
This is a huge deal. The bay area is the perfect place to push bitcoins. If every second shop on the main drags of these small towns accepted btc, it would catch on for sure. There are a lot of nerds here.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:23:26
I think you're pretty safe, yes. Ideally, use their multisig "vault" service with 2FA. It's really quite a lot of security -- their vaults are usually offline, and multisig + 2FA makes it VERY hard to break into. Plus, Coinbase claims that their hot wallets are insured, so you probably won't lose anything in the case of a break-in. I also value that they're a venture capitalist funded California company.
@_date: 2015-01-28 20:28:57
Pretty long winded article, but skim down to the bottom section where she explains the problems with the current designs. That part's pretty good.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:46:22
Honestly bro, working for a company that has received millions in vc funding isn't really so great. You get a lot of pressure the "new owners" to behave the way the want you to. A lot of the time, that means prioritizing money over product. There is a growing number of entrepreneurs that would prefer to bootstrap things, and I honestly think that's best.
A lot of people seems to prioritize money over happiness.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:19:32
People are very much over-reacting to that stuff. Coinbase has some slightly over-zealous AI that watches your transactions and attempts to prevent ones that are seen as risky or against the US laws that the company is operating in.
Yes they can lock your account (well, multisig -- probably not), but they're very unlikely to do so permanently unless you're breaking some laws. It's largely a very good service.
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:22:58

Could you explain once again? I don't think I understood.
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:48:16
Perhaps the lack of fresh bitcoin supply causes too much demand, driving the price up. Then, who knows if the miners are making less than, same as, or more money? Would pools really shut down? I think the future is too uncertain to guess right now.

@_date: 2016-03-02 05:21:19
I don't understand what I was to gain from that article, though it was interesting. However, I'm talking about transaction volume, not minimum fee. Lowering this min fee shouldn't affect the network volume much, unless I misunderstand?
@_date: 2016-03-03 21:22:18
But there are optimizations in the works. There is an implementation called xtreme thinblocks which seems to compress the data really well, like to less than a quarter of the size, if I understand it right. We just need to get past this current roadblock and give time to segwit and other ideas. Still, even 2mb blocks will fill fast if the traffic grows quickly.

They've been running this farce for years now. What happen do the 2-4-8 proposal that Blockstream made a long time ago? What happened to the studies that showed that the network could easily handle 4mb today? What happened to promising to deliver a 2mb hf in the hong kong agreement?
Core keeps saying they'll do it, but they never actually seem to do it. Personally, I feel repeatedly misled and that this is probably another stalling tactic.
@_date: 2016-12-09 01:10:30
It's obvious that 1mb is just a magic number. It might as well be 900kb, 1100kb, 2mb, or 4mb. Nothing bad will happen if it's changed. Blocks won't instantly fill up.
A flexible cap voted on by the network seems like an obvious fix. After all, if it ever becomes large enough to be problematic, people will stop raising it.
@_date: 2015-08-11 08:48:33

Wow, we should all be really thankful to Theymos here for making such a polarizing and unpopular post. This'll help break the stalemate in the community quite nicely -- just probably not in the direction that he wanted.
Personally, I'm going to try out as my default bitcoin sub. Shame that people are still so bad at understanding that market forces allow for natural evolution, and that over-regulation is bad. Sound familiar?
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:52:18
I mean, you're not wrong -- stuff like Apple Pay is very appealing to people in 1st world countries. Bitcoin seems worthless, because consumers already have the features it provides.
However, I think that doesn't really matter that much. Bitcoin-the-currency is already massively successful in some sectors (drugs, international exchange, investment funds, porn). We'll continue to see it grow no matter what at this point -- I think that's pretty obvious, looking at the transaction rate and price charts.
So then who cares if it's not immediately useful in some parts of the world? The fact that it's going to grow, and open up a whole new world of internationalized transactions, already means that it's won. As it continues to become progressively more ubiquitous, it'll find use even amongst people that previously thought it was useless.
The other thing is that people in 1st world countries have a very narrow perspective on the realities of most of the world, when it comes to money. I was recently dating a very nice girl from the Philippines that just kept losing her shit about Amazon and the brand name stores we have everywhere. It's virtually impossible for her to buy a huge amount of products we take for granted here, especially without paying a huge premium. Don't even get me started on how much of a pain it was to go get gift cards in a pharmacy just to be able to convert her cash money into digital currency. Really feels like some 1800s shit. More than ever, we need globalized money without borders, and to kill these import-markup and currency exchange thieves.
TL;DR -- America &amp; co is really spoiled and doesn't need Bitcoin as much as most of the world does. As bitcoin continues to take off, the 1st world will start to benefit more too.

This statement is misleading. Adam proposed 2-4-8, to his credit. He did that some time after Gavin had been talking about the need for an increase and wrote BIP101. The quote you show above doesn't say that Gavin called "2mb ridiculous". It says that he thought 2mb wasn't enough.
Seems that Gavin is willing to compromise to get things rolling here. But the real question is, if they're in agreement that 2mb should happen, why hasn't it? Why not in Core?
@_date: 2016-09-23 20:26:55
Yes it's correct. If we go segwit, these must all upgrade in order to make the block size effectively 1.5mb:
* wallets - few days of coding
* miners - run new version
* exchanges - maybe lots of coding on a private bitcoind implementation + critical testing
* nodes - run new version
If we hard fork to 2mb (or better, an adaptive block size proposal paralleled by optimizations to current operations):
* miners - run new version
* nodes - run new version
* exchanges - switch to hard fork blockchain. Kraken demonstrated this as pretty easy with their ETC support
* wallets - switch to hard fork
So we can see that segwit is certainly a lot more effort to get less effective scaling before LN. Also bad is that the miners can decide unilaterally on the soft fork, without the support of the companies that actually have to do work to switch. And segwit is comparatively complex, so we will have to maintain a more convoluted protocol going forward.
In addition, compact blocks and Xthin have proved that simple tech optimizations allow for fast and cheap block propagation, even if the blocks are larger. Bitcoin.com's pool just relayed a block from America to China in milliseconds.
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:55:08
The magic of bitcoin is that you can actually have both -- you can have the security of a bank while holding all of your own funds
Ex. You create a service that (for a fee) runs an AI which basically just vets your transactions and tries to protect them and prevent fraud.
I send my money into this AI with the real destination address of the product I want to purchase. The AI can warn me if it thinks its unsafe. If a dispute occurs, the service can provide insurance against the money I spent (and pay me back if I get robbed). I wouldn't need to trust this intermediary with my funds, since bitcoin is so liquid and flexible that I can send funds in on-demand.
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:08:05
I still very much recommend Coinbase's cold storage vault. The amount of blood samples needed to transact any significant amount of money from my account is very high.
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:51:14
That's funny. I had the exact same conversation in highschool when Wikipedia was first coming out. My English teacher was a real hater back then. "Anyone can edit it, you can't trust that" "full of lies" "never going to overtake Brittanica" -- I think one teacher even defaced a page to prove that point.
I wonder if he ever thinks about that conversation and goes, "Oh. I guess distributed, collaborative, open systems really are the best."
Not to toot my own horn too much, but I've been remarkably accurate in foreseeing which technologies will become dominant. I basically put all of my real life skill points into learning computers, Linux, open source, and electric cars. Now I live in Silicon Valley, and wonder sometimes how I managed to make such lucky choices when I was young.
Though it's not really rocket surgery, is it? Just support the technologies that are the most honest, fair, and organic. That way of thinking is the real revolution, but people are still fixating on the individual examples.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:07:39
It's something that I could stand to research better, but the tldr opinion I have is simply that the current system is too complex. There are so many tax evasion schemes as a result of complex regulation. Ex. that one political candidate that ran against Obama that was found to pay only 14% tax despite being very wealthy. Or Roth fund rollover from 401k.
My opinion is that simple, clear rules like "we only tax income and its always 20%" are the ones that cause minimal corruption. Plus, taxing the 1% heavier has done little to balance out the wealth inequality.

Y'mean that routing that was conveniently left out of the white paper and nobody knows how it'll work? Probably requires well-known centralized hubs to find routes.
This is a good case for my original question: "why do I want to use a separate network?" If LN is effectively just moving space to another blockchain, how is that less problematic that just scaling bitcoin itself? It won't be less net traffic or computation.




When did I sign up for that? I don't want to use unproven new tech over something that used to work well for 8 years until the capacity ran out.


Right, and the solution to this problem will be... Raise the bitcoin blocksize.




I disagree. Keeping your funds in an unproven non-bitcoin blockchain is risky behaviour to start with. Bugs in LN threaten my bitcoins as well. Not to mention that the bitcoin wil be otherwise undependable while it is in LN, so if you need the btc for rent or shapeshift, you'll have to close out your channels.


This is the most infuriating part. LN's endgame is for bitcoin to not be used. Eventually a time will come where bitcoin blockspace is running out even with LN. At this point, rather than scaling bitcoin, the LN devs are likely to go "eh, let's just split away and solve the issue in LN". In effect stealing bitcoin's userbase by moving people over to LN and then cutting off ties when bitcoin becomes unusable.
Again: why do I want a different network than bitcoin's?




Thanks, at least we can talk.

You *could* do that but that's effectively just using something else *instead* of bitcoin.
That blockspace doesn't vanish, it's simply moved to LN. You're no longer using bitcoin if you don't regularly sync back.
Also, until you sync back, you don't truly have your money. I think most people and companies will sync fairly often to ensure they really have their money.
The other thing is that LN channels are one-to-one and must remain open. Personally, I dont send 100 btc to the same person on the regular. My usage is more like "send a little bit to random company just once". LN doesn't help with this until I open channels to all those ppl. Each channel open is a btc transaction. Each close is a btc transaction.
So yes, I get it, and blockspace is still an issue.

Why do I want a new network instead of bitcoin, and how will it solve capacity issues if it has to sync back to btc anyway?
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:39:05
Sadly, I think capacity overload won't be a "problem":
We are unlikely to see too much usage growth, because every time it happens (ex. Chinese rally recently), users get a terrible experience. I personally recently had to wait 4 hours for a simple transaction.
So as long as bitcoin struggles every time we get a small spike, it won't really grow much. Users tend to flee when tech they are evaluating seems unreliable. Call it spam, but at the end of the day, legit users still just can't transact easily / quickly.
So I guess it's kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. Bitcoin won't have the problem of scaling too fast when effective blocksize is low. It just won't scale more than it can, because users will start turning away more as the backlog grows.

No, I broke *his* analogy. Bitcoin isnt like the internet, so it's a lie to say that "because the internet has layers, bitcoin can scale with layers too." The internet didn't scale with layers. The layers only added features.
I agree, LN effectively creates more blockspace by simply using a separate chain and hopefully syncing back to bitcoin less often than every transaction.
But the way LN works is that channels must be opened and closed between participants. So if I have 100 friends that I want to send 1btc to, I actually have to perform 100 open operations and then 100 closes. All this data must live in btc blockspace.
I.e. we will likely still hit the block size limit in Bitcoin.

Wow so you're saying that the way to keep bitcoin safe from state attack is by keeping the market cap low? So that bitcoin doesn't revolutionize finance?
Keeping bitcoin down won't keep cryptocurrency as a concept down. It just means that another coin will eventually exceed bitcoin.
So we keep bitcoin safe by ensuring it's demise?


So changing a constant from 1mb to 2mb is "dangerous experimentation" while implementing a whole new transaction format (segwit) and new (side) blockchain (LN) is "safe". Whoa
@_date: 2016-10-29 21:24:04


Several problems there:
* Alpha software
* I didn't say it wouldn't be functional, only that it'd cause centralized hubs to form. The decentralized part is likely impossible on the other hand, and that's not a matter of "lets fine tune our algorithm".




I mean, you have a nice analogy there, but Gavin fixed that exact issue in his original Classic HF version. It doesn't rely on segwit. And segwit's blocksize cap increase is measely -- to a tune of 1.8mb total on average. At current growth rate, we are likely to hit that cap sooner rather than later, necessitating us pushing transactions to... lightning network.


I mean, here you're just getting kind of offensive, but yes, I would need to use it. Because Segwit only increases the blocksize by an average of 1.8mb, so if I want to keep transacting, I'd have to use LN. Bitcoin's own blocksize will continue to be impaired.


These fears you have are erased once you learn how the system works. You just dont understand how the system works. I understand this because its not simple. You cannot expect to read a cryptographers publishing and to understand their high-level mathematics.
Now you're just making claims about what I do or don't know here. And Maxwell has repeatedly stated that LN can work without SW. So lets just keep the aggression to a minimum, eh?




 isn't so useful
My point remains:
* Raising the blocksize right now is safe. We even had code from Gavin years ago that fixed the sighashing issue you raised.
* LN is not bitcoin. It carries its own risks. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is very well proven tech.

You are correct about the internet, but it's not quite the same with bitcoin.
Layer 0 in the internet is of course the hardware. The cables we use might be phone lines, capable, of, let's say 200mbps.
The TCP layer is built on those lines, and it has to do some extra work to provide the features it has, like being able to sequence packets of data and re-send them if they don't arrive. But what it **can't** do it go faster than 200mbps. It can only go slower, because you can't push more than 200mbps over the physical cables. (UDP exists because TCP can be a bit slow, but UDP also can't do better than raw electron-in-cable speeds).
On top of TCP, we build HTTP. HTTP provides new features: sending and requesting websites primarily. It does different stuff, but it can't run faster than TCP.
In the same way, bitcoin right now is capped at 1mb blocks, meaning 1mb of transaction space is available every 10 min. We can use this space a little more efficiently right now, but it's still limited.
Level 2 networks that sync to bitcoin can *offer new features* but they cannot increase bitcoin's capacity to store data. Even with LN, channels must be opened and closed regularly, which causes bitcoin transactions. If LN gets enough usage, bitcoin will hit capacity again.
But my question again becomes: why do we want to use a new network instead of bitcoin? Bitcoin used to be able to do everything we wanted. Since when do we need a whole new (side) network to simply do transactions?
@_date: 2016-10-26 07:07:28
We all knew about the problem of network congestion years in advance. Satoshi proposed a solution years and years back. Gavin posted about the problem when we were only at 30% capacity. It's obvious that only so many transactions can fit in limited blockspace.
Why has the dev team allowed this to happen? I get that it's "open source" or whatever, but if this was a dev team at a real company... would they have jobs?
I'm okay with differences of opinion about *how* to scale bitcoin -- but the fact that it's gotten this bad at all is horrifying. Why is the network on fire? How is this good for anyone?

Not entirely true. My Coinbase multisig gives me a key, them a key, and the third key is password encrypted. So in effect, I do own the keys, since Coinbase doesn't know that 3rd key and can't decrypt it -- but I still get the comfort of Coinbase. I also think the privacy concerns are somewhat bogus because of the public block chain. Sure, Coinbase can identify me as the wallet holder -- but more and more services will do that as you use bitcoin. Ex, Overstock and Massdrop know who I am. The forensics for finding out that I hold that address isn't complicated.
