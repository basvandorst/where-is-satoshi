Then how exactly people store btc safely?
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:19:25
I got a welcome email when I opened the wallet but didn't get a backup file.
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:35:05
Yes the address shows the correct amount. Mycelium says 'The password entered is not correct'.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:54:43
I just opened request  on zendesk.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:19:21
Yes it sucks and I don't understand how it could happen this easily. Don't blockchain have any security measures?!
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:14:17
I managed to guess the password. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:01:54


To do what?


it is.
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:26:24
I used bitaddress.org.
I'm trying to decrypt it there and I'm getting 'Incorrect passphrase'. If it's not the right password then why does the blockchain app give 2 different error messages?

Then 2FA should be mandatory on blockchain. The fact that the malware resides on the client's computer rather than on their servers is insignificant. By not requiring 2FA they're compromising their wallets' security in favor of usability. I'm not supposed to know the ins and outs of security when I open a wallet on their website.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:25:13
No. I didn't know my coins are sure to be stolen without 2FA. I would assume 2FA would be mandatory on blockchain to protect laymen like myself. I wasn't aware that anyone who isn't a security expert automatically the easily-hackable-wallet option by default on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-03-12 17:06:42


Please. Blockchain.info's website didn't make it clear that without 2FA I might as well be throwing my money away. How do I know that what I understand now is enough to 'understand what I'm doing'? How do you know that your 2FA won't be compromised somehow tomorrow and it'll turn out that you 'didn't understand what you were doing'? Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:17:07
Yes I got a wallet backup email when I signed up. No I didn't have 2FA enabled. If theft is this easy without 2FA then why isn't 2FA mandatory? How did they steal my btc anyway?!
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:09:23
Yes, an exclamation mark. Why?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:17:40
Is there an email login history for gmail?
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:47:06
I'm not the one who should ensure proper security. Is it your responsibility to protect the funds you deposit into your bank?
@_date: 2014-04-23 21:29:43
I also remember getting automatic email backups for previous wallets, but not this one for some reason.
So they reset your 2FA and everything was fine?
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:03:22
No I used Chrome.
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:00:22
Okay thanks!
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:38:27
So you're estimating it will generally keep going down till it hits 0.5 and stay there?
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:14:53
They're down to 2.18. From 5.
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:39:49
no, I'm the one trusting you to pay for me while I transfer you my btc
@_date: 2013-09-07 14:28:30


Drop of over 50%






@_date: 2013-09-07 14:21:05
Why did they drop so much in value?
