Kraken does NEVER work then the Bitcoin or Ether price moves significantly. My stoploss at €949 is still in the order (currently the BTC is at €925 at Kraken)

Are you a norwegian? I guess so, by looking at your reddit account name.Then you can buy/sell Bitcoin from Sturle ( He has a 1% fee.

I opened an account at Bitstamp today. I can swear I've seen "Error 502" and "Error 504" more than 1000 times at Kraken. If this continues, Kraken will completely stop working within a couple of months. Bitstamp replied within hours after I verified. And that on a Saturday!

The B2X fork is not to be taken lightly. Honestly, I am worried. It's not free money, it's a sivil war. But most probably it will end good.

Worst case: 51% attack from the B2X miners?

Kraken has serious problems. The trade engine is extremely slow. You can easily spend 10 to 20 minutes just to add an order, because you will almost always get an error message when you try to do that.

About Santander launches the first blockchain-based international money transfer service
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:52:21
Is it the news from Santander?

I would recommend to buy Bitcoins instead of cloud mining. Cloud mining is most often not profitable
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:42:31
It is LTC. ETH will be added later
