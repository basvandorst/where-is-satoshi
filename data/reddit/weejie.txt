I like the Coin Of Sale POS, but had a few questions: 1) is there an option to get the QR code on the receipt rather than scanning a smartphone or tablet? 2) How does the smart device talk to the printer (wifi)? 3) Are you able to handle tips?

I bought a product yesterday using bitcoin, but the transaction was cancelled because the product was no longer in stock.  I was able to check out and pay using bitcoin.

Does the Coinkite terminal also process credit/debit cards?
@_date: 2014-03-24 21:11:51
Were you actually approached by authorities to audit the process?  I ask because I am about to put an ATM in the US.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:32:15
here is how we do it in Reno (  We don't run into issues of scale yet, but integrating into the CC terminal would be nice.

In the future I think it would be best to state where you got your information from.  Was it a source inside bitpay? Did you base it on some calculations? And if so where did you get the data?  I liked the story but without some sort of idea where you get your information it can't be taken seriously.  Newsbtc, coindesk, and all these other news sites for bitcoin are viewed as biased just because of the domain name alone.

I tend to learn all things the hard way, but I was fortunate to only have a  small portion in Gox.  Now I place an even smaller percentage in exchanges and only day-trade using robots :-D

Right on.  Any progress on the tip feature?
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:13:19
I think that would require more dev and user training. Maybe their starting slow. My experience purchasing via the marketplace went through but was buggy.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:54:10
This is awesome!

Love your site.  Is your POS an app or a physical device?
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:32:45
Square marketplace is different than the square devices that plug into smartphones.  Vendors using the device cannot accept bitcoin at this point in time.

Thanks for listening...I've calmed down a bit since I posted that rant. It doesn't really matter if we tweet out to Pataginia or not. In the grand scheme it will probably be like someone in 1996 telling the CEO that they should put up a website Patagonia.com.  On a side note saving costs on PCI compliance is a nice benefit to using BTC that I don't see discussed too often.  There might be an opportunity to target small to midsize businesses being audited or fined by PCI. That's a real motivation to switch to BTC. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 06:26:59
So I would assume the bitfury guys are knowledgable on bitcoin, but can improved hardware really speed up the mining process?  I was under the impression that the difficulty automatically adjusts regardless of hardware so that 2140 will always be the estimated date of the last bitcoin minting.  Can chip improvements really change this?

My biggest concern is a bug in the core protocol causing a vulnerability or multiple forks in the blockchain.  Forks can be resolved as we have seen before, but it still scares me.  Software bugs are a fact of life.  There is no such thing as perfect software IMO.  The challenges is how problematic will they be.  Heartbleed bug in OpenSSL was frightening to say the least.  I guess the main thing that helps me sleep at night is knowing the software is open source with a smart community behind it.

I use skydrive to backup my wallet.dat file.  Before I upload the wallet I encrypt it using TrueCrypt to some other random file type.  So I may name the encrypted file SnoopDizzle.mp3 and upload it.  The process is 1) create an encrypted folder/file using TrueCrypt 2) copy wallet.data to encrypted folder/file 3) upload folder/file to skydrive (or preferred online backup)

Nope.  Saw them at the btc job fair and asked for an update on my invite.  The Circle employee then advised he would send it through then *types on keyboard*...still nothing =\

Aurora coin is still functioning.  The did have a fork, but so has bitcoin in the past.  I am more for BTC rather than alts.  I believe the argument for bitcoin versus alternative cryptocrurrencies is dev support and experience.

Are you able to tell the POS to give tips to different wallets?  For example, the main wallet is used by the owner, but the waiter wants to be able to have a wallet for tips.
@_date: 2014-01-03 20:27:38
I agree with you here.  It is natural to want to spend the BTC rather than hoard.  I'm not talking about cars and houses, but simple everyday things like food, drinks, or other $20 and less purchases.  Bitcoin then spreads to more individuals and they in turn spend it.  Rinse and repeat.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:09:00

Yep - they are using the coinbase app on android mobile devices.  The coinbase kiosk mode is pretty sweet!

Lol. My buddy starts to ask a gas station attendant if he has heard of bitcoin while there is a giant line behind him.  Attendant gives him a look and says "are you f*cking kidding me. Get out of here man." Timing fail.

I thought about this a little more.  I suppose giving someone your private key is a possible method of payment without a smartphone, but the market is too volatile for this solution to be feasible.

Let me know if you want any help. I'm spreading the word on bitcoin, but doing so on a grassroots level in Reno (  So far it's been a mixed bag, but some business owners have been very receptive to the idea. I am scheduled to speak with a few reporters...we'll see how that goes.

Howdy - thanks for the support! Im the dude who got them to accept. I would also point out Mayberry Barbers and Tahoe Tech as companies in Reno/Tahoe that accept BTC too. I'm heading to Mid-Town businesses next along with the food truck community here. I encourage everyone local to go spend BTC at these businesses! Show them your support!
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:51:56
You cannot send bitcoins without some device connected to the internet.  There is not a way to extract bitcoins from a wallet.  That said, smartphone is the most convenient, but you could use a laptop, tablet, or  PC.

The challenge with larger businesses is integrating into their existing point of sale system.  I was thinking about a 3rd party add on for existing systems like Micros or Aloha.  That said I will try and get them on the list.  I love me some Pegs!

Fun event ya'll.  We need to do it again soon.  Here's the Channel 4 news coverage: 
@_date: 2013-12-08 07:11:59
I began by asking if they have heard about bitcoin.  Generally the answer is no, so I first explain it is simply another payment method that only takes a 1% fee.  From there I explain services like Coinbase or BitPay.  At this point they want to know what a bitcoin is.
I think it's important that you are a loyal customer because people need to have an open mind.  I try to stay away from the technical details and use a lot of metaphors to explain.  I compare the mining process to finding a 4 digit bike lock combo if you don't know it.  You begin at 0,0,0,0 and if it doesn't work you then try 0,0,0,1 and so on.  
Businesses I talk to tend to think I'm trying to sell them something.  Usually they will do research themselves and ask folks they trust.  Mayberry Barbers, for example, spoke with their accountant, some accountants they cut hair for, and did a few google searches.  When I returned the barber hit me with question after question until he understood.  After about three visits discussing bitcoin I asked him if he wanted me to pay him in bitcoin.  He said yes and has become another bitcoin evangelist.
