You clearly don’t understand technology or innovation or your keen eye for good investment would’ve led you to riches instead of a sub on Reddit proclaiming that we’re all idiots stuck in a bubble.
I don’t understand how that feels because I got on the bus, not as soon as I should’ve but soon enough. To me, you’re the one in the bubble. One made behind closed doors under a veil of democracy. This is not about become wealthy. It’s about being free.
Just remember that by using government shill bucks, you’ll always be at the bottom of the pyramid. You are owned by the banks and it is so sad that you refuse to pick up and use the key to your own prison cell.

I find it odd that you consider 9 year old technology a fad like beanie babies or find it possible to compare it to a central bank issued currency.
Of course that goes back to how you don’t really understand money. Or bubbles for that matter. The Bitcoin bubble lacks a critical component of all bubbles. Market Saturation. 
Sure in this little sub here we’re all hyped up. What about when you push away from the screen? Is the guy at your local petrol station stocking up on Bitcoin? What about the local cobbler? Maybe the butcher at your local delicatessen is a bitcoin bug. More than likely they are only focused stocking up on the longest lasting bubble in history, that of state run and freely printed government shill bucks.
All national currency will eventually be as valuable as the Iraqi Dinar or even the abandoned Zimbabwean currency. That is to say that government backed money will be worthless eventually. This is nothing more than a testament to the ability of the issuing authority to freely print money at whatever point meets their whimsy.
Just remember that the Wright Brothers we’re scoffed at, Galileo was nearly killed, people thought computers were nonsense, the automobile was initially outlawed, and that the internet was a fad. World changing technology often faces struggles and naysayers. 
I’d be willing to bet that if someone offered you a chance to buy into the first shares of Google when they were first made available, you’d tell whoever it was that they were a scam artist. 
Your problem is vision.
Also, beanie babies still sell for upwards of $500,000. So...fad...bubble.... or did you miss another bus?

The wallet you choose makes all the difference. For large transfers, I use electrum just because I don’t want to download the entire chain onto my daily use computer. I know it’s frowned upon in these parts but my mobile wallet is BitPay as it has a great deal of functionality that I desire. The last thing I did with that wallet was a transfer to paper wallets which cost me a fee that was about 10% of the amount transferred. But that’s on me because I’m the one who authorized it. 
Don’t quit crypto. Don’t be like the guy who told the Wright Brothers that they were foolish. Don’t be the guy who thought that the internet was a “fad”, don’t walk away from the future. You already know more about crypto and have learned through real experience more than a huge majority of the world.

You rant about the national debt, are you aware that indebtedness is what gives your statist shill bucks their value? If we don’t owe another nation money....what gives that money value? There has to be an incentive and “the full faith and credit of Uncle Sam” ain’t enough for me.
You fear Bitcoin. You’re afraid that it will undermine the nation state. I can tell that you’re a statist, probably a very patriotic one too. Don’t worry, Bitcoin will eventually crush the foundation upon which the nation state has built its power...slavery through the forced use of centralized currency. Ironically it will free you even if you don’t support it. 
The fact that you like silver is a testament to your lack of faith in the government run monetary system but also demonstrates that you don’t know how to cut loose the shackles.

I am seeing this. I’m seeing people buying in to an asset that they don’t understand at such a pace that I thought I’d never see.
I’m also seeing a fear of missing out. 
Also I’m seeing the slow adoption of Bitcoin and it’s acceptance by financial institutions. 
The people who want to get rich right now will be disappointed...unless they bought a lot. And because they’ll have to wait a while. It took nine years to get to this point. Bitcoin will go down again, probably much lower, before it goes up again. 
I’ve been holding for years. I remember the ups and downs. The key is patience and use. I used bitcoin to pay for surgery for my dog. And I paid for Christmas this year with Bitcoin.

Strange, spent my last semester of electronics engineering undergraduate work researching blockchain. The only area I didn’t really explore was the hardware and its programming. 
I spent quite a bit of time reading about blockchain and how it was developed including the work that was done before Satoshi that he implemented in his programmatic iteration.
I also spent the majority of my time studying how blockchain works, but not how to write the code to establish a new one. 
The conclusion that I can to is that it is unnecessary to program new blockchains. The Bitcoin blockchain is pretty damn perfect and one only needs to fork it to achieve what they desire.

The insignificant ones are those who piled into Bitcoin in the last year or so and think they are qualified to talk about it at all.
You can tell who they are by their audacity and willingness to blame others for their own actions and lack of information. 
I was unfortunate enough to buy into BTC four years ago. The money fire has been horrendous. It was very hard watching BTC crash up all the way to where it is now. I’d really be kicking myself if I’d bought in eight years ago. I mean those guys are probably broke as fuck right now.

“Here’s the deal, bitcoin will never replace currency.”  -You in your OP
Monetary policy is not based in science. It’s based in mathematics and history. 
As for history all it should take is a quick google search but since you seem lazy here are a few examples of government backed currencies failing:
1. The German Papiermark 
2. The Argentinian Peso
3. The Zimbabwean Dollar
4. The Peruvian Sol 
There are others but fundamentally when a central bank inflated its money supply or enacts “easy money” policy they run the risk of not being able to control inflation in the future. The difficulty being that the monetary policy was enacted because of slow growth in the economy. As an example you can look to the Eurozone, where interest rates have been held below zero for several years despite a recovering global economy. If the ECB were to tighten the money supply by selling bonds and increasing interest rates it could even further slow the growth of an economy that is still struggling from the last “Great Recession”.  Therefore a lack of significant growth and because of FISCAL policy made by the government the ECB cannot enact MONETARY policy to keep their currency from sliding against their trade partners. What would happen to the Euro, should another recession occur? What measures can the ECB take to prevent the collapse of a currency that is already at a negative yield? 
Don’t try to debate economics with me, you aren’t the only one who has graduated highs school and gone on to college although I wouldn’t say you’ve been to a very good one as you lack knowledge of history and an innovative mind.

Your entire point is based on the flimsy premise that central bank controlled currencies will never die off. Even though there are many examples of it happening.
When you start off a point by eliminating the possibility of an alternative scenario you paint yourself into a corner.

Try thinking about how much your monthly groceries cost in bitcoin terms. Over time, the amount you spend on stuff will go down unlike fiat where inflation and continual growth and borrowing expectations create fake wealth propped up by debt.

It would have been a shame if I dumped money into BTC since 2014. I’d have sooooo much money right now.

But I’m glad to say that it pays to be informed.
Nocoiners will be left behind when the next run occurs two to three years from now. And this belief that the over inflated stock market is going to continue to provide returns without causing a devaluation of the dollar is naive at best.

Just because you don’t like something doesn’t mean it’s not factual.
I could give you a litany of reasons why everyone should have bitcoin, but I won’t. I’ll save my time and energy. 
You’re right. Bitcoin is useless. So useless that it went from a value of $0.09 to over $9000 in just ten years. It’s so pointless that it is traded for goods and services around the world. It is so fallible that no single government knows how to treat it, handle it, or stop it from undermining the hierarchical structure that has been in place for a millennia. 
Don’t buy bitcoin.
# 1 it’s just some computer money that people around the world agree has value, 
# 2 it’s gonna crash again, proof: it already went all the way from $0.09 to $20k and the down to $9k what a total scam.
# 3 it’s so incredibly inconvenient to use with my cellphone, there’s only like 15 mobile wallets and who even has a cellphone anyways.
So really, just don’t buy it. I mean who wants privacy from the banks or government or whatever. How will they know what I’m spending my money on if I don’t have to ask permission to use my money first.
You’re so right about being jumped on for the whole only being on for two days thing.  You clearly jumped into a subreddit with an intent to be a contributor of well thought out content. You weren’t acting like a fucking cunt at all.

Stocks, speculative because I’m buying believing they’ll go up.

ETF, speculative because I’m betting that the underlying assets increase in value.
People trade all of these things, therefore NO ONE is an investor.
BTW, Bitcoin has provide led me with better annualized returns than my aggressively distributed 401k. Good thing it’s only speculative.

Or you could simply buy a drill and destroy his computer and burn any thumb drives you can get your hands on.

Generally speaking, the best way to decrease fiscal deficits is to raise revenue not decrease revenue. Cost cutting is also a factor but when half of every tax dollar goes to the military industrial complex that runs the nation, programs that people actually need will be disposed of or drastically cut. Education is one such program that has received massive cuts to funding in America. Which explains why people resort to calling successful nations “socialist” or ad hominem attacks, it’s because they lack the critical thinking skills that are developed in institutions of higher learning. 
America is keeping its citizens stupid in order to more easily enslave them with debt. They feed the people the American Dream, which requires backbreaking labor and hearty debt, or winning the lottery.
It is a well known fact that people who live in “socialist” nations are happier and wealthier than the average American.
America is the best at killing its own people, having high infant mortality rates, and incarceration of its own citizens. America is not free.

It hasn’t “always” worked. You should read more about world reserve currencies.
You show concern for making more of a thing that is supposed to be money. Why are you not concerned with the ability of those who control the dollar to just print them out of thin air? Are you not offended that the process of money printing makes the money you have less valuable? The governments actions, in that regard, actually work against your own self interest. Unless you like having a depreciating assented as your store of value.

You should look at what happened to the price of physical silver when the futures derivative was introduced.
It is almost the same exact thing. 
Just because the futures contracts aren't settled in BTC doesn't mean that the guys on the street can't leverage both sides. All they have to do is trade margins on Bitfinex. Think about it...open a short contract, then dump a fuckton of BTC...profit. Open a long contract, pump the shit out of it and then profit. rinse and repeat.

Because of the intelligence required to articulate how bitcoin functions and the intelligence required to understand how it works, I would say that one who dismisses the greatest technological achievement of the last 20 years is ignorant, not those who buy into it. If you don’t understand what I mean and why, you should read up on how the technology behind bitcoin has progressed over the last 70 years.
Peer to peer “money trading” aka economics has been a staple of human history for a millennia, why would that change? Right now we trade paper with peoples faces on it and we used to trade gold coins and before that seashells and feathers. Who would’ve thought that the government would outlaw private ownership of gold? But they did and they made that bullshit paper you so revere as valuable in the process.
You shouldn’t invest. You lack vision and deserve to be a have not.

You can collect fees by routing payments using a lightning node.
There are a lot of good articles out there about how to do it.
Eclair is probably the easiest but some implementations allow you to run your node on auto pilot where it seeks to create channels between nodes so that payments can be routed in the most efficient manner.
Just do some reading about it, there are some good medium articles and even a tutorial on how to run an lnd implementation on a raspberry pi

Cash is worthless if the government issuing it ceases to exist.
Silver is barely useful as a form of currency as most of it is used in scientific and medical fields. Also, how much silver does one need? What is the unit of barter?
Same for gold except it is centralized already.
Ammunition has a shelf life and is heavy.
The amount of water you need for a day weighs about 4 lbs or ~2kilos. That is heavy and no one wants to carry it.
If the internet goes out world wide for a week or more you have to worry about all of the above. 
If the electricity goes out, how will you access your cash? Go to the ATM? 
What does the vault at your bank look like? Does it have a little room with your name on it? And a table with all of your money sitting there? 
No, your dollars are ones and zeros too. Only they can be infinitely devalued by continuously printing more of them into circulation.
The bitcoin network is broadcast from space. Which bank has that level of network connectivity?

There has to be a set channel capacity and the other person has to be connected to the network in some way or one of the two parties has to be operating a lightning node. The software that acinq released has the capability but I haven’t fiddled with that yet.

I just reread our entire discourse and you’ve asked two questions, one of which I answered with one sentence and the other is just basic knowledge of bitcoin and it operation.
You haven’t really clearly stated a question, perhaps you’re not sure what you’re asking.
If you mean to ask what the people are who sell the derivative products based on bitcoin, they would be clearinghouses. 
The only way that this could be accomplished is if the clearinghouse had a proprietary layered application for these derivatives that would allow them to be tied to the blockchain. Similar to lightning the derivative transactions would be required to be recorded at some point in the ledger. Again, this is where the node operators and miners serve as a bank in that they are maintaining the network and ledger. 
We’re these derivatives not settled on chain they would be a scam and illegitimate. Thus proving that the clearinghouse is nothing more than a scam. 
FWIW there is absolutely nothing stopping a present day bank from doing any of this. Because Bitcoin is open source and second layer applications have proven to be successful it is perfectly reasonable to produce a derivative product of bitcoin. 
Also, it seems like you need to read Mastering Bitcoin, it’s available for free on GitHub.

No. I’ve been dealing with skeptics for more than 4 years now. And what for?
Imagine your checking account. What does it look like, physically? Is it a big room filled with cash? Or is it a ledger made up of ones and zeros held by a bankster in a shitty suit and regulated by a bunch of shady fucks?
If it the former, congrats but you still own fiat which can be printed on the whim of a central bank. This devaluing your holdings.
If it’s the latter, well, you live in reality.

The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) It is necessary to carry out a detailed analysis on various issues such as problems. "
However, there is a high possibility that taxation on profits of virtual currency transactions will not be realized for the time being. Kim said, "Bitcoin taxation is under investigation rather than being reviewed yet," but "it has not progressed enough to put it into the amendment bill next year." "I think it is still an early stage of research analysis," he said repeatedly, "not enough to fix tax laws next year."

Miners aren’t the only ones who secure the network. Nodes also secure the network. See Bitcoin Core. This presentation also assumes that bitcoin fees are going to rise. That all depends on the user and how knowledgeable they are when it comes to fees and how urgently they want to move their coins. I moved ~$42k the other day for a little more than $2.
If as is stated very plainly, the miners are the only ones supporting the big block chain, then whoever makes the miners would control the market. See Jihan Wu and Bitmain. And that would stand to make that chain extremely centralized. Also, the “specialized” hardware required to run a lightning node is no more complex than mining hardware. The “vault” is just the BTC held by the node to process payments on the chain and has bee proposed that some small fees be paid to those who run nodes to further remove the abilities of miner manufacturers to manipulate the chain.

It’s not even actual bitcoin. It’s a derivative. They’ll be able to short it but because it will be indexed to BTC but it can’t make the value of BTC go down.

Bitcoin is indeed 10 years old. 
Perhaps you need to do a little more research before you attempt to make statements like that.
I agree that Bitcoin was born in the depths of one of the worst financial crises of the last 100 years and that it has outperformed EVERY SINGLE ASSET over that time. Thank you for your acquiescence.
I too look forward to seeing how this deflationary currency performs during the next financial crisis which seems to be setting upon us currently. Looks like another year or two of uncertainty in the stock market coupled with ballooning corporate and government debt, domestic and foreign, reducing much of the gains of the last ten years before we see more monetary and fiscal policy that ultimately led to the rise of Bitcoin. 
The only difference, of course, will be that the starting price of bitcoin will be in the thousands of dollars as opposed to pennies. 
Given past performance would you recommend that I open up a 2% yield savings account? Or perhaps I should find a nice mutual fund with a respectable Beta? That way I can either just barely outpace inflation or better yet do slightly better than the average stock market return while taking excess risk in companies that are as corrupt as the governments that allow them to operate.
I think I’ll pass and just buy more Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:02:51
Irony then that the first successful blockchain was built for use as a way to store transactional data of cryptographically generated hashes. 
Blockchain exists because of Bitcoin. It too has value especially in areas of legal matters and governance. Imagine your votes stored on an immutable ledger and verified by the use of your cryptographically secure identification.
Just because there is a blockchain, doesn’t mean there needs to be a token or coin. One is enough. 
Denying that blockchain outside of Bitcoin has value, is rampant idiocy.

All computers running in a hospital to secure the blockchain that stores your medical records. With the incentive of receiving money for doing their job as health care providers. 
The monetization of BTC and the block reward as a result of winning the competition to find blocks is what makes the incentive. It is also what ensures that all the miners follow the rules, in theory. 
In an enterprise blockchain the blockchain is a utility and as is such can be limited in terms of network size and who participates. In a retail store all POS cpus can run a miner at a low speed in the background to secure the sales and inventory data. Wall mart wouldn’t want you mining their blockchain, it wouldn’t be beneficial for them to relinquish control to a potentially more powerful computing node.
Enterprise blockchain is where networks do not go beyond the borders of the organization using them. 
Edit- I can go into a shared database and change the file if I have permission. Even if the other nine nodes disagree. Blockchain prevents that, it is not a database.

I'm working a thesis on blockchain as a whole. Figured that I would solicit for any missing information that should be covered for the average Joe, who doesn't know about blockchain technology and what it can offer.
Thank you in advance Reddit for all of your insightful and useful responses.
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:18:02
Based on your statements I’d recommend you familiarize yourself with NIST FIPS 180-4, the standard that outlines the cryptographic functions that are used to secure blockchains. Then I would suggest reading NIST draft 8082 for information regarding how blockchain functions from a security standpoint. Some of what you’re saying alludes to a fundamental misunderstanding of what blockchain does and how it works, comparing blockchain to a google drive for instance.
In your examples if your medical records were compromised then you lost your own information. Think of it like a private key to a wallet. 
For everything else the ability to take a pdf in pure data form and hash it into a 256 bit cypher and adding a time stamp to it prevents anyone from downloading it and changing the document with adobe pro. The initial work for this type of idea was actually done as a way to aid in the prevention of copyright infringement during the late 90’s. 
Imagine your ID has a chip with your unique keys. You vote with that chip, access your finances, store record of property ownership, etc. 
Also, I don’t trust the government. I don’t trust lawyers, banks, doctors, judges, policemen, et al. The authority vested in people in these positions is easily corrupted and their actions need to be visible and verifiably in compliance with the law. 
Blockchain is not entirely about privacy. It is about security and the immutability of data stored on it. 
Bitcoin isn’t about privacy either it’s about anonymity and the ability to transact with unknown and untrusted parties without the need for a “trusted” third party.

The more places the blockchain is stored to be validated from the better off the network is. The Bitcoin Core client allows for signaling consensus as well.

LN is the peer to peer function for small transactions. Not everyone’s t shirt purchase needs to be on the blockchain. But, when you send BTC to or take it from the LN network it is settled on chain. The fees for that are whatever your priority is and the miners will be encouraged to mine those fees. 
The fee issue won’t be a bother to the miners until all BTC are mined, when the blocks will only contain a few subsidy.  I imagine that by that time the network will be so energy efficient and the mining so distributed that large mining firms will compete again with home owners mining with smart devices.
Utopian, I know. But imagine the security of a monetary system where each user both mines and runs payment processing from their home. Glorious.

Yeah let’s build a power generation station without planning for growth. Good Idea!
Trying to understand what you’re hung up on and I think it’s that you’re not considering the possibility that Bitcoin mining can subsidize clean energy.
Again, your framed point makes it difficult for you to approach the subject with a critical thought pattern. 
A rudimentary project cost analysis using Net Present Value would be the ultimate determinant of a project of this nature. Using data like cost of capital and expected revenue stream or cash flows. Given that power stations generally have customer bases built in, the annuity required to pay down the project as quickly as possible would be known. If, growth were factored in, it is more than reasonable to plan a power station and operate it at maximum capacity even if there weren’t enough users as the excess power can be used to mine and sell BTC to reduce the payoff time and still have a utility station capable of producing enough power for the future.

Look at that. 
You read only the title of an "academic journal" on nature.com
The article is behind a paywall.

That is not an answer that backs up your claim.
Usually when someone forms a question such as yours they do some research to find the answer.
You’re either lazy or dumb.

Did you know.....that lightning node clients require a full bitcoin node to be able to function?
Lightning nodes are just as trustworthy as bitcoin full nodes.
Edit: lightning does work...just sayin

Here’s the answer to your questions [served up on a silver fuckin platter]( 
You’re always going to get zero upvotes when people don’t like your content. That’s how Reddit works.
And, did you even read the paper that you posted?
Directly from it’s text:
“Analysts at Credit Suisse examined Bitcoin’s potential to consume all the world’s energy and concluded for that to happen the price of a coin would have to rise to $1.1 million. Credit Suisse is not worried because they think coin miners will improve efficiency to reduce their demand for power. Since 2010, power demand by the internet’s server farms has stayed level for this reason, despite exponential growth in consumer demand. (Helman 2018)”
It’s like you’re not reading anything at all. Not surprising, really.

You’re clearly new to this. It’s okay.
Just remember don’t buy bitcoin, you know it’s going to crash again.
