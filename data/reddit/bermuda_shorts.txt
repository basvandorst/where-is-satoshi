We're almost on the same page. You're correct in that just running a node results in no direct compensation to the host. However, running a node does enable you to also run a P2Pool node. P2pool is a decentralized mining pool. You don't need to be a miner (although you can), and you can charge a fee for hosting the P2Pool node. 
Given all the current concerns around centralization, hosting a  bitcoin node a P2Pool node are (IMHO) two of the best things you can do to support Bitcoin. Check out P2Pool.org for more details. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:01:44
Look into running your own node and then joining P2Pool. It's much more cost effective then joining a 3rd party pool, and you're supporting the bitcoin network. 0% fee, but you do have to deal with variance.

People shouldn't confuse Bitcoin with credit. Credit runs the current economy - If you have any doubt of that; find a 1st world country with a decreasing national debt, or whose citizens have an average decreasing private debt.  It doesn't exist. 
Bitcoin = digital cash. Bitcoin won't change a thing for people or nations that can't adequately manage credit. It does, however, radically change the "playing field" for those that can.

1. Speculation, large-scale, with an licensed and legitimate institution.
2. Insurance. If you own 1000 BTC, purchasing a long term OTM (Out of The Money) leveraged short (i.e. put) is an inexpensive way to limit your losses to a desired amount, should the price of BTC crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:45:10
There’s speculative risk if Satoshi moves a coin or two, sure. But imagine the upside if he starts contributing to the code again! ��

Put simply - It takes Work. 
Hence ‘Proof Of Work.’ By guaranteeing a fixed amount of work required, any party trying to hack the bitcoin network (‘double spend’) must also Work, the guaranteed same amount. 
The prize for solving these math problems, and expending all that work, is a lot. On average, 12.5 bitcoins every 10 min.  This large economic incentive is currently generating about 80 000 000 000 000 000 000 complex math problem solutions, per second.

Linking from a checking or savings account on Coinbase is super simple. Just link the account on Coinbase by providing the right details (acct. number, routing number, etc).  Be aware transactions this way are not instant, and take 3 to 5 business days.  The first time you set this up, the will send a test transaction (for a couple pennies) and you will have to verify it. That also takes 3-5 business days. 
This how I purchase most of my bitcoins. It's slower than using a debit or credit card, but it's less hassle In the long run if you will regularly buying coins. I.E. (I know it's possible), but when's the last time your savings account got hacked?

If miners would embrace P2Pool, this problem would solve itself. But P2Pool has yet to overcome its variance in the face of miners who prefer daily payments. 
Satoshi was brilliant in building the miner incentive into his protocol. While it's true that miners respond to economic incentives, it's not always true that miners make the right economic choices.

Thanks Peter, I've always appreciated your contributions to the BTC community. I'd double check this though, regarding P2Pool. While it may be possible to withhold blocks within P2Pool, because it's decentralized there is no incentive to do so.  When every minor is decentralized, but linked via the same pool there's little incentive to withhold from your own team. 
As to why more people don't use it, I call it human nature. Despite its benefits, it's the variance that causes the average minor not to utilize it. Patience has never been one of my stronger qualities either☺️
