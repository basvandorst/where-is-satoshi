Awesome thanks for the help. Do you trade on bit quick?
@_date: 2014-11-22 21:30:42
Yeah I agree since I have connected my phone to my computer VIA USB. Very shocked that it was my devices that got compromised. This was my first time using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:43:30
Appreciate the concern. I just wanted to let Bitcoin users know so they take caution when trading.

Absolutely I had 2 factor enabled. Not only did I have 2 factor but also Login Guard. Im just as confused as you are. The thief was using "Hushmail" which i believe to be a private email to withhold the identity of the user.

I wrote a post about it just recently when it happened. Heres a copy paste
Be EXTREMELY careful when using LocalBitcoin for Bitcoin transactions. I purchased and transferred about $2,000 USD worth of coin from my BlockChain to my LocalBitcoin account. I received an email to my personal Gmail account literally seconds later from this address.
Asking to purchase 10 Coin. I replied stating that I am transferring my coin from BlockChain to LocalBitcoin and if he would like to do a transaction, I only accept Cash Deposits. It takes a few moments for Blockchain to complete the transfer of Coins to your LocalBitcoin Account. Once transfer is complete I should have ended up with about 7.00 Coins total. I saw on my LocalBitcoin account that the funds were being transferred. SECONDS later my account depleted down to 0.000 Coins. My account was hacked, and I was robbed of all coin ($2,000 USD).
I contacted LocalBitcoin support and they were useless. Only thing they helped me with was the IP address from where my account was logged into, and the time frame from which all my Coins were stolen. This is what LocalBitcoin support replied to my concern for my stolen Coins....
By peter.localbitcoins Nov. 20, 2014, 5:06 p.m. - 6 hours ago Hi,
If you are certain that there was an unauthorized transaction from your account, it is possible that someone has obtained your login credentials either through phishing site, social engineering or a virus from your computer.
In order to prevent this kind of incident in future, please change your password and enable two factor authentication and/or login guard from your security settings ( ).
Unfortunately, there's no way to reverse bitcoin transactions.
Here are latest logins to your account for you to investigate whether these logins were made yourself or not. Timezone of these logins are UTC.

Best regards, LocalBitcoins
The computer i use is strictly for business and of course I had 2 factor enabled as well as login guard. I hope that this information can help other Bitcoin users in the future to prevent anybody from the situation that happened to me. BEWARE of LocalBitcoin. If anyone has any information to help track down this pathetic thief please advise.

The email from maicobrigs had no link attached. All it stated was...
hello can we deal ? i need to buy like 10 btc over the localbitcoins site! let me know if we can have a deal ! best regards
Sent using Hushmail
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:55:53
Didn't think about contacting Hushmail. I will keep you all updated on their response. 
I didn't purchase BTC on blockchain. I just moved the coins from blockchain to LB
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:59:12
I have no idea either. Im as baffled as you are.

@_date: 2014-11-22 21:25:30
I agree with that. I think the thief did have access to my iPhone somehow. No I was not using Tor, and no my Gmail for LocalBitcoin is different from the one I was contacted with.
@_date: 2014-11-22 20:43:04
I honestly have no idea how my information was stolen. I use 2 Factor Authy from my IPhone. No clue why maicobrigs contacted me right then. I also don't know how he obtained my personal Gmail account. That was the form of communication he had with me. I had a AD for Vanilla but had not posted one for Cash Deposit until seconds before my coin was stolen.

no link in email
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:49:30
I did have 2fa enabled on my account but not for my email. I didn't even know that was an option.
@_date: 2014-11-23 01:51:50
Authorities were contacted as soon as the incident happened.
