People think bitcoin supporters are blind fools because shit like this get's to be the top post by a very large margin. Maybe they are onto something.
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:48:02
Zoom out!
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:29:45


It happens when it goes up, when it goes down and when it goes nowhere. If you want to keep coming to this sub just embrace the memes and let the fools have their their upvotes because many of them won't have much else eventually.

It is useful if you want to ignore the fall from 20k to 6k
@_date: 2018-10-31 06:47:11
One day until "zoom out a year" no longer works.
@_date: 2018-10-20 12:07:19


Those things happen in part because it is a free space.
@_date: 2018-06-29 06:38:44
Can it be stable?
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:21:38
It's cringy everywhere, people just get used to it.
@_date: 2018-06-10 11:23:35
Yes, but that is way too long to make a meme about it.
@_date: 2018-06-02 09:22:00
And also use your computer to mine more.

I learned of bitcoin because of the mining craze that drove pc components' prices up. 
I kept watching as some people got "rich" and a lot of internet idiots thought they were also getting rich while being heroes of a revolution.  
Lately I'm here because it is fascinating, some people are coping with huge loses by making memes, other are still in the hardest of denials and a bunch just are hoping this is another "get rich quick" paid by the other guys.  
It would make and interesting sitcom.
@_date: 2018-11-02 12:47:36
...then its value as speculative asset will drop.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:29:02
Throw a ball blindfolded a few thousand times and spin around a variable amount after each throw. Let me know the behavior you see after.

Different uses require different sources of oil.

This sub during all this year.

PM your personal data and proof to the mods so if it happens you can't just chicken out by deleting your reddit account.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:01:14
I'm just surprised this isn't already the top post.
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:21:09
That is why it the top post right now.
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:03:17
Guaido is also an elected leader of Venezuela.
@_date: 2019-01-26 17:31:18
Yes they do, airplane fuel, land vehicles fuel, lubricants, plastics, construction materials, high purity mixtures for chemical processes... 
They are all very important uses, cut one out and you have entire industry sectors shut down. The profit margins are so thin in some cases that in some cases it is more efficient to export the raw oil and import the processed product because of different infrastructure and different oil sources in different countries.
EDIT: Lightly related trivia. Plastic is usually more expensive by itself than metal, but the manufacturing methods for mass production are so cheap that makes it seem like plastic is just disposable trash.

The gold belongs to Venezuela, not to Maduro.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:17:14
And usually doesn't know shit.
@_date: 2018-11-11 11:05:25
That is why it gets reposted and upvoted constantly.
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:57:35
Probably on the same 1.9k or any other number is based on.
@_date: 2018-07-14 15:28:37
Even for this sub standards this one is bad.
EDIT: And... top post with almost 6000 upvotes!!!
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:45:51
How long until this gets inverted and reposted?
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:09:21
Welcome to the front page.
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:15:54


The shitpost is the information.
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:35:28
Just like most of the frontpage post in this sub.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:59:53
You can do both if you want.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:51:42


That current cars have more value than old cars and that reflects on how much they cost.  
If you could buy a new car that had the features of a 1981 car (no AC, no remote, worse performance, terrible emissions, no seatbelts, no airbags, no energy absorbing chasis, heavy as fuck etc ) it would be very cheap.
Even today low quality imported cars are a problem because they look modern on the outside but inside they are just a frame with and engine and seats.
In the other hypothetical case if in 1981 there was a car with the features of current cars it would be more expensive than regular 1981 cars.
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:36:30
Then the right choice is to sell now and buy before the price starts going up again.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:06:03
This is a great way for the poor to stay poor and the rich to stay rich
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:14:57


you mean like the reposted memes that consistently get the frontpage on this sub?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:03:27
Same guy
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:37:53
A tall glass of denial?

The future might be bright but the present has bills to pay.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:27:43
I come to this sub every now and then, so it is very possible.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:21:08
What about the value in security, mileage, comfort, ease of use, emisions etc?
If we value them just as forms of independent transportation we could also said that a truck, a bicycle and a pair of shoes are equally valuable.

Some studies have been made suggesting that some herpes have been providing protection from bacterial infections in animals for millions of years.
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:38:24
People cutting loses, people with bills to pay, people who take risk into consideration, people who want to buy when the price is lower, people who just want out...
@_date: 2018-12-28 07:46:31
What is more valuable, a 1981 car or a 2018 car?
@_date: 2018-12-01 16:49:12
Because it is an speculative asset many see as a get-rich-quick scheme?
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:15:48
Again
