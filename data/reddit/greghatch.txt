It does not take that long to "clear."
I mean, it does take that long to clear, obviously, it's just being cleared at an artificially slow speed on purpose.

What the hell does "money you can afford to lose" mean? 
Is that ever true? 
I'm pretty sure I understand what you mean, and semantics aside, it's just a little unreasonable to call storing money on exchanges "reckless investing" if you can't afford to lose that money. 
It's reckless either way (or not reckless either way), "affording it" really can't be a significant contribution when considering the riskiness of investing in a particular exchange, on the macro scale (where decisions happen).
I'm not eschewing personal responsibility, but I don't get the old "should've played around it!" reaction to "unexpected" bankruptcy of an exchange engaging in shady behavior. "Shouldn't have invested if you can't afford it" isn't really a useful explanation for anything other than diminishing an emotional reaction.
The risk of losing money shouldn't make any bad result "part of the game," heated emotions are pretty justified here, and however legal, right, or normal this is in the financial sector, it's worth discussing with a little passion and perhaps anger.
Emotions can be a costly luxury, though.

Yeah, and it could be faster, if it wasn't more profitable to be slow.

News is not required to be surprising, it need only be current and noteworthy.

I don't think journalistic integrity is the only criteria for market share and customer retention.
Hell, it's probably not important at all, for print media.

Nothing is certain, but I would say this theory is unlikely. He would have needed to do all of this planning ahead of time, and with the idea that this particular obfuscation of language dialect would be somehow relevant and believed.
Not impossible, just very unlikely. And weird.
