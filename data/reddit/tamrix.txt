That's the comment your replying to.

Why do bitcoin enthusiasts blame the company and not the hackers? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:38:45
Well then why didn't you say that the first time instead of going on about security and who's responsibility it is?
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:39:23
To me it's like someone stole a bunch of shoes from a shoe warehouse and started selling shoes. Everyones like, "looks on the bright side shoes are so cheap now!" and they run off and start buying the stolen shoes. 
Then to all the people/stores those shoes where going to everyones like, "well you shouldn't have stored all your shoes in the warehouse. It's the warehouses fault for not securing the shoes." 
Meanwhile people like me are asking why on Earth you're supporting shoe theft and where's the accountability. Seems to be like no one cares about catching the hackers they just want their cheap shoes to go.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:18:12
Of course it's somewhat their responsibility but now since hackers own a good chunk of bitcoins, when you buy/sell bitcoins your funding the market in which they stole from and in essences funding them. 
You simply can't refund the stolen money so the only way you can continue to say bitcoin is a success is to blame the exchange for their security not the hackers. 
I think cryptocurrencies are a great idea but I wont be buying bitcoins because I don't want to fund these criminals and fuck the people over that lost money. 
But you instead say it's entirely the exchanges fault, which makes it acceptable for you to continue to purchase bitcoins and funding criminals. 
At the end of the day you're no more moral than the banks you're trying to rid the world of. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:36:31
Why do people still think bitcoin is a viable alternative to the dollar? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:58:34
Just because they're security got compromised doesn't mean that they didn't try to keep it secure. 
More importantly, why don't you feel sorry for the people who lost their money? 
@_date: 2016-04-15 05:52:31
Shouldn't the government represent the people?
Do you believe it does?
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:14:34
Why can't we just increase the blockchain temporarily?
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:09:54
I mean any crypto currency can do almost anything if you program it.
Where's the lighting network now? Oh right, it's still in testing. So technically OPs post is a lie. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:13:15
So when's this lighting network going to come because I'm pretty sick of waiting. The developers should hurry the fuck up or Bcash may as well be the next bitcoin at this rate.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:28:24
Maybe if they increase the block chain size. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:32:17
I meant the block size in the block chain.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:17:30
Well you can continue to lose companies supporting bitcoin for transactions until such time as this magical lighting network gets released and it's all because you don't want to increase the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:26:06
Whoa, cool down. All I'm saying is I think this lighting network is taking too long and it's starting to hurt bitcoin adoption. Don't act hastily.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:07:21
Then ditch crypto all together?
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:08:33
The Lightening Network. A network which transfers IOUs from node to node beacuse transfering bitcoint is too expensive / time consuming due to not raising the block chain size because everybody is against it for no reason.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:49:45
You have such an amazing observation. This is the first time I've ever heard someone say this.
@_date: 2018-01-24 02:01:33
Who said I'm rage quitting? The company Strip is. Go tell them that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:48:06
Americans hate themselves and each other. No crypto currency is going to solve that. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:52:04
What the fuck is a bitcoin federation?
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:45:46
A fork. Whether people will want the fork or not. I'm sure someone will do it. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 06:04:26
Won't be any worse than the lighting network lol 
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:51:26
When you realise it's propaganda so the value stays high for the whales.

This is so obvious anyone who supported or up voted the apple story deserves nothing but death.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:45:46
And just pay a bunch of transaction fees for little benefit. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:46:18
Rather buy it in dogecoins 
@_date: 2014-09-12 12:21:17
No one had even confirmed it was icloud.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:34:24
They should release a new updated client deleting those 800k bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 06:51:56
How will I be rich if other people don't adapt to using bitcoin driving the price up. 
I want to be rich. 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:42:58
Why don't we do it with dogecoin too? 
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:04:58
Lol poor bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:12:05
Yeah but it's a party. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:51:35
Look we all know the idea of distributed cryto-currencys was founded with bitcoin but that doesn't mean it's the best. 
Community is what makes a currency. It's only going to be traded if we as a community support it, trade it and help it grow.
The only people who trade bitcoin are individuals that want the make money. Because of the greed bitcoin has lost it potential as a friendly community for new comers and as a result it will see a decline.
Your comment is bang on what this community stands for. 


This kind of ego you have thinking you're so high and mighty is what makes this community suck. All the "too bad for you, should have invested in Mt Gox", "buy bitcoins now, price will surely go up". This shit, isn't about crypto currencies it's about people investing to make money. 
Making money is now the goal of bitcoin. No one gives a fuck about it being a new generation of currency. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:36:32
It's not. Invest in dogecoin. They have a NASCAR!
Where the fuck is bitcoins nascar? Oh right, they don't have one. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:14:54
Do you see bitcoin as currency or just as an investment? 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:04:48
What about next coin? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:57:39
To be fair if I was Mt Gox I would have done this. Hate on it all you want it's fair game. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:25:42
Don't forget runing someone's reputation online without evidence is a superior solution because bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:16:24
I think if bit coin is really going to survive it should be immune to greed.  If someone can destroy but coin by being greedy then it wasn't all that great to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:32:05
I love it how you say invested. 
You don't give a shit about bitcoin as a viable alternative to the dollar. You just want to make money. 
Bitcoin is for investors. It's not a tool to buy your groceries or pay your rent with. This is why bitcoin will die. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 05:33:02
Omg if you guys haven't caught on now you never will.
They release news that China will not support bitcoin, then bitcoin price goes down, they buy up and release news China will support bitcoin after all, price goes up and they sell! 
Simple economics son.
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:54:50
Don't forget bitcoin would be telling dogecoin how it was first and thus better. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:10:54
So much fun! Wooroloo 
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:44:33
I bet both of those times someone here said it was the best Opportunity to buy. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 00:39:19
Remember when that guy ate his hat. We should raise it to two hats this time. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 07:26:05
You should read more into dogecoin because it's closer to litecoin than bitcoin. But mostly we all know the dogecoin community is a lot bettet
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:02:17
No one in bitcoin actually care about the crypto currency anymore, everyone here just wants to be rich. To many greedy individuals who burry any bad news about bitcoin to make a profit. Just look at how many people think deflation is good for the economy! 
@_date: 2014-08-16 20:42:32
Divide and conquer. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:21:29
You should be buying gold then. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:38:50
Come on guys! Buy more bitcoins!! I want to be rich!
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:45:26
That's a pretty bold statement. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 09:44:53
No ones going to join your fork if you change it modify the crypto algorithm. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 21:13:15
Can you cite me a comparison of transaction costs. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:20:21
Well if ssl or Linux was at fault I'm sure they could blame them. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:06:48
I hate to be that guy but I need need sources before you start putting blame on people. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:04:46
Dogecoin is more fun. Just saying. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:54:38
Wow this is DISGUSTING. America should do something.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:48:52


wtf the fuck are you talking about? This is the worst analogy ever.
@_date: 2014-02-21 05:25:15
Dogecoin doesn't require a years worth of research. Just saying. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 03:51:23
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:46:33
Anyone who uses BTC is destroying bitcoin and my investment. Bitcoin should easily reach $2000 by mid year and I can cash out and be a millionaire! 
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:57:30
No matter what news it is. It's always buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 06:14:22
Well who had the most to lose?
@_date: 2014-04-30 10:35:37
Mit world number one number one in the world's number one. Woohoo USA! USA! USA! 
R/merica represent. \m/
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:39:54
Do people still use bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:11:08
I hate how Bitcoin is all about an investment to make money rather than a usable currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:46:42
It's ironically not. A volatile currency is not as usable as a stable one. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:09:33
Someone didn't read the blog post. There's been many attempts to fork but they keep getting DDOS by the top miners. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 01:29:33
Why is a deflating currency a good one? If deflation is so awesome, why don't we encourage massive deflation in the USD?
@_date: 2016-01-24 03:18:36


This is all very simple economics but I'm sure your greed for bitcoin growing in value so you can be rich is losing your common sense.
This is a beginners economics website. It should help you pass the 4th grade.
 
* Discourages consumer spending
* Increase real value of debt. 
* Increased real interest rates.
* Real wage unemployment.
* More difficult for relative prices and wages to adjust. 
* Deflation can become entrenched and difficult to end.
By all means put all your money into bitcoin but stop thinking you're going to be rich because you're not.
@_date: 2016-03-01 11:39:31
So transactions are down but I suppose they still use it
@_date: 2016-01-24 01:55:45
The rising value of a bitcoin coin is deflation. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:16:22
Let's make some MONEIESSS!! 
we're all going to be SUPER RICH!
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:39:12
bitcoins supply is slows down and eventually runs out. Of course that's a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2016-01-24 02:47:45


This limits trading. Why would I spend bitcoin and actually use it if it can continue to gain wealth by doing nothing but sit there?


This is out of context if you actually want it to be a replacement to the USD than all the above does apply.
Why would ANYBODY use a currency whereby NOT using it creates value?

Tell me again how this isn't deflation MR Economics PRO KeavesSharpi
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:21:33
Yeah long live bitcoin. It's da best!
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:05:31
Who cares if he deserves respect. I wanna make some moneyyyyyyy yeah! Bitcoin rules!
@_date: 2014-01-09 10:59:18
You're not allowed to say anything bad about bitcoin ^tm
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:15:49
I'm not saying decentralized crypto currencies are bad, just bitcoin. 
Why would anyone want to use a currency that spikes and loses so much value in hours. There simply must be a better implementation 
Reducing consumer spending doesn't mean everyone retires faster. You seen to be focused on only yourself gaining money from bitcoin. You're not alone thinking like this either. Bitcoin has become a method to fester people's greed. You may as well just invest your money in the stock market. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 09:03:45
I'm just adding to the conversation.  I'm not OP
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:38:15
It's about access to education. If it's too expensive for half hour population, then your limiting social mobility.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:48:47
That guy ate his hat when he said he would. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 11:59:53
Fine by me if you want to increase purchasing power relative to adding more productivity.
If you're going to increase the value by short supplying people, then you're going to have another bubble and no one would want to hold their savings in such a volatile currency.
@_date: 2015-08-18 09:31:34
Why do people want the price to go up anyways. If bitcoin is a viable alternate currency, it's better if the price remains the same.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:15:08

Tell me again how lighting network is going to be mankind's best invention and solve ever problem ever without being released?

@_date: 2018-03-18 07:27:26
But if they make it seem like it's positive, people reading will think it's is in fact positive and continue to invest, driving the market up.
I wouldn't be surprised if some of these users and votes are from paid shills. This is especially true for alt coins and the lighting network. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:20:11
I agree but I don't think that cryptocurrencys have to be based off greed. It's the future just not with so much deflation.
@_date: 2015-04-17 06:31:04
I agree. I would rather see news articles on bitcoin than what the hourly price update is and how everyone going to be rich.
The currency of the future to me would have less greed.

Whatever option makes the most money for my investment is the one I want. Maor money!! 
@_date: 2015-02-18 01:25:26
There's so many problems with bitcoin if it was to ever scale the globe. Slow transactions. No reversable transaction. 1mb block size issue hasn't been solved. Unstable. Deflationary. Large download to join the network. Limited number of coins. Sha2 sucks. And there's plenty more. But most importantly everyone views it as an investment, not an everyday use currency's. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:19:46

You know b-bank is the best name here. Don't you lie to the Internet!
@_date: 2013-05-09 11:32:17
You should call it b-bank like bitcoin bank and then you can sing this tune: 'b-boys fly girls throw your hands in the air _clap clap clap_ b-bank like you just don't care'. Then your slogan is like 'just don't care - you can transfer your money anywhere. ' then like break dance moves and people not carrying about how they across their money because breakdancing is way cooler. So your cool too. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:21
Nice observation. We could use a guy like you on our bit force. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:42
A few currencies are getting revalued on April 15th. People are just moving money everywhere to preserve their value. Bitcoin seams to be on the market now. I'm predicting it could slump after april 15th. However who knows.

It's only a taxable if you trade your bitcoins for your local currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:54:32
Alright despite the website being completely inaccessible the trading API is still working. Some people as you say are trading thousands of small transactions through their API. They could easily find and stop these users to restore access for everyone else. 
Scares are mtgox has been hacked by annoymous  How do you hack a website that's down is beyond me and isn't this just the perfect timing?
Maybe someone is trying to scare the market?
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:06:21
lol you're so cool bro
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:55:48
You have to wait for someone to actually buy the coins. This could take mind to days depending on your price and quantity. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:16:54
How do you buy stuff online when the value if bitcoin changes by almost 50% in only a few hours?
