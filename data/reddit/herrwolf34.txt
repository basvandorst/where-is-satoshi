Bcash is a scam by the simple principle that if Bitcoin is worth anything at all it can never be changed by a minority group. If that ever happens it will happen again and again and in the end by the banks and the state and then we just have fiat money.

This 1% is just pathetic as a advice. Either you are so rich you have millions of dollars then having just 1% is not gonna protect your wealth from hyperinflation. If you are poor (less than $100k) 1% is nothing and don't matter. They say 1% just so nobody will laugh at them if it fails.

who cares lol. If some people take seriously what some dude wrote in his diary several thousand years ago and let that hinder them then it's their loss.

I call bullshit on that one. A simple keylogger can't read what icon i click on. If a compromised computer means you are fucked then crypto is uber fucked because the majority of the worlds computers are infected already and if crypto ever got mainstream all viruses would be designed to steal crypto.

I have been trying to educate people the difference from shitcoins to bitcoin. Still they will always buy small caps shitcoins that pumps. Well if i get hex for free why not benefit from their incurable stupidity?

well trezor ask you for a specific seed word in a random order and only the device knows the order not your computer so a keylogger can't steal your coins as easy as the electrum wallet will.

To know that your computer is 100% secure is impossible unless you use way more secure OS than windows which most people don't and if thats the case bitcoin is way overpriced because who would bother.  And even then you will still get hacked... even the most "secure" datacenters in the world have been hacked.

If you can make do with only half your salary and use the other half (BTC half) as a savings account i would do it. Odds are in 4 years time you will easily have doubled if not not 10x-100x that salary.
Oh and yes only use hardware wallets.

well i have trezor, is it safe to sign with a trezor from the trezor wallet?
Also care to explain how it is not safe to sign signature with private key? I get conflicting answers.

okay then

To say hardrives are getting cheaper with the same rate as bitcoin blockchain will expand is laughable. Hardrives don't even double in size every four years anymore and the blockchain will grow with a lot more than just double every four years.
