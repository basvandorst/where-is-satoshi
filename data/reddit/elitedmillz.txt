Can someone explain to me why bitcoin hasn't crashed in awhile? I've been using it for years now actually buying stuff with it, gambling etc. and I've found other currencies are faster and cheaper. 
I feel like everybody here is just holding bitcoin with the hopes of getting rich but aren't actually day to day users other than trading. The fees and times of the block confirmations are deal breakers for me. 
I remember back in 2016 summer bitcoin was around 500$ and would jump up and down up to 2k. Bitcoin has been so stable lately and If anything the lack of volatility  would have me concerned.

lol why would anyone want to spend money with an uber based demand system?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:08:41
yeah but in my opinion there should be a price correction. At this point there are better alternatives that are more efficient that bitcoin, if anything that should drive down the price of bitcoin not force it upwards. 
Sometimes it takes me 4 hours to send 10$ of btc with a 5$ fee.  how is something that inefficient worth that 11k and counting? I'd rather just ether or litecoin
