Yeah, you can do that.  They won't get very far, but they're more than welcome to poke around.
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:10:57
We'll be piloting such a service next month, but it'll be a little different from what's on the market today -- in a good way. :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:07:23
Why the hate?  You don't have to value compliance to value one of the easiest ways to buy bitcoin.  Trucoin is not doing anything to financially support the SEC -- Trucoin is simply following the law so that it can continue to exist.
To the contrary, Trucoin was one of the first companies to directly finance the development of the bitcoin protocol.  That doesn't sound like supporting the status quo to me.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:09:57
Which bank are you with that specifically precludes you from buying bitcoin in their terms?
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:32:35
Would you PM me about this, please?
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:00:02
The website may offer some clarity: 
Trucoin sells bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:14:38
No problem!  Thanks for inviting us to answers questions for our fellow redditors.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:25:05
Yes, all accounts have 2FA built in.  Someone would have to take over your social account *and* get your Trucoin password.  However, we're adding 3FA very soon.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:57:23
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:23:36
We're focused on one thing right now -- making bitcoin accessible and easy to purchase.  Stay tuned, though, and we're actively working on next steps.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:24:06
Honestly, I always thought of New Hampshire as being one of the most free states, too.  They sure do have a lot of positive things going for them (ie. no sales tax, no personal income tax, no eminent domain, no capital gains tax).  However, sadly, they also regulate remittance through the Money Transmission Act.  We're actively working to add coverage, though, and I look forward to serving New Hampshire in the future.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:41:55
Yes.  Canada will be one of the first non-US countries that we expand to. :)
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:18:58
At this point, I feel like I could write a book on credit card fraud.  It would not be easy to sum it all up in a few sentences, but I will try:
I would put our fraud mitigation methods into two categories; interactive and non-interactive.  Interactive steps, like social login, KBA, and split charge verification are all things that you participate in.  Non-interactive steps include things looking at cross-merchant fraud lists, comparing IP location to the customer-supplied location, comparing the address to the address on file at the issuing banks, and so on.  All of these methods work together to allow us to weed out fraudsters and allow legitimate users to sail right through and instantly purchase bitcoin.

Our office in Aventura, Florida.  South Carolina is one of the states that we serve through our website.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:12:43
We don't have a native android app, but I think you will find that our site is very responsive and works well on mobile.
My hope is that NC will be in the next two rounds.

It's my pleasure!

Would you please send me a message with your email address so that I can see what happened?
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:35:15
It's true.  This is the only question I'm not really willing to answer in public.  Some of the techniques that we use are ones that we spent a great deal of time and money developing in-house.
I can tell you, though, that for most people it's a snap to use.  I'm sorry that I couldn't be more specific.
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:28:26
Hold on, there.  Trucoin has been around since 2011, long before the site you are referring to.  We've been totally open about who we are and what we're about.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:23:52
That's not correct.  Both of those companies mark up the bitcoin price and pass through processing costs.  You're not going to be able to buy bitcoin instantly from either of them for 1%.  There is no way around processing costs, and so we do the same, and it disclose everything clearly before an order is even placed.
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:39:09
We /are/ preventing fraud, and we /are not/ IMHO anywhere near as cumbersome or as aggravating as our competition.
Give it a try and see for yourself.
There are ways of preventing "friendly fraud" chargebacks, as well.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:23:47
Thank you, -- I see it now :)
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:33:09
We will be adding support for more countries in the very near future.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:06:23
It should be in our next batch of states, but I can't promise that.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:59:23
It follows market rates.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:32:25
Unfortunately, both you and your address must be within our service area.  I hope that you'll allow us to serve you when you are home, however.  We are actively working to offer service in additional states, in the meantime.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:38:30
What state are you in?
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:21:48
Yes.  You can purchase instantly using your debit or credit card.  We make a very small percentage on the markup, and the only fees that we charge are passed through from our acquiring bank and disclosed up front.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:19:21
At some point, yes, although it won't be in the next round.

We source bitcoin from other bitcoin exchanges, at this time.  Several security measures are in place to protect coins that are temporarily held with us, including multi-signature wallets and cold storage.
Trucoin USA is a partnership of regulated money transmitters and is subject to regular audits by more than one state.  We're always looking at ways of being more transparent, and in the future that may include a public audit page.
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:28:10
Colorado is home to the oldest money transmitter on the block.  The process is a incredibly complex, and the requirements are some of the most expensive in the country to comply with.
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:18:11
Our system takes several dozen factors into consideration upon enrolling a new customer, but for 95% of the population it takes less than two minutes. From then on, you can buy any time you want, in just seconds.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:28:40
While we don't have native apps, our site is extremely mobile friendly.  You should have no trouble conducting transactions on the go.
If you do have an issue, though, please let me know.

To be honest, I'm afraid that I can't offer a hard date for Wisconsin.  Your local regulators are the ones who get to decide who is allowed to operate in your state.  We are, however, actively working on serving Wisconsin.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:48:09
It's my pleasure.
We're only unknown right now because we've been extremely careful to keep quiet until this week, but that will change shortly.
If you're in one of our supported states, I'd love for you to check us out:
Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:22:42
Would you message me so that I can check into this for you, please?
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:39:59
This is correct.  In many cases it's actually even longer -- seven months for some credit cards.  Debit cards tend to be closer to one or two months.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:17:53
Oh wow.  Huge copy/paste fail on my part.  The original post has been corrected.  Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:23:19
Hang on, now.  I'm refreshing the thread looking for new questions, but I don't always spot them right away.
I believe we're running MCC code 8999, (Misc. Services) at the insistence of our processor.
MCC codes that are treated by issuing banks as a Cash Advance are harder to charge back for customers.  While that would be nice for us, we are looking for long-term relationships with our customers and do not wish to subject them to hidden fees.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:50:02
That's a fantastic question!  I'm not going to comment on the compliance status of any particular entity, other than our own.  **However**, you can find an exhaustive list of every non-bank company on the planet that has the legal authority to sell bitcoin in the state of New York, at this address:
@_date: 2014-07-20 06:46:58
It would turn into a debt that would be collected in other ways.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:17:12
We don't really charge any fees, other than what our acquiring bank charges us.  We intend to make money by slightly marking up the bitcoin price.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:33:20
Yes, you can.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:29:31
Our current chargeback rate is less than half a percent.
@_date: 2014-11-04 02:04:22
Both.  The address of the customer and the physical location of the customer must be inside our footprint in order for us to be able to serve them.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:15:04
It is our intention to serve you again as quickly as possible.  We anticipate it taking a few weeks, but we are working hard to make it happen sooner.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:16:23
Well, officially it's another two months away, but that's not for legal reasons.  If you add yourself to the waiting list and send me a message with your email address, I will give you access to check it out today.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:31:18
Thanks, btrueblood.  It's good to hear from you, and I appreciate the kind words.
@_date: 2014-07-16 14:37:03
We spent a great deal of time developing the system we have, and I'd like to know who I'm speaking with before I share any details.  I'm sorry that I can't discuss it in front of everyone.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:21:17
I'm afraid that I posted Illinois in error.  Illinois is not in this round, but we are actively working to add coverage in Illinois.
And yes, some states are much more difficult than others.  The easiest, by far, is South Carolina where there is no remittance legislation at all.  The hardest states are California, Colorado, and New York, IMHO.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:11:27
That's a fine question!
You'll find that Trucoin allows you to buy more bitcoin instantly than anywhere else.  So, rather than being limited to $250 or $500 per week, you're able to buy $500 or more every single day.
Another major advantage is that there are no hidden fees, including Cash Advance fees.
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:01:52
If it turns out that I'm able to attend, then I will absolutely take you up on that.

Hi, r/bitcoin!
I'm Chris Brunner from Trucoin, and I'm here to answer any questions that you may have.  Or, if you're in one of our beta states, you're more than welcome to give us a look in person.  
Those states are: Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:35:55
I've personally run test transactions using my Chase card without issue.  We have several customers who use Chase, and I am not aware of any problems that they have had, either.
That's not to say that Chase is a fan of bitcoin.  I will have our counsel check into Chase's cardholder terms and see if there is anything that our customers could be running afoul of, but I would be shocked if they explicitly forbid bitcoin-related transactions in their terms.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:57:31
I can't, no, but in same cases your issuing bank can.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:38:22
I can't yet, but since we're going live in those 25 states in less than 60 days, you won't have to wait too long.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:15:44
Yes!  You shouldn't have an issue using a prepaid card, so long as you don't provide bogus data in the sign up process.
@_date: 2014-06-05 16:51:44
This article is totally incorrect.  As that law is written, the /mining/ of Bitcoin is illegal in California, not its possession or use.
"No corporation, flexible purpose corporation, association or individual shall issue or put in circulation, as money, anything but the lawful money of the United States."
Spreading falsehoods like this is a huge disservice to the crypto-currency community.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:08:55
Would you please send me a message with your email address so that I can check on this?
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:56:25
We're actually live in eight states, and we'll be adding twenty-five more states very shortly.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:31:04
We only offer service where it is legal for us to do so.  We are, however, working on obtaining the legal authority to serve customers in New York, and we look forward to serving you in the future.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:34:26
I can assure you that it's absolutely not the case.  We've never obtained or used emails that came from our competitors.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:35:13
We currently serve Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas.  We will be adding several states shortly and expect to have full US coverage by early next year, if not sooner.
If you reside in one of these states, please feel free to message me for an invite.
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:01:06
We retain some data for seven years, as mandated by certain FATF member countries.
As a US-based Money Services Business, Trucoin USA is subject to the same reporting requirements as all other financial institutions.  These are mostly related to activity that is likely criminal in nature (ie. SAR reports) and does not affect typical customers.
Regarding gag orders, I think you're referring specifically to National Security Letters, and I can safely state that we have not received one.  I will no longer be able to speak to that, if that were to ever change.
The only time we share data with other companies is when we're checking for fraud.  For example, as part of our fraud mitigation program, we check cross-merchant blacklists to ensure that the card being used is not an unreported stolen card.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:37:25
Very soon.  Less than 60 days.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:41:29
It's not magic, but it is pretty complicated and works extremely well.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:45:03
We charge a 5% fee, most of which goes to the card networks in the form of interchange.
If you're in one of the following states, come see for yourself!
Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:38:40
Yes, exactly.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:55:08
Currently only debit card and credit card are accepted.  We found that this is the fastest way for most people to pay.  We will be adding additional payment methods in the future, however.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:15:32
That's an excellent question.  Our system takes several dozen factors into consideration upon enrolling a new customer, but for 95% of the population it takes less than two minutes.

@_date: 2014-11-03 18:14:39
That's an interesting question, considering what subreddit we're in.  I'll let the community handle this one.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:30:51
Yes, soon.
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:07:27
No doubt!  We absolutely never share your financial information -- or even the fact that you're using Trucoin -- with others.  Ever.
If you'd like, you can tell your friends about Trucoin, but that's the only way they're going to find out.
@_date: 2014-11-03 22:28:13
There's not a feature that automatically dings your card, no, but you're welcome to buy as often as you'd like.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:50:16
Again, we prevent fraud by making sure that the user on our site is the actual cardholder.  This can be done in a number of ways, and the efficacy of our particular methods is part of our competitive advantage.
The charges do not count has cash advances.
We have explored, and even implemented VBV on a test basis, but there are several issues: 1) Not all acquiring banks support it, meaning that not all of the processors that we deal with are able to accommodate VBV.  2) Not all issuing banks support it, meaning that even if we have it enabled, it won't help us in many cases.  3) The customer experience is rather poor.  We don't like bouncing customers off site, and then back to us, every time a transaction needs to be completed.  Upon VBV set up, many banks ask for social security number, and other items that we don't believe the customer should have to give out.
With all of that said, VBV is not off the table, but we will likely not enable it for domestic transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:17:13
Unfortunately, lack of enforcement does not make it legal.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:28:10
Directly from us, yes.  No, our price has no connection to coinbase.

It's my pleasure!
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:06:28
You're right that a lot of bitcoin users don't like social login.  Social graph analysis is part of our fraud mitigation system, and we're legally obligated to know who our customers are.  The easiest way for most people to start the KYC process is to simply log in with a social account.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:14:22
We don't have an API for that purpose, but we'd love to hear from developers who would like to work on related projects.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:38:15
Yes, absolutely.  Support for Italy will follow Canada and the UK!
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:24:05
Woah, what?!?  Please contact me directly so that I can hear your story.  We have absolutely nothing to hide, and Eric and I have been very open about who we are from the beginning of Trucoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 03:57:35
So true. I've spoken with so many bankers who just aren't sure how to properly structure the economics of the deal. I know it sounds crazy, but it's probably the biggest barrier, behind fear of bank examiners.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:27:11
This is a huge challenge for any online merchant, but it's especially difficult when you are making instant, digital deliveries.  Our approach to this is to properly identify the cardholder.  The specific type of fraud that you are describing is known as "friendly fraud", which isn't very friendly at all.  We've actually seen less of this than we expected, and I believe it's due to the fact that we have verified identities prior to allowing the first transactions to occur.  So, I think that people know that if they were to try to defraud us, there might be more consequences than if they were anonymously trying to rip a merchant off.  Indeed, in the event of a fraudulent chargeback, we do have recourse.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:20:10
Thanks.  We look forward to serving Canada in the near future.  I do not expect that it will be more than a few months from now.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:41:19
Hi TimeTravelled, Chris Brunner here from Trucoin.  If you need someone to vouch for us, you could check out Gavin Andresen's resume in LinkedIn.  We were his employer before he formed The Bitcoin Foundation, for the purpose of allowing him to continue development on the original bitcoin client.
If you're in one of our Beta states, you can check us out directly on 
If not, your state will likely be added very soon.
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:56:38
Hi consumedbythefire, could you msg me directly so that we can see what's going on with this?
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:36:24
Seconds.  Literally.  Click to place the order and in less than a minute, bitcoin will be delivered to the address that you supply.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:36:34


@_date: 2014-11-04 01:44:38
Sorry -- my error.  The address is jobs
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:27:40
I don't have a hard date for you, but we're working hard to add service in the rest of the country as quickly as possible.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:42:26
It's my pleasure.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:34:45
Thank you for the kind words, Gavin.  We're not giving up until everyone has easy access to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:41:37
I don't mind at all.  If you'll message me your phone number, I'd be happy to discuss this privately with you.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:49:16
We have evaluated several potential partners for execution of this project, including companies that have decades of experience building solutions for traditional ATMs.  We've looked at Diebold-based solutions, Genmega-based solutions, and solutions built on kiosks.  GenesisCoin, however, is better equipped than the others to get this done with us.  We are supplying the ability to process cards for bitcoin as well as the interface to our existing online system for compliance and fulfillment.  The experience that customers get from these units will be totally unlike what is offered today by other solutions.
@_date: 2014-11-08 04:51:33
There are two parts to this.  First, we don't store as much as you might think.  For example, we do store name and address.  However, we do not store answers to your KBA (identity verification) questions, nor do we store social security numbers, or anything along those lines.  Second, we are certified PCI compliant, and we have a full time security engineer whose sole job it is to protect the data that we store.  We take security extremely seriously.
@_date: 2014-07-16 15:30:19
We spent a great deal of time and money on developing a fraud mitigation system that is both easy for the customer and is extremely good at preventing fraud.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:31:39
I'm not sure that we did.  If you PM me, I'll check and find out for you.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:20:53
Hi, reddit!  I'm Chris Brunner, President of Trucoin, and I'm here to answer your questions.
Trucoin was founded three years ago for the purpose of bringing Bitcoin to the masses.  Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for the average Joe to buy Bitcoin.
We are regulated as a Money Transmitter in the states where we operate and we've developed a proprietary fraud mitigation system that allows us to accept Visa and MasterCard payments for instant delivery of Bitcoin.
Please fire away with your questions.
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:28:22
During the week, you should get a response fairly quickly from a staff member.  On the weekend, our staff a little smaller, but we're actively hiring so that we can continue to provide fast responses when customers need assistance.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:19:13
Thanks!  We look forward to serving you.  Our support staff is awesome, but you're always welcome to ping me directly, as well.
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:09:27
Hi, r/bitcoin!  Chris Brunner here, from Trucoin.  I will be awake for a few minutes longer and would be happy to answer any questions you have.
I'd also like to thank you, AstarJoe, for giving us a try and sharing your results.  I'm very happy to hear that you had a great experience.
@_date: 2014-11-03 20:00:02
Yes, we're working hard to serve all 50 states.  I wish we could serve everyone today, but we simply don't have control over the laws in each state.  We do look forward to serving you in the future, though.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:14:02
Absolutely.  We're eager to launch outside of the US, but we're taking it one step at a time.  If you subscribe to our twitter feed, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised in the near future.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:14:54
The key to being able to accept debit and credit card payments for bitcoin is being able to weed out fraudsters.  Every day, hundreds of fraudsters show up on our site in an attempt to rip off cardholders.  We found, however, that most legitimate users already have a social account with real friends attached to it.  While this is not the end-all-be-all to fraud mitigation, it's one extra thing that a fraudster must do, and it's one easy step for legitimate people.

I'll be honest:  California is one of the more difficult states to secure money transmitter licenses in.
We're actively working on solutions, but it may not be in the next round.
Our priority is to be a long-standing resource that the bitcoin community can count on, which for now means serving customers where we are legally authorized to do so.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:02:06
We deliver bitcoin instantly, regardless of the amount -- even for orders over $500.
So, zero banking days, to answer your question.

Hi, r/bitcoin!  Chris Brunner here, from Trucoin.  If you have any questions for us, please fire away.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:28:37
Yes.  The UK and Canada will be two of the first countries to be added.
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:51:57
It won't be long.  We're adding 25 states very shortly.  We just want to make sure we're ready so that we can provide an excellent experience for you.
I look forward to it!
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:26:16
Between one and two percentage points.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:38:52
Yes!  Australia, Canada, and the UK will be added before several other countries.

Deposits into Bitstamp are not free.  The last time I did it, I was charged a hefty international wire fee, which varies depending on which bank you're using.  Charges of $40 or more are not atypical.
Last I checked, neither service accepts cards, unless you count Coinbase which uses your card only in the event that you default on your ACH payment.

Some banks are willing.  Chargeback risk can be mitigated.  You're right that it takes a lot of capital.  It's true that we have to recover interchange costs.  There are no shell companies nor magic account tricks involved.
@_date: 2017-02-05 15:17:13
Did anyone else start buying at less than $1?
@_date: 2014-07-09 21:16:02
That's a great question.  I'm not sure why you would be seeing a link to Google Wallet right now. In the past, we used Google as a placeholder while we were testing the other parts of our app, but today we work with acquiring banks directly to process card payments.  Please message me directly so that we can figure out what's going on, and thank you for pointing this out.
Edit: So what you saw in our HTML was a Javascript include that allows us to use Google Wallet for testing.
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:55:59
I can't promise this, but Arizona will likely be included in our next batch of states.  That would be 60 days or less.
Thank you for the kind words.  We look forward to serving you.

We founded Trucoin in March of 2011.  It took a couple of years to secure the legal ability to sell bitcoin, and we tinkered with a few projects during that time.  However, this was our goal from the start, and we're thrilled to finally be able to offer you this service.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:19:02
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, if you're accustomed to waiting on an ACH or wire.  However, we haven't announced anything yet, so please stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-11-03 21:09:25
Skilled scammers are already aware of these items.  Don't worry, though.  There is a lot more going on behind the scenes.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:26:05
It's not 9% over the bitstamp price.  There is slight markup over bitstamp, and there is a credit card processing fee, which we do not mark up.  Bitstamp does not accept credit cards, nor are any of their payment methods free.  To take the spot price without processing costs at one place and compare it to the entire beginning-to-end costs at another is misleading.

Both billing address of CC, the billing address that you supply, and your physical location when you place the order.

You don't have to trust us.  When you purchase, the bitcoin is delivered instantly to you.

Agreed.  There are *tons* of opportunities, and Iran probably has more potential than most other countries, but Aurlito does not sound like the right person.
By the way, it's "Iranian", not "Iranese".
@_date: 2015-04-01 15:43:02
There are plenty of trustworthy people out there. It's just that politicians and those employed by the state are not those people.
@_date: 2015-04-01 04:22:25
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:17:37
We don't use any bots at all.
@_date: 2013-07-17 06:07:41
I got very excited when I read the headline, but the site is hosted in the US, and the domain is registered to someone with an address in Australia.
Are they really doing business in Iran?  I can't find an address on the website, other than the Austrialian address listed on the domain.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:28:23
With regular limit orders, people are able to jump in front of you, to make sure their order gets executed first, by adjusting their price by .001.  With stealth orders, this isn't possible, because they can't see your order.  That's just one example, of course.
In other cases, some people may feel that their limit orders might influence the price, which could cause the market to move against them.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:20:46
Very unfortunate coincidence.
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:05:20
Hi Chris,
I would be happy to discuss our compliance strategy in a private conversation.  Right now, we are compliant with US law, but we will be transitioning into a model that will require licensing.  Feel free to send me a private message and I'll send you my contact info.
@_date: 2013-07-17 02:31:46
Yes, but that was only for TradeHill.  Now you can place dark pool orders on Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, and BTC-E.
Also, there is no minimum.  Anyone can utilize stealth orders through TruCoin RT, with any order size.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:24:19
Actually legal.  We are not transmitting money, and we've spent nearly as much on legal diligence as we have on the software platform itself, sadly.
You don't have to worry about seizure with us -- we don't handle your money.  We mearly provide a trading platform for you to use with the underlying exchanges.
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:56:44
No. You certainly can't.
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:40:43
We're a trading platform.  So, yes, one interface for trading on the various exchanges.
We do not clear trades or handle your money -- the exchanges do that.  We give you one interface for all those exchanges, and we give you access to reliable, easy-to-use data for you to trade with.
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:49:05
The answer to this question is extremely complicated, but I'd be happy to explain by phone, if you like.  Send me a private message if that's the case.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:28:45
That's coming very soon!
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:47:48
If they run their own order book, rather than piggybacking on other exchanges, then yes.  Actually, someone from Coinbase just requested an invite via reddit.  As soon as they get back to me, and we cover some basic items, we will add them.
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:41:20
I think he means the public market depth data / order book data.
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:09:50
That will be possible in the near future, but for now TruCoin RT enables you to trade on your own accounts.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:53:20
We've decided to allow redditors to jump the queue.
If you would like to see the TruCoin RT trading platform, send me your email address via private message, and I will send you an invite that includes an instant activation link.
Thanks to rdegges for giving us a shout on reddit!
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:42:19
Yes, it would be, but unfortunately this is not possible at this time for legal reasons.  Rather than break the law, we decided to launch a trading platform.
In the future, once we've overcome the regulatory barrier, well, you'll see...
@_date: 2013-07-17 16:13:41
You need to transfer the money through the underlying exchange.  We only provide the trading interface once your money is on deposit.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:39:32
Right now, our service is completely free to use.  We will likely always have a free tier, although it may be ad-supported in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:40:31
I think you'll be pleased to find that this works much better than Bitfinex.  If you send me your email via private message, I'll send you an invite.
If it's not better than Bitfinex, then come back here and tell world.
@_date: 2013-07-16 23:52:33
I wish I could publicly share our plans in this regard, but for now all I can say is that things will get easier in the future.
In the meantime, the exchange accounts are free to create, of course.
@_date: 2013-04-15 20:30:53
It will go back that way, but it may be a few years from now.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:20:26
Yes, we don't like that at all, but right now they don't use seperate API keys/secrets.  We would love to see this change in the future.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:38:55
Yes, we have a relationship with Bitcoin Charts through which our product is branded Bitcoin Charts PRO.
