So that was just a stupid taunt to sell his coins when you are balls deep and cannot or will not buy anyways. That line is getting old. It will not stop the market from moving up or down.

Thought China added 15 TeraHash looking at the title.

LOL what the hell is this crap doing in front page. And I see some other anon wannabes are using this as the perfect ground to bitch about their coins while tripping on Darkcoin at the same time.

So many are now balls deep in BTC and LTC that they have all now forgotten that this is NOT what p2p currency was invented for. This is not decentralization. Now you are buying BTC and LTC from the Central Bank of KNC and Central Bank of GHASH. People are mad sheeple that can be brainwashed easily by saying don't listen to the government, fuck the FED and what not, all the while selling them expensive coins that everyone thinks is going to make them rich.
All of this is starting to stink more than Enron, all the while not even having a CEO or a CFO to blame it on. 
I voted up the OP but watch how the crazy BTC/LTC loonies vote me down for being a threat to their mindlessness as they continue to get brainwashed and brainwash others for their greed to survive.

Ok thanks understood. Apologies.
Starting to dislike Bitcoin a lot as I am starting to understand this centralized scam. I am disliking the Bitcoin propagandists even more who are selling these expensive coins as if they are gold when you can achieve the same with widely available cryptos nowadays, all in the name of fighting the establishment when in fact THIS is the establishment we wanted to fight to begin with. 
Sorry took you for one.

That was my guess too. They are closing your credit card, no where does it say why? how did you purchase bitcoins with cc anyways?
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:31:42
That is not how coinbase works. You are locked in at the time of buying. Are you trying to spread false propaganda here.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:30:43
He just did. Did you buy? How many do you have.

LOL yup. Sheeps are finally waking up. Good to see. BTC will NEVER go to moon. Too many people are now smarter for all this ..
