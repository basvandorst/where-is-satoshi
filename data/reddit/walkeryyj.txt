Make sure you are familiar with FINTAC 
I would highly suggest that you file a report of the transaction once its made. this isn't a hornets nest you want to knock over. 
If you have reason not to, you done already fuckedup by posting this on what appears to be your main Reddit account....

It would be very hard to estimate the total number of miners however the whole network is currently operating at ~1,844,000,000 MH/s   (1.8 PH/s)
If we then pick a random number for the average mining power per operator... (good luck with that.... lets say....  10GH/S?????) that means 184,400 miners?   But really ya....  I have no idea how you would estimate that number accurately...
And as mentioned I suspect almost every country on the planet has SOMEONE mining...

The concept is you can pre-clear before boarding so the AC can unload in the states just like any normal domestic flight. This alleviates a lot of hassle / cost compared to having to ONLY fly to airports with available customs etc...
I keep my tinfoil tightly strapped, but this is one specific thing that I really don't have any problem with...

If BFL was a long con they would never have shipped a single unit of the ASICS, they would have taken money for as long as it was coming in, turned it into BTC and fucked off to some random country. 
Iv been involved with a hardware startup for the past 2 years and I can't even begin to count the number of setbacks, delays, ruined batches, etc we've encountered  And we were NOT doing anything as complex a developing our own chips.
I think the story of the BFL ASIC line is if anything one of being a little to overoptimistic at first coupled with trying to keep the boat afloat as more and more delays reduced the incoming cash flow. 
Why aren't they giving refunds... well guess what, its a small tech firm if they gave refunds to everyone who came late to the party they would be out of business in a week. 
Am I pissed that ill be lucky to see a return on my now 14 month old order.... Yes....   But do I think they have just been sitting in a corner jacking off for the past year doing nothing?   No...      Pre orders are always a gamble

I'm not in the states so this is a mute point on my end but:
Are there prohibitions for government regulated organizations refusing to do business with specific businesses? Especially when there are conflicts of interest present????
I recall some case studies from back in Uni about similar things in Canada where company A (near monopoly), refused to do business with company B for no other reason that they wanted to have company B fail.
The Competition Bureau got involved and Company A was fined and threatened with dissolution unless they complied with providing services to company B.
Any similar regulations/agencies state side?   Are banks regulated on a state or Federal level?
