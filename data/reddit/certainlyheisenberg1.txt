Not 10, but I still have a few.  Most recently sold at $4400 and $7500.  I've bought and sold on dips and peaks since 2013.

I have no idea if it will go higher.  I've bought a bunch since those transactions and sold a bunch.  I'm thrilled with how its performed but of course I could've done better.

At a glance you can't see dates but if you click on an individual order you can see all the info:

Sold a bunch more last week that I bought in $200's and have a few more in the bank.

Just give the info to my accountant and she works it out.

She's a beast.
Solid concrete, sided with bluestone, capped with stone.  Will have custom steel railings when finished rather than wrought iron.  Wider than code with a gate when it makes the turn.  It was expensive.
Here's a pic with more work to do:

Not sure yet.  I have an accountant who figures all that out.  Probably about 15%.
I think it's a fair question, not sure why you got downvoted to shit.

I get that.  That's why the 'kinda' in the title.  I still have BTC I purchased in the $200 range so I'm good.  I owe a lot to this currency.

Started a business.  Actually, a second location for my current business.  A wheelchair ramp cost $38,000.  I paid it with BTC profits.
