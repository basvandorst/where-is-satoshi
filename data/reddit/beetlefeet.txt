Not sure, but I imagine you need to get a BCH wallet program an export your private keys from electrum and import them into that new wallet.

Depends on exactly when you moved it. If it was before the fork block then the BTC and BCH are on the hardware wallet. If it was after then the BCH is still in the Electrum wallet. Regardless you can check your balances of each address at  to see for sure.

Why didn't so a once off difficulty tweak in the hard fork? Just assume some optimistic % of total hashrate (like 10%? 25%).

Must be pretty smart to be getting 6 confirmations in 30-40 minutes when the block time is 10 minutes on average.

No worries!

Sorry. I read your post as though it implied you get this behaviour as a standard occurance. Like something you could rely on, on average. Like you could expect to get 6 confirmations reliably in 30 to 40 minutes. I didn't realise you were only referencing some lucky occurrences and deliberately not referencing the times it took longer. (Just as many, on average!) 
Btw I have no love nor hate for BCH, just a random calling out some bad math, like cherry picking stats. Peace!

As I understood it the first huge run up to ~1k was because of crazy fraudulent goings on at MtGox where someone inside kept buying fake bitcoin with fake USD and the price kept going up. Then people couldn't withdraw USD because they were insolvent so people would buy more BTC to get out of MtGox, pushing the price up even more (and far above the price on other exchanges). The actual value was really much lower. If you remove or 'smooth over' that, believing it to be artificial then things don't seem so crazy.
I read a long analytical article about the MtGox situation including lots of compelling data from transactions and data obtained from MtGox servers. That strongly implied deliberate artificial price manipulation upwards. But I totally forget where/what it was called and don't have time to look now. &gt;&lt;
