Fiat isn't the only fallible form of currency in this regard. Many think that gold is a solid investment and get gold-backed securities, which are marginally backed up by physical.

Honest question. Should hackers from outside the US that steal money/information from US companies/individuals be exempt from legal repercussions?

What if that country has no laws against it? Are we to allow foreign entities to freely attack us? 
What if a Chinese company hacked a US counterpart to steal trade secrets? Do you really trust their government to stop them? Personally, I think it is fair for the US to indict them for crimes committed against US entities.

Even broader, Assange started editorializing the content of Wikileaks, choosing what would and wouldn't be posted. While I don't know this for sure, I've heard many of the original members of Wikileaks left over the past ~7 years due to their misgivings about Assange's influence over the content.

No, that was a single example. There are many instances where individual players can do similar hacks. For example, if we found an individual outside of the US was behind the Equifax hack, should that person be exempt from prosecution?

Using a hypothetical Robin Hood isn't addressing the main part of the argument though. Yes, legality doesn't dictate morality, and as a result it can sometimes be just to break an unjust law. 
That said, there are legitimate laws that aim to thwart malicious attacks, from within or outside-of the US.


I fully agree, and I find the ruling that they can't be subject to a class action for damages to be terrible. Thankfully [some did get in trouble]( . 
But that is moot. I'm just arguing that the government has a rational, valid reason for it's policies on prosecution of non-citizens for crimes against the people and property of the US. The US will also extradite to many other nations (ones which they are confident wouldn't be a source of spurious allegations).
That does not invalidate the journalists (/whistleblowers, /whoever) who seek to add transparency to government. Again, their actions may be just, even if they come in conflict with US law. Law and transparency can come into conflict, but that doesn't mean they are mutually exclusive. 
Perhaps the answer isn't that the prosecutorial position of the US isn't entirely wrong, but rather it needs more room/leniency for whistle blowers. Legislation could enable the greater transparency that journalists fight for, without hindering law enforcement's ability to pursue international criminals. 
I certainly respect your view as well, and appreciate your prioritization of transparency.

Is this strictly true? I thought they seized a sizable amount after the Mt. Gox shenanigans, and the FBI seized 26,000 coins associated with the Silk Road bust?

When Clinton repealed Glass-Steagall it also made it easier for a bank to 'lose' your money.
