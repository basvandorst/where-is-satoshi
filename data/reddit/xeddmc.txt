Lol. Good luck with that Norm. You obviously don't have a clue of what you're talking about. Only people getting 'Taxes' from us are the miners... *fkin politicians*

If I could upvote you multiple times I would.

No kit is complete without a few Valium and some ambien. Riding those waves can be hard on the nerves.
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:28:31
They need to implement some type of dead-mans switch (so to speak) for TX's over a set limit that says blatently "ARE YOU FKING SURE YOU WANT TO SEND 0.025BTC WITH A 25BTC FEE??!!"
If this were the case, I am sure we would instantly realize our error and click "No". Maybe a feature request is in order? ;3
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:25:49
Wow. BTC China, that is actually awesome. At least there still is honest folk among us. Makes me happy. Glad you didn't have to live through that more then a bit. I know I will be watching myself from now forward also. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:26:34
'Tis true.
@_date: 2014-10-10 16:05:16
:P That actually made me smile :)

@_date: 2014-09-03 18:23:11
i cant seem to find the option to buy anything with BTC here :(
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:24:43
Yup. That is what getting greedy does.
@_date: 2014-12-11 14:00:39
Totally agree man. Google used to be a "For the people" company, but has been getting greedier and greedier. Microsoft used to also be this way, but has been throwing surprises out there the past while. It's a nice change.
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:48:09
I think you definitely should. If you do, you can consider me a buyer, regardless of the game type.
What is the game type anyway? :P
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:30:52
Very well said my friend.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:27:33
It means I lost about 170K, or about 61,000$ in todays BTC value, for a 50$ investment.
@_date: 2014-09-01 20:03:27
If I knew what CoinByCall was I might be able to halp you :P
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:33:12
Lol, I made at the time 2,500$. Compare that to 170,000$ and it is pitiful in comparison.
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:38:59
Yeah. I feel better though kinda just getting it out there. I havn't talked about this to anyone, because I physically get sick when people around me in the real world, either don't believe me, or think I'm crazy. Oh well, you live and you learn I guess. Hopefully a chance like that will arise in my lifetime again.
@_date: 2015-05-31 11:07:13
I am willing to bet he would.
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:15:59
Hey thanks very much. Oh I am locked down everything from now on. I was too lax, and got too brave...Needless to say, I am downloading the QT now, and Armory is my next move.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:24:05
Yup, I had it encrypted. So looking into the virus further, it was a remote access backdoor, and according to this sophos report, it hides files containing info (passwords, and whatever else) then sends it to a no-ip.org dns host. Probably Darkcomet or something, but I am curious as to how he made it completely undetectable.. Regardless, it sucks losing that BTC and having to change every password on everything, as god only knows what info he *did* get..
@_date: 2014-10-10 15:28:09
2.5Million NXT, about 170K in december and today, about 61K...
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:45:05
Hey thanks man. Same here, unemployed and it really sucks. I have been doing freelancing on and off, I enjoy it, but might soon start my own project and see how things are lookin in a few months. :) Either game on my list you want? Please take one, because nobody else wants to XD, honestly everyone I buy these and usually give them away (There my doubles ) :P
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:29:36
Oh man! You guys don't have to do that. I just feel that what goes around comes around, and these people that invade us, will get their time. Look at mark karpeles. He said he got hacked...but now the japanese investigators are saying it was an inside job. So I would imagine his karma will be triple-bad now.
Thank you very much though and I really appreciate it. You guys want either game? I have more too, pm me if you would like a list :)
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:18:56
Yeah, crazy. It is truly sad that people just cannot live by a simple, so simple, rule: [Remember the human]( if they did, the internet would be a much better place.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:31:00
Oh thanks man! Damn guys, I honestly didn't expect anyone to give me anything, I just wanted to give folks some games :) But I appreciate it greatly :). DOES ANYONE WANT A GAME LOL!!!
@_date: 2015-01-10 15:44:53
Too good to be true :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:47:40
Dear god. If I had 500BTC in a wallet, I would have backups of backups encrypted over and over until I could just barely even access it myself. I really feel for you man. Fuck.
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:35:56
Yeah man, it really does suck. Beside feeling like you've been digitally violated, you also feel unsafe using your PC. This is the first bit of malware I have ever had (since I was a kid back in the Windows 95 days anyway).
I totally wiped my electrum wallet, and finally broke down and got the Bitcoin-QT with Armory. I am also thinking of investing in either a raspberyy pi and putting a hardware wallet on that, or buying a trezor. Situations like this make you re-evaluate your security options quickly.
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:16:43
So true. I am deeply disappointed with reddit's current leadership and stance.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:26:39
Hey man, thanks so much! You actually did not have to do that. But I appreciate it immensely. Want either game? :)
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:32:42
I will look into getting one of these actually.
@_date: 2015-01-09 15:05:54
Yeah, just be careful with TGTBT prices, and be sure to always use person-to-person or cash deposit trades. I sold some BTC a while back to someone with crazy good rates, and he turned out to be using a fraud account, which in turn got me tied up in a fraud case that I had no idea about. :(
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:25:13
Hey bud. Yeah a lot of peeps would look at 0.17BTC as literal dust, but to some who don't usually buy BTC and work for it, can be de-motivating to say the least.
@_date: 2015-01-24 18:44:17
Hey, Yeah I have skyrim &amp; beat it too many times :P My steam library has about 300 games, so there's a lot I still need to play :P. Yeah I always live by that code, and it has made my life on the net and physical, much happier. It is a very logical code.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:25:36
:) No worries, thanks much.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:26:28
Thanks man, means a lot. :)

Best mug ever created ever
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:10:29
The keys are all private keys in existence. Just the chances of finding anything is exponentially small.
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:56:30
Thats actually pretty cool. I didn't know this. :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:07:55
We really need a decentralized exchange..or all exchanges should have to use Multi-sig..:'(
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:39:33
Bter is in the top 10 I believe. But I agree. This is not the first time they have had breaches. I avoided them after the first breach.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:36:27
Oh man :( Fuck dude, I hope coinbase will reimburse you :( If they don't, let us know. I don't have much, but Ill send you what I can. I got scammed a while back too, sucks bad man. I know your pain, and it is an absolute terrible feeling. :'( \*Hugs @_date: 2015-02-15 14:43:50
They are up there. According to a few sites, they are in the top 10, averaging at number 10. Which, when compared to the amount of exchanges in existence, is no small feat.
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:49:56
I like this. You just gained yourself another user.
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:49:03
Agreed. If he *Must* then use a multi-sig wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:35:08
Haha shit thanks! ;D
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:48:58
It's official....
7170 BTC got stolen from our cold wallet in this transaction:
720 BTC bounty for chasing it back.
All wallets have been shut down and withdrawals of unaffected coins will be arranged later."
Sorry to all who lost funds in this shit... :'(
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:02:27
inputs.io, mtgox, bitcurex flashbacks....
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:55:17
You seem to be missing the whole point. It is mindless fun. I don't expect to become a millionaire. It is just the thrill of knowing that somewhere in that mass of pages, lies actual coins. The chances may be less than the chances of finding a 2 tonne diamond in your backyard, but it is still fun nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:42:41
Very cool.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:48:26
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:57:10
Yup, clearly something was overlooked or half-assed. But let's hope that all of these exchanges hacked in the past couple days, is not a 0day exploit commonality between the code used or modules used within the code. If this is the case, then a lot of other exchanges could be in trouble, and perhaps any other service that uses the vulnerable code...
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:47:32
Crypto is secure. The centralized exchanges are at fault here. Not the currency itself. That is like saying that because someones bank account was hacked that it was the dollars fault.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:52:28
Yeah lol, I was wondering what he was talking about :P Should I edit the quote?
@_date: 2015-02-05 17:09:16
It is not a joke. The keys are actual keys, I tested them. Just the chances of finding one is incomprehensibly small. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:29:17
That could be true, I actually never thought of that. It would make sense that if they are afraid of a breach, that they would assume that everything, including Cold wallets are compromised, so they would move them to new wallets. Let's hope this is the case.
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:36:55
I AM VIRTUALLY YELLING ON REDDIT IN HOPES OF RECEIVING A CHANGETIP BIT!!!!!11!!!!!!!1 :D
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:43:35
Yeah I use zTrader already, I am actually in the Beta testing group for it too :). I am hoping to find a Mac or windows (or Linux) based platform, or even a free alternative for something like Coinigy or Cryptrader. Someone mentioned Zeroblock, and it is great for BTC/USD trades, but does not (yet) support Poloniex or Bittrex :(
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:57:10
Hell yeah it would. I read somewhere yesterday that we're only like 10-15 years away from Harddrive/SSD-type storage mediums with Synthetic DNA at its core. Super cool.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:25:29
TIL there are only 3 addresses with 100,000 Bitcoins in them. Can you imagine having 100K BTC? I believe I just shat myself.
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:29:37
Yes. OMG yes!
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:59:14
lol. When the site is showing an html page saying that almost 2 million dollars USD was stolen, and the users accounts and wallets are frozen..usually that means they are screwed..
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:59:12
I would grab the BTC. Naturally.
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:41:49
Yeah, it is a terrible feeling when this shit happens. Not a good feeling at all..
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:44:11
lolol. If nothing else, they at least have grammar :P
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:34:44
I feel your pain. But, my friend, we shall redeem ourselves when the first DNAcoin comes out, whereby there is a network of decentralized synthetic DNA strands with encrypted data on them that we must mine with whatever the fuck the inventor uses to mine it. Then, we shall be redeemed. Then.
Yes my friend, we are living in the future. Yes. Reference: 
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:57:53
Damnit.. *facepalm*
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:50:01
There really needs to be preventative measures for ***all*** exchanges. It may be a hassle to really secure everything, and may cost you a chunk of money, but in the long run, you would be thanking your past-self.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:51:24
Thanks lol, I was wondering what that said.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:53:03
That was me saying that, what BTER wrote is in quotes lol.
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:39:17
Oh snap! This zeroblock is a first-time-heard-of for me :) Looks great judging by the website. Thanks man!
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:28:04
Yeah, I think the reports of 7,200BTC stolen are true, not looking good.. I am SO glad I stopped using Bter since their last security breach.
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:13:46
Yup, after the first time I avoided them like the plague. Especially when they started to tax and limit the users extremely... 
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:03:00
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:14:41
Has* gone down in flames.
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:32:18
NOSTALGIA OVERLLOOADDDDDDDDD
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:23:21
IKR. Trezor is jealous, and just pissed that someone took their OPENSOURCED software and used it...like it was meant to be used. If you didn't want others using your firmware, you should have kept it closed source and 'copyright' it. God, you should be happy that more are being made, because at least you can say they are using your code, and that you were the first.
On that not. I just ordered a Bwallet. 28$? Can't go wrong ;)
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:47:24
Not if their means of storing the cold wallets private keys was compromised. Until we get the full scoop from bter or whomever investigates this, i'm holding off assumptions. The only assumption I can make with 100% certainty is that this is the second time they have been compromised, IMO, after the first time they should have allocated that 720BTC into securing their servers, and protecting their customers. That's just my opinion. Last time they got hacked, they made the users pay it back with outrageous fees and limits. If this doesn't shut them down, I bet they will tax the users again hard. I am glad I don't use them any longer..
@_date: 2015-02-16 14:09:15
lol. This is funny, especially if you actually believe it.
@_date: 2015-02-07 18:13:09
Am I the only person who automatically had red flags bigger than Russia go up when I clicked the link and seen "Enter your credit card number" on a shady ass HTML webpage?
Edit: Nope guess not. Looks like anyone with 1/10th of a brain is avoiding this.
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:41:26
Email would probably be the best. Or call them.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:48:53
hahaha You made me smile :D
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:44:09
QR code in a hat.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:53:07
Lol, it actually is not a joke. Every address you see there, the private key is valid. I've checked some. The point of the whole site is the fact that finding an address within all of those pages that has anything on them is so minute that you have a better chance of winning the lottery than you do this. But it is fun to try nonetheless. That is all the site is for, fun. Those that are saying the site is a 'joke' are correct if they find it funny for people to try and find an address with coin in it, but every key there is valid and legitimate. 
It may be futile as fuck but I find it therapeutic and a good time-waster when you just want to zone out. :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:56:22
Would be super cool if you could edit the source code to switch to different altcoins you add to it.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:54:00
This as well. A very big possibility.
