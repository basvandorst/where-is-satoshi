It looks crazy because you are watching btc oscillate between low and high values. These levels are higher than anyone expected btc to be a year ago at this time. Anyone who bought btc in 2017 below 5k never expected it to hit 10k before year end.  So 14/15k is still high. 
If anyone tells you we will dip back to 5k, or even 8k, they're a fucking idiot who knows nothing about the space and they are just projecting their wishes because they regret not buying back then.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:10:54
I distinctly remember people making optimistic posts last year's before the August BS about hitting 5k by year end. We went to 4x that.
I honestly did not understand why it was going up so quick. Then stories of people taking out loans/mortgaging to buy bitcoin came out.
There you go. The media kept talking about how bitcoin had broken 5k again and had now broken 7500 and then 10k. Add to that the delay in actually getting set up to buy btc, or to take out loans for it, etc, and we got a true bull run. 10-15k in no time. Then it went to 19k. Too much gains in too short a time. Any cautious investor speculating with a small portion of their portfolio would sell at this point. Any jackass who didn't know anything about bitcoin but heard McAfee said $1m in 2 years all of a sudden became convinced and bought at 19k.
Not enough jackasses were willing to buy enough at 4x the price anyone expected. But clearly this means btc is dead

Ignore anyone telling you "wait til it drops to x". These are armchair speculators and anyways you are basing your strategy, if that's what you want to call it, on something very risky. Essentially, you are trying to bet (by waiting for the price to drop to the bare minimum) that even though this thing is worth more than it's selling for now everyone else is dumber than you and will wait longer than you to buy in.
Buy some, even just a little, right now, and a little more in a week or two, etc., if you are worried about the price dipping more. If it goes down you only bought some at the higher price, if it goes up, at least you got some at the lower price.

I feel sorry for those who bought btc after Aug 1st. Must be hard not having the same amount of btc as BCH. For me, this is all a show as I have no intention of trying to trade either. I'm here to wait and see which fork wins, and while I still believe bitcoin will beat bcash, I'm not going to blow my load trying to trade all my BCH for btc. If I did Murphy would pump BCH to the moon right after, that's just my luck. By holding  both, I help ensure market stability. I will let those with crystal balls worry about trading to whatever their chosen chain is.

The danger here is that if btc goes 2x-4x in a short time span like a month or two ago, alts will tank as many are measured/traded in btc. If things go well they will stabilize, but if your traded btc for alts under 3k, not many of those alts kept pace in dollar value with btc rising to 18k, because they would have had to go 6x.

Ok people, I don't know if there's really that many stupid people out there, but expecting to buy coffee with bitcoin anytime soon is dumb.
Will you be able to buy it with btc in the future? Perhaps. Will you be able to buy coffee with some kind of crypto or some secondary chain (a la LN?) Yes.
Bitcoin has already been solidified as a store of value, so long as no one is able to "hack bitcoin"(in extremely vague laymen terms).
Remember, 10 minutes is a fucking nanosecond to a farmer in a 3rd world country. Besides, at some level you rely on trust for instantaneous transactions anyways. 
If I can load a crypto wallet with btc in about 10 minutes, and after that I can spend that other crypto in seconds/transact bitcoin on a secondary chain in seconds, I'm good.

I almost did this. Sold part of my stash at 2944, figuring itll drop down to 2800-2850 soon. It dropped to 2935 and then began increasing rapidly. Barely bought back in at 2945 before it rocketed up past 3k. Lost probably 10 or 15 bucks in transaction fees and that one dollar gap but I'm just relieved I sat there and watched it after selling. It was literally 5 minutes between me selling and me buying back in because the price was jumping. If I had set my phone down for 5 minutes I'd have missed it.
Moral of the story, playing the market is much more stressful than hodling. Just hodl and dont worry about the price.

I wouldnt risk engaging in it though. Good way to have the gov seize your assets, potentially more than just what you won gambling. Same with illegal gambling: you lose unfairly, no recourse. Win too much and they can simply refuse to pay. Or if youre at some shady underground casino, you can easily have an accident between winning and getting to your car. And even if things went smoothly, now you have to launder it which is more crimes you could potentially be charged with. I would simply list it as gambling wins and pay taxes on it but even that is technically illegal.

Does anyone seriously believe there arent fucking whales out there from the old days when people were mining tens of thousands of btc on their PCs? Sure the vast majority sold by 1000, but you have to assume there are some diehard btc pioneers with thousands upon thousands of btc stashed away that cost them virtually nothing.
Think about it. If you had tens of thousands of btc, you could play around with 90+% of it and still know youre set for life even if you lost it. And if you knew what you were doing, or lets say, had several years and almost unlimited funds to teach yourself (like the entire time from the first spike to 1000 till now), you would be amassing even more.
Of course it could always just be some billionaire/s fucking around. If thats the case all we have to do is wait for more hedge funds to come in and they will naturally balance each other out.

Sign up an GDAX, find out what code to put in the message line and just wire the money. I sent 10000 and it showed up in my account same day (i did it bwdore 1pm pst). It doesnt buy btc for you it just puts the money in your gdax usd account so youre ready to buy whenever you want instantly, or you can set a limit order at whatever price you want to pay and itll automatically buy btc for you when it goes down to that level. If youre buying a whole bitcoin or more just go with wire transfer or be ready to wait for days or weeks to buy all you want

Yeah its technically always a good time to buy if you see bitcoin at a higher price in the future, but if it's gaining 30% in less than a month you have to expect a dip at some point.
The only real solution is to decide how much bitcoin you want to have at the very least, and buy that much at the current price if you have the funds. Or decide how much of your portfolio you are willing to put in and buy at least half now. If the price rises and rises and never dips, thats great. Feeling like you missed out on even more gains is not that bad compared to never getting in in the first place.

I dont plan on touching any fork simply for tax reasons. I may put them into an IRA or something if possible in the future, but only if I think that fork has an actual chance of surviving long term.

Goldman says 4500-5000, then a plunge as low as 2200. Masterluc predicted 40-110k though for this long term bullish trend. If we got anywhere near that you'd have to be foolish not to sell some of your holdings (selling 10% would give you your money back and 90% free btc even buying now at 4k).
10k is obviously the greatest psychological and mathemaatical resistance level. So much profit to be gained between here and then, it will take a lot of cash to buy those coins.
We are seeing it right now as well. If you sat on your btc having bought in '13-'16, you're looking at serious gains. There's already been posts from people saying they are now millionaires with this 4000k spike (250 BTC, so either dumped 60k at 250 or bought pre 2013). 
Naturally it is cash out time for them, at least partially. It only makes sense to take advantage of the overall devaluation of fiat currencies. And besides, it's still easier to buy a house or something with cash than btc. Physical property, especially big things like real estate, is still just as valuable as BTC, so really they are just buying with their BTC and having to use the tired old banking system  as a middleman.
Those types of transactions are coming to a blockchain near you. Expect less supply when that happens, and the btc/usd market itself to split in correlation with the btc/other crypto markets, like the way we see ethereum and litecoin forming their own patterns currently. Wall St will be there to capture their arbitrage until they realize themselves the uselessness of debt backed money.
Its great to be wary about the future price of bitcoin and all, as it does generally signify, genuine concern or optimism about the future, but what people don't understand I think is that if you believe in the power of what bitcoin represents then you have to acknowledge that no other crypto, and I care not about anything other than a theoretical comprimsing of bitcoin neteork security here, will ever, ever replace it.
I'm sorry to all of you so wrapped in your ego that you can't understand it, but human beings will not, if they ever do wise up to the beauty of cryptocurrency, accept anything but the original bitcoin. Authenticity is fucking priceless folks, and even at 100sat/coin any alt trying to be bitcoin is a bad deal. Don't waste your time with anything more than hedging your bets. If it's a fork, just hodl your new alt coins, or ignore them like I did as paying attentiom to them only distracts from our ultimate goal here.

Tony Robbins' book on money is great if you want sound fundamental investment advice and lots of warnings about hidden/glossed over/"oh these are minimal" type fees and other losses waiting for the average individual investor that will make a huge difference 10 or 20 years down the line (hundreds of percent possibly). No get rich quick schemes or any of that, just sound overall long term investing advice and warnings.
I mention the book because in it he talks about Vanguard (and recommends it as well). I also found out about Robinhood through that book (also mentioned on some subs I'm sure). Free stock trading, no $10 a trade bs. They make money with the gold subscription, if you want more buying power (ie lending) and other more "trader" type features. And the gold subscription is like $10 a month if I remember right, so still very reasonable.

I had the opposite experience trading alts during the aug 1 fiasco, though I did not wager nearly as much as you did. I put 10/15% of my btc into alts that I saw going down as aug 1 approached, basically a handful of 0.1btc investments. My theory was that people were dumping alts for btc to get more of that sweet shitcoin caysh after the fork, which they would gleefully dump and then proceed to come back to their alts, as well as those who didnt sell their alts buying more with their extra btc. Everything I bought I set a limit order to sell half at twice my purchase price to get my money back. I figure if nothing else at least I diversified my holdings, but anything that I get my btc back out of leaves me with "free"alts.
Some didnt work naturally (just sold my sia for a 40/50%loss). However, a few such as neo, mysterium, civic, and a couple others worked out, or were at least up after the fork if they hadnt spiked 100%. All in all I profited about 0.8 btc on ~1.4 invested.
I don't judge you for gambling more though, everybody falls at some point. Just hodl for 20k and youll still have more than doubled your investment.

Long term meaning discount this year. So at ~1100 ATH, we're looking at 2200-3300. I think its pretty damn accurate considering Goldman expects a major correction as low as 2200, meanwhile a target price of 10k means 3300 is still a 300% potential upside short term.
The dip  will only go as low as traders' self control will allow. They all know bitcoin is undervalued as we speak. I would buy more if I could afford it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:06:32
Yep. $30 fee is insignificant if you plan on purchasing a full bitcoin or more, especially when its going up by more than that in the 4 to 5 days it takes other methods to clear (or a week if buying through the coinbase app, $2000/week limit)

Given that exchanges like coinbase have chosen in the past to credit their users with an equal amount of btc that they held at the time of the fork, it's not much concern to long term holders. Sure they arent getting their free coins immediately but at the end of the day all they really would miss out on is the chance to dump it right after the fork. If you're a long term holder then you wouldn't be trying to dump anyways, you hold till you know which chain is dead

You are stupid and should feel bad as well as anyone who didn't laugh at that statement. Best of luck in your future endeavors, but smarten the fuck up fool.
Whatever level you think will lead to a crash if it breaks, chances are it barely goes below that and skyrockets. Whatever price you thought was gonna be just before the price drops, it's gonna drop right before that, every time.
Unless you have enough btc invested that you can quit your day job and live off of 2%gains per week or less just hold. I have made similar mistakes as you just only with 1/10 or less of my holdings because at the end of the day predicting market price is akin to gambling aside from being able to use stop loss etc.

No, this is the market realizing that pieces of paper are the way to go. You can touch paper. Paper cant be hacked. Btc is dead

China is a largely homogenous country woth highly concentrated political power. It will act like a selfish brat for the near future and must be spanked until it behaves

Do not buy at ATH, thats stupid, unless you are able to make the payments on your loan with your income, and have nerves of steel, because the price could come down and stay down for an extended period of time

Is 3950 close enough?

"There are only 300,000 holders of at least $5000 worth of bitcoin"
Any credibility to that?

That he would pay them back with interest.
Seriously though more than likely its an equity loan or something, banks arent going to just loan you money to buy btc with, unless you have collateral to back it with

There were rumors of russia and china collaborating to establish a new currency standard outside the petrodollar.
This was going to happen anyway as we move away from fossil fuels for energy/gas. 
China is already pioneering bitcoin mining (hello cheap coal energy), and Russia is gearing up to enter the space bigly.
China is not going to ban the most promising alternative to the US Dollar in modern history.

1% in 2 days, or 160% per year, lets say 100% to be conservative. Sounds about right.

Bitcoin is the future of currency, so what is future of other sectors/industries? Ethereum has it's place, and other cryptos will find theirs (perhaps some other coin will replace btc, but I personally doubt it), but what about the rest of the world economy outside crypto? 
One of the biggest is energy. Solar and fusion are two different solutions which will both most likely be used(and increase in usage) for decades to come. Solar provides a decentralized energy source, whereas fusion will provide energy for cities/industry(and most certainly a vast array of military/heavy industry applications. Thus, household energy demands and lower can be met or at least mitigated by solar, providing it a foothold into the future, whereas fusion holds the promise of *almost* free energy, but with the cost of being an extremely volatile, and therefore risky, energy source, requiring centralization(the government is not going to allow people to just run their own fusion reactors in their backyard. Think of a water heater exploding times a million if something goes wrong) so you have solar and fusion to invest in.
For transportation, look to uber or other ridesharing services. As soon as thay can, uber/lyft/google themselves will be amassing a fleet of self driving vehicles. Every city where a significant portion of the population do not own cars is going to be flooded with these things. Setbacks aside (yes, some robocar is going to end up in an accident that might even be the other (human) drivers fault, and this will cause a setback. But it will recover) that industry is also going through the roof in the next 10 years. Just wait till dominos starts robodelivering pizzas.
Last but not least, 3D printing. This is manufacturing/production made obsolete for most basic items. Sure, it'll be a long time before you can 3d print a microwave for yourself, but when you can print simple things, like a longhandle plastic spoon/spatula for cooking, cheaper than it would cost to drive to the store and buy one, or a tupperware container, or an action figure, etc., the public will change it's view of the technology. Once you see how ridiculously simple it is to use it, you understand why it is inevitable.

This happened earlier in the week, someone dumped 1000btc and set off other peoples stop losses/caused additional panic selling. To completely crash we would need catastrophic news about btc's future in addition to multiple 500-1000 btc selloffs. Even then we are unlikely to go below 2500 again as its already been established as a significant support level (I think because people expect 10k/btc soon so anything below 2500 is a chance to quadruple your money or more).
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:35:38
Yep. And I still dont see anyone planning on buying the shit anyways. All these people nutting over "free money" must know of some billionaire buffoon planning to corner the bch market. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:33:36
You're probably gonna have a bad time day trading in crypto. This market follows similar patterns but is still very different from stocks, especially for alt coins since theyre such new markets.
There are ways to predict short term swings in the market, and ways to minimise and offset loss. However, you need to be on the computer all day in order to employ them effectively.
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:19:28
Yep. I dont trade any alts currently but I'm sure there's quite a few traders taking advantage of the undervalued coinage. These people selling their alts to buy btc to try and sell their bch are risking a lot. When the price goes to nothing they will either have to hodl their newfound btc or try to sell it, which will end up being at a loss most likely as we are unlikely to break 3k before bcc blows over, and the price will probably go down slightly because of people selling to try annd get back into their alt coins. Silly. They are all thinking the next person after them will be a bigger idiot essentially. Who they plan to sell their DOA shitcoin to still escapes me as the consensus seems to be the bch is worthless and is only worth getting ahold of because its "free money"

Yes. Should go through same day if done before 1pm PST

Btc can be divided into 8 decimal places, so could be worth $1m/btc and still break down to cents. 20m coins =$20 trillion. The whole world could use btc and still break transactions down to cents.
You could make it $100 trillion if we just round transactions to the nearest nickel, or ultimately $2 quadrillion if transactions are done in whole dollars. By the time the world has that much wealth rounding off to dollars will feel like rounding off to nickels.
