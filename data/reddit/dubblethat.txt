I have wanted to practice but simply eft'd cash to a wallet, bought bitcoin at 550 and sold when it was up at least 20%, at 700.... Only prblem was that i use the  app to track prices, and when it showed the mtgox price at 700 my wallet, coinbase, would only sell it for me at. 660!  This stinks!
So, i was thinking i should get mtgox wallet but everyone blogging says you CANNOT get your money outta there soon enough to buy/sell as a day trader.... And in reading their FAQ disclosures they are daying withdrawals are taking 1 month to 2 months?!?!
Got an fixes for me to be able to get cash in FAST, in minutes when the 'SELLOFF' happens?  Also, how do i know if im getting realtime quotes or 30 minutes delays??

I take Anti Money Laundering courses every year for CE in the financial services industry; this sounds like that textbook example of money laundering where the criminal is willing to let you have 10-20% of the deposit to (Stage 1) Introduce it into accepted banking circles in exchange for having your person at risk (Stage 2) layer in the total amount with multiple deposits under the 'alert limits', called 'Layering' and (Stage 3) Remove it as 'cleaned money'.   
Im looking for biz opps in this new field, but no amount of money is worth selling your integrity and/or being pulled into a criminal ring as their 'money launderer'.  Even if the branch manager IS letting you do it, it might be just to get a sting on the launderer.... Dude- you should be REAL CAREFUL
