this is the calculation:
\(high price\- current price\)\*100/current price
Calculating with BTC:
\(19,535 \- 8,437\) \* 100/8,437 = 131
Growth: 131&amp;

is the percentage of growth of the current price until reaching the highest price , BTC example:
Current Price: $8,43792
High Price: $19,535
Growth, current price up to the high price: 131&amp;

I want to share with you a project that I made, it is very simple, that create a estimate of how much each coin would cost if it had the same market of Bitcoin (Capitalization of the market), All of the data are obtained from CoinMarketCap and are updated constantly.
All of your sugestions are welcome.
