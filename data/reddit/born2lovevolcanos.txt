A clever investor isn't buying mining hardware. They buy bitcoins directly.

This is really bad circular logic.
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:20:09


It most certainly is elitist, but that doesn't make it wrong.


That's not what it's about, though. It was about a decline in quality in some newsgroups after that point, not how the Internet was now doomed to failure.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:38:04


That's not what I'm saying at all. You might get that impression reading this thread, but that's because I'm trying to throw out all of these absurd arguments like, "He CANT be the real Satoshi because Satoshi wrote this technical paper."
I believe there's other circumstantial evidence which is pretty good. Example, the fact that as soon as the journalist brought up Bitcoin, he suddenly ceased communication.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:41:24


Really? Maybe it was just where I worked, but there were definitely some people that I thought could have put something like that together if they cared to. Not the majority, certainly, but there were a few guys around that seemed like the type that were into more intellectual pursuits than others.


I've seen very well written technical papers come from people that I could barely understand when they were speaking English, so this point really doesn't work for me.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:45:13
We don't know if that's the case, though.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:22:33
Why would he buy mining equipment?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:10:20
Congratulations, you got the point. He provided a link between his Tor identity and his real identity.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:18:57


Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:46:43


Right, before you could just buy them on an exchange.


Why? It's cheaper to buy Bitcoins than it is to mine them. The fact that he was mining them **before** they could be easily bought doesn't change this.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:08:36
Ross Ulbricht had millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin and lived in a rented room. What's this supposed to mean?
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:28:39
The real DPR trying to hire help using his real name on an account with the same username he used to promote SR sounds ridiculously unbelievable to me as well, but here we are. 
All told, Dorian Nakamoto seems to have the same sort of misunderstanding of privacy that Satoshi, who believed that a system of money where every transaction is logged was truly anonymous, does. It's not proof, but it provides a good amount of internal consistency. All of his misunderstandings and flaws mean you can't rule this man being Satoshi out.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:44:09
And how do you know it hasn't been hacked? How do you know it's not Dorian Nakamoto making those posts?
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:45:42
And look at all the poor saps who have lost all their money in the markets because they tried to do similar.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:17:43
He could very well have thought that saying he was no longer involved was enough to get people to leave him be and, when that turned out to not be the case, changed his story. That doesn't sound implausible or unlikely to me. He says what he thinks needs to be said to be left alone.
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:18:37
1)-3), no, I would expect a bit of a laugh. People doing classified work tend to find conspiracy theories funny.
4), no, I'd expect something more along the lines of, "I can't discuss that." Even if it were something I'd expect, though, that's not what happened. When asked about his working life, he was evasive. When asked about Bitcoin, he stopped talking altogether.
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:43:20


Not if there were police there.
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:56:49


I remember thinking the same of DPR.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:05:03
Wanting to be left alone is a motive.


People not believing he's really Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:55:54
Yeah, and everyone doubted DPR would leave a clear association between his darknet persona and his real name, didn't we?
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:34:45


He wouldn't know what evidence she has.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:53:35


That eliminates just about every job on the planet unless you're an attractive young woman.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:48:03


Yes, I don't believe that's what happens. I know a metric ton of people who have done classified work, and his story that he said that in reference to classified work doesn't at all ring true to me. That, on top of all of the circumstantial evidence (his personality matching that of someone who would want to keep himself on the down low, Satoshi leaving the BTC community around the time Dorian started having life problems, etc) make me inclined to believe he is in fact Satoshi. It might not be a bulletproof case, but it's certainly much stronger than those in this echo chamber (who, though they may not want to admit it, are quite biased in this matter) are saying it is.
I will say though, either way, he should not have had his identity and address revealed by Newsweek.
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:28:07
Newsweek posts story fairly light on details... what bastards!
Some guyon a forum posts a message claiming he's not the guy in question, with no proof at all, and its as good as the word of god.
The cognitive dissonance here is astonishing.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:15:50


Or just assume he's not telling the truth? He was corresponding with the Newsweek journalist through e-mail. One of the most cited pieces of 'evidence' that he couldn't possibly be the real Satoshi is an e-mail he wrote regarding some piece of local politics. It's fairly obvious that he has internet access.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:16:57
He's probably lying. This doesn't add credibility to his denials.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:48:04
Right, because no one's ever lied before, right?
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:35:48
a) He understands technology but not people. Pretty standard for reclusive engineering/math/science types. Further, he was probably a bit distressed (which would be why he called the cops), so slipping up in the moment wouldn't be all that surprising. You know what I find even more incredulous? That so many people can refuse to believe he would make such a mistake, but fully believe he can think he's being ask about "classified work" when he was being asked about "Bitcoin."
b) Because of this mistake, I'd put the probability of him being Satoshi at only 70-75%, as opposed to 90% otherwise.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:26:11


I have as well, and I agree.


You lost me here. The fact that he fits in with the defense industry doesn't challenge, in my mind, the idea that he's the real Satoshi.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:03:01
His responses, which he's admitted he actually said, don't match up with what someone who has done classified work would say about it either, though. Especially the part where he said, "other people have taken that over". If he was talking about classified government work, the response is typically, "I can't talk about that." because you actually can't talk about that.
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:05:28
No, they'll just send you to prison.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:46:55
I'm kind of with you. While it'd be cool to know, I kind of like the mystery of not being sure. Analogy time: the picture I had painted of DPR was much more appealing than the reality of Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:12:26
It wouldn't be a conspiracy for him to log into his own account and deny that he is who the media thinks he is. It would just be a lie.
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:52:42
Does that mean the quote is inherently wrong?
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:04:33
If you don't think they're your property then you can't go around getting mad if someone manages to take them from you.
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:13:31


That's a straw man if I've ever seen one. You don't have to be a master spy to switch to a formal style of English to write a research paper. There are countless graduate students in the US that don't speak English very well at all and then manage to write technical papers in a very formal style with good grammar.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:17:48
He'd have to prove that Newsweek thought what they published was false and that it caused him damages.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:20:16


You **must** be joking. This will only make it more tempting.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:09


There are a lot of libertarians here. They would strongly disagree with you on this point.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:22:15


Talk about a roflcopter man.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:13:30
How are they going to work this? Convert it to cash straightaway? How will they deal with contribution limits, which are specified in dollars? This seems like a legal mess.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:33:24
Or you could have just bought that many bitcoins and been out less money.
