Spoofing and other market manipulation are definitely illegal, at least in the US and Europe. And high frequency trading market manipulation has definitely been a part of financial markets since at least the mid-2000s.

This will be at 2800 in 2 days. Sell 1/3 now and buy back in for easy 5% more bitcoin. Volatility ftw

Sold 1/3 of my btc at 3190. It will be 28-2900 in two days. Will buy back at that price for 5% additional btc. Trend is much higher but if you think there's no volatility, you're crazy. Volatility is what makes btc so amazing. Compound interest on steroids.

Volatility ftw. 5-10% daily price swings. Sell 1/3 your coins when it has big spikes and then set a 5-10% down reentry. Compound interest on steroids

This is bigger than most people think. The law also bans all trading in any virtual currency, conversion of any virtual currency to fiat, or even quoting prices. Crypto is done in China, probably because they are developing their own virtual yuan...

I read that too. And in some way, it's kind of intuitive in the sense that coins derive value from being sold at (hopefully) higher prices to later participants. But you could say that about almost any stock, and it's not like a traditional ponzi at all. JPM are just talking their book while they develop their own competing coin. Hypocrites, liars and thieves.

JP was one of the largest buyers yesterday

Drug smuggling and money laundering didn't get people's attention, so now they attempt to tie bitcoin to North Korea. I see what you did there ... very clever Mr. Dimon.

o many people (smart) people have wrestled with the concept of the bitcoin "bubble." Even billionaire financiers have had trouble wrapping their mind around it. Concepts like "out of thin air" have been tossed around because traditional financial models don't quantify its value. (Some are coming up with models based on network effects, which are probably the most accurate). But let's compare B to the Onegram project: Each token on the blockchain is backed up by one gram of gold. When I was thinking about investing in this ICO, I originally thought "this is it. this is the next thing." And it was only by this comparison, that I realized why B is so valuable. Because it has no reference point other than it's supply, it can be valued at whatever price point we want. Its like a pre-revenue tech company. Why do many VCs prefer pre-revenue companies? Because they justify the insane valuations of "Unicorns". In other words, a Unicorn gets valued on its "potential" profits, which allows whatever P/E "ratio" we want. The same with B. There is no "intrinsic" value for us to use as a denominator. Because it is not attached to anything, like a gram of gold, B's value is shrodinger's cat. The reason goldgram will not pop is because we know EXACTLY what it's value is at all times. And for this reason, B's true "intrinsic" is that it is the finest, most sophisticated medium of exchange ever built. Owning B opens a door to exchange value anywhere, at any time, at whatever price we want. And that market is HUGE.

I love how everyone here is an expert in US securities law!

This encroaching regulation does not bode well for the future of bitcoin.

They won't close their doors to US consumers but may de-list some altcoins

An SEC enforcement action or a securities class action at worst. For this reason, I suspect US exchanges will stop trading coins they believe qualify as securities. There are intricacies as to what qualifies as an "exchange" that are beyond the scope here but the moral is to tread carefully with alt-coins.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:27:34
The problem with this opinion is that it suggests that exchanges that transact in crypto-securities must register with the SEC. Exchange registration is an extremely rigorous process, because under  Federal law, exchanges enjoy a pseudo – governmental status.
So essentially what will happen, is that each exchange will now look at all cryptos currently listed, and de-list those that could arguably qualify as a security under the "Howey test."  If they don't, they will be forced to meet the near impossible requirements of registering as an exchange under the Exchange Act of 1934.
In other words, certain shitcoins have a strong likelihood of being delisted and essentially valueless in the United States. Bitcoin and true currencies could never pass the test of a security so they should be fine. But do your own research as to what qualifies as a security and look at the coins you own. And do it now before the legal departments at kraken et al do it for you.
