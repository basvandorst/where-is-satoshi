So you come to this forum, a place of massive unfamiliarity and claim the people know nothing. Lay off the crack old chap and be humble in your knowingness.

Long story short. My usual place, coinbase to buy btc was limited so was snooping around to see where is best to buy.  Tried a few places and settled with local bitcoin,  but I'm sure I was in a few places that would be best to steer clear from.  Lesson fucking learned.
