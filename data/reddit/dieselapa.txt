I think he´s trying to say that price fluctuations would be smaller in percentage terms by that time, as the utility would be more established, price would have had longer to stabilize and the market to discover the price, as well ass much larger amounts of money needed to move the price a certain percentage point.
In real money terms the variance might be greater, but in percentage terms much lower.

This is great!
Now, if someone just built a service on top of this, automatically converting to fiat, and exporting the data for accounting. Then when lightning network gets integrated, merchants can easily accept btc as payment, and give a discount even with trading spread and fees, due to no risk of charge backs.

Historically this is not true. It's only the last year that it has been a good decision to also have other cryptocurrencies in your portfolio. And during that time pretty much none of those other coins have shown any actual use, other than speculation. If they don't have anything to show for it soon, I think we will regress back to the default of BTC being a better financial allocation than a basket of altcoins.
Spot on with the traditional investments however.

It will be interesting to see how they solve it technically. I mean, how anonymous can it be if they run all of the verification servers. If they don't, then what would incentivize someone to run one, and why would I trust them to keep my transactions private.
I'm pretty sure that what it will turn into is that transaction will be anonymous in the terms of no private actors getting to know your transactions. The state will have total insight into your "cash" transactions.

I look at versions of johoe's charts almost daily. It only indirectly shows what fee sizes get confirmed, but it does seem to indicate that the numbers are in the ballpark. I agree that you were right on that and that I was wrong.
It is, however, not apparent from the first graph you posted. You can probably figure it out if you mentally overlay the graph with a Bitcoin price graph, and mentally make a conversion of the dollar values to BTC values. But the graph does give a pretty good indicator of you trying to push an agenda, out of a discussion that had nothing to do with that. 


That's your opinion. You are part of that community, and apparently you are also a dev, so why haven't you done your job?
I do agree that it would be better if the fees were lower, but there are other factors to consider as well, which both the devs and community have done and discussed at length for the last few years.
Back to what we were actually discussing. It is possible to exchange many transactions with different fee values when you make a transaction on Lightning, so that you will always have one with a high enough fee, but will only have to use the one with the lowest fee that will also confirm.

You definitely seemed to imply that that was their job, how could they otherwise fail?
I don't know exactly what it takes to retain first mover advantage, in cryptocurrency or any other field. And I don't think anyone does. That is one aspect that is probably important, and depending on how you define it, you can fit anything in there.
One thing that I'm happy has **not** happened, is the introduction of features that have not been thoroughly researched as to whether they could harm Bitcoin in the long run, or introduce attack vectors that will be difficult to fix later. The resistance to fickle change is a strength of Bitcoin's, showing that powerful state or state sponsored actors can't coerce the network into unwanted changes down the road.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:43:18
Agree with all of this. I think Coinbase's management is a rather toxic part of this space. But there are also many others who have not implemented segwit, or updated their software to a version that has. And I think there is actually some weight to the argument that the reference client hasn't implemented it yet. The reason it has become such a big issue is, as you say, that some use it for political and market manipulation purposes, but mostly because of the huge influx of new users and capital.


And Poloniex before that :)

It's like you didn't even read my post, and only wanted to push the agenda that fees are too high, mr PM-ME-**ALTCOINS**. How shocking..
I said that the fees haven't doubled every 77-90 days if you look at the fee size in BTC, not it's equivalent dollar value. That is all that matters for the use case we were discussing.

The 10 minute block time is not *completely* arbitrary. It was chosen pretty carefully by satoshi, as a balance between speed and security. It's supposed to be fast enough, where propagation time is such a small portion of the average block time, as to put very little centralizing pressure geographically. If block times are small, then it is advantageous to be physically closer to other miners.
Your version doesn't work, as that would make the blockchain run away in size. People would not be able to verify their own transactions by running a full node, and initial blockchain download would take forever.
Smaller but more frequent blocks are also a bad idea, as that bloats the blockchain with unnecessary overhead, as every block has descriptive data that is not connected to any transaction. Transactions would not be instant anyway, so what's the point?

You *are* making Bitcoin transactions, you are just not broadcasting them on the network yet. When you want to settle the channel you will. Or if for some stupid reason, your channel partner tries to steal funds from you, then you also broadcast it, and claim all of his coins as well.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:04:41
That is a good answer.
I'm guessing there will also be fee competition related pressure in some direction.
Some actors could also make demands to keep the channel open, like using the channel, or using other services of theirs, to motivate the security costs and tying up of capital. This pressure could also go in either direction, depending on how it plays out.

I agree in general, but there is a mitigating factor in that you could be paid every day or every hour or every minute. Then if you are also paying most of your bills with a much higher frequency, there won't be those sudden jumps in liquidity in the channel(s). If you manage to save every month, then with regular intervals, you can reset your channel as you withdraw most of your coins to cold storage.
I realize this is pretty far in the future, but so is getting your paycheck in BTC for most people.
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:16:11
When you create a transaction in advance, you set the fee in BTC, not dollars. Fee size has not even come close to doubling every 77-90 days for the past year. Most of the increase in fee size is due to the increasing price of BTC.

Damnit, when will North Korea make their intentions known, that will really tip the scale!
The map is interesting, but it's not the countries that haven't taken a stance yet that are interesting from an international perspective. It's what develops in the large, influential economies.
The only way the smaller economies could have a large impact, is if the larger economies effectively prohibit its use. If the smaller countries then leverage the benefits of having an international currency, and remove the need for maintaining its own, as well as setting themselves up as first movers among countries, for a potential world currency. Then that could put pressure on larger countries to not miss the boat.

I am optimistic about Bitcoin, and think Lightning Network(s) is an interesting and useful implementation, that I think will have a lot of impact. Therefor I truly welcome objective and thorough analysis of its potential impacts and future states.
You provide that, and I think that qualifies your comments enough that developers and scientists working on LN would listen to you and discuss with you on other social media platforms, even if you created a new, pseudonymous account just to have this discussion. I encourage you to do so, and I think the earlier discussions are held about drawbacks and potential attack vectors, the better it is for the development and deployment of the technology.
Thank you for holding a discussion in a productive, civil, and objective manner.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:09:59
This is probably true, but incentives might not push them in that direction until a prolonged market downturn occurs, forcing them to focus on minimizing costs. Just look at how slow segwit adoption has been now that it makes more business sense for them to focus on scaling up other parts of their business to attract and accommodate more new users.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:11:15
But the sending address is not generated by the Trezor, only the receiving address. In this case the coins would have to be sent from an address created by Coinbase, and that address would have to be a Segwit address. It won't be, as they have not implemented segwit. They will however probably have it in an address starting with a 3.

Segwit had pros and cons, even if the pros vastly outweighed the cons. This improvement is strictly better, meaning there are definite pros and no cons.
It will be activated with a method that does not rely on miner signalling, and the miners won't oppose it anyway, because it will bring them more fees after it's been activated.

Bitcoin Core is of course always the recommended wallet, if you want to use Bitcoin to its fullest, verifying your transactions and keeping your privacy.
But maybe you don't want to wait for initial blockchain sync, let it use a lot of bandwidth, have the ~200GB harddrive space for syncing before you prune it down. Then Electrum is good, or any of the popular hardware wallets. Just remember that you have to trust the code in the wallet you run, so one that is open source and popular so that many people have reviewed it to be safe is a good idea.
You also have to trust the system you run it on, which is why hardware wallets are a safe choice. Tails is also a good choice if you know how that works, or if you have a safe computer on hand you can use that.
If it's a lot of money I would go with a hardware wallet. It it's not, then probably Electrum on the device you want to use it, computer or phone.

How do you mean, improve energy consumption?
Lightning network will probably make the price higher in the long term, because of more viable use cases. This enables more hashing power to profitably secure the network, thus causing higher energy consumption. It's the nature of secure cryptocurrency. Energy spent is a function of the value of bitcoin, the block reward, and fee volume.
For utility and price to go up from the Lightning Network, it would have to be used quite extensively. Meaning many transactions would be aggregated before they hit the blockchain. Therefor the energy consumption per transaction would probably go down. Energy consumption per volume might also go down.
Btw, don't fall for the proof of stake sales pitch. It is flawed in several ways.

It is a separation of issues. You would still be able to make channels with the punishment mechanism if you wanted to, just like you can still make non-segwit Bitcoin transactions, even though support for segwit has been introduced. It brings benefits to those who need the new functionality, and doesn't hurt those who don't. As for what those benefits are, see cdecker's response to Cryptolution.

If we manage to avoid the current centralized mining power forcing us into changing pow, is it not just a few years away that the asic development will have flattened out, and we should start to see more decentralization of mining again?
If we could reach that point, and that could be achieved, that would be an almost insurmountable advantage to bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies.
If the options are BU or change the pow, I wouldn't hesitate a second about changing pow, but I also think we should be REALLY reluctant to do so.

No, but they're still your bitcoins, that you choose to keep in the exchange's wallet. Possession is determined by law, and by law they are your coins. It might not be your wallet, but it's a wallet that you are using.
It's very stupid to keep your bitcoins in someone elses wallet longer than necessary, for all the reasons I assume you are implying.

Right now I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is both slower and more expensive than the digital alternatives in Sweden, even if you count LN. Widespread use of Bitcoin will have to be based on a push from consumers, based on the total lack of private payment options.
The tax situation for crypto is also one of the worst in the world, so changes will have to come on many fronts. I think the financial integrity of people in Sweden will suffer for quite a few years. Perhaps it could be somewhat mitigated if prepaid debit cards or similar toke hold as an alternative.

Transaction fees will always be lower in Bcash at any given number of transactions per block, given that the price is not higher than Bitcoin's (which is not going to happen). That's not the point though. The lower transaction fees can be maintained by centralizing the verification of transactions. Because the blocks and blockchain becomes huge, regular users won't have the capacity to verify the chain (and therefore transactions) themselves, it will only be done by miners and large businesses. At that point it is extremely inefficient, because you have to compare it to other centralized services instead of Bitcoin. And Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, et al. are orders of magnitude more efficient, either in number of transactions they are able to process, or the total cost of a transaction, depending on how the (very few) decision makers of Bcash chooses to configure the protocol.

It does pick private keys that add up to at least the amount you are trying to send. They also usually try to be somewhat smart about the UTXOs they select, so as to not leave dust in your wallet.
If some of it was sent to some other destination than you intended, then that would be noticed very quickly, and word would spread. But it would of course be catastrophic for the first person that was subject to such an attack, and that is why it's so important that software in this space is open source, so that the person running the program can check the code themselves if they want, and notice that there are no such hidden features, and that the community as a whole can check it and help each other not get cheated in this manner. Bugs are also more easily found, which is a very positive thing :)
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:01:02
If all your btc is aggregated in one private key, yes. But say that you bought bitcoins on an exchange, withdrew three times, then purchased a vpn subscription for example. Then each withdrawal would be stored in a different private key, but all the keys would be part of your wallet. You can view the three keys as three notes or three coins. Their value would be equal to the amount you withdrew. When you buy your subscription, if the amount you need to pay is covered buy the bitcoins in only one of your private keys, then you would only send form that one, and receive change from that to a new private key. If there was no key with a large enough bitcoin amount attached to it, the you would spend form more than one, potentially from all of them. The change would however only be sent to one key.
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:53:22
In that case they would not include any transactions, because that would be faster and easier.

It might be a true statement, but it is framed as a problem and pushed as a narrative to further their own agenda. In my view it's not a problem but a feature. The amount of energy used to verify transactions is a function of the value people put on those transactions being processed and confirmed, in terms of fees and the value of the currency.

You get paid for routing, so you have to commit funds to channels, and risk those funds in a hot wallet. That's what you get paid for, and even then you might not make up for the onchain fees of managing your channels. We don't know the future incentives and fees, but my guess is that it will be like current Bitcoin nodes, some people will run them because they use them, some because they want to help the network out, but it won't be a highly profitable business.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:34:04
It is a small amount of BTC, irregardless of the price of BTC in dollars. It isn't a fixed amount however, as it depends on how high the fees are (in BTC). It also depends on what someone considers a small amount, but it must at least be small enough that there is a risk that a large amount of it goes to fees if you spend it.

They also can't bring someone back from the dead, that doesn't give you the right to kill someone. Don't walk into the crosswalk without looking just because you're in the right. And when it comes to Bitcoin, don't keep them in a wallet where you're not in sole possession of the keys. Not because they're not your bitcoins, but because you don't want to lose them.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:37:34

But now it can be done using only bitcoin and no more trust in exchanges than you already put in them when you deposit your coins there. No need to dilute total coin supply by adding alts to the mix.

Institutional users, with stateside pressure will eventually try to influence development. At that point it is important to take a firm stand in favor of financial integrity and fungibility. Thankfully, those players don't really love KYC so much as they are forced to implement it, see Shapeshift. Their pressure will be limited by what is required of them by government agencies.

It might be a true statement, but it is framed as a problem and pushed as a narrative to further their own agenda. In my view it's not a problem but a feature. The amount of energy used to verify transactions is a function of the value people put on those transactions being processed and confirmed, in terms of fees and the value of the currency.

If you have more than one lightning network channel open, you will be able to route transactions between other actors. In practice you increase your balance on one of the channels and decrease it on another. To provide this service for the two users that don't have a direct channel open, you will require that the channel where your balance is increased is increased more than the one decreasing decreases.
This will be a low fee, as it doesn't take resources the same way mining does. It does however require you to have funded channels, which brings alternative costs, and if your only reason to have those channels open is to route payments, then you also have to recoup the transaction costs for opening and closing the channels. Since there will be many different routes that a payment can take, there will be a lot of downward pressure on the price due to competition. It will also be desirable for most routing nodes to balance their channels. This could lead to them even accepting negative fees, or at least free ones.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:49:20

Bitcoin Core is obviously best, but not not always suitable due to storage size and other reasons. Electrum is also very reliable. Iphone wallets are impossible to check if the app you're running is identical to the open source code, so that's a shame since Iphones are very secure devices otherwise. Bitcoindotcom's wallet is confusing with using the name Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash. My best advice is to just google extensively, bad things should show up if it's an established wallet.

Any bitcoin you own have probably been involved in a coinjoin at some point. How many transactions ago does it have to be to be considered dirty money? Even if they can identify it as a coinjoin, how do they know you were in control of they coins at the time of the coinjoin? If it would ever become a problem, just send it around a bit, maybe make some atomic swaps, perhaps even over different chains and back. This type of fungibility is possible to overcome unless fees are extraordinarily high.

Dust only means UTXOs with very small BTC balances. During times of high fees they are sometimes uneconomical to send. Coinbase had accrued A LOT of coins in such addresses that they could not move during the last bubble when the fees were high. They should have probably taken care of that long before then, but when the fees came down again they were able to consolidate them into fewer, larger UTXOs.

Alice has a website where you can pay bitcoins to download her songs. Some songs are very short and only cost 5,000 satoshis to download. People download 500 of those songs (and some others), paying very low fees, they all go to different private keys.
Alice is busy with other things and doesn't think about here website for a long time. Then the price of bitcoin explodes, and Alice remembers that she might have a bit of money generated from her music. Lo and behold, she has accrued a bit of money. But as the price went up, so did the activity on the blockchain, and fees increased because more people competed for the limited block space. The minimum fee to get your transaction included in a block is now 50 satoshis per byte. Alice wants to send her bitcoins to an exchange to sell them, as she is a struggling musician. But because adding one of her unspent outputs to her transaction makes the transaction 148 bytes larger, that costs 7,400 satoshis extra in fees, more than the 5,000 satoshis in the UTXO. If she also includes some larger amounts, then they can cover up the fee costs that her smaller UTXO can't cover, but what's the point, she would end up with more bitcoins on the exchange if she only sent form the addresses with a larger balance than what you have to add in fees to include them in the transaction.
Her best bet at this point is to wait and hope the fees go down, so that it is possible to send the small UTXOs without having to just pay their entire balance in fees to the miner. If she is not in a hurry, she could be patient and wait for very low fees, and send all of her bitcoins to herself, in a transaction with very low fees. If she can send them for 1sat/b, then the fee would be lower than 150 satoshis per UTXO. If she then at a later point wants to send them to an exchange, they are already aggregated to a single UTXO, and the fee would be small in relation to the amount she is sending, even if fees are a bit higher at that point.
Hope that helps!

There are many perks with using lightning network payments, but they won't be appropriate in every situation.
To name a few aspects in which they are superior to regular Bitcoin transactions. They are near instantaneous, as opposed to ~10 minutes up to several hours.
They are much cheaper. Instead of one transaction fee per transaction, you will pay two transaction fees per 1-infinity number of transactions. Since you can fund your wallet by having lightning network payments routed to you, once you have opened a few and have good, diverse connection to the network, you won't have to open or close many connections for a long time.
Transactions are much more anonymous, so your neighbors, government, local mafia won't know all the details of every payment you make. As it's pretty much only the nodes you connect to that sees the payments you make, and they also won't know if it's you payment or if you're routing it for someone else, analyzing your transaction history will be much more difficult.
@_date: 2018-10-19 12:04:36

You can never settle for a greater amount than you control.
A pretty common scenario will probably be that you want to send someone some money, say 10 mBTC. Since you're paying a transaction fee anyway (we're assuming that you're not already well integrated in the lightning network), and since you might want to send this person/company more money in the future, you open a lightning channel. You do this by sending the 10 mBTC amount, but also commit (ty up) an additional amount, say 200 mBTC in the channel. This means that you can send however many additional transactions you want to that address without settling on the blockchain more than once more.
What you can also do at this point is send bitcoins through that node, if it has other channels open than just with you. You can also receive payments up to the amount that you have sent in the past (as long as you haven't closed the channel).
If you were to open more channels with different people/companies, then your node would all of a sudden be in a position to route payments, if you would wish to. But as you can see from this, you can't route amounts larger than you have committed to your channels.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:09:19

Ok, I mistakenly assumed you were one of the mindless altcoin pumpers, that think that because security is expensive in a decentralized system, their silver bullet coin, where they got in early, has it all figured out.
I highly appreciate the kind of work that you do, and I meant it when I said figuring out a secure system with lower energy footprint would be groundbreaking. Any research getting us closer to that is much appreciated.
Unfortunately I don't have time right now to discuss this as deeply as I, and probably you, would like to. I remember reading your paper when it was published, but I don't remember the details. I remember thinking it was good, but I don't have the expertise to discuss particular technical details with you anyway, I can only discuss it in more general terms.
I haven't researched or put much thought to this in half a year, and I haven't saved links to every text that has influenced my opinion, but here are a few that are critical to Proof of Stake:
It will always be difficult to balance Nothing at Stake problems with Long Range Attack risks, as well as motivating Weak Subjectivity in a trustless system. But even if everything is set up perfectly, and everybody understands and accepts that, that still hands power over from users to holders, which breaks the dynamic power triangle of miners, users, and holders. Moving power from users to holders would bring the incentive structure closer to our current fiat system, and it would make the system more rigid and brittle, and subject to tyranny from those with means.
This is in respect to pure PoS systems. Incorporating PoS in a PoW system could potentially be done while trying to minimize the downsides and maximizing the upsides of PoS. But it doesn't make any intuitive sense to me, how a certain percentage lowering of power spending on PoW due to the PoS component, wouldn't also bring about an about equal amount of the negative aspects of PoS.
Whether a certain trade-off is worth it or not, is up to each and everyone to decide for themselves, but that is what altcoins are for. Unless a clean solution is presented, with obvious benefits and small enough drawbacks, that a consensus can be reached to hard fork Bitcoin. That is the magnitude of invention that I mean when I say groundbreaking discovery, and if it is a pure PoS system, then I consider it an invention as big as Bitcoin itself.

That's a fair point, and something to keep in mind. Mostly though, those statements should be judged on their merits. Just like they should have been judged on their merits back when they were first said.
I don't know how widely held those opinions were at that time, maybe it was very important to people, and maybe they didn't really care, since that was far in the future, and at that time there were no costs associated with transactions anyway.
Either way, it was and is naïve to assume that transactions can be free, when they are competing for limited space, that will be broadcast and stored forever, on thousands of computers. It could be done for ideological reasons i suppose, but it would serve little purpose. When the cost goes towards zero, the demand goes towards infinity. This would lead to the mempool being completely spammed with zero cost transactions, and the utility of any of those transactions would go towards zero.

The lowest efficiency miners drop. Price depends on a lot more than hashing power security, so hash power drops will not collapse the price.
If you think the system is completely flawed, then you shouldn't invest in cryptocurrencies. There is no Proof of Stake system that is even theoretically secure and has the right incentives, let alone a functional proof of concept. If someone solves that problem, that's as big of a breakthrough as Bitcoin was.

And you don't think there will be a positive correlation between number of transactions on the Lightning Network and the number of on chain transactions for opening and closing channels?

I know, I really like the concept and I hope it will work well in practice. But once the transaction starts spreading, it will have to start spreading the same way as a non dandelion transaction. Maybe you, as the originator, don't have to send to as many peers, but someone will. And in exchange, you will have to be the one that starts spreading others' transactions once in a while.
Maybe we are just talking about different things, but the way I see it Dandelion would introduce a small percentage extra sends to the total network.

You deposited bitcoins, or bought bitcoins. You have the option to withdraw bitcoins at any time.
If someone makes a fork, especially a malicious or irresponsible one, then you should not rely on an exchange to put a lot of money into developing support for it. Just cash out your bitcoins ahead of the fork and redeposit them again after, if you want to be sure that you can split your coins.
I could make a fork tomorrow, would you demand that every single exchange and wallet provider develop support for it? Do you expect them to charge extra fees, to set aside a budget for developing support for forks?
Fork away if you want, no one is stopping you. But don't expect or demand the ecosystem to support your shitcoin.

The reward for finding a block (verifying and ordering transactions) is currently 12.5 bitcoins, not 1. This reward will be halved every fourth year, until the year 2140. What the miners also get for finding a block are all the fees that people include in their transactions. As the mining reward gets lower, over the years, the fees will make up a larger and larger part of the income miners get from finding a block. By the year 2140, all of their income will be derived from transaction fees.

This is a VERY good list. Almost so that i would have wished you kept it to yourself :).
On the other hand, it could be a good list to be able to tick off, to inform people that this was to be expected, and we just need to keep working and not panic.
As to what I think we need to withstand all of the attack above. I believe we need to have secure and privacy focused wallet solutions, easily accessible.
We need to build support in the third world, to gain a safe haven in case the big brother nations of the western world decide to ban it or make it completely impractical to use, from a tax perspective.
We need to build global support for the right to financial sovereignty. When every financial transaction you can do is digital and through centralized channels, then if you are an enemy of the powerful, you can be marginalized to the point of living on the street. It should be the will of the people to be in control of their own money, and the powerful will try to stop us.
We need to constantly explain and teach to people who are interested, what the fundamental raison d'ètres of Bitcoin are. That bitcoins are limited, and can't be arbitrarily deflated in value to force you to spend your money. That decentralization is the key to remain in control, and not be censored. There are a lot of new people getting interested every day, they can't be assumed to know everything from day one. I at least, prefer it if they have things explained to them by someone who has been around a while. Instead of trying to figure it out on their own, and drowning in uninformed opinions, FUD and propaganda.
Big hodlers should liquidate some of their BTC in price rallies. To have cash on hand to mitigate hash power attacks from altcoins during price dumps. Picking up some cheap coins as a bonus :). On the same note, keeping a decent amount of forked coins still on hand for a while after a fork, to be able to dump as a mitigation to price manipulation attempts. Cheap coins as a bonus here as well :). These strategies might lose slightly on average, but they are less volatile, and they could heighten the chance that BTC succeeds. And most people that still have a lot of bitcoins have faith and belief in the idea and vision of Bitcoin, and are not in it only for the cash. They are also already incredibly rich, no matter what happens.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:29:06

No they don't. For some time, many of the most prolific contributors were employed by Blockstream, now another company employs more top contributors. It doesn't really matter, as there are over a hundred contributors, and they follow a strict, scientific approach to development.


Censorship resistant means that no one can decide if your transaction is accepted or not. Like if the government in your country decided to freeze your bank account because they thought you were a threat to their power. Decentralization is one of the key features to prevent that.


Conducting a safe hard fork is much more difficult than the people trying to spread FUD want to admit. Pretty much everyone is in consensus about the need for a hard fork to larger block sizes, but since it's such a large task, it should be done right, so we don't have to do it again unnecessarily. Thankfully, we were able to soft fork to double the size, using segwit. That should be enough for some time. Before it would be a problem, the lightning network and other second layer solutions will hopefully have relieved enough of the onchain transaction pressure, to give us the time we need to do a properly researched hard fork, with a solution that can work for a long time.

In this context, a fork is when some miners start mining blocks that follow different rules than the chain it is forking from. In the case of Bitcoin Cash, they allow blocks that are up to 8mb, whereas Bitcoin only allow blocks that are 1mb. Since one or more requirements are more lax on the new chain (blocks are allowed to be larger than on the original chain), their blocks will not be accepted by Bitcoin nodes, which is why they fork into a different chain. If the rules would instead have been stricter, for example only allowing blocks that are up to 0.5mb, then their blocks would be accepted by Bitcoin nodes. As long as no miners mine blocks that are larger than 0.5mb, then this would be a softfork instead of a hardfork, meaning that existing clients would still be compatible with the new clients, and two different forks wouldn't be created. This is the kind of fork that segwit was, which you might have heard of. The rules that blocks and transactions follows did not conflict with older clients, so as long as miners followed the new rules, there would be no fork.

If it's a productive change, it then goes through a long process of peer review and testing, and if it is deemed safe, well implemented, and a net positive, it is merged into the next version by someone with commit access. It doesn't matter too much who it is that does the actual legwork with merging it into the code, as the result can be inspected by anyone, and if they don't adhere to the scientific process, meaning they don't add things that should be added, or they are too hasty in adding or maliciously adds something bad, then their ability to commit will be revoked. If someone would abuse this power there would be a HUGE outcry in the community.


A node means that you yourself keep a copy of the blockchain, so that you can verify transactions without having to rely on a third party. To participate in the network, you also serve the blocks to other nodes, so that everybody can have access to the newest blocks from as many separate nodes as possible. If blocks are too large then the hardware and especially bandwidth requirements of running a full node goes up, meaning that many people will no longer be able to verify their own transaction, which is the main value Bitcoin brings over the existing monetary system.


Bitcoin Cash is not a hard fork update, where the operation of the currency is supposed to continue uninterrupted, while new features are added and properties are changed. It is a fork to an altcoin, which has been done many, many times before. Almost no one is actually running a Bitcoin Cash full node. Some big exchanges and wallet providers do, because they are very much incentivized to do so. But to avoid problems during an actual hard fork upgrade, every single node, and there are at least a hundred thousand of them, would need to be upgraded. And nothing can be allowed to go wrong. So you see, it's not the same thing.

There are a lot more things wrong with that agreement than no devs being involved..


Segwit was a soft fork, and happened later than that.


That was just a minor reason. The main reasons were that a hard fork on such short notice would have been extremely risky, it would have moved Bitcoin from being an open source project to a corporate one, it wouldn't have solved the scaling problems, it would have caused centralization of nodes, and it was an obvious attack on the network.

The app can't show both balances, or even know if a certain balance is in BTC or S2X, simply because it's an SPV client, a light client. It doesn't validate the rules, and S2x doesn't come with replay protection, so it has no way to distinguish between the chains. It will believe the node it is connected to, about which is the longest chain. What the consensus rules of that chain are, is decided by the node.
You might also want them to implement a splitting tool as soon as possible. That would be nice, and as a user that could be a desirable feature. But I can also sympathize with the wallet providers, when they delay implementing it until the need is more clear. It takes time to implement it, and anyone can propose a fork at any time. Should they just spend all of their time creating splitting tools for every potential fork that users would like to get access to?
It's a good signal to send, I think, that you can't just create a fork at a whim, and expect it to get broad wallet support. Especially when you launch it maliciously and adversarially, without replay protection, as S2X does.
In the end I think it's up to the wallet provider to make their decision on what and when to do something about a fork, based on how much it would cost them to implement, how likely they think it is that they will have to implement it, and how many users they will lose by delaying the implementation. The important thing is that they are open with their intentions, and that they communicate it to their users in a manner that will let them make an informed decision about where they want to store their coins.

True, it might not be an efficient node, but I think it (or some other, similar approach) will be an important type of setup for a subgroup of people. Namely those who want to participate in making lightning transactions and can't/doesn't prioritize running a node, but still doesn't want to give up privacy by handing over public keys to monitoring parties. I think that's an important use case/user group to support, to enable widespread adoption.
Good talk. I really want the lightning network to get as much adoption as possible. And as such, I think we need to acknowledge all the possible difficulties as early as possible, so that we can figure out how to mitigate them.

There you go again with the altcoin pumping.
The fees have been varying yes, as they always are. It's been a bit worse around the times of Bcashs disruptive EDAs, but you could still get away with fees of $0.5-1 within a decent time frame. And now as segwit is getting more adoption, the mempool should have been pretty much cleared out if it weren't for the spam attacks and last EDA pump'n'dump push of Bcash.

I agree that that would be sufficient to maintain a channel, without it being stolen from. But then it's no more than a payment channel, which is something that has been possible for quite some time already, and hasn't been used much, because it hasn't been worth the effort.
It would be more useful than a regular payment channel if your counterparty is always online, however. Then you can send bitcoins to others, routing through them. They couldn't do the same through you, unless you were online, your wallet would need to sign new transactions to rebalance the channels (route the payment).
To really participate in the lightning network, and be a part of making the it stronger and more useful, you would have to have a node online, that could route other people's payments. Much like how full nodes today contribute by relaying transactions and distributing the network. As opposed to spv clients, that use the network but only contribute indirectly, by paying fees that incentivizes larger hash power to secure the network.
I can see the lightning network developing in the same direction. Some people running constantly online nodes, that route payments and provide liquidity, and many people using mostly offline wallets, or outsourced monitoring. They will contribute by paying the online nodes routing fees for maintaining the network. The size of those fees will be discovered by market making, that will be completely different from the fee market for onchain payments, and will probably be quite chaotic in the beginning. The only thing that seems sure is that it will be much cheaper than onchain fees.

This is a completely unfair comparison.
How many nodes needed to be updated with that release, and how many customized nodes were based off their original client? Hint, almost no one except a few exchanges and mining pools are using it. It is also a very new coin, as opposed to BTC, making all of the users much more on their toes with regards to changes in the protocol.

Dust being unspendable is definitely a problem down the line. You're right in that lower fees would make some outputs spendable, that weren't before. There will always be dust transactions though, because of how divisible bitcoins are. In the end, the entire network will be secured by the fees (not mining rewards), and then the most important factor for the size of that security, is the price of a bitcoin. Bigger blocks would spread the fees out over more transactions, but that only helps if the system stays decentralized, thus giving it value.
It is also important to note that this article was written in response to an article by Erik Vorhees, as a defence of the then not yet accepted soft fork for segwit. The quote about about fees for transactions with many inputs is taken out of context. What it really tries to say, is that with segwit, as compared to no segwit, transactions with many inputs would be cheaper when you don't have to pay as much for the witness part of the additional inputs, thereby not bloating the UTXO set as much.
First of all, "Core" doesn't hold complete control, and secondly, only benefits from small blocks together with the rest of us, because it keeps Bitcoin decentralized. "Core" is just the Bitcoin client, but what people in rbtc often mean with the word are the developers contributing to that open source project. There are over a hundred of them, in a diverse, scientific community. The "other side", meaning Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Cash, Segwit2X (they are all the same people), are a few disgruntled ex developers and some hired goons, together with a few CEO's that see their business model threatened by the community's resolve for keeping decentralization, sprinkled with some rotten eggs, like Roger Ver and Jihan Wu.
The only thing that really makes Bitcoin different than the existing banking and financial transaction system, is that it is censorship resistant. It is that way because it is decentralized so that it cannot be shut down by pinpointing a few select points of failure, and putting the clamps on them. That's because it's peer to peer, and you verify transactions you receive yourself, and don't rely on some other entity to tell you if the transaction you received is correct or not. If running a node gets too expensive for most users to run, then they have to rely on third parties to verify transactions for them, like Coinbase, or Bitpay, or Blockchain.info. They then get power to force through even more centralizing pressure, strengthening their position until they are irreplaceable. What happens then when some powerful states come knocking, and demand a fork to redistribute all coins from a revolutionary party's wallets? Or that all fungibility features be removed? Or that the mining reward schedule be extended forever, to "stimulate growth", aka building a bubble during their rule so they get elected again? We would have completely lost our censorship resistant money. It's only when you at least have the option of verifying your own transactions, that the system is resistant to corruption.

Hashrate generally follows price. This noticing you have done, can you present it with data? My guess would be that you are just noticing what looks like a pattern, based on way too little data.
It's not impossible that miners have better insight into future price development than the market, or that a large part of the price is based on the security of the network, meaning higher hashrate in this case. Any such causality seems far fetched to me, but if you can back it up with data, then we could start digging into it.

Very good explanations. Just to be clear though, blocks would generally be bigger if they included confidential transactions (at least as the research stands now), but the 1mb blocksize limit wouldn't have to be hard forked away to enable those larger blocks (just as with segwit).

Right, but it's going to be cheap. My computer is going to be on anyway, there's not that much extra electricity in relaying some transactions. I could charge something little if my channels get more unbalanced, as that would require me to balance them on chain more often. But on the flip side, I could even pay you to route through me if it helps rebalance my channels.
As for the capital required, what I will have committed to my node will also be the capital I have available for use on the lightning network.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:15:05
I haven't kept up with the protocol, so I could be totally off base here.
It should be possible to make transactions that depend on each other, meaning that if I have to send you my total transaction in two different payments, then you can only claim the bitcoins in one of them if you have also received the other one. I could be wrong, and that would mean that it might be too risky to send it like that, because there's a risk that one of the payments fails, and then you have irrevocably sent the other transaction.
Even if the functionality is possible, I would presume that it has been pushed to a later milestone, so as to be able to release a first version as soon as possible. It doesn't seem like a critical feature for a usable lightning network. Useful yes, critical no.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:18:01
Activated means that the new transaction format is supported, not that every wallet and service has implemented support for it.
Many have already implemented it, which is great, because it frees up space on the blockchain, and it can reduce fees for both users and businesses. Some have prioritized differently, and not finished implementing it yet. It's difficult to say if those decisions are right or not from a business perspective, without having full insight into their inner workings, but we should let them know, that we would appreciate it if they got around to it sooner rather than later. On the other hand, I prefer that it takes longer, if that is what it takes for them to get it right.

Some good points. The hot wallet part is the most worrying, and it's one of the reasons it's not supposed to be used for large sums.
Coins being locked up in other people's transactions points to some sort of misunderstanding on your part, I can't really understand how. But that's not how it works.
You will be able to outsource the monitoring of your channels, for a small fee and/or part of the reward for catching transgressions. But that requires giving them your public keys.
However I don't see a way to manage channels or route payments without having your wallet/node online, with access to the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:07:54
The transactions on the lightning network will be virtually transaction cost free, but the blockchain transactions for funding and closing the channels will still have fees. Because you would need much fewer of those transactions compared to the transactions they enable you to make as lightning transactions (which are also blockchain transactions, you just don't publish them unless the other party misbehaves), the average transaction fee will be much lower.

I too have had the fear that most people with Bitcoin investments have too shallow of an understanding of it. Then, on the other hand, the ones with the deep pockets, and larger influence should, and probably do, have a greater understanding.
This might also be too little. But I have come to the conclusion that that doesn't matter. It is that ones that truely and deeply understand as many of these subjects as possible, and how they relate to Bitcoin, that have the vision about the future that enables them to buy instead of sell in difficult times, hold instead of sell in bubbles, and to constantly build on the network that they believe will have a huge impact in changing the world for the better.

The halvening has much more of an effect when speculation and confidence is low. At that time, most buy and sell orders are based on transactions for goods and services. Buyers buying bitcoins to be able to pay someone else. That someone else selling those bitcoins after the trade has taken place. For the price to be stable, the influx of new money must match the selling pressure from miners, which is their cost of operation. In that case, if the market hasn't already factored it into the price (which they haven't on the previous two halvenings), then the supply diminishes while the demand doesn't. This in turn should steadily push the price upwards, until a new equilibrium is found. Unless, once again, the market doesn't anticipate this, and corrects upwards ahead of time. Which has actually happened, there is a lot of psychology involved.
When confidence is high, on the other hand, then speculation is more prevalent, early adopters liquidate more of their holdings, and trading volume is higher. This all means that mining rewards being dumped to the market, accounts for a much smaller portion of the total sell pressure. This should, theoretically, mean that the halvening should have a much smaller, immediate effect on price, even if the long term effect stays the same. But, as in the previous scenario, there is psychology and regular market dynamics at play.

Because altcoins are worthless and will lose their value, Bitcoin is a defense against deflating fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:53:10
What many people might not realize with this perspective, is that if it is accompanied with a prudently engineered,  gradual increase of the block size, in step with hardware and bandwidth development, then the fee per transaction won't need to be exceptionally high, as many of the congesting, low value transactions will be aggregated and amortized on higher layers. This is completely in line with how most people see the best path forward to be. This could perhaps be coupled with some flexibility on the cap, where temporary congestions could be alleviated by higher fees buying some extra block size.
@_date: 2019-12-14 22:41:09
Well, while the fees are low, it can't really hurt :). But I don't think it accomplishes as much as you think it does. Coin control is important from a privacy perspective, but mixing outputs with yourself doesn't do much more than connect all of those outputs to one entity; you. 
Not to mention that it takes quite some time and effort. I'm happy that you, and others, take privacy and fungibility seriously, but if I were you, I would seriously look into Joinmarket or Wasabi for creating onchain anonymity.

Light weight nodes have one extra step compared to full nodes, they have to send the transaction to a server before it gets propagated in the peer-to-peer network, before it eventually reaches the miner that will include it in a block.
But that extra step is pretty much negligible in terms of time it takes to be included in a block. The entire propagation time is also quite negligible. What makes up pretty much the entire waiting time to get your transaction included in the blockchain, is the on average 10 minutes per block that it takes miners to produce new blocks where they can include transaction.
The only thing you can do to speed the process up is to make sure that your fee is high enough that miners make sure that they include it in the next block they find. But on the other hand, you don't gain any time by paying much more than necessary either, just provide enough buffer so that you don't get outbid before the next block is found.
But running a full node ensures that your transaction has actually been included in the blockchain. If you don't verify the blocks yourself, you can never truly know that the transactions have confirmed, you have to trust someone else. You will also have to tell them which transactions you are interested in, giving up privacy in the process.

That's not really how it works. If you want to micro manage it (you have to find it fun, and know what you're doing), then you can look through your unspent outputs, and see if you can piece together a transaction that is close enough to the amount you want to send, without using an extra input, or cutting one up unnecessarily.
I don't see that this would be relevant very often, because usually you want to send a specific amount, not circa $10.

Why not have RBF instead of CPFP, and exchange multiple closing transactions with different fees? It's at best a slight improvement, but am I missing something that would make it worse? This means you could also try the closing transaction with the lowest fee first, and if it seems not to confirm, then bump it to a more probable one, and if the fees unexpectedly explodes, then you can still bomb it with a really large fee.

First of all, I don't really trust Xapo, they have had highly questionable judgement in the past. Secondly, even if the numbers are correct, it's still a matter of definition of what 'using' Bitcoin is. If you just buy them on an exchange, never use them to send to someone else or pay for anything, or even withdraw them to your own wallet, then I would argue that you're not really a user. It's more akin to having bought stocks in companies selling dial-up modems, but never using the Internet yourself.

If people stop using it because fees are high, then there will be no activity on the network and fees will be low again, leading people to use it again. What the fees do is price out transactions with lower utility. Drawing the line for what is the right utility to allow is subjective and arbitrary, but drawing the line based on technical factors influencing the security of the network is at least decently scientific.

RBF and automated fee bumps is a scheme I have been meaning to implement and promote for over a year and a half. Haven't had time unfortunately.

If that get's implemented in wallets, it would make my user experience a lot better at least.

Market cap doesn't exist in cryptocurrencies, and using it in the context many people are using it, including this post, is misleading.
To give a simple example; say that I create my own new "great" coin called LargerThanBitcoin. It has 1,000,000,000,000,000 units and I won all of them. I pay an exchange a handsome amount to integrate and list it, and then I sell on unit of it to my friend for $10. LargerThanBitcoin now has a $10,000,000,000,000,000 "market cap", and is much larger than Bitcoin.
This scenario seems far fetched, but is more or less true for every cryptocurrency. Bitcoin by far is the least like this, but has some elements of it as well.

If the block are huge (which wouldn't work for other reasons), they wouldn't have to fill the blocks to ruin the system. They would just have to make them large enough to make the blockchain too large to store and sync, propagation to take forever, and mining to centralize to a single actor.

It's not really related to that. What it does is that it enables you to send one larger transaction using multiple channels, that individually have insufficient funds but put together have enough.
Another set of functionalities that people will be working on going forward, is the atomic swap functionality with other blockchains, that you're talking about. I don't know if that includes "going back and forth between multiple alts and bitcoin at the same time". What does that even mean? Could you explain a use case where you would want to do that?

@_date: 2018-11-24 13:00:38
Exactly. So you could say that it has its own supply, which varies a lot over time but is always equal to the number of bitcoins that are locked up in pegs. The rbtc that gets awarded for locking up bitcoins can be sent to an rbtc address that you control. You are now the one that can claim the number of bitcoins that were locked up to receive those rbtc.
All of this hinges on trust in the entity that manages and controls the peg. If they verify transactions and unpeggings correctly, then the sidechain functions very well. If they don't, then they could potentially steal all the pegged bitcoins. Their compliance with the rules of the sidechain can at least be verified by however wants to run a node.

Just wanted expand on this. Most sites wait 3 to 6 confirmations, regardless of whether it's Bitcoin or Litecoin. But that is not very logical, as most of the security provided by extra confirmations is due to the extra hashing power necessary to produce those blocks. There are 4 Litecoin blocks for every Bitcoin block, and the total hashing power of the Bitcoin network is vastly bigger than that of the Litecoin network. Even 24 Litecoin confirmations wouldn't even come close to the same security as provided by 6 Bitcoin confirmations.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:48:16
It could be that it's more secure, but I still have no way of knowing what the code inside the secure element is doing. There is an issue of security through obscurity, as well as having to place extra trust in the manufacturer.
I also don't appreciate the downplaying of security risks with devices that cumulatively probably protect many millions of dollars in value. It hints at prioritizing brand and profits above security. This attitude has led to Saleem foregoing his bug bounty, and could lead to him and other white hat hackers spending less time on their products, which is long term very bad for their security.

Not the most scientific approach, but well thought out and discussion inducing take on the future of Lightning Network. The incentive model of the system, and the solutions it will result in as a consequence of that, is as important as the technical solutions to its various problems.

I think the question is rather whether the amount and quality of work related to Bitcoin is greater than all the work on other coins combined. It's also not a very interesting question, because even if there was more work done on other coins, it would mostly be paid work done on scam coins, and once the money grab is done, or failed, the work will stop, but Bitcoin will continue to move ahead at an ever increasing pace.

This is very nice, I appreciate that they invest resources into this. However, it won't actually make much difference unless they give discounts for cryptocurrency payments. There are benefits for the company receiving the payment (quick finalization, no charge backs), but the customer bears the cost of the transaction.
The discount can't be in relation to the transaction cost, but to the alternative payment options. If the company thinks the benefits are high enough, and the customer thinks the discount is high enough, then they can meet at a price where the best payment option is Bitcoin. Otherwise, the purchases will be few and far between, and mostly made by early adopters with large stacks that they want to trim.
With many company starting to accept cryptocurrency payments, at least a few of them will look back at it and see the benefits of the purchases that were actually made, instead of looking at it as a failure due to the low volume.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:53:33
Pretty much the entire argument is based on the assumption that open source software and firmware is less secure than closed source code in a secure enclave.
Both approaches have benefits and drawbacks, but assuming that people invested in cryptocurrencies would just accept as truth that trusting a third party is more secure than open source solutions is a bit naïve, and makes me suspect that this is an advert.

That depends on the trading volume, but "market cap" is a pretty good predictor of volume. You're right that many use cases are negatively affected by slippage and volatility. If for some unfathomable reason bitcoin would be worth that little, then it would not be used for handling such large sums. It would mostly deal with smaller transactions, like personal use drug purchases for instance. If that volume became large enough, and the average holding time was not too short, that would create a constant demand pressure that would push the price higher. If that enabled use cases that were difficult before, additional demand pressure would push price even higher. Eventually you reach an equilibrium where no new use cases are unlocked. Technical and infrastructure advancements, as well as changing real world conditions could eventually propel it further, but that is another matter.
In reality there are a lot more going on, like people investing in anticipation of future potential use cases, and mania resulting in bubbles of price and infrastructure investments, but that is the general underlying value. Note that there are use cases that are not illegal as well, but that was where the discussion started.

I don't think you get it. We should strive for it, but friction will always be lower in centralized systems, and some people will deem the risks low enough to warrant the cost savings. Speculative trading is done on such thin margins that to be successful you will have to take that risk to be competitive.

Kickstarters are stupid in almost every project where an ICO has been launched. It's not an investment vehicle, it's a charity.
Smart contracts are pretty much the point of ICO's, and is what can bring value from them. But they also bring complexity, which can trick people into investing in something different than they think they are investing in.

They can be perceived to have slightly different value, due to having different properties. For examples if fees are high on the Bitcoin main chain, then you can trade bitcoins that you already have on an exchange for rbtc, and send it somewhere cheaply, that would make rbtc more expensive. Or there could be a perceived risk that the company behind it will not honor the peg, which would make rbtc more cheap. But the peg will always keep the price in check, and it won't deviate too much from a one to one price.

You can't have a secure enclave and also have your code open source. The whole point of open source is that you can verify the code you're running. It's impossible to inspect the code inside the secure enclave, so even if the code is open source, you have no way of verifying that that is the code that you're actually running.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:09:24
It doesn't really work like that. Every form of payment has costs attached to them, both for the paying party and the receiving party. For the paying party it can be fees for having accounts and credit cards at your bank, or withdrawal fees from ATMs, and the like. For Bitcoin it can be conversion costs and spread, wire transfer fees, and UTXO consolidation transaction fees.
But let's ignore the payer's costs for now, because there can be other reasons that they have this payment option, which means that they don't view them as costs for this particular purchase.
Credit cards and debit cards have different costs in different countries, and they definitely have different costs for different market actors. Large corporations can negotiate much better terms with Visa and Mastercard, for example. But for cash to be a better alternative, you still have to account for all the cash handling and the risk of theft and robbery.
In many cases it's also not a simple question of only accepting the most profitable means of payment, because some customers prefer one form over another, regardless of what you would prefer they pay in, resulting in loss of trade if you don't supply their preferred means of payment.
On the surface, accepting bitcoins as payment should be a good deal for merchants, as there is no risk of charge backs. But there is a large initial cost of implementing a new payment option, and then there are overhead costs of maintaining it. Therefore, you have to expect significant volume to consider implementing it, and actually have at least decent volume to maintain it once it's been implemented.
Many have done this in a "subsidized" way, by using it as a marketing tool, and by externalizing the receiving party's transaction cost on the payer. Bitcoin as a means of payment has a bit of a problem getting started, as you need users for companies to accept it as payment, but you also need use cases for people to start using it. With that in mind, any use case is better than it not existing, as it may at least attract those for which it is extra appealing, despite having to eat the receiving party's costs. It could be one of the things that gets the ball rolling. For it to grow larger it will have to move away from this model eventually. When there is large enough demand from customers to be able to pay in Bitcoin, and merchants are more appreciative of the benefits of receiving immutable transactions instantly, then I think we will start to see a rather fast shift towards more Bitcoin payments. This will bring larger trading volumes as well, which will lower both conversion costs and spread. There will also be better solutions for accounting and point of sale systems, and companies handling all or parts of the transaction supply chain. These are some of the many network effects that have grown the Bitcoin use and price exponentially for many years.
Regular Bitcoin transactions have had many years to try to break into the market of everyday purchases, with very limited success. Lightning network will add significant complexity to the system, and will have some growing pains, but will eventually bring such significant benefits to transaction speed and cost, that it will be what causes an exponential breakthrough of usage, in my opinion.

You are somewhat correct in regards to the total amount of funds in the routing nodes wallet. Actually it's constantly "0", except for the small fee it will collect for routing. It will however shift the balances of the channels it has open with A and B. After the transaction is complete it will have more funds than it started with in its channel with A, and less than it started with in its channel with B. If payments are going back and forth in equal amounts in both directions, then they will never have to be closed unless one of the parties wants to unlock the coins. If the payments are unbalanced in one direction, then channels would eventually have to be topped up or closed and reopened. It will be somewhat mitigated by rebalancing functionality, where nodes send transactions in a "circle", and by giving transactions in the "wrong" direction a higher fee and transactions in the "right" direction a lower or even negative fee.

From your first post it sounds like you're thinking about this more in the sense of regular Bitcoin wallets. Sending from your cold storage to your hot wallet as you need to use it.
A version of that could be used for lightning wallets. You could have a very secure setup for your online node. It would have to have liquidity in different channels to be able to route your transactions to the destinations you want, but at least you could put it on a dedicated linux machine. You could then have your actual spending wallet disconnected when you're not using it and/or use two factor authentication, and route all transactions through the online node.

To put it plainly, SegWit **was** happening. The question was if there would also (temporarily) be another network, where the new rules were not followed. The miners got rightfully scared that the users wouldn't want to pay as much for the coins mined on the unupdated chain, and that a broken network would hurt the value of future earnings of their hardware. To save face and to retain some narrative of having more power than they do, they joined (or co-created) the Segwit2X agreement.
Users control the rules and features of this open source network. It has always been that way, and it was proven once again in the activation of segwit.

You're right, it's impossible to measure :). But you can do your best. Which I think is what you should do when you intend to hard fork. The prudent thing to do if your intention is to hard fork without causing a chain split, is to ensure as well as you can, that almost all hash power and economic interest will follow your fork. Even then you can't be sure, so always enable replay protection.
In the current situation, where it is pretty obvious, by many non-conclusive measures, that there is not consensus, the only prudent thing to do is to either not fork or fork without pretending that you will be Bitcoin after the fork. In either case, proper replay protection is in order.

It will be abandoned if it's too captured by industry, AND that industry centralizes and censors it. It's definitely not an easy thing to do, but if there were ever powerful enough actors in that much control they might try it. Just look at what some of the institutional actors in the space tried to do with Segwit2X, for control and short term gains. It's very much in the deck for some actors, and next time they could be smarter, more powerful, and the opposition could be weaker.
The landscape will look very different when it's tried next, but it will be tried in some fashion sooner or later, and if they were to ever succeed, then Bitcoin would be abandoned. Another decentralized alternative might pop up in its stead, but who knows.

Coinbase are, so far, still commited to fraudulently claim that B2X will be Bitcoin, after a potential fork in november. It would be nice if people could boycott them until they change their position, as that would put a little more pressure on them, to maybe do the right thing and back out.
On the other hand, the transaction fees they get from your one time buy, is not going to affect their bottom line much at all. So it's up to you how much of a statement you want to make, or just go with the alternative you have already researched.
The important thing is that you don't keep your bitcoins on the exchange, no matter which one you end up buying from. First of all you don't own bitcoins that are on an exchange. The exchange owns them, and you have an IOU iwth the exchange for you bitcoins. Secondly, it gives them power to influence protocol decisions on your behalf. They have control of your bitcoins, and can to a certain extent, use the weight of their holdings and transaction volume to influence decisions and economic pressures. Thirdly, they could really screw you over in the event of a split. They could either claim that only one chain is valid, and not give you access to the coins on the other chain, or they could delay that access for a long time, until its price has plummeted to nothing.
Point two and three are especially important when dealing with an exchange such as Coinbase, that have malicious intents regarding B2X.

That would help a little bit, but not much. You would still have to have liquidity in your other channels on the hot wallet to be able to send out from it to any other wallet than your own. If you instead had your hot wallet turned off most of the time, then that would drain a lot of the liquidity of the network if everybody did it, and your channel partners would not be very happy to keep channels open with you.

Yes, but it should be a matter of deliberate choice. Once you have decided that selling a certain amount is the best decision for you at that time, it's just a matter of less than an hour from that point until you have managed to transfer and sell your coins.
In regards to fees, if we are talking about an amount of coins where the transaction fee of removing them from the exchange exceeds full percentages, then leaving them on the exchange could be the better choice.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:34:43
I wholeheartedly agree that you shouldn't keep your coins on an exchange. But that is to avoid the third party custodian issues related to not owning your private keys. Being in control of your own assets protects you from being censored and from losing your funds due to some other party's incompetence or maliciousness. The wisdom of this has been proven time and time again in the Bitcoin space.
Not making financial decisions based on emotion is a matter of impulse control. If you don't learn to control your impulses, you will give in to them eventually. If your protection from those impulses is a technical one and not an emotional one, then when your impulse is strong enough to overcome the technical barrier, your response will be stronger and come with worse timing than if you had let it slowly seep out.

You use a lot of exclamation marks.
He is right that ICO's can't be stopped, because they're done based on decentralized assets. What I don't think you're getting, is that evaluating the credibility of an ICO is extremely complex and risky. After one or two great shakeouts, there will be regulatory bodies, where ICO's can register, and gain credibility by abiding by regulations and controls, that ensure they are not just scamming their investors.
This will be a good thing for most investors, as they don't have neither the know-how nor insight to make educated investments. No one is going to force people to invest in those, but they will be a safer option for the uninitiated investor. There will still be nonregulated alternatives, as that is impossible to stop, and some people that shouldn't invest in them will still do that and get ripped off. But the regulations will enable many of the benefits of ICO's, while decreasing the risk of scammers praying on casual investors.
TL;DR Regulations will not force regulation on any single ICO, but it will provide safer alternatives for those that want it.

Exchanges that won't try to steal your bitcoins are obviously better.

Lightning network channels are not loans. They are funds that you, and you alone control, that are commited to a channel. If a bank can loan you bitcoins, against some collateral, say your house, then they will need to actually send you the BTC. Meaning, that they will actually have to have the BTC in the first place.
If they send them to you in the form of a lightning channel, then you can settle that channel whenever you want, and be in possession of the coins. If they demand that you don't close the channel, and route all your transactions through them, then you just go to another bank instead, where they don't have those ridiculous demands.

The failure or success of the fork depends quite a bit on the stance they take though.
The problem is that none of the companies that could put a stop to it with a single statement want to be the one to actually do it. They want one of the other signees to do it, or start it. Then it will be easy for them to say that it's doomed, and not take too much blame for withdrawing from the agreement.
The longer it goes though, the more pressure there will be on them to withdraw. It's a bit of a chicken race, and the one with the most to lose will be the one to cave first.

Loaded wanted to do an atomic swap, and not rely on third parties or someones word. There was no known technique for that at the time. There is now though, so if that trade would have been made today it would have probably gone through.

Agreed that it shouldn't be changed in reaction to miner whim. I don't like fees more than the next guy. No fees at all would have been perfect (but impossible in practice).
I don't think the block size should be subject to influence from the fees. It should be decided based on technical circumstances. If it can't be bigger than a certain size because that risks losing decentralization, then what is the point of Bitcoin anyway?
The purpose of Bitcoin is so that you can be in control of your own wealth, and transact freely, without relying on intermediaries or governments. The bigger the blocks are, the more people can transact. Therefor, the blocks should be as big as possible, to enable as many people as possible to transact as much as possible. This should however NOT be done at the cost of the very aspects that enable Bitcoin to be independent and decentralized, regardless of if the fees rise. Rising fees not desirable, but they do demonstate the value people put in a protocol of decentralized money.

I'm a bit curious about the situation that got you into this mess. You say that you had to send it to someone in a hurry, and didn't take the time to research your alternatives. You are not alone in that, but you were very unlucky that it cost you so much.
You also say that the money represents decades worth of savings for you. This is were it doesn't add up for me. If I were to handle that large amount of money to me, then I would try to have as good of an understanding of what I was doing as possible.

Not really, at the moment. The network has to be robust, so that parts of it can't be separated from the rest, if Internet traffic is stopped or filtered in strategic choke points. Right now it's way too distributed for that to be a large concern.
Your node would help a little bit, and it definitely wouldn't hurt, but the main benefit would be to yourself, securing that transactions you send and receive are valid and picked up by the network.

They can and should advocate for it, but Coinbase doesn't run the show in S2X. That said, they probably have enough clout to make that happen if they really wanted to, but then what would be the point of the fork, it would just fall flat on it's face.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:57:59
It's not actual coins, it's a promise form Bitfinex of delivering such coins to you in the event of a fork.
If you trust Bitfinex, you can put your bitcoins on their exchange. They promise that they will implement functionality to split your bitcoins into bitcoins and segwit2x coins after a potential fork. You can then sell either of those future, split coins to others who want to buy them. Likewise, you can buy such future, split coins from others who want to sell them.
After the fork Bitfinex will split the coins and award it to those who have bought those pairs. If there is no fork, your S2X "coins" will be worthless.
Note that this puts a bit more trust in the exchange than a normal trade. To claim your actual coins (and not just sell them back for $), you will have to wait until some time after the fork. In a normal bitcoin buy, you would be able to withdraw you bitcoins immidiately. You also trust the exchange to solve the split technically, which they should be able to do better than most people, and you also trust them to arbiter any grey area scenarios in a fair way, such as the fork happening but with a delay of a month.

Also, don't forget that we need anonymity/pseudonymity for fungibility and personal integrity. Otherwise, certain coins could become tainted by having moved through a "bad actor". That would mean that you would have to do a thorough analysis of every input of a transaction you receive. That would render Bitcoin useless as a medium of exchange.
Also, if there was no anonymity, everybody would know every single transaction that everybody did. That means that your violent ex will know where you went on a romantic getaway with you new significant other, your employer would know where you spent your salary, and your somewhat malicious government would use this knowledge to oppress you.
The anonymity and fungibility of Bitcoin is one of its fundamental building blocks.

Yes, you're right that the lower it is, the greater of a problem that is. At a certain point it would be unusable, and the difficulty adjustment would take forever. Hard to say where that line is, it could be 6 %, it could be 0.6 %, I don't know. I think that the mining power will be at least between 10-25 % for the original chain within a relatively short time frame of the fork. Both because some miners won't be in on it to start with, but also because some will defect when the price is higher for the original chain. Sooner or later the other miners will give up mining at a loss, and trigger a mass exodus from the 2X chain.

This is good in the current situation, and pretty much guarantees a quick transition from fork to no fork, with BTC the winner.
But I worry about a future scenario, where companies, and maybe governments, put a lot of pressure and propaganda into an undesirable hard fork. If they only need to keep traders convinced, and manipulate the price, for a few days before miners completely abandon mining Bitcoin. I wouldn't sell my coins and a lot of others with me, but that makes it much easier than I would to steal the hash power and maybe the moniker. Have I missed some defensive leverage?

I almost always agree with what writes, so I was a bit surprised by his post above.
You make some good points. Being a good store of value is relative. For someone in the US for example, it's not such a good way to store value, because as you say it is quite volatile. But compare that to say Venezuela or Zimbabwe, and you've got a good case. Especially in circumstances in those countries where getting your hands on physical dollars is difficult, and you run the risk of having them taken from you.
As adoption increases, volatility will go down. The trend is very obvious already. It will then become a good store of value in increasingly many circumstances, maybe even eventually in developed countries, but definitely in more and more developing countries.
Liquidity is also a problem, as you point out. This is something that will also increase with more adoption. What will have an even bigger impact, is when your merchant will want to keep some or all of the bitcoins they accept as payment, to be able to pay suppliers. Then there is no need for conversion fees at all, quite the opposite.
Then as to the technical aspect and user friendliness, that is important for everyone, but especially for those that are not yet involved, and who might also be less versed in IT. It's easy to say that this will come, but somebody will actually have to do it. Looking back a few years there have been a lot of improvements, and I am quite convinced that we will see that trend continue. I will definitely try to do my part. The time frames for any of these scenarios and improvements are anyone's guess.
I agree with you that much of the price right now is based on the potential people see in Bitcoin. If they were to postpone their investment until that potential was realized, then someone else would have already bought on the possibility of that happening, and the price would be much higher by the time they bought. But that's the case with almost any investment that has scenarios where it could be worth much more. Only when the market is very bearish and there is "blood in the streets", will something be valued solely by it's current value.

You're acting like Coinbase has the same kind of market position as MtGox had back in the day. They don't. The combined signatories of the NYA make up a pretty big part of the market, but not that big that they can just take it over. They stand to lose everything and win very little (lose actually, but they don't get that).
That's why they will not go through with it, unless everybody just gives in to their demands. And that won't happen, because the people that invested in Bitcoin are the exact people that believe in their own sovereignty and not giving in to power grabs. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:21:20


Yes they can, they would just use a large number of coins for the same amount of FIAT value. This is how the black market Bitcoin industry has worked for years.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:26:28
That's not how the difficulty to find a block works. It will be the same difficulty for a miner to find a block as before, it's just that in your example there are fewer miners trying. If the price is the same, then it will be exactly as profitable to mine as before the fork. Only if the price of S2X is higher will there be an incentive to stop mining Bitcoin. There are other factors weighing in as well, but these are the basics.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:01:17
That doesn't work either. Someone with many bitcoins can't force me onto a new network that I don't want to be a part of. People also don't want to give up anonymity to vote on arbitrary changes.
In case you mean that in a split you will vote by selling one coin and buying the other, that's a better description of how it would work in a contentious hard fork. Then it's more a function of *amount of bitcoins * conviction*.

Now that the infrastructure is built out, sure mining Bitcoin is as good of an industry for it as any. Better than any actually, with the cold climate and the flourishing greenhouse agriculture.
But please don't build out any more power plants to use for mining. The extensive hydroelectric build out that exists today is a result of government subsidies and corruption. It has destroyed large regions of pristine nature and ecosystems, and hasn't benefited the society economically, except temporarily during the construction.

You're right, it's impossible to measure :). But you can do your best. Which I think is what you should do when you intend to hard fork. The prudent thing to do if your intention is to hard fork without causing a chain split, is to ensure as well as you can, that almost all hash power and economic interest will follow your fork. Even then you can't be sure, so always enable replay protection.
In the current situation, where it is pretty obvious, by many non-conclusive measures, that there is not consensus, the only prudent thing to do is to either not fork or fork without pretending that you will be Bitcoin after the fork. In either case, proper replay protection is in order.

Signature aggregation and MAST for sure if it's needed, but I don't think it will be. Confidential transactions, I'm not so sure. There will need to be some breakthrough, where resource requirements are not drastically heightened, while also not introducing new cryptographic assumptions. That could very well happen, and I would be the first to embrace it, but until then I don't think it will make it into BTC's consensus rules.

Of course they are different in certain regards, in the case of darknet markets you use Bitcoin to get illicit products shipped to you by mail, and buying in a store you use Bitcoin to retain some privacy in your everyday life.
You don't have to use darknet markets to buy illicit goods, people do it because they would rather pay the higher price for the conveniency, quality, and lack of interaction with shady people.
In more and more places there is no option to pay by cash, if people then have the option to use Bitcoin instead of the surveillance nightmares of Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and so on, great. Use case-wise I think it's somewhat analogous to DNMs, but the effect it has on demand and price is very analogous. Bringing use cases is also crucial to the value proposition of Bitcoin, it needs to be both a transactional currency and a store of value to succeed long term. 


Of course I am a a minority right now, most people don't know much about Bitcoin. But as options to use it expand and become more user friendly, as well as financial surveillance expanding, I think this demand will expand drastically.


Anonymity is not black or white. There are situations where Bitcoin is the least anonymous alternative in the world, but there are also possibilities to pay electronically in seconds while retaining almost full privacy and anonymity.

Maybe you have read up on it by now, but from many of your comments it seems like you don't understand that it's not a blockchain,info account on your phone or on your laptop, it's an account on their servers. If you choose to only access that account from a specific device, that's up to you. It doesn't mean, however, that if you or anyone else used the same login details from another device, you wouldn't get access to the account. It's like a webmail, say Gmail or Hotmail in that regard.

These are interesting statistics. Paying for porn was one of the first use cases suggested by Satoshi. I think with Lightning Network micropayments, a new use case could emerge, where you pay per say 10 second segments, without predepositing to a custodial wallet.
This is not just related to porn, but I would not be surprised if it is the first mover, as it is with many things on the Internet. The payment experience would have to be automated, so you would not have to take action every ten seconds, but it would also have to automatically stop paying if you stopped watching.

This is very good advise. The next steps you should take, after the technical and practical aspects of selling it, is what to do once you have converted it into your local currency. Don't spend any of it until you have all of the legal and tax issues sorted out.
Figuring out how much of your proceeds should be paid in taxes should be done by a professional. But for anyone to figuring out, they will probably need to know what your uncle paid for them, if he every sold anything and at what price that was.

They are one of the leading forces behind the takeover attempt. Your scenario is not them going through with it, it's them being reasonable.

It started out as a copy cat shitcoin, but it has managed to get an impressive amount of hash power to secure it, was instrumental in putting pressure on miners to activate segwit, and was a good alternative in transferring funds between exchanges when the BTC fees were at their highest. I think it has earned its place as silver/testbed for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-24 12:50:02
It's difficult enough to run a node for some people as it is. When segwit adoption closes in on 100 % it will be much harder. Doubling block size once more, to 4mb instead of 2, as B2X would do, will force quite a few people to have to trust others to verify their transaction, countering the purpose of Bitcoin.
Maybe a doubling could be acceptable right now, but if it needs a hardfork to make it happen (it does), then there would have to be a lead time of much more than a couple of months, and it would have to be much less contentious. It also makes very little sense not to include other things from the hardfork wishlist.
As another poster has also pointed out, this method of scaling does not work in the long run, so why not do it right from the start, and not set a bad precedent?

It's an increase to 4mb in terms of attack surface, which is an important consideration when deciding how large blocks you can allow from a sucurity standpoint.
In terms of transaction throughput it's closer to 2mb. That's still pretty much a doubling in the long term, which is very good, but should be a secondary consideration to the security of the network.

It will be a combination of the two. After the initial stages where people altruistically charge very little, people will try to gain as much as others are willing to pay. The problem for them is that alternative paths will be possible, so the path with the lowest fees will be chosen, and they will miss out on fees all together. In some cases people will even offer negative fees, so as to get a better balance in their channel.
The absolute lowest possible average fees, that are not altruistic, are those that equal the operating costs. It will not reach that low, but that is what competition will drive it towards.
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:09:37
The phrase can pretty much be a cold storage wallet, meaning that you can store coins on addresses generated from that seed, but you don't have the private keys to any of those addresses stored on any device connected to the Internet.
I'm kind of guessing that you mean hardware wallets? In that case yes, you can import wallets generated from the seed phrase. They follow a standard that is implemented by many wallets. Electrum wallet seed phrases do not follow the standard, and I don't think they can be imported into any of the hardware wallets, but I could be wrong there.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:57:13
You bring up a very important point. I wish the 'debate' hadn't deteriorated to the point where cost/benefits of different solutions can't be discussed rationally, without being drowned in shilling and accusations of shilling.
It would absolutely have been preferable to have a 2X increase in throughput be accompanied by only a 2X attack surface, instead of a 4X one. But I am not aware of any good such solution, that doesn't bring with it other side effects that are worse. Without segwit, or a similar fix, validation time of blocks would scale even worse, and would make it impossible to have blocks much large than 2-4mb anyway. So without segwit we would have a hard time scaling further, which pretty much everyone agrees that we have to do eventually.
Fortunately I think the 4mb attack blocks are mostly a problem if they're kept up for a while, which would would be very expensive. A block that takes forever to validate only has to be produced one or a few times, which would make it a cheaper and more severe attack.
Then we also have the additional benefits of segwit, fixing transaction malleability, and aligning incentives more with the long term costs on the system, with the expanding UTXO set. Here is an excellent article on the subject, if you haven't seen it before. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:15:36
It may. It may also trigger it. Since they have the alternative of mining Bitcoin with those miners, if they have some way of profiting from a price fall, say by shorting it, then wouldn't care so much that they can't mine it more due to a proof of work change.

@_date: 2019-09-30 12:45:41
I know what you mean, but it doesn't really work that way. Bitcoin functions well as it is right now. A blocksize increase would mean that the current chain would have to be abandoned for the new one. It's a decision that the community would have to stand pretty much unanimously behind for it to happen, it's not something that people developing improvements for bitcoin core just 'do'.
I hope all hardware and other bottlenecks keep improving, so that we can increase blocksize even further. It might not happen in practice though, as it could be too difficult to be sure of enough support for the change, and the technology could be too entrenched by that time, with custom implementations, and businesses built around a smaller blocksize.
@_date: 2018-04-15 10:53:57
It's a federated sidechain, meaning you trust a third party with the bitcoins you commit to it. It will never be a very impactful addition to the network unless it is implemented in a more trustless manner, which can be done with a softfork. The best methods for such softforks are still debated, but whatever the method, it will still put economic pressure on miners to validate all sidechain transactions.

I used to be pretty excited about the prospects of RSK as a sidechain, and sidechains in general. Now I'm of the opinion that only sidechains with a small footprint should be enabled by a fork. That means that they should not add significant systems requirements and complexity for miners, because that becomes a centralizing pressure on mining, and centralization in mining has a large enough problem with centralization as it is.
Because the miners will receive a monetary reward for verifying sidechain transactions, they will probably be pretty much forced to do so to stay profitable, since the mining industry operates on such slim margins.
I don't know where the line should be drawn for how large a footprint a sidechain should have at most, in relation to the utility it brings. Miners can be expected to have more expertise and larger investment in infrastructure than the average full node user, but not terribly much so, since we want to be able to withstand a scenario where the network is attacked and fractured. The very least that should be expected, is that the sidechain most prove its utility before it is considered to be forked in.

Not right now, because of the price bubble, but in equilibrium or prolonged downtrends it definitely does.


To verify Bitcoin transactions you need hard drive space for the blockchain, memory for the UTXO set, processing power for computations, and bandwidth for transmitting and receiving blocks. To verify transactions on a sidechain you  would need extra resources to deal with that blockchain as well. If it is a very resource intensive and bloated blockchain, like Ethereum, then the resource requirements would be much large than to simply verify Bitcoin transactions. You would also need to be quite knowledgeable about that blockchain and how to implement it, because if a failure there could cause your entire Bitcoin block to be rejected by the network, that would be extremely costly.
What I mean by footprint is the combination of resource requirements and code complexity. Many sidechains could potentially be worth it to fork in, but I think it's important to have a good understanding of the costs and benefits before making a decision.

Why should we burden miners with complexity and higher systems requirements, just to have Ethereum like smart contracts? A lot can already be done with the smart contract capabilities of Bitcoin, let's see a demand for more complex constructions, before we burden the system with it (launching shitcoins doesn't count).

Sometimes what is good or not cannot be decided until after the fact. All you have to go on then are opinions, preferably informed opinions.
When every technical expert working on the protocol is of a certain opinion about a technical detail, then tell me why we should listen to a bunch of CEO's trying to maximize company profits?

This would be perfect as sarcasm, but you're a troll so I'm guessing it's not meant that way..

Very interesting post.
For someone to make an advanced model, simulating future Lightning Network topologies, you would have to know the initial state (who controls how many bitcoins) and the drivers and incentives.
What are the best public estimations of bitcoins ownership? Based on blockchain analysis I suppose.
Incentives, any other than monetary? The monetary ones; onchain transaction fees, lightning routing fees, hardware costs, any more?
Drivers are the most difficult, because they are infinite, but perhaps they could be estimated satisfyingly by taking the major economic actor groups, and try to define their preferences and behaviour.
It should be possible to make quite good simulations, where variables can be configurable, to determine the robustness of the system, and to introduce addtional, technically feasible, incentives, to mitigate the undesirable scenarios.

It could also be a cover story to attack the BIP 148 chain

Yes? I agree with you, but nothing of that contradicts what I said. A hard fork is a very big deal, if we're doing it to increase blocksize, why not do it right. We might not get another chance.

Maybe it's technically correct to say that if 100 % of miners switch consensus rules to support 2mb base blocks, then there is no chain split. But since there will without a doubt be many users that don't switch to nodes with the new concensus rules, some miners will support them or they will switch proof of work.
This means that in practice either the miners don't fork, or they do and Bitcoin will split.
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:42:43
And while we're at it, why make it 2MB, why not make it progressively larger, based on a conservative prediction of technical development?

They might not care about the price of BTC, since they now hold a large amount of LTC ;)

He's pretty much right, by their definition of a currency, it has to be centrally backed by an entity. Nowadays there is constant debate over what is and what isn't Bitcoin. To me it's obvious that Bcash isn't, for example, but there is no authoritative entity that can proclaim it to be so.
That is what both makes him correct and Bitcoin great.

Because some wallets construct transactions in one way and other wallets construct them in another. They have different settings and different setups, and hiding some of that information can prevent blockchain analysis companies from deciphering which wallet was used to create the transaction.

I don't know what you mean when you say "the Core Developers". First of all, as has been said a million times, "Core" didn't sign the Hong Kong agreement. Individual developers contributing to Bitcoin Core did. Just as some individuals don't want there to be a hardfork to bigger blocks.
Most do though, it's even in the official scaling roadmap. The responsible thing to do though, is to research and test any major change thoroughly. One of the things that could affect the hardfork is the effects of segwit.
If someone releases a client on very short notice, where a contentious hardfork is included or locked in, then go ahead and run that software if you like, no one is stopping you. Enjoy your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:08:42
Yeah, and for a one time doubling of the onchain capacity it's definitely not worth it. At the very least not until the effects of segwit and are visible.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:05:10
Don't make a stupid analogy to floppy disks, it's not applicable.
1Mb increase is a doubling, which is 100 % bigger. I'm not saying it is necessarily too big, but it's a stupid way of scaling up. Bitcoin usage will probably want to scale exponentially for quite a long time. It needs higher level solutions as well as a long term onchain scaling solution, that doesn't require additional, unnecessary hardforks.

It is a building block for signature aggregation, which I assume is what you are referring to. Doing everything at once is unnecessary in this case.
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:17:04
It's without a doubt a bug. The question of whether to fix the bug or not, comes down to downsides and risks versus the cost of fixing it.
The covert version is mostly fixed with segwit, and an additional patch to fix it entirely shouldn't be as difficult to push through if it's needed at that point.
The overt version on the other hand, can only be fixed by changing the proof of work (as I've understood it). The threat has to be pretty big for that to be an option. Maybe it should be done gradually over a very long time, if the downsides are substantial but not critical.
@_date: 2017-06-08 22:04:00
In what sense did they not "include" a 2mb hardfork? In the text you linked, they specifically say that it was agreed that activating segwit first was a requirement for a safe hardfork later.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:53:14
lol :)
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:40:19
You think that's likely, I don't
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:50:39
No they wanted 2mb blocks, not segwit + 2mb hardfork. Segwit was the very elegant solution to this. It enabled 2mb blocks, along with other great improvements. This could also be implemented by a softfork, which is by any measure greatly preferable to a hardfork.
