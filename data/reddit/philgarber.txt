The constitution guarantees free speech without consequence from the *government*. Google can suppress you and call you mean names all it wants. Its service is a privilege, not a right.

Do your force them to wear these? What if they're prefer dollars, hmmmm? This isn't right, dude.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:12:58
Because I assumed. Possibly wrongly.
@_date: 2014-01-08 06:01:38
Yes? Tons of people don't use Bitcoin....
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:20:54
And what's wrong with that? Business is business.

Woa bro. This is more than a little greasy-salesmany.. We're here to help,  not blindly preach.
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:09:24
Downvote me too, guys. I agree with him.

Money has been around since the very dawn of civilization. As long as someone has something someone else needs, there will be money. Are you saying we should all just share? I'd love to see how much you give to charity.

I thought a paper wallet was just a way to bypass your wallet password?  How do paper wallets work?

I'm an LTC investor (...gambler), but this is good news for all of us! 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:04:35
By that do you just mean restarting the program and letting it do it's thing overnight? I've tried that.
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:56:42
Will I get eaten for suggesting ltc?
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:33:55
In the meantime..Where's my money?
Edit - I have a 64 bit OS. Can I reinstall and have my wallet (with my money) appear?

To be fair, I had to send a second email with "URGENT" in the subject, but then he literally replied in &lt;10 minutes. Seems to be a one guy op, so he may just honestly miss an email or two.

Whenever you do, be on the up and up about it. Tax evasion is no joke when you're dealing with so much money. Also a functioning government is good,  and stuff.

Here's my 2 cents (inherently uneducated for reasons below) why I think cryptocurrencies in general might be in trouble.
I'm 17 years old and a freshman in community college. I'm a *photography* major. I have never taken a economics class, I have no family in the banking industry to learn abouy money from. I certainly have no prior experience in currency trading. I am not a computer person, I can't code, nothing.
Yet I am an ltc miner.
Money is complicated. That's why banks exist. The average joe doesn't know how the system works, so they place their faith in an institution. I don't know what's going to happen, I'm flying blind and learning as I go. You know who turned me on to crypto mining? A guy who knows no more about the system than I do. You have idiot's like me playing your game now knowing *just* enough to be overconfident. That's dangerous.
I don't know what to think about cryptos vs gov supported "real" money. Are banks evil? I don't think so. Is a gov supported currency evil? I don't think so. Should my money be restricted to 9-4 on week days? I don't think so. Is anon currency good? I think so, but I don't know. I unlike most people I know trust my government to a degree. I've studied a little political science and I am sure as fuck no libertarian. Centralization is a natural function of society, as are governments. Show me a long-lived example to dispute this.
I don't really know what I'm trying to say but I suppose that's the point.

Think I'll get a weekend reply?
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:04:14
First off, congratulations you SOB. Secondly, pay your applicable taxes bro. You can't explain away an extra million or whatever; it wouldn't help our cause for you to land in jail.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:17:47
No worries.  Thanks for the honesty. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:03:43
Thanks. I'll look into it.

What do you imagine the collapse of btc would mean for other cryptocurrencies? Do you think that gov regulation would hit btc only, or all cryptos?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:37:02
I disagree. The reasons for a government to dislike bitcoin are not only applicable to the US. A government needs revenue to survive. While not a problem with bitcoin itself, the bitcoin culture is extremely tax unfriendly.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:44:16
Yes please. I managed to miss both the btc AND ltc trains... Just chillin with my .069 btc. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:52:27
I haven't it just felt a little blind to me. No harm no foul. Passion is good :).
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:18:33
It can keep crashing until next week when I can buy, far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:58:22
I have 6 tenths of a bitcoin...Yippie?

In general. I sent a tech support question this afternoon.
