I’m so sorry for your loss. I know the frustration well, I’d be a millionaire if I didn’t sell most of mine. 
I figure I would have sold at some point along the way up regardless, hindsight is always 20/20.

I feel like the answer is: absolutely. Bitcoin really isn't that private it's just socially private.

Hmmm... withdrawal, getDepositAddress, quote, depth, createOrder, orderStatus, cancelOrder, accountInfo etc off the top of my head
In all currencies used.

I couldn't find anything on market data on their API page. Can you? 
I certainly don't want to use an authenticated API for public data...
EDIT: Found the documentation here:  Here's the new Pastebin code with live BTC/LTC reading:

Donated $5 via credit card and attached a note to accept Bitcoin too - hopefully they listen this way :)

Bitstamp doesn't withdraw in CAD so use them to withdraw to your USD account anywhere. Coinbase is us banks only.

It is only capable of monitoring bitcoin and litecoin addresses, so if that investment has one, then yes.

Please don't - take the code and run it locally for your own records. No private keys etc needed.

Looks like 10% on the Gox price. Not terrible for the convenience, once Gox evens out.

I see - so he's the only one who's stepped up to the plate and donated his time to improve, or are there others?
What if he "gets hit by a bus" (as the saying goes) - will the bitcoin network be un-updateable until we find a person/collective we all trust? What kind of software fragmentation exists today?
@_date: 2013-05-24 03:47:58
Thanks for the link
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:57:19
I guess if you build the API first, then your site, it makes the API really easy to understand as your site becomes the example of all functions.
@_date: 2013-07-21 18:13:12
I concur - we need something with a better user interface.

I imported it into blockchain.info's web wallet. Then I downloaded their app and I had access to it.

First tip! Thanks gamerandy!

Good point actually, and I'm with you by the way, my tools all support multi currency by first letter diff. Personally I have stake in btc and ltc but once you code for multi, you can easily add other first letters.

Hey - this is cool - I made a little tool for tracking net worth, could be cool to integrate this into your history feature.

Actually if PayPal was smart they would leverage their existing banking relationships to embrace bitcoin. They have full ability to bring it mainstream and be the leader in bitcoin=&gt;fiat processing. And still collect their fees from that.

I can't watch the video now, but often being involved in startups, I'm so down with this concept.

Makes sense - and deter fraud - but can I actually use my credit card yet? It says temporarily disabled.
@_date: 2013-08-11 12:38:02
Right now their charge is 11%, the site says 4% is what they want to charge. I think it's because interac charges a high base fee, and at $10 max it needs to be 11%
@_date: 2013-08-20 03:07:02
What app are you using? It probably generated a public/private pair in the background and keeps the private hidden from you. Easy enough to make your own pair with bitaddress.org and pay that address if you want control.
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:12:21
No objection here

CaVirtex in Canada is a known one, but I'm referring to the exchanges I keep see popping up - First thing I've been checking for is an API to see if I can implement.

I'm more thinking: "nobody sell so the price keeps going up"

Thanks Alex - I'd like to come to the next one, but I'm confused at your suggestion of how August8 + 2weeks = this coming Monday?
@_date: 2013-08-20 03:02:28
Think gift cards:
no value until loaded
load with the number on the front of the card (public key)
scratch the scratchy part on the back for the security code (private key)
security code = access to the money, do not lose or reveal. (if giving private key to an app, you'd better trust it)
Everything else is mechanics, that's what you need to know to use them.

Any service that accepts alt coins is increasing their risk surface area. They need to hold these coins at least temporarily, and if they're devalued drastically by a 51% attack, the whole company is at risk. Since bitcoin has the least risk of a 51, it's the safest bet.
I know it's not the answer you're looking for, but some food for thought.

I'd assume the spread between cavirtex and mtgox in CAD is a good indicator of the time delay. Not sure why their CAD deposits are delayed, I thought the problem was with USD

Change their product *duration* to make it more affordable:
By-the-minute full access to the best sites, with no confirmation (instant) bitcoin deposits. They could make a killing off quarters.

The only thing that seems new is the actual order input - it auto calculates some values for you.

In fairness, you can't send cash instantly anywhere in the world for a fraction of a cent. I can pack $1Billion in BTC in my suitcase, can't do that with cash.

I think the idea is preparing for a mature Bitcoin economy. This isn't a transitional product that facilitates the initial Fiat&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin issues, it's a product that will be awesome when most merchants accept Bitcoin and the question then becomes logistics.
Edit: Personally, I'm looking for a bank I can trust with my BTC - I wish TD would do this or buy coinkite when they're ready to.

Yea I once had the great idea of credit card -&gt; bitcoin. Consider it a favour.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:07:02
1) More and more Bitcoin is lost each day - this means there is less of it, driving up the price further. I see this as a good thing personally. Since Bitcoin goes to 8 decimal places, we'll start talking in micro-coins etc.
2) When someone dies today, they leave a will with instructions on handling their affairs (if they have any). If you're an owner of Bitcoin, and you consider it an asset, then you should have instructions for your benificiaries to collect your coins. Maybe the location of your private keys? I have mine printed and hidden so its easy for me to disclose if I want to.
