A few things -
The 'government' routing Tor traffic has to snoop on its incoming and outgoing connections if it wants to spy on its users, even then if you're using Tor properly your traffic and privacy should be protected.
Bitcoin is functionally and cryptographically different.

If you are only using Blockchain.info - this is not cold storage and your address is vulnerable to attack.
Unless you have your private key stored somewhere else, a bitcoin web wallet such as blockchain.info is the most basic level of wallet security one could have despite its connection to the Bit Card.
If you are going to use a web wallet, use Coinkite.
If you want a secure wallet on your computer, use Electrum.
Never use Blockchain.info as your main wallet, and always make sure you move your coins to a new address if you receive them from someone else.

From a female: point to examples like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, as kids who got computers at a young age and built the next empire
Bitcoin is like that

I like the idea and there are some practical applications - only concerns were whether the private keys are held in the application if this a browser extension.

Thank you for the highlight!

This is really good for the community. Great seeing more Bitcoin education offerings, and I like the mention of DApps in your course plans. 
Would highly recommend you consider these course ideas:
1. Serpent 101 - Programming Smart Contracts 
2. Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets from Bip32 and beyond 
3. Cryptography 100 - for Bitcoin Developers
Feel free to use these course titles, they were conceived in the course of writing this post and I would love seeing these courses being offered.

A few things:
Not every device will keep a record of the blockchain.
Your public key is the Bitcoin address (for example your address can be shown as a QR code)
Your private key is used to encode the transactions, effectively signing it with a cryptographic key
This private key is what you need to unlock your wallet, the use of your private key and public key allows access to your wallet.

I mistakenly put 2 BTC into Cloudhashing and realized afterwards they don't allow you to sell your Ghashes like Cex.
I wouldn't recommend cloud hashing to anyone.

Definetly have something in writing that explains your idea.
Post it to share with the community and collect further feedback - as you've already done!
And consider there are multiple ways of planning how to crowdfund using crypto, whether you create a token or give out crypto equity make sure you accept bitcoin above all else:)

Bigger block sizes does not affect the security and strength of the platform.
 A hard fork might.

Expect zero privacy when there is a Bitcoin service hosted on a cloud server.

Adopting the Blockchain does not require adopting bitcoin - to a degree
The Blockchain is essentially a distributed database network and any business or individual can harness this platform to track, encode, and even store (small amounts) of data.
Bitcoin is a network token and it exists because of the Blockchain, you can send and receive bitcoin which uses the Blockchain to record activity.
To adopt the Blockchain without Bitcoin there are certain models which make this possible:
- Broadcasting a message on the Blockchain
- Encoding/ hashing data into the Blockchain which will require Bitcoin unless you leverage:
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:35:56
At this time in Bitcoin there isn't a complete solution that can do accounting for Bitcoin organizations - most require you to import transaction data (csv)
Interesting analysis from Blocktrail, 4% of donations are from miners

It's already in the works.

Personal identity for Blockchain agreements are going to be huge for Smart Contracts - check out Trustatom as they've proposed a way to do this on Bitcoin
They've already raised some pre seed funding to tackle this, website is trustatom.com

Definitely the Bitcoin Blockchain with Factom - you can use it to create a chain of your own records

10 million coins per project, only new coins are awarded as bounties for work against the project. They're using colored coins - open assets protocol to create these coins on the Bitcoin Blockchain.
Colored coins open assets works by labeling tx ouputs not embedding metadata
