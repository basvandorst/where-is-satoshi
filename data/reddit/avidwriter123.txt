awesome I've always wanted one of these.  expect an order soon!
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:25:10
it's true.  their inner lesbian starts to poke out.  pun intended
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:38:25
any update on what happened?
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:15:42
His name was Robert Paypal.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:25:45
we'll have brain-implantable VR by the time he gets out so might as well enjoy it
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:38:56
they still use mtgox
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:34:36
are there any to use on a car's rear window?
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:56:12
yes.  on second thought, no.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:27:30
unless you convert to fiat and deposit in a bank, they track that pretty closely and you could get dinged in an audit

the good people of colorado aren't idiots
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:45:42
is there any security risk in doing this if you also use it as a wallet?
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:35:50
hello IPS goodness
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:47:39
what they should have done is quietly contact the other exchanges so they could all implement the necessary software changes simultaneously, instead of publicly announcing a potential blockchain vulnerability; basically giving hackers all the tools they needed to launch an attack.

I went the opposite direction tonight-bought some best buy gift cards with btc and got a new nexus 7 for essentially half price. It rocks :-)
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:06:58
not with that attitude
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:58:19
@_date: 2014-01-01 08:12:06
yeah i was dumb.  oh well.  getting back into mining some altcoins to make up for it now.  going to hold this time and see where it goes:)
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:15:07
great idea.  if you're looking for more readers let me know, I have a BA in English Literature and would love to do some part time work for BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-25 15:27:50
the ball is rolling now!
@_date: 2014-01-25 14:36:40
I've used Gyft successfully with Target cards is joinsnapcard legit?  would love them for newegg.

currently using middlecoin, it mines the most profitable ones and auto converts to BTC and pays out in that.  it's easier than doing all the trading myself.  running dual 7850s now but just picked up a r9 280x and will swap that in for one and get a 2nd rig up and running as money permits:)

@_date: 2014-02-28 09:41:26
Such a mundane ending for all the drama they caused everyone
@_date: 2014-02-27 21:54:19
that's what's wrong with our politicians, they're always looking for the low-hanging fruit to score a few points rather than putting any real effort into their jobs.  term limits would be such a beautiful thing, it would get the idiots out of there faster and people might actually focus on doing their jobs instead of worrying about reelection years down the road.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:24:26
i'll give you 1goxbtc for that

i've never met so many assholes in a game as WoW had.

have to appeal to the lowest common denominator be it soccer moms or whatever.  
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:00:20
it was mildly amusing.  COO of bitcoin was the best part
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:37:20
this is a known problem currently being experienced by bitcoin.  it's the reason mtGox closed temporarily.  nothing to worry about it should clear up on its own in a day or so
@_date: 2014-01-01 07:37:39
I had 12 and sold at $5.  cry for me
@_date: 2014-09-16 05:30:53
they probably mean through gyft
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:20:24
and karples is a brit who drinks tea lol
@_date: 2014-07-01 12:12:36
I still find their customer service miles above that of tigerdirect.  The website is better laid out too.  I still stick with them any chance I have.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:34:12
NO needs a period.  then they balance out
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:48:41
heh gash.

i hear vista is looking pretty snazzy nowadays

i don't know why it is, but it seems people who know the least about things are always in the position to regulate them

still no news yet.  really wondering what's going to come of all of this.  
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:45:36
but did he really?
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:01:39
super-white guy ^
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:25:41
just discovered this today it was glorious
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:09:03
except for all the jobs it creates and the increased trade it promotes it sure sucks yeah!
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:04:02


@_date: 2014-03-03 10:26:34
dem brits are trading like crazy right now prices up all over
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:07:05
that doesn't fly too well in the open-source community.  people like to be in charge of their own boxes
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:54:37
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:44:53
their old-money conservatism is pretty apparent, and isn't really suited for bitcoin.  they may get some wealth from their BTC holdings but I don't expect them to be major players in the bitcoin space years down the road.
@_date: 2016-03-02 00:17:40
can you do reverse ACH to withdraw your money now too?
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:37:24
it's a good analogy to Microsoft because it nearly destroyed their company.  keep in mind though that google has their toes in many different areas, and not supporting BTC isn't a dealbreaker right now for them
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:14:46
China is awake, EU still sleepy.  US, will be interesting

edit- china is going nuts right now
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:32:59
Wait a couple hours til EU wakes up.  china drove it up 10% then we get the US after EU.

i used to have 15 bitcoins.  i sold at $5.  fin
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:08:27
most of those people sold out since then and are very pro-establishment at this point.
@_date: 2015-03-29 02:14:15
there's a name I've not heard in a long time
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:01:47
it's not inflation that's causing this, it's a rise in prices.  companies jack up prices on everything under the sun, all the money goes to the top executives, while wages are stagnant, means you have less purchasing power.
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:45:17
so much bureaucracy it makes my head hurt
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:10:24
still waiting for the price to swing somehow (in either direction)
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:06:18
