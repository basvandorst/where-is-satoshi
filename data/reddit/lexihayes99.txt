Google is stoopid

It’s true, but it’s the base for where this technology started, it’s like saying you like cars and think they are great and handy but you never believed in the Ford Model T
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:11:02
Again completely agree. I think because I am so passionate about the technology etc.. it affects my hope that in the end it will succeed. Not to say I will be right. 
Yes the community is still in its infancy but that to me just means there is amazing potential for growth and adoption, if as you mention governments do not find a way to stop it.

@_date: 2018-10-16 06:37:16
Exciting times ahead me thinks

@_date: 2018-10-16 12:00:34
Litecoin has value? Undervalued too
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:34:43
Just to show how far we have come in 5 years
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:29:30
That’s really cool
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:52:25
so true
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:16:01
Yeah that’s what I was thinking having just checked a bunch of prices ��
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:24:10
I agree, but you can’t say where we are headed is not super exciting, going to be hell of a ride still
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:28:08
Completely agree
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:56:06
Great post! 
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:22:00

Was getting out of hand
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:39:41
What a beautiful specimen
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:20:26
There is so much room for growth though, last December/Jan just showed us how much potential there is! 
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:55:00
Would be amazing, could say that about any technology though
@_date: 2018-10-16 10:19:21
Yeah, in terms of product etc.. low transaction fees + speed it is massively undervalued I think, disagree?
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:59:34
Yeah I completely agree with you, it will definitely take some time, however, we will go back up to 19-20k and beyond in the coming years... yes years, not months. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 14:04:35
Not saying I entirely disagree, but what about it being faster, with lower fees?
