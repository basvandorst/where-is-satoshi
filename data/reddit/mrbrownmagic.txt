Ok calm down Rainman
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:48:45
What do you mean by amazon and google creating their own platform? Pray tell
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:19:20
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:57:44
How does that make sense? You can generate someone else’s private key as your own?
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:57:19
What’s so special about omisego 
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:45:13
Any more detail on this than that one paragraph?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:03:30
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:00:37
That’s how it works. 
Why would it be on the news? You’re talking like any time an I bank sneezes crypto, the news picks it up. 
You realize their research team costs tens of millions of dollars and that they don’t give this stuff out for free right?
@_date: 2018-02-16 20:52:29
Hahahah. Nice idea but needs better implementation. Clean up the audio and work on your linguistics
Also get right into it I don’t need all minutes long garbage beforehand, I’m trying to go to sleep
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:30:47
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:54:59
1, that’s socialism
2, you’re comparing that to maintaining an investment portfolio? For reals?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:35:30
But, do bitcoins illegal?
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:39:06
What’s with that url
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:45:50
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:41:11
How do you know all this?
Can you tell me if the girl I end up marrying will be rich?
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:03:04
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:12:52
You for reals?
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:11:35
Not worth the watch
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:33:08
That happened to me before. I emailed coinbase about it and they said they fixed it. Was able to perform transactions relatively soon
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:25:14
Why’s that?
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:33:25
I would love if people regularly bombarded CNBC’s twitter feed with how they’re a terrible financial news source. They’re irresponsible and all glamour.   Switch to Bloomberg already 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:14:45
Hahahaha 
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:05:09
Nah I’m good 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:28:35
So just to be clear - are you saying you think it’ll hit 50k?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:08:34
Who the help is Steve Strongin 
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:56:32
Any way to get a copy of the whole thing?
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:13:11
1.  Kid owns a crypto consulting firm now
2. Kid needs to find fine jeans without holes in them
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:43:14
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:25:36
I was just saying that you’re really cool
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:13:40
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:26:56
Whatever you gotta tell yourself guy
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:20:21
Oh shit! Sell sell sell!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:21:14
I didn’t watch. But is this why bitcoin cash was up while the others were down today? Racists stocking up on it?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:04:32
Not grumpy. You’re just spreading bad information 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:42:35
What!? Sell sell sell!!!!
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:49:32
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:10:33
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:22:56
Why would you listen to anyone who thinks this biometric system they conjured up is a good idea?

You answering one question was your AMA?
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:58:54
If you don’t know who he is by now, you don’t deserve to
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:16:53
Well. That’s discouraging 
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:45:54
Yep. Got that one too
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:50:12
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:14:39
Yeah. You got it buddy
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:14:33
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:35:43
Whatever you say mate
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:40:00
Yes diamonds are rare...though, technically they’re not. 
What does that tell you
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:17:05
You want the government to open up an investment portfolio in private industry?  Let alone volatile assets?For reals?
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:48
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:44:25
Now I’m confused at what you’re confused at
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:07:26
Hahahaha 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:00:47
Hahah. I can see that....He’s poison though. Toxic for people’s minds
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:22:58
It sounds to be you think the living conditions are as they are all around the world 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:10:58
Are you dense 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:06:56
Oh the truth came out???
And it’s readily accessible on qoinbook.com? Can’t wait!
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:54:58
I’ve been trying to close my kraken account since December. They just ignore me
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:41:19
So you’re telling me it will never hit 50k
How about 80k?
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:55:26
Not gonna click, but that’s hilarious. You’ve gotta be kidding me 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:23:17
Alright calm down
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:39:22
What does he have to say about the families he ripped off?
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:28:20
Hahah ����
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:23:35
So you’re saying you don’t believe in crypto
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:24:50
What?! Buy buy buy!!!
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:37:18
You’re so funny
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:37:25
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:59:48
Give it another day or two 
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:23:46
Ah. Should be a quick read then. Just picked it up today. 
Any recommendations for a good technical read?
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:03:39

What’s so special about omisego?

@_date: 2018-02-12 09:24:56
Typically need to be a client to get access to such research reports
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:58:39
Salty. Cool man
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:19:03
You’re so cool
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:34
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:40:32
Oh sweet! Ok. Hang on, sending over

@_date: 2018-02-12 10:32:49
Alright calm down Alex Jones. 
Ordinary folk that have Jpm financial advisors would also have access. 
I imagine whoever wrote that article has a friend who works there, and that friend said ‘hey you might be interested in this’
No other news source mentioned it cause it’s just a research paper. It’s not a big deal, and it’s also the weekend. Maybe it’ll trickle out. Maybe it won’t. They write thousands of research papers. It’s not a big deal
From what I glanced over and the language, they looked like legit docs
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:33:59
Why does Alex Jones have such a big following?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:14:54
To watch more of him would be to subject myself to so much of what is wrong with this world
