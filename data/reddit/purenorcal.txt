Looks nice, way more modern. Facebook and Twitter icons should direct to the specific pages. Reddit icon should be added as well. All of these icon directs show how strong this community is. My 2 cents.

Or use DASH which is way faster and cheaper for something like this. Keep BTC as gold 2.0. Forget BCH, what a joke.

This report came out in November 2017.  As time goes on, more and more BTC will be lost forever, decreasing the supply dramatically.

Late last year a digital forensics firm analyzed the BTC blockchain and concluded that on the low end 2.78M BTC have been lost since inception. On the high end, close to 4M BTC! So really, the attainable cap is lower than 21M.

Couldn't agree more.

Comparing purchasing a mining contract vs buying the coins outright themselves is like comparing apples to potatoes. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:32:32
All depends on when you get in on the mining and what happens with the price and difficulty. So really, if you do your research and can predict where things are going, it makes sense. Sounds like you lack the intelligence to make that happen.

Got it, thanks. So it really doesn't matter then if support drops below 80% in this block segment?
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:42:01
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:33:19
Not really.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:26:51
Haha, whatever you say. I'm in profit after only 7 months in the mining contracts I chose. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:07:53
I know but you have to diversify! I have BTC as well.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:49:57
And what are you basing this off of? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:23:38
Don't we still need 80% or above maintained till they all start rejecting the non-Segwit blocks? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:09:06
So what happens now? It is at 79.1%?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:58:46
Hardly a tough guy, just want you to back up your statement ..
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:53:39
Instead of running your mouth why don't you provide some facts.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:45:38
Right on, I think that is a huge factor in regards to supply cap.  Nice website by the way.
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:03:53
Thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:09:43
Didn’t realize NEO is powering the back end. Very impressive.

There should be some verbiage about the 2.8M-3.8M BTC lost forever as of November 2017 and that number has probably increased since -
