big pools just ignoring small fees, they add empty blocks. So you need wait when your good, but small fee will be added by more modest pool. So no choice, wanna fast, need pay, even if mempool is empty(

@_date: 2017-03-28 16:57:23
They can just not accept your payment with small fees. And next time you will pay more.Many blocks from big pools not full, cos they not wanna our small fees.     Also is very possible, that popular wallet get pay from miners for they fake calculations. How you can explain why i see 0.0004 in electrum, even if mempool empty?
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:57:24
yes, even if it so, without HF segwit haven't chance, cos some hashrate voting against. So there only one way - is segwit+2mb hf. Maybe it take more time, but why it still was not announced, for what this war? Even if they hate each other, here are millions of people who are completely dependent on the pride of several people. Such irresponsibility is very discouraging

This story will never stop. Today we can't find consensus about size of block. Let's split. Tomorrow we wouldn't find consensus about total supply. Next step will split us when come time of AML &amp; KYC. And most important, for what this all? Encrease of block with HF is just question of time. Why just no encrease block size to 2mb + segwit? I thought miners was agreed for this?

Bitcoin new money. Five billion users and one coin = current million in usd. Or $0.01 per sat. Today we pay $1 and more. So even when 1btc = 1m, everyone can pay fees much less $1
If open/close channel = make on chain transaction
Avg block time 10min, block size 1mb. Five billion users.  Each will open two channel per year and closed two channel per year ( How you think it's enough?) That's mean 20 billion on chain tx per year or 54.7m per day, or 380k tx per block. 
Today avg full block have ~2k tx. 190 times less than needed (with only 2 open/closed channel per year, what to low)
This mean that average Joey never can open channel. Channels will be only for billionaires.

miners node can retranslate tx too) Just up more connections. Also some nodes come with BTC business, some will up by enthusiasts, like now. Non mining node just help to retranslate tx, nothing more. If an nodes set wrong rules nothing not happen, if miners followed consensus. B/c non mining nodes cannot mine and orphan blocks. Only miners can. And consensus now is a segwit2x. The business and miners nodes will enough. Nodes with wrong rules will disconnected from network




@_date: 2017-08-08 21:30:13
well, right now work only simple increase of block size, like and in 2010. That's fact. When people find better solution, will another talk. Btw can you example few things that Satoshi thought impossible?


lol people talk about it from start and was simple solution -

Right. But nothing not changed from that time in btc ideology. 1mb still not scale. And we still need increase block every time when we close to cap. That was plan in 2010 and nothing not changed today
I invested in Bitcoin. Bitcoin haven't problem with scale, at least until we not stop technical progress. 1mb - not scale and it not was Bitcoin plan. This is Blockstream vision. So i only hope, that soon we will get rid of this toxic vision

for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. 


@_date: 2017-05-29 14:13:40
You right. But i dont see any problem in bitcoin, with scalability. Just increase blocksize step by step, 2,4,8,16mb. Thats was a bitcoin plan. Also fix malleability and implement 2layer, this will make btc even better

i will follow the longest chain and BTC ticker will follow the longest chain. With core, bitmain or without them. So it's unpossible, i always will be in BTC.

ofc we all fucking trolls and spamers, and stupid miners, stupid like Satoshi). Main thing what we need is a run full node) Nevermind that few tx cost like month hosting node) Lol man stop spend your time to me. I already have a stomach ache) I can't speak serious with Core minion

Yes or no?

@_date: 2017-07-24 20:56:14
this haven't any sense. Wallets not create and not orphaned blocks. So wallets cant create alternative chain.
Only what they can, is a watch how miners fucking network
imagine, you open your non mining node (next time wallet) and see that miners changed rules. What next? 
The morality of this fable is as follows - if miners want destroy network, they will do it . And no matter, see currently you this or no. They can destroy it now (with 6k node) or later (with 100 node) 
So untill now no no ones exemple, of invalid information from spv. Wallets only watch and do nothing. 
So only miners and small category of people need run full node
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:33:33


Lol what are you talk about. Non mining node cant do it)
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:15:56

open your eyes   We havent time. We needed did HF in 2015, before mempool full, not when. Toxic Core team banned all big blockers in this reddit. What are you talk about?
What you call spam, normal people call transactions. How you determine what is spam and what is not? 
We already can work with 8mb. Ten year later will work with 30mb. Twenty year later will work with 1gb (overdo)
check hash  (click on Btc label) and 
2nd output is a hash of the document with an extract from the register of real estate of Georgia
They move their real estate data to blockchain, with Bitfury help. This one of the big "spammers", if you wanna call it spam(
This is your  "spammers" . People who use Bitcoin. Who play in casino, who register real estate, who buy food, send coins to friends. We all fucking spammers.

@_date: 2017-07-25 10:19:59


Nope. Only what can do your node - ignore blocks or retranslate them. But if miners add this block to chain, you can't do with it anything. Your node can't create alternative chain, b/c not mine and not orphaned blocks. Your node will just kick out from network. If miners will ignore your tx and will not accept it into blocks - you cant do anything
In same time if &gt;51% miners change the rules and attack network, they will lose money. And your node not help. Only economics part make bitcoin safe. When miners make more money being honest, than dishonest. Or they can change rules and make more money like in our situations with 2x. In this case they still will honest and your node with old rulles will be kick out from network
So as you can see, full node no need for most users (not for all, but for most) If you wanna support network, better buy asics and start mine


Ok. But do you know at least one case when SPV wallet was scammed by wrong validate? Just interesting. I dont know. Maybe you?
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:13:05


@_date: 2017-07-25 11:51:33
will see. Some exchanges already said, that the longest chain will called BTC. That mean x2
I think your master banned me. Now i can send an message not often than 1 per 10 min. Good job
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:25:21


No, Nodes cannot reject any blocks. They can ignore. This is very different things
Only one reason is a b/c miners economically interested party. If they lose this interes, they will do all what they want. And your wallet will only watch
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:14:10
for what? Node not create and not orphaned blocks. So wallets cant create alternative chain. Satoshi said only people, who create btc will run node. Other will use spv. So if you not miner, you not need run node
Read whitepaper
@_date: 2017-07-25 11:19:00
you can't say who is honest or dishonest. I like sunbathe naked, you think naked people unacceptable. Just your opinion against my. This is why we have POW. Not matter, what think you or think i. Until miners have economical motivation we safe...  
This is why we need encrease block size, step by step. B/c when inflation down, miners will earn only from block fees. The more block, the cheaper tx, the more useful network, the more people come to Bitcoin, the more tx in big blocks, the more money earn miners, the safer network
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:17:36
yes, with only one different. I will be always in Bitcoin network. You will only in one case 'no fire Core' . I think you lost Bitcoin idea. Your btc is a Core team.  My btc is a longest chain, with an devs, countries, masters, miners and so on or without all of them
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:10:10
so funny, non mining nodes wanna get little love and power) 
To support the network by running a node, select:
 Options-&gt;Generate Coins :)
Nodes collect new transactions into a block, hash them into a hash tree,
// and scan through nonce values to make the block's hash satisfy proof-of-work
// requirements.  When they solve the proof-of-work, they broadcast the block
// to everyone and the block is added to the block chain.  The first transaction
// in the block is a special one that creates a new coin owned by the creator
// of the block.
if you not mining node.... you just an wallet :)
@_date: 2017-07-25 10:54:57
Considering that at the moment consumers of BTC are mostly traders and investors (people who interested only price), the economic majority is reduced to the nodes of large exchanges and to wallets of huge whales
I just wanna say, that nodes (not exchanges) means nothing in Bitcoin network. Someone can spend 150k usd, run 5k nodes with new rules. Are you wanna say attacker with 150k usd can kill 40bil network? Not serious

@_date: 2017-07-25 15:49:27


Ok i imagine it. Bitcoin new money. Five billion users and one coin as current million in usd
One BTC = 100m Sat = $0.01 per sat. Today we pay $1 and more. So even when 1btc = 1m, everyone can pay fees much less $1
When you talk about off chain scaling, im counting on the fact, that you understand the basic things, like open/close channel = make on chain transaction. Do you ok with this info? Then, lets make some calculate
Avg block time 10min, block size 1mb. Five billion users.  Each will open two channel per year and closed two channel per year ( How you think it's enough?) That's mean 20 billion on chain tx per year or 54.7m per day, or 380k tx per block. 
Today avg full block have ~2k tx. 190 times less than needed (with only 2 open/closed channel per year, what to low)
This avg calculation, with uniform distribution. In real world somedays will ATH with amazing number of tx. Like first and last month of year
What this mean? This mean that average Joey never can open channel. Channels will only for billionaires. Billionaires is a banksters. Do you wanna Bitcoin for banksters?
What you think about it?
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:24:06
ASIC's time is only question of profit. If manufacture see profit, they will make ASIC's for any POW algo. Idk why you think that ASIC's bad, more hashpower for less money... that's good

Well this is b/c no SPV scamming cases. Not b/c you not heard. And you even dont know why no. Also i know many banking scam cases. For last 3 years half banks in my country was closed. So...  just read white paper, b/c you dont know what is Bitcoin
