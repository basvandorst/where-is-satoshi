Every time I see another place accepting bitcoin, it feels more real and more surreal at the same time.
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:14:53
Ok, interesting to know.  I guess we are perpetuating the 'mistake'.  But, I wonder: at what point does the original meaning, or lack thereof, not matter any more? It wouldn't be the first time such an evolution of language took place.  If the vast majority of people see it as 'hold on for dear life' then the only thing stopping that from being so would be the minority of people HODLing onto the fact that it wasn't intentional.  Know what I mean?
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:33:10
Yea I have no doubt about that. I’m just talking about being open to the fact that words, acronyms, and language in general are not static. But apparently people feel very strongly about it being a typo and this typo is excluded from being used in any other form despite its prevalence in ‘bitcoin culture.’  
In the end, we didn’t realize it was such a serious offense, and we’re sorry. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:31:14
Yea some other people have pointed that out.  I think there's room for debate, but I'm clearly late to the discussion so I'm not gonna push my point too hard.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:56:09
Hey thanks for the link.  So, yea, we are late to the party.  This post is the actual first time we know of HODL appearing?
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:43:50
It's exactly this sort talk that inspired us to make [gear and swag in this man's honor](
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:40:30
Haha sure. I guess we look a bit silly now... but I'm still sticking to my guns that there's enough room in this universe for the unintentional typo to coexist with the new 'meaning' of HODL as a verb and acronym.
edit: u/Rannasha you know what I mean?
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:50:21
That thumbnail is definitely not a t-shirt.  Whoops!
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:53:13
It wasn't the original meaning, but it's evolved to mean 'hold on for dear life." Are we mistaken?
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:40:31
That’s a good one too. Be careful with acronyms around these parts though. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 15:02:28
Anyone have a list of all the countries that have gone through a period like this one?
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:32:38
Consider yourself stickered.
@_date: 2019-02-12 22:40:19
Oops, we just sent you a PM updating you.  Unfortunately, we are only able to offer free shipping to the US and Canada (we didn't anticipate that problem).  
Please check your PM, as we are trying our best to get something to you anyways.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and thanks for working with us along the way.
@_date: 2019-02-13 01:10:20

@_date: 2019-02-12 21:52:55
We’re aware of an issue some users are experiencing while applying the codes. We’re not sure why this is happening, but we have a plan to resolve it within the next 60 minutes. Please hang tight if you’re experiencing issues!

Ok, ok, but I really am going to stop giving out codes....soon.

Unfortunately we can't offer free shipping to Australia :/
International shipping is $14.99, but if that is too unappealing for you, just send us a PM and we will be happy to work with you.  We offered something for free, so the least we can do is try and meet you half way.
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:16:53
