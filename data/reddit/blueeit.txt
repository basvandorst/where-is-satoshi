Is Bitcoin the only crypto being used? Are coins like Dash and Monero being used also?
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:20:48
See if someone around there will accept bitcoin as payement or partial payement.  It's still early in adoption I know. Lol But would be pretty cool
@_date: 2019-07-07 02:56:07
That's awesome! I definitely believe Dash will be a contender because of its transaction speeds. I would think provacy coins like Monero would start being adopted to if they try and crack down on cryptos where you live.

Some of the best places would be Coinbase or Coingate. They have merchant apps that allow you to accept cryptos and then exchange them to fiat if you want.

That's a bandwagon

Easier way to track your spending and bundle that info to advertisers. Don't fucking use this shit folks

Or soda pop

It has. Especially the mobile apps and gui softwars. But adopting new protocols and layers for quicker transactions still need to be implimented into them is what I was refering to. While others like nano and dash have already solved that issue.

No I don't. It will however always be remember as the one that started it all. Unless transcation speed improves I don't ever see it being the true global currency in the future. Impressive? Hell yea it is!

Agree. In order for mass adoption it will have to solve mass understanding of how processes like that works. Or at least simplified enough for the everday individual to utilize it properly

Any foreigner in another country whether for business or vacation would benefit from it. Not having to deal with the confusion of different currencies would make the visit much more enjoyable.

Just crazy to think of how many fortunes were lost from it.

BInanace is a reputable exchange in my opinion. If buying the big 4 then Coinbase is a good place to start also

What station is this
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:41:34
You dob't have to but it is highly advised to do so. Offline storage is always a better option if storing for any period of time.

So awesome. Thanks for the video
