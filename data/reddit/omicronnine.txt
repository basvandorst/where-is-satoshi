By what measure, though? You still haven't answered the question.

My basic assertion can be found two comments up the thread:


I also never said, or even implied "unrestrained market", nor did I ever even say that capitalism is a good thing.
I don't know who you thought you were replying to, but it doesn't seem to be me.
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:19:29
You seem to be describing what has been happening more recently, as we've moved *away* from capitalism towards state protectionism.
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:57:24
True, but my comment didn't mention anything about goodness, nor does your reply address the question of success or failure.
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:58:14
You didn't actually answer my question...
@_date: 2014-12-15 11:01:54


No, it was not.
If I am wrong, then please link to the comment where that question appears.


Nor did I label it a success, merely the most successful of the forms.


The question I asked was: "By what measure does capitalism fail?"
And through all these replies you have yet to be able to give a single *specific* answer to the one question I asked. I will reply to this thread when you give one, but until then I'm not interested in wasting my time. Have nice day.

By what measure does capitalism fail? As far as I can tell, it's *the most successful system of all time*, by far.
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:00:35
I would say that full-filling purpose and/or meeting goals would be a very good measure of success. The primary purpose/goal of capitalism is generation of profit, and I think few would argue that it has indeed generated unprecedented amounts of profit.
There is a more basic measure, though: capitalism has dominated and displaced almost all other economic systems on the face of the earth, and even in those places where it has not totally displaced other systems (e.g. China, North Korea), it nevertheless holds great sway, whether the local government accepts it or not.
@_date: 2014-12-15 07:58:07
Pretty much, yeah.
Calling that a failure of capitalism is not accurate, though. It's the result of the failure to *protect* capitalism from those influences.
@_date: 2014-12-15 04:02:08
No real world manifestation of any system can be "true". The real world is messy.

Perhaps you should look again at what you are responding to. I never called capitalism "successful" in an absolute sense. I simply pointed out that it is the *most successful*, which is a relative comparison to the others.


Perhaps not, but I *can* say that A is the prettiest, no matter how ugly they may both in fact be. Similarly, if A is more successful then B, then A is in fact the most successful.
Now, back to the question I asked:


Ok, since you claim that it fails by *any* measure, I can choose "being capitalist" as the measure. 
Hmm... capitalism is not only the *most successful* at "being capitalist", it is also objectively successful at "being capitalist" in an *absolute* sense as well, by definition.
You are proven wrong. (Well, actually, you are proven foolish for making such a ridiculous sweeping claim.)

Yes, thank you Sir Joke Killer of Seriouston.

Oh god yes.
Real 100% grass fed beef tastes vastly better then the mass produced corn fed crap. I can't afford it more then once in a blue moon, but I do love it so. :)

Or, if you're European, you just... don't. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:50:02
Wow, that's a... really bad idea.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:45:47
Not from the looks of it. Count on at least 90 days.

Does speaking of both dollars and cents confuse people?
