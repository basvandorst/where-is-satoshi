I have a thought regarding the shift that is gonna come to crypto. From my point of view not all coins will go up again like in the past, we will reach 1’trillion marketcap most likely but this is the thing, what if the big institutions and companies will make their own blockchain projects with only private sales not open for the public? And over night we will see a coin that will be worth 100 billion dollars in marketcap? Do you think this will be the shift? And not big companies buying from the market? It is clear the this market will become harder and harder to understand as time goes by, bcs experienced people that missed out on crypto they want in and they will do anything possible to cheat the line,and as we know the market works the money flows from the many to the few.
