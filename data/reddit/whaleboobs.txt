Seems like the smartest thing to do as a seller is to use the next largest market.

Sites without interactions (no server-side language) are not hackable.
Well made websites which get pen tested don't get hacked. Mt.Gox was made poorly, the CEO in a interview didnt sound very technical/smart when he described how the website was coded.
There are example websites which claims to be unhackable and they even encourage people to try to hack them for a reward. 
You are somewhat right tough, TONS of websites just doesnt care about security or doesnt know better.

A normal star can create elements up to iron(?) and to get higher elements you will need a supernova. The point at where a star turns in to a supernova is when its so dense it collapses on to itself. It overcomes some kind of force at the molecular level. (The weak or strong force?). When the supernova explodes these elements are scattered around the universe.
No idea how rare it is

If i were Ulbricht and had a bunch of BTC backed up (a thousand or so) i would use these to buy myself stuff inside the prison. Just like in The Wire he could buy food, games and even an aquarium.

We can never know for sure but read the public papers about it (posted 6 months ago or so here on reddit)
They found key files on the computer. He saved the private keys in a file on the harddrive, iirc it was named something obvious like "mysecret.key". The papers tells he stored a lot of "stupid" stuff on his computer. He would be fine if he had just encrypted the whole computer with a dead mans switch around his wrist.. :(

it always feels better knowing someone else has it worse. I got donated 2 BTC on just-dice and gambled it all away with martingale. then deposited 0.2, played it up to 0.8 - was about to buy a HTC smartphone on  but forgot to check if user was "authenticated" and got scammed on thoose 0.81!
