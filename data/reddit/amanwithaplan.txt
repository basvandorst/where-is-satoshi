Excellent reply, thank you!
So one private key can be linked to multiple public addresses?  I suppose wallets manage all the public addresses, and at one time show you your "balance" by summing the balance of all the public addresses attached to your private key?   What happens If I want to send 10 BTC to someone, and two of my addresses contain 5 BTC each, so I send two transactions signed with the same public key?
Thanks again for your helpful answer!

I'm glad you took time to post this Saturday morning to remind yourself of how much of a jerk you are.  I'm actually looking for meaningful answers, or links where I can read some more like cedobor, if you have nothing useful to say, don't post.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:31:15
Thanks cedobor, I tried to find this info, do you by chance have any links to this info? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:01:28
Very exciting developments.  Thanks for the link!!

It was my impression that segwit doesn't decrease txn fees by that much.  Even if there was 100% adoption.

I just downloaded BLW and added funds.  I didn't touch anything else. 
Now it says it's "online", but still has the same problem. Keeps failing saying "Lightning payment failed and refunded"

Ah, thanks!!

Thanks, i'll try eclaire.  Custodial wallets make no sense... the whole point of bitcoin is to own your private keys.  It's ridiculous to me that custodial wallets are still tolerated in the cypto community.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:22:09
yes they eventually failed and refunded.
It says "online" now where it used to say "connecting to peers", and the LN payments fail instantly now "Ligtning payment failed and refunded. "

Come on, keep it... it's an interesting discussion of the technology underlying bitcoin.

Blockchain is too slow and expensive for medical records.  The distributed ledger comes at a performance cost.  A single cloud-based solution is much much much faster, cleaner, more energy efficient.  However, even a cloud-based service is too slow for the data storage and processing required in today's healthcare.  Storing images, videos, scan data etc...
We had the technology to make medical record systems where "users own the data" for a long time.  I.e. we could put it on a USB stick, or encrypt the data so that only patients can decrypt and grant access.  The problem is that it's not used.  Patients don't care too much about that, and physicians find it a pain in the butt because it's another roadblock to them accessing information to provide healthcare. 
Blockchain does not fix this problem, it would just make it more complicated.
So far all blockchains that promise to revolutionize healthcare have been ICO-scams.
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:37:50
Blockchain doesn't really solve any issues in healthcare informatics we are facing with today.  There is not much use for the super expensive, slow, bulky distributed ledger... it just adds problems rather than solves them.
The biggest use case for blockchain is actually research.  Having a distributed ledger that cannot be tampered with is very important for drug-sponsored research.  This way any data entered into the distributed database can later be independently verified to ensure research integrity, and is secured against any tampering.  Results from research tries can be COMBINED together in a meta-analysis for bigger trials without concern of "lost data".
There is a big problem with industry-sponsored research being less credible due to a vested interest in the success of their product.  They would purposefully exclude certain countries in their research sample to make the drug succeed.  
For example, research of drug called plavix in stroke prevention - Poland recruitment was very heavy and was thought to be driving the success of the trial, and the researchers excluded certain countries that showed negative results.  Blockchain would remove this issue, and would allow open independent verification of raw research results.  It would also hold researchers directly accountable for any unethical research behavior because all research behaviour (data entry) is well documented in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:28:13
yeah, I see your point. 
I wouldn't want that though.  Bc insurance companies would LOVE this.  They can go back and find medical conditions you've had, and find some pre-condition in this "permanent ledger".  THey may even mandate you to give them access if they were to give you insurance.  Say you were depressed at some point for a few months, but better now.  It will tarnish your medical records as a "psychiatric disorder" forever.  There is danger to this.

your only argument is that people who disagree with you don't understand the technology.  I'm a software programmer... I've been working with cryptography probably longer than you have been alive.   Don't use that as an argument.

We already have all this.   There is no need to throw blockchain at it. I am in healthcare informatics, and I have been trying to find blockchain solutions for a while now, so I am on your side, but this is the honest answer. 
    -A way to make transparency amongst providers, insurance and users
There is no way in hell insurance companies will want transparency b/c it will open the system to more regulation and checks/balances.  Providers don't want transparency either, b/c it will open them up to litigation... the more transparency, the more exposure healthcare providers have to litigation.  Patients would not want more transparency b/c it's all about privacy. 
    A way to track the use and distribution of drugs, such as opioids
Again, you don't need a blockchain for this.  You just need a database. 
    A way for members to own their data and allow them to access their health records and share their records with providers.
This has been attempted.  It turns out patients don't care about "owning" their data.  They just want good healthcare delivered to them.  Plus hospital corporations want to keep the data due to liability reasons (if patient discovers there is some cyst somewhere that wasn't reported in the hospital, they sue). 
    A payment system where providers are able to be paid within minutes of providing services, permissions and “prior authorizations” can be nearly instant, trust-less and near-instant
There is capacity to do that already.  The insurers or governments do not want instant payment.  They want to be able to carefully vet all finance transactions and pay bi-monthly. 
The problem with using blockchain for these things is that it's too slow.  There is no reason to have your healthcare data propagated across a distributed ledger.  A cloud-based solution makes much more sense, and various ones are under development. 
The biggest utility of blockchain, in my opinion, is research.  This would allow drug companies to run research trials, and to use blockchain as a tamper-proof permanent ledger, and nobody would be able to change the results of research studies for their benefit.  It would be open so that anyone can verify statistics behind research studies.

Bitcoin is not a stable market.  It behaves as any highly volatile entity.  Putting your savings in bitcoin is purely reckless.
I am optimistic about bitcoin as many of people are on but I am also realistic in understanding that this is a highly volatile asset that is not stabilized or protected by any mechanism.  It is highly vulnerable to price manipulation, insider trading, etc...   There are other assets that are a much better fit for what the OP is asking.
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:38:34


thanks for your help!  I'll wait.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:15:45
If it was as easy as that, you'd have free healthcare right now and there would be no need for insurance companies.

lol, just pure emotion and attacks... I have nothing to say to you except: Please invest responsibly and speak to a financial planner.  
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:35:57
OP is right, you are speculating that it will gain further adoption.
You are also speculating that someone won't continue to manipulate the price and perform insider trading to screw over people like OP.  You are simply speculating that no one will create a machine to crack bitcoin key pairs and cause its collapse, or that another currency won't suddenly predominate and cause BTC to crash.  There are other assets that are protected from this and backed by the government that would be a better bet.  
Despite having 200 billion, it is still too small, and is exposed to all illegal investment activity.  It may become a safer investment to hold value when it reaches several trillion. 
It has been said a million times, and I will say it again: Don't invest 
anything into cryptocurrencies you are willing to lose.

"you don't understand and need to do more research" is not a good defense for your argument.  It just makes you sound desperate because you ran out of supporting arguments... just sayin.

but isn't Litepay only 1% fees? instead of visa, which chargest merchants 3%?  Plus it's debit so litepay should be ok where visa isn't accepted. 
The nice thing is that you can store even more funds in litecoin, and buy with it if you need to. (as opposed to keeping most of it in fiat for day-to-day activities).
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:53:42
It actually is... It's the risk takers that crash the economy.  That includes banks that give out risky mortgages as well as rookie investors who invest their livelihood in volatile assets.  It's all gambling, just what you are doing. 
I love gambling, and I am invested in cryptocurrency as well.  But I am aware that everything in bitcoin is a gamble, and I am prepared to lose it all.
Eventually the risk builds, compounds, and crashes down, which is what happened in 2008.  Banks were bailed out, which is why people didn't end up on the streets like in 1929.

Please speak to your financial advisor.  You shouldn't be using bitcoin for your savings.  You must diversify in international markets if you want to be protected from brexit.

There are THOUSANDS of examples like this.  There are several examples of this in cryptocurrencies as well, take bitconnect for example...an extremely risky investment gone awry.  Everyone understood and believed the technology that they were proposing.
