Why on earth not? You’re obviously not...an advocate for helping others...go back to your TA charts, make a difference your own way, or just sit there angrily asking questions that have no positive answers, I won’t stop. Drop you, I’ll keep dropping that, I just popped a sprocket, Jerry. Springer. I barely know here, got that?

I have a Bitcoin QR for this too.

Who is to say that his “investment” was not actually his and someone gave him that money in order to make a convincing post to try to advertise for Segwit2x. Hmm.

Was contemplating waiting until a significant dip before the fork...I ended up buying last night when it dipped just barely below 7k; I think that was as low as it will go pre-fork...there is just too much interest and not enough bad news to keep people from buying. Also the lure of getting 2x on top of Bitcoin purchases is a powerful draw. Edit: [My cat HODLing](

True.

Just put all of my transaction history into it and it worked beautifully! Great work! :)

I understand what you mean by purchasing power, however...I don't see as blind faith, but merely understanding how a new technology works and believing in it's ability to scale. I am sure in city centers I will be able to buy a gallon of milk in less time that you think.

Bought 1 bitcoin last night at around 4800, feels good man.

Remind me when: Bitcoin crashes.

Congrats on getting some skin in the game with me! HODL'N til golden.

I bought on Wednesday night at 4800, crazy how I almost made a grand since then already. Just wow. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:14:08
I found it on amazon! Only about 1.3284 mBTC.

I will continue to hold, and I will make an investment schedule to continue riding this for a long time. I am now looking up what a commit is, thank you for expanding my knowledge and good luck with your goals!

Last night I had a feeling it was only going to go up anyways, and I might as well get some skin in this game so I bought 1 BTC...I wake up to the best news ever. I plan on holding for long term investment, but this was still a very unexpected but pleasant surprise this morning. :) I'ts not too late!
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:01:15
This.

I don't have to sell anything. I'm a HODL'N

This guy knows what's up. I still feel like a newb to be honest...in the past when bitcoin was around 600 I would only use it to make purchases, now I have a slightly different viewpoint of it. I still have to figure out the hardware wallet part and get my coins off of the exchanges. We are all still very early in this technologies adoption, even if people think it's "too late" because coins are over 5k...that's just not the case. I will hold for as long as I can.

Buy now, it’s only going to fly past the moon.
