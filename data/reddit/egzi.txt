"But if you mean if an outsider can link those HD accounts together, the answer is no, only if you transact between those HD accounts or if you send coins from the same source to those HD accounts, or when you send coins to the same destination."
Actually that is not true. HD accounts cannot be linked because there is no such thing as HD accounts on the bitcoin blockchain. HD wallet is just a way of generating bitcoin addresses and those cannot be linked to a speciffic HD wallet from the outside unless the outsider knows the HD wallet seed. Individual addresses generated by HD can be linked to an individual person by its transactions but that doesn't affect addreses not involved in linkable transactions or generated in the future by the same seed.

Use bitsquare.

It would need some more effort and it wouldn't be instant conversion, but you can easily sell bitcoins on an exchange. The fees are usually at around 0.2-0.5%. You can try bitsquare as well, it is peer to peer bitcoin exchange. Or just keep and use bitcoins.

Segwit address generation needs different algorithm, which they clearly didn't implement on their hardware. I don't see it on my computer for segwit addresses too. That's a bummer.

Another question. Cost of running network is about 5$ per transaction. It means that setting up of a channel would be 5$ if there was no mining reward and even more if bitcoin becomes more popular. How would we deal with that?

You're so wrong. How is a desktop wallet safer than a mobile wallet? I keep my private keys far away from my Windows PC. Go and find a person that newer had any viruses on his PC. On the other hand you really have to try hard to install harmfull software, say, on an android device. The only down side is that mobile client is light client, so you have to trust a third-party that it would show you correct balances of bitcoin accounts, which is hard to take advantage of if you're normal user. I kept my bitcoins on android phone for a long time. I used mycelium and jaxx. Now as my funds are way more valuable, I use jaxx on encrypted puppy linux on pendrive which i only use for managing my account. I also have my seed words engraved on metal plate (fire security) wich i keep in a safe.

The search engine is pieace of crap or I don't know how to use it even tho I am in IT profession so I guess I know how to use computer better than average person. Everything there is international, no way to find offers from my region. I really tried to find something I could actually buy but I gave up.

How do you know your TREZOR hardware is not fake?
