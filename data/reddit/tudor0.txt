What a better way to boost mass adoption?

I think because "Blockchain Flash News" :) However there's also an article if you check the description of that video

Shenzeng is part of Guangdong Province and according to wikipedia the total population was 104,303,132 in the [2010 census]( This means about 8% of the Chinese population. Also, according to wikipedia Guangdong ranks number eight as 2017 GDP per capita in the country. It might not be Beijing, but however, this news is relevant in my opinion.

More sources: 
"China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (**CIETAC**) is well known in the world. It is also the earliest and **the biggest arbitration institution in China**. CIETAC independently and impartially **resolves commercial and trade disputes** by means of arbitration.
\[...\] With its headquarters in Beijing, CIETAC also has three specialized committees, which are the Expert Consultation Committee, the Case Edition Committee and the Arbitrator Qualification Review Committee and 9 departments. **CIETAC has sub-commissions in Tianjin and Chongqing and Shenzhen**."

Hi guys, I just saw what happened here. Definitely my intention was not that of misleading. I can only say that like any human being I make mistakes. However, in spite of all this, I am happy that the community intervened and immediately corrected my mistake. In the end, in this emerging market, the community will be the basis of everything. However, I will do my best to avoid such mistakes :)

I understand your point, however we are talking about an arbitration body in China. The consequence of the decision is not limited only in that region. So that's the reason of the title.

You might be right ��

That's sad, but let's hope they will choose the right path. However, in both cases, they will help to push mass adoption as more people will get acquaintance with cryptocurrencies.

When you buy bitcoin from that ATM. You pay 10% more for each transaction

FOMO and now panic selling 
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:15:02
Yes, you have and it takes 10 minutes to do it. Then you have to wait for a SMS confirmation code (another 20 minutes). So the first time is annoying

If so, I would like to see who's connected with their lightning node channel����

I was just curious to try it. But you're right. Too expensive
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:00:38
or as an alternative investment you can buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards

Maybe he is thinking to do it after the latest denuclearization deal proposed by North Korea ����
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:33:11
That's right ��

Si giusto, sono esagerate però alemno portano le crypto anche ai potenziali utenti che magari avrebbe bisogno di una spinta in più per avventurarsi nel mondo delle crypto. Comunque non sin italiano ma la foto l'ho fatta in un centro commerciale vicino a Verona :)

The picture is from one or two weeks ago. In the meantime some friends told me about a 15% fee on a similar ATM in the same area 
@_date: 2018-07-22 12:47:50
You're right. I was curious because I was thinking to buy one. But however 10% fee is to much
