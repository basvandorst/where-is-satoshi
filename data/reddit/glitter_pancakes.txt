Fantastic news. I'm still waiting to hear back from them and my husband is making another request for something more "bank-like." Thanks so much!

I agree. It would make sense. We've shown the wire transfers and details from our bank side, but the underwriter is requiring something from Gemini to show name, social security number, account number, etc etc on one report "thing". Basically what one would expect from a traditional bank account statement which Gemini doesn't appear to have, aside from the spreadsheets which might still work. I'm still waiting to hear back from Gemini support. 
We're going to show what we have through Gemini's dashboard, those spreadsheets for example, in person later today to see if the transaction report will be enough. Fingers crossed it is. Thanks for your response.

Unfortunately, they refused flat out. They wouldn't even let us get a letter from Gemini support to see whether it worked.

You would think so, but they refused. They wouldn't even consider getting a letter from Gemini support at all.

Sure, we *could*. But we have enough "other" assets to continue with our current lender who had the best rates and we really enjoy our mortgage guy. It's just that pesky underwriter and guidelines that are the problem in this case. Their refusal to use anything related to Gemini only delays us by time on the earlier closing date we requested. So not much of a biggie for us. And thanks for continuing to offer suggestions.
I only wanted to put this out there for anyone looking for help in dealing with mortgages and bitcoin, or at least Gemini specifically. With that in mind, Gemini support did respond: **Unfortunately, we do not yet provide official account statements. We're working to incorporate this feature into our platform and hope to offer it soon.** Maybe they'll get it finished soon for others to avoid this issue in the future. ;)

Bummer. We're still hoping to not need to go that route and have a meeting with the lender this afternoon to determine if the transaction activity Gemini shows will be enough. It's a little different in our case since we're not using money from *selling* Bitcoin. We simply wire transferred the money from bank account to Gemini for holding months ago, then wired it back recently to help with our down payment, which meant it was never used for cryptocurrency and acted more like a bank account. But we're looking into those "gift" options on the side in case it doesn't work out for us to use that Bitcoin.
Glad it worked out for you in the end. It's definitely frustrating how much "proof" they are needing these days.

Agreed. Maybe even point out that **any large deposits, especially cash** are also problematic. Get it into the accounts to avoid it showing on the 2 current statements they request. 
We weren't "allowed" to use cash from the sale of a vehicle either, even with all the legal documentation. They wanted to see the *buyer's* bank account statements and that wasn't even a guarantee, because *if* the buyer had large deposits they would need to prove that, too. Kind of ridiculous the underwriter even suggested that, who would give that kind of info to a stranger? ��
Edit: Legal documentation being a copy of the title, the bill of sale, copies of the ads we used to sell the vehicle, and NadaGuides/Kelley Blue Book value estimates. The problem was the "cash" in this case, they wanted a check/money order/wire transfer/etc.

Same here. I'm going through the same issue trying to prove a Gemini account. How did yours end up, if you don't mind me asking?
