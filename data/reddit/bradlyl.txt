Couldn’t agree more! So humbling, to see that people’s minds can work in this fashion.

I would HIGHLY recommend you research DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging), specifically, in comparison to your approach of going “all-in”. Good luck, and congrats on your investment!

Not if he paid $30 Million for the coins, initially.

“Not it he started with 30k in the beginning”
@_date: 2019-03-26 10:09:52
I’ve read your whole post and I genuinely don’t know....
Do you realize you can buy any denomination of BTC? Like...you didn’t have to buy “1 BTC”. In your post you make it seem like you “missed your chance”, but why not just buy .5 BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-19 18:15:31
I literally said “Not if he paid $30 Million for them”
And you’re saying it’s “pretty obvious” that a reasonable response to that is “not if he started with 30k” 
Dude....that’s completely illogical?

Since you’re new, do yourself a favor and do some more research. Shilling your shitcoin on a comment that has NOTHING to do with what this discussion about, is a sure fire way to look illegitimate as hell.

This is 100000% true and a shame that more don’t know. 
I’ve petitioned that r/BTC be more transparent about their clear hatred for actual bitcoin, and was subsequently banned for being “critical of Roger Ver”
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:53:13
Lol....I’ve also been banned. My ban was for reminding people of Roger Ver’s involvement with NAGA coin.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:33:29
Spot on! I made the mistake of helping to make others aware of “NAGA coin” (one of Roger Ver’s many projects -AKA scam), and as soon as I mentioned it I was banned.
It’s pretty obvious there’s a team of moderators helping to cover up Rogers shady past.
Specifically, with the NAGA coin - it ICO’d as a basic advertisement that Roger Ver was their leader. As soon as the ICO ended, and the project became a flop, any association to Ver has been abandoned (seemingly as an attempt to cover his shady involvement). 
But, NAGA is just one of many examples of Ver doing shady shit like this.

You can literally do that. The name of the subreddit often does not describe the content. ( r/marijuanaenthusiasts &amp; r/trees )

Because they can’t afford to buy any gold. Otherwise, this is exactly how central banks begin.
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:07:16
In that regard I do agree with you. I more meant how it began. I suppose your correct, the rhetoric on that sub has largely devolved to meaningless FUD posts.

@_date: 2019-08-19 15:50:41
You will get banned. This is nothing new to them.
@_date: 2019-08-19 13:50:09
It’s not....it’s about shilling the hard fork of BTC. It was hastily taken over by Roger Ver and his hoard of groupies. Now, they use it as a way to trick others into thinking they are somehow “the real vision of bitcoin”.
BCash is legit, their online presence is a tragedy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:03:11
Unfortunately, you are incorrect. There is a fixed supply of 21,000,000 BTC. So the calculation of value is fairly simple...
(100 million * $1000) / 21 million BTC = $4,761.00
Edit: Good thing there is 7.4 Billion people on earth :) 
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:51:52
Just do some basic research yourself? Look at post history’s of the mods, look at ban history’s, deleted posts, etc.
If you need real life testimonials, I was personally banned from r/BTC for criticizing Roger Ver.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:58:49
I did not say that. And, I am not a professional financial advisor. PLEASE do not take my investment strategy as anything more than exactly what it is...MY investment strategy. :) Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:37:10
Sure! My investment strategy is very simple when it comes to my cryptocurrencies portfolio...
When I see an alt coin that is backed by good tech and developers that seem to have the right interest in long term implementation, I invest a small amount of my BTC returns. 
As my BTC has seen huge fluctuations, my overall portfolio always grows (as the crypto market grows as a whole) while all currencies go up and down dramatically on any given day, I just hold steady with my initial feelings about the investments.  The idea here, no matter where the money is moving on a given day, I'm taking advantage of the larger picture, which is the consistent influx of money being poured into crypto. 
Here's my portfolio breakdown: 
BTC- 42.62%
Bcash- 22.69%
IOTA- 6.24%
Ripple- 5.81%
Ether- 5.45%
Aidos Kuneen- 4.4%
NEO- 3.13%
Best of luck!!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:33:14
You will....just be patient! My first buy of btc was at 300 and I thought I was making a likely mistake. $5 from every paycheck just a couple years later...and I may be looking at a nice little nest egg in the future

You could also use this formula that u/biologischeavocado seems to prefer :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:56:51
You sir....are correct :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:08:30
I can relate to that! But, investing and math go hand-in-hand :) 
If you don't have a traditional business school education to learn the formulaic equations that support finance (most don't), you can actually yield pretty good information through google. While i do have a BA, I still find myself researching a lot of the technical mathematics behind finance. 
TL/DR - it makes EVERYONE nervous 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:52:37
Sure! its a very basic function of compounding interest. In this scenario, the nT (time) variable is a factor of 2 weeks.
A = P (1+r/n)^nt
a= amount
P= Principal
r= interest rate 
n= number of times compounded per period
nt= time intervals

What is your exact definition of an “early adopter”? When was this 500$ spent? 
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:53:17
No one was paying $500 for BTC....NO ONE.
“SmokeToMuch” even famously auctioned 10,000 BTC for $50 USD in 2009/10. No takers.
@_date: 2019-04-01 13:57:22
You’re lying. Bitcoin didn’t even have value “when it launched” and wasn’t traded until it arrived on BitcoinMarket.com.
At THAT time...you’re $500 purchase would have amounted to 160,000 + BTC
That’s a current value of $640,000,000....
And you say you don’t care? Sorry homie...cool story but I don’t believe you

Friend- I implore you to re-read the post and the comment I left you. I'm afraid your reading them with the wrong narrative in mind. Was just seeking some help from anyone helpful enough to answer. Happy HODL'ing!

Honestly, I have no idea! I don't know much about the back-end processes. I'm not farmilar with what can cause a xfer to take so long. But, it is concerning that a simple xfer between wallets can take that long. Very concerning for the eventual mass scaling of BTC/BCC.
@_date: 2017-07-28 15:46:33
Thanks so much for finding this! Really helpful!
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:58:00
Do you by chance have a source for this? I'd love to find out more but can't find any info other than a FAQ on coinbase that says they can't do anything unless it's sent to an email address.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:57:11
This is interesting! I couldn't find any info about this! Source? I'd love to know more about it!
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:02:52
Your thoughts are the exact same as mine! 
I was xfering over to my new wallet address from my phone, while I had the address of my new wallet in which I was sending to on my computer screen. I was very deliberate in checking each input 2-3 times. Then when I got to end of the address I pressed send. (No issues)
I noticed that it stayed pending for about 15 min, checked back a half hour later, still pending...decided to verify the addresses, when I noticed that the address it was sent to added **"4ry"** to the end of the address. I still dont know why or how, I was assuming it was some kind of auto correct.
Today I woke up to an email that the transaction was completed and the funds are in my new wallet. No idea how or what happened, but as you can imagine am extremely relieved!
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:17:33
Interesting set of personal values you have my friend: value the information you get out of a question...but hate on the person who actually asked it. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:56:28
Turns out, I lucked out! Still not sure what happened, but I wont make the mistake of not copy/pasting any transfers again!
