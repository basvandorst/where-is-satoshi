I think there's plenty of room for innovation. At this point, though, it seems likely that it will be built by or on top of (e.g. layer 2) one of the major existing projects.

Thanks for the encouragement!


I agree with this whole heartedly and want to help address it!

Huh- not sure this would be a common need, but it would certainly be interesting!

I overall agree with your arguments, it's just a precipitous situation for the market to be in. Sure, Bitmain is a business. But what about the Chinese government to whom they answer? What if the party decides BTC is a threat to China's fiscal sovereignty, for example? It's worrisome, at the very least.

ah yes that settles that...

I certainly hope you're right. The recent "State of Cryptocurrency Mining" post (which is quoted and linked to in this article) paints a much bleaker picture. Bitmain seems both highly competent and ruthless. Their hold on the production of ASICs may last a bit longer than one would think.

It really depends on how deep you want to go! Like most things, it can get incredibly intricate or relatively approachable depending on what you want to do and the path you take. My hope is to make things more on the approachable side, especially for self taught folks. If you'd like to follow along, check out

That's not even remotely close to my point! Please give the post an actual read. It's meant to be an exhortation to the Bitcoin community to embrace the full potential Bitcoin has, rather that to be narrow-minded about it's potential.
