He has one that I have yet to hear an answer to... Bitcoin has no intrinsic value and therefore can never be money
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:17:27
there have been many currencies used throughout history ( 1000's maybe? ).  To say that none of them were designed to be used as pure money is pretty unbelievable tbh.

Just define intrinsic value first and see how and see how absurd your claim that, "nothing really has intrinsic value", is.

So it has no objective value because the drowning man says so?
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:08:52
So water has no objective value then?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:08:04
Oh really?  Give me a definition of intrinsic value that excludes everything in the world
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:20:11
history does not support your claim that the best money has no intrinsic value, in fact it has shown the opposite to be true.  If bitcoin can successfully overcome the intrinsic value barrier it would be the first currency in human history to do so.

"The value of a thing is a function of its utility as appraised by a person". That's a good definition of subjective value.  Is your definition for "objective value" the same as "subjective value", or is do you not have a definition for "objective value"?

Measurement is a function of the human mind.  Your definition is self contradictory.  You're trying to use a function of the human mind to qualify something that is supposed to exist without the human mind

Appeal to complexity and authority are not rational arguments.
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:18:26
You have just described confirmation bias which is not a rational position to hold... and you're proud of it?  GTFOOH

So now I'm supposed to provide an example of a term that you can't define?
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:34:08
When you are going short you are essentially saying that the price will go down in the long term.  When you are going long you are saying the price will go up long term.  If I wanted to short Bitcoin I would borrow $4000 from someone who had Bitcoin and then I would buy the Bitcoin from them in the future with the money they loaned me.  So if Bitcoin goes to $2000 by the time I have to buy it from them I make $2000.  If Bitcoin is $6000 by the time I have to buy it from them I lose $2000.

A fiat currency is backed by government force, you go to jail for not using or accepting it
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:57:28
In general Bitcoin is not used as a currency.
