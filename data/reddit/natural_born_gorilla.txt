When the only proof, without a hackers dump on pastebin, is what the CEO tells you, proof is kinda irrelevent. They did the right thing in a password reset, but they got hacked. Come on.


Yeah server logs. Dont they all? Again, they did good actually analysing them regularly. But it didn't stop the site getting breached.
They're not to blame for the bitcoinica hack, not even remotely suggesting that, and i agree they handled it well (lastpass i mean, last year) - but it just struck me as a wierd scenario. Suspicious. Its plausible this news today was some master hack on the informational par of Oceans 11, but its also plausible it was a well thought out ruse by bitcoinica to steal all of your monehs.

I am not a speculator/investor/saver. Just a fan/nerd who hopes to see bitcoin growing into a paypal rival one day. I bought some at its lowest, have spent half, and the other half is now worth the same i paid for both halves. Kinda cool, but i wish i had bought more now, for a store with a projected (lol joking here dont flame) 200% APR ROI :P
Now i have seen how volatile (been here since before the original bubble, before the gawker article) it is and i *know* to see this as folly. But does a newbie?
So, that being a given (the answer is no, the newbie wont see the risk *as* much, and the ROI looking damned likely atm) - speculation for a store of money that returns (not a currency to spend thus generating *real* value) is probably the main reason why we got a spike in price.
Just my ฿0.02...

Building a faraday cage that would work would cost a lot of money. Its not the same as safely [conducting electricity away]( like a big cage - with killing radio/EM leakage its got to be an extremely fine copper mesh attached to a frame without any minute gaps (a skilled craftsperson ensuring the corners are tight).
Even then, as an example, if you put a phone in 3-5 anti-ESD bags, you will still probably be able to call the phone and it will ring. Sensitive devices do well against shielding.

If you want to keep your host machine secure for things like the bitcoin client, or banking/sensitive logins in general; use a virtual machine exclusively for browsing. Never browse outside of it. You switch on the machine, then you switch on the virtual machine, full-screen it and forget you're not directly on the host machine.
Especially if you reddit. When you understand the process of designing a malware attack embedded within some form of content/media that would appeal to your victim (social engineering) - reddit is a great recruitment ground for infecting machines. Create content tailored for a subreddits interests and post. Half the SE works done for you, like going fishing in a fish farm.
Even if you're smart - and your machine is 'well protected', i bet once a week you still click something you really thought you shouldn't have in a moment of impatience - AV can often be *worthless*, and users are fallible, you included. A VM is the only safe way to surf.

Sounds really fucking convoluted. But... In the age of bitcoin we have computing technology that could back this high-level of computation such a system would require... Conveniently, transparently, automatically. 


Was it buddha or just the present dalai lama who said humans are inherently altruistic. I dont believe that for a minute, but society has enough re-inforcement of altruism evolved into it to make that a general rule. 


Sounds like a step-up from Spain's system as it stands today.

It would be one way to reverse the impending *Idiocracy* that welfare systems assist in creating, but without it there would be no police either and no police + absence of welfare seems like a recipe for the more anarchy style of anarchy, rather than the idea of anarchy as a factor you build more of into the existing systems (rather than having no systems altogether and social chaos).
I'm playing devils advocate here a little, explain where i'm wrong or how anarcho-capitalists address these arguments against it.

tl;dr If your password wasn't complex, it was bruteforceable offline. If they used Lastpass in the past and then never changed the identical gox pass since - then that data could have, through a concerted reconnaissance effort to piece various known identities, vectors and dumped/hacked/purchased data together, been used to compromise the mtgox account. Its the kind of thing hacker gangs would do to all the time on many targets simultaneously, not just bitcoin banks but anything that will keep them in the money.
Then again it could be a ruse, an excuse, plausible deniability.

Cool, i like the idea of smaller plays anyway, i like red/black odd/even gambling, nothing too racy/risky, but in casinos they make this very expensive per bet to keep small-spenders at bay so the drunks can find a spot.

As important a question, how would anyone else? I'm guessing this is like being a Tor Relay, or i2p or freenet routers, you relay millions of partial fragments of encrypted and anonymized traffic. This will undoubtedly as the hours tick by contain fragments of data you would rather not assist in its transit. But if you want to use a resilient crypto network, the fact criminals are using it should be an indicator of its security.

You can buy with cash; vouchers from electronic paypoints in your corner shops you pay your bills/top up your phone at, and those vouchers numbers are accepted by some folk on the bitcoin-otc. So i read a while back, its hazy now, so do some reasearch.
If you want to anonymise your BTC wherever or however you get them, you can use services like the bitcoin fog on Tor, they take a cut but tumble your coins.

@_date: 2012-08-04 15:53:46
LOL That does seem to sound like what is written there.
The way i read it sounded like the opposite of Tor; no IP anonymity, but encrypted traffic. Like Bitcoin has no IP anonymity. I think it means outside of the tunnel everything is encrypted, not inside, otherwise you'd have nothing but digital white noise for content. :)
@_date: 2012-08-04 16:56:51
So its like todays existing darknets, but theres an extra layer protecting you from illegal content. Thats a major turn-off for a lot of people in checking out hidden services on Tor and eepsites on i2p and such; being web 2.0 theres a risk of you viewing illegal content on *some* websites (anti-CP imageboards like Torchan, are still not immune, unlike e.g. Torbook which is text-only). 
This darknet would allow you to avoid that variable, by all content being encrypted as standard. This could be a really great darknet, i will keep my eyes on this project, hope it gets mainstream attention.
@_date: 2012-07-14 09:23:29

I really hope there is some mining revolution that stabilises bitcoin. Even if it makes it worth less in the short to medium term. 
I never wanted to make money out of bitcoin (even though i know just fine i could have made a couple grand by now if i had got involved in that way). Yet, i wouldn't mind losing small amounts over time if it was still part of a long slow move paired with the continued progress of bitcoin as an evolving ecosystem.

These are the most interesting of all. Its utterly indelible.

Really great show, first time i've heard it, thanks for posting.
The talk about the "threat" posed by bitcoin, or just decentralised currency, there being a risk to taxation (*we* know it will never replace nation states currencies) was very interesting. I had never thought of that as a reason why the *Man* would attack the currency.
But with the talk of the banks being more exposed to collapse, the prospect of the "death and taxes" adage being halved to merely; "death" is quite an interesting one.
Does that sum up Anarcho-capitalism? The elimination of taxes would be the ultimate capitalist social structure, with no free education, medicine, etc... and the decentralised nature of the currency being the anarchic element...
