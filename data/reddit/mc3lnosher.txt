When half of everybody is saying its tulips and prepare for the crash, I hope you didn't buy enough to lose sleep over. That being said hodl till you make money, if you can. Bitcoin can be up big, down big, but in the long run it mostly just goes up.

The new tax bill says you can't convert it for free real soon. Don't take advice from 1 string of comments, one sub, or one website for that matter. Do your due diligence. Don't put more in than your comfortable losing. Don't overreact to all the drama. Bitcoin IS drama. That's part of what fuels it.

When you call anything over a 1% drop a panic or crash every single day while its up astoundingly over the last year, you lose credibility.

You ignore the discussion on here advocating for the awareness of the context of the situation. Because nothing major has happened for a while, people shouldn't discuss anything?
@_date: 2018-09-24 22:14:54
Sure. That and the coming global recession.

Lots of kids would get it. Many adults stopped learning decades ago.

It seems like we're on the same page so I don't know what there is to discuss.

What's the best way we can fight back?

Your stomach will gain fortitude. You will look back upon your early purchases with fondness.

LUL. Sub 1000 dollar coins wouldn't stay on the shelf, you're deluded.

If you're holding any part of the dip or even an ATH are great times to buy some. I just buy 20-50$ whenever I feel like it. HODL.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:09:21
Discount today only probably

Like there hasn't been a run on the exchanges in the last few months?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:38:23
Sure this run has been crazy, but if you don't snag coins at 2-3k after it hits 10 you're the crazy one.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:24:34
I'm probably buying 20+coins at 200$. But I'm not holding my breath.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:21:22
Just bear in mind you could go negative during a dip for a while, but zoom out and look at what happens after every dip. Dollar cost average is amazing though. I haven't broke 1500.00 yet.

Why is your crystal ball better than others? You may be right... But you may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:48:32
I wouldn't but they are your coins to protect. Choose wisely.

Big if true.
