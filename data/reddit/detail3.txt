Correct, I totally misunderstood. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:45:15
This is how I'm viewing it...however I'm actually counting any gains as unrealized until/if I cash out in fiat (meaning pull money from an exchange to my bank account).  As things are all so grey, if they don't tell me what to do I can't be expected to write the books on my own taxes.
I would also image Gox would legally have to provide you with a csv or something, those are easy to work with. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:31:13
Yes, I agree completely.

Is this essentially somebody washing their dirty BTC clean?
@_date: 2013-05-04 05:40:27
A moderately large government could instantly dedicate some portion of its computing power toward mining bitcoin, subsequently control 51% of the network and fork it at will.  This would, in effect, destroy confidence in bitcoin.  They wouldn't have to make it illegal. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:09:57
Interesting that nobody has thought that perhaps miners may need to sell off their newly minted BTC in order to pay for their expensive ASIC devices quickly...this would drive the price down.
But realistically, ASIC's mining has no overall net effect upon the price of bitcoin.  There would at best be a very loose correlation between the two...network security...meh...maybe.  But you could also argue a less secure network due to consolidation of ASIC mining farms or ASminer's hashrate; centralization in other words.

Nominal interest rate = Actual interest Rate + Inflation
Most Nominal (named) interest rates for Savings accounts are ~1% (being generous).
Inflation holds steady historically at about 3% in the United States of America.
1% = Actual Interest Rate + 3%
-2% = Actual Interest Rate
So you actually lose 2% on your money in a Savings account.  So its a safe bet, yeah.  To lose 2% annually in the best case scenario if inflation holds steady amid increasing spending.
Having said that...losing 2% is better than losing everything of course.  It is a risky investment as of now.  Its speculation based upon future use and value.  
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:20:37
Hmm....yeah I guess I actually disagree with those points.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:33:27
Its undecided.  Companies will look to where the money is...always...after all, they have to Net profits.  Low/non-existent transaction fees are obviously a plus, a company like Amazon could instantly shave 3% off of their gross profits...that's nothing to sneeze at when dealing in the billions.
People are waiting to see how it shakes out imo.  BTC is pretty volatile as of now and that probably carries some risk/complications.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:58:52
This actually sounds right to me, but why doesn't every large BTC movement come across as one like OP posted?  Not every large account is moving 100% of their coins at once.

Josh made a bet with a user on bitcointalk that they could in fact produce the promised hashrate with the quoted power usage....the bet was for 1,000 BTC.  This was Josh who lost the bet, and actually owed the user...looks like he found a way to shade around it.

@_date: 2013-04-29 21:28:45
That is how I am viewing it at the moment.
Note to readers, if you are purchasing cryptocurrencies for a long position it would be wise to do so within the confines of a self-directed IRA custodian.  
Then you pay ZERO taxes on things.  If you wait until retirement to withdraw, ofc.  Just something to think about. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 07:02:07
Yes.  I'm very freaked out by it, I'm very worried about the 'players' involved in bitcoin now, I'm very worried that any ideology behind bitcoin is being left behind and I'm worried that frankly if the big banks come on board then bitcoin is fucked.
Holders will profit, but if that is what bitcoin is about now...ugh.  I think people should realize that senators aren't suddenly 'coming around', that just doesn't happen in this world.  
Idk...I guess the bitcoin devs aren't instituting things now that are bad for bitcoin, but those things are being discussed as you all know...I really wonder what's going on behind the scenes as of now.  None of this really makes any sense to me, and that usually means that strange things are going on.  
Its not like the gov't simply decided they couldn't stop bitcoin...I mean, even if they couldn't...and that's an extreme thing to think that the full resources of the US gov't would pale compared to what bitcoin could present (just being realistic)...its not like the US gov't is afraid of fighting battles it can't win, hell just look at the world.  
Something's fucked up here.
Hopefully I'm just being paranoid, idk....but it looks like I'm far from the only one thinking these things.  
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:57:46

Plus when they try to buy things based not Upon the dollar bad things happen, like an embargo of Iran (who decided to try to sell oil to China based on their currency...coincidentally right around that time)

Good points, but at the end of the day if Amazon wants to profit, which they obviously do, they will move toward the money and not throw their own good after bad (their currency).

Yeah...not sure about the fighting for upvotes based upon age, but certainly the quality of the argument/statement should be taken into consideration...the reality is that oftentimes I have to 'show hidden comments' to get the best information in the thread.  Its shameful.

I like the concept of bitmit, but it really doesn't work for me.  In your shoes I'd try to just sell it on bitcointalk.  Having said that, if you have a local offer, jump on it, very little risk with that.
eBay may cancel your account and the auction for accepting BTC, but who cares
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:29:26
Honestly, MtGox has lag issues....that and the dependency for it from the BTC community is 'too damn high'...so if it goes offline or gets attacked, BTC slows.  I see those as the issues. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:09:06
I also can confirm a wholly positive experience there (except they sell out of coins too quick when the price is low!).

@_date: 2013-04-29 17:07:45
Its sort of a grey area as of now, honestly.  Are miners actively 'creating' the good through the act of mining or are they 'employees' of the Bitcoin network being paid for their hashing services.  If the former then they are classified as exchangers and if the latter then they are classified as users under FinCen.
I think when it all settles it will be the latter that reigns.  
To those that don't know, the issue is exchanging fiat for cryptocurrency, some places obviously do this (exchanges) but with miners who sell their earned coins for fiat, its more of a grey area. 
edit: of course, profits are profits and subject to taxation no matter what...I was speaking about regulations the miner would have to comply with. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:22:49
I guess my point is that assuming they bring credibility to an area that is looking for it would be a hell of an assumption...they may or may not, but its not that cut and dry.  
I don't really care much about important one way or another, but if their value is in their notoriety then I think its a negative value, yes.  I don't think they are going to talk about the technical side of Bitcoin, of course...I would think there are hundreds of people more qualified to do that.  So then, if they are speaking based upon 'fame' or as vetted investors then yes, I think its a point worth addressing.
Is any attention good attention?  I don't know...I mean, if the IRS brings attention is that good attention?  If silk road gets more attention is that good attention?  Perhaps either way, but its not obviously positive. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:55:44
Nope, not translating it, just upvoting. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 22:47:48
I think the issue is more one concerning how difficult it is to really compile the information that you need to know at this point...that is to say you still have to dig around a bit to find out about Bitcoin, at least to understand it as well as most of us would like to. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:01:29

@_date: 2013-04-03 15:39:46
I agree.  Of course, the perceived risk is also created by you...we all have some idea of how 'risky' of an investment a Bitcoin is that is not identical to another perception of risk.  What is rational to me may not be to you...its all relative. I don't see Bitcoin as a lottery ticket after all. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:38:09
FinCen classifies what cryptocurrency actually is and has to do with regulatory bodies.  IRS gets paid, you are correct, they are the people you need to appease.

@_date: 2013-04-16 04:35:42
Likely your bank will cover the difference if its within their overdraft limit (don't know how low your funds are)...then you'll be charged a NSF (non-sufficient funds) fee and have to pay that back to your bank.  That is the most likely scenario, but it depends upon your financial institution as they all vary at least slightly. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 23:48:39
That's sort of the rub I'm talking about, a lot of people involved with bitcoin are really, really, really smart and don't have much of an idea about what is going on.  Every time I think I get it I once again find out that I'm one of the people who have no idea what is going on ;)

right, but then whomever could also d/l and run the new code again and again.
And a deliberate, successful attack is more scary to holders than an accident that can be corrected. 
I'm not trolling here, I am a Bitcoin holder, but the network is nowhere near as big as people seem to think it is by comparison with national governments.  If for whatever reason some large entity in the world decides that Bitcoin has to go, they can make it go.  That's just the current reality.

High Risk = High Reward.  All investments are purely speculative by nature.  If you believe that inflation of fiat currency will stay at ~3% then perhaps Bitcoin are not a good investment, but as of now in Iran for example inflation (by a conservative estimate) is ~30% per year....people want a non-inflationary currency, Bitcoin can provide that.  I've been concerned about hyper-inflation for years and Bitcoin can solve that problem for me.  
Risky yes.  Bubble, yes...when?  Who knows?  However, as a LONG term investment I like Bitcoin.  Now, I'm not putting any funds that would destroy me if I lost them into it...but that's just my risk-avoidance behavior and nature.  Others prefer a greater risk...personally, I think Bitcoin is actually LESS risky that many traditional alternatives due to global spending increases which really have no realistic end in sight.  
I'm not a Bitcoin junky injecting it into my veins like others here...but I can see them going to $10,000 in a decade or so.  Part of me can also see it crashing wholly and failing...but that's why you diversify your investments.  To protect against market and company-specific risks.  Bitcoin is trading well above its value right now, but use will catch up in time....I think ;)
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:03:17

He also reworked the actual code for CGminer to make it appear as though he wrote a lot more code than he actually did.  Kano was the actual author of said code.  Luke Jr. is pretty shady.

You pay taxes on earned revenue and you pay taxes on any realized gains exchanging the currency.  'options'?

@_date: 2013-04-28 05:41:04
Yes, if they wanted to then the U.S. government could instantly carry out a 51% attack on the network, don't underestimate the processing power of the U.S. government.  In reality it wouldn't even have to be the U.S., many major world governments would have the processing power to do just what we are talking about here.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 02:14:05

They also aren't 'not okay' with it. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:35:57
He claims that he actually wrote the code for CGminer, but he didn't (according to Kano).  He somehow altered the time stamp or something on Github so it looks like he authored (many) more of the lines of code than he actually did (taking the credit from Kano ((who doesn't really care))).  
IIRC it now show him as having written a large portion of the code, but in reality it was more like five lines.  So you'll find a lot of beef between these guys.  
@_date: 2013-06-03 01:51:57
No, I'd sell it within the next weeks before the Avalon Chips hit.  I'm not saying that your unit would cease to be profitable at that point by any means, but what you can likely get for it now, well you'd mine a year to make that.  With the money from the sale you can likely go ahead and buy 3-4x the hash power (easy) set for delivery in a few months from the sale (maximum)...seems like a win win.

The more logical conclusion is zero coins for the party doing what you are describing.  Taking your train of thought to infinity the one entity will either hold 100% of BTC or none...but the none is much more likely.

to even make a difference it would have to be every major government.  If, for example, Argentina does not outlaw BTC but EVERY other country in the world does...many companies will operate out of Argentina through BTC and ship anonymously worldwide.
A pedantic example, sure, but its true.
I think what you are proposing is impossible.  Global cooperation on a scale that we have yet to see...yeah, governments fear BTC could influence their revenue steam (taxes and other garbage) but outlawing something that has this kind of a foothold...think prohibition, but on a global scale...there will be a market.

Well, my personal feelings aside, their investment history has been less than stellar and their personal behavior has been called into question many times as well.  They aren't the 'elite investors' that so many on this reddit seem to wish they were, and I don't feel they add much credibility.  
I guess in the end that's just my opinion on the matter and to each his own.

They have to wait until your money clears your bank to send you the coins.  Hence the waiting period.

This is true, they likely reserve the right to cancel any order or to do business with whomever they choose; however these exchanges on public forums really are over the top and embarrassing as hell.  I for one, will never deal with BFL simply because of Josh's behavior.  I don't think I'm alone, and now that other companies are coming up there is little incentive to deal with BFL given their history and outright disdain for their customers.

I'm sure this is what she was instructed to do by her superior, who likely was instructed by somebody else.  The reality is if it was a true blackline they would blacklist terms like Bitcoin and they wouldn't be in advertisements or listings at all.  
People are having problems, don't get me wrong, and accounts are even being closed over bitcoin related things, I'm just not ready to admit that Ebay has declared war on bitcoin, I think they just don't care about it and don't want to deal with the hassle.
I mean, you can still purchase BFL with paypal on their site, ultimately if they can profit off of it, they will.  I think bitcoin related scams on Ebay are just a huge percentage of Bitcoin related things on Ebay.

I hope people heed this advice...as soon as a gain is realized, its taxable...tax evasion is....frowned upon and will bring any and all governments down HARD upon Bitcoin.  
As of now I'm assuming?  that realized gains on bitcoins are taxed as a capital gain?  I know its hazy.  I would actually like more information on this if anybody knows it...or a link to said information.

It means that as of now Bitcoin lacks sufficient infrastructure to really compete on a global level.  IE you can buy bitcoins, but its hard...you can learn how to use a wallet and transfer coins, but its pretty hard for the layperson...you can learn about mining, but algorithms and cryptocurrencies are difficult for the average Joe to grasp (even if once understood they aren't truly complicated).  
Also mature, probably the greatest hurdle bitcoin has atm, is that its simply way too volatile to be taken seriously as a currency.  Its like trying to plan on an important meeting for your career, but how many minutes are in an hour keep changing...yeah, people can take Bitpay or some equivalent, but in reality they are getting Fiat and not really dealing it BTC because Bitpay takes care of all of that.

[this]( comes to mind...be sure to read down.  
1. Speak quickly to the appeal of bitcoin (I mean....maybe?  They really aren't shrewd investors though, just at one point had a ton of money....maybe still, hard to know for sure). 
2. Well known and will attract media attention (more infamous, but yeah, attention)
3. well connected and help demonstrate that serious investors are paying attention and should be....eh...I'm not sure many consider them to be 'serious investors'  I certainly don't, its really not like a billion dollar hedge fund is speaking on behalf of bitcoin here.  
As always, you are free to have your own viewpoint, suffice it to say that there are legitimate reasons why I don't think having them speak is the best move, however.  
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:13:42
As of now, no bitcoin is not responsible in terms of energy...it may get there, but now it just isn't.  To compare it to other possibly irresponsible means of making transactions (I don't have the numbers) doesn't really make bitcoin responsible, just perhaps comparatively better. 
Technology will likely come out that is stronger and uses less energy in time, however. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:00:38
I don't disagree with your description at all.  I'm very pro-bitcoin, but by your own admission they are giant, keep that in mind.  And they are powerful.  And there isn't just one government either, incompetent, sure in some (many) cases, but you could also note that they got away with what they were doing for years.
Just imagine what hasn't been leaked.  
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:49:27
As you've noted, it gets very hazy very quickly.  I'm thinking that as a miner you'd likely be classified as a contractor of the bitcoin network, and thereby compensated as such (with coins).
I'm not at all sure that as such you'd have to register as an MSB, I am under the (very hazy and unclear) impression that exchanges and places like MtGox and Coinlab are MSB's, not miners.
The 'bitcoin community' is now so diverse that there isn't really one way it feels, people are in it for profit and because they are left of center and because they are waiting for the world to end.  I don't know how 'bitcoin' feels anymore than you do.  Do what you want.  Most miners, I'll say, would not be mining if it was not profitable.
Bitcoins are released on a time delay, they won't 'run out' for ~125 years, the amount they are released by will continue to half though.  
ASICs...yeah, they are hard to get because the demand is so high.  You'll either get very lucky or pay a premium for one, and then it won't likely be profitable (people are drastically overpaying for them now).  
The difficulty will go up, unquestionably, with the induction of greater hashing power (ASICS).  What this means is that each hash/second will earn you less money, hence the arms race is on in full effect.  The block reward will be the same, but there will be more people (hashes anyway) splitting the shares in a pool, and it will be almost impossible to find a block on your own.  A pool finds a block via their collective hashrate and then split the work to solve it...a miner is compensated for his/her effort in this process.  More hashes = more blocks found = a more steady stream of income.  Its not very realistic to solo mine at this point....unless your ASICminer or something, and even they don't do it.  The collective hashrate/difficulty is just too high.
And yes, if everybody has an ASIC, you'll need a roomfull to get coins.  Its an arms race, and people do have rooms full of them...mining manufacturers anyway.
@_date: 2013-06-02 22:09:59
Yeah, then they made a mistake.  I think this is because of the mass listings of BFL equipment which doesn't exist and you can't sell something that isn't in your possession on Ebay...Also the amount of chargebacks they have surely had to deal with because of Bitcoin sales and nonsense bids on bitcoin equipment, they likely just lumped it all together.
@_date: 2013-06-01 01:09:07
This equipment was significantly cheaper than the price you quote...the resale value as of this point would be roughly ~$60,000 as of right now (conservatively)...however the owner is mining over $1,000/day so...yeah, a wise investment on his/her part.
A first batch Avalon iirc was $1,300 each (that's the silver one) the batch 2's, the black ones, were priced in BTC (75 I think...or by mining terms at current difficulty, 25 days (sans electricity).

Its not the algorithm that is the concern.  If the NSA or Department of Homeland Security or the DOJ, etc... want to attack Bitcoin they can do it, and they can succeed, easily. They would just have to download the blockchain and mine, then push through double spends or erase spendings, etc...  
The US govt has always been at least a decade ahead in cryptography, and its safe to assume much more than that.  But there isn't any reason for them to 'crack' bitcoin when they have far more than enough hashing power to attack the chain if and when they choose to.
You have to keep things in perspective here.  Many of these gov't entities are VAST and have amazing computational power.

@_date: 2013-05-06 23:36:14
Anytime you experience a realization event, you owe taxes.  Converting BTC to USD at the same rate which you bought them previous, that's not taxable, its just exchanging currencies of equal value.  If, even as a company...say I do business in Mexico and accept Pesos for my work, if I sell on receivable notes (ie net thirty days) and in that time the price of the peso drops, I've experienced a foreign currency transaction loss which goes under other comprehensive gains/losses on my books.
If the value of Bitcoin rises as you hold it, then you are experiencing an unrealized gain in value, which you don't do anything about (though if you are holding a ton of them you'd record in your books the market value of your investment)...if you sell them for fiat then you have experienced a realization event, and you have a capital gains tax to pay on your realized gain.
If you exchange services or goods for Bitcoin you are experiencing a realization event, and the revenue you have just received is taxable (in USD rates....or your equivalent). 
All things are taxable, folks.  
Tl/Dr almost everything you do is a realization event, those are your keywords.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:15:49
But still, even if you love the currency...if you are at 186 (as of now) and feel it will drop to 140, its a wise move to sell at 186 and buy back more BTC (for your same investment) at 140.  
Its not the selling point, not the sole point, but its definitely a point. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:22:22
If the current system wasn't ALREADY in a lot of trouble (and Germany is high on that list...cough...leveraged) then BTC would never have existed.  BTC is the reaction to an unstable economy, never the cause of it. 
Yes, horrible perspective, so you can imagine why people choose BTC.

Paypal comes with fees...BTC doesn't....no reason not to take BTC if it increases profits...in fact it lessens C.C. fees....for a company the size of Amazon that is significant.

The sells go through pretty quickly...and yes, it goes to your account.  And yes, you can put it back in very quickly.  I don't know specific times, but its very fast once its processed in my experience (seconds).  Depends upon their server load at the time I imagine.  
However, there is a processing fee charged by the exchange, so unless there are big price swings, you're not going to make money...in fact you can lose it if it swings the other way, obviously.

This is your mistake in thinking....backing BTC would not necessarily lead to banks failing...for example a BTC bank which paid interest and insured BTC deposits would within a few years become the most powerful banking entity in the world.  Ok, not a few years, but you can see the draw.

No.  MtGox shut down...the price will plummet.  
I don't care because I want BTC to do something, it means something to me...I also don't have millions tied up and can't imagine what some people are going through right now...but its just a number at the end of the day.  Seriously, nobody ever is going to talk about how many BTC they made in '13 on their death bed.  They may, however, talk about what BTC became through hard work and innovation.  
There is a greater battle here that many have lost sight of.  Money is nice, you can have financial freedom...but its just one thing.  Life doesn't start or stop with BTC and no matter where people stand, there is still a bright future ahead here.  
BTC needs a lot of work, but I believe in it.

If they really wanted to they could just d/l the blockchain and fork it.  Or excepting that buy billions worth of asics and fork it.  It wouldn't even take the USA to do it, a smaller country could.  Not saying they would want to, and as big as bitcoin is now, don't underestimate other things.  Or do, it likely doesn't matter at all. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:30:43
They can check the blockchain for transaction records....a forensic accountant will know how to find out.  Essentially you 'are' just transferring money from 'euros' (only bitcoin instead) but any gains need to be accounted for.  
A profit is a profit is a profit, and a tax is a tax is a tax...as they say.

You think MTGox is deliberately sabotaging their personal long term future by looking unreliable?  The short term gain is nothing here.

Well, its quite a reach to think that one can simply be exempt from taxes because he/she invested in something new and finite.  As soon as a gain is realized, its taxable, and that's that.  
Look, I'm on your side, I agree with your sentiment and love the finite aspect of Bitcoin for the same reasons you mentioned, but the risk of not paying taxes is very high.  There are likely entirely legal ways around it at this point, the more money you make the less taxes you pay, after all ;)
But OP needs to seek out that professional advice...not every financial professional is a douche.

Right before he does would be better for you. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 17:10:46
Absolutely you can.  You would need to capitalize and depreciate your equipment..I'd suggest a double-declining balance in this case as the useful life of a mining rig....what with all of the new advancements these days, it seems valid.  
So then you expense that depreciation and end up paying less taxes up front (though more later).
Its also worth noting that its entirely legal to use one set of financial statements and practices to file your taxes and another entirely to actually do your books.  Of course everything has to be GAAP compliant (in the states that is), but you can file one set with the IRS and use another without breaking any law.  Many corporations actually do this.

@_date: 2013-04-18 02:14:22
Well, you are assuming that the 'bullying' of the market you are speaking about will always work in the favor of the disproportionately big party...however, just say that when the huge party sells those coins, instead of the price plummeting down and down and down...perhaps interested buyers pick up and hold onto those coins themselves, and the huge party was the only one to sell.    
It isn't guaranteed that whoever is dumping will actually walk away with more.  If you don't sell, the price fall stops and will rise again.  Whoever is doing the dumping is taking a risk that over time will pay off less and less for them as the BTC base becomes more diversified....finance 101 is that more diversification = less risk...risk in this case as volatility.

2 BTC is not a realistic selling point for Avalon chips, especially with hundreds of thousands set to deliver.  I just repurchased 20 Avalon chips (preorder) from another seller for a total of 2 BTC, and he profited from the deal.
The price of the chips is artificially high if you're seeing them for that amount, I'd be curious where you even saw it that high.
They are on par for price per gh/s at the moment with their boards.  
I'm not supporting Terrahash or saying they are legit, but other than running a pretty small profit margin they appear to be doing things right at the moment, including communicating on bitcointalk.  As to why aren't they gouging?  Well, they aren't even taking preorders at the moment, so they likely feel they have set realistic prices for when the 3 or 4 other competitors who have the same plans they do to jump in the game.  
Tl; Dr if they WERE taking preorders for this low then perhaps cause for concern, but they aren't, and my guess is that ASIC prices drop dramatically when Avalon chips are truly in the wild....there are just SO. DAMN. MANY.

Again, just my concerns.  US gov is not a homogenous body, but it certainly operates like one from the top-down, and it always has.  So to a certain extent...while not homogenous, there likely are very few people making any sort of important decision.  Moreover, its really easy to demonize the US gov and act like it is the source of all the world's problems, but its really bigger than even the US gov, having said that putting that mask on the problems makes them somewhat easier to identify.  
Talk to anyone who has worked in government and they'll tell you about how poorly new ideas are received there.  But again, just my concerns...perhaps unfounded. For that matter, maybe bitcoin doesn't care to be what I wanted it to be...I really don't think it will become that at this point.  
It really seems more about speculation than anything at this point...I totally understand and don't blame anybody for wanting to retire, but its funny how some opinions seemed to shift once their bitcoins were worth a few million in 'worthless fiat'.  Some early adopters were in it for the ethical implications, maybe some were in it for profit and neither thing is bad, but as people push for regulation, well...beautiful vision of the future doesn't really exist.  Not all, of course, but I mean how many does it take?  When bitcoin has become another speculative bubble (even if it never pops its still based on speculation over tangible functionality at this point), what we have is a best case scenario in which bitcoin eventually replaces fiat (it won't happen IMO, not by a longshot) and there is a total redistribution of wealth, but not based on anything other than date of adoption of bitcoin?  That is no more fair than the way things operate now.  Its deflationary, ok, I love that.  Pushing for regulation really mitigates any benefits from that though.  Idk, I just have a bad taste in my mouth about bitcoin lately.  Maybe it'll pass.  Sorry for ranting.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:55:55
The valuation is what people are giving it as of now.  Its not driven by anything other than people honestly.  Sure, the news caught on a bit, but they aren't lauding Bitcoin as a massive tool of utility by any means, quite the contrary, they don't get it and are scared of it.
People are fucking sick of shitty governments wasting and spending and spending more with not a care in the world...and THAT is what people are scared of.  
Even if Bitcoin drops, which it likely will without massive consumer education (on how to use and protect BTC...not unusual for a new product of any kind)...its not going to go anywhere without direct government intervention on a global scale.  And I'm not even sure they can do it.
What you're looking at is the product life cycle of any product...there are innovators (1-2%) of the population who catch on and push something...they are the experts...you'll see this in tech a lot.  Then there are the early adapters (8-10% or so) who catch wind much before the rest of the populace...those that are late and resistant.  
Keep in mind BTC owners are less than a percent of people right now...this thing can get huge, and I mean HUGE.  
Valuations are based upon future expectations, not what something is currently worth.  Many stocks trade at about 30-40 times their Earnings per share (net income divided by outstanding shares)...this isn't done.  If it drops, its coming back up in time.
The numbers are meaningless unless you are selling soon, the utility of BTC and frankly the promise it holds...you can't put a value on that, and don't forget it.

I had misunderstood your explanation.  I thought you meant that the 'change' was broken up into small sums...as opposed to one large sum of change redelivered to the wallet.  I.E. a wallet of 100k sends 5k and receives 95 K back.  Two moves.  
I thought you meant that by sending out a payment once that the change was sent in several lumps back, and was thinking aloud as to why that would be.  
It does seem like this account, on the linked blockchain info...had several 50 BTC transactions, which, to my understanding, does not seem much like how change would work to me.  More like spreading about.  
Thanks for the explanation.

I don't fail to realize that, in fact I am in the community.
However, what you seem to fail to realize is the obvious...the fact that a global level entity such as a government who has had a very vested interest in cryptography since before its private sector inception...in fact that was 20 years ahead in encryption in 1999 when compared to cutting edge private sector technology also probably is innovative and resourceful, in fact likely magnitudes moreso.  That in fact Bitcoin cryptography is called 'military grade' for a reason.
Note: I don't see an attack coming, but the response to OP's thread is simply nothing.  Nothing is in place to stop a government from crushing Bitcoin if they truly want to, which they don't, and likely they won't care to.

And PC gamers with some knowledge (at least) of the space.  Or read: less intimidating for them.

It does, I think that's the point.  We'll see how it works out.

Traditionally, they are very dopey.  Bitcoin was a solid move on their part, ofc.  That's about it. These guys are not good spokespersons for bitcon at all.

He means for starting businesses, filing patents, etc...  I don't think he's advocating a self-defense here, even in litigation.  Don't go to court means: settle out of court.

You need to seek out the services of a qualified professional on this.  What you're talking about doing could very easily lead to significant jail time and fines above what you would pay in taxes.  
It isn't worth it.  I get where you're coming from, of course...any of us who own a business know that we all want to keep our profits (and there are ways), but....well, mate, its not worth it.  
You won, you have a huge win.  Don't turn it into a failure.  
You don't know any experts?  Seek one out.

Now you owe backtaxes.

It depends upon your calculations....obviously those bidding in that range believe so.  By bidding here you are trying to get 10gh/s RIGHT NOW and not a few weeks or months from now.  You're effectively shorting BFL's production and trying to get in before the ASIC batch chips from ASICminer hit, not to mention kncminer's rigs.
Personally, I see some risk in bidding that high...but I can also understand why people are willing to pay those sums for it.  In actuality its on par (give or take) with what Avalon's rigs were going for on Ebay.

Also a diversified mining base...it doesn't suit Avalon to have 50% of the bitcoin mining as they have just undermined themselves, for example.
Moreover, those companies ARE mining as well...that's what the shares you see are, OP.  In other words, they are both mining and selling rigs.
