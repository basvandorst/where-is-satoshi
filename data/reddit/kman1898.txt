Yes I asked gwern about this months ago but his reply was no one has. A crawl of the site from back then. AFAIK most people weren't around in the early days of SR to even know what vendor he might've been. What might've been Ross's vendor handle? I'd think that's pretty incriminating if they have proof.

What about his posts as altoid? His original one on shroomery makes no mention of drugs but 3-4 days later he posted on Bitcointalk and writes something similar but explicitly mentioned 


Implying drug sales.

In the trial...dratel's opening argument was that Ross started the road and subsequently handed it off to DPR due to sress from the site

they may not have brought it up yet though. it's only been 3 days of trial and one witness hasn't even been fully cross examined. bet it gets brought up when ross is on the stand

So now I see why Peter Thiel supports Trump. Peter Thiel sounds like a deep insider to me which is just another reason I know Trump sold us all a bill of goods when he said he would be different and clean up the swamp. What a bamboozle. Peter Thiel seems to have a personality like Trump also. They scratch and claw to get ahead, and screw you if you are not as wealthy as they are. No good is going to come of this Trump administration and certainly these people are not going to be concerned with the little guy. The nation has been had by Fat Satan, and his evil gnomes, otherwise known as Trump and his choices for government. The electoral college needs to change their vote in compliance with the advice of Alexander Hamilton: "The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States." Modern translation, for those who don't speak 18th century-ese: "We certainly don't want a president who has no real qualifications for the job. And while we can see how someone who is good at scandal-mongering and getting publicity might win a single state, we're hoping that person couldn't win multiple states. If they somehow do, then the Electoral College insures against that".
