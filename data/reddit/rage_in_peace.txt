This is an awesome idea. Now I want to make a bunch of instawallets with bitcoins in them, assign each one to a QR code, and make individual stickers to put around my city. Track each one and how long it takes before someone finds it. Maybe with a little charity donation shortlink for a nice suggestion on where to spend on the bottom.

Wow, I wonder how many big coiners have put their coins in that fund or how much of it is Keiser's. Seems like a great way for people with 10,000's in coins to cash out and have their millions be put directly into a Bermuda account (Bitcoin Fund is registered in Bermuda).
I don't know how Funds like this work, but they don't really say how they take their pull. Do they take some of the gains from the value growth of bitcoins? Or old a percentage of each coin?

Getting bank info verified can take up to 2-6 days or something. I would get in line to register at mt.gox right now as well. There is something like 17,000 people waiting to be verified.

No, they have been promising people they will ship their products for the past 6 months without anything while pushing the date back every month. Do not give them your money.

I wouldn't touch them with a ten foot pole. I'm not personally involved with mining, but after reading a lot about them on bitcointalk in the custom hardware mining section I wouldn't go near them. I would recommend doing a lot of research before really going after mining to be sure there is any profit margin with your speed/power consumption and understanding the difficulty increases.

Idea is cool, but it seems there is already a lot of other sites out there that do the same thing. Does your directory provide anything different? If so, maybe try to focus in on that to help break away from the other sites.
Your menu needs organization, it is a little cluttered and spaced unevenly. Also your search by location bar is sitting in an odd location. Try to lock it in with your grid. Something I always like to remember is "The grid will set you free". Each place that is listed looks a little plain, sort of like it was populated by google, maybe mess with that a little. Also, try moving the images with the business logo to the left of the text with the name of the business (like reddit), it's sort of just floating off to the right side right.
Hope that helps. Post your revision when your done, would be happy to look at it.

Bitinstant has always given me great service when I started using them back in January. I can understand it's mega hard to keep up with everything. That is some pretty awesome service right there.

Did you backup your private key to a USB or something? Were you on a bitcoin client or using an ewallet?

Looks like they did set up a [Bitcoin Fund.]( Seems like it would be a great place for him to pump and dump his funds directly into a Bermuda bank account.

Pretty sure the no refunds are after the price change, which was a few weeks ago I think. Some people who ordered in late 2012 have been refunded, but now they are mostly turning all refund requests away regardless of date.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:41:06
They aren't holding or controlling your coins, they are moving them. They are providing a service. People who provide services should be paid.

Wow, after watching clarkmoody (for way too many nights now) it is crazy how good these guys are at causing these mini nose dives. The whole process is pretty fucking amazing, even though they are fucking up the entire exchange. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:42:27
Did you send them bitcoins or paypal? I think after 40 days you can get a refund from paypal. As far as bitcoins they have a new policy of no refunds...

Try the mobile site. When I wasn't able to log on the main site the mobile site worked well to set up triggers incase the price drops.

There is more than one exchange, as someone said it is just the biggest.

A fee is charged for transfers that is given to miners who process your request. You don't have to pay it, but it will not make your transfer a priority.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:51:11
There is an option to not pay it.

You don't have to pay the fee, but your transaction could take a very long time. With that amount of bitcoins it is understandable to not pay the fee. 
I always feel that if someone provides a service, they should be paid for what they do. As a designer/painter I often have people ask me to provide them a free service because it is something I enjoy doing. Of course I do work for free sometimes, because I do enjoy it, but as with miners I need to pay bills.
I understand how you didn't know, maybe this will help.

They were hacked last week and had all the funds pulled out of their cold storage. Everyone was watching that adress because the transaction was so huge. They eventually put up a message on one of their affiliate sites saying the address was theirs... but now it doesn't look so good.
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:10:23
So the more careful I am with the things I care about, the more likely they are to be stolen? If I am smelling what your stepping in correctly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:03:30
That can take a couple days, they are pretty quick about it though. Just be sure you know they use the price of bitcoins when your transaction goes through, usually 5 days or something like that.
You can try using 
They cost more than current value, but the way things have been going it would be the quickest route. Not sure how much bitcoins will be worth in a couple days, but if it keeps growing at this rate it could be a lot higher than it is right now.

Did you do any research on their current status with their orders? They haven't shipped their ASIC for over 6 months since they said they were. You are most likely in a late batch too, so I wouldn't expect a rig until at least late July.
