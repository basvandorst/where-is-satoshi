No such thing as a reliable source in trading, kind of an oxymoron. It's like trying to have protected sex with 1,000,000 pin holes in it.
But bitcoin is like a condom formulated to give extra protection even when 1,000,000 pin holes have been stabbed through, but ribbed and flavoured at the same time

For traders, it will break 5000 and then drop a good third, and then rise.  If it's long term, HODL. If trading, you would be silly to buy now. 
I would be surprised if it continues to go above 5000 without and noticeable crash.

We expected a pull back, and it happened. But did anyone predict or expect this current spike ?

Is anyone in the financial world reliable? I'm not being rude, but realistically, the quantitative data of BTC tells US the story and gives us the answers to all opinions and assumptions.

So he's not a reliable source then.......

It survived good resistance, won’t under 6 briefly, stable at 5.8. Strap in yo! Look for those dojis and candle
