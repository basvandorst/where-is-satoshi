good question. it is actually not a cap but the difficulty of finding valid block hashes gets ajusted automatically to get to an average of about 1block per 10 min. why? these are design choices. if we would just change it to 1 min a block the blockchain will be 1tb+ next year!

question is, how many ppl understand it even though they read it? you have to be atleast on a bachelor CS level to grasp the fundamental concepts.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:09:03
and the contrary is? get some understanding in how the mining difficulty gets adjusted and get an economics course for morons.

it might still get confirmed, otherwise send the transaction again with double or tripple the fees after 72 hours from initial broadcast. your coins are safe.

'De virtuele munt kan bij een aankoop direct tussen twee computers worden uitgewisseld, zonder transactiekosten en tussenpersonen.' 
It says bitcoin can be traded without fee's. New patch? nice! lol.

your source is another reddit post that has no source...

Right now transactions &gt; 0.1btc with 0 fees are not even propagated by the bitcoin network, many nodes will reject them regardless transaction  size.
Moreover, default in core is to remove unconfirmed transaction after 72 hours. The chance that within this time a miner picks up your 0 fee transaction and find the solution to the block is not happening. They have no intensive to do so.

5%? I guess u mean 50%?
Bitcoin right now has a maximum of handling about 288.000 transaction each 24 hours. Whatever fits in there is bitcoins limit.
