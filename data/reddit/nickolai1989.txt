Segwit adoption above 10%, but still low, doesn't seem like there's been a significant change.

It's most likely exactly what you said, wallets will either a hardcored fee or a simplified estimator. I can think of one simple way to estimate that I might implement if I went in a time crunch and had other things to do: look at the highest fee transaction in the previous block and use that. It could also be that whoever wrote that code is no longer around, so their compatriots now have to spend the extra effort to find the code, understand it, and change it, while getting all their other shit done.

Not following you. If Alice and Bob have a channel in which each has 2.5 BTC, and Bob and Eve have a channel in with each have 0.1 BTC, then if Alice wants to send 0.1 BTC to Eve, she does it through Bob, and then the remaining balance would be, I believe:
Right? So then Alice could keep sending 0.1 BTC 9 more times if she'd wanted to send a full BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:34:16
To open a channel, you and the counter-party (in this case the merchant) both send some amount of BTC to a special multi-sig address (if you need an explanation of that please feel free to ask) in an on-chain transaction. Say you send 5 BTC to that address and the merchant sends 0 BTC. Then you can make lots of transactions that rearrange that amount without having to go on-chain. i.e. you buy some groceries and the new balance is {you:4BTC, merchant:1BTC}. Then you get back to your car and realize you bought the wrong thing, and get a refund, and now the balance is {you:4.5BTC, merchant:0.5BTC}
If you don't have a connection with the merchant, but you've previously opened one with Alice, and separately Alice has opened one with Bob, and separately Bob has opened one with the merchant, then you can use that channel to pay the merchant.
When you decide you won't be doing future business with the merchant (or for some other practical reason), you broadcast the latest balance between the two of you to the blockchain, get it confirmed on-chain, and now the channel is closed.
Hopefully that makes sense. IMHO, LN is pretty neat, but not all that great since it requires you to lock your BTC in a channel until you decide to close it, and this can be a tough proposition with all the volatility. Also, the multi-hop payment we discussed (You-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;Merchant) only works if A and B have enough BTC in their channels. If you want to send 1 BTC, but the A&lt;-&gt;B channel only has 0.1 BTC, you can't (although I wonder if it could be accomplished by sending 0.1 BTC 10 times, sorry, thinking out loud :) ).

Roger Ver on layer two scaling: 
Jihan Wu: 
Please don't take those two tweets as complete refutation of what you say, please continue to look into what these guys are saying and come to your own conclusions.
You're absolutely right to ask who will develop these solutions. The market for crypto developers is crazy small right now, and so success or failure of a coin or a technology is tied to the developers in a very unbalanced way. That's why I'm trying to learn as much about them individually as I can, to try to figure out where this is all going to go.
I believe there are ways to scale off-chain without segwit. Thomas Zander has a proposed fix for transaction malleability called Flexible Transactions. I haven't looked into it much, so I don't know how much sense it makes, but putting it out there. Also, transaction malleability doesn't technically need to be fixed for something like Lightning Network, but it makes it much more efficient, since there's no need to reverse-lookup a transaction ID (I think). I doubt that LN is the limit of innovation here, so I'm hopeful there will be other super-creative solutions to these problems.
Edit: Just want to add that I tried to find a less aggressive quote from Ver about layer 2, but it was really tough. The guy puts his foot in his mouth more often than he should, and it seems like he could do with a better technical understanding of the issues involved, but the point remains that he is not against off-chain scaling. He's been consistent about solving the issues that are facing users today, and that a block size increase is the quickest and most effective way to do that today.

There are a couple issues with the sections on architecture and unbounded demand for cheap block space.
On architecture, the time it takes to notify all the nodes of a desire to spend bitcoin should be less than a second, given that ping time between Stockholm and Tokyo is ~300ms. [1] For Paypal I imagine it would be similar, and for various purposes (auditing, tracking money laundering, data mining...) I imagine Paypal would want to store the data for quite a long time. Actually Paypal has a disadvantage here because they need to pay for the database and all the backups themselves, whereas node ownership is distributed.
On unbounded demand for cheap block space, it's claimed there's "a real cost associated with processing and storing these transactions". I say this is virtually false. An average bitcoin transaction is about 500 bytes [2]. A 1TB SSD from Amazon is &lt;$500 (and that's for the high performance one). So the cost of 1 GB is $0.5, so for 1MB it's $0.0005, so for 1 KB it's $0.0000005, so for one transaction it's $0.00000025. But what about electricity costs to run the node? Well, let's say you run a 1000 W mining node. Global average electricity prices are ~$0.20/kWh, so daily electricity cost would be 24h/day*1KW*$0.2/KWh = $4.8/day, but that's $4.8 in electricity cost to store billions of transactions and process hundreds of thousands, so divide it up accordingly.
The point of the detailed explanation is to show that block space is really really cheap! BCH is not making it artificially low, it is really really low! If anything, BTC is making it artificially high by saying that only 144 MB may be used per day (1 MB block every 10 minutes). That's silly!
[1] 
[2]  (Take average block size, multiply it by 144 blocks per day (1 every 10 minutes), convert to bytes, divide by number of transaction)

You've picked a very controversial topic, although it really shouldn't be controversial. I'm sorry you're getting such condescending responses.
The discussion around this issue was so intense that some people who disagreed with bitcoin's strategy for handling large numbers of transactions (segwit, layer 2 solutions) created the offshoot bitcoin cash which aims to solve the issues you mentioned by increasing the block size. That group believe their solution will be more effective than segwit+layer 2.
Hopefully that puts things in context and maybe gives you some fodder for more research.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:42:36
To your first point, you've made a faulty leap somewhere. You seem to have taken 100 million and multiplied it by the cost of the 1TB hard drive, not sure why or to what effect.
Absolutely agree that continued on-chain scaling will test the limits of our hardware and that for bitcoin to remain scalable off-chain scaling is necessary. I'm as curious to see BCH's plans for off-chain scaling as the next guy, but it's important to point out that BCH is not principally opposed to off-chain scaling [1]
[1]  Relevant quote: "Bitcoin Cash will probably not see SegWit in its current shape, not as a soft fork. But fixing malleability and enabling Layer 2 solutions will happen."

Actually, something else is bothering me now. The part about updating the latest network transaction. As described in the article:




What's to stop Bob from receiving Alice's secret, stiffing her on his secret, and then broadcasting the previous transaction?
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:59:31
This isn't how market forces work.
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:35:22
Hm, I guess all I'm pointing out is that at any point in the process of updating the previous transaction, which takes 4 steps total (Alice hands a new commit transaction to Bob, Bob hands a new commit transaction to Alice, Alice gives Bob her secret for the old transaction, Bob gives Alice his secret), Bob could get mad that he's getting one less bitcoin than before and go ahead and publish the old commit transaction, right up until he hands Alice the secret, then he can't anymore (practically speaking). I suppose it's not really a flaw though, since he can do that at any point in time, even before a new agreement on balance is reached.
Thanks for indulging me.

Figures presented with explanations are far more valuable than those presented without explanations.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:57:06
Well, there's no risk of fund stealing (at least as far as I can tell), but if you have the new signed commitments, but haven't exchanged the previous secrets, then there's still very real risk of the other party broadcasting your old commitments, and you wouldn't be able to do anything to stop them (unless you immediately publish the new commitment, and then it's a race to see which one gets confirmed first). But then again, that's simply the nature of the beast - either party can broadcast their signed commitment at any time, right up until secrets are exchanged and then it no longer makes sense to publish.
Edit: Just wanted to add thanks to you, for the conversation, it's been quite helpful
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:22:16
Thanks for that link, I think I get it now, this is the part that I was missing:


Obviously that transaction gets broadcast, so now Alice's bitcoins are locked into the channel until either her or Bob publish their "commit transaction".
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:11:02
I'm still missing something.


Doesn't Bob have to give that secret to her for that? I'm proposing that he renegs and doesn't provide the secret, then she can't block the transaction. Also, for the first option, it's my understanding that Alice has already signed the previous transaction, because one of the mechanisms for lightning network to provide trustless transactions is that either party can broadcast a transaction immediately, so he wouldn't need Alice's signature at the point that he receives Alice's secret and renegs on providing his secret.
So, there must be some part of the transaction I'm not fully understanding...
