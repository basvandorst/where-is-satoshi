He still believed in the pure bitcoin ideology back then and hadn't been compromised yet. And now we all know who compromised Hearn.

Those words will come back to haunt her, I guarantee it. I'm not saying it's vaporware or anything stupid like that. Just that the time required for such complex systems is usually underestimated. It takes time to get everything working as it should which is why I always multiply my time estimates by two just to be on the safe side.

My interpretation has always been that the rights outlined in the founding documents do not pertain to any citizenship in particular. They are inclusive of all people. They're saying that governments don't grant rights. They already exist before government, and that government cannot (should not) violate them.

Why should Core compromise Bitcoin to appease terrorists? 
@_date: 2014-10-11 22:35:44


That's not what the Bill of Rights says at all. The Constitution makes absolutely no distinction between citizens and non-citizens. Those rights apply to all people, American or not, because a person is born with those rights. They are not issued by any government.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:51:40
It's weird that some people beg their government to keep them safe, and shun those who exercise their right to protect themselves, even when the government is failing at the task or actually putting lives in danger. Taking responsibility for your own safety is one of the highest points of liberty possible, but I understand how that concept may seem foreign to those who never had it to begin with.

Wow, you never struck me as an anti-rights person before. I would have thought that as a bitcoin proponent, you would have understood individual sovereignty. Your ignorance is in full display here. It's really sad to realize that you're just another one of the brainwashed masses. I pray that you and your loved ones never need to defend themselves, only to be left helpless by your own naïvety.

It's also unelected government officials who have no term limits and are very difficult to get rid of. They are able to steer corporate media and influence public opinion and are not accountable to the general public.

There's no way in hell that I'm ever going to rely on a fucking smart watch in a potential life or death situation. Guns are designed to be mechanically simple for a reason: they need to be 100% reliable when you need them most. As soon as you introduce a single line of code, that reliability drops dramatically.

This is sarcasm right? He said he might, but doesn't want to. And it wasn't a 'small blockist' who has been working on centralized blockchains for banking cartels for several months now. It was the previous lead developer who dropped the project.

Snowden never intended to get stuck in Russia. If the United States had not revoked his passport, he would probably be in South America. He can't travel to the US without risking being murdered or indefinitely detained for exposing unconstitutional and illegal mass surveillance against hundreds of millions of innocent people. It's very telling that he's safer in Russia than he is in the United States.

Gavin's reputation would not be so shattered if he had done the least bit of due diligence.

The traitors are those in power who conduct mass surveillance against American citizens because they consider us their enemies. We are the nation, and they have betrayed us.

We should be aware of the positions that influential people hold regarding basic civil rights. If they have no appreciation for the rights of ordinary people, then I won't hesitate to disregard just about anything else they say. To me, Andreessen is the traitor here for enabling and defending even worse traitors.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:06:54
If he had leaked them to journalists like Snowden did, then I would assume he did so because he realized the extent of injustice that has been taking place. That would make him a whistleblower.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:55:12
Snowden is a whistleblower and a political refugee who evidence documenting both constitutional and human rights violations by the United States Government. The traitors are still in positions of power. Not a single traitor has been punished. Only the other whistleblowers who have been put into prison for attempting to inform the American public of how their rogue government classified billions of civilians as enemies.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:07:36
Because he didn't work for the Putin regime's intelligence agencies. What kind of question is that?
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:55:27
He also had the audacity to call Edward Snowden a ["textbook traitor"]( He openly defends mass surveillance which violates the human rights of billions of people and is costing American tech companies tens of billions of dollars.
