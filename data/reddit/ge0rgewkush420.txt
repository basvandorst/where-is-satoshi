I remember when we used to celebrate every $100, then $500, now we can’t even keep up and celebrate every $1000. People are starting to realise it’s not too late to buy bitcoin, just because I wasn’t alive in the gold rush doesn’t mean I can’t invest in gold, I can I’d just rather put that money into bitcoin ;)

I got my first .1 at $5000 before that I had .006 from $500 and now I’m at .14 so pretty new to bitcoin considering when I got my first .006 bitcoin wasn’t seen as much of an investment as it is now. And after I had .1 my gambling or in this case sensible side got that up to .14, not much for a lot of people but it’s a lot for me working in a supermarket with managers that treat me like garbage.
