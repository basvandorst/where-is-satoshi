Just run Avira. It found nothing. Clean as a whistle. :(

Sorry to hear about your loss. I don't know if there is some sort of malware or something out there, but this is still an unsolved situation. I've checked my system days after the event occurred for me and I am still clear of anything malicious in my computer. :-s
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:39:40
Might I also add that with regards to how all of this went down in my situation, I had just recently transferred those funds from a computer that didn't have the option for encryption to the new one which did. Since I've been out of the scene for a while, I thought, well if nothing has been stolen from my wallet over in the other machine which hasn't got any encryption in it, why do I need bother doing it in the new machine? This is basic (ignorant) conclusion that many of us would potentially arrive at.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:06:58
Well I just followed the BlockChain.info site information. I posted the address that took the money out of my wallet, that is to say the address to whom the thief transferred the money from my wallet, and  you can see not only his address but my address also where the transaction took place.

Windows 8.1 operating system. I have scanned my machine and found nothing in there. You can read all the details of what I've done thus far in the other thread. Thank you for passing the word on Tach. If I could tip you I would.

I didn't notice there being any lag and it just seemed that she had troubles speaking. xD
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:17:51
I have scanned my system Joele and I have found nothing. I've run Trend Micro's Housecall antivirus, Malwarebytes &amp; Spybot to find nothing in my system. I will run Avira to check again just incase. None the less thank you so much for your support. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:05:30
I've had my wallet since 2011. On another computer which I've not used or even connected online. I recently moved that information to my new machine which I scanned for viruses and malware etc. I used Trend Micro antivirus, Spybot, Malwarebytes to clean my machine and check that there was nothing installed that would cause alarm. It all came back clear.

If I ever plan getting into this whole thing I will for certain look into using a different form of dealing with this digital money. There is too much at stake. I wonder if ever something could be added similar to say getting a message via phone requesting client authentication before payment can be sent from your account. If no response is received, then the payment will not go through. This could be the last fall safe for wallets and thus helping make them that little bit safer.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:31:18
Thank you Jokob. Quick question, I am reading the "Two Factor Authentication" and not quite understanding what you mean by it. I don't use an exchange (that I know of) to transfer money. I did it all through my wallet. Or am I misinterpreting what you are saying? Ignorance seems to have been my biggest flaw in all of this.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:28:27
Thank you for informing us on this. I just left the individual a message. The more people that are aware just of how easily their funds can be taken the better. For at the moment anyone getting into this that is not "Tech Savvy" may find it rather complicated to keep their money safe. Its a reality that I see being used to steal money from many. What a shame.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:29:44
One thing I failed to mention is that a few days ago I did a transfer of bitcoin from a mining pool I was a member of. 2 days after that I found an email asking me to verify if I wanted to change the address where I would receive my money. This I quickly ignored went to the website changed passwords and locked my address. The mining pool I used back then was  a message in their forums on the 3rd of this month aludes to the problem I had. 
Not sure if this has any bearing on the situation, but also know that pools are being targeted for those that used to mine and possibly didn't go back etc. Many people gave up back in 2011 after the market took that huge crash.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:31:52
Done. :)
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:18:47
Thank you so much for all this information Yohodel. For me at this stage I think I will just gracefully pull out *no pun intended* and watch everyone else enjoy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:54:06
When you have nothing to start with and then boom you have something (because its value has increased) then yes, that by default becomes my life savings. For in other words I meant that I had nothing, then a little something which I could consider my life savings (which was going to be the plan. To not spend a penny of what was left on that wallet). Sorry if that was not clear.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:03:55
Its a shame really that people downvote when really the whole purpose of this post is to keep everyone informed so as many people as possible avoid the problems I faced today.

@_date: 2013-12-05 20:24:08
Thank you so much for the explanation. I was not aware of the above system. I guess to what I was suggesting in another response that bitcoin should have. If there was a way to allow it so that say your wallet actually had something like that it would be excellent. I don't know that I like the idea of my money being available in an exchange website. But then again, my money being made available in a wallet how I had it was really even worse. Oh boy, I wish there was Wallet+Phone Authenticator process. This really would help the masses.
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:51:14
Thank you for your response. I was going to ask you, what is one to do? Those of us that would like to get into this whole digital currency thing? Avoid windows and install linux? Also, if you can't do that (say you are not well versed in that technology) what can be done to avoid this issues? It just makes no sense that even after doing those checks and finding NOTHING, my money was taken. I am just shocked to be honest. Then again, sounds like I am also terribly gullible to this whole process.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:41:11
I just showed the lovely people at (in their live chat) the system logs and they have verified that my system is totally clear. :-s 
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:10:01
Thank you so much for your support. I don't know that I will be able to actually recover from this loss. I can't really afford buying bitcoins and there is no way I could afford getting into mining. I did the little mining I did back when one could actually get something out of it with a graphics card. I can't get back into Bitcoins sadly. It was nice whilst it lasted though. Thanks again. &lt;3
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:44:44
Sorry to hear about your loss Ciano. I know exactly how you feel. :(
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:17:42
I didn't actually tag that stuff but someone did it. I would love how to do that too if anyone can give us a heads up. Good question GeekyGirl.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:26:16
Another Girl. And yes my money was stolen :(
Sorry to hear about your loss Khabob42. Seems like that particular address is making the rounds and stealing all it can. If with our post we can just bring some awareness for our fellow reddit readers then at least our loss was not in vain if we can save them the trouble we have endured.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:08:36
Sorry yes 1.68 is what was stolen. My head is in another planet right now. I am so upset. Sorry :(

I just bought two Asus 27" monitors from The Bitcoin Store. They arrived safely in the United Kingdom all the way from sunny California. A total of 7 days including customs and even included stickers that said Sold with Bitcoin. Too cool of a company, great customer service. Made my year. +1 for them.

This is rather concerning if true :-s
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:21:59
Thank you so much for your support Avsa. The bitcoin wallet was moved from the old computer I originally used to mine them to this new machine just over a week or so ago. It is really obvious after reading some of the details that have been given in this thread that in order to keep save your money, you really have to jump through hoops. There seems to be far more to the safety of your money than meets the eye. A BitcoinQT wallet that is encrypted may not (will not) do the trick. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:44:46
I will certainly look into the Linux stuff. It is well overdue and I really need to catch up a bit more with regards to security situations. It is no longer safe to just use your run of the mill antiviruses, malware scanners. When dealing with all of these things where money is being utilized it is imperative to be more on the ball with how to best keep your data safe.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:57:28
Thank you very much Mafi0s0. Sophos didn't find anything. But I will endevour to be more careful in future. I didn't have my wallet encrypted (I though I had stated that, sorry if I missed that out) so I am sure this helped a lot. Someone mentioned that since recently loads of people whom collected coins back then didn't do anything with their coins, they are all coming out of the woodwork and those wallets maybe will get stolen. My original bitcoin program didn't have an encryption option. BitcoinQT has it but I only got it this week and didn't really think I would need it since I had not used it with the other Bitcoin program from before. Remember kids...don't do what I did and you should be fine!
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:13:59
The sad thing about all this is that if the system demands so much from the user to keep their funds safe, this will make it a very difficult thing for many to get into. Which in turn makes the whole digital currency thing a very unsafe method for currency since most people (average at a best guess) are not well informed as to how involved one needs to get with the whole "cold storage" thing. Even now after all this has happened to me, I am finding out information about how I should have stored the coins better. Shame I was not well versed on the matter before. But maybe these posts can act as a warning to fellow readers so they too can avoid my misfortune.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:36:04
Funny enough the only reason why I did put the bitcoins into the machine that got wrecked was for spending it. I guess it is a matter of put in wallet, spend straight away and then let an air out of joy that in that time nothing was taken.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:17:26
Thank you for your support &amp; encouragement. I guess right now is all I can hope for. Thank you all so much for being so wonderful. It is lovely to see that a community of people can be so kind when things like this happen.
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:25:29
How would one go about whitelisting applications? Do you have any suggestions? Thank you so much for informing us on all of this NinjaJewish.

The top two transactions here
1BjxoP5BDwxPG4myiXhJK8zWownJUbd4K4 &lt;-- This is the address that stole my money.
The other transactions are payments I made by buying some stuff. The money that was stolen was just going to be saved for a while for future eventualities since it was all I had.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:42:53
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:23:53
Thank you so much Voiceinthevoid. You are quite right. There needs to be a much user friendly way to keep these funds safe. For many people just 1 coin would make a huge difference. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:51:24
I have one question, is there no way to put a stop to this address that is still until now stealing money? Is the system made in such a way that there is no way in which to make that address a rogue one that no payments are sent to? It is just crazy to me that I made this post nearly  11 hours ago and the little "Sun of a Beach" is still at it. Another person just had their bitcoins stolen just now  
If only there was a list of all these awful address that one could at least add them to their wallets so no payments are ever sent to them. Granted that this would not 100% deter these things happening, but at least it would help a little.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:15:40
Yes we both lost Bitcoin if you followed the original post where you'll find links to our stories. Read up and be safe. Don't make our mistakes. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:59:50
Good call Avsa. We need to keep everyone informed and always aware of these situations. Be they user fault or hacker intrusion. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:20:55
Thank you for clarifying this to me. I am rather ignorant on the matter as you can tell from my silly suggestion. I guess when frustration arises one just tries to throw shit on the wall to see what sticks. Thanks again.

If there is indeed some sneaky way in which data is being access and leaving no trace, this maybe a bigger problem that will become even more rampant due to the increase in value of Bitcoin. Currently scanning with Sophos just incase. Thank you so much MaFi0s0. I'll keep you posted since this is going to take a bit of time to run through the scan.
