Fuck you.  How can I buy on this site , when there is exactly one sell order which is demanding 17% on top of current bitcoin exchange rate ?
Do you get the numbers 17% margin ?

Ughh! 
Why do  we try to come up with cheapest web-site, which lacks the most basic features ?
No logins ?  So if I clean up my cookie my order history is gone ? 
This site doesn't look like where I would want to sell my bitcoins. (and trust me I do want to sell many BTC in India to INR..)
I just saw the sight, and it told two people are visiting the site.

I have already paid large sum to BlackArrow, but when I was trying to find their progress I came across this post, where Mr. Alex Berke claims some claims about BlackArrow.
Neither in the article it is mentioned who is he and how is he related to BlackArrow, nor I could find this information anywhere on the internet.
 
On top of that ALL the articles related to Alex berk, quote the same text, so  I am assuming he was part of some PR relationship announcement.  
 
At this point point I am like that deer in front of the car, with eyes wide open and half of the body under the car.

Fixed it.  And I was thinking of a system less of a scheme. :)

Just make my stand clear.
Thank you very much BitQuick.in  for opening this website.
I am  hoping that there would be more people here doing the trade without exorbitant 17% margin (not bitquick margin but the seller's margin I am saying.)
The other point is the site design IMHO doesn't give confidence of an organization which has invested heavily. I personally (not sure about others) would not trust any of my bank account info on a site that doesn't even  supply verisign information to verify the site domain.
