The cryptosea, she be a harsh mistress.

Exactly my case. I've profited 2x my investment, when I could have profited over 6x if I had hodled. Actually, I managed to profit over 9x after a few well placed positions, but I'm extremely prone to FOMO and placed a buy order just after an ATH of a pump, which proceeded to dump hard and never get back up. Hodled for two weeks before realizing I had lost over 65% of my BTC and decided to sell and look for new profit opportunities, which is where I am right now.
Word of advice? Think well and hard before panic buying something that has shot up for the moon just because you think this is your golden opportunity. This is FOMO in it's worst form and will statistically cause you to lose a lot of money. Every now and then you might get lucky like I did that one time, but if you keep FOMOing eventually you'll get burned.

Right now: there are two competing Bitcoin blockchains


Later:  there are three competing Bitcoin blockchains
Rinse and repeat.

No more FUD, only moon now.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:33:56
Hahahahaha yeah, I guess so. I still fucked up a few more times after that, but Bitcoin has been mooning so hard that it's become hard to actually lose money, though I could've earned a lot more if had just hodl.

Not gonna lie, this is me at any given day these past few weeks, except I only act upon my impulses about half the time. Lost quite a few btc. 10/10, would panic sell again.
^^^^Pls ^^^^help

I wonder if places like this, that accept bitcoin as payment, usually hodl them or rather exchange by the end of the day. I mean, if only a small fraction of costumers pay with bitcoins, it's not much of a problem to hodl, but as this fraction increases, they'll end up needing to exchange to cover the costs of the business (of course, assuming these costs can't be covered with crypto, as I'm sure is the case). This would put pressure in exchanging as soon as possible to prevent losing money due to fluctuations in price, which would make then increase the transaction fee to ensure a speedy confirmation, that [as of now] would put it at the hundreds of satoshi per byte, which would increase the price of the coffee to a point where it's not cost effective to pay with crypto, compared to fiat.

This guy gets it.

Yeah, I'm sure a lot feel this way, but even now, with the very real prospect of devaluing due to the upcoming updates, hodlers still refuse to sell high and buy low, as if their religion doesn't permit them.
A week ago one bitcoin was worth 2600 usd, now it's hovering around 2000 usd and probably still to fall a lot more. Wouldn't this be a great time to trade?
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:40:58
That, and trying to capitalize on further FUD sales. I'd like to say I learned my lesson, but I know I'll try something like that again in a few weeks. Too much anxiety.

Makes sense for Venezuela, but what about other countries? Also, what's to prevent me from spending a shit ton of money there, pay in btc with a low tx fee and double spend a while later?
I've never actually tried to double spend to see if it works (even if just between my wallets), but that seems to be a real possibility, right? I've just recently started using bitcoin, but these high tx fees (to ensure a quick confirmation time) seem to me like the weakest point about the system.

Well, yeah, but a good design should take that into consideration in order to avoid centralization. That is, if you consider decentralization to be inherently a good idea (some don't, I won't judge).
@_date: 2017-07-21 23:10:09
Fuck, this hits too close to home. Started out fine, made a few satoshi selling high and buying low, then proceeded to mess it all up and bought high and sold low at every chance I got. 
Long story short, bought in at $2750, will recover my original investment at $3100. 10/10, would recommend.
@_date: 2017-07-11 00:40:10
And here I am, selling at the bottom to get some of that sweet below $2000 bitcoin later on and make me some extra change, only to realize that as soon as my order got accepted the price shot up $100 in half an hour. How do I stop being retarded, guys?
@_date: 2017-07-11 09:46:56
Welp, fuck me. I listened to strangers online and bought back in at a higher price than I sold, and it dropped soon after. Serves me right, I guess.
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:48:30
Let's assume a fork does happen, and I have the private keys to all my coins. Theoretically, that means I have the same amount of coins in both chains, effectively owning twice the amount of coins I previously had (regardless of their fiat worth post-fork), correct?
But, as soon as I transfer my coins [from Electrum, for example] to a wallet on any of these two chains, I'll once again own the original amount of coins, right? Wouldn't there be a way to transfer these coins to both chains?
Excuse my ignorance, I've read a lot about cryptocurrencies, but I'm still not entirely familiar with how they work.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:54:00


Truer words have never been spoken. I'll just buy back in and hodl on.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:00:05
I have, it really helped me understand the idea behind blockchain. Ok, using the analogy used in the video, Bob transferred me 1 btc, and this transaction was recorded on a block and added to the chain. After the fork, there are two chains, but both continue using the original blocks, adding their respective new blocks to their separate chains. That means that in both chains there's a transaction stating that Bob sent me 1 btc.
This 1 btc is associated with a wallet on Electrum, which I own the seeds. If I send my 1 btc to another wallet I own and this transaction is added to a bitcoinA chain, I continue to have 1 btc on that chain, and cease to have 1 btc in the Electrum wallet. But according to bitcoinB chain, that same 1 btc continues to be associated with that Electrum wallet, and was never transfered. How would I got about keeping my 1 btc on the bitcoinB chain? Actually, how can I even decide which chain my transaction gets added to?
I hope this makes any sense.

God damnit you guys, this is making sense and I have my finger on the sell button. All aboard the regret train!

FFS, bought some bitcoins yesterday for the first time at $2750 and now it's at $2600 and dropping. Maybe this is not a game for anxious people. [My reaction right now.](
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:34:12
God damn it guys, I was weak and sold to cut my losses, and now it's up. Maybe hodling is the best strategy after all.
