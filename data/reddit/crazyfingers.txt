I didn't downvote but I think a lot of bitcoiners are wary of the idea of promoting bitcoin the protocol as if it is a product or service for sale. 
Now if it was blockchain.info (&gt;$300k in monthly revenue) or Coinbase as the sponsor that would make more sense. (Although it would be very unlikely in this particular case at this point in time).
I would try and find a local corporate sponsor -- talk to a manager. Maybe a giant retailer like best buy which probably has a community outreach/charitable division that could write a $1100 check at the drop of a hat. JMO.

As far as purchasing Bitcoin, Coinbase is a popular option for U.S. residents. You connect your checking account and do an ACH transfer. It is also an online wallet service. Another popular wallet service is blockchain.info, but they don't sell coins. Check out localbitcoins.com for another purchasing option.
Normally you can not buy bitcoin with credit cards or paypal because of the high risk of chargebacks.
A paper wallet is a simple way to safely store coin offline. Basically you create a public address and a private key and print it out. You send your coin to the public address. The private key can then be used to import the coin later.

IMO Bitcoin is not a product to try and sell. It is something people will have to come to naturally because it benefits them somehow. There were never ads for "The Internet" back in the 90s. However, there were ads for America Online. The same thing is happening in the Bitcoin space. I was at a libertarian conference sponsored by blockchain.info earlier this year. Another example of bitcoin being promoted organically is Overstock adding the We Accept Bitcoin logo to the end of their nationally-run commercials. That kind of subtle approach will be most effective and will happen anyway.

Unfortunately one can't really buy bitcoin with credit card/paypal because those are reversible (risk of chargebacks) and bitcoin isn't.

Of course it can. America became the wealthiest nation in the history of the world on a framework very amendable toward libertarianism, the U.S. Constitution.

However we can get back closer to that ideal by electing Sen. Rand Paul, current Republican frontrunner, president in 2016.

In the U.S. it would take electing an entire new slate of anarcho-capitalist leaning politicians who would then eliminate the central bank. Not going to happen.
I was thinking about this earlier though. There is this group called The Seasteading Institute. The idea is to establish an autonomous country in international waters, either on a raised platform or some type of modified cruiseship. This will happen eventually, and BTC will probably be the predominant currency in the new country's economy.

I don't think it is anything nefarious. If they called it the "Bitpay bowl" no one would know what it was. People would just assume they are a payroll company or something. But calling it the "Bitcoin Bowl", people go, "Oh yeah, I've heard of that..."

Businesses that choose to accept it now can have it immediately converted to fiat using a payment processor like Coinbase or Bitpay. So for those businesses there is little reason to not accept it, since they get the benefit of lower fees (1% versus ~3% for credit cards) and all else is equal. This is what Overstock and I assume Tiger Direct does. 
Worth noting however that the Overstock CEO has already talked about potentially paying willing suppliers and offering employee bonuses in bitcoin.

If you want to purchase some from Coinbase you need to connect a checking account. This can be done instantly if you give them your online bank credentials or otherwise it takes a few days. The actual order takes a while to process too because they do an ACH transfer. It takes time but probably the easiest and lowest fee way for US residents to obtain bitcoin.
You don't have to buy (I wouldn't say "invest") a significant amount, of course you could, but you could also buy $10 worth. There are "elance" type sites where you can earn bitcoin but you pretty much need to have some some sort of skill like programming. If you have something to sell for BTC you could try listing it on auction site cryptothrift.

All of the points you mentioned of course plus the Gox-effect slowly fading, with more professional exchanges slowly coming into place (Circle or whoever). Really technically the rise is due to Bitcoin USD price being a longerm bubble situation; it is going to keep rising and falling until it finds a price equilibrium which will take years. (I'm not a stock trader but this seems obvious.)
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:13:59
I'm not an early adopter but the disparity doesn't bother me. In my view BTC is about what the protocol makes possible. $20 in BTC bought today can be exchanged for around $20 worth of goods and/or services, regardless of who owns the majority of BTC. The people who had foresight and took early risks, who essentially made it all happen, deserve to be rewarded. 
IMO BTC was never about and can never be about equality. It's about freedom.

Does it sound horrible to think the government might have been involved in something like that, as a pretense for "gun control"? Well there's this scandal called Fast and Furious that is an establishment admitted fact. It involves the Justice Department intentionally exporting thousands of high-powered weapons to Mexican drug cartels. This has resulted in an untold number of deaths. Those deaths at the hands of U.S. made guns were going to be used to undermine the Second Amendment, until they were caught red-handed.

You already answered your initial question. It is an attempt to build up the network. BTC already has a huge advantage here and IMO will ultimately be the only surviving free-market currency. 
As for your second question, Western Union and Moneygram probably see Bitcoin as a small niche not worth their time. They are blockbuster in the mid-1990s and bitcoin is netflix. They would be smart to try and co-opt it now and incorporate it into their business model but most likely they won't address it until way too late. There are already exchanges being set-up in certain countries to facilitate remittances (Western Union's bread and butter).

To clarify, the federal government thought everyone should be able to own a home regardless of their ability to afford it.

This combined with market manipulation by whales and shorts spreading FUD has caused the fiat price to go down. A fix to the problem is being worked on and expected to be implemented soon.

Certainly the network effect with ebay is incredibly strong but at the same time there is a ton of potential savings. Somewhere in the range of 10% from what I can gather. Sellers and consumers will naturally gravitate there, probably a lot faster than most would guess. Even if it takes 10-20 years that really isn't very long in the scheme of things. And of course it won't just effect eBay but also Amazon which has a multitudes larger market cap.

Dumb prediction. It is not as if the sale of these coins is a surprise and most holders are probably happy that the government is divesting itself of bitcoin. Besides, it did drop in price somewhat following the announcement. 
The way I look at it is bitcoin is going to go through many bubbles before finding a price equilibrium. This day-to-day stuff doesn't matter much when you consider the overall long-term trend.

"Having just read today that transactions can only be divided by transacting them"
I think you are confused (or I am). You can send any divisible amount of bitcoin regardless of prior transaction history. Don't send more bitcoin than is necessary to any address expecting "change"!
Were you reading up on paper wallets? When you import a paper wallet to blockchain.info (for example), you have to import the entire balance at once. But you seem to be talking about something else entirely.

If you want to get around the regulations, just do face-to-face cash transactions with trusted sellers via LocalBitCoins or the mycelium app. You'll probably get a better rate versus an "ATM" too. 
I think we need to be promoting this option more. Bitcoin is about individual empowerment.

If you're in the U.S. the easiest and safest way for new users to buy BTC is probably to open up a Coinbase account and connect your checking account. This takes a week or so. I think if you have a VISA card you can buy small amounts instantly, but that might only be after the checking is already linked. Remember you can of course buy fractions of coins.
These days BTC mining requires very expensive hardware so it's out of reach for most.
I've never used a faucet but from my understanding most of them are legit in that they actually dispense BTC, but in such small amounts as not to be worth it.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

Bitcoin's central value proposition is that it is a currency not controlled by a government or bank, and is not able to be printed at will and allocated to connected cronies by corrupt central institutions. It is a haven against the inflation that historically has eventually destroyed all fiat currencies.  
THAT is why it is a big deal, not because it is a slightly cheaper payment system.

Incumbents already have a huge advantage, and co-called campaign finance reform makes it harder for outside interests to fight them.

Why would an altcoin take off where BTC wouldn't? Of all the cryptos, BTC has by far the largest market cap. It's the easiest to liquidate for fiat. You can already buy many things with it. It's simply the most recognizable.
I remember a couple months ago people started pumping "Sexcoin". It can be used for porn sites! they said. But porn sites will just use bitcoin. Not to mention the absurdity of someone who (likely) wants to use cryptos to discreetly purchase porn going to some shitty exchange (e.g. cryptsy) and buying "sexcoin" first. And of course currently BTC is the only way to purchase SXC (AFAIK).
Sure, future alts can offer new technology. But the bitcoin protocol can and will also be updated as needed. But it serves the need pretty well already. Think about the email protocols IMAP and SMPT. Has email really changed its core function in the last 20 years, or has it just adapted with the times?

Why don't you ask the company to accept bitcoin? Seems like a 3d printer maker would be likely to get on board.

Coinbase has hundreds of thousands of users and 10s of millions in venture capital. They're very trustworthy. It is mainly for checking account ACH transfers though. I haven't been able to use the credit card buying feature because it is restricted to Visa and I only have a Mastercard.

You don't really create a Bitcoin "account". That makes it sound like Bitcoin is a company, whereas it really is a decentralized ledger. However you can create an online "wallet" through a reputable company like blockchain.info.
But to answer your question, unfortunately no there really isn't a practical way to use Bitcoin with ebay and/or paypal at the moment. There are bitcoin-centric auction sites like  but that's a poor substitute (not their fault, impossible to replicate ebay's network effect).
However the good news is both ebay and paypal's CEOs have had kind words to say about bitcoin, going as far as saying they will "have to" implement it at some point in the future.

It is to create a paper wallet. Basically you use the site to create a unique private/public combo to use to store your coin offline.
If you're going to be spending them on the dark net I recommend downloading and using the Dark Wallet chrome extension to help anonymize your coins. You might also want to consider buying from a local seller with cash on localbitcoins instead of coinbase, if you really want privacy.

That's your opinion. The truth is that most people using BTC-E understand the risk and have decided that the benefits outweigh it. They have a longstanding track record of competence, something GOX never did.
There are probably some that use BTC-e and are ignorant of the risks. But who's fault is that? People have been conditioned to expect someone else to always be looking out for their own welfare (ostensibly so at least). That's what allowed GOX to happen. However, the world is changing into one where personal responsibility is paramount, and those who don't do due diligence, will have to deal with the consequences.

Nice to see they're starting to get sincerely interested/take it seriously, and I don't doubt the publicity is having an effect.
My dad called me up inquiring about how to invest after seeing it mentioned on CNBC. I mean it would've been better 7 months ago when I first mentioned it to him but oh well. My point is that BTC is entering territory where it is starting to appeal to the more mainstream investor risk-tolerance for speculative assets.
This past summer I was on the phone with my financial advisor (guy who manages my 401k) and mentioned BTC. He had no idea what it was so I didn't bother. He probably still doesn't own any but I'd bet today he at least knows what it is.

It seems unnecessary to do a "BTC 101" talk at porcfest. It is safe to assume that the vast majority of attendees there already know about it, and most are quite knowledgeable.   
Personally I'd rather see a panel on something specific like the future of bitcoin, the challenges it may face and how to overcome them, etc., rather than a talk that is not going to provide any new information to 99% of the people there. 
edit: speaking as someone who attended this year's Liberty Forum and was disappointed by the bitcoin related panels. Seemed like the speakers were just going through the motions presenting info anyone could read on wikipedia to a bored audience -- if I'm going to spend the time/money to attend I'd rather have an open and engaging discussion that actually gets at the core of what it all means.

Well, BTC is serious. We're trying to change the world in the face of massive entrenched interests. It's not a joke based off some (IMO) dumb internet meme.
I don't buy that dogecoin is more community-oriented then bitcoin. There are currently 313 bitcoin meetup groups comprised of over 40,000 people according to   That is a serious and growing network of real life activists.

What about the fake buy/sell walls that are constantly popping up? Some whale puts up a huge wall in order to get the little people to bid under or over it, the whales order/sell goes through, rinse and repeat. Seems like it happens over and over and even more so with alts.

Coinbase is well-funded, but even if they were somehow to go "bankrupt", that doesn't mean they're going to raid customer accounts.
The government might eventually raid it though, since it's a U.S. based company that you have to give all kinds of information to. Hardly anymore anonymous than a checking account when you think about it. 
Easier just to make a paper wallet or 5 at bitaddress.org

I think the benefits of increased acceptance and awareness outweigh it. 
Regardless, they aren't all necessarily doing that.

Sounds like you would have to set the teachers up with wallets (using coinbase or blockchain.info) and then fund those wallets with BTC. Then show them how to access their wallet and send the BTC to your daughter. 
They can't just buy a couple of dollars worth and have it instantly converted and sent. It is not that liquid yet, mainly because credit card transactions are reversable.

I think it will play out somewhere in the middle. Maybe in a hundred years the first scenario will come to pass, however I don't see government giving up the printing press (or their authority) anytime soon. The establishment is just too ubiquitous at this point. What I hope and expect to happen in the coming decades is decentralized distributed networks, powered by technology, makes government less and less relevant - so that it fades away slowly. And Bitcoin will be a big part of that.

Ask the seller how it works. From what I remember, you go to a CVS or Walmart, go to the cashier and them them you want a moneygram, give the cash, they print a receipt. Next to the register there is a red phone and you use the information on the receipt to call in and send the money.

You can buy btc with cash locally with localbitcoins and (I think) the Mycelium app just added a local trading feature. Expect to pay a higher premium than usual though.

This really could turn out to be huge. If Ebay/Paypal adopt it, that would force Amazon to quickly get on board.

You're not going to do better than Coinbase for the overall Bitcoin buying experience. Sure it sucks waiting days but that's ACH transfers for you. Just plan ahead; seems most are buying to hold long term anyway. Fees are as cheap as they come.

With Coinbase you can get set up and verified instantly by providing your online banking credentials, but it takes like 5 business days to do a ACH transfer from your checking. You lock in the price immediately of course. If you have a VISA you can buy a smaller amount from them instantly.

I think you're underestimating how much work goes into a large musical festival and overestimating the typical festival-goers interest in digital currency.
However, there already exists the Porcupine Freedom Festival in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.  - sponsored by the Free State Project and now in its 11th year. (June 22-29). You can buy tickets with Bitcoin and there are many vendors there who accept (or prefer) it for their wares and food and drink. The Overstock CEO is expected to speak there and no doubt there will be many other bitcoin related panels.

For BTC to really make its way into the mainstream, there has to be an easier way to purchase it. I liked BitInstant but it shut down last year. Just had to go to CVS or Walmart and send a moneygram with cash. No banks would work with them. You should be able to purchase Bitcoin at 7-11 convenience stores. (Not as crazy as it sounds -- they already have Western Union and bill paying services). It will compete with the VISA gift cards they also sell there. Someone will make it happen eventually.

Seems like it is getting relatively easy to buy in many countries across the globe via convenience stores and kiosks. The restrictive regulations in the U.S. appear to be more an anomaly.

It sounds as if they *are* planning on holding the bitcoins they receive.  
From the Coindesk article: 
Ranadivé said the franchise does not plan to exchange the bitcoins it receives for fiat currency. Rather, he said he believes the currency’s recent volatility will eventually dissipate and that bitcoin transactions and trading will become more common with time.
That's almost as big of a deal as them accepting it in the first place. No doubt at first it will only be a small portion of their overall revenue so they will still have plenty of dollars to meet expenses.

It has the potential to help hundreds of millions of poor migrant workers the world over, who are currently being fleeced by Western Union for remittance payments. 
But the real reason to own Bitcoin over fiat currency is because a decentralized distributed network, a trustless public ledger, is a much less corrupt and more efficient way to run a monetary system than the current banking cartel, and history will vindicate this.

I'd try and contact them directly about it.
Once things die down that is. Right now they have other priorities obviously.

Bitcoin is a nascent market. It requires a large paradigm shift. It is not going to bring about instantaneous results. Why would anyone assume otherwise?

Donate to archive.org instead. The wayback machine is better than wikipedia because it is a decentralized resource, plus they provide a public wallet address to send funds to (imagine that).

You don't need Bitpay or any processor to accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:25:33
Yeah from what I've heard those ATMs leave a lot to be desired.
Blame the government as usual. Hopefully we start to see more use of peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitCoins and the Mycelium trading feature. 
So you walked into the gift shop at 2am and there was actually people buying stuff with bitcoin? 2 girls, no less? Nice.
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:02:16
Cool. Now go ahead and buy it with Bitcoin (if you haven't already)!

Trollbox is ridiculous. They ban people for swearing because it is "unprofessional". The entire idea of a chat box on a trading platform is unprofessional and wouldn't happen on a legitimate exchange. At the *very least* there should be an option to hide it. Not to mention that awful 1 day chart.   
@_date: 2014-07-31 22:57:29
Sort of agree about Coinbase though. Decentralization needs to be pushed consistently. We're already starting to see these bigger companies using the government regulators to stymie upstart competition.

"Italy, they told him, does not regulate Bitcoin itself, nor are there any know-your-customer regulations, but any transactions above 999.99 EUR need to be reported."
Sounds as if there is a lot of room for growth.

Bitcoins sent
hahaha just kidding of course. pretty audacious of you to ask complete strangers for $1500+ to buy some gadget when people around the world are starving.
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:31:45
Around $20,000 versus about $1000 for the BTC dispensing only ones.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:35:31
You can send any amount of money to anyone anywhere in the world, nearly instantaneously and with  a negligible fee, without the need to involve a third party. Conventional currencies aren't even in the ballpark.

Probably don't want to make themselves a target.
At least they permit the apps for their devices, unlike a certain other company.

They might have been able to squash it early on but it is politically infeasible now and becomes more so with each passing day.

You don't need to download anything. You can use a web wallet. Coinbase is probably the most popular way to buy Bitcoin in the U.S. Open an account with them and connect your checking account. Make the purchase and they will arrive after the ACH transfer goes through. You can store the coins there if you want or for "cold storage" I recommend creating a paper wallet from bitaddress.org
You can also buy Bitcoin from an exchange or a trusted seller on LocalBitCoins.

not to be rude but this question has been posted hundreds of times in the last few days
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:35:53
I haven't really noticed it in the past but now that you pointed it out I am having the same issues.
Might want to let them know via support, twitter, or just cross-post this to @_date: 2014-02-15 03:11:54
These points aren't very well-thought out.
1. Bitcoin is _relatively_ anonymous compared to other forms of electronic payment and will be much more so in the near future.
2. Bitcoin is as secure as the user, and third-party exchange screw ups don't reflect negatively on the core protocol.
3. This makes zero sense. The government much, much prefers the inflation tax to a very hard to enforce "wealth tax" on digital currency.

I really don't think dogecoin is anywhere near as well known to the general public as bitcoin and that's not going to change. "Coinye" was more of a distraction but the lawyers got that shut down real quick. When the CEO of airbnb starts inquiring on twitter about accepting dodgecoin, then I'll be concerned. 
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:30:29
I doubt it. Not really necessary. They pretty much act with impunity these days given the complicit media and apathetic public.
@_date: 2014-01-08 23:04:55
Oh okay. I just wasn't sure if it was a different venture or not.
It's such a huge undertaking that it will probably require a cooperative effort between people and companies with all sorts of different backgrounds, so even with their lack of qualifications, maybe this "Mars One" effort will at least yield something worthwhile.

Great news. The less bitcoin owned by the feds the better.

This post is schizophrenic.
Doge is a scam. So is mint, whatever that is.

because for Americans at least it is much easier to get money into Coinbase than btc-e

Well if 400+ people are watching it. You're right it is probably inconsequential. 
But seriously, fuck gox. I look forward to them being swept into the dustbin of bitcoin history.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:21:41
Gox has been highly unstable and unreliable from practically their inception. This is like the 5th (and we can only hope final) major incident where their ineptitude has harmed the bitcoin ecosystem.

No. Seems like you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is.

That Bitpay is used for gambling? I highly doubt it, as a company they have been very discerning of who their customers are. Of course bitcoin can be used for gambling same as dollars.
@_date: 2014-02-20 04:12:25
I think technically but a majority of miners would have to agree to it which would never happen because it would devalue their earnings and probably kill Bitcoin.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:33:53
Bitpay and/or Coinbase
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:00:58
Just an incredible rise in such a short time, I wonder if we'll see a significant correction or if it'll just blast through $1. Either way I think it's fast become the best alternative to BTC.
