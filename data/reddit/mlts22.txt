If you visit their websites... there are none.
I'm guessing with BTC so high, the revenue from scamming people with a fake wallet app is more than the $100 per development account .

This is really our only option.  "Security has no ROI" has been the catchphrase for years, and it isn't going to be changing anytime soon.

After dealing with a new digital thermostat that decided to just go unresponsive after a battery change, I'd hate to deal with an IoT device with not just more abilities to fail, but with a sizable attack surface as well.  The ironic thing is (knock on wood), the bimetallic spring thermostat where I live just keeps on going, and has been for a long time.
Lets be real here.  If there is an actual -need- to connect to the Internet, IoT devices should be communicating through a hardened hub/firewall via Bluetooth or Z-wave, and initiating the transactions, rather than allowing another party to do the work.
However, what really -needs- an online Internet connection?  If one wants to collect logs, having devices write to a hub, and the log files be viewable directly from that or pushed to a server is one method.  How many people need real time communication to see if their fridge is at the right temperature that -second-?
There are also protocols that can be done without needing to be connected to the Internet.  For example, a door lock can use some type of OTP mechanism similar to BSD's S/Key which allows access to someone coming on site, but wouldn't require the lock to be online.  At the extreme, the door lock and a phone could be paired via Bluetooth or even NFC to exchange a shared secret, where codes could be distributed from subsequently without requiring the devices to be in communication.
