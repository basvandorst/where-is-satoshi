Most investors should hold their own BTC through coinbase (or something similar). Each share of GBTC represents 1/10th of a bitcoin. Accredited investors can buy directly from the management company at NAV (the price of bitcoin divided by 10), but buying them on the secondary market (regular trading) requires paying a substantial premium (due to both the ease of use for institutional buyers and the 1-year lockup period for those who bought at NAV).
