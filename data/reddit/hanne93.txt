I get your point but imo still oranges and bananas. Bitcoin was specifically invented in order to transfer money without an intermediary.
Ethereum was devloped to run smart contracts DAO's dapps and so on. Features BTC does not have. 
I've never heard anything like ethereum is trying to become a store of value (wouldn't be possible without fixed supply as it keeps inflating) or that it wants to become a peer to peer cash even though the "feature" exists to transfer value without an intermediary. 
Ethereum is supposed to power the ethereum blockchain like a form of gas not as a currency.
Also having alts and other crypto projects is obviously good. 
Imagen google being the only stock available to trade and rest considered shit because they're not as big as google.
People have different perspectives of course but it would be sad to see every altcoin purged and only BTC left to be standing.
Lets say BTC purges the alts BTC dominance is up to 99% 
This would mean there is only 1 digital asset to invest in which would most likley scare away newer retail investors and also push the BTC price through the roof.

ETH is not a bitcoin competitor. Bitcoin has gone from Peer to peer cash to a store of value.
Ethereum is neither peer to peer cash or a store of value.
So what you're really doing is comparing oranges and bananas.

I agree with that we don't need more "Gold" Bitcoin is unique in it's own way in this manner.
All bitcoin forks are sad and misleading but still drawing the same conclusion for the rest of the market is a bit disturbing.
Different investment approaches fits different people. 
Some people like to bet on the market, for an instance on start up business.
Some prefer store of value investments.
Some are value investors.
Some like to bet on cryptocurrencies but should they all be "forced" to invest in "Gold" just because it's dominating the market?
To be honest the market is very very immature and scammers are taking advantage of it.
But in the end it's up to every single individual to do their own DD, if u know ur stupid and get affacted by peoples opinions I'd say investing isn't for you.
Even though as a newbie it's easy to get fooled but once again if you truly did your DD it would be easy to spot what is a scam and what isn't.
If people are caught up in reddit reading BTC vs BCH trolls and make decissions based on that you deserve to lose your money honestly. The problem isn't that we have BTC and alts the problem is newbs buy lower priced coins in hope that they'll replace BTC because afterall it's a cryptocurrency just like Bitcoin. 
And buying the asset that has already made so many people millionaires aren't as interesting as taking a shot on something new that "could replace bitcoin" and make every one a millionaire.
Many crypto "investors" think just like that. That cryptocurrencies are a quick way to get rich quick, and this is whats feeding all scams and shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-11-07 16:34:08
and in the end... all "hodlers" are looking to "profit" in terms of USD as soon as BTC reach their appropriate target.  
Those who say they are not, are living in some fucked up illusion, that BTC will actually solve anything in the real world.  
AT ITS BEST it can be used as a reserve for issuing Fiat currencies.   
BTC In terms of real world adoption is screwed. its a dead model that needs to be improved 1000x to fit the critera of any useful currency.

It's not 900 B in alts. If you do the math current BTC supply X 86.000 would leave you about 1.53 trilion market cap for BTC alone.
If Dominance of BTC is Only 45%~ alts will have a market cap of almost 2 trillion

I have a few questions.
What does happend when BTC price rises again through the roof will we once again see $50 transaction fees?
Lightning network is exactly what and useful how? As of my understanding it's used for smaller BTC transactions with really low fees, but it requires a specific lightning wallet? I'm a bit confused here, (bear with me i'm not tech savy just barley average when it Comes to tech) 
But what exactly is a lightning wallet? I suppose it operates on a top layer of bitcoin (what ive understood from Reading a little about it) 
Why isnt all wallets lightning? And why isn't it used for larger transactions if it works good with low fees? 
What happends if bitcoin gets world adoption as a payment option, could it manage it? Is this still relevant or is it all about digital gold now? 
Disclaimer i own no Btrash or BTC my last BTC i owned was like 2014 when i used it to score pot from the deep web, however things seem to be more complicated now than then, why? All different wallets lightning network confuses me a lot. Fees &amp; debates between the community can also be a bit confusing.
Sorry if my english isn't top-notch however my questions are legit and please ELI-5

All right! Currently I'm not Home so i can't test it yet. Ill do a backtest as soon as i can and ill have a look on the results. 
The problem with bot trading is that it obviously cant spot fakeouts, and this is where my bot usually fucks up.
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:49:11
Well yes as for my personal usecase, but I'm also very interested in how other people use it, what future usecases we might be looking at that could affect the price in a good or bad way, 
It feels like there is a lot of untied knots for BTC, but i probably only feel this way since I've been following the discussion topics for the past 2 years, which has included a lot of Btrash vs BTC talks were it feels like some have valid points on both sides. However i do lack the technical understanding in increasing blocks size etc.
I suppose in the end im trying to figure out what exactly will bitcoin be used for in the future, is it digital gold, a payment system? Or just a way to unbank the banked it might be all the above but in the end could it handle full blown world adoption?
@_date: 2019-08-26 18:26:42
I don't really have that problem on my local bar but i get your anology ;) 
Personally i would prefer BTC over any form of payment because of the decentralisation and there is really no risk for the bitcoin network to run away with my funds like the bank are able too.

Oh sorry since I´m a "Genius" I should of left you with a "Retard" explanation
What is a Marketcap?
What is BTC dominance? 
Probably you don´t have a slightest clue since you´re not a "Genius" 
Here comes the explanation for 3 year olds. Hope you can comprehend it.
If Apple stock would be valued at 1.5 Trillion Dollars and have a market dominance of 45%~
That means the apple stock is equal to 45% of ALL THE MONEY IN THE STOCK MARKET.
So there is 55% left for all the other stocks in the market. 
If apple = 45% and is worth 1,5 Trillion, the 55% that is left would be almost 2 Trillion dollars. 
which mean 100% of the marketcap = ALL STOCKS MULTPLIED TOGETHER would be 3 - 3.5~ Trillion dollars Apple´s 45% (1.5 Trillion) + The rest of the markets 55% (1.75~ Trillion)
Just incase this was also to much for you, ill break it down to the ELI 1 concept. 
if 45% is 1.5 Trillion how much is the reamaining 55%?
Since you might get confused by the big numbers Ill leave you with an even simpler formula to work with. 
if 45% is 4.5 how much is the reamaining 55%? 
You should really consinder laying of your drugs. Speaking to you as a "Genius" i do not think you can afford to lose any more braincells. 
Have a nice one!

Drugs concern the whole pharmacutical market aswell, and yes drugs is the second most traded commodity.
As far for child pornography etc, how do u think the rich disgusting child molestors pay for their service? Exactly with their cash.

It depends on your overall financial outlook. I cannot tell if a total financial meltdown will happend today, tomorrow, next week, next decade or in a 100 years.  
What you´re talking about is a sinlge bank maybe a few failing during a recession. what happends at this point is that either Govt bails them out so they can stay liquid or they get bought up for cents by other banks that can provide the liqudity.   
Hence they´ll still be able to operate and customers will have access to their funds.   
In a total financial meltdown there would of course first be a recession that would wash out banks just like in 2008.   
If the crisis however continue, customers will without a doubt want to withdraw their funds from their bank account creating a massive bank run and a total financial collapse most likely.   
Why you might ask? Because banks don´t actually hold that much money that they manage let´s say   
BoA has 10.000 customers which in total has $2000 each on their bank accounts. This would mean that BoA manages $2.000.000 but what BoA really does with those money is creaing a fraction reserve so they can keep multiplying their funds.   
Joe deposits $100 into BoA, BoA saves $10 as a fraction reserve and create more money and loans with the remaining $90 hence creating none existent money out of thin air that isn´t anything else but digital numbers on a screen, This keeps enriching the bankers massivley but you will be the one to take the fall for their greed when shit hits the fan really hard.   
Do i really need to elabroate this any further? I´m pretty sure you can see the problem yourself with just having a fraction in reserve of what really is there.

Yall newbies has no clue how fast the price moves up and down in this bubble.
Let's say 100k is going to be the next top. You do realize that the top only lasts for a few minutes maybe an hour, there is no way really for you to determine this, as the price will most likley shoot from 75ķ up to 100k and back just as fast creating a bulltrap at this point you are just thinking ah a minor pullback ill load off on the next 100k chance.
Unfortuneatley it shoots up to 85k to come crashing down 25% on the day, the bear market is officially here and just a very few will notice it. While the Most traders/investors will wait on for the new peak that wont happend they'll have to settle for a 25 - 50% "loss" from the top most wont and will hold through the entire bear cycle once again.
Greed mentality is dangerous keep that in mind.

We're not in a bear market. Last year at this time bitcoin was around 2300$ the volumes was about 3 times lower. Bitcoin bubbled what we see is a correction, looking at the technical analysis from the 21MA we are actually in between a bear and bullmarket  so we have to see which direction we're facing.
Also because you were introduced to crypto around september - feburary and saw the bubble pop dosent really mean bear market. Try to zoom out and see the bigger picture before making statements Btc is still +250% since last year. In S&amp;P 500 you would be happy to see a return of 2-3% per year which would still barley counter the inflation of your invested capital.
