Ah yes, the [argument from etymology](

Another writer who doesn't understand that not being "backed" by a country is a major feature of Bitcoin.

Maybe you could use a different algorithm for summing votes.  Like maybe the square root of the total number of votes from any one user.

Can we create a bitcoin fund for Wikipedia to be held in escrow until they will accept it?

Regarding the auction, isn't it possible to determine how many coins are in an account?  Bidders could be required to prove they have access to a certain amount of money.

I agree.  The heading at the top is too small, and the spacing between links is too great.  The color scheme for upvotes is ugly.  I like the concept though!  Why no downvoting?

I agree with what you're saying, but don't be an asshole and open your post with a fucking insult.

In other news, the US government remains committed in its opposition to the rule of law.

Wow, that's awesome.  I'm glad someone had the same idea and then went and implemented it!

I'm upset at the US patent system too, but H.R. 1249 is not a terrible bill.  First to file is a step in the direction of simplifying the patent system, which is greatly needed.
This puts the US in line with most other countries - has Bitcoin been harassed by patent trolls there?

Here's an idea for a fairer distribution for Bitcoin 2.0:
Half the new currency is translated directly from the existing 21 million bitcoins.  They can be mined normally.
The other half is predetermined and is distributed among IP addresses, effectively creating a fair distribution among internet users.  I think this could be implemented, although interception might be a problem.

But it would be so messy!  They'd all end up competing over prices and features, and it would just be so confusing!

The way I understand it, the 50BTC is an amount set by consensus, and accepted because it's the default built into the program.  If half of everyone updated their software to modify that amount, couldn't it be changed?  It seems like it could be pegged to a bag of currencies.

This service looks pretty useful.  Will you guys need to charge extra in cases where the client is vague, like just asking for a box of chocolates or a fancy kitchen set?  Taking orders like that makes you sort of like an online personal concierge service, similar to what fancy credit cards offer.  
How much privacy will you be guaranteeing?  With the use of anonymous email and anonymously owned bitcoins, untraceable purchases seems like a big selling point.

Is there any way to use this computation for computation?  Can you manipulate transactions in some way?

I rewrote a little bit to put this statistic in the history, with a briefer description of Mt. Gox's dominance in the lede.  I prefer to have a more general description in the introduction to the article, with more details in the body.  Let me know what you think.

Awesome, I'm sure US government intervention in the Bitcoin economy will turn out well for a healthy alternative to traditional banks.  &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
