He sites multiple examples of other countries and border states that have already experienced their currency completely collapse.  These things happened.  People assume the american dollar is immune to this. They aren't recognizing the impact and manipulation that the federal reserve and governments have on actual value of currency and subsequent collapse.  Bitcoin is a solution and cryptocurrency is an eventuality.

How can you say were in a bubble without stating any facts?  I'm not saying we aren't but it seems unfair to just throw that out without any basis.

I noticed with Kraken that you needed to put the 0 in front of the decimal point. ie. 0.5 rather than .5   
Maybe that will help.

I appreciate your help but that didn't do it.

I hadn't thought about that.  That might be my only option. Thanks for the idea!
