I sold someone two bitcoins last week.  He was an IT guy who had a client affected by this virus.  He said the virus was  propagated through email, opened by their accountant, and it locked up all their accounting files.  Kind of sucked.  Hated that he had a bad impression of bitcoin right off the bat.  I don't know if this IT guy was doing a bad job, or if he'd just been hired after the fact, but i was surprised by the fact that this company was able to open up .exe files from their email, and had no back-ups or virus scanners.  I love bitcoin but it still sucks that this is one possible use for it.  We should definitely be prepared, this is the first of many scams that will come out in the next few years.

"There is no counter-proposition. It doesn't exist. You can't name one single large community, without government, throughout the entirety of human history."
How about the bitcoin community?  There is no centralized governmental agency regulating it, nor forcing your participation in it.  It is completely free to join or leave as you like, and you are completely free to do whatever you like with bitcoin and with the bitcoin community.  If you're a dick, your peers may ostracize you, but there is no one with the legal authority to use violence against you if they don't approve of how you act within the bitcoin community.
If that community doesn't meet your definition of large, consider the internet.  The world's largest single community, happily existing without threats of violence from a central authority.

You're not missing anything, you're exactly correct.  It's just that it's a pain in the arse to get money into BTC-E, which is why the price is lower than some of the other markets.  I don't think I have sent in a wire transfer to them (via OKPAY) that took less than 7 days.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:26:52
very cool!  i'm curious exactly how you explained it.  
i have been taking the approach of explaining that it's a giant public accounting ledger, maintained by a distributed network of computer accountants spread across the world, who all make sure their copy of the ledger matches every other copy precisely.  
it seems to be a good way to explain it to older folks or non-techies, because i think right now they feel like bitcoins are magic balls of cryptography floating in the internet, and that's not only incorrect, but hard to imagine.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:46:41
bitcoin is at $800 because enough people believe that the advantages bitcoin offers are such a great leap forward compared to our current monetary and payment systems that all these issues you mentioned will either change or be overcome.  They've bid the price up to $800 to reflect that optimism.  If you think bitcoin's advantages aren't enough to encourage adoption by spenders, savers, and merchants, then don't buy it.  
if you think libraries are better than the internet, flea markets are better than eBay, and snail mail is better than email/facebook/twitter/reddit, that's cool too.  i'm just of a different opinion.

if you are worried about price volatility, the movement of the price only matters as a % - the dollar value is irrelevant.  for example, people's 'wealth' won't be swinging dramatically on +/- $500 price movements if bitcoin is trading at $50,000, or even half that (though, i guess 'dramatically' is subjective).

To say "of course, but we also need to guarantee certain human rights"  by which you mean a minimum guaranteed basic income provided by the government, is a contradiction.  Such a scheme involves taxation - the use or threat of violence against one group of people to provide for others.  Violence is not effective at solving social problems, and it is immoral except when used in defense of violence.  Completely voluntary exchange with all elements of violence removed is the best way to lift anyone's standard of living, including the poor.

no price dip necessary, i'm just out of fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:29:43
I think market manipulation worries are a little overstated.  Typical big investors like hedge funds mostly try to get into and out of positions without moving the market too much.  
This might seem counter-intuitive to some people.  If a hedge fund takes a 5 billion dollar position by buying bitcoins at the market, it'll likely drive the price up $250 or so (just as an example).  But at bitcoin's new price, $250 above where it was 5 minutes before the hedge fund got in, there's likely to be tons of sellers looking for profits at these high prices and no buyers supporting the price with limit orders just below the bid.  The price will collapse, and the hedge fund will find that they'e instantly offside on their position.
The same happens in reverse when they're selling.  Dropping the price $250 in 5 minutes means they've got a poor average price on the bitcoins they've just sold.  
When they're bullish they use strategies (these days computer algorithms) for accumulating a large position while minimizing the impact of that position on the price.  When they're bearish they use strategies for distrubuting their large position while minimizing the impact of that position on the price.
This is what's in their best interest, NOT moving the market with their buying and selling.  Remember, they want to buy low and high just like everyone else!
Check out Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, a biography of the greatest trader who ever lived, Jesse Livermore.  He talks about this all the time.
Also, keep in mind when these big players enter the market, they will not be as likely to panic sell like all the amateurs that are in the market now.  They will instead take advantage when others do panic sell.  One more reason why more liquidity brings more price stability.

Just depends on your risk preferences.  Bitcoin still has incredible upside potential, but it could also go to zero.  Silver will never go to zero, because there are a lot of industrial uses for it in technology.  I think that the chances of silver becoming any kind of 'money' again are slim now that we have digital currencies, and that means that silver has less upside potential than digital currencies.  Precious metal as money would only make sense in a mad max nuclear war / destruction of all infrastructure type scenario at this point.  If it were me, I'd diversify between precious metal and digital currencies.

Everything else being equal, why would anyone choose to use a form of money that loses value every year, as opposed to one that gains value every year?
If we had a competitive &amp; unregulated environment for money, money that's expected to lose value every year would not stand a chance.  Money that gains value, or purchasing power, every year encourages savings, and frugality.  I hope it means we can finally stop living beyond our means through the indebtment of our children.

i think the sales pitch has to be profit.  the 30 second sales pitch is that there's a large and growing number of people in the bitcoin community looking for businesses to spend their money at, and being the early adopter merchant will not only attract the business of these bitcoiners, but if you're a big company, will get nation wide media attention (ie, copious amounts of free advertising).  the five minute sales pitch explains the low fees, instant payouts, and non-refundable payments (ie, the benefits of an almost frictionless currency as they apply to merchants)

It's quite easy to imagine a 2.6 trillion dollar market cap for bitcoin.  
The current market value of Gold is 6.5 trillion dollars.  The gold used in industry, jewelry and grills accounts for somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of the total supply, The rest of it's value is essentially speculation on it's ability to store value.  
The perception of gold's ability to store value, I would argue, is fundamentally based on 2 things.  First, it's relatively scarce, and second, it's historical precedence as an accepted form of money.  
To contrast this first point, scarcity, with bitcoin, I would argue that bitcoin's scarcity is much more assured than gold's.  It's assured digitally, in fact.  Gold's scarcity is assured only based on the fact that people think most of the easy-to-mine gold in the world has been found and mined.  
To contrast the second point, historical precedence, with bitcoin, i would argue that historical precedence always gives way to technical advance.  Unless there's a mad-max scenario, the world is not going to go back to using precious metals as money.  The conveniences brought about by the technological advance of bitcoin, in particular it's uncounterfeitability, it's perfect fungability, and it's almost non-existent friction, are just too many.
So, the mad-max scenario aside, bitcoin could take a huge portion of that 6.5 trillion dollar gold market.
But bitcoin really goes beyond this.  It's a currency that has purposefully combined the most desirable properties of gold, and the most desirable properties of fiat (which i admit, there are not many!).  Why on earth would it NOT dominate the currency market?  Everything else being equal, exactly who would choose to save their money in a currency that not only could be slowly inflated into oblivion, but also had an undeniable historical precedence for being inflated into oblivion?
There are four trillion dollars changing hands every day in the forex markets.  Hundreds of billions of which is just people speculating on which government is going to debase their currency fastest.  
There's at least 40 trillion dollars (USD equivalent) in government issued fiat currency, in the world, plus 7 trillion dollars worth of precious metals.  Is it realistic that the greatest form of money the world has ever seen will have a 2.6 trillion dollar market cap?  No, that figure is WAY TOO LOW.
It is going to crush the fiat currency markets and precious metals markets like the internal combustion engine crushed the horse and buggy, and talking about the dollar value of bitcoin will be as cute and antiquated as measuring how powerful a car's engine is in terms of horses.

Just an idea, but why not combine an ebay-style marketplace with a multisignature escrow service like bitrated, to outsource for free, the dispute resolution aspects involved in operating a marketplace.  I have to imagine the time and labour of resolving disputes is one of the most costly aspects of operating such a marketplace.  Bitrated allows third parties to mediate the disputes for you, based on mediator's reputation scores. Seems like a great fit (article on bitrated:

i'd generally advocate for a 'checking account' and 'savings account' type of setup.  I like blockchain.info with two-factor authentication enabled for my checking account, and offline wallets for my savings account.  Offline wallets are the most secure but not at all convenient for everyday use. i try to keep around 80% of my BTC in those, and 20% in a reasonably secure online wallet for spending!

After you acquire bitcoins... then it might be wise to store them in a brain wallet when you're on the move.  There are a few guides on it you can google, but in brief:
1.  Either run a full virus scan on your computer, or better, boot into a fresh install of Ubuntu off a flash drive.
2.  Go to bitaddress.org
3.  Disconnect from the internet
4.  Click the brainwallet tab, and choose a long, hard-to-guess passphrase that does not exist in any literature.  Best to use a cypher that you can remember (for example, take your favourite line from a play or movie, reverse the order of the words, cut out the third word, then shift all the vowels one letter to the left) - this way you have something you can re-create through memory, but would be impossible for someone to guess via a dictionary attack - you just memorize the phrase, and the rules you applied to scramble it.
5.  Click 'view'
6.  Send your wealth to the wallet address it generates
7.  Get your ass to safety
8.  When you're ready to access the money, repeat steps 1-5, but this time, write down the private key that bitaddress.org generates for you
9.  Import via a 'sweep' of private key into an online bitcoin wallet that you control (like blockchain.info)
It's more complicated, but also very secure, which is good if it's all your wealth at stake :-)

@_date: 2013-11-25 08:47:52
You're better off buying bitcoin.  For example, i bought a BFL 5 GH machine a while ago for $300.  Took 6 months to arrive.  Even though it runs at 8 GH, it still only makes me .01 BTC per day, at current difficulty.  
For those $300 i spent back then, i could have bought 3 bitcoins.  At the current difficulty, it will take me 300 days to make 3 bitcoins with this mining rig.  Considering the expected difficulty increases in the next 300 days and beyond, it'll realistically take me 3000 days to recoup that lost opportunity cost of just buying the 3 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:53:23

The thing i don't understand about the 'intrinsic value' argument, even if we submit that intrinsic value is not a fiction, is, /why/ does intrinsic value matter?  If gold was only valued for jewellery and electronics, but no longer as a medium of exchange or store of wealth, then it'd still lose 99% of it's value.  So, the intrinsic value offered by gold provides precious little protection for it's value if it loses favor as a medium of exchange / store of value.  
Furthermore, if bitcoin has assured scarcity, is instantly transportable, infinitely divisible, and free to spend, store and accept - with all those advantages /why/ would it fall out of favor with people as a medium of exchange and store of wealth, and have them going back to a more archaic form of money which falls short of bitcoin in all those categories?  It's like arguing that the internet is a bubble, because we might all decide to go back to using libraries and snail mail.  WTF?  People react to incentives!  Peter should know that.

This is not that surprising.  The US government is always looking to maintain financial dominance over the rest of the world.  They have realized that they cannot stop decentralized cryptographic digital currencies.  The next logical step for them is to accept it, embrace it, and take a huge stake in it.  They want not only the industry that springs up around it to be centered in America (internet based technology is after all, one of America's last great industries), but they will want to take a huge stake in bitcoin soon if not already, to secure their own financial power.  They are going to be taking a "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em" approach, it's the only logical thing for them to do to retain power.

10% personally.  All depends on what price you got in at, and how high you think it might go in the next 12 months.  25% is not unreasonable.  it's important to feel safe and secure about your investment, especially if you don't have much spare money floating around.  why not spend the 25% in BTC, on something you want instead though?

If you are planning to hold on to them for a long time, i would consider getting a 2nd USB stick and copying the password protected file onto the 2nd USB stick, so you have a backup.  Put the backup in a safety deposit box or give it to a trusted relative just in case you have a home invasion or fire.  You should consider running a full virus scan and then rebooting your computer with it disconnected from the internet before you plug your USB stick in and make the 2nd copy, just in case.
