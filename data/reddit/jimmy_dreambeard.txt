That's some great information, thanks.

Thanks very much, I'll speak with these companies. Asking them about the software is definitely a good idea. I'm not sure about them being a bank counterparty as it may require all the licencing to effectively be a bank in nations that have declared cryptos a currency or asset. I may be wrong though, I haven't looked this up. 
Maybe I'll speak to some accountancy packages and ask if they are brewing anything up. I really see these functions as being part of Sage and Oracle etc in the future..
But yeh, I'll post again if I have any significant successes or obstacles! :)

Thanks for the suggestions,  ill look into them

Well, we have many international payees and make a lot of foreign payments. Ignoring regulatory problems (which are not simple to overcome either), the advantage of Bitcoin is being able to pay across the world for free, and it only takes an hour. IBANS cost us approx $8 a transfer and take upto 5 working days. 
Bitcoin would allow us to save thousands a month immediately and extend our cash operating cycle by 5 days.
Edit: ah, you've added a bit about SEPAs. Yeh,  SEPAs are great and we have no immediate need to replace them really. The only advantage would be the operating cycle again.

If we were a smaller organisation then maybe we could skip over security and logistical issues to come back to it later and start trialing, but as we're a large organisation there is a lot of bureaucracy and potential points of resistance. This means we need to demonstrate certain protocols and security at the point of concept. We'll certainly start small though! :)

I'm not sure about this either, and it's a very valid point that we haven't explored yet. I suspect I'll eventually reach out to several exchanges and see if we can come to an arrangement, but they're fairly underdeveloped as far as I'm aware. I've heard second hand Kraken are backed by a German bank so I may speak to them at some point.

In business, the payer bears the costs of transactions. If there is a $6 bank charge the payer sends $10k + $6 so they get the full amount at the end. No one really accepts Bitcoin yet, so there isn't a precedent. My assumption would be that the payer would have to compensate for the payees cost of transaction back into their local currency, but that's just an assumption!

Thanks, I'll look into Armory. 
The problem with banks and SWIFT etc is they're expensive to run. They have to meet all sorts of standards and gain licenses (rightly so if they're taking your money on a promise). They can't really lower international payment costs without institutional change. If you can bypass them and pay the payee directly you're smiling with cash left over for a burger.

I've updated the OP to answer your question!

Our local transactions are free, but take 2-3 working days. European transactions are free, but take 3-5 working days. International transactions are expensive and take 5 working days. In the modern electronic era, this is ridiculous! 
We purchase and sell globally. In my personal opinion, the sooner the global economy has a global payment protocol the better, and Bitcoin might not be a permanent solution but it's the best I can see at the moment.
Aside from that your points are both excellent and interesting.  Thanks.
