Why is having one client a bad thing? It's actually a great thing as it prevents consensus issues. And weekly changes is normal for a project in development.. I'd be worried if changes were slow and spaced out to longer time periods. This shows the dev team is working consistently on improving the platform.

Counterparty seems like the way to go based on what I have read so far. The dev team is active, the platform works well, it is built on Bitcoin and finally it offers a lot of attractive options that the other platforms don't (and more coming).

Great post. I'll just add in that I believe true wealth is something we should all strive for, given that the economic system is designed to make us poorer every year. What is true wealth? Aside from health I would say knowing how to grow our own food, knowing how to build shelter and being able to survive in any situation is real freedom. We simply cannot depend on the structures that have been built around us because they all have central choke points. 
Bitcoin is one of the first major salvos built of many to come that will enable us, the people, to detach ourselves from the system that benefits the few only.

There hasn't been an alt as well run with as much potential as XCP in the space ever. More and more we're seeing serious groups doing serious things with the Blockchain worth investing in.
I'm a skeptical/careful investor and I've put almost as much into XCP as I did into Bitcoin and feeling really good about it. Sounds like a pitch I know, but the XCP team IS worth our money and support. Get on the train or miss it :)

Can someone the theory that more merchants mean lower BTC prices? If Joe buys something on a store accepting Bitcoin, he had to buy the bitcoin in the first place. So when the store converts back to USD isn't that neutral? Except:
 - Some conversions will be done outside of exchanges.
 - More exposure through merchant adoption should drive more user interest and thus more buyers of BTC.
Am I wrong in thinking all this is positive for the price?

I think what he says about the value of bitcoin fluctuating makes a lot of sense. A lot of people cannot keep holding their coins in a high variance market. At this point Bitcoin is more of a speculative instrument than something most users would like to hold.

Yea, again I think the space is a good idea but I don't really want to deal with physical locations and hardware systems. They add extra complexities that taking on on top of software would be a bad idea for me given my time and skill constraints. ;)

A decentralized puzzle game using the blockchain. Multiple users around the world can play the same puzzle game and play turns one after another in real-time. You could also have groups of users have a synced turn together to solve puzzles as a team without being able to communicate with each other.
The game would have to be pretty addictive of course and it could be refined, but I really like the idea of a bunch of people trying to solve a puzzle as one unit.. Let me know what you think if you have thoughts about it :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:22:09
I think exchanges and ATMs have huge potential but I don't like dealing with banking regulations or hardware design since I know nothing about them. I think there's def a lot of growth possible for those so yet another good idea.

I think the idea is good on the surface but then I think about what people think when there's a free option that's already widely used and then they see a paid one. It's a really risky proposition vs the gains users would receive imo. I also think people LIKE being asked out by many people! My 2 cents. Thanks for the suggestion though :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 05:26:30
Good point. :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:40:47
I think it's a great idea on the surface but two things come to mind for me to feel less excited. 1) Wouldn't the govt just spend the other 90% worse than they are now? and 2) Why settle for 10%, we want 100%? ;)
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:08:03
That's a really good idea imo. The bits could also be used as a way to raise money for non-profits (either optionally or through a set %/mo or special circumstances?). 
I follow Counterparty a lot and one of the cool projects they have going is like idea but for Facebook (Gemz). I personally think that increasingly, people will flock to more private/user-focused social networks.

Thanks for the comments!


Yea I've heard different feedback for this. My initial idea was the funds would be input, sent and the app would distribute the btc to all the listed non-profits in the DB. Either evenly distributing it or setting a % based on user preferences.
However I do think giving people the choice would be best, either by selecting a cause category or selecting individual organizations.


There's a donate button, it pops up a QR code/address, you send the btc directly or buy through Coinbase or a similar service. The app receives the funds and right away sends it off to the non-profits. No logins needed until I get Charity Status in Canada then I will be able to send tax receipts.


Interesting idea, it could be an option to add once the basic stuff is done. It could also be used as a shareable link so people can tell their friends "hey these are the causes I care about, why don't you chip in?".. 


Good point. What's the best way to confirm the address is legit? I can tell you it's been confirmed by the organization but that's still a centralized point of trust.. Is there a way to have a non-profit confirm without a doubt it's the correct address? Then I would just need to display the transaction ID linking to a block explorer to confirm the money was sent.


I'd love to support them as well.. however I wouldn't want to use fiat since it re-adds the same issues non-profits have now with it which is fees and sometimes lack of access to banking systems. The only way i can think of accepting btc for organizations not currently accepting it would be to use some form of escrowing service to hold funds for them until they accept btc.. it seems like a hassle, at least for now, imo. There might be a better way to do it though?
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:15:07
Good question. My approach right now is that I'll offer the best options to acquire btc that don't require me to hold or exchange funds. Unfortunately it will cost me users but offering that service would add a lot of hurdles and complexities.
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:26:04

Some countries are already using more renewables than other means. The technology and the roi is there, the problem is the governments in many cases, especially the US, artificially reduce the cost of fossil fuels by heavily subsidizing the already very profitable industry.
Basically it's a giant circle jerk that screws everyone, our air, our water and our healths for the sake of a few corrupt officials and oil CEOs and lobbyists.
Thankfully, we can do something about it. Get your voice out there! Put your $ where your mouth is: support environmental organizations, consume better more sustainable products, buy carbon offsets, etc.
The change to cleaner energies is happening, slowly but surely. We've got to do what we can on an individual level first. :)
