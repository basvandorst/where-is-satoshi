Point me in their direction if you can, I'd be very grateful. A public forum I figured would be a great place to meet these people and I'm not above a little work to sort the wheat from the chaff. I'm not taking anything on face value and I need questions from the public incase they ask something I had never thought of that requires addressing.

Well where else would you consider I start? I find mostly the same people here as on the bitcointalk forums and like any community there are those that know what they are talking about and those that don't.

Will do cheers!

That's a fair point, and certainly, if it turns out that all aspects of liability fall into 'grey catagories' I'll go ahead. I'm just hoping that by keeping them in mind from the very beginning I can save myself large headaches later down the line.

Well I'd like to say skill. The great thing about web based games is that they require very little resources to expand abilities, items, perks etc as they do not require the huge amount of artistry and programming that a traditional 3D RPG would require. I currently have over 300 abilities in the game, similar in scope to Path of Exile and how you combine them, coupled with how you move on the terrain plus abilities and skills that allow you to counter other players moves requires a lot of thought. It's more akin to chess than blackjack.

I hadn't considered going that route, food for thought indeed. Being a one man band currently it never crossed my mind, thanks.
I'm soon to be going self employed which will mean I can put considerably more hours than I do currently into the project but once I do I will look heavily into this as it really could solve a lot of my issues.
Thanks for the idea.

You may be right about the gambling and money laundering rules but that's kinda why I made the post, I just don't know.
As for player progresssion, we solve this by having 2 point systems that are invisible to the player. Although both have equal value in terms of adding to your characters power (and they are combined when calculating power/strength/abilities etc.) they are earned in differing ways (PvP vs PvE) so we can easily keep track of a players BTC value whilst allowing those not a fan of high risk permadeath to progress through the main game.

No, not at this stage but I hope to have something up soon. Until I'm certain I'm not going to run foul of not having a particular license or not adheering to certain rules I don't want to publicise it too much.

Yeah wasn't dismissing it, I didn't think about SL and it'll definitely be interesting to see what they've needed to adhere to as I'm sure some may apply to me. I was mostly reasurring myself that I haven't got a mountain to climb to get this out!

There is a slight difference. I'm not converting BTC to our points system and then back, BTC stays BTC at all times. We use the points so we can express player strength with parity to other players regardless of what the price of BTC does. For example, if due to price increase our initial buy-in drops from 0.01 to 0.001 for 2 different players over time (It'll track based on a fiat currency, £5 value for example) then you'd both still get 100 of our points to assign to your character. It doesn't protect users from their character having a drop in value if the value of BTC drops but it does mean that the game and balance is unaffected by price fluctuations.

Many thanks, will look to speak to them soon once I have a functioning game prototype.
