Syncing my Qt to restore my full node on this computer, few weeks behind, here's hoping for another 300,000 blocks!
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:13:41
I;m a subscriber of too, for a little over a week if not less, and it's fun there, I do not spend a lot of time there, but yeah I was pleasantly surprised by the place. I mine doges for kicks n' giggles too!
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:37:36
That's awesome! Cheers!
@_date: 2014-01-25 04:28:38
It'd be awesome if it'd work this way: Based on "how much is the bitcoin user willing to pay (in percentage) as fee", data taken over a timespan for say the next 1 million transactions, where the fee could be set from 0% to whatever %, not affecting the transaction speed during this period. It would need cooperation from miners and I suppose a good chunk of code and whatnot, but it would be very interesting and would give the devs an idea of how much in % are we willing to pay, then they could set the fee to float as a % based on the amount that was taken from the test time converted to, say, USD based on an average of all exchanges. Hope I was clear enough and you can get the idea.

Thank you very much! First ever reddit tip! nice! :D
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:01:35
yes it's not broadcasting, now to figure out how to edit that :S I'm a bit dumb today, cannot find it hahaha
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:01:14
Does anyone know somewhere I can buy my popcorn with bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:22:23
Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:56:23
I completely agree with what you said.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:29:50
blargh, going GOX way isn't gonna help you Bitstamp...
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:53:42
You didn't read the post, did you?
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:02:30
IF Google is going to get a cut out of those tips, then I could see that happening. Fixed % "donation". 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:50:19
My thoughts and feeling are with you all, do not do anything crazy, take care. 
A fellow bitcoiner.

I just realised, MK might get himself removed with stolen bitcoins, talk about backfiring...
@_date: 2014-03-11 11:17:33
Needless to say it's a crime in itself to remove this beautiful mugshot...
@_date: 2014-02-04 23:43:41
Have you thought that just as we had evolved from other species, there will be many products, protocols, ideas, networks, and niche communities that constantly evolve from Bitcoin's DNA? many of the proposed and/or already implemented protocols that go over Bitcoin's could be considered as an evolute or derived species from Bitcoin.
I love analogies, and my friend, I love you too! &lt;3
@_date: 2014-04-15 18:48:48
And all the while I was here thinking we wouldn't see any worse than Gox &amp; cia., how naive.
@_date: 2014-01-25 04:33:40
Just got that paper.li feed shaped out, hope you find it useful, if you find any source that you find irrelevant or some other you might want me to add it to, just let me know here. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:41:19
You are welcome! Enjoy!
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:21:54
Up-vote and thumbs up for the idea!
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:54:54
I tried them too, got code within minutes and on 1st confirmation, they are making a marginal profit which I believe is fine, considering the advantages, I am more than willing to pay for it. I wish they continue to deliver the same service and good business for them until steam finally accepts bitcoin.

Well, thanks you!

Is it now mandatory to get personal information verified to use coinbase? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:56:30
Stupid, but oh well... So far so good neonetheless
@_date: 2014-02-15 13:17:59
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:59:40
Done, hope it helps! You should add coinbase as a wallet option as well.

lol @ their office's pic.

 so demanding! 
@_date: 2014-01-29 12:06:08
No, not really.
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:50:57
Overall, satisfied with the hearing so far! I believe all this is good for future bitcoin adoption.

Fuck all this politicisation and random-asshatting of Bitcoin.

Oh, didn't know, well I clearly fail at stalking other redditors, lol

Welcome aboard! It's been a hell of a trip for me so far, and no matter where or in which way this will end if it ever ends, I'm not regretting it even one bit!

What happened to all those 400 ATMs that were supposedly being rolled out there a few months ago?
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:25:06
OT: lol I just noticed it's my reddit b-day :S 1 year around whew!!!
@_date: 2014-08-06 10:52:29
It's good practice to use one new address for each transaction you perform, in or out. I reckon that can be pretty inconvenient when setting up something like this, but I suppose it shouldn't be that hard to code the feature in anyways.
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:57:43
1 hour to go, getting ready to follow the hearing @ work!
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:47:33
So am I, hoping for more details to be posted about that soon.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:28:29
Congrats! it really feels awesome when you first send and then when you first purchase something with XBT!!! :D
Also, what is your ISP?
@_date: 2014-02-06 11:07:06
Gonna get Goxxed!
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:56:52
Have my up-vote for your thorough report!
And you should do an AmA, you seem to be willing to explain how all that stuff works.
@_date: 2014-02-07 15:01:51
Yeah, it's an interesting question, moreover when FIAT withdrawals are almost halted for the most part too.
I see peopl buying too, they might have hopes that they will be fixing this one soon so they are buying cheaper, that explains the buying, as for the selling, well maybe it's a majority that can take the money out or at least are willing to wait, since fiat withdrawals are taking a really long while to be processed.
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:14:21
That's hillarious.
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:53:33
no prob.

01/03 - :]
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:08:47
Remember the day bitcointalk accounts were compromised (bitcointalk hacked and down several days) coincidentally the same day Sr was seized and XBT flash crashed? 1st of October iirc
@_date: 2013-10-03 05:09:06
From people selling bitcoins for BTC on the same places, and yeah it's legal and you will have to get verified on most big exchanges (sent ID, proof of residency and stuff).
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:45:00
Exactly, not everybody "should be worried".
@_date: 2013-09-05 06:50:41
Sounds cool! Good luck with your business, and glad to hear you now accept bitcoins! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:03:21
Thanks for the info, and have my up-vote for your fucking awesome Ninja edit!
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:25:14
I'm not saying it didn't get hit but it recovered pretty fast and is back to almost where it was. (Although I'm still weary on the market and I'm not sure if we already saw the end of this).
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:13:02
Yeah, me too! and prices are good and shipping ain't expenssive.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:31:52
That is awesome! congrats to both you and the maker!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:36:58
You can try LocalBitcoins.com too!
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:35:46
Yes, that too.

Simply Awesome!

i mean bitcoins for USD*

Thankl you, down for a read on bitcointalk now
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:36:39
Also this is a very handy tool on days like that.
  &lt; EDIT: Typo
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:05:25
Well, now let's hope you will get your coins ASAP, I highly doubt they would guarantee you any rate, but let's hope for that too!
@_date: 2013-12-16 00:19:31
IMO Keepass is a better alternative to LastPass

I love when companies do as they just did here, come down to reddit, assume there's a problem and not only try to find a solution to the "bug" itself but also for the customer, I'm happy to be a Coinbase user!
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:38:28
It' was obviously because of SR seizure, panic sells and stuff, so yeah.

Here I'm hoping you can get your coins back, one way or another. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:01:16
I, for one, would like to see one of coinbase guys explain this for us.
@_date: 2013-10-05 03:08:02
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:58:58
IMO, you should recommend this person to use a web wallet to begin with, much more user-friendly for newcomers. No need to sync, no need to get on the techie part, less possible newb mistakes I'd say.
   ETC.
@_date: 2013-10-27 02:43:13
Awesome! So glad you have your bitcoins back! CoinBase FTW!
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:24:32
This is always risky and not recommended. There have been many instances where withdrawing directly fomr one exchange to another one ends up with the coins not even hitting the blockchain or going to the wrong address, pools also recommend not withdrawing from them directly to exchanges. I am not sure if this proves to be true to coinbase, blockchain , input.io or other online wallets as well, but  to remain on the safe side, I would always withdraw from exchanges to a wallet and then move them to another exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:43:12
Just do not buy Apple products :D
@_date: 2013-10-03 04:50:26
Mining BTC is not very profitable anymore, unless you can get your hand on dedicated hardware (ASIC Miners - you can google this, do not fall for scams and do some heavy research before going that route).
As for exchanging BTC for USD, there are many exchanges around that will do that,  (there are delays in withdrawals going on, beware)   campbx.com/ etc. (you can check a more comprehensive list here:

I agree, even if the method used might be deemed legal, they also keep people on believing it's safe for their own gain and at the same time avoid strong reactions from the public. I guess we'll never know for sure.
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:04:19
Funny indeed!

While I understand there's a need for sites like SR, I think bitcoin is better off without them anyways.

Yes you need a wallet to receive coins, be it online or using a client, Safest are client wallets like electrum, but for starters and if it's not a big amount of coins I'd go with an online wallet, like the ones on  or

You seem to be able to think, maybe even clever, i'd say that's a little too much to be part of 80% of the population.
