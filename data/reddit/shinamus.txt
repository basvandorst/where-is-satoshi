I disagree. 1 person no longer can control the market to keep it balancing on $14k. It is the entire market that agrees that the true value of BTC is $14k. This looks more healthier than how it all got bloated to $20k.

Japan is in dire need to get out of their debt hole, the influx of BTC might just help them.

Only things I can understand from your line of text is: ignorance. I am not here to scold you. You are pointing out things that are either irrelevant or just not true. Void warranty, yes this will void your warranty, but heee!!! Ever heard of the "restore" button. Press restore, and poof jailbreak is gone and your idevice also restores its warranty.
Virussses: if you are trying to download tweaks with the name: "Brazillian prostitutes xxx fartporn hardcore latina sexy" yes you will get tons of virusses. I have jailbroken my idevice for 3 years no troubles whatsoever.

Call me paranoia, call me skeptic. But I remember a time in Venice (cannot recall the exact date, probably around Christopher Columbus) people put their gold and silver pieces at the bank. They would receive a piece of paper stating the amount of gold and silver they have put in the bank. The bank screwed up with lending too much of the gold for interest. People lost their gold and rioted at the bank. So tell me, why would I store my bitcoin to the same system?

You are mixing 2 things up, which are inflation and deflation. This specfic thread discusses deflation. For example: 1BTC would buy you a loaf of bread in 2012. In 2013, 0,1 BTC for a loaf of bread. 2013, 0.01BTC for a loaf of bread etc etc. the BTC price increases you will get deflation. HOWEVER, there is a very realistic chance that the USD will collapse and we will enter hyper inflation. When the USD is worthless you might pay $500,000 for a loaf of bread.

Hi Bruce, I wanted to ask you something about the US Dollar. I have been reading and watching many economists on the US Dollar and it seems that the US Dollar's fall is imminent. It is unsuprising, because the Nixon administration stopped backing the US Dollar with gold.
The questions are:
 1) what is your professional and personal opinion on this (do you believe that this will happen anytimes soon)?
2) And how aware is WS on this and how are they are preparing for this? Or do they see nothing coming?
3) if US Dollar is going to collapse how will the Bitcoin world be affected?

Before you go and shoot me down, please hear me out:
I am true believer of Bitcoin. It will be the future, and is. But purely from a financial persective going all in on one coin is a massive risk. 
In the words of Wutang clan in a sketch of Dave Chapelle Show: "Diversify your bonds, nigga." There is much truth in their words. I would say diversify some of your portfolio in the top 5 except for Bcash (lol). Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and perhaps Binance.

Yes they do. Think about it, goods are not becoming more expensive but  the fiat money become less valuable. When money no longer is backed by gold, and the central banks keep printing money the fiat money loses its value. Since there is no stopping the printer fiat money will one day collapse. My take is that USD will collapse in our life time and you will be happy to have bought a commodity such as BTC.

McAfee's logic is as follows:
"The last bitcoin to be mined, oke there is ten thousand miners, the difficulty weight of the last Bitcoin is going to be  almost infinite, its gonna cost 4 to 5 billion dollars to mine that last [Bit]coin. And why is he gonna do it? The value of that coin is got to be more than the work put in to mine the fucker. So if it costs let's say even 1 billion dollars, alright it is a 1 billion dollar the last one, work it backwards and there and found out what the end of 2020 is going to be." 
He has a different view on the price. He believes looking it backwards and the price got to be 1 million by 2020. In fact, he say that it should be between 3 to 7 million dollars. But he plays it safe at 1 million. But the crypto community cannot look past their lunch let alone looking at the last coin to be mined. Interesting view, but I do not think it works on this community.

Muslims and Sharia are not equal. Many Muslim countries do not uphold the Sharia. Especially North-African countries. However, one thing is indeed for sure, interest is HARAM (forbidden, illegal). As far as I can tell BTC is HALLAL (allowed, legal). I compare BTC with gold. You buy a piece of gold and overtime it gets more value. There is no bank who is giving me any interest. Going through ways as BTC-E who is taking costs is HALLAL. Because a company needs to exist by providing a service for a small fee. HOWEVER, a muslim is obligated to pay ZAKAT (obligated charity) to the poor. If I buy BTC today I need to pay ZAKAT next year. This is 2,5% of my total capital. Bottomline: BTC has a great potential in the muslim world (AND PLEASE PEOPLE ISLAM IS NOT ONLY IN THE MIDDLE EAST, please educate yourselfs *sigh*).

I see it as follows: If I trade you my pen for your book, we are "evading" the currency by trading our goods. So the "currency" is 1 pen is equal to 1 book. Does this cause any problem to the Euro? I might even see it as strengthing the currency as it keeps the economy flowing regardless of paying with or without the Euro. With that said, BTC might be a new form of stimulance to the economy to flow faster. Though, i cannot say how this will be in a long term. BTC might eventually surpass the Euro. But I believe they can coexist. If you think differently or think my theory is poor, please tell me. I enjoy these disscusions :).
