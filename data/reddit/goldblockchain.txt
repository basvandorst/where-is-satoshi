It’s pretty hilarious, explains why it’s so volatile honestly. News was crazy good and the next day it was like bitcoin imploded LOL Forbes and Bloomberg don’t help newbies

Bitcoin isn’t taxed, Fiat profits from bitcoin are

It just doesn’t show, let’s say, if On a candle chart, a super fast wick. So if it was at 10.5 for 20 seconds it doesn’t show it on bigger time frames. Look at Coinbase pro instead

I mean, you’re assuming price has to do with how bitcoin works. Also, bitcoin is completely transparent so we could figure out what was happening either way. Just saying this post shows you don’t know much about all that.

Most people here don’t really know what they’re talking about honestly lol

Doesn’t really work like that. Wouldn’t be enough liquidity. If he tried to sell all at once he wouldn’t get that much considering the price would push to zero relatively quickly and lead to a fire sale on Coinbase. If he were to sell, he would use a OTC market, which is a thing for btc,  or a dark pool,  if there ever is one for btc. In all, people would lose their shit if they even saw his wallet funds move.

Nothing to do with anything, Coinbase’s base fee. Simple as that. Don’t store on coin base if you don’t like it, no one is forcing you to
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:05:04
Then it applies to you lol
@_date: 2019-10-03 16:55:00
Yeah they don’t really know anything honestly... not really in the real world yet lol. Most of my friends at college are clueless to the outside world

That’s not just one person, it’s everyone who has an order in at that price, and that’s the total amount
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:35:09
No one knows honestly

This was one of their best episodes by far

Don’t forget basic economics!

Relax, go by percents then lol he’s just asking
@_date: 2019-06-25 12:05:21
Well if you actually believe in btc then you’d be happy to buy more at a low price and not sell

Would recommend letting your investment feelings go

What a boomer
@_date: 2019-09-29 22:24:01
Cool idea but overall is just price manipulation. Wouldn’t change anyone’s thoughts on it really
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:45:33
It’s insane how much no one has a clue about this. Weird to me/us. At this point I just figure it’s because no one cares or gets it lol
