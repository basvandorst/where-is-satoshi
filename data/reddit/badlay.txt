I was asking about this. What would be the easiest way to for someone who speaks poor english and wants the smallest fees possible. Where should I send them to convert US cash in to bitcoin.

I work in hotel renovation and every tradesman but me are people from Mexico and south america who often send money home. I would love to be able to show them how to do this and make it cheaper for them.  
What should I tell them to do with their money to first convert it to bitcoin?

Keep working on it and google will scoop you up for 100 million once you prove it works.  I could see this being in their interest adding to the map/navigation app that already offers real time traffic. If they could do the same with weather, they would. Show them they can

Wow, cool! But it's an obscure crypto currency that is not bitcoin.?
What would it take to get bitcoin to adopt a similar approach? Besides life boats to save us from drowning in miners tears

Short guy here!
What the fuck do I have to do to get a pair of 29 length jeans!
How about a shirt that doesnt go down to my fucking ankles?
At 5'6'' I wonder what it is about the world that offers nothing in my size.  I assumed with millions of short mexicans making the US their home every year I would have more options by now.

As in "We strongly encourage you to pay 220$ for our people to plug in your lamp"
Chicago/Mccormick/Freeman dug their own greedy graves.
