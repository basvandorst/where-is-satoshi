Most maintainers of the status quo are angry, violent thugs.  We call them cops and politicians.

Corporations are creations of the state. They are registered legal fictions. An anarchic society is populated by people who associate and dissociate without any particular special treatment for certain "registered" groups because there is no state with which to register.

*facepalm.* Yes, your idea of human nature is the obviously correct one.  Your idea implies that the status quo is the only possible way that humans can organize.  Your idea demonstrates your ignorance of how chaotic systems like human social organization have an unknown number of local energy minimums; i.e. ephemerally stable structures.

Haha "Society" again! So we've come back there again.  Your silly abstraction that confirms what you desire and denies the same rights to those who disagree with you.  "Society" is made up of individuals, and only very small groups of them can come to a consensus.  Because you have demonstrated that you have no substance to your thoughts other than "My way or death at the hands of my tax-lords!," I cannot take you seriously any more.  I wish you luck in your education; I hope for your sake and the sake of your society ;) that you examine your opinions, for they stink of the dried blood, rotting flesh, and feces of a thousand democides.  If you are among the next group of most dastardly fascists like your tax-lords and the gestapo, I hope you are killed quickly, painfully, and with humiliation by those you prey upon.

Money is an efficient medium of exchange.  Many types can exist simultaneously. But, yea, try living by barter alone and see how wealthy you become.

"Transparent" hahaha!
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:21:26
Haha you're so primitive in your understanding of nature that you believe in "Good" and "Evil" as objective facts in the subset of "human nature".  You have a long road ahead in your education, my boy :)
I've answered your question thrice.  Words on paper mean nothing when a thug cop puts a bullet thru your head, tho you have not hurt nor threatened anyone.  
You still haven't answered my question!  From whence does your beloved "authority" arise?

"Majority consensus" is an oxymoron.
"Majority consensus is not mob rule minority oppression" is a platitude.

Obviously you've never heard of Diebold machines and nationalized media shaping people's opinions to suit the political elite, you ignoramus!  :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 00:03:22
There are no "laws of the land."  There are laws of nature.
There is no such thing as a "democratic majority."  You just mean a majority.  Nothing democratic about it.  Also, "winning elections" usually entails getting about 40% or less of the eligible voters' votes, by the state's own numbers.
When a person exercises self-defense in the face of force by state agents approaching with intent to take his or her livelihood and thereby enslave him or her, the state agents usually overwhelm the person and commit murder to complete the robbery.  But, you're right, if 40% of adults agree that the agents are just doing their jobs, then that justifies the murder  :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:00:37
"Society reaches consensus" haha yea everyone agrees with you 100%!  Ya damned fool :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:50:54


Obviously not!  Haha you make it sound just like original sin.  I was born and state agents labeled me "citizen".  I had no choice in the matter.  You're fucking delusional; i had a hunch you were a psycho when you didn't even know that you advocated license to murder by state agents.
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:00:51


Ah! So it was natural laws which gave Stalin's minions and the Trotskyites the right to murder 20+ millions of innocent people!  Also, every democide in history was totally legitimate because of laws derived from nature.  Thanks for clearing that up.
As part of the aggressors' club, you're free to leave, terrorist.  Enjoy your endless wars.
"Those who don't vote don't care about the political process"   Wrong.  Legitimate protest and unwillingness to participate in aggression.
The death penalty is implicit in your beloved "authority," terrorist :)

"Society decided this" hahaha TIL society is a sentient being with a single will!

"Pigeonholed an entire class" + "human nature doesn't change" hahaha this is gold!
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:29:35
Your idea of "modern society" is everyone in a geographic region under threat of aggressive violence by a state.  Fucking barbaric and hardly social.
"Corrupt Subsidization is a bad thing."  Brilliant!  Bad is bad, you guys!  You happen to be wrong that it's ok to force people to pay for a good or service that they don't want and don't use.  But, if you really believe that, send me all your money to subsidize my new car!  I give people free healthcare, so it's for the greater good :)  thanks you charitable guy ;)
Neither party A nor party B have any legitimacy whatsoever to rule people who haven't asked for it.
Say it as many times as you want.  Your idea of "democracy" is terrorism.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:03:26
I'm glad you prematurely assumed I capitulated because you lack confidence in your position. More gold!  :)

"You can renounce and leave anytime if you don't like them (unless you live in North Korea)."
   Wrong; the IRS will chase you down to take your money.  You sure as hell won't be allowed to visit family.
"If you don't like the vote, or think someone is going to eat you, you should leave."   If you want to force innocent people to do your bidding as part of whatever ceremony you like, you should go to North Korea.
"The state authorizes the use of force."   How?  They just decided, 'Hey, you guys, we get to use force!  Awesome!'
You should research how to be a decent human being by not advocating murder for those who don't want to financially support the same projects that you do.  Until then, you're a terrorist ;)
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:38:19
That's not at all what I said (oo aah strawman! you sure love that word).  The whole idea of voting to enforce ideas on those who never explicitly and directly agreed to be bound by a vote is something you are actually against, too.  Let me explain.  You and me and a few others are hiking thru the woods and get lost.  We begin to starve over a period of days and all of us decide to vote on what to do except you; you don't want any part of the vote.  The rest of us say too bad, and we vote 3 to 2 to murder and eat you.  The losers of the vote and you object, but too bad!  Social contract, brotha.  You're dead and taste like pork.  Not cool, huh?
Also, murder by state agents is always on the table for those who don't support wars financially.  Say you have an all cash business.  You only pay the fraction of taxes that reflects the fraction of gov spending you like.  Of course, the IRS comes after you.  You have your house locked up, so they bust in guns-at-the-ready.  They murder your dog in front of you then point their guns at you.  Reflexively, based on your military training, you act to eliminate the threat.  They murder you.  This is your statist paradise :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:03:44
The whole affair is black box. There is no way for you nor me to verify the claims of election officials.  Even if there were, there is no excuse for 30% to 40% of the adult population to dictate what the rest are allowed to do on pain of death.  Most people are easily misled into supporting aggressive wars and other ruinous programs by de facto nationalized media outlets. Those who don't believe the hype are under no obligation to go along, but if we attempt to withdraw support, we are prosecuted. If we resist this oppression, we are murdered. It's just as well that the site isn't allowing me to post responses immediately because I'd rather not associate with state-terrorism supporters such as you. Stop changing the subject because you can't provide legitimate arguments to support your points :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 23:39:35




Which people?  By consensus?  No.  


Oh, so some people write on some paper "Our employees get to shoot you to death if you resist this order to give us your money for this thing we want to do."  Cool, makes a lot of sense and that totally justifies murder!
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:49:24
Typical absurd statist argument. 
You implied it by supporting state agents' "authority".  You're a terribly weak debater.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:43:19
Oh, I thought you meant what you said. If you meant mob rule minority oppression instead of consensus, why not just say it?  Maybe the truth hurts too much.  It's ok, the sooner you accept it, the better off you'll be :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 02:31:25
You've been fed nonsense your whole life, and so have I.  The difference is that I figured out what was nonsense and got to the heart of how people interact.  Lincoln was an enabler of mass-murder.  He had the mindset of a wife-murderer but was allowed to exercise that power on a catastrophic scale.  I would not read Lincoln again unless I was feeling like I wanted to be disgusted by a psychopath.  Your poor debating skills have earned my pity.  I'm afraid you'll always be stuck in your statist fog, justifying aggressive violence against your innocent neighbors and suffering depression and confusion your whole life because of it.  You'll abuse your children and they'll grow to be monsters just like you.  Hopefully, they won't ever get to a place of leadership where they can encourage people to mass murder sprees like your beloved Lincoln!

Just reflecting your childish image so you can see how ridiculous you are :)


From whence came this "authority"?  Haha you're gonna say "democratic majority" again, huh?  Oh this is rich :)
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:49:28
Where does democracy really exist?  Is your vote on record somewhere? Can you verify that anyone with political power gives a single fuck what you think?  True democracy is ability to vote with your money and feet and to opt out when you are dissatisfied with a service. By definition, states do not allow anyone to opt out.  You justify destructive political practices post-hoc because you're too scared to admit your total lack of power. No one in power gives a shit what you think :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:53:25
You pigeonholed all humans under your idea of human nature. That is completely absurd.  You haven't made any arguments. You just make assertions. If you make an argument, I'll respond in form. Until then, I'll continue to be entertained by your internal contradictions :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:48:56
Democracy doesn't exist except in groups of people smaller than about Dunbar's number; ~150 people or less.  This is because, in order for true consensus to take place where everyone agrees to something freely (not under duress), everyone in the group bound by the decision must feel the negative effects of the decision if they arise.  They can only feel this if they know and work with each other personally.  Otherwise, we have your idea of "democracy" which is really just some people imposing their will on others and reaping the benefits while the rest suffer in ignorance of the true purpose of the fascistic "laws" and "regulations".  In your "democracy," business leaders with friends in govt pay for laws which subsidize their business at the expense of the non-politically-connected.  You see, the word *democracy* means "rule by the people," but all you have referenced are states which are "rule by some people".  The very existence of a state implies a lack of consensus.  I can't speak for all people who call themselves ancaps, but decent people don't like to be extorted and lied to about the true purpose of states.
