I agree.  There seems to be a concerted effort in my opinion on pieces like this.  
You know it's pure bullshit, when they say, "a currency nobody understands."
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:42:46
I agree with you in the long run.  We gotta get past these stages now though.
We have to get more folks using it...a LOT more folks.

Have you lost your mind?  I'll tell you one use I just made a week ago and plan on doing again.  I paid a Mexican programmer in btc for some coding needs I have.  
Honestly I had my doubts until then.  Now I realize bitcoin is IDEAL for paying for cheap foreign labor that can be done on the computer.  This should be a big concern for programmers and really anyone who's work can be done remotely.

You haven't lost anything until you sell.  There are less than 11.5 million bitcoins in circulations and this will never get over 21 million.  
The only question is WILL bitcoin be accepted long term as a currency.  Nothing else matters.
@_date: 2013-06-26 06:00:34
Come on Buttercoin, OpenExchange, Metalair and others.  WE need to get these p2p exchanges going.
Let's see them stop person to person bank transfers or paypal transfers--the dirty fucks.
Any of you that think bitcoin is NOT under attack is insane.  Stop kidding yourselves folks.  Go make donations to the p2p exchange services.
@_date: 2013-07-12 01:08:38
Don't know about for Iphone but I get my bitcoins from coinbase.com.  They are the most trustworthy imo and they now allow instant purchases after you buy from them once, thirty days pass and you verify yourself.

Fiat money robs people of their retirement.  It forces them to "invest" instead of earn and save.  
Moving over to gold or bitcoin/alt coins with a cap will allow people to save again for their retirements.

Says the bagholder.
You can't stop panic with posts like this.  It's the nature of the market.
Now, perhaps if would stop removing posts about the price going down, the community could recognize it and create solutions to keep it from being gamed so heavily by the powers that be.

People will simply use one of the many other alt currencies as the value increases.
All the digital currencies, if run honestly and openly will have value.
New digital currencies will be used to offset any perceived stagnation of currency.

That's pretty cool actually.
@_date: 2013-06-22 04:09:35
Actually I didn't.  I just saw a commercial for them a sec ago as I was creating a new account.  
I do see the fun that can be had with novelty accounts now though.  
Really though, I just did a Youtube search of bitcoin and this guys video came up.  It might be true.  Who knows?
It would make sense for them to get on something cutting edge given how they are trailing in everything else.

This political bashing doesn't help bitcoin in the least.  Bitcoin shouldn't be someone's political football.
The TRUTH is ANY power that becomes too large is dangerous.
The world's governments are mere puppets to the central banks and their shareholders.  The "free market" created the central banks.  So is the "free market" bad? No.
Too much power of any type in a few hands is bad in my opinion.  You can't regulate out of that either so it's really a complex situation.  
The bottom line is we simply shouldn't label ourselves based on some ideology.
@_date: 2013-07-13 03:20:59
In truth, you are never "sending" anything.  An adjustment is made to the blockchain that is updated on all copies.
@_date: 2013-07-07 11:13:29
I think this is perfect.  Your friend can get payments from far away and she is promoting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:27:38
Lol...it's not the daily churn.  It's the long term downward trend that concerns me.
Bitcoiners need to do a better job of promoting it's usage imo.  The more people actually using it, the less this will happen.
Also, most bitcoin companies are extremely selfish.  Those hoarding a ton of bitcoins need to do more than form their own little companies around buying and selling, they need to spend some damn money promoting with the goal of getting new businesses to use it.
@_date: 2013-06-23 15:27:10

I briefly looked at this but this seems like an avenue anyone could take to sell bitcoins--through Obopay?  
Maybe that's the direction these companies should take?

It's going to go so high and so long.  EVERYONE will see how high it is and they will want it because it's huge.  They'll look at it with their mouths watering and they'll want just as much as everyone else.   
When it get's that huge no one can deny it anymore, you can try to hide it but it'll just bulge right out of whatever you throw on it.

If you were central bankers how would you destroy bitcoin if you deemed it a serious threat to your wealth? 
Why not quickly open a fake exchange to give the appearance of a sudden drop in value to bitcoin?

I have NEVER had a problem like this.  I don't think they do this AT ALL.  It would ruin their business.
Something else likely happened.

When you keep seeing a lot of sells and far less buys it creates a sense of panic.  Yes people buy, but the price keeps going down.

I like alts.  Personally, I like GoldCoin.  It has the best name for normal consumers.
Personally I think eventually all govt backed money will be virtually worthless and almost ALL the current alts and bitcoin will have value.  If they keep up the development work and mining.

If your country does not have an easy way to buy and sell bitcoins like Coinbase in America then there is HUGE problem.
Isn't it interesting how America snuck that one in right during their big FINCEN propaganda push.  They are talking out of both sides of their mouths and the rest of the world better not listen.

This is a great idea.  Could you sell bitcoins and not be considered a money exchanger since you don't offer them to get dollars back out?
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:38:13
Yeah...I just checked it out too.  It's real.  I have a 50BTC daily instant limit.  
Things just got real.
Bitcoin is going to explode now once a few other exchanges come online.
So through coinbase you can register your bank instantly via online credentials, you have to make a purchase I think though and wait a month or so before the stage 2 verification which is just a series of questions--last 4 of social and a few others.
@_date: 2013-06-27 19:33:04
Yeah...global currency holding steady at 100 bucks while detractors have been claiming it's dead for a few years, yet it keeps picking up steam.
Nothing to see here folks.  I tell you what though, sell me your bitcoins for 20 bucks a pop if you like cause truly they are worthless....OK?
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:40:52

In a month probably coinsetter.com.  Coinbase.com has a limit I think so maybe another exchange.  I'm not sure.
I don't have those kinds of "problems".  :)

I'm 41 and I can tell you emphatically that a country's currency and it's management should be their number one concern.  
It's very nice for US citizens that the dollar is the world's reserve currency.  It's nice to be able to print it and force other nations to accept it in many, many various ways.  Most countries do not have this luxury.  
Bitcoin is absolutely a viable option.  It should likely be a secondary currency at this point though since there are no real mass produced ways to exchange coin without at least a cellphone.
@_date: 2013-07-09 03:13:08
I think it will help keep the bankers and regulators honest.  It's always an option--just waiting on the sidelines for them to fuck up just enough for people to either use it as leverage (we're considering switching to bitcoin) or just to make the wholesale switch.
Watching, waiting, biding it's time.  Growing...creeping.

Bitcoin is anonymous.  The exchanges are not.  That's the government rub.
Now if you walk up to me and say, "Hey, I'd like to buy some bitcons from you", create your own address and I send them to you for cash then you can't get much more anonymous than that.
@_date: 2013-07-12 15:42:22
You MUST create your own address man using Bitcoin-QT or another such client or even a paper wallet.  Google it.
Transfer your bitcoins to this address.  DO NOT store them on coinbase or another online wallet.  What if coinbase closes or the government seizes their assets.
Be your own bank brother.

Give me a break with your fear tactics.  If they want to dump their bitcoins, they'll just do it on the markets.  They own about 11,500 bitcoins or 1% of total coins.  They could dump that in a week easy without affecting the market.
@_date: 2013-06-24 01:02:24

Bitcoin is under attack on many fronts.  It may not survive.  I know folks don't like to think about that but it is true.
Regulation is just an attempt to slow the movement of value into bitcoin.  
I'm not sure about coinsetter.  I thought it may be a positive thing but who knows.  This may be an attempt by the govt. to manipulate the prices.  If it is, we won't have an option to combat it before they drive it to zero.
Sounds nuts I know but don't think these guys aren't exploring ALL options.
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:38:04
This subreddit circle jerks too much and needs to stop with the constant "BITCOIN is UNSTOPPABLE message." 
All this does is prevent people from helping get it where it needs to be.
Maybe delete messages like "sell now".."panic", etc.   Messages that offer no reasons or solutions.
I think it does bitcoin FAR too much harm to pretend it's not vulnerable.  Let us group think and fix some of these issues.
