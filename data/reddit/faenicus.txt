Nope, I standby my comment.

No that's not how stock splits work. It's exactly the same as the way forks work. The terms of stock splits set the units you receive. Some are 1:1, some are 2:1, 3:1...etc.

If you held the forked coins you have nothing to worry about. If you sold, you report gains with zero basis. I don't foresee anyone considering the issuance of forked coins as income.

I would disagree. This is more closely comparable to a stock split not stock compensation. Furthermore, the IRS doesn't have the resources to audit standard 1040s (individual tax returns), let alone the resources to be digging into crypto. The percentage of filed returns that get audited now a day's is laughable. 
And finally, aside from coinbase, how is the it's ever going to track the wallets that received forked coins and not only find the wallets, but find the actual US citizen who owns that wallet.

I mean, if you want to report extra income and pay more taxes, god bless. At the end of the day it's all very similar outcome because if you report the ordinary income, you would claim that as your capital gains basis when you do eventually sell it. The other method would report your full gains with zero basis. There's a slight difference due to capital gains vs ordinary income rates.

Turns out Jeffrey Epstein was funding his operations through Bitcoin and now it's all collapsing

Buying a good or service is the same as selling to fiat in the eyes of the IRS. As soon as the transaction for the car is completed, you have a gain to report.

Coinbase shows (and I'm sure stores) the value of Bitcoin at the date you purchase it. You should also be doing your own due diligence by recording the value at date of purchase. If you cash out through coinbase, they also show you the current value of Bitcoin when you sell it, therefore you can calculate your gain (and coinbase can theoretically report it to you/irs).
How much tax to pay is a different question, because it depends on your personal tax situation and bracket.

I think you are misinterpreting this. This letter is one financial advisor informing his clients that his firm will not partake in the futures trading. CBOE has not cancelled anything.

The taxable events are: crypto to fiat and vice versa. And crypto to crypto. Wallet to wallet of the same crypto will have no tax consequence.

To answer your question: Yes, the IRS is notified if you were to invest in mutual funds. They collect data directly from financial brokers. That being said, no action would come until you realize gain/losses. The same will go for crypto currency.

Actually a lot of people do know. It's your responsibility. If you can't substantiate the basis, you will probably pay tax on 100% of the sale price. Shapeshift has a database and history to pull historic values as well. I highly recommend you start accumulating basis figures. 
The IRS requiring coinbase to give user details is literally what you put as your  step, so not sure where you're going with that...
Regarding your point about reports that show estimated tax due, that is never going to be done by a financial institution (or coinbase or any exchange) and is not done for any fiat investment. That would be handled by a personal tax accountant, once you provide them with your basis figures.

Brokers report both the cost (basis) and FMV to the IRS. It has very little to do with timely filing and everything to do with tax avoidance. If Bitcoin millionaires paid their rightly owed taxes, we wouldn't be in this situation in the first place. I don't agree with what the IRS is doing, but I also don't agree with the people trying to hide their gains/avoid taxes.
That being said, if the IRS is unwilling to see Bitcoin as a currency/investment, there really is no reason for them to come after Bitcoin holders. It's hypocritical.

That is such a grossly inaccurate statement. Take some responsibility. Track your own investments. The actual tax outcome is of course more difficult and would make sense to have a tax accountant calculate that aspect. But saying that you don't know your basis or sales price without coinbase telling you is absurd.

Just replied to a similar thread...I think you are misinterpreting this. This letter is one financial advisor informing his clients that his firm will not partake in the futures trading. CBOE has not cancelled anything.
