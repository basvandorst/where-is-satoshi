changetip works on those platforms now? i mean you'd probably have to be relatively successful to get tips on them but i didn't know that.

hold on to it through volatile and not so times, i learned this the hard way when btc crashed and i had some pocketed away (2 btc) only to find out later that within a month it had risen in price.

yeah but how do you find people that are giving away tips is what i wonder, i mean is there a way that you can connect with people via those platforms? i realize a lot of new people might not understand what a bitcoin is even and waste the tip, so how would you present that to people on that media?

Oh ok I was wondering how that whole thing would work, wouldn't want bits just floating around in the air.
I like the idea, and I wasn't trying to imply that people are just tipping for no reason at all, it's great there are people trying to get the word out about bitcoin not that it doesn't already have enough of it, integrating it into different services also would help big time.

The site is legit I've done business, but if anyone asks you to meet in a local area if that were an option I would very careful about it. Especially if they were to say "meet in open area" etc etc. It's kind of like anything you would do if you were to trade goods on say like Craigslist, use extreme caution, please!
