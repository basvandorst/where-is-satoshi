it's not the wrong time don't worry :)  i bought at 2140. and yesterday when my husband told me to go buy more again at 2350, i said no way gonna wait!   ��  i feel guilty right now and i will most likely get an earful by tomorrow .

wow .. what a great story . and the kid that you met through game is surprisingly nice to you. i wish i met people like that these days . but so far i've bumped into 2 scammers that stole my money after sending them the cash to help me buy btc.

have you tried libertyx? i am new to btc a month ago and i paid ridiculously interest fees and transaction fees on the exchange. then i just went to local store from libertyx yesterday  . different place has different fee but mine was 7%. no verification at all!  it was so smooth and easy i got mad at myself for not going there earlier! some places i know in california only take 3-5% ..

i'm sorry first for my ignorance questions but i'm really curious about the future of bitcoins. i understand that bitcoin was created for the people since most of us are no longer have trust in the government etc .. 
if bitcoin is going to the moon in the next ten years .. what would happen? would the government get involved ?  would it be taxable ? how are we going to get away with the IRS with our hodlings. some business right now accept btc as a payment. how do they calculate the sale tax and report that later on ��
