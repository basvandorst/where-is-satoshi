Can I get electrum for my android?

I've heard jaxx is also pretty good. I just downloaded it. I think I'm gonna use that one since ive also invested in litecoin. But thank you very much for your help.

Does it allow me to store other cryptos like ethereum and litecoin as well?

Ok so its mainly for the transaction costs. Got it. So you think electrum is a good desktop wallet? Would you recommend having both a mobile wallet AND a desktop wallet for bitcoin?

Now I downloaded coinomi, and it says that it accepts bitcoin. Why do you suggest I use electrum for bitcoin and not this?

Isn't my bank account going to get flagged if I keep trying to purchase something that doesn't go through?

I finally got an email back from coinbase saying that it is a problem with my bank. So I am gonna give them a call tomorrow see what the fuck is going on cause i have tried six times and total and it keeps getting rejected.

Sounds good. I am in the middle of fixing up my situation with coinbase so if that still doesn't work i'll just use cex.io

will look into it. Thanks so much friend.

I have tried to buy bitcoin on 5 occasions and coinbase kept cancelling my payments. I've tried to cancel my account but it won't allow me to. Everytime I click close my account it says "You can't complete the account closure quite yet".

So i made sure that i transferred enough money to my checking initially. It made sure that my debit card was ok to go through. Then when I made a transaction it said success, and then i keep immediately getting emails after everytime i try that it has been cancelled. I'm gonna stop doing it for a bit maybe try in several days or call my bank.

coinbase is canceling the transaction.
