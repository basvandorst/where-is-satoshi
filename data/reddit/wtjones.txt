@_date: 2017-12-22 16:15:32
The question is, can Bitfinex print enough Tether to prop the price back up now that futures are viable?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:18:46
The coin that the majority of people decide to use will be the one that wins and eventually the most valuable. Bitcoin will not be that coin.  It’s like saying people will be clamoring to use the Nokia 3310 today. Bitcoin is the Nokia 3310 of crypto.

Half a million dollars spread out between 5,000 people is hardly a game changer. That's 3 trips to the bar or one pair of shoes each. If 20 establishments got the entirety of the money it would be enough to hire one part time employee each. If you spread it out over 100 establishments it's hardly a blip on  any individual radar.  It may not be worth the time and effort to train your staff  for a  shot at $5,000. 
My guess is most of it will end up as Amazon or Whole Foods  gift certificates via Gyft. Another large percentage will end up in the hands of hoarders who think keeping it out of circulation is a sure fire way to drive the price up.  And whatever's left over will end up  sold for fiat by the one or two bars and computer stores that take a shot on accepting it through Bitpay.

Can we stop talking about how this isn't an issue? I take Bitcoins at my business and have for some time. I'm not that worried about this. That doesn't mean we shouldn't fix the problem if we can. 
I get that the devs don't want to rock the boat but in order maintain its position as the "best" coin it needs to be technologically superior to altcoins. There are tons of altcoins that are creating good proof of concepts for BTC devs to steal and make Bitcoin better.  
This bury our heads in the sand attitude about issues like confirmations taking too long to confirm, double spend vulnerabilities, the concentration of power of a small number of miners, etc. eventually is going to lead to reduced confidence in the coin.

What is this community doing to drive demand? Please give concrete examples. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:13:15
I should have used the word exchange.  Regardless, an exchange losing this kind of money doesn't inspire confidence.
 Exchanges are an important part of the economy now and in order for the currency to flourish people have to trust that they can, at least temporarily, leave their money in exchanges without it going south.  
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:07:29
That's a good way to push demand down.

I said: 


I never said that consolidation was going to reduce demand. But fewer people, by definition, reduces the userbase. If a big part of what makes something valuable is userbase and that userbase is diminishing so is the value.

It's still a GIANT waste of energy a day. Something like $2,000,000 worth of electricity a day is wasted mining BTC.

The rational reason that bitcoin will plateau is that demand for Bitcoin has begun to decline. Look at the volume charts  
This community has given up on trying to increase demand and instead is focusing on driving down supply as a means of increasing price. This is a terrible idea for an internet technology/currency. \

Anonymity (r/drugs, etc.)
Fuck Paypal (r/merchants, r/minecraft, etc.)
Ease of use in small transactions (r/techsupport, r/autos, r/diy, any subreddit where you would like to give people a monetary incentive to answer your questions.) 
Ability to buy what they'd like (r/gambling, r/sportsbook, r/drugs, r/steroids, etc.)
Early Adopter Cred (r/gadgets, etc.)
Speculation (etc.)
Gamblers (covered above).
I'm sure there are plenty of subs I don't know exist and y'all will be more than happy to fill me in on them. I'm also sure there are things I haven't thought about yet and I'd love to hear about them as well.
I say we make a list of the subs and messages for each sub that we can make the biggest impact on and use u/jitty's idea of spreading the gospel with bitcointip. 
There was a semi-scavenger hunt in last night that guys in the r/puzzle, etc would probably like. This is a relatively cheap way to spread the word. It also has the potential to make or some other front page worthy sub.
@_date: 2013-02-14 16:59:09
You're right. I was thinking about this after I posted. Merchant needs to make the transaction from BTC to USD automatically as he receives payment. Setup a script that sells coins at MTGOX for USD in conjunction with every transaction.

Any economist worth his salt will tell you it's only possible to see a bubble in hindsight. 
Please give me numbers that backup your statement that there's isn't enough of a market to back up a $2bn capitalization? 
How many depositors would a bank need to justify a $2bn market capitalization? The average bank branch has $50M USD in deposits so we'd need roughly 40 bank branches worth of depositors to justify a $2bn market cap. That's a small regional bank's worth. 
To put this in context Wells Fargo has $843bn in deposits and Citi has $800bn. I'm not saying the "bank of BTC" is ever gonna get that many but the potential is definitely there. 
If you have numbers to refute this I would love to see them because I'm desperately looking for someone to convince me that I'm wrong. But this has to be bubble look at the chart, isn't even an argument. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 06:28:08

Bitcoin gambling is so much simpler to cash into and cash out of. If some ingenious marketer would go out and market sites like sealswithclubs.eu, bit365.eu, blockbet.net, satoshiroulette.com, etc. aggressively people would be quick to adopt BTC for their gambling needs. 
Cash on and out on SWC takes les than half an hour. It can take days or weeks on the sites available today. 
Sports betting where you don't have to create a login or leave your money on someone else's possession? Yes, please. With bit365 and blockbet you send your wager to an address associated with said wager. If you win they send the agreed upon win back to your address. Similar experiences with Satoshiroulette. It's so simple you forget how much you're losing.

What we know is that there is a reliable anonymous currency in the world and people are beginning to use it as a trading tool. The majority of the world doesn't know that. The majority of new buyers don't realize that they can go to MTGOX and bid to purchase BTC at whatever price they'd like. This is why we keep seeing post like coinbase is out of coins for 24 hours, what gives? What gives is you could go to MTGOX and buy 1000 BTC for less than $28.10/piece right now.

Someone in this thread said you need between 64k and 128k of RAM per thread. On a typical 7950 you get 24000 threads concurrently for 3 GB of RAM. Those 3 GB of RAM and the 7950 will max out somewhere around 700 MH/S.

Correction implies a decline of at least 10%. It implies a stock, bond, etc. is overvalued. 
In the case of BTC I have yet to see a claim with some numbers to back it up that it's overvalued. Lots of it's growing too fast it has to be a bubble and very little this is what $250M will allow for transactions wise. 
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:45:17

You don't need to be able to buy food and shelter with it to take off. If the market people are using them to trade in is larger than $200M they'll hold their value just fine. Party Poker (no longer the largest gambling website in the world) had revenues of more than $2B in 2011. That was after they had left the US market all together. The worldwide gambling market is $417B/year. My guess is we could expect to see at least a tiny fraction of that market converted to BTC. That tiny fraction is likely to be more than $200M.   
That's only one of the potential markets for BTC.

I don't know what happened and that's the key here. Markets, especially small ones like this, aren't perfectly efficient. 
I was under the impression SR was still down. I would be willing to bet a lot of SR vendors wanted cash for their BTC and that may have driven down the price. 
I think to say that the price of BTC is not intrinsically linked to health of SR is disingenuous at best and misinformed at worst. Vendors and customers of SR are the backbone of BTCs actual economy. The one where goods and services are exchanged.

This is a bad comparison meant to scare people into thinking BTC is a bubble. If you can prove there is an excess of BTC in response to demand I would love to hear. 
If there are currently 500,000 BTC users the max value each of us could hold in BTC would be $600. Does that seem like too much to meet the demand? 
If you bought a house in 2007 you bought into a market with ~131,000,00 units where ~20,000,000 of them sat empty. This seems an awful lot more like supply is way out pacing demand.

There's a couple of points I think we should think about:
A correction/bubble implies overvaluation. I haven't seen one argument that BTC overvalued. The market cap is $250M USD that's ~1/3 of what Fulltilt Poker (FTP) owed its players when they shutdown. My guess is that when FTP was running at full steam they had close to $1B USD in deposits. The  Poker Player Alliance estimates there are 15M Online poker players in the world. If 1% of them were going to use BTC as their currency of choice that would leave each of them with $1,667 USD worth of bitcoin, if they owned all of the BTC and there were no other uses for it. That isn't enough to bankroll a decent $1/$2 NLHE game. My guess (absolutely as modest as possible) is the market cap of BTC will have to be at least $1B USD just to service a tiny portion online gaming. 
If r/bitcoin analysts have some real number suggesting BTC is overvalued and not just "the sky is falling" I'd love to see them.

You make this seem like a trivial point. The global illegal drug market is valued at ~$321B USD/year. So the market cap of BTC is .07% of that. To put this in perspective, that room full of money they found in Zhenli Ye Gon's house (this [picture]( you always see on the internets) had roughly the market cap of BTC in it. That's one room in one druglords house. Had Zhenli YE Gon had a better way to store that money my bet is on he would have used it.
This says nothing about the legal uses (avoiding the monopolies for transferring currency, etc) for BTC.

If there are 5 new BTC gambling sites then chances are good the goods and service have/will increase tremendously. If you go to the 2+2 forums BTC poker sites are a topic of much interest. When FullTilt went belly up they owed players roughly twice what BTC's market cap is now. If we're only talking about online poker, a subset of online gambling which is a subset of the possible uses for bitcoin, BTC will have to increase in value quite a bit if it's to be a viable option.

They seem completely disinterested in customer service. This is a shame because they are the only game in town right now. They could more or less corner the US market and create customers for life.

Can you give a reason why you think it will have to come down to $10? $10 would give us a market cap of $100M how many transactions would we need to justify $100M? That seems like an awfully small number. That's 1/6 of what ONE online poker site ended up owing its depositors. If we have three moderately successful BTC only poker sites, three moderately successful online gaming sites, and one or two online sportsbooks we're gonna need a market cap of at least $1B USD. That doesn't account for SR transactions, online pharmaceutical sales, and universally legal services and supplies.

I'm hope you're being intentionally aloof. 
Why if I'm a seasoned trader would it make any more sense to put my life savings in a system (according to you) that is going to crash and burn?
My statement that it can't act as a functional transaction system was modified with "with a market cap of $2bn USD". I then went on to explain why. You can't make $315M worth of transactions with ONLY $2bn. 
I've never seen an investment with this kind of ROI but I've also never seen a currency capitalize itself. We are legitimately in uncharted waters. I am bearish on BTC for this reason but I have yet to see any real argument other than "investments can't be this good". Frankly, that isn't enough of an argument.

My guess is coinbase is at least partly responsible for those mini corrections that we're seeing.

Point 5 isn't about socialism, it's about the possibility of artificial scarcity. ASICs allow for the concentration of mining power. This concentration of mining power will lead to artificially high prices (see DeBeers). 
If that's true than point six is invalid because its predicated on points 1-5 being true and BTC actually being the only coin that we need. In fact, if there's any doubt that there are flaws in BTC it would make sense to have an altcoin or maybe even a slew of them.

You don't need to be able to buy food and shelter with it to take off. If the market people are using them to trade in is larger than $200M they'll hold their value just fine. Party Poker (no longer the largest gambling website in the world) had revenues of more than $2B in 2011. That was after they had left the US market all together. The worldwide gambling market is $417B/year. My guess is we could expect to see at least a tiny fraction of that market converted to BTC. That tiny fraction is likely to be more than $200M.   
That's only one of the potential markets for BTC.

Appeal to common sense is a logical fallacy. 
It can't function as a usable transaction system for any reasonable part of the global economy with a market cap of $2bn. If I wanted to make a $1M USD transaction today I would need .05% of the entire market cap and half of today's daily volume of GOX in order to do so.  
Can you see a system with a $2bn market cap doing $315M USD in transactions a day? Because that's what our chief rival, paypal, does. We would have to turn the ENTIRE money supply over every 7 days!! This doesn't take into account people wanting to keep savings in BTC (see my other posts in this thread about how BTC stacks up against banks in terms of depositors) and all of the uses we haven't even thought up yet.

BTC has gone through changes in the past weeks that do warrant the spike in price. BTC online casinos are beginning to catch some wind in their sails. If you remember the rise of Partypoker in 2003 you'll remember their growth was insane. In order to facilitate that kind of a rise in BTC gambling the market cap is going to have to rise substantially. I have yet to see an actual argument with numbers suggesting $250M USD is sufficient market cap for BTC to service all of the demand while some large portion of it is going to be held in speculation.

Where is this information coming from? Did you get Gallup to run some polls you're not telling us about?

Does the technology accomplish something that people want and how much use is there for it are the questions. 
Right now, if the guy who wrote bitcointipbot rolled that out as an optional add-on to people who run forums and that was the only decent use for BTC would need a market cap of more than $300M. Imagine if upvotes had a monetary value. Think about how incredibly useful that is.

I made that comment because no one was listening to me when I said the lack of buy support filling in was going to drive the market down. We need easier access to markets if we want to slow this down. People think when they buy from Coinbase or Bitinstant that they are purchasing from the market. When these sites are drastically understocked demand builds up behind them. 
I would argue that it might make sense for Coinbase to stop taking new clients until they can afford to service all of their demand or a much larger percentage than they can now. It might make sense for them to make the vetting process a little more uniform. If I log into my bank account through them, verify my phone number, and make multiple successful transactions and that doesn't auto whitelist me, WTF? I apologize for the personal tangent.
We need more markets and better education about moving your money to the markets to make direct transactions. 
My personal opinion is we never would have seen $33 yesterday if those who wanted coins had access to purchasing them.

Probably Nevada, Mississippi and Louisiana as well. States where the gaming lobby is strongest.

As long as people can buy chips to gamble with, pharmaceuticals they can't get at home for a reasonable price, and anything on the silk road they are going to continue to have value.
BWIN.Party Digital, the company behing Party Poker had revenue of nearly one billion dollars in 2011. The current market cap for all bitcoins is ~$200M. If Americans are going to use BTC as there preferred currency for gambling in the future they are going to have to be more valuable than they currently are. 
BTW I'm just expanding on your point.

Say hi when you're here!!

If people are really looking to use BTC for transactions they shouldn't care what the price is going to be. 
When I got into BTC I just bought coins because I needed them. I never thought about what the exchange rate was. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:17:14
WAIT!!! The price is going to come down significantly.

I'm pretty sure 11,000 buy orders isn't anyone cashing out.

We don't KNOW what's going to happen. That doesn't mean we're throwing darts blindfolded. In order to make rational investment decisions we have to build models with as much information as we can get. I would prefer to make investment decisions with a model that has 85% likelihood vs. one with a 15% likelihood. We're never going to have perfect information that doesn't mean we shouldn't have any information. OP offered no information.

There isn't any proof that they're pocketing the difference.

I just started a [sub]( specifically for this. All help would be appreciated.

Reading through your posts I feel like I know you. Are you friends with Holly Andres?

I can't be the only one who's never had a problem with the blockchain app.

Can you give us a sense of how many transactions you're doing a day? It would be good to have some numbers to try to figure out if people really want to use them. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 17:28:58
Now the buy section is borked all together. 
Looks like I'm off to Moneygram.

Do you know where on Blockchain.info I can get that info where it's sortable? Blockexplorer doesn't seem to be working right now.
I've been using blockchain.info but it's not really sortable from what I can tell. Is there a way to get it out of my qt-bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-02-06 20:37:01
I think they charge $2.99/transaction. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:59:04
It's only unusable until it's capitalized. Once it's moderately capitalized the price will plateau and the price swings dissipate. But it HAS to be more capitalized then it currently is to be effective.

Me and rule  are BFF after yesterday.

Blockchain.info has a list of top 100 transactions out of 50k I think.

Just change the logo to Whiffie mining BTC?
@_date: 2013-02-21 08:59:37
At some point the alternative they offer may be cheaper prices.

How is encrypting your wallet not going to help?
