I contacted Trezor support, waiting for them to answer. I’m not using the wallet for now.

It didn’t have any firmware installed, so no seeds created before me. No extra [fake seed papers]( either.

Received my Trezor today, and while I don’t think it was tampered with, I was disappointed by the box. Top and bottom sealed with very good glue and stickers, impossible to open without damaging. However, while I was trying to open the top seal, side of my package come loose…
Side was barely glued and if I knew about it beforehand I could have opened it without any damage. What’s the point of making super secure top and bottom openings when you can pry open the side without any damage? Can anyone else check their old Trezor box to see if they can open the side of the box?
Maybe I just got unlucky with the side glue, or it preforms badly when shipped at winter. 
Note that the top seal on the pic is damaged by me trying to open it, and I opened and closed the side couple of times, leaving slight marks.
Update: Trezor support answered me, and it does indeed seems like a manufacturing error. They’ll check if that could have affected other packages. As for my wallet, it is safe to use.

Yes, plastic wrap was intact and the whole box was pristine as well. Ordered directly from Trezor, so as I sad, I don’t think it has been tampered with in any way.
I’m just disappointed with the poor side glue, and was hoping to see if someone else could open a side on their old box without damaging it.

Thanks, I received the same answer from Trezor support. I just wanted to make sure that it is possible that this is a manufacturing error.

It came without firmware, as it should, so no worries there.
