Yes. I agree with you. Say the company doubles in value and decides to cash us out right before the company really takes off. Early investors really lose out on long term appreciation.

Thank you for replying. I think composed is a good idea and I agree with you that SMS might be dying. 
Do you not think it would be useful to charge/receive money for talking on the phone?

Hey...I never heard of Asterisk until now. Very interesting...so it is an open source telephone software?

So is Bran Stark Satoshi?

Maybe they want to nationalize it?

This is my first bubble and I can't take it. I've known bitcoin for the past year and a half only sinking.

I wonder if they will use crowd funding? Not that they need it, but I would like to get a chance to invest in a company Mr. Szabos is a part of. If I were a betting man, my btc would be on him being Satoshi.

Yes. That's what killed me....he couldn't stop

Vitalik can't control himself at the end. Giggling to himself like a school girl.
