Bitcorn was my team name for my work's annual cornhole tournament in September ����

They are only going to be worried about people that sold $20k+ and realized a taxable gain. This really isn't any different than a brokerage (Schwab, TDA) reporting a 1099 (summary of realized gains/losses) to the IRS.
Look I get people don't want to pay taxes but small crackdowns will increase legitimacy and further attract Wall Street investment. Adoption is the main driver of price/returns here.

Yeah that's because Bitcoin already falls under tax law. Everyone is supposed to be paying capital gains taxes no matter the dollar amount. If you aren't you are breaking the law. They are just going after the bigger fish first.

Futures open the door for ETF and Mutual Fund exposure. Easy access to the investment world where Bitcoin adoption is still very low. I wouldn't mind holding some BTC exposure via ETF in my Roth 401k, tax free growth of BTC is basically a dream come true.

Well those 4 coins make up almost 70% of the entire crypto market cap so it's probably a pretty good representation

Yeah I definitely see your point

Your holding is going up just as much as everyone else (in proportion)

I know everyone here thinks this is really important. Even if Amazon integrates BTC into the payment platform, it's not likely to be announced with quarterly earnings. It would probably be a general press release by the company.

Bought a handful of these on eBay from China. Shipping was much faster than estimated and the price is right.
