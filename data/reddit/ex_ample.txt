Unless you want your bitcoins stolen by the guys running random.org. If you only have one RNG the extra entropy you can add could always be guessed. 
Also, it clearly didn't work as it generated the same address for lots of people.

He didn't lose his money because of volatility, he lost it because MtGox fucked up. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 10:42:14
I think he's missing two key things. 
1) The government doesn't need to act covertly. 
2) Governments **can** do massive conspiracies when it comes to **technology**. (and it's not even really a conspiracy, it's just normal military contracting) 
Read up on the history of the nuclear weapons program.  The government created two entire towns where everyone worked on the program.  No one knew about the cities and the people working there didn't even know what their purpose was (other then that it was for the war effort) 
The US or Chinese government can **absolutely** run off a massive number of chips secretly.  The entire fab industry is setup for secrecy because competition between their customers is so tight.  And not only that, military hardware is a huge consumer of the semiconductor industry as it is. The US could easily order a few billion dollars in chips, secretly whenever it pleases. But it doesn't need to do so in secret. 
I have no doubt the US government could take over 50% of the network. What they could do with that is block transactions from going through, not just in their own blocks, but by refusing to build on blocks that had transactions in them they didn't like, because they had over 51% of the network, they would have that power. 
One thing they could do would be to impose heavy transaction fees and call it a "tax" 
There's a joke about "Fedcoin" but if the US government came out and said "this blockchain is backed by the US government and can be redeemed for US dollars" then in fact the vast majority of Americans would be comfortable using it - far more then are comfortable using bitcoin currently. 
I think most people involved with bitcoin lose track of the fact that their views on money aren't that widely shared.  The vast majority of people - well they may not like wallstreet - but they have confidence in the FDIC and that the money they keep in banks is secure. A crypto coin with FDIC insurance would be far more popular then bitcoin. 
Also "A government that can actually do IT". Seriously? Ask Edward Snowden if he thinks the government can do IT. Who does he think came up with the hash algorithm used in bitcoin mining? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:56:07


1) They don't "run bitcoin" 
2) You only need to trust them for a few minutes in order to put your transaction through.
3) For most people, something like coinbase is fine. A simple site where you can convert bitcoin into fiat and vise versa. The people who lost the most were likely the ones trying to daytrade it. 


They can open their source code up for inspection. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:22:43
Yes. That's true. It will be abused.
So what? Regular money is abused as well. Who cares? 
The security model is different. You're responsible for keeping your bitcoins safe, no one else. That's different from most things (except cash) and it takes some getting used too.

Obviously if Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto - he wasn't that worried about his name being associated with the project when it started. 
There is a huge difference between "overwhelming paranoia" and reasonable operational security.  The more valuable your data, the more steps you'll reasonably take to protect it. And the private keys in Satoshi's Bitcoin wallet are some of the most valuable data in the world (especially if you're counting per byte). 
But, of course, that was *not* true when the bitcoin project was first announced - it was just an academic exercise for the most part. Satoshi would have nothing to worry about when using his real name to post on forums.

I think one thing people misunderstand about Fiat currency is that the thing that they complain most about it is also a strength in some cases 
No matter what happens - you can always just print more.
So, if a warehouse full of USD goes up in smoke, the government can just print more to reimburse you. Sure, not everyone has access to the money tap, but because the supply is infinite it's always possible to buy *insurance* on things in fiat currency. 
On the other hand, if you lose bitcoin private keys, they're gone forever. You can do some insurance in BTC, but ultimately there is a fixed supply.  No one could insure 700k btc, for example, and ever have any chance of paying claims because 700k btc simply can't be had for any reason
.... unless you could drive down the price.  Which could be what MtGox is trying to do. Drive down the price so they can buy it on the cheap to cover their users. Only problem is, the price hasn't gone down on the **real** exchanges.

I figure he didn't really think bitcoin would turn into anything, or at least nothing big when he first published his paper, it was just an idea. 
He probably just started worrying about it as the value of bitcoin increased and just decided to let people think it was a pseudonym. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:04:26
Most people didn't put much of their money there in the first place.  This guy still has 120k bitcoins, that he didn't lose.  That's over $64 million dollars worth. 
Everyone with some sense would have kept their bitcoins in a secure address under their own control. 
A lot of people on this thread seem to think you need to keep bitcoin parked on some 3rd party service, like you typically do with real money (unless you want to keep stacks of paper in a safe).  But that's not how bitcoin works at all.  You keep your money on your own computer (or flash drive, or even can even print private keys on paper) 
So yeah, people who knew what they were doing may have lost a small amount with MtGox, (this guy lost something like 0.4% of his bitcoins) that they were planning on selling - and idiots might have lost more. 
And yeah, I am one of those people who think MtGox failing will be good  for bitcoin in the long run.  As this thread illustrates, there were lots of people who seemed to think Bitcoin = MtGox, and now seem to think that because MtGox failed bitcoin failed, when in fact bitcoin is perfectly fine and everyone who used it properly still has their money.

Not too dumb, too risk averse. Most people don't like to invest a lot in high-risk, high-reward assets and right now bitcoin would probably seem extremely high risk (because they don't understand that you don't need to store bitcoins at a 3rd party site, like MtGox)

It's important to keep in mind the difference between blockchain.info and the bitcoin blockchain.  Blockchain.info is a site that presents information from the blockchain on the web, and they also have a free wallet service people can use. 
blockchain.info is a useful service but you shouldn't confuse the two. What you should actually do if you want to understand how bitcoins work is download the official bitcoin client [url= and run it on your desktop computer. 
If you just want to hang on to some bitcoins, blockchain.info is fine. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:56:06
I doubt a million of them were dumb enough to leave a significant amount on MtGox. 
I don't even know why anyone would actually use the site for actually selling bitcoin for cash, since other services were much faster and required less paperwork.
People who were trying to make money daytrading lost out. Same thing would happen if it turned out that the GLD ETF had all their gold stolen. That wouldn't make gold itself worthless, just the shares in the ETF. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:10:18
If his "heart goes out" to people who lost money, why not use some of the 120k btc he has left to help make them whole? 
The reality is, *constructive* regulation from the government will actually help increase the price of bitcoin by lending it more stability. If your bitcoin investments can be insured by the FDIC with the promise of freshly printed FIAT if something happens to them, obviously more people will be willing to buy them. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:54:13
"the network" doesn't create the reward, the **the miner** creates the reward in the block they mine. "The network" is made up of miners, at least as far as adding transactions to the blockchain. 
The thing to understand is that miners (and by miners I mean solo miners or pool operators) are individually responsible for creating new coins. It's a group effort, but when a miner finds a block they are the exclusive arbiter of what goes into that block, and they - as an individual - decide where that reward goes. They could keep it, or they could send it directly to another address or even destroy it if they wanted too.
People who do pooled mining are in turn rewarded by pool operators. 
The only way other miners help them is by choosing their block as the next one and building on it, so that it gets confirmations and doesn't become an orphan block. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:03:06
The current blockchain doesn't support debts but it could theoretically be implemented. You could just say a certain address "owes" another address money, and then whenever that address is paid, it's automatically sent to the lender. 
The problem, obviously, is that everyone can create new addresses whenever they want.

One of the biggest problems bitcoin has had has been it's annoying community. Most people are turned off by hard-core libertarianism and ranting about the immorality monetary system. The existing banking system works fine for them - and they don't see a need to change it (Well, in the sense of depositing money and buying stuff) 
On the other hand, people like memes. Dogecoin presents a friendly face to crypto currencies and can get people who aren't fans of libertarianism or Austrian economics to use them.

The protocol is fine, MtGox's implementation was exceptionally stupid. 
There's no way to assess the implementations of the other exchanges without seeing their source code. But avoiding the problems that MtGox had shouldn't be particularly difficult. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:45:26


Yes, that would obviously be bad. Thankfully, bitcoin doesn't work that way. Power isn't transferred to anyone, rather it's transferred to a software protocol written in 2009, and run on everyone's computers. 
If you, or anyone else tries to change the way it works, your software won't sync up with everyone else's.
No one has the power change the software running on everyone's computers, so no one "controls" bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-03-09 05:32:18

@_date: 2014-03-09 12:56:10
Sure, but what's going to prevent people from using the new government fork?  Existing miners, with all the ASICs would have an incentive to stay on the new fork and simply follow the government's rules about who can and can't use bitcoin. 
Any businesses and companies in the US that want to convert bitcoin to cash would want to use the new (legal) fork. 
Essentially the government would have taken over bitcoin and people who didn't like it would just be using an altcoin. The US government putting it's stamp of approval on a blockchain would actually vastly increase the value because most people are going to use something that's government endorsed and regulated over something that isn't.

Yup, that's right. This is what happens when you take away government control of the money supply. If you leave your BTC in the hands of other people, they can take it from you. 
On the other hand, you don't have to do that.  You can store the private keys to your bitcoin wallet yourself, in which case no one can take it. 
You understand that the OP only lost 0.44% of his bitcoins, and still has $64 million dollars worth right?

@_date: 2014-02-25 23:30:12
Fuck man. 
There is a lot of way overly complicated advice on cold storage.  Unless you're completely broke, the obvious way to do it is
1) Buy a laptop
2) Install bitcoin on that laptop, and nothing else. 
3) Keep your bitcoins on that machine and keep it disconnected from the internet when you're not using it. Don't even *open* the web browser on that machine. (and it should be running Linux, not windows)  
If you had 300 bitcoins, you can sell one and buy the necessary machine. 
Additionally you should keep the hard drive encrypted but you do then run the risk of forgetting the password. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 12:52:09
Nope, they can block transactions permanently, because they can refuse to include blocks mined elsewhere in the blockchain if they include transactions they don't like. The other blocks would be orphaned.

Bitcoin is pretty big at this point, used by more then just the core constituency - if the government creates their own fork, they'll bring everyone along (and actually, everyone with current bitcoins will still have them on the old fork as well, so they'll be able to spend them there as well) 
I just think the value will go way down.

This kind of statement is annoying.  The bitcoin system isn't run by anyone.  It's autonomous. I think a lot of people don't understand what that means exactly - the people who keep the system running are the people running bitcoin clients and/or mining, with everyone using mutually compatible software. 
In order for changes to occur, essentially every single user needs to agree to them. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:32:03
Being played? People like bitcoin, and they continue to like bitcoin. The fact that MtGox failed isn't due to a failure in bitcoin, it's due to a failure in MtGox. 
It was obvious that MtGox was run by idiots and their demise was long overdue. Bitcoin can still be sold for over $500 on other sites. The failure of MtGox illustrates how bitcoin is independent from it.  Yeah, the price went down - oh well. For people who bought at $5 or $50 it hardly matters. 
People who used bitcoin properly and didn't trust their BTC in the hands of third parties haven't lost anything. 
Bitcoin still serves it's original purpose - to transfer units of value securely over the internet - just fine.

Yeah, some people like buying illegal stuff. 
Crypto currencies are also useful because they can be traded without arbiters or intermediaries. That, of course makes them easy to steal, as OP found out.  On the other hand, OP still has $64 million dollars worth of btc so I doubt he's too upset about the whole thing. 
At the end of the day, even with scams and the occasional losses, people who got into bitcoin really have become incredibly wealthy because of it.  It's obvious they're going to have a favorable view about something that made them rich. Why wouldn't they?

I think part of the problem was that n00bs didn't know the history of MtGox and how they were hacked in the past and precipitated a major bitcoin crash (from $37 down to $2)
The real problem is that people kept using it after that.
If you want to day-trade bitcoin I'd wait for one of these bitcoin ETFs to come out.  You won't actually "have" bitcoin, but if you have your bitcoin on an exchange or a 3rd party site you don't technically "have" it either.

It's actually an inverse relationship. The fewer people trading, the higher the price. If people take their btc offline using paper wallets or cold storage, the price of bitcoin will go **up** because the supply will be smaller.  
On the other hand, if they get out of the market by simply selling all their btc and giving up, the price will obviously go **down**
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:41:59


I don't think that's true.  If gox did 100k volume a day and took a 0.5% fee they would be making 500 btc a day. 1,400 days, or less then 4 years to make 700k btc.

**Realistically**, what have they got to lose? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 07:28:21
Actually, it sounds like you don't understand how bitcoin works - probably because you're doing pooled mining.  When you do pooled mining, the pool rewards itself, and divides the 25 bitcoins among the users who submitted shares.

Lol, because if there's anything the hedgefund industry isn't it's "a way for manipulative people to get rich" right?
Yeah MtGox failed.  MtGox sucked. The OP probably still has more money in the bank despite your two decades in the hedge fund industry (Unless you have more then $64 million).  He lost some pocket change.
MtGox wasn't bitcoin, and frankly MtGox was a drag on bitcoin. It was a service built on top of bitcoin and it sucked - this isn't even the first time MtGox has had a security problem that made it seem like bitcoin itself was less secure then it actually is, and confused people into thinking bitcoin itself had failed or been hacked. I'm glad they're gone.
Anyone who left significant amounts of BTC on MtGox was an idiot and deserved to lose their money.  (and for this guy, as I said, has tens of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin and in fact didn't lose a "significant" amount compared to his net worth) 
I'm not particularly concerned about the reduced price at the moment either.  Who cares. Unlike greedy wallstreet wankers who can never get enough, there's a threshold at which I stop caring about money, and I'm well past that. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:22:10
Or keeping their bitcoins safe in wallets they control.  The OP still has $64 million dollars worth of bitcoin he can sell whenever he wants. And bitcoin is still worth over $500 
For the people who left a significant amount of money on MtGox, it sucks.  For people who didn't, it's a speed bump. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:57:26
What are you talking about? Bitcoin is already big. I thought it would hover around $100 for years, the way it sat around $5 for a long time and steadily rose to $10-15.  I thought it might hit $1k in 10 years or something.
I have no idea what the price of bitcoin will be in the future. Yeah, it would be nice if it went back up to $1k, but it's hardly going to affect me if it drops to $400 and stays there for years.

What are you talking about? Regulation can't make money appear out of thin air if it's stolen.  There is some protection for consumer accounts, but business accounts don't get the same protections. 
The US government has prosecuted people for stealing bitcoin in the past. There's no reason to think they couldn't be prosecuted here if they were based in the US. 
On the other hand, just look at wallstreet.  Look at what happened in 2008 onward.  Only a handful of bankers have gone to jail and they stole billions of dollars. Instead of jail time they pay fines that are less then the profits they made on their scams, if that.

The bug wasn't actually that serious in bitcoin itself - it's just that there was an additional "bug" in MtGox's internal software that caused to "lose" a shit-ton of money. More likely, it was stolen by an insider.

The only reason it seems "mind boggling" is because it's obviously not true. Supposedly they had some flaw that let people withdraw the same money over and over using different TXids for the same TX, but in reality an insider probably just stole all the money. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:49
It might seem like that if you're a moron.  There is no "small group of unnamed people" in control of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a P2P system where everyone's transactions are mirrored on every users's computer. Since they all run the same code, they all get the same data.  All the computers are kept in sync. 
No one has the ability to make changes to how it works.  It runs autonomously. While it's true that if bitcoin miners wanted to they could band together and block certain transactions - that's all they can do. They can't create transactions from addresses they don't have the private keys too. 
That's what a lot of people don't seem to understand - no one "controls"  bitcoin.

The bitcoin protocol wasn't designed to make people rich, it wasn't designed to be easily exchanged for currency either.  It was really just designed as an experiment and a way for cypherpunks and hackers to send small amounts of money.  
I doubt Satoshi ever would have thought it would be worth anything like this much this quick. 
Anyway the point is you can't "blame bitcoin" because MtGox failed when bitcoin/dollar exchange was never a part of the original design.  It's something that can be done, but only if you trust the exchange.

At a certain point, bitcoin isn't going to make people rich, because it will have already reached a peak price, or at least a peak short-term price, and either stabilize or decline. Bitcoin has gone up in price over 100x since I got into it. I don't expect that to continue.

People only do that because it's profitable. They buy the store, pay it's employees, maintenance, upkeep - and yes after a while you make profits year on year. It's not "infinite" because the earth will only exist for a finite amount of time. You can go out of business due to local economic trends (i.e people leave the area) before you profit off your initial expense. 
But that said, there is far, far less work done in managing credit cards then there is in putting food on store shelves.  Credit cards are just numbers in databases. You mail out 5¢ bits of plastic once every two years, and you maintain a database with a few hundred million entries. Far less effort then maintaining the blockchain, for example. 
Furthermore, all those ATMs and point of sale card readers?  It's the same supermarket that actually pays for those, they charge a 3% "swipe fee" - They purchase the physical ATM as well and the owner of the ATM takes the fee you pay when you use it. It's not interest rates that pay for those things.

First of all, Mt. Gox is based in Japan, but they do comply with US law.

@_date: 2012-01-15 01:51:24
MtGOX really needs to address this. 
One thing I think every bitcoin site should have is an 'exit address' or 'emergency withdrawal address'.  When you create an account with a site, you should be able to enter an address that, should anything go wrong, your coins will be sent too.   Deepbit, for example has an option that will let you 'lock your payments address **forever**' meaning, even if someone hijacks your account, they won't be able to withdraw money anywhere. 
Right now, it's a huge problem for any site dealing with valuable data: how do you know if someone claiming they lost the account is the real person?  They could be anyone, right? 
But, with an exit address -- this problem can basically be solved. So you forget your password, your email, whatever, or any other reason why an account must be closed (i.e. they don't want your business) you should be able to request that the money be sent to your exit address. 
You could even have an option that if you don't log-on in x months, the money will be sent automatically.  That way you won't lose your coins even if you forget your account name (won't work if you lose your wallet, unfortunately) 
For All Gox knows, you're just some hacker who stole someone's credentials and is trying to log on with TOR to steal them. They absolutely should have checked to see if you were using TOR when you signed up, or give people the option to allow TOR logons (if their accounts are verified, I guess)

It might seem like somewhat of a security risk, but it's not really. You're the one requesting the data yourself, so you wouldn't do it if you didn't trust the server that's sending data. 
Beyond that, if you want too, you can just ignore that parameter an manually parse the data out of JSON instead or using eval().

Ideally what you want to do is set a price in BTC.  So if something is worth $100, and the current price of BTC is $10, you make a deal to buy it for ฿10, then buy the coins and send them before the price goes up.
Of course, if the price is dropping rapidly, sellers might change their prices quickly to keep up. 
Even more ideally, people keep some amount of money in BTC in their wallets at all time, so that they don't need to worry as much about the current price flux.

You need real, raw IP internet access to access the block chain directly.  But one person with a solid internet connection could operate as a 'bank' for other people.
Or, you could send BTC from the u.s. to someone in another country, like the Netherlands, or Kenya, or wherever who is capable of sending cash directly to Somalia.

You could use bitcoin to purchase those other physical currencies as well. 
I would say 50% leave in the bank (In case nothing goes wrong)  15% USD notes, 15% Euro notes 10% gold/silver and 10% BTC.

Let me try to give a simpler explanation from a purely mathematical point of view. 
Lets say you have a number X.  and you have a hashing function f(). You want to find a number X2 such that f(X,X2) &lt; D where D is a 'difficulty' factor. 
Once you have an X2, you can then try to find an X3 such that f(X2, X3) &lt; D. 
Eventually you'll have a huge list of numbers X1, X2, X3 ... Xn.  If someone wanted to verify that you really did all the work and hashed all those numbers, they would be able too. It would be impossible for someone to come up with a 'fake' Xn that didn't include data from all the previous ones (at least impossible with normal computers before the end of time) 
Let's call that list of numbers a 'blockchain'.   And instead of just doing f(X2, X3) we do f(X2, X3, [list of transactions]).  Where the [list of transactions] is just a list of who sent money where. 
In that case, people could manually go back and verify not only the list of numbers, but also all the transactions.   Also keep in mind that the list of transactions includes cryptographic signatures of people who made them, so you can't steal coins from people if you're a miner. 
Bitcoin mining works by people trying to guess numbers that are less then D when put into that hashing function.  But each time they try to guess a number, they have to verify everything else is correct as well.  It is possible to 'fake out' the network and make invalid blocks if you have more then 51% of the hashing power.  But it would still show up as being invalid and could be corrected by manually validating the block chain.

Now that it has people are coming back on board, *but* it's likely that at this point lots of people are looking at the run up and wanting to get a piece before it crashes. 
It would be nice if it was possible to tell where the price would end up. It hit 13 yesterday and now it's already at 14.5!? 
I obviously want bitcoins to go up in value, but this kind of volatility might hurt the 'economy'.  
Long term: having a stable price point helps the currency. 
I'd... just like that price point to be $1,000 or so :P

If you'd gotten in early you could do whatever you wanted with your bitcoins. But you'd probably be hording them like most people :P
If people are motivated by altruism, they could donate to starving orphans, or homeless or whatever.  Or if they care about the net they could donate to mozilla, firefox, the EFF, wikileaks, TOR and so on. 
No one wants to donate money to help someone else get rich. Of course people are motivated by self-interest when it comes to bitcoin.

Lol. Come on the bitcoin economy is rife with cons and hacks. People need to realize they need to be careful with their BTC since there's no recourse. 
If BFL is legit, why don't they take credit cards? That way, you could do a chargeback if you never get your product.
Anyway, it's entirely possible that it's legit. But, there's always the possibility of fraud.

Ugh.  I really don't think Bitcoin advocates do themselves any good saying stuff like "The problem with the nation state, is that everyone gets the sense that it's time is done".  That kind of thing just sounds crazy to most people.  Even if it were true, it isn't true that **everyone** thinks that. 
It also gives the false impression that somehow the success of bitcoin is predicated on the failure of fiat currencies.  In reality, both can exist side by side just fine. 
@_date: 2012-08-17 07:22:17
Security breaches did trigger the previous sell-off. 
But I think for sure it's going to overshoot it's 'true' value, if people see the price rising rapidly, they are going to want to buy buy buy. Once it starts to level off they are going to want to be the first to take their profits. 
I think what you're going to see is peaks and troughs in the price with a ceiling and floor.

Not really.   Most likely, it's done to protect them from fraud.  The "real money" system is absolutely rife with fraud, apparently. Look at how TradeHill had to drop Dwolla because they had to yank back some money. 
I've never had to verify my MtGox account, I've never given them anything besides an email address.  But I've never put in USD.  Instead, I deposited coins I mined myself. 
I've taken small withdrawals, no problem.  I'm actually somewhat nervous about it though with all the trouble people have been having.   I haven't deposited any more BTC and I'm just leaving it on my bitcoin machine. 
I'm worried if I take a 'large' withdrawal, it might trigger some scrutiny, but, I think it's pretty unlikely that any amount of bitcoin I could withdrawal could be considered 'large' by Gox standards :P

Just create a bunch of encrypted volumes, and forget the keys to them.   The government will have no way of knowing which ones you know the keys too and which you don't.

Didn't private banks actually issue currency back in the day?
Anyway, we do have private banks issuing "currency", their credit and debit cards, as well as things like paypal.  They're all denominated in USD, but the cards are their own currency. 
And they want to move to a "cashless society" so they can take a slice of every single transaction.  A privatized VAT that goes to line the pockets of bankers, whereas at least if you were paying the government at least *some* of it would go toward helping people.
That's the real promise of bitcoin.  Freedom from the government is great (if you want to buy drugs or donate to wikileaks), but freedom from the **banks** is even better.

Well, I certainly wouldn't invest in new hardware *now* with ASICs and the halving around the corner. 
However, if you're **not paying for electricity...** it's certainly profitable at the moment :)  Obviously, there are limits to how much power you can get for free. 
That said, if these ASICs actually work, the cheapest should be around $250 or so, about the price of a GPU. It's certainly something people can do   The might not make much, but they'll probably make enough to cover the cost of hardware, perhaps a couple of times over in a few years.

Sure, but they don't always buy it just because they want it.  I know personally, I was looking to replace my cellphone with a model that just came out.  I had the cash, but decided to wait and see if anything better came out. 
A year later, I was able to get that exact same phone for $95 used, with no contract. 
People absolutely do put off computer purchases until they **need** a new one.   The flip side, of course, is that computers do go obsolete. Obviously people would buy fewer computers if they weren't constantly getting better.  The phone I got for $95 is already kind of out of date :P 
@_date: 2012-09-24 21:01:31
Well, here's the thing
You can get a single computer with a GPU and mine, but you won't make money very quickly. Maybe like 1-2 BTC a week? Eventually the card will pay for itself, but that's not counting electricity. 
Or, you can build a data center, and if you can get cheap or free electricity, you can make a lot of money, but that does require up front investment. 
The ASICs do the same thing as GPUs.  But they use far, far less electricity per amount of hashing. So you can buy one and use it in your house without using tons of electricity or generating tons of heat. 
But, once they're on they saturate the market, they won't make much money for people because the difficulty should go way up.  It's a gamble as far as whether or not they'll make much money.

Krugman is a Nobel laureate as well. He obviously doesn't haven a problem with the government issuing currency and/or printing tons of it when it needs too. 
Here's the thing though.  These days companies aren't printing pieces of paper, they're issuing plastic. And they take a fee every time you use it. 
So with no independent means of exchange, banks are able to take a transaction fee out of every exchange.  Basically, a private sales tax that does nothing for anyone. 
Bitcoin is an alternative to that, but it's also filling a role that the government should have done: creating an electronic alternative to the USD.  But instead of doing that, they take massive bribes from the banks, then let those banks take their own chunk of the transaction - basically a privatized sales tax (which is payed by the merchant, since the prices are the same if you pay in cash - but obviously they have to raise prices for everyone to cover it) 
@_date: 2012-09-04 16:11:24


Sure, or they could work in their spare time for two months and get the same amount of work done, **then** try to make money off of what they've done. 
The reason (idiots) try to "invest" in ponzi schemes is that, if they don't know it's a scam, will try to invest in them is that they have regular returns that pay back right away.  If you invest in something speculative, then it could take months/years to get your money back and the project may be a dud or the programmer might not know what they're doing. 
Remember [Diaspora](  They raised $150k off kickstarter to make an open source Facebook clone.  Then it turned out they had no idea what they were doing.  Their first release was buggy and had like zero security.
Furthermore, cranking out a bitcoin app isn't like writing some cheezy website.  The security has to be rock solid or you're going to get hacked.
So, realistically it would be silly to donate a ton of BTC to some "sci-fi" project when you have no idea if the programmer is any good.

Alternate currencies aren't illegal, you just can't claim that they are legal tender.

That has nothing to do with whether or not Satoshi was making a comment about fractional reserve banking, or any other aspect of banking, other then the fact that bailouts were happening. But the bailouts had nothing to do with the fractional cash reserve, but rather bad mortgage derivatives (and in europe, government bonds)
The problem here is that you're assuming your problem with the banking system is the same as everyone else's, thus if someone complains about banking they are complaning about 'fractional reserve'.  But there are number of other problems, such as 'too big to fail' and 'prop trading' and 'over leveraging'.  And those relate to non-monitary assets like derivatives, bonds, etc.  Not cash.

Well, that's debatable. The problem is, you just don't know someone's intention.  Do they intend actually do what they say, or are they just scamming people?   Whether or not you agree, the government has decided that people are too easy to scam and put in some protections to prevent that from happening.

That's how deflation works: things cost less money. 


Right... but if bitcoins were dropping in value, it would be even more of an incentive to spend, because if you could get something 1 bitcoin today, it would cost 2 bitcoins tomorrow. 
It might seem like an incentive to spend, but if you wait another day, and then another the price might go up even more. 
But the problem for now is, the price could drop back to $5 and stay there for a year, so even though the price is going up, we don't have deflationary expectations yet.  If the price continues to rise for months on end like it did in '09-early '10, people might start hoarding more.

If Iranians all started buying bitcoin, that would definitely boost the price.  But the problem is, how would they buy it? No one wants Iranian rials.
You'd need to find someone in Iran who can collect rials, convert them into USD somehow, send you the dollars in exchange for bitcoins.

Because if they were really only $80 million for a nuke, it would cost far, far less then what Iran is spending. In 2007, the US built a centrifuge plant that cost about [$2 billion dollars]( with 11k machines. 
Iran has over 8,000 centrifuges, and they almost certainly have to pay a higher price since with all the sanctions.  Their plants need to be underground to resist bombing. If they could buy bombs from, say, North Korea for $80 million, it would be far cheaper.

No, it's a bad thing that this 'can' be done. After all, what's to stop the government from doing the same thing with bitcoin?

It would cost them $80m and give them 66Thashes/sec, 10x the current bitcoin network hashrate. 
Of course, one nice thing about bitcoin is that if it stays small, it wouldn't be a threat.  If it gets huge, the hash-rate will go up. But still, the government has practically unlimited resources.   They can easily fab their own Asic miners to fuck with the process, etc.

If you could get your hands on an ASIC rig **just** a couple weeks before the floodgates open you could make back your initial investment in those initial few weeks.  
**especially** if you get your rig in the intervening two weeks before the difficulty rate spikes.  Remember, since it adjusts every two weeks, if the hash-rate goes up by an order of magnitude during those two weeks you could see massive, massive spikes. 
The huge gamble, though, is that you place your order, then wait two months for delivery, and the difficulty has already gone up by a huge amount, making an investment that would have paid off immediately take forever to do so. 
Anyway, this is why competition is good. With multiple ASIC providers, you're likely to drive the price down, and fuel innovation.

That's delusional.  If you're in the middle of the desert, with hardly any water, no arable land, no livestock, etc what exactly are you going to do to become non-poor. 
People who live in hunter gatherer societies are doing OK, but they definitely stay poor.  But that only works if there are natural resources to hunt and gather, and land to do it on.  If the land is already all owned, then there is really nothing to do.
Some people might get rich, the rest of them will just end up dead. 
If you look at, for example, the UK in the 1700s-1800s, what actually happened was you had downward social mobility.  A rich landowner would have lots of kids, some of them would inherit a lot, and someone would end up in a lower social rung.  After a couple generations you would have poor people who's great grandparents had been rich.   Eventually, they'd just end up dead, with no offspring. 
With no money, and no support structure, and no free resources to take (like with hunters and gatherers) the reality is most people will just end up dead.

@_date: 2012-09-29 23:26:18
No. They are not.  The companies that were bailed out were not part of the fractional reserve system.  They were investment banks that didn't need to hold any capital at all, because they didn't hold capital, they held stocks/bonds/investments. **they were not savings banks subject to fed capital requirements** 
The problem here is that you have no understanding of how the system works. And you're assuming, with no evidence that Satoshi shares your view. 
Oh well whatever, you're like a toddler who doesn't understand that other people view the world differently.  You have no evidence that Satoshi agrees with you, but you're assuming he does... for no reason at all. 
And by the way, you do understand that fractional reserve banking was started by private individuals, right?  Goldsmiths would lend out more gold then they held for other people in their vaults.  And without regulations, the banks could keep less in their vaults, not more.  Any website that stores bitcoins for other people, MtGox, btc-e, any other exchange can do fractional reserve banking if they want too.  Obviously, if you keep bitcoins on your own machine, you don't have to worry about fractional reserve.  But you can keep all your cash in bills in a safety deposit box as well, if you want. 
Fractional reserve banking has nothing to do with the government, the government allows it. But it happened before government regulation and it can still happen without it.

Those are the problems bitcoins is *supposed to fix*, by making it possible to send btc anywhere in the world to anyone at any time.  But, the problem here is that there isn't any other currency that can be used online the same way. 
The reason these sites have strict verification rules is that they are trying to follow laws designed to prevent money laundering.   Bitcoin, obviously, is perfect for money laundering, and these sites want to make sure that *they* are not liable. 
You could maybe find some [local dealers]( who will sell you coins for cash in person.

It's not, it's good for sellers. Right now, selling stuff on the internet is risky, because customers have too much power in the deal. 
Bitcoin is really best for web-based transactions where there's a low risk of fraud.  Imagine buying Mp3s directly from artists using bitcoin.  There's no middle man, the artist gets all the money.   
There's no benefit in not delivering the MP3. 
And not only that, for digital goods you could use encryption and bitcoin contracts such that you encrypt a digital file with a customer key, and in order to decrypt they have to sign a transaction on the block-chain proving they got the exact file they ordered. 
Bitcoin contracts could, in theory be used for customer protection in the future.  You could have a digital escrow service that signs a transaction as being valid, and if they don't do that the bitcoins would revert to the origional owner. 
There's also no risk that the escrow service will run off with the money, either.  But that doesn't exist yet.

I would actually recommend going the localcoin rout, actually. For a couple of reasons: 1) Anonymity. 2) Convience, 3) I think it would be a good thing to encourage people to get into the business of buying and selling BTC in person.   Of course, you'll probably need to live near a big city to make it worth while, but given the hassle you might not end up wasting that much extra time. 
Of course, if you have to pay higher prices, might not be worth it.

This kind of either-or thinking is annoying.  It's entirely possible that bitcoin will remain relatively small and off the radar of state regulators as anything other then a curiosity.
Yes, if bitcoin ever got to be so huge that it was putting a significant dent in tax revenue, then I suspect something might happen.  
Right now the total value of all bit coins is about $100 million.  The "M2" money supply is about 10 trillion dollars. So the total value of all USD is around 100,000 times as much as bitcoin. Why would anyone in government care at this point? 
Money laundering is a more serious issue. If major drug dealers start using it, that could result the government trying to clamp down on that aspect. But that's separate from the issue of taxes, competition with fiat currency, etc.

The way MtGox works, you submit a 'buy' order at whatever price you want. If someone submits a 'sell' order at or below that price, you get them, and they get your USD. 
So you might set a buy order at $10 today, if the price drops below that, someone will eventually issue a sell order at that price and you'll pick them up.
There is no way to really predict the price, in the short term. But the more popular it gets, the more valuable it should get. 
If you just want to get some in order to buy something on, you don't really need to worry too much about the long term price.  Buy however many you need at that point in time, and then spend them right away. 
Hopefully the price will stabilize somewhat.  It was around $5 for a long time, and that makes it easier for people to price things.  If the price fluctuates wildly, it makes things unstable. 
(btw, you probably shouldn't transfer directly from MtGox to silkroad - I actually don't know how that site even works, but MtGox will know who you are, and if the government ever started caring, the government could correlate your btc address with your name)

The point of bitcoin is that you can send money without going through PayPal, or the banks, or whatever.  You don't *need* to give your name or any other identifying information.  Now, if you're not careful it might be possible to figure out who you are, but that's different from the regular banking system where you need to be identified at all times.

Really, the paranoia about "fractional reserve banking" is kind of embarassing.  The credit default swaps that first triggered the financial crisis had nothing to do with fractional reserve banking at all. Most of the banks that were caught up in it were investment banks that didn't have normal 'savings' accounts and thus didn't do fractional reserve banking, or even hold money in the form of dollars, at all. 
Interestingly, many switched to be bank-holding companies so they could get bailouts from the fed post-crash.  But that still would have happened if the haddn't been doing fractional reserve. It was totally irrelevant.

Wow that's crazy. They also have [this article]( about Slovenia. 
Anyway, this is all exactly what Krugman has been talking about how bad the Euro is and the refusal of the ECB to inflate. 
Here's the problem, based on reading Krugman's blog: These countries, Italy, Greece, Portugal, they all have huge debts and need to borrow in Euros to pay for them. On the other hand, the U.S, Japan and UK also have huge debts, but can borrow from their own central banks (essentially, printing money) to pay.   Japan's debt is like 200% GDP. 
That means that the U.S, U.K and Japan have low interest rates (look it up, it's very low for all of them, while it's difficult for the PIIGS to borrow money because people think they might default, and the interest rates go up more.  Which makes them more likely to default and you end up with runaway interest rates through a feedback effect. 
So what the ECB wants is for these countries to 1) institute harsh 'austerity' measures like massive high taxes and cuts to spending and 2) 'internal deflation' rather then monetary inflation: so wages and the cost of items should go down.  The problem is that while it's easy to raise wages and prices, it's really difficult to cut them.  
It's easy to give someone a raise, but it cutting people's salaries almost never happens, you need to wait for people to leave. The result is that it takes forever and the economy gets trashed.
And finally, all these measures: Austerity + induced deflation make people hate their government. From they're view they'll think they are sacrificing to save the balance sheets of German banks.  And they'll be correct. And hate the Euro, which could mean that the whole eurozone gets destroyed through the democratic process.
So yeah you guys should pay more attention to Krugman.   BTW: Krugman said bitcoin was a 'good investment' but not a good currency.  People into bitcoin should be happy that he thought it was a good investment. 
Bitcoin might might work if prices are pegged to another currency.  As long as I can pay for something worth $5 with $5 worth of bitcoins at the moment (whether that's 1 or 0.1) then I'll be much more likely to to spend bitcoins, since I can just buy more immediately to protect my 'investment' 
@_date: 2012-01-11 00:44:05
It's probably more like price increase/price decrease.  
I was thinking of buying some stuff when btc hit $2.50, since it would mean I was paying low prices.  Now that they're $6 and rising quickly... I wouldn't want to do that.  If prices were stable for a long time, I'd be more likely to buy or sell. 
But I think it will be a long time before that happens. 
@_date: 2012-08-26 05:32:09
Other then the price flux, it's actually much, much safer to keep the money as btc then as USD.  Bitcoins can't be confiscated, they can't be taxed, etc. 
As long as he withdraws less then, say $10k/mo he'll probably never raise the ire of the IRS or anything like that
If he tries to take out $5m at once, it would raise all kinds of red flags, both at the exchanges, and at the banks he would be depositing the money into, and with the IRS.  It would be moronic. 
Plus, he has just as much reason to hold bitcoins as anyone else. 
Finally, he probably doesn't actually have that many

Maybe that was true 20 years ago, but how old are you now? lots of the people in power grew up with computers as much as you did. 
Let's say you're in the government and you find out about bitcoin. The pluses of bitcoin for users are actually negatives from the perspective of the government, and the banks (which pay for politicians campaigns, remember) 
Yeah, the government could go after criminals, but it's *easier* to go after criminals if they have to use banks for all their business (unless the banks are in on it, like Wachovia had been -- they'd been laundering money for the Mexican cartels, hundreds of billions) 
Similarly a totally non-anonymous currency makes tax collection easier.

It would be much, much better if the central location for the discussion and development of bitcoin weren't also a hive of what people think of as crazy. 
The original idea spread bitcoin through libertarian as well as geek sphere was a good one, but I think it's gotten a little out of control and hampered bitcoin acceptance.

It's like a bank that only makes loans to mining companies.  If the mining companies go bust, then the bank goes bust. 
But with real mining, the 'difficulty' can go up overall in an unpredictable way, but the ROI on each mine is easily modelable.  But with bitcoin, it's not.

I think the question we have to ask is how long are people going to hold onto their bitcoin? If it's a few months then yeah the market can support these high prices. But, if it's just a few days to buy something, then it can support the same volume of transactions at a much lower price. 
So for example, if there are 3 million dollars worth of transactions a day, and 6 million 'active' bit-coins then the price would only need to be about 50 cents, not 50 dollars.

I don't think it's actually possible to **encrypt** things with a biometric in a reliable way. 
In order to use a cryptographic system you have to get the password perfectly correct. One missed character, and it doesn't work. 
With a biometric, however a computer program is looking at your face/voice/fingerprint and trying to gauge how 'similar' the image our audio sample is to how you normally look/sound. If it's 'similar enough' it will let you in. 
So basically there is no way to use current crypto tech to encrypt from a biometric.  The best you can do is use a biometric access system to store your passwords. But if you do that on an iPhone a hacker could **theoretically** just dump the contents of the hard drive and figure out your wallet key. 
Also, since it sounds like bitcoin apps are not getting approved for the App Store, you really should switch to android. There are lots of wallet apps for android already available. And you're not giving apple control over your life (most phones allow you to run apps you load yourself, even if they're not in the android market)

It depends on how much people hold, as opposed to converting into other currencies. It will be interesting to see what happens after the first price crash.  If people abandon it, it could become worthless. 
If the price is unstable, people might not want to keep much value in there. They'll buy bitcoin quickly, then make purchases quickly.  On the other hand while bitc is still skyrocketing, people will only spend a small fraction of what they have. 
It all depends on how much people want to hold in reserve.

Well, there were a shitload of scams on wallstreet leading up to 2008. Everything from shady stuff like AAA rated subprime mortgage bundles up to straight up frauds like Madoff.  
But part of the reason wallstreet 'works' is the SEC, the fact that corporations can be sued and people can even go to jail (like Madoff) but with GLBSE there is no SEC, there are no regulations that require disclosure. Maybe the SEC didn't work the way it was supposed too, but there is still a lot of confidence in the market because expects are, for the most part afraid of breaking the SECs rules.  No one is going to lie on a quarterly report or whatever, because they are afraid of going to jail.
And while CEOs of major corporations in theory control the resources of their companies, they can't just run off with the money.  They would go to jail **for sure** 
With GLBSE, there's nothing stopping CEOs from running off with the cash if they feel like it.  GLBSE can delist them, but they can't have them thrown in jail or whatever.

I said there are no banks doing fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. I didn't say it wasn't possible.  But it's pretty clear from your comment that you don't know what fractional reserve banking actually is.  
You keep using the word 'fractional' by itself.  But it's totally meaningless to call a currency 'fractional'. (other then that you can break bitcoin into small pieces, like 0.001 btc).  Because of that, your comment doesn't actually make any sense. You have to use the same words to mean the same things as other people do if you want to have a discussion.

That's not true at all.  I have some "super machines" and I also put a high end GPU in my desktop machine.  I mine with both. The amount of money you make scales linearly with how many GPUs  you have. 
So actually if you already have a computer sitting around, and just want to put a high-end GPU in it and start mining, the cost is actually **lower** then building a full scale mining rig, since you don't have the 'extra' costs (PSU, Mobo, etc)

It's not just paper.  The government guarantees that you can use it to pay any legally enforceable debts, and the government requires you pay taxes with it. So, if you have to pay taxes, then you have to acquire paper (or electronic stand-ins for paper). That means there will always be a market for it.

Banks get hacked all the time.  It's the thread of prosecution if caught that prevents (to a certain extent) the ability of hackers to use the money they might get. 
What I wonder if whether or not bitcoin users are who are getting hacked are working with the government to try to investigate the hacks.  The money involved is, for the most part, enough to pass the FBI threshold.  Why not contact them? Have they done that?
Bitcoins are not really that anonymous.  At a certain point you have to convert them into real money or make yourself known in some way.  Even if you transfer the currency over and over again, the keys will still be in the coins, and you can get pinned. Using bitcoin for anything illegal is incredibly stupid.

You can program a bot however you want.  If you think bitcoins have an 'intrinsic' value of $14, then you could program a bot to sell any time it's over $14 and buy any time it's less then $14

Ugh, what crap. Bitcoin has never been hacked, obvious.  Only services that sprung up around bitcoin, by people who didn't know what they're doing. 
Still, those hacks definitely played a roll in bitcoin losing 'credibility' this summer. It's too bad. Bitcoin worked, but the ecosystem around it just wasn't mature enough to handle the limelight.

I think one problem is that it's riskier for consumers. A bitcoin based ebay would be problematic because of the lack of trust.  Not that ebay isn't hell for legit sellers who get scammed by customers in the first place.

If it wasn't for the fact that people being this dumb were bad for bitcoin I would laugh.  There's no fundamental problem with *bitcoin itself*, the problem is all the services that cropped up around bitcoin when it was mostly just a hobby. Now those same services aren't up to handling transactions with real financial worth. 
It's mind boggling that someone would just trust a random, anonymous site to store *all* your bitcoins.  Just madness. Storing them on a desktop computer, provided you feel safe you won't get hacked is fine. If you're not sure, you can put them on a separate machine, keep it unplugged from the tubes and there you go. 
What's interesting to me is how bitcoin makes everyone realize how lax security is for most people.  We don't expect to get hacked, so people don't even worry about it. With bitcoin, suddenly you have digital files with real value on ordinary PCs. Not just real value, but real *liquid* value.

Lots of speech is banned though.  Child porn, for example.  It's not hard to ban speech and it's not hard to ban mathematics (just look at laws against distributing DRM breaking software) 
The government can ban whatever it wants so long as the supreme court lets them. 
That doesn't mean that they can **stamp out** bitcoin, any more then they can stamp out child porn and drugs. But they can certainly make it illegal.

1) When Dowalla started out, it advertised itself as being irreversible, which is important when bitcoins are also irreversible.  That turned out not to be the case, but perhaps not for MtGox.  (and, by the way Dowalla had a ton of growth, and bitcoin was probably a major part of that. You'd think they wouldn't want to upset something that's been a major driver of their success) 
2) And that leads to  which is that lots of bitcoin users already have dowalla accounts
3) it's cheap. 25 cents per transactions.  Much, **much** cheaper then western union. 
What I'd really like to see: for withdrawals, why not just mail a check?  There are printers that can print checks, and you can even get them printed with a direct-printed envelope so that you pull off the perforated edges.
Mailed checks would be a great way to get withdraws quickly. Depositing with a check still has all the problems of other issues. 
Also, aren't bank transfers reversible anyway? There is a problem with the banking system as a whole, things aren't 'settled' for a long time and can be reversed. It just wasn't built for the internet.

If you disagree with someone you should first ask yourself what their *goals* are and whether or not their actions go to further *their goals*.  If they match, then *they're probably not stupid*

My friend managed to do all that pretty cheaply.  It just takes work. If someone wanted to return something, they sent it back and he refunded their card.

The famous [424242.42424242 bitcoin transaction]( that happened when MtGox got hacked, to prove they still had control of the coins.

Yeah, but the difference is you have insurance on cash in the bank. 
Ultimately, that needs to be the way bitcoins work.  You buy an insurance contract such that if coins you have hosted on a certified provider are stolen, you get reimbursed. 
Insurance companies probably wouldn't want to insure bitcoins on a person's PC, so there will probably be online systems for people to use.

But Google has been getting better at spidering stuff, people are opening more stuff up to search engines and the public web has been growing.

First of all, there's slightly better security.  Unlike entering your credit card number, or routing/checking account number there is **no way** anyone can steal your credentials or withdraw funds illicitly.  Right now, it's kind of a problem. It can make people nervous to enter their credit card details on websites they're not familiar with. 
On the other hand, it's like holding cash.  You lose your cash, that's it. It's gone. You can't get it back. Not a problem when you only store a couple bucks in it, but you wouldn't want to have a lot of money. And that could be how bitcoin ends up working.  People buy 10-20 bucks worth at a time, and use that. 
The real benefit is from people **selling stuff**.  Right now, it can be a huge pain to deal with paypal as a seller. They lock accounts and generally are assholes.  With bitcoin, there's no middle man.  You just set up your wallet, and that's it!  You're good to go. 
Bitcoin has a way to go for non-technical users though.  Using addresses can be annoying.  But as the software matures it will be a little easier.

@_date: 2011-08-15 02:13:06
Well, he said he was only looking at transaction fees, not production. If if there is $1 billion in bitcoin transactions, then there would be $5 million in fees for the 0.05 transaction fees. It doesn't matter if the coins themselves are worth $1 or $100. Of course, the more transactions the higher the costs will *probably* be but there isn't really anyway to map transaction volume to cost. 
@_date: 2011-08-09 21:47:47
[I posted about this idea a month ago, btw](  It would be a fantastic market for bitcoin.  Interestingly in lots of 3rd world countries people trade cellphone minutes as a kind of digital currency. Bitcoin would have a big advantage over that in that the coins would be international and could be used anywhere. Right now If you want to send money overseas it's a pretty complex process and hardly quick.

The problem is instability.  If bitcoin's price is **stable** then it can be used easily as a unit of account. But, if bitcoin's price is wildly unstable it doesn't work very well.  If it's melting up, people won't spend the coins at all and thus no one makes money offering bitcoin services. 
If the price is crashing, then people don't want to hold bitcoin at all. So people will buy things with BTC, but people won't want to sell because by the time the transaction is done the bitcoin will have gone down in value and they'll make a loss.

Man, you sure are dumb.  I never said I thought it was unethical. I said it was illegal.  Smoking pot is illegal but it's not unethical.  But still, if you want to get high you need to deal with at least somewhat shady people to get drugs from. But money laundering is a much more high risk activity then your neighborhood stoner. 
You're apparently too dumb to understand the difference between believing something is unethical and believing something potentially illegal -- and therefore the providence of shady people. 
I'm a big fan of anonymity online and soforth, but that doesn't mean we should be unrealistic about the world. And it's worse when people confuse ideology and reality.

Okay wow.  I slogged through his **entire** video and it's completely absurd. 
His main theory is that the federal reserve creates money by lending it with interest.  This is true, he think the fed just 'keeps' the interest payments (not true, they give it to congress, to spend along with tax money).  But let's assume that that's true.  The fed prints money, lends it, and keeps the interest. 
His whole theory about bitcoin is that the miners *lend* money and only keep the interest.  **that right there is totally wrong**.  Miners mine it, **and they keep it** for themselves.  The same way gold miners keep their gold, copper miners keep their copper and so on. We keep it.  We could lend it out if we wanted too, but we could also spend it directly. 
The bitcoin economy right now is almost completely debt free, if you consider the bitcoins on sites like MtGox to 'belong' to the account holders, rather then the sites.  If you do think of them as belonging to the sites, then they are backed 100%.  There's no 'fractional reserve' or anything like that.

Right... but there would need to be about 45 million dollars worth of purchases a day to force the price of bitcoin to $5 from people needing to buy them in order to cover their costs for the day. 
Right now there's about $1.8 million dollars worth of transactions on the block chain, so if no one was interested in bit-coins as a speculative investment, bitcoin would only need to be worth 0.25 cents to cover all transactions, assuming people held onto their coins an average of one day.

Actually, if you look you can see the buy and sell levels for MtGox and other exchanges.  There are lots of sell orders for $10, $15 and more, but no buy orders at those prices. Similarly there are buy orders sitting there for $5, $3 and so on.  But no sellers at that price. 
So, what happens?  Eventually someone will lower their sell price to the price of the highest buy price, and it gets sold, because there is an overlap. Once that overlap goes away, no more sales happen until a high enough or low enough sell order comes in. 
It's the same as the stock market, but there you have huge number of traders, plus computerized traders so trades get cleared immediately.

Well, if we already have the equipment, why would we *stop*? The question is whether or not it will become less then the cost of *electricity alone*  In that case, we would have to stop.
But remember, electricity doesn't cost the same everywhere. [Check out this table](  Residential power in North Dakota costs just $0.07/kwatt hour.  Lots of other states are 8 cents. On the other hand Hawaii costs $0.31.  "Industrial" power in Idaho costs just more.

I don't really get this argument.  If bitcoin becomes a collectors item instead of a currency, is that really that bad? 
It seems like people are somehow arguing that bitcoin will become too valuable to be used as a means of exchange.  The problem with that argument is two fold.  The first problem is: So what?  If bitcoin makes it's users rich instead of becoming a popular payment method, is that really so bad for the users? 
On the other hand, if the fact that it no one uses is means it falls in value, then doesn't that mean the price **won't** be going up?  And if the price **isn't** going up then where is the incentive to hoard?  There won't be any. 
People who make this argument don't seem to understand the concept of balance. You have two forces that cancel each-other out, and you end up with equilibrium.  If no one spends bitcoin, then the value will go down because no one will need it. If the value goes down, more people will spend it. If more people spend it, and if the more people spend it, the value will go back up. 
@_date: 2011-09-09 05:52:40
Yeah... not really. If only one person has it, it will be worthless, and thus cannot 'deflate'.  If any one node gets &gt; 50% of the mining pool, they can cause problems.  Certainly, with only one person even looking at it, btc would be worthless. 
@_date: 2011-08-14 18:59:23

@_date: 2011-07-21 16:00:42

@_date: 2011-09-09 04:09:03
Well, just to clarify, the client doesn't mine by default. You have to turn it on, but it will just do CPU mining and it's not really worth doing.  
It's not pooled, so basically it's like buying thousands of lottery tickets per second.  If you happen to get a winning ticket, then you'll get 50 bitcoins.  
But right now the 'winning tickets' are super-rare. In order to get around that, people join mining pools, so they each get a little bitcoin whenever the pool finds some. 
And on top of that, people mine using GPUs, but the bitcoin client uses the CPU, so it's basically useless. 
If you were asking this question a year ago, you might actually make a few BTC using just the client, though. 
@_date: 2011-09-16 22:56:40
Right... but it could be lower in the future.  The point is, bitcoin could drop to 25 cents and still allow for the same dollar value of daily transactions. 
@_date: 2011-10-24 03:06:43


**\*sigh\*** Another person who doesn't understand how bitcoin actually works. (In this case, he doesn't understand that difficulty is tied to the number of people using the system, so if that number goes down so does the difficulty) 
Unfortunately, that's a lot of people. The way bitcoin works is actually probably simpler then the way the dollar "Works" but all people know is that a piece of paper in their hand has value because other people will accept it. 
Until that's true of bitcoin.  People are never going to understand it. What it needs is a trackrecord of stability, over the long term.  
If bitcoin survives over, say, 5 or 10 years then it will begin to re-gain acceptance.

@_date: 2011-06-24 01:57:53
The biggest flaw right now is that the wallet.dat sits unencrypted on the hard drive.  As long as bitcoin isn't open and active, you might as well keep it encrypted. 
Additionally, you would only need to **decrypt** the wallet when you actually make a transaction. You could have the user re-enter a password when they go to make an actual transaction, and, once it's complete delete the secret key from memory, leaving only the encrypted one on disk.   The risk, then, is if people lose their passwords.

People don't need super-high security to use bitcoins. The problems have been caused by a few idiots being **incredibly** stupid: Using online wallets with totally anonymous websites (myBitcoin) or that guy who lost the wallet file for an exchange (lol) 
Bitcoin itself is secure, with any security system the first thing people try to do get around things that annoy them. So, people started using this centralized systems, many of which were run by amateurs who started early on. Obviously you have to use an exchange, but people should never have been using MtGox as a place to keep their real wealth. 
All people need to do is put their wallets on a machine, something like a cheapo netbook, and only use that machine for doing bitcoin transactions. Don't leave it online when you're not buying stuff. 
Anyway, the solution isn't crazy paranoid security measures, but rather plain old insurance. Pretty soon there will be online wallet providers who will offer actual insurance on your bitcoins. If they get hacked, the insurance provider will pay out either bitcoins or a cash equivalent to the parties. Then, the insurance company and the provider will have to work out the security restrictions.

Blocking ACH transfers to MtGox would be a pain, but preventing money from entering the system easily would also prevent it from &lt;i&gt;leaving&lt;/i&gt; the system and thus stabilizing the currency. 
One nice thing about bitcoin is that you can, of course, trade it in person with anyone. If bitcoin were more popular in one area then another, it would also be worth more in that area. In that case you could see something kind of odd in the internet age: People would buy bitcoin for cash in areas where it was cheaper, then physically travel to sell it.   Or they could mail cash. 
If it had to go 'underground' it could still work. It would be problematic for a lot of people if the government did something like freeze everyone's bitcoin on MtGox and other well known exchanges. 


They could shut down large operations, but ironically this would be beneficial for bitcoin, as it would mean it would be easier for individuals to mine on their own machines, not in competition with major operations.

That's just how bitcoin works.  When you send a small amount of money, **all** the money gets transferred from the address. The small amount goes to the other partner, the rest goes back to &lt;i&gt;another address in your wallet&lt;/i&gt;. 
It's done for added privacy (or something) but it's something of a problem because if transfer a large chunk, a lot of the money goes to a new address. The problem comes in if you you don't back up your wallet.dat right away. You could end up losing all of it.

The problem is transaction credit. When I deposit a check with my cellphone **lends me** the value of the check, at zero percent interest.  They don't really lose any money, because the actual cash stays in their vaults unless I draw down my entire account. 
Even though it takes a week for the check image to get through the system the effect is as if I have the funds immediately. 
With bitcoin, there's no transaction credit.  Maybe someone could invent something like that.
There's also the option to increase fees to boost speed.  You could have 'trusted verifiers' with access to a high speed, short term block-chain.  They'd give you a special token that expires when initial coin is fully verified, and clients can be modified to accept that token, along the unverified coins.

That's totally false.  The question you need to ask is:  "How long will it take to guess that password." 
The answer **depends on the algorithm that the hackers are using to guess passwords** 
If they are using a list with the top 1000 english words and generating guess passwords using them correctly spelled with spaces in between then a 6 word password will be guessed in 1000^6 tries, or (10^3 )^6 = 10^(3*6) = 10^12. (assuming they add 'bitcoin' to the list) 
On the other hand a totally random string like "s&amp;3H92%TL9" will never be guessed by that algorithm.  On the other hand assuming 24 lower case, 24 upper case, 10 digits and 14 symbols you have 24*3 = 72 symbols and a 10 character password has 72^10 = (10^1.8573 )^10 = 10^*(1.8573*10) = 10^18.6
So **assuming the hacker chooses an ideal algorithm for your password** your "i love protecting my bitcoin wallet" is **almost 10 million times weaker** (actually 7.2 million times weaker :). 
Of course, you can get the best of both worlds by using a password like: 
**"i love protecting my bitcoin wallet using this awesome password: s&amp;3H92%TL9"**

Bitcoin is just based on the idea of signed transactions. That stuff has been well understood for a long time.  But your idea here is taking a bunch of stuff that's in bitcoin and 'bringing it back' to solve a much simpler problem. 
All you have to do to have electronic voting is give each citizen a private key, and have them fill out an electronic ballot and have them digital sign it.  There's no need to include the concepts of a 'wallet' or 'payments' or anything else. 
The problem with this is, like bitcoin, it wouldn't be anonymous. You would be able to see the public key of the voter, just like you can see the bitcoin address (and public key) of people who spend bitcoin. 
The other problem is the problem bitcoin faces:  Hacking. You know all the worry people have about voting machines: well, people's PCs 100x worse in terms of security. If people could vote from ordinary machines there would be a clusterfuck of political parties trying to get people to run software to do their voting for them, hacking, the whole mess.  Just like there's hacking now for bitcoin. 
TL;DR: 1) You don't need all the complexity of bitcoin, simple pubic key crypto and document signing is enough and 2) This would get hacked to hell. 
If you gave everyone a secure device to vote on, that would be good

Also, why not write it down. 


Slightly is right. If you simplify it by including "" in your word list you end up with 1001^6 instead of 1000^6.  So it would take
1,006,015,020,015,006,001 steps instead of 
1,000,000,000,000,000,000 steps.  Not much of a difference.

Sure, but if you think about it you probably use cash, and if you lose that cash, it's gone. 
Bitcoins are like cash.  And people are kind of discovering that having huge amounts of money in cash, and un-insured causes problems.  If I deposit my cash in a bank, and the bank gets robbed, the FDIC will cover the losses up to $250k.  With bitcoins, there's no insurance.
What's needed isn't a system that's 100% secure, but rather bitcoin **insurance** where people could pay a premium every month, and if something goes wrong, the insurance company will pay out.
One way to do that would be for individual users to sign up with an 'insurance pool' to provide insurance.  The users would set aside a certain number of bitcoins and each month they would get paid for putting those coins in the insurance pool. If something goes wrong, the coins would be transferred to the person who lost their coins. 
for customers, they would do the reverse.  Pay a fee every month to everyone in the insurance provider pool until they lose their coins. Then if that happens, they would file a claim. 
You could be both an insurance provider and client if you wanted. In that case your payouts and premiums should be equal.

Interesting. I think what you're seeing is the combined result of a lot of bad news.  Plus you have things like SA users who are on a jihad to talk shit about bitcoin.
Another issue: services that allow people to sell in bitcoin, but convert to USD immediately. Those services mean that essentially, every purchase that gets made = a sale = a reduction in demand. 
But if you think about it, this could be good for the ecosystem as a whole.  If no one wanted to sell bitcoin, it wouldn't make a good medium of exchange.  Without the huge price bubble, hopefully people will be more willing to part with it. 
Finally, one of the biggest problems with bitcoin is unfortunately a lot of it's 'advocates'.  The hardcore libertarians who want to attack anyone who doesn't share their (kind of absurd) view about monetary policy. If someone who is "into" bitcoin flames you online, and makes a bunch of ridiculous points you're going to be a lot less interested in bitcoin (just look at SA)

The problem with going non-pooled is irregularity of the payout.  It could take just a day to find your first block, or it might take months and months.  Looking at the stats on deepbit.net.  Some blocks, in the past 24 hours took 3,632,371 shares to find. That took them 1 hour 24 minutes, at 3 Terahashes. Six thousand times as powerful as your single machine.  
It would take you, at 500Mhashes **11 months 15 days 10 hours** to find a block that way.  
On the other hand, the shortest one, again just in the past 24 hours, was just 29,848 shares. That would take you just **7 days 2 hours 22 minutes 25.95 seconds (and took them about 41 seconds, by my calculations.  They just say 0 hours, 0 minutes)

Of course there will be inflation, there has always been inflation. But right now there isn't much inflation at all, because the economy is doing poorly (when the economy heats up, and wages rise, that's what causes inflation. As long as we have high unemployment, there's no inflation) 
The U.S's standing in the world has nothing to do with it.  The UK Used to be  for decades, then it lost it's place.  But the British pound is still valueable.

This comment doesn't really make too much sense. The electricty use of bitcoin is related to the *number* of transactions, not the *amount*.  It takes as much electricity to verify a 10k bitcoin transaction as it does to verify a 0.01 bitcoin transaction. 
When you say 0.5 cent, do you mean 0.5 *per*cent? 


This makes zero sense. How would the price of an individual bitcoin factor in to how much electricity it costs to verify transaction.  It takes the same amount of electricity to verify a transaction when bitcoin is $0.01 as it would when bitcoin is $1m. 
This post is very weird, and the math doesn't make much sense at all. It should just be downvoted.

There is no way to know where the bottom is.  This could be the bottom, or they could go down to $5, or $3 or $1 or $0.1.  There's no real floor, because people don't require bitcoins for anything.  And the stuff people do buy or sell in bitcoins gets repriced frequently as the price changes. 
If everyone buys bitcoins in order to buy something, and the seller immediately sells, then the price changes wouldn't really matter, and the price of bitcoin could be pretty low.

OccupyWallstreet does accept bitcoin donations.  However, the reality is that there's a big difference between the policies that OWS is promoting and what bitcoin is about. OWS wants to fix income and wealth inequality, while bitcoin is more about making it easy to transfer money on the internet, and liberate people from using a government backed currency.  
It doesn't really help with income inequality, in fact because if bitcoin ever became super-popular it could make income inequality worse.

Fractional reserve banking *started* with gold. 
*If* People store their bitcoin on their own computers, then you can't do fractional reserve banking because there is no bank.
You can do fractional reserve banking if you store your bitcoin in a pool with everyone else -- if MtGox started lending bitcoins, it would be doing fractional reserve banking. 
All fractional reserve banking means is that  you lend out part of the deposited as loans.  So if 500 people deposit $10 each, the bank would have $5k in assets.  It lends some of that out, it's doing fractional reserve banking. The bank can do it with any asset it has on file.

You're missing an important point, though.  The more nodes on the network, the higher the difficulty.  If BTC sticks to around $16, then adding more hardware to the network won't get you a constant return on investment. If one investor plunked down $10m on bitcoin hashing, they'd double the speed of the network. But they would instantly boost the difficulty as well. 
Ultimately increases in the mining rate are going to be governed by a combination of how much they think the difficulty is going to go up vs. how much they think bitcoin will increase in value, and with the risk that the system will collapse or decrease in value before they earn back their investment.  But you can't just add capacity to the network forever and still make money.

Well, I'm thinking to bootstrap it might be possible to have "bitcoin dealers" who could sell bitcoin locally, while maintaining a USD account somewhere.  So let's say you live in a village where there's a western union store.  
You could start your own competing store and have people overseas send bitcoin directly to you earmarked for their relatives (which would mean they wouldn't need a phone or need to be computer literate), or their relatives could show up and get local currency for bitcoins on their phones/laptops. 
Over longer periods of time, people might start accumulating BTC on it's own, as a more safe and stable way of storing wealth, especially in situations where the banking system isn't secure.

Probably not.  Right now you're increasing at a logarithmic rate of one 'zero' every month or so.  But that would require adding 10x the number of people, or the average user adding 10x the CPU/GPU power.  It's not sustainable. (or you could have, like y=3.16x increase in GPU/person and a z=3.16x increase in the number of people, so long as z*y = 10)
There's just no way the average miner is going to keep multiplying their capacity by 10 each month, the proceeds from mining aren't enough. If it was possible to mine enough to double your equipment each month, you could do that. And that was kind of the case with a 400k difficulty but not with 1.4 million difficulty and higher. If the difficulty stays stable here, you're looking at 3 or 4 months. If it multiplies by 10 again, you're looking at a 4 to 5 year period to get a ROI.  So it's high risk **and** it takes a long time to make back your money. 
Check out the [two month]( graph and you can see it started flattening out with then difficulty jumped from 800k to 1.3m.

There's no reason you have to use the actual wallet.dat file, you could write a bitcoin client that implements the API without using the same file structure for storage. 
What I would do is set it up in a master-slave system. Every time you spend, the main node would create an ecrypted file containing the changes, send that off to backup servers (i.e. S3, or upload using SCP or whatever).  Once the diffs are **successfully** uploaded to multiple backup locations **then** the spend actually goes through. 
That way if the machine with the client goes down, you'll be able to recover the wallet up to the point where the spend was about to go out.
That said, your idea could work too. It's essentially the way those secure password fobs work (I think)  Each one uses a pseudo-random digit that you can detect if you know the seed.

There is a big difference in terms of victimless and 'victimful' crimes in terms how easy they would be to catch.  Cameras can't tell you a guy is walking down the street with a friend or hooker. They can't tell you if a package handed from one person to another contains drugs, etc.

If you look at Radeon GPUs, a 6990 can do ~800Mhash/sec, and according to AMD's site it can do "5.40 TFLOPs Single Precision compute power o 1.37 TFLOPs Double Precision Compute Power "
A single precision FLOP uses 32 bit floats, while a double precision uses 64 bit floats.  I haven't looked a the kernel code but I assume the kernels use 32 bit floats and perform integer ops to do it. So in that case it would take 6750 FLOPs to compute a hash. Or to be more specific a card could do 6750 floating point ops in the time it takes to do a hash.

You could just use your credit card to buy things, or do a cash advance. 
However, cash advance rates usually have a higher interest rate.  So actually buying BTC and selling it right away for cash might actually save money in the long run. 
But this would only be an issue if you needed to buy something from somewhere that didn't take cash. 
@_date: 2011-12-28 16:46:37
You need to install the [bitcoin client]( and get that setup. The client will generate addresses for you to use to receive money. In that case, the bit-coins will be sitting directly on your computer, so if your hard drive crashes (or whatever) you'll lose the coins, so make sure to keep them backed up. 
The new clients include encryption, so you don't need to worry about installing truecrypt or anything like that (although, it's useful software on it's own!) 
The other option would be to setup an account on MtGox or something, and then send the coins right from deepbit to MtGox, but in that case you won't be storing the coins yourself, on your own machine.

Who writes two OSes. 


Git uses merkle trees to verify software repositories, the same system bitcoin uses to verify the block chain.  Git was written by Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux Kernel. Someone who can write a a real production OS will need to understand how to write secure code. But someone who writes a toy OS will probably have written something totally insecure. 
Anyway, the real question is how much they are paying. If they have the cash for the best, they'll get the best. If they don't, they won't.

It's not even close to the anonymity of cash.  Each dollar you have has a serial number.  Imagine if every dollar you received had it's serial number associated to the unique ID of your wallet once you put it in. And that this database was totally public.  You could buy as many wallets as you liked, but maintaining even a little anonymity would be difficult.

Food prices haven't gone up that much, and the price of oil is still less then it was in '08. You can't say "the value of the dollar has gone down" when most things denominated in dollars are still the same price. Gold has gone up, but that's not because the value of the dollar has gone down. Wages have actually gone down.  In a true inflationary situation, wages will also rise, and unemployment will be very low.

@_date: 2011-07-18 02:07:05


Doesn't matter.  Not only would it do you any good, the transactions are public anyway.
If you kept the key encrypted in memory,  you would need to keep the key used to decrypt the encryption key in plain text to use *that*.  If you used some other scrambling method, it would be **effectively** in plain text because all you would need would be the scrambling function in order to extract it.

Uh, yeah... This is a huge problem because tons of coins could have the same 8-character code.
Honestly these coins seem kind of cheap and cheesy. 
@_date: 2011-10-25 20:32:33
Yeah, but you can put in a higher bid. 
If you understand the bid volume charts it looks like this
Say, 100 bitcoins for sale at $2.80, 300 bitcoins for sale at $2.90 and 400 bitcoins for sale at $3.  
If you want to buy 800, you have to bid $3.    You get those coins and the 'market price' temporarily goes up to $3.  Then, when no one else wants to buy, the 'market price' drops until people can sell their coins to people who want to buy it at $2.80. 
But a huge spike won't get new traders excited, you have to buy slowly and raise the price over time to create the illusion of an uptrend other people can join. 
The problem is you have to 'excite' enough people to buy the coins that you bought before you started the trend.  If there aren't enough people watching to make that happen, it won't work, you'll just end up with bitcoins you can't sell at a profit. 
In a down market, you're better off dumping coins and causing a panic, then buying low. 
@_date: 2011-11-08 07:38:09
So, the bitcoins are sold for cash, used to buy stocks?  Seems lame. 
@_date: 2011-09-27 04:43:38
Sounds like a pain. You have to call them and get them to turn the system on to withdraw your money? What's to prevent someone from impersonating you to get the money? 
What happens if they go out of businesses?  The bitcoins would be lost forever, or they might just activate the machines and 'confiscate' all the btc. 
@_date: 2011-09-13 14:17:24
The problem, though, is that once they 'release' the block-chain, it will (or should) revert to the original, valid chain.  Which means they need to blow a shitload of computer power 'sitting' on it which means free bitcoin to all the other miners, or else they're not really accomplishing anything.

**Haha, Actually I bet these aren't "bugs" at all. **
The way his script is witten, it **looks** like it verifies the data the file path "**$signature**" which is the second command line parameter. 
But in fact, it reads from a file referenced in the variable"**$signiture**" 
So, if you were **demoing** this to someone you could do 
    cat whatever.txt
    EcDSA.verify output whatever.txt pub.key
**the contents of "whatever.txt" would be output to the screen when you run cat, but openssl would actually read a completely different file, whatever you'd set the $signiture environment variable too**
The misused "&amp;" and "&amp;&amp;" could be a similar trick as well.

Jeez this guy sounds insufferable. 
And the rest of the interview was SO BORING talking about the 'economics' of their ridiculous hippy coffee shop/club about people donating coffee to each other in exchange for software development or whatever. 
Then they have their own virtual currency JUST for the coffee shop.  It's absurd. 
Mostly, it will be yet another SF media/developer wankfest where you can 'network' with the 'right people' in order to make a lot of VC money or whatever. But still, these people just seem insufferable.   It might work with one or two shops in SF/NYC and a few places like that, but the idea that there are enough high-end 'knowledge workers' to make this into a large thing is absurd. 
This guy seems to think btc is interesting, but he doesn't want to run a business himself. I've often thought that actual bitcoin insurance is the way to go. You would put your PTC on a wallet on some server, and whoever runs that server would have an insurance policy with an insurance company that would pay out if the server blew up, or whatever. 
@_date: 2011-08-05 21:26:45
so store them in more then one location. 
Part of the problem, though is the fact that the wallet.dat file changes after a certain number of transactions, so if you have them backed up in a secure location, and you send coins, the coins get transferred too a new address.  It's supposed to make things more anonymous, but it doesn't guarantee anonymity and it makes transferring coins more risky
IMO that should be fixed, or at least give users the option to send coins back to the original receiving address after using them.

You're saying his conclusions are correct. And it's true that the more people who mine, the more electricity will be used. 
But the actual dollar value of a bitcoin is irrelevant to the size of the transactions. If you spend "$100" worth of bitcoins, the value is the same whether you use 0.1 bitcoins or 1000 to do it. 
The actual mathematical formulas he's using are nonsensical.

Actually, you can see how he probably tricked them just looking at his script screenshot: 
I posted this in another thread, but I think there's a good chance that the "bug" in his script is actually designed to fool people who think they're watching him verify the signature in person, which is how this guy "verified" himself to people. 
The way his script is witten, it **looks** like it verifies the data the file path "**$signature**" which is the second command line parameter. 
But in fact, it reads from a file referenced in the variable"**$signiture**"

    EcDSA.verify output whatever.txt pub.key
**the contents of "whatever.txt" would be output to the screen when you run cat, but openssl would actually read a completely different file, whatever you'd set the $signiture environment variable too**
I don't know why he didn't fix it before posting a screenshot to his blog. Maybe stupidity/lazyness.  These are just simple shell scripts, he's not a serious coder (Or he would have switched out the openssl binary, not just made a 'typo' in a bash script)

The problem though is that you're going to want to verify that the cards are legit, non-counterfeits by tearing them open and scanning their private keys.  If you don't, there's always a possibility they are not legit. 
*assuming they cannot be counterfeited* then they are more secure. There's also the problem of someone with an x-ray scanner or something someone might be able to use to read the barcode inside.

Probably not worth the cost of electricity to mine with CPUs, unless you're not paying for power. 
And honestly, if you're not paying for power and you want to mine bitcoin, it's probably best to put together a cheap PC with a powerful GPU and stick that in with your servers.

@_date: 2016-05-02 14:37:09
It's actually intentional.  He probably set the $signiture environment variable before he showed people the script. 
Remember, he "proved" he was Satoshi by doing the verification **himself** in front of people, on his own computer.  All he would have to do is set the $signiture environment variable to some other random message (like an old transaction from the blockchain...) and then he would be able to run the command and make it **appear** that what was being validated was something else. 
And honestly, if he was a half decent hacker he would have used unicode or something, not just an obvious spelling error.

There is literally nothing you can do with the computed bitcoin hash values. They're completely random - based on hashes of the transactions that go through the network. 
There wouldn't be any way to "predict" any of the properties of future hash values. 
One possible thing that someone might have wanted - lots of hardware capable of rapidly doing SHA256 hashing. 
Also, when bitcoin started the "reward" was hardly worth anything. I doubt anyone who got into bitcoin when it was worth about $1 would have expected it to go to $1k in a year or two - it was mostly something people were doing as a hobby. 
Also, I think what people have trouble with is the fact that no one actually "runs" bitcoin - I mean, technically everyone involved in mining "runs" in that they could theoretically choose to stop, or mine some other coin, but Bitcoin is an autonomous system.  It's not "Satoshi" who's personally rewarding people, the computer program runs on it's own, autonomously.  It needs people to supply it with electricity and hardware - but no one is "in charge" of it, no one is making decisions. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:17:22
No there wouldn't have.  First of all, no one is going to take a million dollar bet with some random guy who doesn't have a million dollars. Second of all, who is he making this bet with? If someone came up to me and tried to make that bet I would assume they had something up their sleeve. 
Thirdly, a million dollars is way less then the value of the bitcoins Satoshi actually mined.

@_date: 2016-05-02 12:29:51
My guess is this guy is pulling some kind of scam. He's claiming to be Satoshi in order to scam someone out of a lot of bitcoin for _something_, he can point to the news articles, etc

@_date: 2016-05-05 09:21:26
The errors are there to make signatures appear valid when they're not. 
I posted an explanation here:  
The way his script is witten, it **looks** like it verifies the data the file path "**$signature**" which is the second command line parameter. 
But in fact, it reads from a file referenced in the variable"**$signiture**" 
So, if you were **demoing** this to someone you could do 
    cat whatever.txt
    EcDSA.verify output whatever.txt pub.key
**the contents of "whatever.txt" would be output to the screen when you run cat, but openssl would actually read a completely different file, whatever you'd set the $signiture environment variable too**
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:36:49
That's not how crypto is supposed to work. People don't verify their own signatures.  Anyone can write a script that will fake verifying a signature. Why not release the signed message for everyone to read and verify themselves?  
If he really did this, literally all he has to do is copy and paste the signed message he created in front of this guy and release it online. He hasn't done that. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 19:27:21
Did he have a choice? 
@_date: 2016-05-02 11:59:37
Because it's a scam.  He's running the code himself in front of people rather then simply distributing the signed text. Probably using a hacked client of some sort. 
No way this guy is for real.

They can increase capital reserve requirements at banks, for one thing.  That's very uncommon nowadays. 
They can also sell treasuries they own for cash, then take that cash out of circulation.
It's called "Tightening" and they do it all the time during normal operations (i.e. before 2008).  You don't need to do it "in detail" because it's completely straightforward.  The fed can print money when they feel like, and they can also destroy money if they feel like it.

Actually, the most likely thing is that you actually entered the address correctly to begin with. 
A gox transaction goes through immediately when you submit it, so if you entered a true valid address, the coins would be gone and there's be nothing the staff could do. 
If you entered an invalid address, then it wouldn't have gone through. 
Check the timestamp on the transaction and the timestamp on when you submitted the ticket. 
EDIT: I just noticed you said you pasted it in with an extra line break.  A line break doesn't actually change the numerical value of an address.

See, here's the problem. You're a fucking idiot. If there wasn't a valid definition of a transaction on the block chain - then bitcoin couldn't work. Bitcoin works because everything is well defined. 
Every computer on the bitcoin needs to be able to verify transactions as legitimate. In order for that to happen, they have to have a precise definition of what makes a transaction valid. 




No, if you change any of the core components, you will effectively fork the currency.  You wouldn't be able to spend coins mined on your "new" definition with people still using the old currency, and people mining the old currency wouldn't be able to spend the new coins with people using the old currency. 


No, the government can blacklist certain tokens if it wants. It can blacklist bitcoin - that is the current bitcoin blockchain - that won't stop bitcoin completely, but it would shut down any 'legitimate' use in the U.S.

Yes, it's really true. 


The boxes that the ASICs come in also have computers inside of them, which are wired directly to the ASICs and control them with electrical signals. But the term "ASIC" refers to chips.  A lot of people in bitcoin use "ASIC" to refer to both the chips and the boxes the chips come in. 
But the computers controlling the ASICs will have barely any power, and if you tried to do anything else with them, the actual ASIC chips couldn't be used.

@_date: 2013-05-12 20:28:15
That's not really true, and especially as the network moves more towards ASICS it will be less and less true.  The problem is that while those supercomputers might be 1/8th as fast doing SHA-256, ASICs won't be able to do anything else. 
If it were pure GPU, then you could make that claim. 
Also, keep in mind the network is decentralized.  If you compared all the computing power in Amazon, Google or the NSA's data centers you might get a different result.

While theoretically it could be fabricated entirely (as in totally fake, planted evidence), but excluding that possibility, even if it was a sting or a scam on him, he still agreed to have the guy killed.  Plus, if it was a sting/scam then he still fell for it. 
This guy was an idiot and a tool, he couldn't even figure out how to use curl over tor without asking on Stack Overflow, which he did with his real name.

If bitcoin didn't have a mathematical definition, it wouldn't work. You just make it illegal to make valid bitcoin transactions. You can make it illegal to have or transfer a copy of the block chain. 
The basic weakness of bitcoin is that it requires a network to be active. A government dead-set on banning bitcoin could impose a china-style firewall that blocks any bitcoin related traffic.
