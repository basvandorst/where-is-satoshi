heh........ bitconnect
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:48:07
Thanks! 
Edit: do you think (for a week or so) to keep around 5k in Coinbase would be fine? Might split some profits depending where the price goes

You don’t

*prays on everything holy that you’re my secret santa* ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:30:16
In addition, You would have to move to an exchange to cash out to USD.  Can't do it directly from Trezor wallet correct?
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:32:54
Can't deposit crypto to a bank! (yet) haha - yea fiat
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:28:19
so technically speaking, if I have X amount in my Trezor, when moving into GDAX to cash out to USD (fiat?) it would be worth more.. correct?  Also, not doing that.. HODLR here lol but just for my knowledge 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:58:25
Annnnnnd it’s canceled
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:00:53
I’m with you. Mine says processing 
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:25:16
So let’s say I have 2k in Coinbase and I send it over to trezor. Then it goes up $100. Everything updates in trezor as the market updates? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:51:55
I wouldn't say begging by any means.  But no problem, I will go ahead and delete this
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:19:39
I have. But just want to make sure from the community. Never hurts to ask
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:31:55
Damn transaction fees lol. Theoretically speaking, even though its 2k on Coinbase. I should 100% keep it on the hard wallet. Right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:48:21
Also, would this be it? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:06:44
What is fiat? Another crypto! Really only into bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:22:48
because i said it would... *cheesy grin*
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:16:04
Do I have to leave it plugged in? Also everything will operate as normal with the fluctuation of the market and my bitcoin right? As it rises my BTC rises, vice versa?
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:29:32
Thanks! But I still don’t think that answers my question haha. I do use Coinbase. I am just curious as to if I will be able to trade B2X directly to BTC or have to cash out B2X then buy BTC with that money? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:55:43
I’m about 50% to my first BTC... you can totally help me out also ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:35:33
Can you be my dad lmao
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:55:46
Awesome. Just did that. Is there a “transaction history” sort of tab where I can see that transaction? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:32:19
I respect that
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:21:52
I feel like you got me as your Reddit secret Santa ������
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:46:19
Even as a noob, i totally agree with you here.  The adoption of Bitcoin is really just starting.  If you look at things the way I do.. People are just starting to get into this and realize the potential it has and will have in the future.  I think this dip that it's taking sucks, but all in all, it will rise back to ATH's and Bitcoin will remain on top. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:54:35
*rips back of trezor off*
Nah man, only some stupid motherboard crap. It’s a lie!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:30:44
I have about 2k invested. Is Coinbase good or do you suggest I store my bitcoin somewhere else? If so, where should I store it and how do I transfer? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:55:28
Thats awesome!  Currently trying to start my business right out of college.  Feel free to spread the help! ;) haha 1N3NZFhLvCcf8pEgrKUMYs1piFGQSATsjs
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:19:59
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:54:05
I was saying, if I wanted to cash out some usd, so I transfer to Coinbase then to my bank...
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:04:09
Awesome. Thanks. I do see it pending
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:16:45
I’ve been using Coinbase since before trezor. Do you think it’s fine to transfer to Coinbase then transfer it out? I’m not going to cash out, I’m just wanting to get all my info together
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:13:55
AND THEN IT CRASHED. I’m dying of laughter
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:36:00
*bows with great thanks*
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:39:24
Sweet. Thanks for looking out! Transferring Is straight forward?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:25:01
So one thing I’ve noticed is that the BTC price on trezor has been lower than GDAX or Coinbase. Which is the most accurate?
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:12:27
Literally just bought one before I saw this lol. But yea I was looking at it. Seems straightforward. Keep BTC on there and then just check prices/buy from an exchange like Coinbase then transfer I presume?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:08:43
Also do I have to leave the trezor plugged in the whole time while it’s transferring from GDAX to trezor? Since it’s delayed And also, with the trezor, everything will update as the market updates right?
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:00:27
So I got trigger happy and just did them all at once. But it looks like GDAX is having a delay. How long does that usually take to show up?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:06:58
Inevitable as in... it’s bound to climb
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:00:49
I really value your opinion because I’m quite new at this as it is. So with the fork coming I’m a little unsure of what to do lol. So if I move my BTC there now, I can instant sell B2X (if I decide to)
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:39:54
I was looking into Trezor. Is there a program that goes along with it? How does one transfer from Coinbase to trezor?
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:11:32
And won’t it already be on the exchange in Coinbase as well?
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:19:08
UPDATE: Huge thanks to everybody for the help! I was able to transfer from coindbase to GDAX and then to my trezor. No problems! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:47:35
It talks about sends and receives, but I’m assuming it’s referring to sending and receiving from other parties. Not if we can transfer B2X to BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:20:02
Now all you need is a Lambo.. you're on your way young padawan 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:50:21
It dropped 2 dollars guys.. better buy now ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:34:40
Why to GDAX then trezor? Out of curiosity 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:20:33
Oh, also a quick question. Not that I plan to cash out anytime soon, but with trezor, it will allow me to cash out to USD at anytime right?
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:05:03
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:53:21
So essentially I can move my B2X to here and then sell it/trade it for BTC?
