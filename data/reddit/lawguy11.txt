Bitcoin is not about establishing an honor-based currency. I can't even believe I'm reading this kind of rhetoric here. The whole point of Bitcoin is to remove normal human flaws from the operations of our currency.
If the success of our currency relies on the abstract hope that people behave honorably, we have created a currency doomed to failure and we deserve to lose money in it. We can't blame GHash for problems in Bitcoin's underlying infrastructure.

The whole purpose of bitcoin is to create a better alternative to fiat currencies. Short-term solutions aren't acceptable here. We need a coin that is impenetrable to manipulation.


How exactly is anyone holding GHash accountable? By bad-mouthing them until they do what the community wants? Get real. Lack of accountability is what bitcoin is all about. There is no controlling agency to turn to. We need a real solution to keep bitcoin viable regardless of the actions of any group of people.

Urgency drives change. If a short-term solution is implemented, it'll be another reason for the community to do nothing for another few years until there is a problem again.
As someone mentioned in another comment, people have been talking about this problem since 2012. Two years later, nothing has happened. Now that we're actual facing a crippling problem, real solutions are on the table—like a hard fork. If we give this problem a temporary fix, those real solutions become inconvenient and will fail to obtain the support they need. If people can sit on their hands, they will.
