Furthermore, this is based on old tech of 22nm. They will be able to not only increase the hashrate significantly but decrease the power consumption as well. Then again it is powered by hydroelectric energy and being in Norway I could see them using the residual heat to heat up the local communities. Then being liquid cooled it would be an easy way to transfer the heat to other facilities. Awesome

That is the bad thing about bitcoin and mining when you finally have a good thing come along it's hard to believe.  However, that tech and people behind the product is good enough for me. They have a shuttle run in Feb 2018 already scheduled and finished miner by June 2018. Shuttle runs aren't just some you do one day and have the chip the next. Email them if you have any questions that's what I have done.

This company is going to change the industry and set a new standard for affordable clean mining in which, it needs to move forward.

From their whitepaper I got this:
A Norwegian with 2 Americans have developed and patented an ASIC chip and miner that includes the following.
                
67% reduction in of logic circuits, can place more active circuitry on the same die size
80% less power consumption and 1/3 the price of manufacturing cost
10x faster than current chip designs (400Gh per 3 x 3mm chip)
Liquid cooled for maximum efficiency 
Powered by renewable hydroelectric energy in Norway with near ZERO emissions 
 
What is crazy about this is that it is on the 22nm SOI process. It is going to be awesome to see the efficiency on the 12nm or lower process. Even on a 16nm could produce 800Gh per chip.
 
Since this is on old tech with the 22nm SOI process, the power consumption will significantly reduce as the chip sizes decreases. 
 
This is just a blip from Cryptotech.no whitepaper and they have a press release as well on the website.

I am so glad this is happening in Norway! Great people, great culture, awesome brødskive today, tomorrow, the next day, the next day after that, then Grandioso (number one dish in Norway) hells yea to everyday!

I don't think I would ever get on board with POS. I don't mind a collaboration between POS and mining but just POS no way.

I talked to the Norwegian briefly and this is what I got back from it. To me it seams that they are offering this tech to the people for affordable mining because their tech is bigger then just ASIC. He told me that in 2-5 years their tech  will be used in everyday hardware that you have around you (basically any chips produced). Mining is a byproduct of their tech which allows them to easily move into the mining industry. This is groundbreaking tech and I am excited to watch it grow!

I am a newbie and was wanting to see what you guys thought on this service. I checked out the technology behind it and checks out. It's called Cryptotech.no. Let me know what you think because it looks from what I have read to be the biggest breakthrough since the ASIC miner. I haven't invest anywhere yet but don't have the space of miners at home.
