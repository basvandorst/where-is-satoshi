If your address starts with a "3" it's segwit. If it starts with a "1" its not

This is the laziest, craziest ask ever. Good lord

Just transfer the funds to a wallet you control. Use the sidebar to figure it out. Read the sticky post on the front page. You should have all the info you need there!

Will this be Segwit compatible? My major beef with Sentinel and Mycelium is that they aren't

Bob, why don't you take yourself over to Google and help yourself?

Its a newer bitcoin protocol that reduces the overall transaction transmission size by roughly half. You may have made a transaction and seen a "sat/byte" figure (satoshis or .00000001BTC per byte of data); this is the cost to make your transaction that gets paid to miners. You literally pay a fee per unit/bye of data. If you keep the sat/byte the same, but halve the transmission, you pay half the cost to transact. 
Segwit addresses are formatted with a "3" in front: like this 36rLTdrXwBhA5yN7BaMhbAmxxxxxxxxxxx
edit: note that Segwit is fully backwards, frontwards and sideways compatible with vanilla Bitcoin wallets - you don't loose anything by using it.

If you just plug your Nano Ledger S in and look at your wallet (advanced), you'll see your Segwit2x balance.

That's nice to think about

Feels good to be appreciated. Fuckin' Bob

From my point of view, this is an unacceptable way to handle this fork. Treating the opposing sides as equal in terms of their credence and claim to the Bitcoin (BTC) name is absurd.
Gemini, please just: list B2X as a separate asset, or offer a way for BTC holders to recover their B2X, or just do nothing! Don't go jumping ship mid-stream!

Coinbase just released a notice to the exact same end: PoW will dictate the block chain that moves forward as BTC

Lots of recommendation here for Trezor - that's fine, it's a great wallet by all accounts. Specific to your concern about 2X, look at a Ledger: Ledger announced a service that will allow you to split your BTC/2X. After that, you can dump your 2X or whatever. I also really like my Ledger

Gemini has been  maybe from the beginning. I don't think they will even list
Bizcoin

Wow. Total 180, did they not enjoy all the positive feedback they received?
