There may always be conflict, but it definitely not the fault of humans. It's been in our DNA for a long time. Chimpanzees have all out warfare with one another, and it's been well documented.

Idea: early adopters give small amounts of btc to people who are willing to learn how to use it. They appreciate small amount of cash and become slightly more familiar. After a few installments, people will try using it on their own. Then they tell their friends.

Maybe seminar was a bad choice of words. Workshop maybe? And with how small of a town Aspen is. People will come to anything out of the ordinary. They just had a rubber ducky race that sold 30k ducks at 5 bucks a pop. They have Mac and cheese contests with local restaurants that the entire town shows up for. Maybe a booth at the weekly farmers market/crafts thing. 
I envisioned a small room with 5-20 people listening to me explain why they should move some savings to btc.  
Edit: even getting other businesses set up with Bitcoin would be worth it. There is a ton of international tourists. Especially from Brazil, Australia, and other European countries. Travelers would benefit from using bitcoin and avoiding exchange fees. Merchants will enjoy extra business and lower fees.

The same reason millions use it every week. Because it isn't THAT hard to not fat finger something that important. And, if you are dealing with even a semi-reputable merchant/person/website, they will probably refund or help you resolve whatever "fat finger" mistake you made. It's just not BITCOIN'S responsibility to handle these types of matters, and because of this. It will always be cheaper and faster.

Your basically asking the same scaling question that everyone is arguing about.

Sucks your getting downvoted. The average age in the big 4 firms is mid 20s because turnover is so high. The hours are long, the work is grueling and monotonous, and they pay you barely enough to make it seem worth it. The only way to make real money as a cpa in a firm is to become a partner, and the only way to do that is to be best friends with clients. Aka they make you part of the company so you don't take clients with you if you quit.    So really you have to be a social butterfly AND a cpa if you want to get rich.
I highly highly recommend getting into investigative accounting if you must stay in the industry. That work is actually interesting, catching people committing fraud is fun. And interrogations are really really fun.

Are you watching the exchanges yourself and sending the btc by hand or with a bot? I figured I couldn't possibly be fast enough to  benefit off the spread if I did it without a bot.
Also, how do you deal with all the fees? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:24:39
Awesome. I'm stealing OPs idea and making something similar.
To the moon. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:32:14
reddit hugged it to death, as is tradition.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:14:17
Even if they did, fees are too high to justify using it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:39:22
yeah. lots more. I wouldn't advertise you have that kind of money on here. Last thing you want is the attention of a bored hacker.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:16:57
Just hodl. You're good. 
Or get a trezor
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:31:06
They have gadgets to help with that now. Trezor is the one I use and I love it. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:10:13


care to elaborate on this? How would it work?
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:32:54
By filling blocks with non segwit transactions thus making fees higher for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:07:32
Sounds like OP is salty he sold at 5k
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:16:21
Wow. Your 100% right. 90% of his typed comments are" great!!! " . Good eye. Wish I could ban him lol

I feel bad for not pressuring harder. I've been telling my friends to buy since 2013. Only 2 started early this year.

Is it possible to arbitrage bitcoin across 3 exchanges, given they all have differing prices?
I've thought heavily about arbitrage, glad to see someone is getting in on it.

I think this attitude is what's keeping the prices of BCH up. I'm also HODLing all chains, just because I don't wanna risk making the wrong decision. And trust me, I REALLY want to dump my BCH. I need that money bad. but I cant risk it.

Despite all the FUD that gets tossed around. I think traders see hard forks as an opportunity, one to buy into. It could easily cause a price increase.

It's the absolute best. And that's not to say you can't buy a little extra when you feel like it's lower than normal. Or buy a little less when it seems high. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:18:30
Out of the 10 friends I've told about btc, one finally took the leap about 3 months ago and bought some crypto... Except he bought LTC because, "he could actually get a few of them instead of fractions of one." Even knowing how decimals work, he chose LTC to have 'more'. it is a serious logical fallacy that doesnt necessarily need to be addressed, but it would help.

The sad thing is, they work. They get articles on facebook, buzzfeed, or whatever shill network will help advertise these coins. I have friends every few months ask me about some altcoin they've read about and how its the next bitcoin. I try to explain to them they are basically falling victim to a pump and dump scheme...but the contracts!!!!
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:48:57
I'm saying the same thing you are. There are a lot of people waiting for something that won't happen. I think this is more FUD scaring people into thinking it's another bubble. Well be back in a couple days to 2800

Comments like these make me consider diversifying. Still not sold on the ETH hype yet though. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:39:45
I think the adjustment is happening now. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:05:07
I think everyone is sitting around thinking it will though. I have several friends who keep asking when it's gonna hit 2k again so they can buy. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:46:04
I'm more or less in the same boat as you. I trade a small % of my overall holdings. I still feel like a wizard paying for my beer with the profits though!

@_date: 2017-07-18 14:03:01
Coinbase could choose to back the wrong chain in the case of a hard fork. Not saying they will, but you never really know. Under the table dealings etc.  
This would mean your bitcoins could be forcibly changed into a chain you don't want. This is totally avoidable by moving your coins. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:06:57
No because you hold the private keys. I'm not the most learned in these matters so I can't give a more detailed explanation than that. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:59:48
I guess you could call me a middle aged HODLer. I got in at 100 =] 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:18:12
I counted how many coins I bought and used over the years and it hurts. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:54:40
From what I understand, only 1 mining pool has agreed to support it.. therefore its no more valuable than any other alt coin and its bandcamp say it is.
@_date: 2017-06-17 18:31:58
About to say. I just ordered one. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:55:15
There's  huge buy wall at 2550, so I doubt it goes any lower. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:40:14
It was a dip 2 days ago. I bought 1 btc at 2550 yesterday with my ETH profits. I'm regretting it (who needs money?) but I'm not selling. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:10:21
I made the EXACT SAME POST yesterday, but I'm shadow banned or something. It never made it to /new
its funny cuz im now gonna turn it into btc at the  dip
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:54:36
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:54:46
He's probably using his celebrity status to help btc after he bought the dip. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:27:40
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:37:54
Wrong. One of the major points satoshi makes in the white paper is that PayPals built in mediation process will drive up the fees associated with all of their transactions. Whereas btc's 'frictionless' and irreversible payments would always weigh in cheaper. I understand this is a farcry from what it is today but it wasn't the original intention. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 06:20:55
I did the exact same thing last night. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:27:37
And this is why alt coins will always be a thing? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:22:40
The only good thing this kind of fanaticism has brought me, is the ability to buy when it seems like an awful idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:26:05
Oh look, an actual app that uses a crypto currency. How cool
@_date: 2017-06-27 02:34:14
Always hard to grab a falling knife. But yea, I'm with ya. I'm making profits every dip. Just have to adopt that knee jerk reaction to buy when it drops 10%. Some weeks are better than others for sure. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 07:20:35
It's still low
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:25:09
In all honesty. Take the advice above and just quit watching the price. Check back next week. It's the only way to HODL (hold on for dear life) if you get panicky. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 15:21:09
