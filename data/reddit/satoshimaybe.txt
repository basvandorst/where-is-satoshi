No, they launched on linux which in effect keeps 99% of the population from mining. I'm not saying there's not good reasons to mine only from linux, but added to the oops mine it creates a very strong impression of gaming a fast mine through stacking the odds in favor of those who are most in the know.

That's assuming (naively IMO) that a three letter agency (those with the resources for this type of analysis) care to find out. Why does Satoshi not spend his/her/their coins? Is it because Satoshi believes the FBI or NSA would be very, very interested in using blockchain analysis and metadata to track him or her down? Neither of our assumptions are very provable without more facts, so I wouldn't bet my life (or twenty years to life) on either of them.

My 10% of coins have to sit there because I can't cash out without fear of being tracked down by a three letter agency. You guys who hack Bitcoin exchanges have it made--no government gives a shit who you are and will use minimal time and effort to solve your ID. 
Or I'm an NSA plant and you are hopping into my rabbit hole of control--MUUUUHAHAHA!!!

Why are you replying to technical criticism with non-technical hand waving? You might as well have booed at your computer.

Satoshi criticized the current economic model while making Bitcoin--are we to say that a dev of a privacy coin can't criticize a coin that's claiming privacy while not cryptographically proving its claim? That's a very moronic rule to have if you want a robust marketplace.

Maybe, but then again if taint weren't an issue Satoshi would have spent his coins already without fear a government agency would use blockchain analysis and metadata to track his whereabouts. There's no honest way to say if either your or my assumption is correct, so better to base opinions on facts and not blindly trust tumblers based on a few heists not being tracked to the perpetrator--for all we know Satoshi is dead and the heists you are referring to had access to a criminal network to distribute the coins without the need of an exchange.

Anonymity proves anonymity--the market decides by many factors that do not always correlate with the proposed offering--Bernie Madoff's fund was a great investment solidified by the market until it was revealed to be otherwise. Dark uses masternodes which are NSA honeytrap waiting to happen.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:58:10
This is faulty reasoning. As Snowden showed us a government agency can use metadata techniques to gather information on almost anyone, but that doesn't mean anyone can do it. Agencies can/will bribe or coerce masternode operators the same way they coerced companies to release information that was/is correlated into useful data then used to link and track persons or data--why you think a government agency would even bother to do this with a currency with a less than a billion dollar market cap and almost no one actually using to transact on the darkmarkets is absurd--why bother? But if drk were to scale to bitcoin levels, you'd see exactly this behavior--now if you're cool with people being exposed to this risk, that's on you, but me, I'm calling it a scam and a disaster waiting to happen. Good luck with your investment and your consciousness.

Satoshi didn't mine a million coins in half a day--apples to genetically mutated oranges. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:00:11
You obviously misread things as the "they" paying in the above context would be a LEA paying/intimidating a node operator to glean information.
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:56:18
The idea that you refuted him is about as stupid as the idea that anyone outside a governmental agency or a billion dollar company has access to the technology to use metadata--do you really think that governments won't use the same techniques that they used on companies as outlined in the Snowden fiasco to get masternode operators to give up information? Especially if drk were to scale past the level of Bitcoin? The word chimerical comes to mind if you don't think that is what will happen.
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:52:02
It's not about missed opportunity--I don't want dark and its flawed privacy--it's about a dev lining his pocket and calling it an accident. Which in my opinion is worse that a purposeful fast-mine due to it showing a lack of understanding the code you are working with. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 12:07:27
Intelligent response. Drk guy needs to start giving reasons that the masternode system isn't an intelligence agency's wet dream. Have you guys just not looked at how three letter agency accumulated metadata from compromised companies? I know it is a good way to keep coins off the market, but it serves an anti-privacy function, so why is it there?
*changed is to it before serves.

TLDR: drk is the Milli Vanilli of privacy coins.

Satoshi's mining is well documented and so is darkcoins. It took Bitcoin almost year for 1.5 million BTC--it took Evan's team 8 hours! Followed by a rapid diminishing. Funny how that worked out--by accident... 
The NSA will oblige you if enough people are bamboozled into believing that drk anonymity is secure. Only billionaires and governments have access to metadata capturing operations, so it's absurd that you expect random people on the internet to break your coin--the blueprint has already been laid out by what was revealed by Snowden--you simply need to substitute masternodes with multi-national corporations. If spying agency can get at google and microsoft, I think they can get at your masternode operators and correlate enough information to break your coin, but maybe they won't have to bother because everyone will be using ring signature coins.
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:07:02
If you're interested in privacy, you should avoid any coin that would use a potential honeypot like masternodes. It's smart marketing to have people pay for nodes for potential profit and therefore keep coins off the market, but it makes no sense from a privacy standpoint. If someone has enough nodes or has paid/intimidated enough node operators to volunteer information, then they can use metadata techniques to create links and break anonymity. Darkcoin is not about privacy, it is about profit--if that's what is important to you, then stick with Bitcoin or stocks.

I'll have my privacy now and tested and not have goal posts moved to next time.

Have you a working zerocash?
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:53:55
Pretty simple. You send XMR to them and they send BTC to the address you provide. XMR is non-tracable and unlinkable, so they can't identify you even if they wanted. Makes BTC more private and XMR more useful--win/win.
