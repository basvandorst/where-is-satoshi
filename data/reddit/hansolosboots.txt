if amazon picks up a crypto it won't be btc probably eth/ltc for the speed. 
also can you imagine if amazon had their own crypto with instant confirmation? easily Top 3 crypto in 24 hrs

i don't think it will happen with bitcoin, the blockchain technology will thrive as non currency with the new innovative alts that we already see since bitcoin has already crossed to mainstream as a big money maker i believe it will still always at the very least be considered digital gold especially as it continues to stabilize. lots of amazing alts out there that use bitcoins white paper formula to solve world problems
@_date: 2018-09-06 15:20:40
thats why i hate when people post articles talking about a bullish switch. its very possible its manipulated.
big holders wait till it rises, sell, buy back in, they collect 10-15% more btc each cycle

i grew up during the internet 28.8K days and i never once heard it would come and go
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:18:29
this is the most retarded comment you can make for bitcoin as a whole
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:14:58
 its much easier to think of trading crypto as a huge gamble bro. you put in money and go for a ride to who knows.
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:16:28
is it that hard to believe when you see a bunch of bullish articles, it will soon dip soon? its all a manipulation system

basically you're legally going to be demanded all trade history. but in practice it's really stupid because imagine day/swing traders having to provide that. also the IRS has no man power to audit this so unless you're cashing out a few hundred thousand, its safe to just report your income made from crypto profit and call it a day. the IRS will/must restructure crypto profit income in the next few years.

you can use your seed words for any wallet not just trezor, try mycelium if its urgent

i saw TA for one more huge setback before the start coming in 2 weeks
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:51:14
don't worry. if your initial investment was more than a year ago you can pay even less tax on it per long term capital gains. i am 99.99% positive you can get away with it.

they will ask you to supply every trade 
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:47:01
correct. i'm a note 8 user, my friend who is doing really well for himself has an iphone. i ask him why and he acknowledge android has more features but he said "iphones just work, and gets it done. it's simple but so good at what it does."
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:36:46
but the thing is, to an end user/consumer trying out something new, "pretty" things is a good motivator. and you can't forget making something "pretty" is a science in and of itself, design language, industrial engineering, even picking colors taps into sociology concepts, i would say apple probably spends a shit ton on aesthetics as other products that create new hardware in the inside. its all very interesting.
@_date: 2018-10-11 03:10:28
you probably got your wallet key from a scam site meaning they had it all along

he would've brought it to the masses with really easy to understand concepts. steve jobs wasn't only about awesome technology, i would say his actual genius was behind how well he brought complicated new technology to the public and how fast it was mass adopted.
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:25:24
marketing genius can be measured by sales right? apple doesn't make anything really state of the art, i.e. they just recently introduced wireless qi charging. but they can sell that shit really good. bitcoin use with an apple spin would bring crypto to a wider use adoption to the masses.

@_date: 2017-11-30 14:55:09
we're basically in a very early stage of figuring out the the value of btc. i at least feel that this is one of a few bodies of beliefs btc owners have.
if you're a long term hodler and/or do some semi day trading, you must view everything going on for the next few years as a way to normalize and find its true value of btc. only then will it open up to more merchant spending i.e. currency.
no one will know what the end value will be, 10K, 100k, etc. but at the very least, the technology and theory of bitcoin is good enough to replace gold. and when i read people talking about btc as digital gold, it makes a lot of sense to me. 
but i guess this only rings true to those in the same camp as i am.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:30:26
yeah but socially and culturally opinions are very strong persuasive forces. if the people believe in it like gold or diamonds, then it will continue to build. if it fails because the popular crowd doesn't believe in it, its just another cool formula written by a very intellectual person.
value of bitcoin has a lot to do with human persuasion by the masses. it's doing great so far though!

needs to live on an exchange if you want action

what a shitpost
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:46:29
can you buy candy with gold? can you give gold to your landscaper? i thought the same as you but then i realized two points:
- using it as currency now is stupid because of the value of btc still rising. start using it when its stabilizes and stops growing (at least so fast)
- if you think of btc as digital gold, it helps me realize that there is huge value in that and in fact its okay if it can't be used as currency just yet
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:57:00
Eventually, using BTC will be like MySpace and another crypto can become the facebook
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:55
mycelium is excellent and you can connect it to your nano
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:06:22
only way old money loses share is if you can't buy thing with it anymore no? only when crypto can buy things that old money can't will the takeover commence
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:19:09
isn't that what i'm saying? until old money can't buy things new money can (shares of purchasing power) we will never enter your cyberpunk middle earth realm
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:02:48
cryptocurrency won't grow if everyone buys new money with old money if they can't buy things that old money can buy. apply your idea with the same ideology of 'Separate but equal." 
Secondly, it makes a lot more sense and more global acceptance to consider bitcoin the new Digital Gold. You can always keep it to be safe but also back old money with it if need be.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:14:39
sold high and bought low and made ez 0.03 profit
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:26:20
2-3 days and you'll get it returned bc there's a high chance other transactions will cut in line haha
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:52:48
yeah math is spooky

myspace was incredible when it first came out until another product, facebook came out. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:32:23
so you are saying btc will thrive bc it can be considered as digital gold  as opposed to the value of bitcoin dependent on its liquidity (out side of exchanges, p2p, etc). thats a good point to bring up
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:07:04
Libertygrid sounds kinda calming
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:48
it could also dip so you get a better price, works both ways man
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:21:23
how come no decent article in the past week have encouraged spending btc? the value of btc is affected by how many vendors are on board with taking it as a payment. if there is no increase in spending activity, then vendors will mind as well close that outlet out. i bought a PC on black friday when it was at $8200/btc from new egg and i was really proud of myself.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:05:56
atm... lol those rates are horrible
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:11:56
because it went from stones, tobacco crop, paper crop, gold back paper, fiat, now btc. that's your ideology right? i just don't think old money will be completely switched in our lifetime so your manifesto is true maybe in a couple hundred years but when we are both in our 30s+ and old money is still 100%, i don't think it'll switch in the next 50 years for us. thats all i'm saying. you can still switch back and forth and still reach 100% new money but it will take more than our life time. the day VHS switched to DVD it still was around for 5-10 years. People still buy CDs and mp3s have been out for 20 years. etc. 
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:57:50
how else do you withdraw?
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:48:27
gdax has no fees though
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:28
i mean its a famous quote so yeah 
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:09:32
it'll be hard but i can see in the future spouse assets will include crypto
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:41:26
exactly, you do it with exchanges that don't have USD pairings like binance. instead of transferring it it and paying a fee to GDAX, you can just use USDT. its exactly 1:1 USD:USDT
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:48:08
you have the right to respond the way you did don't worry
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:48:18
yea i thought this was pretty self explanatory...
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:25
do your research, its a short term strategy when you forsee a trend of hard dipping like today.
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:59:39
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:05:55
you didn't lose anything unless you cashed out. just move it to tether and wait it out
@_date: 2018-02-08 03:45:41
if you're satisfied, thats the most important thing. glad you made money during the crash
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:04
i do this a lot during day long dips and it saves me a bit of money, never had a problem with it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:49:15
Yea literally the definition of fiat lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:37
i don't care if i created it, they won't ever have the manpower to audit millions of traders. its the risk that i, and the million of other traders take.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:49:10
it won't be a scam when you can use it to pay a mortgage, better yet for all lenders
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:15:22
you're misunderstanding me, i'm talking about the scope of btc more than its end value per btc. like i would sell my house for btc, and i want a btc bank to lend the buyer in btc, etc. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:25:44
everyone holding alts trade for BTC since btc is always the first to start the potential bull market. once the bull market is in full swing, people take their BTC profits and buy back into alts and the alt market thrives again. this is the cycle.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:51:03
because tether isn't fiat.... cashing out means the money is not on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:38:38
what if I told you the majority of crypto owners don't pay taxes on them
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:18:06
that ended fast lol
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:28:11
Maybe a higher likelihood of reaching someone who can murder.
