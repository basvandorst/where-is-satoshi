Yeah, I was gonna say definitely either some where near Rutgers or Princeton.  Maybe even both! I'll pay a few visits 
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:11:21
I am not interested any more in any company "accepting" bitcoin. When they start holding a % then i would be intrigued. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 18:35:45
Still better then paper. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 03:58:32
funny he puts Bitpay up front and Bitcoin in parenthesis. We get it Alex. You are just accepting bitcoin to convert to dollars. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 19:26:20
Yeah, I'm pretty surprised this feature isn't getting more attention.
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:44:05
Hmm, i thought i was helping by running a full node. But it looks like i only got 8 connectins. What do i do to help out??
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:28:23
Would be nice if you can pay the fee to park in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:27:56
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:19:13
Nope. I bought Mastercard and Visa gift cards. No dice. This is 100% false. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:09:21
Wait a minute. Did the c.e.o. of bitcoin just dump all his share in the stock?? 
@_date: 2014-07-25 12:26:41
yep, i got mine on monday. they are def pretty awesome. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:00:44
Yeah, seriously...why not get paid in BTC? 
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:06:44
Fractional reserve banking. Ha! 
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:50:24
Ha, funny...my thoughts exactly. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 15:29:13
This is some grade A stuff. Thank you.  
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:48:02
+ 1 for this guy. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:31:22
Libertarians will turn as soon as they find out Bitcoin has no privacy. Zerocash to the moon!! 
@_date: 2014-07-15 06:21:45
Its under $10 billion because the more companies that accept bitcoin the more coins go back for sale. Until businesses start doing business in bitcoin We will not see any crazy rises. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:36:29
Retail? haha thats what you are worried about??? Wow. 1st World problems. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:17:56
@_date: 2014-08-19 23:41:30
Damn. Rism. You might be on too something here.....
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:46:59
This is exactly what i wanted to do. I thought spending from my cryptocard would make things pretty epic. I guess the coins are just gonna have to sit until the guy figure it out. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:41:33
Hmm...i thought it uses the priv key and after your done sending whatever you are sending, the priv key gets wiped off the phone...no? 
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:04:19
Hmm, Maybe its a not a gift card issue then?? 
@_date: 2014-07-19 03:02:30
because they aren't holding any bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-07-06 19:43:41
Ill believe when i see it. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 17:30:58
Wow. I like the sound of that. So if i have 28 btc i have 28 million bits??? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:18:39
Text would work i guess...but i feel like it would be fatser if they just read me off the public key over the phone. Pretty much what we do now when we order with a credit card. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:23:05
Yep. Already on it. Soon as i get word ill let you guys know. 
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:00:33
Is this gentleman???
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:14:16
Not true. I can see an alt coin for tipping. True micro transaction is not possible with bitcoin. Unless of course you trust a 3rd party service. But as for using pot/cannabis/hempcoin...i dont think it gives me enough reason to use over bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:47:40
You are not coining all the gold that under the ocean floors, right? 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:59:12
Hmm..is there something that potcoin, hempcoin, and canabiscoin can do that bitcoin cant? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:43:44
10X? Shit. Time to panic buy! 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:27:14
Yeah, airbitz should Def be added to that list
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:36:01
I'm still not sure if this is sarcast or not. Majority  ruling over the minority  is morally wrong. You must have not of heard about the non aggression principal,  self ownership,  volunterysim.  Orrr, have you?  
@_date: 2015-07-16 16:33:47
This is a joke. Right? 
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:04:46
Dear Rand Paul 
@_date: 2015-04-05 04:27:49
This is actually pretty crazy
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:02:41
Wadda ya know..another politician saying all the right things before he gets elected. You guys really falling for this shit again?? 
@_date: 2015-04-05 04:35:15
I ended up catching the last 15 min of it.  Looks like the government is looking for the CEO of bitcoin. Wish I knew about this earlier. I would have definitely watched it. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 04:27:26
It's on CBS right now. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 02:37:07
What if it's a brain wallet? Does that count?
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:22:45
Food is good. Ammo is better. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 11:51:14
All the statist talk...jeesus. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:54:15
That's the argument? People aren't "interesting to have your transactions stalked."?????
@_date: 2015-02-12 14:12:59
Because he's a statist?  Why else? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 00:13:13
NOW this might be gentlemen! 
@_date: 2015-02-04 05:45:51
Wouldn't this be a huge problem for all encryption,  including banks???
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:59:11
Isn't Monero a CryptoNote coin? Loads of problem with that, no? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:56:29
We're forced to trust them
