Hmm almost as if he were a one-man, completely unaccountable Fed that everyone trusts to act in the greater good. 
So instead of Fed plus a number banks conjuring money out of thin air through a well-understood process, satoshi controls fate of btc. I hope he destroyed the coins.

If it's not a currency, it's a digital beanie baby.

I'm curious. Why did you cherry-pick this example?

Or they set up the exchange, saw tiny volumes, then decided to create some demand? Don't underestimate the stupidity of the average scammer...

Hey, I work for a nonprofit called OpenMedia.org. We've accepted btc for a little while now, and this idea came to me. Glad to see I'm not the only one. Get at me with the results of your weekend!

I understand your argument here, but a counter-point: Wal-Mart is also successful because it offloads considerable costs to government and the environment, e.g. low-pay workers with no insurance consuming food stamps, medicaid, and so on. 
If widespread bitcoin adoption impacts the government's ability to print money, or banks' ability to do the same through fractional reserve, I could see it impacting the viability of wal-Mart's business model as governments begin to refuse to pay these costs or implement carbon taxes as a way to prop up budgets... Already, the hearsay is that some State gov'ts are going after Wal-Mart for causing additional medicaid/welfare expenses. 
For those of us who see the collusion between big government and entrenched financial and fossil fuel interests as a large part of the environmental problem, it seems like taking currency control out of the hands of the former and into the hands of individuals could have some interesting effects.
