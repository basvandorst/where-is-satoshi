Was this graph created by someone who doesnt understand how economics and inflation work? 20's and 30's were a terrible time for USD. You never want to have zero inflation. 
in 1929 only top 2% of US households made more than $10k  a year (not individuals... but households... as in a whole family).  Most people made less than $5k a year. 
This graph is the definition of cherry pick statistics. And is meaningless on its own.

I meant for an economy not individuals. You make valid points though.

Yeah, but the subject that was brought up is shady government shit (like Contra affair type shit). Good luck getting identities out when its a machine using the system and not a few neckbeards in their parent's basements, if they are so good at hiding FIAT imagine how much easier it will be for them to hide crypto, which is meant to be decentralized and anonymous (just aliases which add yet another degree of separation).
What about offshore shit, lots of corrupt government leaders pump their country's pensions into offshores for their families. At least with FIAT you can recover a portion of that if they get overthrown or whatever... with crypto.. good luck, noone knows where that money is or who has it (other than a bunch hashed chars that make up a string).

Transactions are traceable but you have no idea who the sender/recipients are... so... doesnt solve anythihing.. can still traffic the shit out of drugs.
