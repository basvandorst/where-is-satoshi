That's actually a very good idea, I'm kicking myself for not thinking of it.
Thank you.

pretty much, wear a mask, own a gun, thats it.
 An aquaintance of mine worked in a rural area next to a city, and always had to leave work before 5. He told me how thieves wait near smaller roads for riders, hang a rope across the street, and rob whoever comes, hits the rope and falls. He and his daughter were robbed this way, lost his phone, watch, wallet, etc...

Same to you. I'm in Karachi, you?

Profit is irrelevant sure, but if I buy a $3k machine, and it only nets me $1k in coins over a couple of months, it's not too good a deal.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:24:19
It's not really an option, I know nothing about the market, licenses, quality standards, don't have any contacts, etc... But thank you for the suggestion.

At this point India would be insane to accept us back. And as far as I'm aware no one considers it a serious option, kind of like if you proposed a Mexico, USA reunification.

Unfortunately I can't trade with nearby users due to safety concerns.
Is the personal bank to bank transfer available across countries? Like could I trade with a UK or US seller?
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:52:20
Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:02:02
Thank you as well! I'm very grateful.

Most people I know who've moved abroad have either taken their entire families with them, or are just studying abroad on scholarships. So I don't think that would work. 
Thanks anyway
The thread has a few options I didn't consider and I'll probably end up using one of them.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:10:46
I think this is the law in question if it helps clarify things.

I agree for the most part, Karachi is really a world of it's own.  
But the acquaintance I mentioned in the previous post actually lived in  the rural area surrounding Lahore. And while I've never been robbed at gunpoint in Lahore I have been pick-pocketed there.
I'd love to move to Lahore anyway, but I didn't get into Lums, So I'm stuck in Karachi for another year or two.

Thank you for the suggestion, but it just doesn't seem safe, as at the very least one person would be aware that I have a couple thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin if not cash(after purchase) that they could take very easily at gunpoint after we leave. 
It might seem paranoid, but I've heard of people being followed and mugged for a lot less. With the sheer amount of poverty here a couple grand is really quite a huge amount of money. For example if you can purchase a taxi, which costs about 1.5k you end up being able to earn 2-3 times as much as you would be able to otherwise(80-100 usd a month goes to 200-300 usd). (note I'm not certain about these figures as I heard them from a friend.)
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:43:59
Thank you! You've been very generous. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:55:19
I could, but the issue is I'm don't have enough time to leave the country for a couple of months- and have sent my passport for a visa anyway, won't be getting it back for a few weeks.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:04:34
Well, there are a couple issues with that. Namely, I don't know if I'll ever get ROI, there is some loadshedding here, power is quite expensive. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:14:35
I don't want to risk any legal issues. If worst comes to worst, I'll ask someone to buy me them from an atm in dubai, singapore or canada.
Thanks anyway
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:01:46
That's a wallet. I've already installed armoury, I'm just having trouble finding any exchange I can transfer funds to, and trust.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:53:50
They're both serious issues, and to some extent actually fuel each other. The three big issues are Lack of Education, Religon, and Corruption, and all three actually end up supporting one another.
We have our own system for all public schools, the metric system. It isn't any good, I've met very capable people who've graduated from it, but I've also met literally illiterate people who've also graduated from it. 
What happens is corruption prevents any reform from really taking place, religion encourages people to obey, oppose change, etc... And lack of education prevents them from having any options, being able to do their own research, etc...

Thank you.
I guess I'll either look into whether someone in dubai can buy them for me, or into sending funds to btc-e via a friend(if they allow third party transfers.).
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:43:00
Thank you, I'll be looking into this tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:06:55
I'm not too sure, I just know I asked around at a couple of banks, all of them mentioned the law in the title. One of them mentioned that universities and such are an exception. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:02:51
I'm not sure about all transactions, but the bank employee told be I won't be able to wire transfer any money to a business account from a personal account, and I couldn't open a business account without a business. He was also unaware of any other ways to remit money.
I'm not too sure but I think this is what they were referring to   
It's point number 29, page 14
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:02:55
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:28:16
People are already **somewhat** used paying bills via cellphone due to easy paisa, so if a wallet that can run on non-smart phones comes out it shouldn't be too alien. And everyone here owns a cellphone.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:56:13
I probably will, just checking to see If there are any alternatives.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:06:24
I don't really have anything I could sell, but a friend of mine does run a cafe - I'll try seeing if he's willing to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:34:08
They are as they're done via credit card not wire transfer. Only issue is Amazon doesn't deliver here(at least not when I last checked in 2011-12).
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll look into it tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:15:55
Not really, I could probably sell a couple of game codes I have, but that would probably only net me 3-10 dollars.
@_date: 2014-05-15 13:45:29
Yes, although they aren't as common as in the US.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:17:27
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:12:13
I'm not sure,
This might be the law in question  page 14 point 29 . (note; I'm just guessing, but it seems to fit.)
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:12:48
Thanks for the advice, I'll ask about the specifics tomorrow, from what I remember they told me that the state bank has disallowed transfers in between personal and business accounts, and that their banks had opposed it, but couldn't do anything.
Another bank employee at a different bank told me that it was the banks own policy.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:15:44
I'm not too sure but I think this is the law in question  Page 14, point 29
And we're interesting in changing, but corruption is everywhere, political killings are the norm, etc... But people are slowly waking up, thousands of people actually lined up for 9-10 hours to vote this past election, despite the threat of violence, bombings, etc...
@_date: 2014-05-15 12:34:26
Not really, almost no one owns bitcoin here, and I'm a student.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:37:16
No one really wants to, but it's the only route available. This time there was a new party calling for change, and an end to corruption,etc.. most of the middle class voted for it, and it ended up second. So that at least appears promising.
@_date: 2014-05-15 09:59:38
Well I'm in Karachi, so it isn't really safe to carry around a couple thousand dollars, the average annual salary's basically 1k a year, and sometimes muggers actually follow you from the bank or atm if they see you've withdrawn any significant amount.
As for the other options, I don't want to risk it, and the markup is pretty bad too.
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:11:13
As far as I'm aware the government hasn't even heard of Bitcoin so it should be legal. 
My main issue is that sure I can implement security measures, but I just don't feel safe carrying or having people know I have easy access to that kind of money.(2-3k). When I, and several other people I know, have been robbed at gunpoint for cheap cellphones and the like.(This isn't an everyday occurrence, but I know perhaps 5-6 people who've been mugged by a motorcycle rider with a gun sometime in the last 5-6 years.)
@_date: 2014-05-15 15:04:03
Pakistan's relatively free, the issue is it's also relatively corrupt, lawless, and incompetent. But I do intend to move abroad(as does almost everyone my age (at least those who are able to))  once I get my bachelors degree.
