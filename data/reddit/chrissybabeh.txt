Did you know 500 people say this everyday and its just pointless because they are 2 completely different working currencies?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:29:17
if you think £15k is the ceiling then theres no point of you being here
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:59:12

Most people  are here to aim high and see how far this technology will get us.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:52:07

i have no idea how people think bitcoin is better than fiat. How are you bashing fiat when bitcoin is fucking bipolar. I bought some btc to buy something later and boom drops to 7k. By next week it will probably be 3k and thats when i was gonna use it

Best bet would be local bitcoins but transaction fees + theres is just a nono imo. Id help you out but I've on got like 45% of what you're asking for
@_date: 2018-08-21 16:40:40
no its not its a way of keeping track of every single transaction 
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:52:41
no ur just dumb mate 
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:55:12
feel bad for people constantly dumping money in this dying dream. Bitcoin made crypto big thats all now its gonna be a while before it goes up again.
