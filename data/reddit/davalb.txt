Are they saying in the first sentence that the Berlin Wall fell in 1991?
@_date: 2016-08-25 08:55:05
They have changed the sentence since and took out the Berlin Wall part.
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:59:22
he doesn't imply that in any way.

Please consider, that the bitcoin community will be judged by how respectfully it treats it adversaries. Always be excellent! 
(Thought I had after reading the twitter conversation.)

I believe he might have had an account set up already, so it was accepted automatically. It could also show that he is indeed researching bitcoin.

This deserves a mention here: 
Liberty Music Store is a mp3 online shop written in python. It is still a bit difficult to set up, but the guy behind the project is looking for bands to use it and might help you out!

I think this is an excellent premise for a short story or novella.

What would be the alternative to a privately owned website? Would that be a website that is owned by a government? Or is there a third option?
@_date: 2016-01-10 13:25:09
Hey, your site looks really nice!
From the customer perspective one (maybe THE) major advantage in using bitcoin to purchase digital content is that it is faster because certain steps in the checkout process can be skipped. It is possible to create an onlineshop without obligatory registration and login for the customer. Why did you choose to make registration and login obligatory for you shop?

Freestate project in New Hampshire I think

That was refreshing!

If you by 'always' mean except in spring/autumn, I agree with you 100%.

Can you please tell me which testnet faucet you used? Thanks
@_date: 2016-12-20 20:33:43
good idea, you wouldn't have to buy the upper case and the numeral Schlagbuchstaben!

according to coinmarketcap we are still a billion off from the ATH market cap:

Do you have a source for OB1 dropping out of the NYA? Thank you.

Anybody has a link to ujo? Couldn't find anything

thank you!

cool, thank you!
@_date: 2015-08-09 12:11:58
Me, too!

Maybe not the best name for a distributed technology, because Ether is already the name of the Ethereum-token.

For Android: "Bitcoin Wallet" by Andreas Schildbach in my opinion
@_date: 2015-04-09 11:02:01
maybe the email addresses that got supposedly leaked from localbitcoins are from before last september...
@_date: 2015-04-13 11:53:04
I believe the classic Android Bitcoin Wallet  is not on the list
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:02:39
If you don't mind saying: when did you register?
@_date: 2015-09-14 12:06:24
Localbitcoins doesn't do business in Germany because of the legal situation here.

Do you sell those on Openbazaar as well?

Here is an old Louis CK video where he is telling basically the same joke: 
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:48:52
I believe the Schildbach wallet has a good fee estimation algorithm and I didn't experience any problems with too low fees, when I was last using it. Maybe can shed some light on this?
@_date: 2016-10-30 09:16:29
Very sensationalist title. This would be my TLDR: "the firm is not facing imminent risk of default but requires close monitoring"
@_date: 2015-11-05 09:17:02
The other hooded guy in the video, is he firing a gun at the end there?
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:55:40
wow, good find!

What is your source for "That's not even supposed to be on OpenStreetMap"? They seem to not have official contribution rules (which was the point of my post).

You can make a backup of the seed of your wallet. That covers you in case your HD is corrupted.

I frequently edit coinmap-entries in my region. There is one thing coinmap could improve: they should make a statement on their site, what qualifies a place to be accepted to coinmap.
Right now there are a dozen entries in my area like "Freelance graphic designer (can only be contacted through webpage - doesnt have a brick and mortar store)". This adds no value to coinmap imho, but I dare not remove it, as long as coinmap doesn't publish criteria for acceptance.

Edeka is the biggest grocery firm in Germany but it is only this one online-store that is accepting bitcoin, not the whole chain.

Thumbs up for checking it out. I clicked on one of the ads to say thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:30:33
Thanks for this hint. I couldn't find their email address and I assumed that support was only for paying customers, that is why I posted here instead. I will look for an email address again.
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:45:02
Could this have something to do with Winkdex beeing down? Maybe they are relying on them for the exchange rate?
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:13:30
I sent them a support ticket and they did answer immediately. Problem is not yet resolved, but I believe we will get there eventually.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:18:32
No, it is free regardless. Here is their pricing info:

Germany didn't actively ban localbitcoins.com. It is just that the legal situation is so unclear, that localbitcoins' attorneys advised the company to no longer service this market.
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:28:25
A thread on BTCtalk is better than nothing I guess, but I think the site would be improved, if it were on the site itself.

7: He is the real Satoshi and his anonymity became threatend. He came out with faked proof that he is Satoshi. After the fake is discovered, everybody thinks he is a pretender and he can safely disappear in obscurity once again :)

I believe that you need a ground station to connect to the satellite constellation. I am not sure if you can build that into a car?
