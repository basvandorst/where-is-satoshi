This is a key consideration:

Yup yup, gotta get a receipt if you want it to be tax deductible, and that's typically done via email if it's an online transaction. On our form (I work at a nonprofit that accepts donations in BTC) you can opt out of filling in the details, but your donation will NOT be tax deductible if you do.
Also true that it can be nice to send follow-up thank you notes and such to donors, and maybe even important milestones of success that donors helped make happen.

Did you read the article? The point wasn't that it's a pancea, but that open protocols can enable services that reach these folks. Nobody's saying that literally just the existence of Bitcoin itself is the answer.

It's possible you didn't realize it, OP, but this book promotes really harmful ideas about women. You're free to read whatever you like of course, but posting it in is really not going to help make this a welcoming place for women.

Yeah, it's similar to that. Kind of like publicly owned infrastructure for a global economy. It isn't really competitive with Bitcoin, like you say - it's just a way that the whole world can be interoperable, *including* Bitcoin.

This is really cool. Thanks for the step-by-step walkthrough!

"The lack of women in Bitcoin isn't just an issue of equality. It's a fundamental weakness of the currency itself."
This ten thousand times over. A community/technology that hopes to take off must include everyone, especially a demographic that is half the population.
As a woman in Bitcoin, I've been hit on egregiously at meetups, put up with sexist nonsense in digital currency forums, and generally feel out of place in a world so clearly shaped by men.
I'm not saying this from a place of hate or bitterness, but from a desire to better the community. Let's be careful about the messages we're sending to women.

Exactly. There's a huge market for SMS-based services, especially in relation to financial inclusion.

Eva from Stellar here. just confirming that we don't see Bitcoin as competition; we actually think it's complementary. The network is currency agnostic, so there's no reason why BTC couldn't operate on the network.

Here's hoping they really do refund you!

SMS is actually still incredibly common in much of the world.

The developing world.

This is a joke though, right?

Girls Gone Bitcoin was one of the very first BTC marketplaces. It's quite clearly a NSFW subreddit, so there should be no surprises for newbies.
Why censor one of the earliest players in the ecosystem?
The women there 1. choose to be there 2. find it lucrative and/or entertaining and 3. gave a great demonstration of a real-world application of BTC before it was more mainstream.
