Roger offered $200,000, and seems still open for negotiations.  OKCoin could have got out by paying $20,000 first then seek to transfer the contract to someone else.  $10k might sound like a big price tag, but many companies spend far more than this on SEM per month (well, when bitcoins were hot).

In OKCoin's history, they never paid.  The top prize for the Futures Trading Competition Oct - Dec 2014 was pre-arranged to be paid to a Chinese guy.  They set this guy to 0 trading commissions on Futures, whereas everyone else had commissions.
Say someone cracks SHA-256 and proves it, OKCoin will give the evidence to another guy, say their own employee, and have that guy submit it again and claim the prize.  It's been done over and over again at OKCoin.

Can you make the same Oath that OKCoin does not have bots controlled by OKCoin (or your employees) running on your exchange?
I think a lot of people will want to see that confirmation!

I believe the Google Translate Lawyer "Li Yajun &lt;yajun.li does not exist.  OKCoin does not have in house counsel.  The materials coming out of that person sounds suspiciously similar to way Star would talk.  I think Star made up a lawyer before he made up the fake document.  Let's see some proof to the contrary.  Lawyers usually don't mind to show themselves publicly.

Just make sure you get paid in advance, if you are ever contracted to do advertising for OKCoin.

No need to worry, plenty of other threads to post for this topic it seems.  It's not the first time OKCoin posts then deletes its own threads and comments.

He probably mis-typed "colleague", but because he recently typed collage, the auto-correct set it to "collage".

The reason for CZ's (and the rest of the team's) resignation is a very good point.  One logical explanation is they spotted things they don't want to be associated with, which finally make sense now.
