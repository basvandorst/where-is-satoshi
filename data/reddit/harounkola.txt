I think its the regulation issue.

I'm loving the chaos at the moment.

What a happy story. Congratulations for having the courage to invest at such an early stage. You could also try speculating on the price action of bitcoin against the fiat dollar, and using some of the leveraged platforms now available like BitFinance and others coming, coin it in as an income source with a relatively small BTC account size...

Stellenbosch seems to be really cooking with Bitx and Switchless' announcement.

I'm new to reddit. What does it take to have a subreddit? I'd love to speculate on BTCUSD and I think many people are opening up. I've been spending the last week promoting a BTC autotrading robot as an affiliate so I know that such events are going to stimulate immense interest.
And a few brokers are starting to offer BTCUSD and other pairs too. It's going to be commonplace soon.

Are you enjoying it?

My pleasure

How profitable will it be to mine then?

With kipochi.com, though I haven't withdrawn to M-Pesa as yet here in South Africa, it has the potential to give BitCoin mass adoption.

Thanks you.

Well I think it takes courage to venture into a high risk endeavor and be a pioneer in the wealth that's being created for us all.

They were looking for developers recently. I guess they filled their staffing requirements.
