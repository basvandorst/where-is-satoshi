So how can I start using it? Since I've been planning to make myself a paper wallet, will I need to do anything to use segwit?

Can't a USB fail? should I go like u/StudentBill recommended, and use a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:46:07
So does that mean segwit is a fork which we should adopt, or software over the top of BTC which needs to be used more?

Ok, great. So sounds like a paper wallet is very safe.  
How can I view/check that funds have been sent to it? Also, how do you recommend I access the funds with my private key once I need to?

Think I'll setup a paper wallet. Is [this]( site a safe way to do so?

Ok, so essentially everytime I move the Bitcoin, I print out a new paper wallet, and check the funds using a Bitcoin block explorer (however ill most likely leave it to sit). Does green address allow me to enter a private and public key to access my coin?

If my coins are stored on Green address, are they safe? Could green address be hacked?

So are funds stored on green address segwit?

~~That's what I'm looking for - I want to know the difference in the tech behind each currency, irrelevant of price. However most people I talk to IRL just talk about price.~~
EDIT: replied to the wrong comment, I'm an idiot

So it the blocksize is that big of a problem, why didn't BTC just increase its size? Why didn't people just decided on the best option, instead of splitting into two coins (which sounds a bit stupid to me)

When do we expect it to go back up? I'll obviously buy right before then
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:47:50
I think I'll do the same... Although the company I usually buy though isn't updating their prices
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:07:26
Don't worry op, I bought my first Bitcoin last Monday, when it was 9900AUD (now 7900Aud)

-dont store keys on computer. 
   
Does this mean using something like green address is bad? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:37:07
I've been considering that, but what if something happened to the hardware wallet? I'm not sure if I want to trust all my money on a piece of hardware that could ultimately fail.
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:05:18
so what, people in support of BCH rose the value of their currency before dumping? is that all that happened?
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:38:12
So what solution do core Devs have? Surely they aren't not increasing block size without first having a better solution...

This may be the best one liner I've ever heard
