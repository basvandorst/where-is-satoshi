Well yeah but can’t they just make it illegal to take bitcoin as a form of payment? I think that would be enough to keep the mainstream out of it.

I mean I hope for the best as I’m invested too, but do you guys really think that Bitcoin is gonna be successful in 2020? I think we all know some sort of adjustment is in order. After that though, is there evidence that the government isn’t gonna shut our party down once it really gets going?

He lost nothing.

Now this hasn’t happened to me. But I have heard of this happening to others and it is just fraud protection. Should be a one time thing. Someone else probably knows better so I hope they correct me! Don’t fret!

TAKE ALL OF THIS WITH A HUGE GRAIN OF SALT.
I am new as well. I am just making this to give you an explanation that would have helped me out in the beginning. There are many more experienced people out there that can give you more advice. Here is what has worked for me so far:
Coinbase: (exchange where you can keep your money on) Use as your main means of exchange for Bitcoin. It’s simple and it has mobile apps as well as being one of the most trusted ones. Also being connected to GDAX which is a great tool and easy transfers between the two for more complex trading. However, it does tend to freeze as the enormous amount of newcomers make transactions with these recent movements (I personally think that it will adjust). Remember, when your Coins are in Coinbase they are not in your hands. You’re just letting Coinbase hold them while you tell Coinbase what to do with them (therefore if they want to freeze them/seize them or anything they could whether it was legal or not as you don’t actually control them!). Also exchanges can get hacked. 
Therefore you need a place to keep your Coins so that they are safely in your hands and you control them.
Electrum: (desktop wallet) for moving any larger amounts of Bitcoin off exchange (in my case Coinbase) into a wallet. It’s simple as well and is a trusted wallet. Allows you to have your coins in your own hands and safe without having to download the entire blockchain. Also the seed they give you allows you to recover that wallet if that computer gets destroyed.
I researched and found that if you’re investing very small amounts like me then these two work. If you are investing any significant amount then getting a hardware wallet like Trezor is the way to go (I don’t even invest enough to have a Trezor pay off).

Not all at once, slowly is key

I was just looking to invest in Bitcoin perhaps long term and then sell at a higher price!

Interesting, how come?

make sure that you are on coinbase and not coimbase because then you are getting phished Edit: Although I am gonna assume that was just a quick typo
