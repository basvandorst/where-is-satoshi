I have also emailed them, but they have yet to give me a response. Could you link me to the other thread?

Yes, I checked that and there was only the purchases listed. The issue is now fixed so I am no longer concerned.

So there will still be miners except this time, they will be paid out of a slight tax on the transactions they process?

Hi Fred, your response is reassuring, but my coins are still missing and it has been over a week. I have emailed you guys twice with no response. Is there anything I can do to expedite the process of getting my coins to appear in my account again?

Yeah, I browsed around and found that seems to be the issue. My balance is now displaying correctly.

This is something that happens to all reddit communities after they grow large enough. Because the reddit algorithm weights upvotes more heavily based on the speed they are given, all subreddits inevitably turn to meme-based circlejerks after a certain point. 
The way to prevent this is by the community deciding that it wants interesting, insightful commentary and electing moderators who will rigorously enforce such standards. has done a good job with this. Hopefully, the mods will address this issue sooner rather than later and we can to the insightful, discussion-based subreddit it once was.

I have looked under transactions as well and there appears to be no recorded outbound activity.

I didn't do that, but they were able to fix the problem. Thank you for the advice anyway.
