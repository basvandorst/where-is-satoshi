Thanks, I didn't know about put.io. They have UI and I can stream it to my Roku.

It is cool, but it should be a way to recognize an user, not a key to enter. A password is necessary

I read that part and I know that you can't sell the project. What I meant was that try to talk with big companies about it and offer your technical support. Really big companies could be interested in this kind of internal voting system. Good luck!

Add "blockchain!" and you'll get you blockexplorer

Do not forget you can be located by your IP.

No, not another fat joke. The guy isn't that fat.

So you only have one type of mead. You only allow a minimum of 2 bottles (about $20 each). No reviews, no descriptions. No pictures.
Sorry, but I think that the lack of orders in bitcoins is not your main issue.

They have been using Bitcoin since January. According to their [blog](
~~Is the seller who can choose between PayPal, Dwolla, and Bitcoin.~~
EDIT: Fiverr accepts Bitcoin, but withdraws can only be done in USD.
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:45:33
Oh, Dwolla, you missed that.
@_date: 2014-11-07 22:26:20
I was not talking about the buyer, but the seller. Police will go after the seller and his/her IP can be seen in OB. From [OpenBazaar's blog](


I hope they will change the way you "ID" is tied to your contracts, but from now on, do not use OB for illegal activities.

add "qr!" after the address
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:52:08
I've read the whole paper. A few observations:
* The basic ideas are nice, but the implementations of them is the difficult part. A long way to get there.
* The paper is difficult to understand. It is not very well organized and sometimes is confusing. I guess it wasn't proofread.
* You are not replacing the Bitcoin Foundation, you are giving them a platform to democratize its decisions. You have made a decentralized Reddit.
* My bet is that you won't get the bounty, but if developed, it might be a useful tool for other organizations. Do not give up and try to sell the idea to big companies.

That's it. I2P is better suited for OB than Freenet or Tor.

It creates one new address for every transaction. The balance can be seen in the main screen, but not in the one with the QR you hand to the customer.
I'm not familiar with other wallets that handle HD, but you can look around to see if any of them fit your requirements.
Good luck and keep us posted!

What bugs? 
@_date: 2015-05-16 19:53:15
I guess it shouldn't be very difficult to create an app for Mycelium Gear.

I'm not a native English speaker, so that can help me to find the paper difficult to read. But in any case, the concepts should be clear and the titles of each section more...according to the content.

Maybe you can add a watch-only xpub key or create a HD wallet, delete it and keep it as a watch-only one in Mycelium.
@_date: 2015-05-16 19:49:38
According to its description, it has "150+ pricing currency options". Probably CAD is among them.

Actually they accept Bitcoin since the end of January. In Spanish 
@_date: 2015-03-12 00:05:29
Not really recent news. In Spanish 
@_date: 2015-02-17 17:21:35
I'd say Mycelium is the best Android wallet by far. Good job.
BTW, you commented that you were thinking about renew the UI, is that true? if so, when?

I didn't think so, but it's the only thing they've changed recently. Although they are migrating their servers.
Good luck.

Where can I find the page where the discussion of Wikimedia accepting BTC is taken place? I'd like to know the reasons.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:44:36
I like Dwolla, but I see why you don't. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-07-11 17:47:14
Sorry, I checked [the order and shipment]( policy and I thought that if it's in English and they use DHL, international shipments were possible.

You are right. MtGox said there is no ETA.
It is said that LTC will be accepted in the next weeks. But it could be months.

I've read that just to add the button is a pain, but from my point of view, it couldn't hurt your shop.

Could it be related to [this](
 "IMPT: Starting Jul 15 all bitcoin deposit addresses will be disposable. Please generate a new address every time you need to make a deposit."
Maybe they changed the way the deposits and withdraws are done.

MtGox moves seven times more volume than Btc-e does.
Three out of the four biggest markets do not trade with other than Bitcoin.

A couple years ago I heard about Bitcoin. I knew it was a currency so I went to Wolfram Alpha (through DuckDuckGo) and I typed "1 bitcoin in dollars". I didn't get any result related with bitcoin and I thought it was not a real currency and I forgot about it.
Thanks for the good news!
