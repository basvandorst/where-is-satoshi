Thanks for following up, makes a lot more sense now. Please don't take my intense skepticism as negativity; I'd love - *love* - a debit card style Bitcoin solution. I just know a project like that would be incredibly difficult for a large, well-funded team to achieve, let alone a small startup.
I do think the concept of using a server-side wallet for temporary, pass-through storage only is a great idea. Simultaneously takes a lot of burden off the service provider, and provides additional security for the users. Keep us updated!

Was just thinking that. Could we get some of those cool Subreddit features here? It would be cool to be able to attach a Bitcoin address to a username, like they attach credentials at [AskScience]( and the sidebar should definitely have more data about popular Bitcoin exchanges.

Thanks, I'll do that. My main issue so far is figuring out the best way to run bitcoind. Releasing an app that's literally nothing more than a GUI that makes JSON-RPC calls would be a step up, but isn't as user friendly as I'd like an app to be. Ideally, I'd just bundle bitcoind within the client and start/kill it automatically behind the scenes, but I don't do desktop app dev and the tools I've been trying (Appcelerator has been best so far) don't seem to have an obvious way to do this. I'll see what I can pull together.

The more I think and read about it, the more I'm realizing that this wallet concept - or at least, the way it's explained and executed - is a massive, massive failure. I need to do some more research before saying more, but in short: it's uncomfortably user-unfriendly and fragile for such a fundamental part of this whole system.
@_date: 2011-06-05 01:10:41
This is a dangerous point-of-view. The entire bitcoin ecosystem is ugly, confusing, and deeply unusable. Really think about the questions posed in the article. The client works, as in, it creates a functional front-end for some bitcoin-related tasks, but it isn't at all designed for how humans would want to interact with the currency.
The point of the article isn't that the client is hard, it's that the client works pretty well for obsessive nerds (present company included), but if bitcoin is really going to succeed at the goals it sets out to accomplish, it needs to not only be usable by normal people, it needs to be exceptional. If you think it's reasonably usable, you're welcome to that opinion, but please understand that you're the exact sort of person Mr. Falkvinge was referring to. Great with complex logic, terrible at friendly front-end.
@_date: 2011-06-08 17:26:04
100% agree. Decentralization at the core is wonderful, but there needs to be optional centralization for the sake of ease of use. The concept of the "trusted node" has come up a few times, which would allow a site like MtGox to establish relationships with these known third-parties and use them exclusively for transaction verification. For an additional fee, you could have a transaction validate "immediately" through these trusted nodes. There would be a stronger paper trail, so to speak, but for users who don't care it would be worth it.
(At least, as I understand it. If I'm incorrect, please correct me.)
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:21:23
"Besides, what's the point of BitCoin if you can't use it in everyday life?"
THIS. I totally understand that there's an inherent ease-of-use trade-off for more privacy and security, but the balance is way off right now. If bitcoin is going to succeed, it must become functional for the average person, and at least as easy to use as existing currency.

So, someone on a Kickstarter knock-off site, with no credentials or even a picture of their *actual face*, wants $5000 to:
- "[S]tor[e] your private key on a secure server", with no specifications as far as what "secure server" entails.
- "...will develop payment processing machines that can either be connected through their business computer (to interface with their software) or even directly to the internet..." which probably means an Arduino with a mag stripe reader.
No details on how the cards will actually be printed, or how the entire system will be secured, or any reason to believe this person (people?) has any previous experience with anything in the payment processing or retail field.
Yeah, no fucking chance I'm touching this with a 10-foot pole.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:45:34
I'm not 100% on this, but I believe I've read people suggesting the concept of trusted nodes - machines known to be objective, and incredibly powerful, that can be utilized to quickly confirm transactions. I imagine it being the Bitcoin equivalent of credit card processing fees. They'll pay a percentage of each transaction to validate the coins ASAP.
@_date: 2011-06-07 20:33:06
Could be! Again, it just one of those little quirks that adds to the pile of annoying things to deal with.

There is a significant difference between the Bitcoin protocol, and the applications and services that utilize it. The protocol can be static, but specific features can be emphasized or deemphasized for the sake of improved user experience. Those apps and services are the ecosystem.

True, hashes provide anonymity, but there is a significant cost: usability. Bitcoin's success relies on expansion and adaptation, and that's going to require ease-of-use improvements like simpler ways to move bitcoins around. The fact that the system is built around anonymizing transactions is a wonderful thing, and one of the biggest benefits of the system, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be an option available for less anonymity and easier use. Username+salt is significantly easier to remember than a hash, but still clunky. Ideally, the entire address layer should be invisible to the user.
Like I said above, MtGox isn't an acceptable solution. It requires the creation of a brand new account (Dwolla) and at least a week or more before the user is able to do anything. I need to be able to use systems I already use (bank account, credit/debit card) to purchase bitcoins immediately before I'll call it good. The average person won't accept anything less.
I keep hearing people defend the client UI as "simple", which is technically accurate but *not inherently a Good Thing*. You're using "simple" to mean "user-friendly", which it certainly is not. Complex interfaces can be incredibly user-friendly. To say "everyone knows how that works" is insane, and to call it elegant even more so.
When I received my first bitcoins, the new transaction was greyed out. Why? The client didn't tell me. I had to do some searching to learn that I had to wait for confirmations before the bitcoins were actually mine. What did that mean? More research. The real kicker: I didn't need to know how it worked, I just needed to know *why I didn't have my bitcoins already*. An elegant solution would have been to mark the transaction as "verifying" or something, with a Help topic or hover popup with friendly text explaining that the network needed more time to confirm the transaction. A time estimate or progress report would have been nice, too. To display nothing is the opposite of elegant.
Your last sentence says it all. It's not even close to ready for non-geeks, and it certainly is technically sound, but that's the problem I'm trying to shed light on! I fully agree that it's technically sound, but it's a pain in the fucking ass to use, and we need to fix that pronto if Bitcoin is going to succeed.
@_date: 2011-06-09 14:20:52
I am certainly not flamebaiting, and I never said the "my_mom" interface needs to be one button or anything of the sort. I specifically included the fact that complex interfaces can be usable. My point is that the Bitcoin client interface, the copy used, and the overall Bitcoin experience is incredibly difficult and unfriendly, and that should probably be improved as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2011-06-06 13:07:49
They are single use, as in:
1. You have a plastic card with ฿5 on it.
2. You spend ฿5.
3. Your card is now trash.
I don't know about you, but I have like 4-5 plastic cards in my wallet, and even that is annoying. I can't imagine trying to carry enough bitbills to make any kind of substantive purchase. It would take up a ridiculous amount of space. Bitbills are useful like gift cards, but aren't sustainable as a form of physical currency like a dollar bill or euro coin.
@_date: 2011-06-07 12:47:12
If you're interested in public perception, we should be raising funds to hire a marketing or design firm, or some user experience experts. The system simply is not fit for public consumption as is, and I just think passion like yours could be better focused elsewhere.

"There is no Bitcoin economy."
I was planning on writing up a whole thing about what Bitcoin needs to succeed (and still might), but for the most part, this guy is saying exactly what I planned to.
His point about decimal places is key. It is *incredibly user unfriendly* to require a payment of 0.00141, as he referenced. Imagine trying to verbalize that request! "Hey, could you send me point-zero-zero-one-four-one?" We need friendly nomenclature, stat. On the official bitcoin forum, I believe they settled on calling it a milli? "How much?" "Oh, just 2 milli." Much better, though it still takes a bit to get used to.
@_date: 2011-06-07 14:50:08
Ha! The circularity of your logic is paralyzing.
@_date: 2011-06-07 13:02:02
I was referring to [this bug]( which has since been sort-of fixed but [not really]( "So if you create a backup, do more than 100 things that cause a new key to be used, and then restore from the backup, some Bitcoins will be lost." Completely unacceptable.
I do agree that the UI is functional, but only in the most literal sense. It's certainly not *user friendly*. MtGox is an okay way to buy and sell currency for now, but it's not very easy. I haven't heard anyone way they had a good experience with Dwolla, and the general public isn't going to want to go through the hassle of creating a brand new account and waiting a week or more just to get some bitcoins. Until I can punch in a debit card and have coins in minutes, it's not good enough.
@_date: 2011-06-06 12:49:13
This is harsh. Right now, PayPal is the easiest gateway to purchasing Bitcoins. Heck, that's how I got started. Dwolla works, but it's incredibly time-consuming to set up. In an economy like this one, the barriers to entry need to be as small as possible, and this development hurts.
Even if the goal of Bitcoin is anonymous transacting with no trusted third-party required, there's obviously an incredible need for some sort of reputation system. If we're going to keep a lid on fraud and theft, there has to be a mechanism in place to ensure that each party in a transaction is reliable, or we'll end up with situations like this with chargebacks galore and people disappearing after receiving large amounts of coins.
@_date: 2011-06-05 23:13:41
Wait, you can only withdraw $1000 worth of BTC, *in* BTC, per day? Or is it cashing out $1000/day max?

Not sure why this was voted down, I completely agree. In my experience, most PMs aren't technical and are mostly just obnoxious. The highly technical ones, however, are usually incredible. I'd take UI experts over PMs in this situation.
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:25:44


I was simplifying a bit, but (a) if you use more than 100 addresses between backups, your old backups are invalid as they won't contain the new private keys (you'll "run out" of matching addresses), and while bitcoins don't disappear, they definitely can become unusable when private keys are lost. A non-spendable bitcoin is as good as disappeared.


Absolutely, and I look forward to it. I'm just making it my goal to be that squeaky wheel that starts to get people thinking about making the UI/UX nicer.


It is not impossible, but it is significantly more complex than the threshold of a normal user will allow for. Too difficult to scale, for sure.


Yes. Every time I want to offer my info to someone, I have to make a relatively significant effort vs. recalling a name from memory. Not to mention, there is a world out there that involves talking to people. It would be nice if Bitcoin took human beings in to consideration when developing the interaction schema. I can paste my address to you, but I can't tell it to you.
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:07:57
Not sure that's true. Kickstarter started April '09 (according to their Wikipedia article) but Invested.in started around March '10, according to VentureBeat ( the earliest link I can find). Even if they were in development for an entire year before launch, well, execution is everything. Kickstarter clearly has a more effective platform and a stronger community, regardless of who started dev when.
In the interest of fairness, I'm curious to learn more about these additional features and flexibility, and how those make it superior. As far as my personal experience has gone, Kickstarter pretty much has the concept nailed down.

How depressing. Isn't bitcoin supposed to help overcome this sort of regulatory monitoring, ideally?
@_date: 2011-06-07 03:13:14
This is so very far down the list of things that must be demanded of the Bitcoin ecosystem. For starters:
- A client that won't run out of addresses and disappear untold amounts of bitcoins.
- A client with a UI that doesn't confuse just about everyone who tries to use it.
- A simple, legal way to exchange bitcoin for USD, JPY, EUR, etc.
- A way to send/receive bitcoins that doesn't require the user to know or share a hash. (Usernames with single-use salts? ex. 54mf.060711eff)
This is putting the cart before dozens of horses. A lobbying org could potentially be useful down the road, but unless fundamental improvements aren't made, we'll never get there. Raise money for those first.
@_date: 2011-06-08 02:31:11
You're mostly right, we do need third parties to pick up the slack. However, it's important to distinguish between the GUI client and the bitcoin protocol. The client operates in a rather unfriendly way, that can and should be fixed without adjusting the protocol itself. Also, I may be mistaken but I'm not entirely sure the concept of returning "change" back to the user as a second transaction after a send attempt is part of the protocol. If not, the main client should avoid acting unilaterally to make such impactful decisions without offering an option to the user.
I'm sleepy, sorry for the short reply. I might also be a bit wrong. Will revisit in the morning.
@_date: 2011-06-20 11:55:29
I don't believe this for a second (to quote ArcticCelt, why the fuck does the financial auditor have access to the password database?) but it seals the deal for me: I'm never using Mt. Gox again.

@_date: 2011-06-23 14:59:08
I'm considering putting a small laundering app together (just to test out the network and the API), and this is along the lines of what I had in mind. I'd like to see multiple wallets, potentially even on multiple machines in multiple countries, operated by a central operator. Coins coming in are never returned to the sender, are filtered through multiple exchanges or returned to other laundry users, and the original sender receives multiple transactions of randomized amounts and at randomized times, at a brand new address, from an address under an account in a wallet on a completely different machine and country.
In this case, any law enforcement attempts at seeding would see coins moving in to the pool, then distributing to exchanges or being sent in random amounts to new addresses, some of which are laundry users and others that are part of the pool. Addresses wouldn't be used more than once, ideally. Coins in, coins spent, address retired.
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:51:07
It's completely insane that MtGox wasn't using stronger encryption for passwords, or multi-step authentication, or that they gave their entire goddamn password database to a "financial auditor". Yes, it is also the fault of the users who didn't use secure passwords or throwaway email accounts, but MtGox had a responsibility to treat their users with an appropriate level of respect considering the investments made.
Like I said in another thread, I'm done with them. "Too little, too late" is an understatement.
@_date: 2011-06-07 17:35:09
Yes, as long as they play nice with the network.
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:26:14
Really? Can you imagine walking in to, say, Target, and whipping out a giant stack of single-use plastic cards to pay for your stuff? What if you don't have the exact amount and need change? Do they give you cards back?
@_date: 2011-06-23 17:03:31
MD5 + salt is better than MD5, sure, but they really should have gone beyond that considering they were, theoretically, a financial exchange. Multiple rounds of hashing, a stronger encryption algorithm, salts stored separately from passwords, a static global salt (which is never, ever shared, ever) along with individual password salts, bcrypt, any would have made cracking significantly more difficult.

I'm pretty sure this is aimed at my post from earlier today. Not sure why you didn't just leave this there, but, okay.
I would highly recommend you read up on the California Gold Rush. They didn't "introduce a viable and superior currency", gold had backed the USD since the 1700s. Most prospectors went home with nothing. I don't have the foggiest idea why you think people were trading sheep before the gold rush.
If your TL;DR is "shut up and keep mining", you're part of the problem.

Yeah, I'm fine with taxation (although I'm more a fan of a flat tax system, but that's a whole other discussion). The concept of bitcoin as purely a vehicle for laundering and drug buying is totally invalid, though. Like you said, USD is just the same.

Can't reply for huanix, but I'm also in the "yes" camp, simply because I believe that the freedom to exchange goods and services with other human beings in whatever manner one chooses is an inherent right (as much as any right can be "inherent"). If I have a widget, and someone else has bitcoins, and I believe bitcoins to hold worth sufficient for exchange for my widget, it is no one else's right to prevent that exchange. Replace "bitcoins" with dollars, euros, gold bricks, shiny rocks, whatever. If the government decides I'm not *allowed* to use bitcoins, well, they're kind of acting outside the realm of their control.
(Side note: governments have the right to prevent counterfeit money from being created and circulated, as a matter of fraud prevention. Bitcoin is an alternative to USD, not an imitation.)

Excellent post. Personally, as long as there's a way for me to spend Bitcoins on goods and services, I'll be using it.
