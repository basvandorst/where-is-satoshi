I hope all the hardware we have will get destroyed at the same time that happens.

Can't buy bitcoin if nobody's mining it :)

You have to pay income tax on BTC you hold less then a year in Germany. You are correct that you don't have to pay income tax in case you hold your BTC position for longer than a year.

A satoshi is the smallest monetary unit in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and is named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the—probably pseudonymous—developer(s) of Bitcoin.

I think he meant: "I can send you a dollar of bitcoin, cash." I hope at least.

I think such company would have checked with the German state, if it makes sense for them to open up an exchange.
Also the official ability to trade crypto with a banking licence speaks for the state not being against crypto... yet.

Seems to be a new one in Berlin. The other one is/was the Room 77 one. It closed do to operators needing a banking license for ATMs in Germany. I'd guess without one, the new one will close soon also. Any articles about German bitcoin ATMs and their legality?

Then I guess let me say: 
"If you take the risk, you have the right to receive the rewards"? 
I don't know what else it would ever mean. His statement made sense, even if he said it viciously.

If you take the risk to receive it's rewards... That's kinda exactly what "deserves" means.

People often forget that since exchanges are centralised, we'll always hear about their stolen or burnt coins. 
On the other hand we have a mass of people that had their coins stolen from their own wallets. There won't be to much news about that.
I'd like to see a risk analysis of owning your own keys and having your BTC stored on a exchange. 
I'm not advocating to have your BTC on an exchange tho.

You are saying: He doesn't deserve gains only because he takes the risk, the programmers should. I'm saying that's bs. Isn't that what you commented?
