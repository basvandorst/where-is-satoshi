Thanks for being proactive about it.
IN MORE IMPORTANT NEWS: Please, tell me how I can install Google Ultron. I've heard it's used by NASA &amp; powered by Adobe.

This looks like it could be a fun idle game!
***Question:*** I still don't really understand what the enhancements do though... You explain it as "Enhancement A costs CPU-Power to "build" on your Wallet, Enhancement B costs GPU-Power. " So does that mean that building enhancements will improve my mining capabilities? IE Does it give me more GPU/CPU power to mine after the enhancements have been completed?
***An idea:*** This might be a bit big of a task for you right now, but it could be really fun to become a 'day trader' after a while wherein you can trade the mined coins you get based on real life current values of the coins. 
***My only critique:*** there is no real story or point to the game apart from mining atm, which may make the game boring for some after a few minutes.
Good luck - I wish you all the best.
