I used to fold dollar bills into hearts or little t-shirts before putting them in the collection plate at church

Why not talk about bitcoin shortcomings on the bitcoin subreddit? I'd rather good, quality discussion than a circle jerk

Just use Gemini

It's either posts talking about the price or posts shitting on the posts talking about the price.
Post the things you want to see. Be the change.

Beautiful compared to coinbase.
I think my thousand dollar market buy had a $2.25 fee.

With gdax you can place small limit buys for free (you can set the limit a flat below actual price) and you can transfer it off gdax for free too.
Also lightning network will help when that is fully implemented

Ahhh I see

I know you're being sarcastic but is JT involved in Bitcoin?

My tactic for the last six months is a monthly DCA and a certain amount set aside for dips

I would try to contact them. I haven't heard about it taking more than 8 days in a long time

If you're just starting out, I recommend dollar cost averaging in and not trying to buy the DIPS.
Just buy weekly or monthly at market price

People in the crypto space should combat Bitcoin Cash and Coinbase's practices by using Gemini or other on-ramps (that don't list Bitcoin Cash) besides Coinbase and promoting these other sites with friends and family.
You vote on these issues by putting your money and promoting the money in your realm of influence on these other exchanges
