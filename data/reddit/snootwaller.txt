In my experience open source products often contain ridiculous security problems even though they have allegedly been reviewed by thousands of eyeballs. A certain very popular e-commerce package had such a ridiculous security hole, you could basically access the admin area if you set the password equal to null.  (The javascript on the access form prevented that, so turn javascript off and you're in-like-Flynn.)  The bug existed for 100+ updates and was only spotted when people started to exploit it widely.
This varies from project to project however, there are also open source products that are nearly impeccable. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:15:35
No, it's not nonsense, it's a natural byproduct of how open-source works. Some projects are created by people with little expertise to begin with, and the people who take up the project aren't any better. That's how absurd security problems like the one I described can survive for so long.
I'm sure you have in mind excellent open-source projects, and there are many well known examples of those.  Off the top of my head: bind, apache, snort, openSSL, these are all very solid products that I would take to the bank.  But for every excellent open source product, there are a thousand bad ones.  Maybe they aren't names you'd recognize, but they are more numerous than the good products by far. I wouldn't call shoddy open-source "far and away the exception".

You are very hard on types 1, 2, and 3 but they comprise 99%+ of internet users.
If you really want Bitcoin to be popular in the public eye, you better not expect the end user to know the meaning of terms like "security dongle", 2FA, multisig, and paper wallets. (And linux? What on earth is linux?)
Maybe they can use those things, just like every web surfer uses SSL all the time, but it better be completely invisible to them. Because they don't understand it, and they don't care.
And by the way, "hunter1" is a fairly difficult password to crack in the grand scheme of things. I see users make passwords all day long, and they are childish. You'll never get people to come up with high-entropy passwords. They don't do it.

No, it's not. Only gold is has the properties of gold, silver is valuable too but it has different properties. The are altcoins which have all of the properties of bitcoins. 
If one day, somehow, there was no gold on the planet, we would have to do without gold. If one day, some how, all of the bitcoins were lost, it would be no loss at all. We'd just make more.

I don't understand what you are asking. Are you lumping all "free country's national currency" into the same basket?
You do know what "liquid" means, right? Something is liquid if it can be exchanged easily for currency. So discussing the liquidity of currency only makes sense in the forex market, like exchanging euros for dollars, or dogecoin for renminbi.

It's also worth noting that there are many bogus fixes for race conditions that don't really fix anything, they just appear to fix it while they really push the race condition to a different part of the software. Nothing that an educated programmer would ever do, but you'll find these techniques in the wild all over the place. If you ever see software that sleeps for a random number of milliseconds, run for the hills.

It's not the new standard, it's the old standard that never went away.  Have you ever laid eyes on a plaintext list of passwords?  Believe me, if you selected 20 plaintext passwords at random you'd find that "hunter1" is not one of the easier ones to crack.  
I've seen passwords to very sensitive material being the name of some ex-girlfriend.  I've seen a password to a bank account containing over 100K being simple "money".  
Frightfully easy passwords are common practice.  Maybe you're right, people are retarded.  And on it goes.  Bitcoin won't change that.

I don't regard the number of adopters or the size of the blockchain as a property of the technology itself, nor should you. You're falling down the same slippery slope that makes goldbugs say "gold is valuable because everybody knows it's valuable."


Oh come on now. I never said that there are no altcoins with different properties, I said there are altcoins with identical properties.
And you didn't address my main point: "If one day, somehow, all of the bitcoins were lost, it would be no loss at all. We'd just make more." 
Perhaps because it's incontrovertible. When stated that way, the distinction between a real commodity like gold and a network application like cryptocurrencies becomes obvious.
I'm not saying cryptocurrency is bad because it isn't gold, and I'm not saying gold is bad because it isn't cryptocurrency, I'm saying that there are fundamental differences between the two.  When you explore those difference you start to appreciate what the word "commodity" really means.

You're 15, so you've seen your share of fads. Things that everybody thought would last forever, that are now so "yesterday". Imagine if you were your parents age (35-45?). They have seen so many more fads than you, they have become jaded. All their lives they've been told that such-and-such will be the next big thing, and 99% of the time it didn't pan out.
I'm not saying they're right and you're wrong, or vice versa, but when you look at it from their perspective they only have your well being at heart.
Having said that, if it's your money that you worked for, a good parent would let you do what you want with it.  They may express their concerns if they think you're making a mistake, but in the end, it's *your* money. If you work for your money and then they prohibit you from spending it, why would you even be motivated to work for it?
Unless your family is destitute, I have to assume the whole point in having you earn money is so you learn valuable life lessons. Losing money is part of that, too.  So in the worst case scenario your parents have helped you learn a valuable lesson.

I don't know how you want to define terms like "popular" or "well maintained." The commerce package I described (I might as well name it, it's OScommerce) is used on well over ~~10,000~~ 100,000 commerce sites today (it was twice that a few years ago) and has a member base of 200,000+ people. Is that popular?  Because it's a total piece of shit.
I think the culprit in many cases (certainly OScommerce's case) is that it attracts people with just enough technical expertise to hang themselves. The fact that it's written in PHP doesn't help; that's a favorite language of self-taught hacks. In my case I suggested a very important code change, which would eliminate an obvious race condition that must have been programmed by somebody inexperienced. I soon found myself talking to people who don't know what the term 'race condition' even means, but they had power in numbers, and declared "there are no bug reports submitted for this module so until you can replicate a problem no changes are warranted."  And so, childishly bad code would go uncorrected, even when somebody points out the a very specific problem and the solution.  
You've worked on open-source projects yourself, I presume?  You've never encountered anything like I described above?

Here's the bottom line.  There are two types of Bitcoin enthusiasts, and most people are a combination of these two types:
1. Pro-crypto, pro-cryptocurrency, anti-government controlled money, possibly semi anarcho-capitalist, hoping to improve mankind through technology.
2. Greedy people who invested some sum of money (or time, in the case of miners) into Bitcoin and want it to succeed for their own personal gain.
Dogecoin and type  is a marriage made in heaven.  First we had Bitcoin, now we have other cryptocurrencies that only improve upon Satoshi's original whitepaper.  The type  bitcoiners should be elated that dogecoin and others are coming to the forefront.
Dogecoin in anathema to type   They bought Bitcoin when it was $10 and now are looking at buying a house with their profits.  The last thing on earth they want to hear is that there are competing cryptocurrencies, especially one which might actually lower the value of their precious bitcoins.
So while the true cryptocurrency enthusiast have no problem with Dogecoin the get-rich-quick crowd fears it.
The fact that Dogecoin gets so incredibly downvoted here leads me to be convinced what I've suspected all along:  most people into Bitcoin are caught up in bubble-mania more than being true cryptocurrency enthusiasts.

Sometimes but not necessarily.  A long time ago we had chain letters that would say "Make 10 envelopes and mail $1 to each name on this list, then remove the top name and put yours at the bottom."  That's a classic ponzi scheme.  In principle, if you were in on it early and it went viral, you could rake in tens of thousands of dollars.  However, every dollar earned by one person is a dollar lost by another, and people trying to jump on bandwagon too late (i.e., 99% of the people who participated) will never see their $10 back.
I'm not saying Bitcoin fits this model but there are a few similarities:  anybody who has profited from Bitcoin either in US dollars or merchandise has benefited at the expense of other people who have invested into Bitcoin.  It's a zero sum game.  Bitcoin doesn't make money.  If one day there are Bitcoin billionaires flying around the globe, it can only be because other people lost money to them in the process.  There is no part of the equation that says "everybody can be rich."

I disagree with nearly every tenant that the OP presented. Although I do agree it's in a bubble but let's not get into that now.
My biggest complaint with cryptocurrency is that unlike gold, cryptocurrency has an infinite supply. I can hear some of you shrieking "No it doesn't, it's only 21 million!" But that's only Bitcoin. What about Peercoin, Litecoin, Namecoin, Novacoin, Buttcoin, Blipcoin, etc.? There is no limit to the amount of crypto we can flood the economy with, just like there is no limit to the fiat that floods the market.
So when you invest in bitcoin you are not investing in cryptocurrency, only bitcoin. Perhaps it's a smart investment: perhaps bitcoin will be the "dot com" to litecoin's "dot info." But it's not the no-brainer that most bitcoin enthusiasts make it sound like it is.
In fact I believe that many people here honestly don't want to see new competing cryptocurrencies even if they are technologically superior. This irrationally is because they are too heavily invested in bitcoin, so floating the idea of an improved version, of which they would own nothing, scares them. That's a surprising attitude from tech savvy people who usually kiss the old methods good riddance when better things come along.

And in every single case the currency eventually became worthless, or worth only its value as curio.
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:23:34


Very simple.  Something has intrinsic value if it is in fact valuable.  For example, if you are hungry, a bag of potatoes has intrinsic value.
Something has "value but not intrinsic value" if it is some sort of credit, like an IOU for a bag of potatoes.  You can't eat the IOU itself, but if it truly is redeemable for a bag of potatoes, it should theoretically be worth just as much.
When you own a gold coin, it is not a promise to deliver something valuable to you at some future date.  It *is* that valuable thing.

The classic "guru" scam works like this: email 80,000 suckers with (say) basketball predictions. Each person gets 3 predictions picked at random.
Now 1/8 of your suckers will of course see you get 3 for 3 and be amazed. Those are your 10,000 hottest leads. But what of the other 70,000?
Well, 30,000 of them will see you get exactly 2 out of 3 right--which proves you're not infallible but it's certainly good enough to pull a profit!
So in the end you can go back to half of your recipients claiming success even though you went out on a limb with three predictions. It seems to some that the odds of getting 2/3 right (or better) should be less than 50% but it's not.

The volume on the charts tells the whole story.  Very few people sold (or bought) btc yesterday.  If all you look at is the price it was surely a wild ride, but taking volume into account it was a meaningless blip.

After a bubble bursts (which I don't believe we are witnessing-–yet) there is usually a phase where the price rebounds sharply and sentiment swing positive again. That's when people say things like "Time to buy Yahoo now at $150--huge discount off the $300 it was at just last week!" And sure enough they re-inflate the market, but then it runs out of steam, and it starts to fall again even worse than the first perceived crash. That's the fifth leg of the Elliott wave, the most painful downturn. That's the "bull trap" because the true bulls who are "in it for the long run" added to their position at a price that's very high (even though it seemed relatively low.)

It seems most of you are completely baffled at the concept of intrinsic value.  Let's see if we can break this down for you:
Gold used to be money.  It was used for jewelry and other purposes, but primarily it was money.  Today it is not money in any nation, and yet it's still valuable.  People mine it out of the ground at great expense, central banks hoard it by the ton.  In spite of it not being money any more, it retains its value.
Today, Bitcoin is money.  That's all it is and all it can ever be. It lives and dies as money.  If one day it is not money, it will be worthless.
See the difference now?

Not a crash. Most people look at the price candles and ignore the volume. Notice that as much as the price moved, it did so on very little volume.  For this to be a real crash we need to see such spectacular volume that it outshines all of the volume that inflated the bubble *combined* ... When that day comes we'll see the real crash.

That's why I asked you how many currencies exist in your world--I can't imagine you saying anything other than "millions" without being inconsistent.
I am not the one making outlandish claims here. I will be the first to insist that bitcoin is a currency, as is the US dollar and the Renminbi. This is not a kooky notion. I don't think that gold itself is a currency, much less fake WoW gold. You however have an exapanded defition of "currency" which is quite bizarre and unconventional.

I was just quoting Keynes, but if you must ask what he meant by the quote, I believe the context was that he was attempting to profit off what he believed to be a speculative bubble, by short selling a series of highly leveraged trades. He ended up being vindicated, when the speculative bubble crashed and his predictions all came true, but long before that came to pass margin calls forced him to go nearly bankrupt. (At least that's the legend, I'm sure some historian here will say it's apocryphal.)

A few points: first, I was talking about online retailers; obviously it will be ages (or never) before you can buy cigarettes and gasoline with bitcoin. So your comment about "accepting cash" isn't really relevant.
Second, I don't know how big of a business gets a 0.25% fee; I pay about twice that for my small business and had to fight to get it. Thirdly I don't know where you got the range of 2 to 7 percent but if there are places that offer 2 percent it's better than PayPal which nearly every online business accepts.
Don't get me wrong: I'm not advocating keeping a bitcoin wallet as part of your business model, except as a clearinghouse to convert it into real money. But meanwhile there are a lot of kids who are financially ignorant and yet are "paper millionaires" -- yet the only thing they can spend their bitcoins on are reddit gold and "making it rain" over at girlsgonebitcoin. I think allowing them to spend their new found fortunes at my website makes perfect business sense.

Thanks for the answer but just offhand it sounds like a serious problem. 
Understand I am not a bitcoin user. I don't have bitcoin wallet software. Is it really true that if I wanted to install wallet software it would take 24 hours? If that is true, I would think that we have already entered the stage where the aforementioned "simplified payment verification" was already needed long ago.
And these specialists with server farms, will the day come where their task is so monolithic it's effectively impossible? Yes, computers are getting exponentially more powerful, but meanwhile the population grows and is becoming more developed, so the number of monetary transactions is also increasing exponentially.
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:04:57
Ohhhhh I see what you are saying. As if to say the US government (or any government) announces that on a certain day all of the 80 trillion US dollars floating around the world will be exchanged for a cryptocurrency (not necessarily bitcoin) at some fixed rate, like $100 = 1 unit of cryptocurrency. 
That's actually an interesting notion. It's a little bit like the conversion already made from gold-as-money to gold-backed-money to fiat-money, except instead of switching *from* a limited supply currency we would switch *to* a limited supply currency.
Ignoring the obvious--that it would take a bloody revolution to overthrow the powers invested in fiat currency--I think it would be a sensible way to kick off an experiment in cryptocurrency on a national level. Maybe some country with a horrible monetary track record like Zimbabwe or Argentina might like to try it one day.

The question is not transactions-per-second but rather VOLUME per second.  
That's not to say that transactions-per-second isn't interesting as a technical in itself, but only if it deviated from the volume chart significantly (implying that the "big money" was moving around).
In short, I love what you've done, but you need to overlay a third graph (the volume) or the chart is of no use for technical analysis.

Volume is the total value of all transactions. Like if somebody buys a bitcoin for $150 today, that adds $150 to the day's volume. Same thing if somebody sells. By the end of the day volume is in the millions, or tens of millions.
 It seems to be a law of nature that when bubbles reach their climax the volume increases to ridiculously high levels. In other words, most people buy when things reach an all-time high price. It seems ironic, but remember that it reaches the all time high precisely because so many people are buying.

Bitcoin, if anything, is the exact opposite of a Ponzi scheme.  Charles Ponzi could print up an infinite supply of his company's "deposit certificates" for new investors, the money from which was used to pay off older investors (his most valuable advertising firm!).  Bitcoin however has no infinite supply of deposit certificates shooting off a printing press: the mathematical brakes are applied irrevocably, so that dilution of the money supply is impossible.
That's not to say Bitcoin's price isn't due for a correction sooner or later, but it's certainly not a Ponzi scheme.

Two points:  
1. One person can make the price fall 50% in a minute just by fat fingering. So price-fall-per-unit-time is not the best metric to use.
2. A few hours in the life of bitcoin is like two fiscal quarters in the stock market :)

I've made a small fortune shorting the AUD this year and IMO the fun is just starting. It should drop to .8000 USD next year, unless the dollar collapses. That being said I think it's one of the most stable currencies in the world, it just happens to be in a downward spiral caused by the RBA.

Sorry to double-reply here but you were 100% right saying


...but that happens *after* the blow-out volume.  There was no blow-out volume yesterday, or the day the before, or really at all.  The price has been walked up slowly and steadily in a very thinly traded market.
Anyhow like I said, time will tell.  I have no horse in this race; I'm just fascinated by the economics of what's happening here.

A commodity like gold or crude oil or pork bellies has some purpose *other* than being used as currency. 
Bitcoin is a currency and is only a currency. If it ceases to function as a currency it will cease to function altogether because there isn't any other purpose for it.

Could you imagine what the investment subreddits would be like if somebody made a thread about every single sale that came across the ticker tape? You folks are so naive it's almost heartwarming.
Why don't you analyze the aggregate volume on a day by day basis instead of getting all slack jawed and pie-eyed over individual transactions?

You don't have problems like this with gold.

That's about as "currency" as it gets, what? That it is an in-game substitute for currency? So by your reasoning, Monopoly money is real currency? Or is it that it has a price on the open market? Doesn't that mean that things like cans of Coca Cola and used tires are also currency by your definition?
Can you please offer us your definition of currency, and then estimate how many different competing currencies exist in the world by your reckoning?

Every time bitcoin has a correction we have to put up with this drivel?
Funny that doesn't constantly post drivel like this.
If you are the kind of person who would commit suicide over the price of bitcoin fluctuating you should sell all of your bitcoins immediately and find a hobby more suitable to your personality.

Rather than use a system with a finite number of possible coins I would find a system wherein the returns approximates the curve of the famous series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 ... which does not converge but reaches for infinity, in the most excruciatingly slow manner possible.

That's a great graphic except for the stupid statement at the bottom


It's true some of the time, but unless you've got a crystal ball you have no business making such a proclamation. One thing is for sure: you won't return to the bubble price except through a long slow process.

The prices it shows are just "demo" prices, right? Because they seem to have little to do with reality. It shows crude up one cent when any other source has it down 68 cents; silver up to cents when it's down 8 cents; and so forth done the line.

By way of comparison, the most volatile "real" currency in the world today is the Australian Dollar. It is down 0.5% on the session against the USD. That is considered a spectacularly big move in the world of currencies.
If bitcoin is at $90, to declare "stability" it should fluctuate an average of 10-20 cents a day, and surely no more than 50 cents.

@_date: 2013-03-23 17:57:18
No that's not quite right either, sorry. You're in the right ballpark at least. It has to do when a trend is broken (prices undergoing a minor pullback is not a broken trend!) and the bears short sell the equity figuring on a major correction, only to see the price rocket back upwards forcing them to cover their shorts and thus sending prices higher still.
No such event has taken place in bitcoin ever, as far as I can tell from the chart.

What Hayek really was hinting at here is that in a free marketplace of currencies, the one that everybody has historically flocked towards is gold. Hayek [advocated the gold standard in 1935]( and had he lived long enough to see bitcoin would surely have dismissed it as being yet another fiat currency, devoid of any true value.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:52:44
I quoted Mankiw just to point out that "fiat currency" is not always used in the literal sense of currency created by government fiat. It was merely a clarification of terminology. Furthermore, I also recanted and agreed that Hayek would have been fine with bitcoin competing against other currencies.

Quite the opposite, I am keenly aware of it, except that I would argue that interest rate manipulation is not exactly the same thing as inflation, at least not in the modern sense. It was an effort to increase liquidity back in the days when they couldn't just mint gold coins ad infinitum.
I do happen to agree that the 1929 crash was the result of government monetary interference.  When I asked you if you contend that the '29 crash was the result of government interference I wasn't being insincere, I was just curious if that was actually your contention.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:41:17
