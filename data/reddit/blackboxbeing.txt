"True underclass"?
Nobody cares about your postmodern political theory.
People invest in cryptocurrency because:
1) the technology
2) money
And not necessariy in that order.

What if I dislike them equally?
Do I get extra woke points?

How about no.
Just no.
I find it hilarious that use 1/3 of Polish people as an illustation of Europe
Firstly, what about the other 2/3?
Secondly, no country in europe can pretend to be politically moderate.
A lot of people on the right hate the Republican party and plenty on the left view themselves as glorious radicals too woke for the democratic party.
Your perception seems rather naive to me, as someone who actually lives in America.
Candidates pull for moderate cotes in every election, which is why some people who vited for Obama also voted for Trump.

Everyone else there is LARPing WWII in the least fun way possible.

Who said this?
The right feels free to disown idiots like socialism-for-white-people Richard Spencer, unlike the left who romanticize Antifa, who compare themselves to Western soldiers in WWII instead of the Red Army whose ethos they actually praise.

If you're involved at all with crypto that just makes you another rando cryptotrader with an edgy twist that nobody has ever noticed in the market nor ever will.

Way less people know about ether than bitcoin. Even fewer are aware of ripple, golem, monero, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:52:33
Lol, literal nazis.
All 10k of them.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:30:49
Furthermore you assume that disliking both Antifa and the alt right makes someone "moderate".
It only means that you have a basic standard of decency, not that you're still picking a political philisophy.

"About 90 percent of Americans consume caffeine in one form or another every single day. More than half of all American adults consume more than 300 milligrams (mg) of caffeine every day, making it by far America's most popular drug."

Because then you can park a sports car in front of a cheap house like I've seen happen near me.

That's a valuation of about 30k per coin, ain't it?

Thankfully critiques mean nothing compared to practice.
Cue glorious Venezuela and Cuba as case studies.

Nope, Bitcoin gets the most attention because it's basically the only one the average person knows about.

Why would I use Bitcoin to buy groceries, for example, if I have to pay these transaction fees every time?
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:59:27
So you're just another opportunistic lobbyist.

The guy above pointed out the same flaw in socialism so yours is a moot point.

It's mostly fun but the dogecoin community has some... overzealous supporters for what it is.
Like calling Litecoin a "shitcoin" compared to dogecoin and stuff
