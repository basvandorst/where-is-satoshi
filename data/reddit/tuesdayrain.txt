Banks will never fully go away. Most people can't (and don't want to) handle the responsibility of being their own bank. It's a lot of stress.

The national debt can definitely keep growing forever. It's not a big deal as long as the GDP grows at a faster rate.

It's only a problem if you have a net loss :)

But his second tweet is right. Obviously people will retweet something like that. There aren't even any buzzwords really.

Some of us are just addicted gamblers. I've lost my yearly salary in 1 day before lol

You clearly have zero financial experience. 10x in 4 years is amazing by most standards. Of course it's not impressive if you start with $100 but that is completely irrelevant.

Gold's intrinsic value is significantly below market value so it may as well be irrelevant

I think good devs might have more financial incentive to implement any improvements by starting their own coin rather than contributing to existing ones.

Spoken like someone who has never heard of behavioral economics. If you really think there isn't a huge focus on mathematical modeling in economics,  it's clear that you don't know what you're talking about.

The market cap isn't how much money went into the asset so it's in no way restricted by the amount of liquid wealth.
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:04:00
I bet if you actually posted your achievements instead of making vague statements about how great you are, you'd see you're not that impressive.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:04:25
Too much space in between the bolt and bottom right half of the "B" in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:48:01


This is a non sequitur. It's an unlikely scenario for sure but it's not impossible.
@_date: 2019-12-14 06:04:41


Any source on this? Market cap does not have a direct link to how much capital was invested into an asset. Money could be invested and result in the market cap falling if the purchase was done at a lower price than what was used in the previous market cap calculation.

I can totally understand this. From an outsider's perspective, someone excitedly talking about their investment can look exactly like a ponzi schemer trying to bring in new members. It happens regardless of whether the investment is crypto, stocks, or an actual pyramid scheme. The only difference is the quality of the underlying investment.
@_date: 2019-12-25 00:54:39
If demand stays exactly the same while supply goes down, the price goes up.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:11:18
I see cryptocurrencies as financial instruments that also happen to be based on various protocols. For me and a lot of other people, there would be no interest if it wasn't for the investing aspect. It would be about as exciting as TCP/IP.

The legal system changes with community input. I would say it's a good thing that people in civilized countries are no longer owning slaves.
@_date: 2019-12-12 23:50:28
Lol at repeating things you don't understand
@_date: 2019-12-14 06:10:12
Yep nothing would happen, the market dynamics would be no different from how they are today. It's already the case that not everyone would be able to convert their holdings to something else without a large amount of slippage.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:29:25
It's pretty hard to argue that exploiting an unintentional consequence of code to obtain millions of dollars worth of an asset is not hacking

Decentralization of the development team / supply is not the same as decentralization of the consensus algorithm. The first two types, which you are focusing on, are irrelevant.
And how many commiters do you think ETH has? You're acting like it's just Vitalik when he wasn't even in the top 100 contributors for years.
I'm amused that you're claiming none of the BTC devs are holding a huge stake when it's unknown how much they have.
I doubt even you believe in the things you just said. The flat earther here is you.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:00:55
That entire subreddit is basically one guy who obsessively hates Ethereum after the DAO fork. It wouldn't surprise me if he was the DAO hacker.
@_date: 2019-12-24 07:30:41
That's the only way to gain exposure to BTC in a 401k though.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:21:37


Any kind of investing is effectively gambling. So you basically think all of finance is a scam? Lol.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:19:56
Big number impossible
@_date: 2019-12-14 05:56:23
Vitalik isn't any more a centralized point of control than BTC devs, who could presumably be pressured by a government into adding bad code. In both cases it's up to node operators and the community in general to verify that the client code is legitimate.
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:35:48
Lol oh the DAO meme again. An effect of decentralization is that anyone can do what they want with blockchain state, and the community is free to decide whether to accept the changes or not. Looking at the price of ETH vs ETH Classic, it's obvious what the majority has chosen. BTC has also reverted the chain due to bugs: 
That type of thing is inevitable with any coin that is around long enough.
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:56:31
I feel like you mentioned Proof of Stake but didn't say anything substantial about it besides the game theory being complicated. IMO it's more decentralized than PoW because everyone gets the same % return as long as staking pools exist. There are no economies of scale to be exploited like there are in PoW. I also feel that it's safer from attack. If you have a nation state trying to 51% attack a PoW coin for example, there's nothing you can really do to stop them. At best you could hardfork to use a new mining algorithm and hope that they won't adapt. With PoS you could just fork to a new chain where the attacker's balance is set to 0.

Hopefully the robbers will understand the concept of multi sig wallets and why someone can only withdraw a small portion.

Depends on your risk tolerance. It was the best decision I ever made.

If you have a keylogger and enter the private key on a non-airgapped computer then your crypto is gone. Or you can use a hardware wallet regardless of the virus and have a 0% chance to lose anything.
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:44:41
There's nothing as secure as a hardware wallet.

If you criticize someone for voting Trump, the only other option naturally becomes relevant. Trump could be the worst president in history, but if the other option was worse(not making a judgment call there), then voting for him was the smart decision.
