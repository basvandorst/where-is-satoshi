Judging by the blue colour palette it's more likely to be AliPay. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:58:19
BitPay's business model only works with an uncongested network for which payments have a high probability to confirm within the 15min window, or failing that, a protocol that gives reasonable assurances for zero conf payment to work reliably. Both assumptions have been broken by recent changes and they would have already gone out of business without the 20 million dollars they raised recently. There is only so much optimisation you could do but they are never going to make a profit at this rate.

Indeed, this is why I don't have any stakes in bitcoin at the moment. The experiment may be doomed but it is still interesting as a spectator sport and I believe there are lessons yet to be learned from the decline. 
This is not to say bitcoin cannot bounce back with some drastic, but they are easier said than done due to cruft. I would be more than happy to be proven wrong, however. 




I disagree. Alts are experimenting with many new ideals in the real world and I am quite eager to see when ETH eventually moves to PoS as it may solve the fundamental problems with PoW we have been discussing. None of them are perfect, some of them such as the storage based coins are rather silly, a few of them may be outright scams like you suggested, but the majority has been far more innovative than Bitcoin which has *just* fixed malleability several years after it was identified as a problem. 


If Jihan is really the culprit then core ought to have "fired" him a long time ago - after all he only controls ~40% of all hash power and is probably not a very bright person. But they would do no such thing, not even merging a non-controversial patch that would block covert ASICboost right away. Both sides have done a lot of posturing only to back down at the last minute because they have little leverage over each other. This cannot continue forever and I think we will find out soon when the HF deadline nears. 


Devs was said to have been working on a PoW change BIP since March and the interest pretty much petered out since then. The last reply made to the main forum thread was made [in July]( Until something more substantial comes out of it nobody would be afraid of an empty threat, especially considering that BIPs tend to remain in the development cycle for years and most of them don't even make it. 


No matter what happens down the road, crypto as a whole will be fine. As long as there is demand for anonymous P2P transactions there will be something to fill the void. Blockchain itself has plenty of utility elsewhere so all the money and effort went into R&amp;D would not go to waste, and people in future will remember bitcoin fondly as the admirable first mover who died paving the road. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:59:58
Without hash power you don't have proof of work, without PoW there is nothing standing between you and an actual 51% attack. What powers do developers have on people who actually pay for the network to exist? Are they going to hand out mining permits so everybody stays in line?
If you were to "fire all miners" then do you really expect the USAF supporters to pick things up and actually contribute in any meaningful way?
@_date: 2017-08-22 01:27:31




Have you mined in the past year, or know any actual miners who own hardware? Like the real world counterpart, BTC mining is a marginal business with considerable upfront (equipment, rent) and ongoing costs (wage, electricity, etc). Since the last halving the only profitable miners are those who build their own electrical substation to maximise the economy of scale. 12.5 BTC plus fees may sound like a lot of money, but the vast majority goes towards subsidising the remaining 99.99% of hash power that produced nothing. Indeed this is always bound to happen in a free market with quasi-unlimited supply of work. 
What's worse is that miners absolutely need prices to keep surging in order to stay afloat which in turn hurts adoption: Say I have some assets in both fiat and BTC, the former is likely to lost value over time whereas the latter is probably going to worth much more down the road, then why would I spend any of my BTC? The only way to really hurt miners is driving the price down to the point that most miners don't see any future returns (they are, however, perfectly capable of absorbing short term losses like any real world business so it's going to take a while), but this is not going to happen because it hurts all the ~~hoarders~~hodlers too. 


Agreed. I see that you are for a potential PoW change and that's a cause I could get behind as well. 


You seem to imply that every alt coin is created by inferior developers but that cannot be right. I actually agree with core on many fronts but I find this kind of hubris rather repulsive. 
Like I said above, the only things keeping BTC values high are brand recognition and a concentration of hash power making it relatively more secure than competition. However there is a real risk that both could be lost. There is a lot of innovation going on but almost all of them are happening with alts, this is the sad state of things in 2017.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:21:28


I am not sure SW has actually solved anything yet judging from the current fees market and threats of another HF. The underlying economic issues is another elephant in the room that nobody seems willing to discuss, but I digress. 




This is like saying the PT cruiser is a scam because it uses the same underlying technology found in a Ford model T.  Sure it's awful, but not for the reasons you'd assume, and nothing detracts from the fact that it is still a technologically superior car. 
Perhaps this is not the right moment to convince you otherwise, but I see a bit more value in what the alts have been doing. Heck, even dogecoin in its hay day managed to push the boundaries with things such as unlimited supply, tip bots, merged mining and more. Before you say none of these ideas were invented for the first time, I will admit as much, but bitcoin has barely changed from the form I first came across it back in 2010 when people were still debating whether it's ethical to use GPU miners. 


Which is contrary to what you have implied earlier. In any case, the 51% will always be able to force through the change they wanted. The average user wouldn't care so much about the ideologies behind it - if the network fails following a split then they will move to the next best thing. 


I really hope you are joking because otherwise core is no longer able to claim the moral high ground. Instead of creating an ASIC resistant PoW, devs would prefer to withhold information just to mess with miners.
The same cloak and dagger approach to development is why I've always been suspicious of Ver and Jihan's motives, nevertheless if core is going down the same route then I am truly glad to have dodged another bullet by getting out while I could.

Not accepting something does not make it go away. Would you still be staying on the morally superior chain if 90% of the hash rate decides to fork off now? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:26:09
How do you enforce a rule that no single entity can have 51%+ of all hash power? The network is only as strong as the sum of all miners not planning to ruin it.

Add BTC.TOP as well, they have always stood with Bitmain on various issues. Hardly news at all. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:08:13
Bitmain pitched Antminer D3 to buyers with very lucrative profit projections, yet repeatedly delayed shipment so they could mine on these machines while difficulty is low. By the time the customers received their rigs the difficulty was so high that they would not be able to break even in almost a year. The sudden influx of newly minted coins also caused a glut in the market that caused Dash to drop out of top 10 and never made it back. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:07:57
In a bull market most miners only have to sell enough to cover their costs and hold onto he rest since they are going to be worth more later. Dash miners were forced to sell the lot because they are barely breaking even, this in turn made the coin even less profitable and the cycle eventually doomed dash. 
You can probably argue the price should reflect how much it is really worth, but there is no denying that the downward pressure would not be there if ASIC miners were absent. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 03:02:59
It's not about new supply, it's about the sell pressure. 


You are quite right. Say you only spent $2000 to print those 10 coins priced at $1000 each, in that case one only need a buyer with $2000 plus a little more to cover overheads and make progress towards cost recovery. The worst thing one can do is to start offering all 10 coins on the market. Assuming the same buyers are around with ~$2000 you will only be able to get $200 per coin and they are less likely to come back for more, seeing that the coin is being dumped by everybody. 


The poor souls who were duped into buying D3 could not afford to switch off and wait because they need to make their capital investment back ASAP*, lest more X11 ASICs come online (Bitmain slashed the list price by more than 50% after the first batch shipped, while everyone and their mother are trying to offload their rigs) and push the difficulty even higher. 
Unlike GPU miners who has the flexibility to target another PoW, the only option X11 ASIC owners had was to mine while it is still (barely) profitable absorb some loss while they still can. This is essentially the classic case of tragedy of the commons where selfish actors drive the system to collapse so they could make some short term gains. The mass switch-off did not happen until early 2018 when the market cooled off. 
*A lot of them were funded by debt. In addition every cent of capital and every KWh of power spent on dash mining could not be spent on mining another more profitable coin. So there is opportunity cost to be considered as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:14:01
Sadly many posters only care about price. Anything that reflect negatively on their hodl is frowned upon here. 
On a more serious note, ~~20~~70 sat/byte is way too low. Currently the recommended fee for next block conf is about 700 sat/byte despite mempool clearing up because people are [racing with each other]( to move their coins first. I don't think fees will ever go below 200 in a while. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:14:15
I don't think a PoW change will actually happen. In the unlikely event it does then people will follow the morally superior chain.

Indeed, one needs to wait 1000 blocks or 7 days in that case. There is also the economic problem when a channel gets depleted - would anybody pay the 50,000 satoshis to close a channel that only has 80,000 satoshis left when they could just wait it out?
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:32:35
I feel for you, UX is a huge issue in this area. Although to be fair, wallets are stuck between a rock and a hard place because they are forced to practice clairvoyance, i.e. predict the future state of the network in 1 to 24 hours based on past information without knowing what is going to happen. Set the default too high people would complain, set it too low people will still complain, but now with their money stuck in the aether. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:24:00


If people really cared about value or usability they should not be using bitcoin at all - almost every alternative form of payment including fiat is better than bitcoin in some way. Moral high ground is the last bit of territory bitcoin has left now. 


Easy enough in this came: "users" of bitcoin does not want something that is working, they want something that conforms to their preexisting prejudices. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:59:18
Nobody is sure and I am only too happy to be corrected here. However given the substantial initial setup costs (a large multi-sig transaction on-chain) and the fact that funds are tangled in channels until closure, the only viable model is a hub and spoke system in which end users open up channels with a couple of intermediaries who maintains well-funded channels with various merchants. Unlikely individual users they can afford to have frequent onchain settlements because the amounts involved are larger. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:02:32
30% is more than enough to lead the price, other exchanges are forced to follow due to arb. 
For example, BCH price is almost entirely determined by the BCHKRW pair on Bithumb which has just over 40% volume, assuming all of the trades are real. The real volume is likely far lower than it seems.

Fees scale with transaction size or complexity, not monetary value being moved. It cost the same to move 1 BTC or 1000 BTC as long as each transaction have the same number of senders and receivers. 
What is happening is that miners have [received your request]( but would serve higher-paying customers first. This means your transaction is placed in a queue with many other ordered by fee. Normally a transaction is dropped after 3 days spent in the queue because it's considered stale, but not every miner does the same. Worse still, some intermediate nodes may decide to rebroadcast older transactions to give them a second reprieve, so in the end unconfirmed transaction will eventually disappear after X days in the aether following an unknown probabilistic curve. You could tell this has happened when your txid is no longer showing up on blockchain.info. After that point if you resync your wallet the money should be returned to you. 
Alternatively if your wallet support RBF (replacement by fee) you can attempt to top up your transaction with more fees and hope they will get moved to the front of the queue.

- Given the limited supply of BTC, each individual coin has to worth significantly more to support the world's need for coffee and decentralised trinkets.

They have good reason to believe that a crackdown is imminent and an organised retreat is the best exit strategy. In case you doubt BTCChina's source of info, they pulled their ICO trading platform two days before the official ban came through and certainly ahead of everyone else.

Bitcoin was not built to be democratic, it was (perhaps unwittingly) built as tyranny by hash power.

No. Nodes cannot receive fees because they only passively transfer, verify and store information without the ability to create a block. Miners, on the other hand, will look up the mempool (list of unconfirmed transactions) for transactions with the highest fees attached to them and compete to get them confirmed. If successful, they would receive the block reward plus any fees from the transactions they had just confirmed. 
There is nothing stopping full nodes to mine on the side, however as others have already explained CPU mining hasn't been viable for several years and the expected payoff from such an arrangement is practically zero. This leads back to my earlier question why would anyone bother to run a full node at all. The wiki does offer some [counter arguments]( but they feel rather weak. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:05:18
I never understood the idea of choosing the block size so every desktop can run a node in some shape and form, it is not the case now and will never happen. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:17:23
You can get $2.5 VPS instances with 500GB transfer per month so bandwidth cost should be manageable. There are also multiple reasons why running a node out of your home network is not a great idea. 
Notwithstanding that, I am not sure what exactly is the motivation for individuals to run nodes themselves if they don't mine or clear payments very often.

@_date: 2017-05-27 00:24:38
I don't really follow your argument here. I have no control over any of the other nodes on the network, does it mean I cannot trust them either? Most people cannot even manage to patch their computers in time, is it really a good idea for them to run nodes too? 
I am aware that some are advocating for everyone with the means to run a full node and use it as their hot wallet, however I am not convinced that this is the way forward.
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:38:10


In that case this miner have achieved precisely nothing because his block did not make it to the chain, only the transactions included in the successful block gets confirmed and have fees deducted from the sum transferred. 


Only one full block is admitted to the chain every 10 minutes, so there is no real way to farm a partial block with less work if I understand you correctly. 
A miner is free to pick the type of transactions they wish to verify so it is quite possible, although one has to point out this goes against their economic interest. For example, ViaBTC is offering such a [*pro bono* service]( that according to them, will prioritise your transactions on the blocks they farm regardless of fees. 
If you are looking to get into mining now, the only way to get decent returns is to buy specialised hardware and join a pool. The guide linked below is probably not the most up to date, but does a good job explaining the concepts involved in simple terms:
I can't say what kind of payout you could expect but the fundamental design of bitcoin means that they will only go down over time. Without accounting for future price speculation, the only profitable miners are those running large scale operations close to sources of cheap electricity, and quite often [in the middle of nowhere]( 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:50:35


Node operators, maybe. Nevertheless, mining is in no way constrained by bandwidth.

Source? Mining difficulty is controlled by network difficulty factor and has nothing to do with block size. 
Sure, larger blocks run a higher risk of being orphaned however we are not seeing anyone intentionally mining smaller blocks to claim an advantage because there is no advantage to speak of.
