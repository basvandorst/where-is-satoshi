There will only ever exist 21 million bitcoins.  Therefore if a person has 21 coins then that means they are in the top one in one millionth (1/1,000,000) of bitcoin owners overall.

All of their code is open source and available on Github. You an run their entire wallet locally without using any of their servers if you'd like. Do some research before shitposting.

They store the private keys but everything is encryoted so even they do not have access to your private keys. All their code is completely open source. do research before shitposting.

Do you honestly think the price could drop to as low as $200? Barring some catastrophic event, I personally don't think we will ever see sub $800 prices again.

then buy just a fraction of a bitcoin for now and work towards a whole one overtime.  it could turn out to be the best investment you've ever made :)
@_date: 2019-08-16 21:02:32
that's a pretty face

I first bought a few bits back when the price was about $200ish and have been slowly buying ever since.  I would suggest looking into dollar cost averaging and applying that theory. It has worked very well for myself and many others.

LTC was invaluable to get SegWit on BTC.  LTC went first and proved it was ready for the big time.  LTC will continue to be a great proving ground for future BIPs.  I'm sorry but you're ignorant if you can't understand it's value.

I usually move all purchased BTC immediately to my paper wallets. Therefore spending it always seemed more like a chore.  Recently however, I transferred some to my circle account for spending.

Thanks for the tip! I have will check out mycelium as you are now about 3rd person to recommend it in this thread alone.

Yes that was my initial thought as well.  I'm just wondering what is the one protocol change or concept or device that is currently missing that would make the biggest impact on adoption in 2nd or 3rd world counties.

If you use a different password for each online account like security experts recommend. Then yes, I frequently type in my password wrong for accounts that I don't use on the daily.

It's always a good time to buy and HODL before the real big fish start jumping into the fray!

Do you even understand what it means to have 62% inflation in a single year!?
Yes, bitcoin could tank but it still seems like a far better option at the moment than holding any significant amount in the Bolivar. 
Edit: you are using a time frame that works well for your argument (i.e price over the last year).  But let us expand that out a bit.  How has bitcoin done over the past 4+ years? 
@_date: 2019-05-24 20:30:11
Thanks will give that a try.
