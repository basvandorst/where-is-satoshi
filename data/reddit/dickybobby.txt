The Venezuelan Bolivar is a monetary unit as well ��

You hit the nail on the head

I’ve never seen another store of value have such relentless psychological justifying come along with it.

There are so many fucked up things about this paragraph that it’s brilliant!!

Feeling pretty good about buying in October and selling in November now ��

If by ‘stick around’ you mean continue to live a normal life and occasionally notice something about bitcoin, like its precipitous drop from almost 20K to 6K in a matter of months, then ok... we’ll stick around.

“You are aware you are only commenting on something you think is a flash fad because its literally everywhere. It’s coming to its 10th year of existence and hasn’t been out of the news for at least the last half decade and has businesses clamouring to be involved.”
Are you talking bitcoin or beanie babies? I can’t tell ��
I have no dog in this fight. I already made my duckets in btc last fall when it briefly rallied. Whether it goes up or down matters not to me, but I will say it’s much more amusing to poke fun at those who look like they’re still holding onto hope than those who’ve already cashed out or never jumped on the bandwagon.

Hahaha! This post will probably not age well.

This is both hilarious and fascinating from a psychology standpoint.

I’d rather give my life savings to Buffett and Munger than the Winklevoss dweebs any day of the week.

As a disinterested party (I held BTC for a month during the run up and liquidated it, haven’t bought back in) I think you are pretty spot on. 
There’s nothing generating bitcoin other than people who are betting (hoping) for it to go up in value. It’s not tied to actual productivity. So, while I think we will continue to see some volatility that some people will undoubtedly cash in on (and others will lose on), I think we will look back many years from now and see the bitcoin timeframe as we do beanie babies, supreme, and all manner of other fads. They have an arc that eventually comes to an end. 
But blockchain is here to stay, and has many very useful applications that can and will exist outside of simple greed. 
Those are my two cents!

By this logic I guess Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are the stupidest investors of all time. All hail you genius bitcoin billionaires!��

Loving watching this.

So bitcoin has been around ~1/3 the amount of time beanie babies have been for sale, how cute! But what’s your point? Fad products can exist long after their brief flashes are over. The pet rock I saw at the gas station counter told me so.

Sorry, not sure what happened to the link in my original post but I just added it above. Fascinating tidbits of history in there.
