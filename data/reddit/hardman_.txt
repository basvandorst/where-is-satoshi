Holy shit. I’ve heard a little about him, but that’s enough for me to switch to Gemini.

Oh that actually happened to me recently. What worked for me was getting the coinbase app and verifying my identity through there. From what I’ve gathered, often webcams are too shitty to produce legible pictures of ID.

SoulFrogs needs the insults he reads in Internet forums to be fresh and have variety, or else he’ll have an aneurysm.

My understanding is that it’s because people naturally see a whole, fun number as more significant. When we’re thinking about price progression those are the natural thresholds we gravitate towards simply because they are whole,  fun numbers. Objectively there’s nothing more significant about 7745 vs 8000, but all the traders who as a whole determine the price are inclined to think so. 
Hope that made sense. It’s self-fulfilling...

I think most young people see crypto not only as an opportunity with great potential in and of itself, but more feasible as an entry point to all things investing. At least that’s what I’ve heard many of my peers say. It’s often talk of starting with crypto and eventually getting involved with stocks and so forth.

And didn’t Dennis Rodman promote potcoin too?

You have to be trolling. Characters from always sunny do not have redeeming qualities at all. They are intentionally written to be horrible horrible people.
