Haha yeah... its like god said: oh let me create adam so he can discover the meaning of life, the universe and everything, and then let me create beautiful eve, so he doesn't

Gee, great... thats what we need to take bitcoin to the next level... crappy singers who think they can sing but actually just mumble and sound awful
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:35:30
Bitcoin rules coz unlike a bank, you can use bitcoins anonymously on titsforbitcoin

Maria Tucker looks pretty hot, so I'll give it a try
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:24:55
This is just an amazing as dogey-style

Shut the fuck up you douche bag hippie scum of the earh... enough garbage from you already on this thread. If you like getting butt-fucked from the government, its your choice. Don't use Dark Wallet. Its simple. To every faggot his own.
@_date: 2014-05-05 13:26:29
No we don't... Bitcoin community is not as lame as dogecoin losers

Have you guys seriously thought about getting back together with India, i.e. reunification. It happened with East and West Germany, may happen some day with North and South Korea. Frankly I don't know why India would even want reunification at this point given how messed up your country is.

Haha anyone who still has the hots for Demi Moore probably is old enough to be Mila's father :p
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:08:00
Hahah its a fraud ... can't believe y'all fell for that. At least you used tor right? Oh wait, you didn't ... LOLZ

I'd prefer if the QR code was either on the ass or boobs; will get more tip

Don't listen to the this guy; he's probably on payroll from some big corporation which thrives on sucking blood out of consumers. Donate to AdBlock and help make it possible to live in an ad-free world.

Ghash is by far the best pool I've mined in 4 years of mining. They don't scam you with any fees or through complicated payout ponzi algorithms like the Slush pools of the world. I'll take each and every antminer of mine and then some, and happily point it to Ghash.io even if its 100% of the network. How much is Slush and BTC Guild paying you to diss Ghash here?
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:09:31
Not a free one, anyways...

For his own good, I hope he stops this; else he may end up in some Tibetian coal mine for the rest of his life as part of the communist party's re-education program
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:22:38
Bitstamp are crooks... just some big brother government owned hooligans with sagging tits
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:14:58
I always thought that was on purpose to scare off the noobs.
@_date: 2014-05-21 18:17:24
great, exactly what we need, another hippie commie scum to come to bitcoin's defense
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:28:41
Oh cmon, Michael Jackson was also a pedophile ... but y'all still listen to him?
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:40:58
Well if Glenn Beck is buying, so am I... what more proof do you need about Bitcoin's viability?
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:27:22
Oh look fucking retard here forgot to look in the mirror... I'm not usually rude to faggots but you sir are a fucking retarded faggot
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:41:36
How did you know?!? I thought that was very hush hussh
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:25:29

@_date: 2014-05-12 20:59:53
How much do these babes go per hour for a happy ending?
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:22:15
Dumb as fuck article of the week. What retards
@_date: 2014-05-14 21:46:03
India and Taxes ... oh please, from what I hear, you just need to grease/buy off some local politicians and all is well then for you
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:08:27
Now that's the good life, noodles, booze and bitches
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:36:12
You are really puffing the good stuff stuff... I'll have whatever you are smoking man ... pass the bong please
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:20:52
Cmon guys start buying politicians already. I hear there's a everything must go sale before the upcoming mid term
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:47:20
No, this is a good thing ... it means those crooks at KnC and BFL can't overtake the network using all the preordered hardware they are premining with 
@_date: 2014-06-02 00:34:35
Man the noobs are really get slaughtered out there. It's difficult trading times like these that make men out of these boys....
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:26:04
Can we start a petition to get these two bimbos on titsforbitcoin please? 
@_date: 2014-05-17 02:41:39
What a lying douche bag... can't believe monsters like him are actually out tainting young innocent minds in schools. Pathetic
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:45:48
Better buy now before it hits $1000
@_date: 2014-05-05 23:47:02
That's 30,000 software engineers who are not getting any sex... and a great market to sell adult sized sex dolls to!

Nice to see this whitetrash sport is still alive and kicking down in the south....

If they put it behind paywall, who'll ever come. Just a quick death into oblivion. How would they all justify their lofty stock valuations if they can't use eyeballs as a metric.
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:35:32
I think its ingenious. Whoever did this is a genius!
@_date: 2014-05-11 13:09:30
Tell your principal to fuck off and remind him that despite all his hard work and efforts, he's still just an underpaid teacher and a failure at that and is only a teacher because he was too useless to do anything else or have any better careers, while you will be a future entrepreneur and when you reach the super rich class, you'll remember him and trample all over his sorry ass with a smug look on your face
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:04:02
we can, but we don't want to ... foundations are for orphans and widows... bitcoin doesn't need no foundation 
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:03:23
I wonder how many of them will end up at the Laogai mining camp, mining asbestos and other toxic chemicals with no protective gear, and just their hands while standing naked and breathing toxic acids.
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:53:01
Well Michael Jackson was a confirmed pedophile but people still worship him, no?
@_date: 2014-05-15 14:35:04
Can you use old edu address from many years ago which still works and game the system?
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:18:12
Instead of adding more sausage to the foundation, we need to add some babes
@_date: 2014-05-04 14:04:00
Maybe Demi Moore's boobs were sagging ... you know how picky guys can be when it comes to boobies
