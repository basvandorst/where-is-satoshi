What is it that allows Ethereum to handle more transactions at a cheaper rate? Is it technology that Bitcoin is likely to adopt some day?
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:12:49
Are you able to explain what kind? I'm sure you're right, I'm just looking for more of a technical explanation.

I don't even know why it even levelled off for a week in the first place. There's clearly massive momentum at the moment.

If I was suddenly given $50k I'd be very willing to drop every last cent into crypto.
If it was money I'd _earned_ as part of my life savings I'd take a much more cautious approach like the one outlined by but if it was suddenly given to me my life would not change in the slightest if I lost it all.

Yes that's true. I have no debt though :)

An international currency with complete history of all transactions that's immune to tampering from anyone, including its inventors, using the same technology that keeps online shopping and banking secure.

The subreddit makes no mention of "Cash" either. All the links are to the squatting .com domain and if you ctrl-f for "cash" there's hardly anything.

I use Electrum too. The main risk is that you pick up a virus (easily done, even if you're tech literate) that transmits your password/private key/seed. People also need to be careful to use wallet software that is trustworthy. I picked Electrum because it's open source, but even for open source projects we need to remain vigilant on every release to ensure nothing nefarious is included.
Wallet security is going to be a massive issue for cryptocurrency over the coming years now that it's going mainstream. People forget their passwords all the time and unlike almost all other password systems there is no fallback if you slip up. No "reset your password", no identify verification via ID, you just lose everything if you didn't take proper precautions.

Most of the world doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving though. I was thinking it might be because of the whole BCH fiasco in the run up to the difficulty adjustment.

That is one lucky cat.

Early blocks had a 50 BTC reward. I'm sure he did a lot of mining in the early years and it would only have taken 20k blocks to mine 1 million BTC (we're now approaching 500k blocks, for reference). If you were the sole miner it'd only take 4 and a half months.

For now we can't do much except hold.
As soon I'm able to use Bitcoin for every day transactions I will; and I will keep my BTC balance topped up while doing it.

Crytocurrency is here to stay, that's for sure.
Whether or not Bitcoin will be The One is another question. It's obviously the front runner at the moment, and has been since cryptocurrency's inception.

Cryptocurrency as a whole is booming, but it's very unlikely that many coins will get to power the global economy. Probably just 1 primary cryptocurrency and a few others that fill specific niches.
Most people are betting on Bitcoin to become that primary cryptocurrency. It's been around the longest, it was the original, its author is the father of all cryptocurrencies and it has by far the most momentum behind it.
I'm not sure why you're asking for its characteristics compared to gold and at the same time asking why it's good compared to other coins?

Quarter of a mil ain't bad. They'd have cashed out long before then.
Personally I would have likely sold part of my coins at every high (say half) keeping the rest.

Coinbase -&gt; EUR wallet -&gt; Deposit via SEPA transfer -&gt; GDAX
If your bank charges for SEPA transfers you can go through Revolut for free. Once your funds are in Coinbase you can transfer to GDAX for much lower fees on Bitcoin transactions (0 or 0.25%).
With this method it's possible to buy Bitcoin at perfect exchange rates, although the GDAX EUR exchange tends to float a bit higher than the USD one.

No, but the "Binace" logo in the top-left corner is a dead giveaway :P

Fewer transactions, but the blocks are still full (1 MB). Two reasons:
1. Exchanges are batching withdrawals.
2. People are consolidating their inputs while fees are low.

Nice I like it. And if Bitcoin ever reaches 100,000,000 USD then $1 = $1!

[Binance]( is an exchange where people trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.
Depending on Binance's policies regarded deceased individuals, you might be able to get in contact with them and have them grant someone else access to his funds. This would likely require legal paperwork (if it's even possible) as they take security very seriously.
If you're able to find your cousins password then you should be able to use that to login to his account directly, but you'll also need his phone to login if he has 2FA enabled.
You should also be aware that your cousin may not have kept all his cryptocurrency on the Binance exchange. It's possible to keep it in software or hardware wallets that require other credentials to access.

Comments can be bought. Likes can be faked. At least you had half a brain cell to only send 3.5 BTC and not your entire net worth.
Your Bitcoin is gone and there's almost certainly nothing you can do about it. Don't be so greedy for a few % extra next time.
