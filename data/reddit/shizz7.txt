That's what I want to know...lmao.

This shit's crazy, I love it! I'm in for the long run, Bitcoin - do me proud.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:02:12
To the moon, MEN! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:02:58
Hey ;)
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:32:38
I believe.
@_date: 2018-03-08 08:21:05
Let's goooo.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:31:18
Shit, sorry...Ze? Hir? I haven't quite memorised the Gender Pronouns.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:51:59
What are the two bottom sections?
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:21:56
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:54:45
The balls on this guy!
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:07:02
Agreed. I still have hope, though. I don't know if it's optimism or ignorance at this point. ;)
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:55:33
Crazy shit.
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:07:39
Good evening.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:02:32
(I hope I didn't offend anyone)
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:49:25
And pumping.
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:29:35
Let's fucking hope.
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:01:34
They're thick. It'll be left up to Australian's and European's. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:59:29
I'm not asking questions. I'm liking what I see.
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:28:44
The daily "What the fuck just happened?" post...
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:34:02
I guess it's not to be taken too seriously after all... 
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:34:32
It's totally gonna crash when BTC hits 10k.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:12:48
We made it.

@_date: 2018-03-21 18:13:15
Bitcoin is extremely volatile and unpredictable...that's why I love investing in it. As long as I can afford to lose whatever  I may invest, of course. That's also why I don't buy into predictions too much. Just "go with the flow", whatever "flow" is or may be.

Horse = Lambo
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:49:54
What a wonderful achievement. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 18:30:11
I'm with you there! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:40:37
I fucking love Suits.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:52:32
It's fucked like that.
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:27:34
Because I am a grumpy piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-04-22 10:56:37
How can't you be sure of something so simple?
@_date: 2018-04-22 11:25:12
You're an idiot for humouring such a moron. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:54:35
Sounds like a bunch of baloney. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:07:46
You're right.
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:48:22
*two hours later*
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:47:43
I'd love to know where you're getting this "logic" from...if you can even call it that.
